The Empidoidea are a large monophyletic superfamily of true flies, the sister taxon to the Muscomorpha (Cyclorrhapha). These two groups are sometimes united in the unranked taxon Eremoneura. There are some 10,000 known species within Empidoidea,Moulton & Wiegmann (2007) which are represented on all continents except Antarctica. They are known to have existed since the Jurassic period.Grimaldi & Engel (2005) Empidoidea has been subject to much debate regarding its phylogeny. Based on morphology alone, three major hypotheses had been proposed until 2007 and seemed to be consensus for some time—however, in 2018, Wahlberg & Johanson published the most current phylogeny supported by extensive genetic data, changing the relationship between quite a few families and tribes.Wahlberg & Johanson (2018) Description The majority of these insects are predatory, often with large compound eyes (sometimes covering almost the entire surface of the head), and tend to be associated with moist, temperate habitats. Many have a well-developed anal lobe in the wings, and/or a small but distinct anal cell. Several species within Empidoidea are of particular interest to ethologists and ecologists, due to elaborate mating rituals and life histories involving freshwater.none Systematics The most familiar families in the group are the Empididae and Dolichopodidae, both of which occur worldwide and contain thousands of species. The smaller families were formerly included in the Empididae, but have since been accorded family status.Sinclair & Cumming (2006) The monophyly of most of these groups have since been confirmed by subsequent studies. The Brachystomatinae and Microphorinae are sometimes elevated to full family status, too, but this would apparently make the Empididae and Dolichopodidae paraphyletic and thus they are retained as subfamilies here. Atelestidae forming the sister group to the rest of Empidoidea is a unanimous result in all studies that have utilized molecular data. The families are: *Atelestidae *Hybotidae - dance flies *Dolichopodidae - long-legged flies (including Microphoridae) *Empididae - dagger flies and balloon flies (including Brachystomatidae) *Homalocnemiidae *Oreogetonidae *Ragadidae Based on the most recent phylogenetic studies, the internal classification of Empidoidea is as follows: Footnotes References * (2007): The phylogenetic relationships of flies in the superfamily Empidoidea (Insecta: Diptera).

In December 2009, the District administration reported that 264 pupils or 16.6% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Department of Special Education.Hanover Public School District – Special Education Department – Annual Public Notice of Special Education Services The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Hanover Public School District received a $830,617 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011–12 and 2012–13 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010–11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The District must apply for this added funding. For the 2009–10 school year, Hanover Public School District was identified by the Pennsylvania Department of Education for Least Restrictive Environment monitoring. Thirty public school districts were identified in 2009–10. The district received an alert letter from the PDE – Bureau of Special Education. School districts were placed in one of three categories: Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3. The district was placed in Tier 2 due to students spending less than 40% of the school day, in a regular education classroom. The monitoring is a product of the PDE addressing its voluntary settlement in Gaskin V. Pennsylvania which ordered that special education students spend most of their school day (80%) in regular education classrooms with supplementary aids and services to assist funded by the taxpayers. In 2007, Hanover Public School District was identified by the Pennsylvania Department of Education for Least Restrictive Environment monitoring. One hundred ninety six schools districts were selected in 2008–09. The District received an alert letter from the PDE – Bureau of Special Education. School districts were placed in one of three categories: Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3. The District was placed in Tier 3 due to students spending more than 60% of the school day, outside regular education. The monitoring is a product of the PDE addressing its voluntary settlement in Gaskin V. Pennsylvania which ordered that special education students spend most of their school day (80%) in regular education classrooms with supplementary aids and services to assist funded by the taxpayers. In 2010, the District was assigned to the Tier 2 monitoring list, due to students spending less than 40% of their day in a regular education classroom. Hanover Public School District received a letter of \\"Warning\\" letter from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. =Gifted education= Hanover Public School District Administration reported that 34 or 2.07% of its students were gifted in 2010. The District Administration reported that 29 or 1.74% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing.

The policy defines bullying and cyberbullying.Hanover Public School Board Policy BULLYING/ CYBERBULLYING Policy 249 The Board directs that complaints of bullying shall be investigated promptly, and corrective action shall be taken when allegations are verified. No reprisals or retaliation shall occur as a result of good faith reports of bullying. The board expects staff members to be responsible to maintain an educational environment free from all forms of bullying. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students.Regular Session 2007–2008 House Bill 1067, Act 61 Section 6 page 8 The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives.

Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004–2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students.

Other grants The District did not participate in: Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education grants, PA Science Its Elementary grants, Education Assistance Grants, 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, nor the 21st Century learning grants. =Federal Stimulus funding= Hanover Public School District received an extra $480,674 in ARRA – Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of students from low income families. The funding was limited to the 2009–10 and 2010–2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant Hanover Public School District officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant. When approved for the grant, the district would have received millions in additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. The District was one of six York County public school districts did apply to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. =Common Cents state initiative= The Hanover Public School Board decided to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars.Common Cents program – Making Every Dollar Count After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= Hanover Public School Board levied a real estate tax of 19.4500 mills in 2012–13. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate – land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. On the local level, Pennsylvania district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75–85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2011–12 – 19.0700 mills *2010–11 – 19.0700 mills *2009–10 – 18.6900 millsPennsylvania School District Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates_0910 *2008–09 – 18.4900 mills *2007–08 – 17.7200 mills. *2006–07 – 16.9200 mills. *2005–06 – 19.0500 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by York County residents amounts to about 4.01% of their yearly income. York County ranked 232nd of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax- rates.org., County Property Taxes 2012, 2012 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008–09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances – Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010–11, 2011 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011–2012 school year is 1.4 percent. But the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, costs due to a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increased health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010–11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

Each year, the Hanover Public School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011–2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. The Hanover Public School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2011. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases.Scarcella, Frank and Pursell, Tricia, Local school tax assessments exceed state averages. The Daily Item, May 25, 2010 Property tax relief In 2010, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Hanover Public School District was $166 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 3,457 property owners applied for the tax relief.Tax Relief per Homestead 2010, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report May 1, 2010 In 2009, the district's property tax relief amount was set at $165 to 3,469 approved homestead owners. In 2010 within York County, the highest amount went to York City School District at $495 per approved homestead. The property tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $641 per homestead and farmstead in 2015.Tax Relief per Homestead 5–1–10. Report Pennsylvania Department of Education, May 2010 Chester-Upland School District was given $632 in 2009. This was the second year they were the top recipient. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially greater than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.

The orchestra’s performance season consists of Masterworks, Pops, and Chamber Music series, along with several special concerts that showcase a broad range of repertoire ranging from some of the most beloved classical works to vibrant new music, choral works, opera, and collaborations with world-renowned composers and artists. Additionally, the CSO is visible in the community in smaller venues, performing smaller chamber ensemble concerts during the year at clubhouses, churches, and private venues. The orchestra was founded in 1936 by Miss Maude Winthrop Gibbon and Mrs. Martha Laurens Patterson. It currently employs 24 full-time musicians. The CSO's mission is to inspire and engage the community through exceptional musical performances and educational programs. David Stahl, former Music Director, who studied under Leonard Bernstein and was known for his interpretation of Mahler's work, served as music director and conductor for 27 years, from 1984 until he died on October 24, 2010, of lymphoma. Stahl was credited with elevating the Orchestra to a world-class program. On November 21, 2015, the CSO dedicated its conductor's podium to Maestro Stahl. In April 2012, the CSO launched an international search for a new Music Director to replace the late David Stahl. Maestro Ken Lam was appointed Music Director of the CSO in 2014 and began his first full season with the orchestra in September 2015. Maestro Lam is the recipient of Johns Hopkins University’s 2015 Global Achievement Award, and also serves as Music Director of the Illinois Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Lam has an active national and international career with recent conducting appearances with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, Detroit Symphony Orchestra, National Symphony Orchestra, Hawaii Symphony Orchestra, Hong Kong Sinfonietta, Hong Kong Philharmonic, and at the Spoleto Festival USA, Lincoln Center Festival and Luminato Festival in Toronto. Each summer he serves as Resident Conductor of the Brevard Music Center in North Carolina and maintains his connections in his native Hong Kong as Artistic Director of Hong Kong Voices. Previously Ken held positions as Associate Professor and Director of Orchestra at Montclair State University in New Jersey, Assistant Conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, and Principal Conductor of the Hong Kong Chamber Orchestra. At its February 11, 2012, Masterworks Concert, which featured Beethoven's Symphony No. 7, the CSO performed the South Carolina premiere of a violin concerto by local composer Edward Hart, and CSO Concertmaster Yuriy Bekker played a priceless 1686 Stradivarius violin. At this concert, the Gaillard Municipal Auditorium was at 99% capacity. This concert became the highest-grossing concert in the history of the organization until a Masterworks concert on February 26 and 27, 2016, featuring pianist Sandra Wright Shen. From 2010 to 2014, Bekker served as Acting Artistic Director. In 2016, the CSO named Yuriy Bekker Principal Pops Conductor beginning with the 2016/2017 season. In response to declining access to arts education, the CSO offers a broad array of K-12 educational programming in Berkeley, Dorchester, and Charleston counties with a focus on Title I schools. The CSO plays two Young People's Concerts each season, conducts master classes and in-school performances, and hosted the National Young Artist Competition in 2014, 2015, and 2016. The CSO has repeat interactions with approximately 30,000 students per season.

It is the site of Flint Central High School, the Flint Cultural Center and their affiliated institutions. The neighborhood is occasionally confused with the Eastside, due to their proximity and similar names. Along these lines, East Villagers sometimes identify themselves as East Siders. The East Village term is included by some residents as the College and Cultural neighborhood, which is the wealthy enclave to the south east of the 4 square blocks that define Flint's East Village.  Location  There is some ambiguity among residents as to specific neighborhood boundaries. Mainly this is a result of the distribution areas for East Village Magazine. Broadly speaking, the surrounding area is bounded on the north by Robert T. Longway, the south by Interstate 69 (I-69), the west by I-475, and the east by M-54 (Dort Highway). Within this area, however, there are several smaller neighborhoods separate from East Village. These include the area north of Court Street and west of Crapo Street, named Central Park, and the area south of Court Street and west of Gilkey Creek, known as the Interchange Neighborhood and Fairfield Village. The affluent enclave within this area is referred to as the \\"College Cultural neighborhood\\" by its residents and is centered off Court Street East of Crapo Street and West of Dort Hwy, bordered by Mott Community College, Pierce Park and Woodlawn Park. In the narrowest sense, then, \\"East Village\\" consists of the neighborhood bordered on the west by Gilkey Creek and Mott Community College, and on the other sides by Longway, Dort, and I-69. The Name \\"East Village\\" This title came about as an informal designation by area residents after the 1976 founding of East Village Magazine. Editor Gary Custer has stated that the name first appeared July 3, 1976 on the initial issue of the publication. Being east of somewhere, specifically downtown, and following Marshal McLuhan's ideas that advanced communications had created a \\"global village,\\" the name was born. Custer said that the whole concept was that East Village was a state of mind, not a physical place.  History  Scenic locales like Woodlawn Park attracted development of an enclave of wealthy residents, particularly south of Court Street. More historically diverse areas, such as the area off Crapo Street to I-475 which is the real East Village, did not experience many of these the associated problems that the College and Cultural enclave has attracted. This upper-income area went through a troubled period in the 1960s during the successful challenge of housing compacts that prevented African Americans from moving into the area. In the 1950s and 60s, construction of I-69 and I-475 somewhat isolated the community from its neighbors; in particular, Lapeer Road and Dort Highway are now the only connections between the East Village neighborhoods and Kent Park and Sugar Hill to the south.  Present day  In January 2006 the sprawling St. Joseph's hospital complex was demolished and replaced with Mott Community College's Regional Technology Center, a sign of ongoing development in the East Village. Today, the East Village is one of Flint's better known smaller neighborhoods, being the site of Mott Community College, Central High School, and the Flint Cultural Center. While the area suffers from the same population exodus that has affected Flint generally, housing values have remained fairly stable. This is partly due to the expansion of Mott Community College, which took advantage of the recent demolition of St. Joseph Hospital to build a Regional Technology Center. The East Village is more racially integrated than much of the city, but remains predominantly white. References This neighborhood is legally known as Woodlawn Park.

It is alleged to be near the place where Francisco Vásquez de Coronado gave up his search for the seven cities of gold and turned around to return to Mexico. Coronado Heights is one of a chain of seven sandstone bluffs in the Dakota Formation and rises approximately 300 feet. History In 1915, a professor at Bethany College in Lindsborg found chain mail from Spanish armor at the Sharps Creek site, an Indian village excavation site a few miles southwest of the hill, and another Bethany College professor promoted the name of Coronado Heights for the hill. In 1920, the first road was built up the hill, known as Swensson Drive, with a footpath known as Olsson Trail. In 1936, a stone shelter resembling a castle was built on top of the hill as a project of the Works Progress Administration. In 1988, a sculpture by John Whitfield was placed half-way up the hill with the inscription \\"Coronado Heights 'A Place to Share'\\".

The name change came into effect on 19 January 2004. The organisation is established by an act of parliament in South Africa, and regulates the thoroughbred horse racing industry in South Africa. The organisation's motto is \\"maintaining the integrity of the sport of horse racing\\",NHA website September 2017 and its primary source of funding is Phumelela and Gold Circle, two South African horse racing companies.

He wrote: :\\"The main object of the Jockey Club and the principal occupation of the Stewards is to promote honourable practice and to repress malpractices. One constantly hears of racing scandals and intrigues. That cry has been heard for centuries. Malpractice in racing does occur - if it did not there would be no need for the Jockey Club or its officials. It is said that all crooks go racing but not all those who go racing are crooks. Ninety-five percent of the trouble is caused by five percent of the people engaged in it, and it is this five per cent who make all the noise\\". The name \\"The Jockey Club\\" is somewhat misleading and often causes some confusion because it is not an association for the jockeys, who courageously, urge their mounts towards the finish. In the 18th century, \\"jockey\\" referred to anybody who managed, or had anything to do with, horses. It was in 1882 that a group of 10 influential racing men got together in the Phoenix Hotel in Port Elizabeth to form an organisation, \\"so that all disputes in connection with various turf clubs might be referred thereto, and its decision became law\\". The organisation became known as The Jockey Club, named after its counterpart in the United Kingdom that had been established some 100 years earlier. Racing is not only controlled on a national level but also on a regional level and, in order to exercise proper control, South Africa is divided into four racing districts with Zimbabwe constituting the fifth. In all, there are 670 members who are responsible for electing the 11 Head Executive Stewards who head the Jockey Club structure. The existence of the Jockey Club and the multi-faceted control it exercises over the racing industry, coupled with the fact that it is recognised internationally, heralds an exciting and ethical future for the industry in South Africa. =Rules and inquiries= Horse racing, like any other sport, is governed by a comprehensive set of rules. These rules are designed to deal with all aspects of racing from insuring that the horses are properly cared for to serious malpractices like doping. In order to police these rules, the Jockey Club employs a number of Stipendiary Stewards, or \\"Stipes\\" for short. The Stipes are present at every race meeting and use sophisticated video equipment to help them pick up any incident that might need investigating. Inquiries are opened into any matter which appears to be suspicious and if anybody is found guilty of breaking the rules, the Stipes have the power to impose penalties ranging from a reprimand to a total ban from racing. If a person, who was found guilty of breaking the rules, feels that he was treated unfairly by the Stipes, he or she can appeal to the Appeal Board. Because the Appeal Board is an independent body, it can ensure that fair play is observed. The Jockey Club has its own laboratory that tests specimens from horses selected in every race. The laboratory uses the latest techniques and ultra- modern equipment to look for wide diversity of drugs. The screening of specimens is so successful that some people are saying that it is too sensitive and is picking up minute quantities of drugs that could not possibly have had an effect on a horse! =Licensing= An important part of the control exercised by the Jockey Club is the licensing of jockeys, trainers and race meeting officials such as the starter, the handicapper, the clerk of the scales, the judge and, also the granting of colours to anybody who qualifies to own and race, horses. Computerised administrative records are kept of over 270 trainers, 200 jockeys and apprentices, 9000 owners and 8000 horses in training. The Registrations Department also records over 10 000 renewals, changes of horse ownership's and leases each year. =Breeding= The control exercised by the Jockey Club extends to the horse breeding industry as well. Before any thoroughbred foal can be recorded in the Jockey Club's General Stud Book, the mare owner, stallion owner, mare and stallion must have been registered before the foal was born. The breeder must also provide detailed information relating to the time the mare was covered, the time the foal was born and the identity of the foal. To remove any doubt about the identity of the foal a laboratory at Onderstepoort blood types every foal and confirms that its parents are those claimed by the breeder. When millions of Rands are spent at the annual yearling sales, buyers can rest assured that the horse that they bought has the pedigree for which they paid. =Jockey Academy = The Jockey Club's role doesn't stop there, it also recruits and trains apprentice jockeys. The original Academy, founded in 1958, was situated in a house on the Berea - a suburb of Durban. In 1972, the magnificent S A Jockeys Academy designed by the well-known rugby player, Tommy Bedford, was opened on of land adjacent to Summerveld. Built to cater for 40 apprentices, the number of apprentices is determined by the needs of the racing industry. During the five years as an apprentice, the youngsters are given a comprehensive education as well as taught the necessary skills to become a competent rider. The success of the academy is highlighted by the achievements of champion jockeys such as Michael Roberts, Jeffrey Lloyd, Felix Coetzee, Robbie Sham and Bartie Liesher.

He achieved 3 hit singles on the UK Singles Chart before focusing purely on songwriting. Amongst his songwriting credits were the chart hits \\"I've Waited So Long\\", \\"Apache\\", \\"Wonderful Land\\", \\"Diamonds\\", and \\"A Girl Like You\\". Career Born as Jeremiah Patrick Lordan in Paddington, London, England, Lordan taught himself to play piano and guitar as a child. He attended Finchley Catholic High School and went into National Service in the Royal Air Force as a radar operator. On leaving the RAF in 1955, he held a number of jobs including comedian, singer and in advertising. He began song-writing, and in 1958, with the help of contacts made in the advertising business a demo of one of his songs was heard by a record producer. The song, \\"A House, A Car and a Wedding Ring\\" was recorded by Mike Preston on Decca Records. It did not sell well, but the song was successfully covered by the American rockabilly star, Dale Hawkins, on the Checker label. A later song, \\"I've Waited So Long\\" was recorded by the young Anthony Newley on Decca and got to number 3 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1959. He was signed as a singer to Parlophone and had three charting singles in 1960, the most successful being \\"Who Could Be Bluer?\\", produced by George Martin. He found real fame as a composer with the instrumental, \\"Apache\\". It was originally recorded by Bert Weedon, but Lordan did not like the version. Weedon's label, Top Rank, did not release it immediately. On tour with The Shadows, Lordan demonstrated the tune to bass player Jet Harris, reportedly picking out the tune on a ukulele as confirmed by the Shadows on BBC Radio 2 documentary, Out of the Shadows. When the rest of the band heard it, they agreed to record it. It was released in July 1960 and hit number one in August, staying at the top for five weeks. The Shadows' version was voted Top Record of 1960 in the New Musical Express Readers' Poll. The tune was also recorded by the Danish guitarist Jorgen Ingmann, who took it to number two in the Billboard Hot 100 in 1961. Lordan gave up singing for full-time writing. He wrote the Shadows' UK number one hit \\"Wonderful Land\\" (1962) and their hits \\"Atlantis\\" (which reached number two in 1963) and \\"Mary Anne\\" (a rare vocal single from the group). He achieved a further number one, \\"Diamonds\\" for the ex-Shadows' Jet Harris and Tony Meehan in 1963. Harris and Meehan also recorded his song \\"Scarlett O'Hara\\" taking it to number two in the same chart. He wrote other hits for Cliff Richard (\\"A Girl Like You\\"), Shane Fenton and Louise Cordet (\\"I'm Just a Baby\\"). By the end of the 1960s, the success was largely over and personal difficulties dogged Lordan through the 1970s. He became involved with the Cornish band The Onyx who under his guidance changed their name to Vineyard and released two singles on Decca and Deram in 1974. Later he made a brief foray in acting, appearing in the 1977 sex comedy, Come Play With Me. The film was directed by his neighbour, George Harrison Marks. In the 1980s Lordan remarried and started to write again, although his songs were never published. Personal life Lordan's first marriage was to Petrina Forsyth in 1963 (who wrote the Shadows hit \\"A Place in the Sun\\" and \\"Love, Truth and Emily Stone\\" with Hank Marvin for Cliff Richard on his album Tracks 'n Grooves).General Register Office of England and Wales, Marriages, September quarter 1963, Hampstead, Vol 5c, page 2146. His second marriage was to Claudine Albus/Hammerschmidt in 1980.General Register Office of England and Wales, Marriages, September quarter 1980, Camden, Vol 14, page 1777. Death Lordan died in July 1995 in Shrewsbury Hospital, Shropshire, from acute renal failure, aged 61. A memorial service was held for him at St Martin-in-the- Fields on 25 October 1995, during which Bruce Welch of The Shadows participated.

Then-chairman and CEO Bradley Jacobs planned to grow the company through acquisition and consolidation, beginning in October 1997 with six small leasing companies scattered across North America. In December 1997, three months after forming, United Rentals began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol URI. In June 1998, it acquired U.S. Rentals, Inc., for a sum variously reported as $1.2 billion and $1.31 billion. The acquisition made United Rentals the largest equipment rental company in North America. On December 26, 2006, United Rentals announced the sale of their Highway Technology division to HTS Acquisition, Inc. On July 23, 2007, United Rentals announced a definitive agreement to sell itself to Cerberus Capital Management in a transaction valued at approximately $6.6 billion, including the assumption of approximately $2.6 billion in debt obligations. URI's board of directors approved the merger agreement and recommended that stockholders do the same. On November 15, 2007, the company announced that Cerberus was not prepared to proceed with the purchase on the terms set forth in its merger agreement. Cerberus confirmed that there had not been a material adverse change at United Rentals, which would have let it bow out of the deal without penalty. On December 21, 2007, a Delaware Chancery Court ruling denied United Rentals' attempt to force Cerberus to follow through on the takeover bid. However, the court did order Cerberus to pay the $100 million termination fee stipulated in the original agreement. On December 16, 2011, United Rentals and RSC Holdings, Inc. announced that they had entered into a definitive merger agreement, under which United Rentals would acquire RSC in a cash-and-stock transaction.\\"United Rentals to acquire RSC Holdings\\" The largest merger in rental equipment history was finalized on April 30, 2012,Equipment World, April 30, 2012 boosting URI to what was at the time a 13 percent market share of the equipment rental industry. In 2013, United Rentals moved its headquarters from Greenwich, Connecticut to Stamford, Connecticut. On March 9, 2014, the company announced plans to acquire National Pump for $780 million.

Based on its 2013 revenues of $4.955 billion, the company was ranked exactly 500th. It had previously made it as high as 517 in 2002, before falling back down. On September 19, 2014, URI was added to the S&P; 500 Index. On January 25, 2017, United Rentals announced the purchase of NES Rentals, a competing general equipment rentals company, for approximately $965 million.

History The event of Monlam in Tibet was established in 1409 by Tsong Khapa, the founder of the Geluk tradition. As the greatest religious festival in Tibet, thousands of monks (of the three main monasteries of Drepung, Sera and Ganden) gathered for chanting prayers and performing religious rituals at the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa. In 1517, Gedun Gyatso became the abbot of Drepung monastery and in the following year, he revived the Monlam Chenmo, the Great Prayer Festival and presided over the events with monks from Sera, Drepung and Gaden, the three great monastic Universities of the Gelugpa Sect. > \\"The main purpose of the Great Prayer Festival is to pray for the long life > of all the holy Gurus of all traditions, for the survival and spreading of > the Dharma in the minds of all sentient beings, and for world peace. The > communal prayers, offered with strong faith and devotion, help to overcome > obstacles to peace and generate conducive conditions for everyone to live in > harmony.\\" The celebration of Monlam in the Lhasa Jokhang was forbidden during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), although it had not been practiced there since 1959, and would not be hosted in Lhasa again until 1986. During the late 1980s, Tibetan organizers used Monlam and post-Monlam ceremonies for political demonstrations. During Monlam, monks stood on platforms to pray for the long life of the 14th Dalai Lama, boys threw rocks at observing police, and symbols advocating Tibetan independence displayed. When these demonstrations failed to produce results, monks even suggested boycotting Monlam to show their displeasure with the government. Since security forces were prohibited from breaking up the demonstrations as \\"they were ostensibly [purely] religious\\", the city government suspended the Monlam in 1990. Monlam festivals are upheld by Tibetan Buddhist monasteries established in exile in India. Practices Examinations for the highest 'Lharampa Geshe' degree (a degree in Buddhist philosophy in the Geluk tradition) were held during the week-long festival. Monks would perform traditional Tibetan Buddhist dances (cham) and huge ritual offering cakes (tormas) were made, that were adorned with very elaborate butter sculptures. On the fifteenth day the highlight of Monlam Chenmo in Lhasa would be the \\"Butter Lamp Festival\\" (Chunga Chopa), during which the Dalai Lama would come to the Jokhang Temple and perform the great Buddhist service. Barkhor Square in front of the Jokhang would be turned into a grand exhibition site for the huge tormas. At the end of the festival, these tormas would be burned in a large bon-fire. Traditionally, from New Year's Day until the end of 'Monlam', lay Tibetans would make merry. Many pilgrims from all over Tibet would join the prayers and teachings, and make donations to the monks and nuns. Many other monasteries would hold special prayer sessions and perform religious rituals, for example some monasteries would unfold huge religious scroll-paintings (thangkas) for all to see. =Aspiration Prayers= In the Kagyu Monlam Chenmo, the main practice by the assembled monks and lay people is the Wishing Prayer of Samantabhadra, part of the preserved words of the Buddha according to the Tibetan tradition. This prayer has at its core the Enlightened Attitude (Bodhisattva Vow) of Mahayana Buddhism, that the practitioner may attain enlightenment for the benefit of all beings.

It is one of two cemeteries in the city's Jewellery Quarter, in Hockley (the other being Key Hill Cemetery). It is no longer open to new burials. A major feature is the two tiers of catacombs, whose unhealthy vapours led to the Birmingham Cemeteries Act which required that non-interred coffins should be sealed with lead or pitch. History The foundation stone for the chapel (demolished 1954) was laid on 6 April 1847. The blue brick gate lodge building, designed by J. R. Hamilton and J. M. Medland and built in 1847–8, survives, and is a Grade II listed building. The cemetery is itself Grade II on the Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest. The cemetery was originally reserved for members of the established Church of England, whereas Key Hill (opened in 1836) was non-denominational, and was therefore favoured by nonconformists. On the night of 11 December 1940, all but the tower and classical west portico of St Thomas' Church, Bath Row, was destroyed by German bombs. The church was not rebuilt. The grounds were laid out for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 when the gravestones were removed and the dead reinterred at Warstone Lane Cemetery. The gardens were re-designed as the St. Thomas's Peace Garden in 1995 in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. A comprehensive list of memorial inscriptions is being prepared by The Jewellery Quarter Research Group, to be published on its website. A campaign group, The Friends of Key Hill and Warstone Lane Cemeteries, seeks to preserve and protect the cemetery.

In their book Information therapy: Prescribed Information as a Reimbursable Medical Service, authors Donald W. Kemper and Molly Mettler defined the term to mean the right information, to the right person, at the right time, to help make better decisions or to improve a health behavior. Healthwise, Inc., a nonprofit organization founded by Kemper and Mettler to develop and supply health educational content for the general public, trademarked the symbol \\"Ix\\" to represent the term information therapy. Studies show that information therapy can improve the knowledge and medical decision-making abilities of patients, as well as reduce patient anxiety. Human factors engineer, Jeff Greene invented a web-based system that combines information therapy with a patented patient-doctor aligned-incentive mechanism, called the MedEncentive Mutual Accountability and Information Therapy (MAIT) Program. In a five-year study of an employer health plan, the MAIT Program was found to be associated with reductions in annual hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and per capita expenditures of 32%, 14%, and 11%, respectively. Greene coined the term “reward-induced information therapy” to mean providing people with the right information, at the right time, in the right way so they are more knowledgeable and motivated to make better decisions about their health behaviors and medical treatment options.

Juhi Chawla, Jackie Shroff, Naseeruddin Shah and Gulshan Grover form the rest of the cast. The film narrates the story of three prisoners and a documentary filmmaker who, while filming their reformation story in the prison, finds redemption with her own troubled marriage. The film was showcased among the Indian panorama section, at the 2003 International Film Festival of India. The film was also premiered at the Kolkata Film Festival. After having been screened at the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles, where it was well received, the film was screened at the Commonwealth Festival at Manchester, it was nominated as one of the top five films, at the gala presentation. Nagesh Kukunoor has also received the Filmfare Award for Best Story.The  Plot  Three men are on death row. Jaggu (Jackie Shroff), a lawyer and a poet, is serving a sentence for murdering his wife because she was cheating on him with another man. Nagya (Nagesh Kukunoor), a man angry with the whole world, is arrested for murdering his wife too, but he claims that it was an accident where she falls off the sidewalk while they were in the middle of a heated argument. Ishaan (Naseeruddin Shah), a happy-go-lucky man, is also arrested for murder that he commits while in the act of robbery. The prison's custodian is Mohan (Gulshan Grover), who attempts several methods to reform the prison's inmates. A documentary filmmaker, Chandrika (Juhi Chawla) comes to the jail to set a film about these three men. In the process, she finds redemption to her troubled marriage.  Production  During the film's premiere at the Kolkata Film Festival, writer-director Nagesh Kukunoor explained his thoughts behind the film's story: > I was intrigued by the feelings of a person locked up somewhere. Momentary > excitement can ruin you and confine you to a prison for the rest of your > life. In my film, the convicts tell their stories to the film-maker, played > by Juhi (Chawla). And, at the end, each story links with the others. In another interview before the film's release, Kukunoor spoke about his inspiration from a documentary film on prisoners at the Yerwada Central Jail. After watching this film, he spoke to two ex-convicts who were featured in it. After hearing to their stories, Kukunoor was interested with the premise that a normal person could become a convict so easily. However it took him three years to start writing the script. Kukunoor wrote the script in English initially and named it as Three Walls. But the producer felt that English title would take away potential audience, who would, otherwise, have watched the film. The film was made on a budget of . The budget for this film was comparatively higher than his previous films. Kukunoor reasoned it to cover the cost of three established actors, shooting in a real jail. The post- production was also relatively expensive because of the usage of digital effects and special treatment in shooting prison scenes. Kukunoor also felt that it was important for them to make the film as per international standards because it will reach the crossover audiences. On a certain occasion, Kukunoor said that he has had problems finding funds for making his films. He attributes this problem to sticking out of the stereotype. Unlike in Kukunoor's previous films, this film contains 75% of its dialogues in Hindi because the script demanded it. Since the convicts couldn't possibly speak in English, it was imperative for the dialogues to be written in Hindi. The film has a background score alone. Unlike other Bollywood films which contain songs that are lip-synced by the actors, Kukunoor felt that songs can interfere with the narrative of the film. Although he chose to use songs in Rockford (1999) and Bollywood Calling (2001), he went against using them in this film. = Cast = Apart from Bollywood Calling, which featured veteran actor Om Puri, Kukunoor's previous films such as Hyderabad Blues (1998) and Rockford did not feature mainstream actors. In this film, Kukunoor felt it exciting to cast and work with several established actors such as Jackie Shroff, Naseeruddin Shah and Juhi Chawla. While writing the script for the film, Kukunoor kept Chawla in mind for the character of Chandrika. He did so because he wanted Chawla's \\"naive honesty\\" to be fashioned into the character. Though Chawla was typecast in light-hearted roles in her acting career, Kukunoor chose to go against the norm by casting her in a serious role. The rest of the characters were cast after the completion of the script. Kukunoor did not have to convince the actors for agreeing to be cast in this film. He only depended on his script. Although the character of Ishaan was initially written to be that of a man in his thirties, he could not find a suitable actor during the casting stage. During the filmmaking, Kukunoor's experienced contrasting working styles of the actors. While Shroff preferred specific instructions from him, Shah came to him with very specific ideas. Kukunoor was full of praise for Chawla because of her suggestions during the shooting. = Filmmaking = Because the script demanded prison setting, the production team spent several days in search of a right prison. Luckily for them, they found a defunct Musheerabad Jail in Hyderabad which was soon to be demolished. After obtaining a local court's order to stay the demolition for 36 days, the crew worked hard to complete the shoot within two days of the allotted time. Shortly thereafter, the prison area was demolished and in a few months a newly constructed hospital was opened for public access. Because of shooting in the prisons, different sections in the film were given separate color treatment. Kukunoor explains this by highlighting the fact that \\"in prisons, the only source available to them in the nights is the moonlight. One or two lone bulbs burn here and there.\\" To ensure appropriateness of this scene, Kukunoor used shades of grey and blue deliberately.  Release  In November 2002, the film premiered at the Kolkata Film Festival. After having been screened at the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles, where it was well received, the film was screened at the Commonwealth Festival at Manchester, where it was the gala presentation and it was nominated as one of top five films the festival's audience loved. At a special screening in Mumbai's Sterling Cinema a few days before its commercial release, 800 attendees gave the film a standing ovation. A similar response was seen at a New Delhi theatre while the film was being screened as a part of the CineMaya Film Fest. The response from the initial screening prompted the organizers to include an additional screening to the festival itinerary. The film was to have its commercial release immediately after the screenings at different film festivals in November 2002. However it got delayed because the producers took time in trying to coordinate a simultaneous release in Indian and the international markets. A few days prior to its commercial release, the film was promoted using brochures. Though a relatively expensive approach when compared to press releases or calendars, publicity was conducted through brochures. The film competed at the box office with Mumbai Se Aaya Mera Dost, Koi... Mil Gaya, Gangaajal and Pinjar. When compared to other films, this film had little publicity prior to its release.  Reception  Noted critic Taran Adarsh found the depiction of the lives of prisoners to be realistic. He speaks high about the well-written script that were enacted and executed well in the film. Adarsh highlights the scene where Chandrika (played by Chawla) confronts her husband to be the best cinematic sequences of that time. While applauding Kukunoor for treating the subject with care, Adarsh felt that the film would only attract intelligent audiences who would choose to watch it on a DVD. In his review, he gives a special mention to Ajayan Vincent's cinematography by saying that the settings looked real. The Hindu, in its review, said: > A story that is nevertheless unusual and gripping. But you may not really > agree with the way it ends. Touches of irony, in an otherwise grim > situation, give this film its element of faint chuckles. The review adds that if the film succeeds commercially, then it is a true triumph for Indian cinema. The review by Rediff.com spoke highly about Kukunoor's strength in dealing with a genre that is not often dealt by Bollywood filmmakers. Vincent's cinematography and the background score of Salim-Sulaiman were regarded highly. The review also appreciates the performance of Naseeruddin Shah by calling him a \\"scene-stealer.\\" American entertainment weekly, Variety, said in its review that Kukunoor's story, with its twists, would impress an American filmmaking fan of Indian cinema. However the reviewer, Robert Koehler, felt that the climax of the film was \\"a desperate, showbiz move to dazzle audiences regardless of how much sense it makes.\\" Koehler speaks high about Shah's \\"fascinating portrait of the classic trickster archetype.\\" His review also highlights Vincent's cinematography to be a distinguishable asset to Kukunoor's fine filmmaking abilities.

History The Norman Earls of Chester had a hunting lodge or summer palace at Darnhall in Over parish. There was an enclosed area where deer and wild boar were kept to be hunted by the Earl and his guests. It was there that the last earl met his death in 1237. It was rumoured that his wife, Helen, the daughter of Llywelyn the Great, had poisoned him in order to favour the powerful aristocrat that her daughter had married. However, King Henry III annexed the title and its lands and spent time at Darnhall. After the Second Barons' War, the Ash Brook was dammed to drive three water mills and to make pools to keep fish.Curzon, J. Brian. It's All Over (2006) In 1270 at the behest of his son, Henry III gave the estate to the Cistercians, who built Darnhall Abbey in 1274 on the north bank of the new lake. However the land was not suitable for the grand scale of building envisaged, and the locals were not cooperative, so the monks left Darnhall to found Vale Royal Abbey in Whitegate in 1281. The first mention of a priest is in 1307 when a Thomas de Dutton is mentioned, but it is uncertain if this was at St Chad's in Winsford or as a chaplain at Darnhall, or both. The church and responsibility for the parish was given to St Mary's Convent in Chester, who appointed the priests in charge. By the eighteenth century, Darnhall belonged to Thomas Corbett (secretary of the Admiralty), and through him it descended to Thomas Corbett (Lincolnshire MP).

The Karmapas and Tai Situpas have been connected closely over time, alternating as master and disciple. Palpung originated in the 12th century and wielded considerable religious influence over the centuries. Palpung Monastery was founded by the 8th Tai Situpa \\"Situ Panchen\\" in 1727 and developed into one of the most prestigious centers in Tibetan history. The monastery once hosted more than 1000 monks and had one of the most leading monastic universities of the area. It is the seat of various lines of incarnate lamas, the best known being the Tai Situpa and the Jamgon Kongtrul. Palpung was known for its huge library with more than 324,000 texts and an art collection of more than 10,150 thangkas. It was also leading in the fields of spiritual painting and the Situ Rinpoche is the founder of Karma Gadri painting style. At the time of the 11th Tai Situ Rinpoche, Palpung was already famous for spiritual, studious and artistic excellence and authority. The monastery was partially destroyed in the late 1950s during the Cultural Revolution. The construction efforts by the 12th Tai Situpa has been in progress.

The city, besieged from October 1936, fell to the Nationalist armies on 28 March 1939, after two-and-a-half years. Madrid was held by various forces loyal to the Spanish Republic and was besieged and subject to aerial bombardment by the rebel faction under General Francisco Franco. The Battle of Madrid in November 1936 saw the most intense fighting in and around the city when the Nationalists made their most determined attempt to take the Republican capital. The highest military awards of the Spanish Republic, the Laureate Plate of Madrid () and the Madrid Distinction (),Legislacíón sobre la Placa Laureada de Madrid y Distintivo de Madrid, Revista de historia militar, , Nº Extra 2, 2011, pp. 299-316 established by the Republican government to reward courage,Luis Grávalos & José Luis Calvo, Condecoraciones Militares Españolas, Editorial San Martin, 1988, were named after the capital of Spain because the city symbolised valour and the antifascist resistance during the long siege throughout the Civil War.Second Spanish Republic 23 January 1938 Decree  Uprising: Madrid held for the Republic (July 1936)  The Spanish Civil War began with a failed coup d'état against the Popular Front Government of the Spanish Republic by Spanish Army officers on 18 July 1936. In Madrid, the Republican government was unsure what to do. It wanted to put down the coup but was unsure if it could trust the armed forces, and it did not want to arm the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) trade unions and potentially accelerate the ongoing Spanish Revolution. On 18 July, the government sent units of the Guardia Civil to Seville to put down the rebellion there. However, on reaching the city, the guardias defected to the insurgents. On 19 July, Santiago Casares Quiroga resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by Diego Martinez Barrio, who tried to arrange a truce with the insurgent General Emilio Mola by telephone, but Mola refused the offer and Martinez Barrio was ousted by José Giral. Giral agreed to arm the trade unionists to defend the Republic and had 60,000 rifles delivered to the CNT and UGT headquarters although only 5,000 were in working order. In a radio broadcast on the 18th, the communist leader Dolores Ibarruri coined the famous slogan ¡No pasarán! (\\"They shall not pass\\") to urge resistance against the coup. The slogan was to become synonymous with the defense of Madrid and the Republican cause in general. General Joaquín Fanjul, the commander of the military garrison based in Montaña barracks in Madrid, was preparing to launch the military rebellion in the city. However, when he tried to march out of the barracks, his 2,500 troops were forced back inside the compound by hostile crowds and armed trade unionists. On the 20th, the barracks was stormed by a mixture of workers and Guardias de Asalto (\\"assault guards\\", an urban police force) loyal to the government, as well as five battalions of the communist- led Antifascist Worker and Peasant Militias (MAOC). One of the battalions became the famous \\"Fifth Regiment\\"Comín Colomer, Eduardo (1973); El 5º Regimiento de Milicias Populares. Madrid. of about 10,000 fighters. The fighting was chaotic, and on several occasions, some soldiers in the barracks indicated their willingness to surrender, only for other troops to keep firing at the attackers, which killed those who had broken cover to take them prisoner. Eventually, the barracks fell when the Guardias de Asalto brought up a 75 mm field gun to bombard the complex and its gate was opened by a sapper sergeant sympathetic to the Republicans. The sergeant was killed by one of his officers, but his action allowed the Republicans to breach the walls. Many soldiers were massacred by the crowd, which had been enraged by the apparent false surrenders, after the fall of the barracks. For the remainder of the war, Madrid was held by the Republicans. However, its population contained a significant number of Nationalist sympathisers, over 20,000 of which sought refuge in foreign embassies in the city. The weeks that followed the July uprising saw a number of so-called fascists or fascist sympathisers being killed in Madrid by Republicans. For example, on 23 August, seventy prisoners from the Modelo Prison in the city were massacred in revenge for the Nationalist killing of over 1,500 Republicans after the storming of Badajoz.  Nationalist \\"Drive on Madrid\\" (August–October 1936)  The initial strategy of the military plot had been to assume power all over the country in the manner of a pronunciamiento (military coup) of the 19th century. However, resistance to the coup by Republicans meant that instead Franco and his allies instead had to conquer the country by military force if they wanted to seize power. Franco himself had landed in Algeciras, in southern Spain, with Moroccan troops from the Spanish Army of Africa. Mola, who commanded the colonial troops as well as the Spanish Foreign Legion and Carlist and Falangist militia, raised troops in the north. Together, they planned a \\"Drive on Madrid\\" to take the Spanish capital with Franco advancing from Badajoz, which he took in August, and Mola advancing from Burgos. Franco's veteran colonial troops, or regulares, under General Yague, along with air cover supplied by Nazi Germany, routed the Republican militias in their path. Yague argued for a rapid advance on Madrid, but Franco overruled him to relieve the Nationalist troops besieged in Toledo. That diversion held up the attack on Madrid by up to a month, which gave the Republicans time to prepare its defence. Meanwhile, in Madrid, the Republican government had reformed under the leadership of socialist leader Francisco Largo Caballero, whose government included six socialist party ministers, two communists, two from the Republican Left party, one from the Catalan Left party, one from the Basque Nationalist Party and one from the Republican Union. The communists were a minority in the government, but they gained in influence through their access to arms from the Soviet Union and foreign volunteers in the International Brigades. The Republican military commander in Madrid was nominally a Spanish general, Jose Miaja, but Soviet military personnel were perhaps more important. General Goriev was their overall commander, and General Smushkevic controlled the air forces sent from the Soviet Union, and General Dmitry Pavlov commanded their armoured forces. About 90% of the Republican defenders of Madrid were militias raised by left-wing political parties or trade unions, which elected their own leaders. The Republican command had relatively little control over the units in the early phase of the Civil War. On the other side, both Germany and Fascist Italy supplied Franco with air cover and armoured units for his assault on Madrid, and the Luftwaffe units in Spain, the Condor Legion, were commanded independently of Franco's officers. The Nationalists reached Madrid in early November 1936 by approaching it from the north along the Corunna Road and the west by the Extremadura road. On 29 October, a Republican counterattack by the 5th (communist) regiment under Enrique Líster was beaten off at Parla. On 2 November, Brunete fell to the Nationalists, leaving their troops at the western suburb of Madrid. Mola famously remarked to an English journalist that he would take Madrid with his four columns of regular and Moroccan troops from southwest in Spain outside the city and his \\"Fifth column\\" of right-wing sympathisers in it. The term \\"fifth column\\" became a synonym for spies or traitors for Republicans, and paranoia led to massacre of Nationalist prisoners in Madrid during the ensuing battle. The government, including Caballero, expected Madrid to fall and so made a preplanned move from Madrid on 6 November to Valencia. General Miaja and the political leaders who remained formed the Junta de Defensa de Madrid (Committee for the Defence of Madrid) to organise the republican defenders. However, the Nationalists' attempt to capture Madrid had some serious tactical drawbacks. Their troops were outnumbered by over two to one by the defenders although the Nationalists were far better trained and equipped. Another disadvantage was their inability to surround Madrid and to cut it off from outside help.  Battle for Madrid (November 1936)  = Preparations = The Republicans had a geographical advantage in defending Madrid: the River Manzanares separated the Nationalists from the city centre and was a formidable physical obstacle. Mola planned his assault on Madrid for 8 November 1936. He planned to attack through the Casa de Campo park on a front of only wide to try to avoid street fighting, as the park was open country and lay just across the river from the city centre. Mola's initial intention was to take the University City, just north of the city centre, to establish a bridgehead across the Manzanares. He also launched a diversionary attack towards the working-class suburb of Carabanchel, to the south-west of the city centre. However, on 7 November, the Republicans had captured plans of the attack on the body of an Italian officer found in a destroyed tank by several militia units and so could to concentrate their troops in the Casa de Campo to meet the main attack. Its strategic location over the Manzanares River made the Bridge of the French have of a crucial importance. Colonel Romero commanded Republican forces there and effectively repelled attempts to cross it and to gain access to Madrid's city centre.Salas Larrazábal, Ramón, Historia del Ejército Popular de la República. Editora Nacional, Madrid (España) , p. 1524, 1579. = Initial attack = Mola attacked on 8 November with 20,000 troops, mostly Moroccan regulares, supported by Italian light armour and German Panzer I tanks under German officer Wilhelm Von Thoma. The German Condor Legion also provided air support, which took a heavy toll on the buildings of the quarter. The Republicans had deployed 12,000 troops in Carabanchel and 30,000 more to meet the main assault at the Casa de Campo. Despite their superiority in numbers, they were very badly equipped since they had mostly only small arms, with reputedly only ten rounds for each rifle. In addition, most of them had never been trained in the use of weapons, let alone experienced combat before. Nevertheless, they held off the Nationalist onslaught at Casa de Campo. Some regulares eventually broke through and made an initial crossing over the Manzanares towards the Modelo Prison, the target of the offensive, but the attack stalled at the western fringe of the city. The Republican General Miaja himself reputedly raced to the ruined buildings to which the Republican troops were starting to flee and, pistol in hand, called upon the retreating troops to rally and die with him, rather than flee as cowards. Throughout the day, the city radio called upon the citizens to mobilise and support the front, with the rallying cry \\"¡No pasarán!\\" ('They shall not pass!') Late on 8 November, the first International Brigade, the XI numbering 1,900 men, arrived at the front, marching through the Gran Via in the city centre. Although few and with their training unfinished, since they had been hurried to the front as a relief force, their arrival was a major morale boost for the defenders of Madrid. The foreign troops, while actually a mixture of volunteers from Germany, France, Britain and various other nations, including Winston Churchill's nephew, Esmond Romilly, were greeted with cries of vivan los rusos (\\"long live the Russians\\") by madrileños since they had been mistaken for Soviet infantry. = Stalling and counterattacks = On 9 November, the Nationalists switched the focus of their offensive to the Carabanchel suburb, but the heavily-urban area proved to be a very difficult obstacle. The colonial Moroccan troops were pinned down in house-to-house fighting (in which they had little previous experience since their greatest strength was in open-country warfare) and took heavy casualties at the hands of militiamen who knew the urban terrain very well. In the evening of 9 November, General Kléber launched an assault of the XI International Brigade on the Nationalist positions in the Casa de Campo, which lasted for the whole night and part of the next morning. At the end of the fight, the Nationalist troops had been forced to retreat and abandoned all hopes of a direct assault on Madrid through the Casa de Campo, while the XIth Brigade had lost a third of its men. Meanwhile, Republican troops counterattacked all along the front in Madrid, on 9, 10 and 17 November, driving the Nationalists back at some places but taking heavy casualties in the process.Boadilla by Esmond Romilly, The Clapton Press, London. 2018. On the 10th, 4,000 Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) anarchist, militiamen led by Buenaventura Durruti, arrived from the Aragón front as reinforcements for the defence of the capital. On 11 November, an infamous massacre occurred on the Republican side; 1,029 Nationalist prisoners held in the Model Prison were taken out and killed in the Jarama Valley by the Republican 5th regiment as potential \\"Fifth Columnists\\". It has been alleged that the killings were ordered by the communist leader Santiago Carrillo, but that has never been proved. According to Antony Beevor, the order for the massacre came from either José Cazorla Maure, Carrillo's deputy, or the Soviet advisor, Mikhail Koltsov. The atrocity was condemned by the anarchist director of prisoners, Melchor Rodriguez. Colonel Romero had disagreements with anarchists, asked for the dismissal of Ricardo Sanz and proposed the dissolution of the Durruti Column and the distribution of their men among other units.Historia del Ejército Popular de la Republica, op.cit. Editora Nacional, p. 784, note 5. On the 12th, the newly-arrived XII International Brigade, under General Mate \\"Lukacs\\" Zalka with German, Scandinavian, French, Belgian and Italian troops, launched an attack on Nationalist positions on the Cerro de los Ángeles hill, south of the city, to prevent the cutting off of the Valencia road. The attack collapsed because of language and communication problems and insufficient artillery support, but the road to Valencia remained open. = Final Nationalist assault = On the 19th, the Nationalists made their final frontal assault. Under cover of a heavy artillery bombardment, Moroccan and Foreign Legion troops fought their way into the University City quarter of Madrid. While their advance was checked, they established a bridgehead over the River Manzanares. Bitter street fighting ensued, and Durruti, the anarchist leader, was killed on the 19th, reportedly by the accidental discharge of one of his own men's weapons. Despite fierce counterattacks by the XI International Brigade and Spanish Republican units, the Nationalists kept their toehold in the University City and, by the end of the battle, were in possession of three quarters of the complex. However, their attempt to storm Madrid had failed in the face of unexpectedly-stiff Republican resistance. Franco stopped further infantry assaults, as he could not risk losing any more of his best regulares and legionnaire troops. = Aerial bombardment = Fiat CR 32s, flown by Italian pilots, provide fighter cover. Having failed to take Madrid by assault, Franco ordered the aerial bombardment of the city's residential areas except for the upper-class Salamanca district, which was assumed to contain many Nationalist supporters, with the intention of terrifying the civilian population into surrender. Franco is quoted as saying, \\"I will destroy Madrid rather than leave it to the Marxists\\". German bombers pounded the rest of the city from 19 to 23 November. Arguably, that tactic by Franco was counter- productive, as the Republican population in Madrid was not cowed into surrender, and the aerial bombardment of civilians, one of the first in the history of warfare, was heavily criticised by foreign journalists such as Ernest Hemingway. The casualties from the aerial bombardment seems to have been relatively low, however. There is no definitive figure for the civilian casualties it caused, but according to Hugh Thomas, the death toll was about 2000. From early 1937 onward, fighter resistance and Republican pilots' experience had also grown too strong for further bombing to occur during daylight, which further limited its effectiveness.\\"Chewed Up\\" - Time, Monday, 5 April 1937 = Stabilisation of front = The battle petered out in December, with both sides exhausted. A frontline stabilised in the city, running from the Nationalist salient over the River Manzanares, in the University City, through the Casa de Campo park, and through the streets of the Carabanchel area Madrid was subjected to a sporadic artillery and aerial bombardment, and food became short as the winter went on. The UGT transferred some vital industries to metro tunnels under the city that were not in use. Franco's final action of 1936 was to attempt to cut off the road to Corunna, north-east of Madrid, as the first step towards surrounding the Spanish capital. The resulting Battle of the Corunna Road also resulted in a stalemate. The casualties inflicted in the Battle of Madrid were never accurately counted, but the British historian Hugh Thomas estimated that they were a total about 10,000 for both sides and the civilian population.  Battles around Madrid (1937)  After the Battle of Madrid, the Republican government tried to reorganise its armed forces from a collection of militias into a regular army, the People's Republican Army. That was achieved by integrating the militias into the structures of the elements of the prewar army that had sided with the Republic. In theory, it reduced the power of political parties relative to the government, but in practice, it increased the influence of the Communist Party, which led the implementation of the policy through the loyal, disciplined and militarized units of its Antifascist Worker and Peasant Militias (MAOC).De Miguel, Jesús y Sánchez, Antonio: Batalla de Madrid, in his Historia Ilustrada de la Guerra Civil Española. Alcobendas, Editorial LIBSA, 2006, pp. 189-221. Also close to the Communist Party were the Soviet arms providers and foreign volunteers and advisers, both groups providing much of the practical military experience on the Republican side. The party, therefore, had a disproportionate influence in the appointment of military commanders and the setting of military policy. In 1937 were two major battles in the immediate area around Madrid, the Battle of Jarama (January to February) and the Battle of Brunete (July). In addition, two other battles were fought further afield as part of the Nationalist campaign to take the capital: in March, at Guadalajara and at the end of December at Teruel, both north east of Madrid. The first battle in early 1937 had Franco try to cross the River Jarama to cut off the road between Madrid and Valencia, where the Republicans had moved their government. The results were inconclusive. Franco's troops managed to get onto the east bank of the Jarama but failed to sever communications between Madrid and Valencia. Casualties on both sides were heavy, estimates of losses ranging from 6,000 to 20,000 on each side. In March, the Battle of Guadalajara was fought about 60 km north-east of Madrid when Republican troops routed an attempt by Italian troops to cross the Jarama, encircle Madrid's defences and launch an assault on the city. Around a third of the city of Madrid heavily damaged, but morale remained still strong in the population, and Madrilenes prided themselves of doing \\"business as usual\\" under fire.Business & Blood - Time, Monday, 19 April 1937 In May, Republican forces under the Polish communist officer Karol Świerczewski, tried to break out of Madrid in an armoured assault but were beaten back. A far more ambitious northern offensive was launched by the Republicans in July with the intention of encircling the Nationalists. However, the Battle of Brunete again developed into a bloody stalemate. The initial Republican attack took Brunete and pushed back the Nationalist front some 12 km, but determined Nationalist counterattacks retook this territory by the end of the battle. Republican losses were significantly higher than those of the Nationalists. In late 1937, the Nationalists took much of northern Spain, the country's industrial heartland, with its many arms factories, which had sustained the Republican war effort. At the very end of the year, the Republican commander of the IV Corps, Cipriano Mera intercepted Nationalist plans for a fresh assault on Madrid from the direction of Zaragoza. General Vicente Rojo launched a pre-emptive offensive of his own, with over 100,000 men on 15 December and took the town of Teruel. Rojo's offensive put paid to Franco's proposed assault on Madrid but led to one of the bloodiest battles of the war , with over 100,000 casualties on both sides.  Infighting and fall of Madrid (1938–March 1939)  The Valle de los Caidos or 'Valley of the fallen', a colossal memorial built by Franco near Madrid after the war, to commemorate dead from both sides. In 1938, the siege of Madrid tightened and its population suffered increasingly from a lack of food, warm clothes and arms and ammunition. However, Franco had by now given up on the idea of another frontal assault on the city but was happy to constrict the siege gradually and to continue to bomb the city. By the spring of 1939, after the collapse of the Republican forces on other fronts, the Republican cause in Madrid was clearly doomed, which created a bitter division within Republican ranks. On one side was the socialist Prime Minister Juan Negrín, some other government ministers and the Communist Party, who wanted to fight to the end. They were opposed by the Republican Colonel Segismundo Casado and others, who wanted to negotiate the surrender of Madrid to spare Republican supporters the worst of the Nationalist retribution. On 5 March, Casado's men arrested communist officers in Madrid, stripped them of their powers, deposed Negrín and established the National Defence Council (Consejo Nacional de Defensa) to negotiate a peace deal with Franco. The next day, the communist leaders and Negrín fled Spain from Elda, but the communist troops settled around Madrid rejected the authority of the Council and entered Madrid on the 7th. There were some days of fighting in the streets between communist and non-communist troops, which ended with the defeat of the communists and the execution of their leader, Luis Barceló. That left Casado free to try to negotiate terms with Franco. However, the Nationalist leader insisted that unconditional surrender was all that he would accept. On 26 March, Franco ordered a general advance into Madrid, and on the 27th, the Republican front collapsed, many of whose troops surrendered or simply threw away their weapons and started for home. On 28 March, Madrid finally fell to Franco's forces. In spite of Casado's efforts at negotiation, many of the Republican defenders of Madrid were among the almost 200,000 people who were executed or died during imprisonment by Franco's regime between 1939 and 1943.Jackson, Gabriel.

The besieged capital of Spain, with the enemy so close, yet unable to take the city for years on end, became the subject of songs, such as Los Emboscados — a version of Si me quieres escribir,Si me quieres escribir - Ya sabes mi paradero - El Frente de Gandesa - Los emboscados and poems like this one by renowned poet Rafael Alberti, Madrid, corazón de España, which begins thus: { :Madrid, corazón de España, :late con pulsos de fiebre. :Si ayer la sangre le hervía, :hoy con más calor le hierve. :Ya nunca podrá dormirse, :porque si Madrid se duerme, :querrá despertarse un día :y el alba no vendrá a verle. :No olvides, Madrid, la guerra; :jamás olvides que enfrente :los ojos del enemigo :te echan miradas de muerte.  :Madrid, heart of Spain, :Throbbing with the beats of fever. :If yesterday her blood was boiling :Today it boils with more heat. :She will never be able to sleep, :Because if Madrid falls asleep, :She will wish to wake up one day :And dawn will not come to meet her. :Don't forget, Madrid, the war; :Never forget that in front :The eyes of the enemy :Are throwing at you looks of death.Romance de la defensa de Madrid - Poesía española } See also * Gómez Ulla Military Hospital *Los Emboscados  References   Bibliography  * Chris Bishop, Ian C.

Typically the correction techniques involve the physical and electrical characterisation of the motional inductance and terminal capacitance of a crystal blank, the knowledge of which is used to create a correction polynomial, or algorithm, which in turn is implemented in circuit blocks. These are usually simulated in a mathematical modeling software tool such as SPICE, to verify that the original measured data can be corrected adequately. Once the system performance has been verified, these circuits are then implemented in a silicon die, usually in a bulk CMOS technology. Once fabricated, this die is then embedded into an oscillator module along with the crystal blank. Due to the sub accuracy of this type of crystal oscillator specialist packaging must be used to ensure good ageing and temperature shock characteristics. Example applications are for use in low power or battery operated consumer electronic products such as GSM or CDMA mobile phones, or GPS satellite navigation systems.

It stars Robert Foxworth, Talia Shire and Armand Assante. Set in the Androscoggin or Ossipee River, the film follows an environmental agent and his wife filing a report on a paper mill in the river, not knowing that the paper mill's waste made a local bear mutate, causing the bear to run amok in the wilderness. A novelization of the film, written by Seltzer as well, was also published, with the tagline \\"A Story of Unrelenting Terror\\". Plot While searching for lost lumberjacks, three members of a search-and-rescue team are killed by an unseen force. Dr. Robert Verne accepts a job from the Environmental Protection Agency to write a report about a dispute between a logging operation and a Native American tribe near the Androscoggin River or Ossipee river in Maine. Dr. Verne's wife Maggie accompanies him on the trip. She is pregnant, but is apprehensive to tell her husband as he is against having children. In the town, the local paper mill director, Bethel Isely blames the Native Americans, dubbed Opies (short for \\"original people\\") for the missing lumberjacks and rescue team. The Opies instead blame Katahdin, a vengeful spirit of the forest that has been awakened by the activities of the loggers, which Isely describes as \\"larger than a dragon with the eyes of a cat\\". The Vernes are disturbed when they witness a confrontation between the Opies and Isley's bodyguard, Kelso, which nearly results in the death of an Opie, John Hawks. The Vernes see several signs of environmental damage: a salmon large enough to devour a duck; a deranged, vicious raccoon; plant roots growing on the surface; and a bullfrog-sized tadpole. Hawks and his friend Ramona ask Verne to include Opie perspectives in his report. They believe the paper mill operations are somehow causing grave danger to the environment and people alike. Hector M'Rai, Ramona's grandfather, claims to have seen Katahdin and describes him as \\"part of everything in God's creation\\". Verne and Maggie tour the paper mill to look for incriminating evidence. Although Isely insists the mill has excellent safety protocols, Verne notices that Maggie's boots have mercury deposits—a mutagen that causes birth defects, it is used in logging as a fungicide and does not show up in water purity tests because it sinks to the bottom. Verne needs more evidence and determines to take blood tests from the Opies. That night, the Nelson family, who have set up a camp in the woods, are killed by Katahdin, a large bear with one of its sides containing horribly mutated skin. Isely and Sheriff Bartholomew Pilgrim believe Hawks and the Opies are responsible and try to arrest them. However, Hawks escapes. Verne, Maggie, and Ramona take a helicopter to the campsite to investigate the killings. Verne and Ramona find huge scratch marks on the trees, while Maggie finds two mutated bear cubs, one dead and one alive, trapped in a salmon poacher's net. Forced to spend the night in the woods due to inclement weather, they nurse the cub back to health inside one of Hector's tepees. A distressed Maggie explains to Verne about her pregnancy and that she has eaten contaminated fish. Isely and Sheriff Pilgrim arrive and, upon seeing the mutant cub, accept that Hawks and his men are innocent of any crime. Katahdin arrives and attacks the camp in search of her cub. Pilgrim is killed, but the others escape through tunnels beneath Hector's home. The next day, Isely tries to reach a nearby radio tower to call for help, but is killed by Katahdin. Later that night, she attacks the truck in which the others are driving away. They swim across a river to a log cabin. Verne drowns the cub when it attacks Maggie. Katahdin kills Hector and Hawks, and knocks Ramona and Maggie unconscious. Verne stabs Katahdin repeatedly, forcing her into the lake where she drowns. The next day, Verne and Maggie escape, unaware that another mutant creature (the cubs' father) is still active within the forest. Cast Production Filmed in British Columbia, Canada in 1978, this film marked the beginning of \\"Hollywood North\\", the major start to the development of a massive film production business in Vancouver and other areas within the province. Since then, hundreds of \\"American\\" movies have been filmed in the Canadian province. Some violence/gore and other scenes were deleted, not because of the censors, but on a decision made by John Frankenheimer. This included a longer close-up of a man's headless corpse and a shot of Katahdin graphically disemboweling Isley (both deemed \\"gratuitous\\"), a flashback to the night where Rob and Maggie have sex (deleted for time), and extensions of several scenes, including a longer tour of the paper mill and Rob fishing, which showed him falling asleep and later waking up in the sun. The original concept for Katahdin was considerably more terrifying than what would eventually show up on screen. However, when director John Frankenheimer saw the concept, he suggested that it should be altered to look more \\"bear-like\\". The original concept was actually quite close to the poster art. Frankenheimer considered Prophecy a film with far more potential than what he eventually delivered, ostensibly due to his alcoholism. Release =Theatrical= Prophecy was given a theatrical release in the United States by Paramount Pictures on June 15, 1979. It opened on 775 screens grossing $6,720,000 in its opening week. It grossed $22.7 million at the U.S. box office. =Home media= The film was released on Blu-ray on November 26, 2019. Reception As of August 2020, review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave Prophecy an approval rating of 24%, based on 17 reviews, with an average rating of 4.38/10. On Metacritic, as of August 2020, the film had a weighted average score of 41 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film \\"epically trivial\\" and \\"a feeble attempt to recycle the sort of formula movie one expects from American International Pictures.\\" Variety called it \\"a frightening monster movie that people could laugh at for generations to come, complete with your basic big scary thing, cardboard characters and a story so stupid it's irresistible.\\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the monsters were \\"not particularly effective\\" on the screen and that the film \\"never approaches the chill factor of 'Alien,' for example.\\"Champlin, Charles (June 15, 1979). \\"Muted Mutant in 'Prophecy'\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called it \\"essentially an indoctrination course in liberal guilt, shabbily disguised as a monster melodrama. Indeed, it's such a motley monster picture that it may be lucky to attract fleeting snickers as a kind of poor man's 'Alien.'\\" Tim Pulleine of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that \\"once the narrative gets properly under way, the ecological sub-text virtually drops out of sight. As, even more confusingly, does the sub-plot about the heroine's pregnancy, leaving only a surfeit of creature-on-the-rampage hokum.\\" Richard Scheib criticized the film's monster costume, photography, and lack of suspense stating, \\"much of the film teeters on the brink of this unintentional absurdity and fails to emerge on the winning side. John Frankenheimer tries hard to generate tension during the scenes with the mutant bear pursuing the cast near the end, but much of the story is predictable and boring\\". Cinema de Merde.com said \\"You don’t get a lot of killing and the terror and suspense sequences really aren’t that great, but it makes up for that in the sheer flamboyance of some of its touches, such as the amazing exploding sleeping bag. It’s a bit of a bummer that after all the build-up, the thing turns out to be a boring old mutant bear, like ANY other mutant bear, but this is only because expectations have been raised\\". Patrick Naugle from DVD Verdict wrote, \\"In an age of self-referential and cynical Scream horror movies and Silence of the Lambs knock offs, Prophecy has a certain something that just can't be denied. Prophecy even contains a MESSAGE (re: don't mess with Mother Nature or you'll be sorry), which is more than I can say for most horror movies produced today. Is it scary? No. Vastly amusing? You bet your bottom dollar\\". Quentin Tarantino later wrote, \\"I kind of have a soft spot in my heart for this stupid ass movie. Aside from the bonkers bear monster, the films one saving grace is Talia Shire.\\" References External links  1979 films 1979 horror films 1970s monster movies 1970s science fiction horror films American monster movies American natural horror films American science fiction horror films American films English-language films Films about bears Films directed by John Frankenheimer Films scored by Leonard Rosenman Films set in forests Films set in Maine Films shot in British Columbia Paramount Pictures films ","title":"Prophecy (film)"},{"id":"5722018","text":"MICS or mics may refer to: *Master of Information and Cybersecurity *Medical Implant Communication Service, a specification for a frequency band used by medical implants * Microphones * Minimal inhibitory concentrations, in microbiology, the lowest concentrations of antimicrobials that will inhibit growth of a microorganism * Minimally invasive cardiac surgery, refers to alternative approaches to heart surgery, making use of several small incisions instead of the traditional open-chest procedure * Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, a household survey program developed by UNICEF * Member of the Irish Computer Society * Member of the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers * Modular Integrated Communications System (MICS), a phone system by Norstar See also *MIC (disambiguation) ","title":"MICS"},{"id":"5722021","text":"Skilandis Skilandis or Kindziukas is a Lithuanian matured sausage made of meat, fat, salt, pepper and garlic.

As the play opens, he is seen arguing with and eventually beating his wife, Martine, who then decides to take revenge. As she is plotting, she hears two passing servants of a rich man mention their frustration at being unable to find a doctor who can cure their master's daughter's mysterious illness. She convinces the two that her husband is an eccentric but brilliant doctor, whom they must beat into admitting his identity. The servants find Sganarelle cutting wood and drinking in the woods nearby and beat him until he finally admits to being a doctor. The servants take him to meet their master, Geronte, and his daughter Lucinde who has become mysteriously mute. Sganarelle spends his first session with her frantically trying to pass as a real doctor, mainly out of fear of being beaten again. When he sees how much Geronte is willing to pay him, however, he decides to give up woodcutting and remain a \\"doctor\\" for the rest of his life. Eventually Sganarelle discovers that his patient is in fact only pretending to be ill, because she is betrothed to a rich man whom she does not love. Farcical comedy ensues, climaxing with Sganarelle being discovered and almost executed. The play ends with a classical moment of deus ex machina; with Lucinde's love, Geronte's wishes, and Sganarelle's fate being neatly and happily resolved.

He was appointed Medical Officer of Health for the City of Aberdeen in 1888, a post he held until 1923. He was also Professor of Forensic Medicine at the University of Aberdeen. Matthew Hay was born at Hill Head, Denny, Stirlingshire on 27 December 1855. His father was a colliery owner. Hay was academically gifted attending Dollar Academy before going on to Glasgow and Edinburgh universities, graduating from the University of Edinburgh Medical School with the degree of MB, CM with distinction in 1878. At Edinburgh he distinguished himself by winning the Ettles prize for medicine and the Goodsir Fellowship and worked as an assistant to Richard Fraser, professor of Materia Medica. In 1884 Hay was offered and accepted the chair of pharmacology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins University medical school, Baltimore. He did not take up the positions because of a dispute with Johns Hopkins over his intention to continue treating private patients. Baltimore's loss was to prove to be Aberdeen's gain when Hay, aged 27, successfully applied for the Chair of Forensic Medicine at Aberdeen University. Hay's career in Aberdeen was not limited simply to the lecture theatres of the University. In 1888, he was appointed the city's Medical Officer of Health. It was in his capacity as the Medical of Health that Hay made an important contribution to solving the public health issues of Aberdeen's working class housing problem through the promotion of the Aberdeen (Housing of the Working Classes) Improvement Scheme 1894.Aberdeen Inorovement Scheme Provisional Order Confirmation Act 1896 (59 & 60 Vict. c6) Foresterhill Professor Hay is known as the father of the Aberdeen Joint Hospitals Scheme. He promoted the development of an integrated medical campus at the Foresterhill site in Aberdeen. Central to his vision for a healthier community was the bringing together of health services for the public with a medical school on the one site, and in 1900 he pinpointed the barren slope of Foresterhill outside the city centre as the ideal location for his dream. Having convinced the City Fathers of the need for this scheme, work begin on the Foresterhill site in 1926. Since then, Foresterhill has grown to become one of the largest health campuses in Europe, serving the communities of the north-east of Scotland, islands and beyond. The educational and research presence is strong on the site, with a large Medical School and new Institute of Medical Sciences and Institute of Applied Health Science. Matthew Hay's vision is fulfilled with the opening of the Suttie Centre for Teaching & Learning in 2009. Matthew Hay's role in Aberdeen's Slum Clearance Since the enactment of the Public Health (Scotland) Act 1867,30&31 Vict. c101 local authorities had been empowered to appoint Medical Officers (the term 'Medical Officers of Health' came into use later) and to raise money by local rates for public health purposes.Derived from an M.Litt dissertation written by Alexander M S Green in 2009 for the degree of M.Litt from the University of St Andrews Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen were exceptionally represented by three pioneering Medical Officers: James Burn Russell, Henry Littlejohn and Matthew Hay. These men laboured tirelessly to improve the public health and housing of the cities where they worked. Russell, or ‘Glasgow’s Doctor’,Edna Robertson 'Glasgow's Doctor - James Burn Russell 1837' (East Linton: Tuckwell Press) 1998 is today perhaps the best known of the three, whilst Hay (in relation to housing improvement) is the least remembered. The fact that Hay is not remembered today should not detract from his valuable contribution to the development of public health and Aberdeen's programme of urban regeneration. Not only was he the originator of the Aberdeen Joint Hospitals scheme (a world first in the organisation of hospital care and medical teaching), but he was also a key figure in the working class housing improvement scheme adopted by Aberdeen Town Council in 1894. At the time of his death in 1932, Hay's national importance was in no doubt. In his obituary, he was described as ‘one of the best known medical men in the Kingdom’ who would be remembered in Aberdeen: Having served the city for 35 years, Hay was in a strong position to take the long view and he was eminently well qualified to assess the effectiveness of Aberdeen's response to the housing crisis. For example, in 1902, mid way into his term as Medical Officer, Hay presented a paper on the Glasgow Corporation Water and City Improvements Bill. In doing so, he spoke about the housing problem in Aberdeen where the city had closed slums down too rapidly without finding alternative accommodation for the displaced occupants. In his mind, the problem of homelessness had become so acute that the city had to re-open some slum properties. From 1850 onwards he argued that private enterprise had failed to deal with the city's chronic problem of overcrowded slums. He believed that private enterprise could not meet the housing needs of the poor because of their desire to make as much profit as possible. Additionally middle class landlords (who comprised the overwhelming majority of the city's renter class) tended to lease their properties to artisans rather than to the very poor because of the deleterious effect they feared the latter would have on those properties. In Hay's opinion, having cleared the slum properties, the private entrepreneur would not build to house the displaced occupants; he therefore believed that the Aberdeen Town Council should obtain the power to provide the accommodation to house the displaced population of the city. He was a vocal advocate of municipal intervention to solve the city's housing problem. For social historians Hay's observations were typical of the time and reflected a dynamic change in the interaction between social problems, social thought and social action from the 1880s onwards and his work must be understood in the context of that change. As the population of Britain's cities grew, so too did the problem of housing the poor. Slum dwelling, the public health and public order issues that were associated with overcrowded and insanitary housing challenged the minds of philosophers, sociologists, charities, philanthropists, local government and national government for decades. Were the poor morally blameworthy for their own condition? Why were there slum dwellings? How were the poor to be housed and who had the responsibility for housing them? These were questions that went to heart of how the late Victorians and Edwardians understood the very nature of society. The proposed solutions evolved and illustrate that in studying the intellectual and social history of the period, it is difficult to establish a causal nexus between social thought and social action. It is superficially attractive to presume that a particular social theory finds expression in social action and social change and that the historian is simply tasked with producing evidence from primary sources to find the link. This is an overly simplistic approach because it is based on an a priori assumption that ideas can be neatly compartmentalised and that their life span can be clearly delineated. In applying this to late Victorian and Edwardian Scotland there are no clear lines of demarcation in the history of ideas. There can be no precise moment when one social theory and its concomitant social action were supplanted by a different theory and a different action. Benthamism, laissez-faire, individualism, belief in God and the cult of ‘self-help’ and the moral quality of poverty were not simply replaced at one precise moment by collectivism, Social Darwinism, atheism/agnosticism and the acceptance of a paternalistic state in providing the essentials of life and promoting social justice. Instead there was a gradual development where different ideologies competed for supremacy as the ‘definitive’ tools for shaping social policy and for understanding the human condition and the nature of society. From the 1880s onwards social thought and social action began to change in reaction to what was perceived as a national social crisis. It was a crisis borne out of a cyclical process of economic depression set against the background of Britain's relative economic decline in comparison to competitors such as the United States of America and Germany. Faced with the challenges of falling prices, tighter profit margins and greater competition, employers reacted by rationalising their labour requirements through mechanisation and an increasing reliance upon unskilled casual and sweated labour at the expense of the traditional craft workers. This, however, was not the only cause of the crisis. The agricultural depression in the 1870s led to a huge demographic shift in the population with mass migration from rural Scotland to urban Scotland. Furthermore, Irish immigrants in their tens of thousands flooded into the cities, particularly Glasgow. The Highland Scots and the Irish came to the cities largely as casual unskilled labour with little or no job security to compete in the existing labour market depressing wages and thereby enabling their employers to exploit them. In reaction to this, organised labour began to assert itself through increasing unionisation and industrial militancy. Socialism began to gain currency and challenged the traditional class relationships in British society. Such fundamental social and economic changes inevitably led to a re-evaluation of poverty, the causes of the poverty, the relationship between the social classes and the threats to the status quo and the propertied classes that were posed by the burgeoning urban working class and the ‘residuum’. During the 1880s contemporary opinion began to recognise that these new city dwellers were prey to the powers of economic forces that were beyond their control. For example, the terms ‘unemployed’ and ‘unemployment’ started to gain currency as concepts that did not stigmatize the poor or attribute the causes of their condition to their own moral weaknesses. Unemployment and poverty began to be viewed not so much in Benthamite terms as an individual self-inflicted and morally questionable condition but the product of impersonal economic forces. Along with the population explosion in the cities came a housing crisis. Casual employment demanded that individuals should live within walking distance of the sources of their work. In many cases, this meant living and working in the traditional centres of the cities. Notwithstanding the fact that many Victorian cities were expanding far beyond their traditional boundaries through suburban development, made possible by the growth of the railways, the corresponding flight to the suburbs was very much a facet of the expanding middle classes in the 1880s. By contrast, the inner city areas were turned into chronically overcrowded centres of insanitary housing unable to cope with the huge influx of people. In attempting to solve the housing crisis the late Victorians and Edwardians were not simply engaged in a programme of improving the living conditions of those who lived in the slums, in fact the very poorest classes of slum dwellers were neither consulted nor substantially benefitted from the programmes of slum clearance and re-development. Programmes of slum clearance were principally concerned with the effects of the poor living conditions on the moral, physical, social and economic well-being of society. The late Victorians and Edwardians believed that lifestyles and living conditions were linked and they feared that the respectable poor would be contaminated by their close proximity to the residuum in the slums. The slums were believed to breed disease, crime, intemperance and immorality, external costs borne by wider society rather than the landlords and tenants of these properties. Writing about the moral evils of London's ‘rookeries’ in the 1880s, Andrew Mearns (who was widely read by the Scottish middle classes) observed: \\"Few who will read these pages have any conception of what these pestilential human rookeries are, where tens of thousands are crowded together amidst horrors which call to mind what we have heard of the middle passage of the slave ship... “Marriage”, it has been said, “as an institution, is not fashionable in these districts”... Ask if a man and woman living together in these rookeries are married, and your simplicity will cause a smile. Nobody knows, nobody cares. Nobody expects that they are... Incest is common; and no form of vice and sensuality causes surprises or attracts attention... Entire courts are filled with thieves, prostitutes and liberated convicts.\\"Andrew Mearns The Bitter Cry of Outcast London (London; London Congregational Union 1883) pp3-4 Mearns did much to prick middle class social conscience galvanising them into taking social action against the evils of slum life. In this context, Hay should be understood as approaching the housing crisis from the perspective of public health advocating the provision of improved housing in a manner that was consistent with the leading public health and sociological debates of the age. Through his tireless efforts and scientifically based reports Hay was able to persuade the Town Council to depart from its traditional, individualist, laissez faire view of the causes poverty (consistent with the social theories of Thomas Chalmers and Malthus) and to adopt the principles of municipal socialism in producing a workable model for solving Aberdeen's working class housing crisis.

However, Shantamma pampers Eeshwar very much, and hence he doesn't want to leave the village. Murthy dies, and in order to fulfil his last wish, Eeshwar goes to the city to earn money on the advice of his friend Basha (Ali), who was a pickpocket. Eeshwar could not meet Basha. On the other hand, Kotaiah (Kota Srinivasa Rao) runs big land mafia in Hyderabad and is a bitter rival of Narsing Pahilwan (Pradeep Rawat). Saidulu (Subbaraju) is Narsing's brother. Once, Saidulu hacks Kotaiah and his assistant, when Eeshwar accidentally saves him. Eeshwar gets a job in a tea stall run by Chandranna (Chandra Mohan). He earns good money, purchases two gold bangles for his mother, and plans to leave the city. At this juncture, Narsing humiliates Eeshwar for saving Kotaiah and stamps his mother's gold bangles. Irked over this, Eeshwar kills Narsing and turns the biggest goon of the city. Meanwhile, Shantamma reaches Hyderabad as Eeshwar killed Narsing. Kotaiah wants Eeshwar to join him, but to no avail. Chandranna encourages Eeshwar, who is now Yogi, to stay back in the city to save the poor, who gets harassed by the goons. Yogi remains a terror for the goons. So, Kotaiah and Saidulu join hands and hatch a plan to kill Yogi. While trying to carry it out, Yogi kills Saidulu. Nandini (Nayantara) is also after Yogi for an interview to complete her practicals. Somehow, she falls in love with him. Though Yogi and Shantamma live in the same city, they could not meet each other. One day, Yogi meets Basha, who reveals he saw Shantamma. Though Basha and Santamma go to the address, they could not find Eeshwar because he is known as Yogi for the people. Shantamma waits for her son in front of a temple, as Basha tells her that Yogi is in the habit of visiting the temple every Monday. But Eeshwar did not turn up on Monday, fearing attack by Saidulu's people. Shantamma dies in front of the temple, and Basha arranges the funeral for her. At this time, Yogi comes but fails to have a look at the covered face and helps the orphan body lifters with money for cremation. He puts flowers on his mother's body, though he is unaware that the body is his mother's until it is moved to the fire cabin. Basha finally arrives and explains the trauma, but it is too late. Yogi realizes the truth only after Nandini shows the belongings of his mother, who came to see him. The film ends with this emotional scene.

Located on the Southwest Waterfront of Washington, D.C., just under the shadow of Interstate 395, the Maine Avenue Fish Market stands as a cultural relic popular with locals but unknown to many of the tourists who flock to the monuments and museums just five blocks north. There are over ten stores, each with a specialty. The Maine Avenue Fish Market is open each day of the week, but the largest selection of fish is on display Friday evening through Sunday. A multitude of fresh seafood is sold on floating barges that line the pier along Water Street. These barges, which rise and fall with the tide, are a tribute to an old tradition dating back to the Civil War. For years, fishmongers would navigate theirs once a week down the Potomac to the Chesapeake. There, they would purchase seafood from the watermen and head back to the Washington, DC wharf.

However, the Market is somewhat isolated from the Mall due to its location under the freeway, and the city has refrained from promoting it as an attraction due to uncertainty about whether it can be preserved as an outdoor floating market. =21st Century Redevelopment= As late as 2009, plans were underway to once again redevelop the entire length of Maine Avenue and remove the frontage road of Water Street, on which the existing waterfront buildings and wharf are located. It is unclear what will be the impact on the historic market, or whether it will be wholly preserved, but all of the associated support structures on Water Street, including the sole remaining land-based eatery, were scheduled to be razed ”to keep the Fish Market in safe and operable condition until the redevelopment occurs”. According to a website associated with the developer PN Hoffman, \\"Washington’s historic Fish Market will be preserved and renovated and the maritime heritage of the site promoted.\\"Washington D.C. Economic Partnership, \\"Retail Opportunities\\". Retrieved 9/07/2009. The District Wharf complex opened with Phase I in October 2017, including residential space, hotels, live music venues, shops and restaurants, many overlooking the redesigned wharves and marina. Water Street SW has also been converted to pedestrian use. Phase II of the redevelopment will take place mid-2018 with an expected completion date of 2022.https://www.wharfdc.com/wharf/construction-timeline/ In popular culture * The Maine Avenue Fish Market is featured in the 2009 film, State of Play.Eating Crab Balls with Russell Crowe \\"Serious Eats\\".

Developed by a consortium of four companies – The POW-R Consortium – the algorithms were first made available in 1999 in digital audio hardware products. POW-R is now licensed for use by many companies, particularly those in the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) arena, where it currently has significant market share. History POW-R was developed between 1997 and 1998 after an unfavorable change in the licensing terms of a leading bit-depth reduction algorithm of the time prompted some of its licensees to put together a consortium to develop a viable alternative algorithm. Formed by four audio engineering companies: Lake Technology (Dolby Labs), Weiss Engineering, Millennia Media and Z-Systems, the consortium set out with the goal to create ‘the most sonically transparent dithering algorithm possible’. In 1999, the first products containing POW-R were released by consortium companies. Other companies became interested in using POW-R in their products, and the algorithms are now licensed to a number of leading DAW vendors including Apple Computer, Avid-Digidesign, Sonic Studio, Cakewalk Sonar,Review of Sonar 4 Merging Technologies, Merging Technologies press release Ableton,Ableton ‘What’s new’ Magix / Sequoia / Samplitude, and others. Reception One of the first products to include POW-R was a hardware dithering unit from Weiss engineering; in a review of this product in 1999, mastering engineer Bob Katz spoke highly of the new algorithm declaring it ‘an incredible achievement’. Technical details Technically, the entire POW-R suite is not noise shaping; rather, the original POW-R algorithm is based on narrow-band Nyquist dither, while other POW-R algorithms include noise shaping and white noise.Manufacturer's POW-R Data Sheet Unlike noise- shaping algorithms based on an ‘Absolute threshold of hearing’ model (i.e. the quietest sound that can be heard on otherwise silent conditions), POW-R has been designed to give optimal performance at normal listening levels. Here, optimal performance means maximizing the apparent dynamic range of the resultant signal while simultaneously minimizing the audible effects of the dither and quantization noise which, if this is not achieved, are typically tonal in nature. Since noise audibility depends on the nature of the audio being processed, the POW-R algorithm is made available in three variants, optimized respectively for simple program such as spoken word, limited dynamic range program such as rock music, and wide dynamic range program such as orchestral music. Each algorithm moves the noise to those frequencies where its audible effect for the particular audio type is minimized. The graph to the right shows the frequency response of the orchestral music algorithm variant (POW-R3, a 9th order filter).

Organozinc chemistry is the science of organozinc compounds describing their physical properties, synthesis and reactions.The Chemistry of Organozinc Compounds (Patai Series: The Chemistry of Functional Groups), (Eds. Z. Rappoport and I. Marek), John Wiley & Sons: Chichester, UK, 2006, .Organozinc reagents – A Practical Approach, (Eds. P. Knochel and P. Jones), Oxford Medical Publications, Oxford, 1999, .Synthetic Methods of Organometallic and Inorganic Chemistry Vol 5, Copper, Silver, Gold, Zinc, Cadmium, and Mercury, W.A. Herrmann Ed., Organozinc compounds were among the first organometallic compounds made. They are less reactive than many other analogous organometallic reagents, such as Grignard and organolithium reagents. In 1848 Edward Frankland prepared the first organozinc compound, diethylzinc, by heating ethyl iodide in the presence of zinc metal.E. Frankland, Liebigs Ann. Chem.,1849, 71, 171 This reaction produced a volatile colorless liquid that spontaneous combusted upon contact with air. Due to their pyrophoric nature, organozinc compounds are generally prepared using air-free techniques. They are unstable toward protic solvents. For many purposes they are prepared in situ, not isolated, but many have been isolated as pure substances and thoroughly characterized.Elschenbroich, C. ”Organometallics” (2006) Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. Organozincs can be categorized according to the number of carbon substituents that are bound to the metal. # Diorganozinc (R2Zn): A class of organozinc compounds in which two alkyl ligands. These may be further divided into subclasses depending on the other ligands attached # Heteroleptic (RZnX): Compounds which an electronegative or monoanionic ligand (X), such as a halide, is attached to the zinc center with another alkyl or aryl substituent (R). # Ionic organozinc compounds: This class is divided into organozincates (RnZn−) and organozinc cations (RZnLn+). Bonding In its coordination complexes zinc(II) adopts several coordination geometries, commonly octahedral, tetrahedral, and various pentacoordinate geometries. These structural flexibility can be attributed to zinc's electronic configuration [Ar]3d104s2. The 3d orbital is filled, and therefore, ligand field effects are nonexistent. Coordination geometry is thus determined largely by electrostatic and steric interactions. Organozinc compounds usually are two- or three-coordinate, reflecting the strongly donating property of the carbanionic ligands. Typical diorganozinc complexes have the formula R2Zn. Dialkylzinc compounds are monomeric with a linear coordination at the zinc atom. A polar covalent bond exists between carbon and zinc, being polarized toward carbon due to the differences in electronegativity values (carbon: 2.5 & zinc: 1.65). The dipole moment of symmetric diorganozinc reagents can be seen as zero in these linear complexes, which explains their solubility in nonpolar solvents like cyclohexane. Unlike other binary metal alkyls, the diorganozinc species show a low affinity for complexation with ethereal solvent. Bonding in R2Zn is described as employing sp-hybridized orbitals on Zn. These structures cause zinc to have two bonding d-orbitals and three low- lying non-bonding d-orbitals (see non-bonding orbital), which are available for binding. When zinc lacks electron donating ligands it is unable to obtain coordination saturation, which is a consequence of the large atomic radius and low electron deficiency of zinc. Therefore, it is rare for bridging alkyl or aryl groups to occur due to the weak electron deficiency of the zinc atom. Although, it does occur in some cases such as Ph2Zn (Shown below) and which halogens are the organozinc can form metal clusters (see cluster chemistry). When a halogen ligand is added to the zinc atom both the acceptor and donor character of zinc is enhanced allowing for aggregation. Saturated diorganozinc reagents with bridging aryl groups Synthesis Several methods exist for the generation of organozinc compounds. Commercially available diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc, diethylzinc and diphenylzinc. These reagents are expensive and difficult to handle. In one studyIn this one-pot reaction bromobenzene is converted to phenyllithium by reaction with 4 equivalents of n-butyllithium, then transmetalation with zinc chloride forms diphenylzinc which continues to react in an asymmetric reaction first with the MIB ligand and then with 2-naphthylaldehyde to the alcohol. In this reaction formation of diphenylzinc is accompanied by that of lithium chloride, which unchecked, catalyses the reaction without MIB involvement to the racemic alcohol. The salt is effectively removed by chelation with tetraethylethylene diamine (TEEDA) resulting in an enantiomeric excess of 92%. the active organozinc compound is obtained from much cheaper organobromine precursors: =From zinc metal= Frankland's original synthesis of diethylzinc involves the reaction of ethyl iodide with zinc metal. The zinc must be activated to facilitate this redox reaction. One of such activated form of zinc employed by Frankland is zinc-copper couple. Riecke zinc, produced by in situ reduction of ZnCl2 with potassium, is another activated form of zinc. This form has proven useful for reactions such as Negishi coupling and Fukuyama coupling. Formation of organozinc reagents is facilitated for alkyl or aryl halides bearing electron- withdrawing substituents, e.g., nitriles and esters. {{NumBlk: \\\\ce{{ZnCl2} + 2K ->[\\\\ce{THF}][\\\\ce{-2KCl}]} \\\\overbrace\\\\ce{Zn^0}^\\\\ce{Riecke\\\\ zinc} + \\\\ce{R-X ->[\\\\ce{THF}][20-60^\\\\circ\\\\ce C] R-Zn-I} \\\\qquad \\\\begin{cases} \\\\mathbf{R}: &\\\\text{Allyl, Aryl, Akyl, Benzyl}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{X}: &\\\\text{Bromide, Iodide} \\\\end{cases} }} =Functional group exchange= The two most common zinc functional group interconversion reactions are with halides and boron, which is catalyzed by copper iodide (CuI) or base. The boron intermediate is synthesized by an initial hydroboration reaction followed by treatment with diethyl zinc. This synthesis shows the utility of organozinc reagents by displaying high selectivity for the most reactive site in the molecule, as well as creating useful coupling partners. This group transfer reaction can be used in allylation, or other coupling reactions (such as Negishi coupling).Naka,H; et al.New J. Chem., 2010, 34, 1700–1706 =β-Silyl diorganozinc compounds= One of the major drawbacks of diorganozinc alkylations is that only one of the two alkyl substituents is transferred. This problem can be solved by using Me3SiCH2 (TMSM), which is a non- transferable group.Knochel,P.; et al. Angel. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1997, volume 36, 1496-1498 {{NumBlk: \\\\begin{array}{l} {}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ce{{R2Zn} + (TMSM)2Zn}\\\\ \\\\overset\\\\ce{THF}\\\\ce{<=>>} \\\\ \\\\ce{2R(TMSM)Zn}\\\\\\\\\\\\ {}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ce{{RZnI} + (TMSM)Li ->[\\\\ce{THF}][-80^\\\\circ\\\\\\\\!\\\\ce C] {R(TMSM)Zn} + LiI}\\\\\\\\\\\\ {} \\\\end{array} }} =Transmetallation= Transmetallation is similar to the interconversions displayed above zinc can exchange with other metals such as mercury, lithium, copper, etc. One example of this reaction is the reaction of diphenylmercury with zinc metal to form diphenylzinc and metallic mercury: The benefit of transmetalling to zinc it is often more tolerant of other functional groups in the molecule due to the low reactivity which increases selectivity. *In the synthesis of Maoecrystal V, a directed ortho metalation gives the initial aryl-lithium species, which is transmetallated to the desired arylzinc compound. The arylzinc compound is significantly less reactive than the aryl- lithium species and thus better tolerates the functionality in the subsequent coupling with methyl chlorooxaloacetate. Esters are significantly stable against organozinc reagents. Organozinc can be obtained directly from zinc metal:In this example the arylzinc iodide continues to react with allyl bromide in a nucleophilic displacement :In this method zinc is activated by 1,2-dibromoethane and trimethylsilyl chloride. A key ingredient is lithium chloride which quickly forms a soluble adduct with the organozinc compound thus removing it from the metal surface. Reactions In many of their reactions organozincs appear as intermediates. * In the Frankland–Duppa reaction (1863) an oxalate ester (ROCOCOOR) reacts with an alkyl halide R'X, zinc and hydrochloric acid to the α-hydroxycarboxylic esters RR'COHCOOR =Reformatsky reaction= This organic reaction can be employed to convert α-haloester and ketone or aldehyde to a β-hydroxyester. Acid is needed to protonate the resulting alkoxide during work up. The initial step is an oxidative addition of zinc metal into the carbon-halogen bond, thus forming a carbon-zinc enolate. This C-Zn enolate can then rearrange to the Oxygen-Zinc enolate via coordination. Once this is formed the other carbonyl containing starting material will coordinate in the manner shown below and give the product after protonation.) The benefits of the Reformatsky reaction over the conventional aldol reaction protocols is the following: # Allows for exceedingly derivatized ketone substrates # The ester enolate intermediate can be formed in the presence of enolizable moieties # Well suited for intramolecular reactions Below shows the six-membered transition state of the Zimmerman–Traxler model (Chelation Control, see Aldol reaction), in which R3 is smaller than R4.Kurti, L.; Czako, B. ‘‘Strategic Applications of Named Reactions in Organic Synthesis’’; Elsevier: Burlington, 2005. The Reformatsky reaction has been employed in numerous total syntheses such as the synthesis of C(16),C(18)-bis-epi-cytochalasin D: The Reformatsky reaction even allows for with zinc homo-enolates.Kumwaijima,I.; et al. J. Am. Chem. 1987, 109, 8056 A modification of the Reformatsky reaction is the Blaise reaction. =Simmons–Smith reaction= The Simmons–Smith reagent is used to prepare cyclopropanes from olefin using methylene iodide as the methylene source. The reaction is effected with zinc. The key zinc-intermediate formed is a carbenoid (iodomethyl)zinc iodide which reacts with alkenes to afford the cyclopropanated product. The rate of forming the active zinc species is increased via ultrasonication since the initial reaction occurs at the surface of the metal. \\\\+ 2\\\\, {\\\\color{Blue}\\\\ce{Zn}} \\\\ \\\\ce{-> 2}\\\\, {\\\\color{Red}\\\\ce{ICH2}}{\\\\color{Blue}\\\\ce{ZnI}} \\\\ \\\\ce{<=>}\\\\ {\\\\color{Red}\\\\ce{(ICH2)2}}{\\\\color{Blue}\\\\ce{Zn}} + {\\\\color{Blue}\\\\ce{Zn}}{\\\\color{Red}\\\\ce{I2}} }} Although the mechanism has not been fully elaborated it is hypothesized that the organozinc intermediate is a metal-carbenoid. The intermediate is believed to be a three-centered \\"butterfly-type\\". This intermediate can be directed by substituents, such as alcohols, to deliver the cyclopropane on the same side of the molecule. Zinc- copper couple is commonly used to activate zinc. =Titanium–zinc methylenation= Organozinc compounds derived from methylene bromide or iodide can electrophilically add to carbonyl groups to form terminal alkenes. The reaction is mechanistically related to the Tebbe reaction and can be catalyzed by various Lewis acids (e.g. TiCl4 or Al2Me6). The reaction is used to introduce deuterium into molecules for isotopic labeling or as an alternative to the Wittig reaction. =Negishi coupling= This powerful carbon-carbon bond forming cross-coupling reactions combines an organic halide and an organozinc halide reagent in the presence of a nickel or palladium catalyst. The organic halide reactant can be alkenyl, aryl, allyl, or propargyl. Alkylzinc coupling with alkyl halides such as bromides and chlorides have also been reported with active catalysts such as Pd-PEPPSI precatalysts, which strongly resist beta-hydride elimination (a common occurrence with alkyl substituents).S. Sase, M. Jaric, A. Metzger, V. Malakhov, P. Knochel, J. Org. Chem., 2008, 73, 7380-7382 Either diorganic species or organozinc halides can be used as coupling partners during the transmetallation step in this reaction. Despite the low reactivity of organozinc reagents on organic electrophiles, these reagents are among the most powerful metal nucleophiles toward palladium.) Alkylzinc species require the presence of at least a stoichiometric amount of halide ions in solution to form a \\"zincate\\" species of the form RZnX32−, before it can undergo transmetalation to the palladium centre. This behavior contrasts greatly with the case of aryl zinc species. A key step in the catalytic cycle is a transmetalation in which a zinc halide exchanges its organic substituent for another halogen with the metal center. An elegant example of Negishi coupling is Furstner's synthesis of amphidinolide T1: =Fukuyama coupling= Fukuyama coupling is a palladium- catalyzed reaction involving the coupling of an aryl, alkyl, allyl, or α,β- unsaturated thioester compound. This thioester compound can be coupled to a wide range of organozinc reagents in order to reveal the corresponding ketone product. This protocol is useful due to its sensitivity to functional groups such as ketone, acetate, aromatic halides, and even aldehydes. The chemoselectivity observed indicates ketone formation is more facile than oxidative addition of palladium into these other moieties. A further example of this coupling method is the synthesis of (+)-biotin. In this case, the Fukuyama coupling takes place with the thiolactone: =Barbier reaction= The Barbier reaction involves nucleophilic addition of a carbanion equivalent to a carbonyl. The conversion is similar to the Grignard reaction. The organozinc reagent is generated via an oxidative addition into the alkyl halide. The reaction produces a primary, secondary, or tertiary alcohol via a 1,2-addition. The Barbier reaction is advantageous because it is a one-pot process: the organozinc reagent is generated in the presence of the carbonyl substrate. Organozinc reagents are also less water sensitive, thus this reaction can be conducted in water. Similar to the Grignard reaction, a Schlenk equilibrium applies, in which the more reactive dialkylzinc can be formed. The mechanism resembles the Grignard reaction, in which the metal alkoxide can be generated by a radical stepwise pathway, through single electron transfer, or concerted reaction pathway via a cyclic transition state. An example of this reaction is in Danishefsky’s synthesis of cycloproparadicicol. By using the organozinc addition reaction conditions the other functionality of the dienone and the alkyne are tolerated: =Zinc acetylides= The formation of the zinc acetylide proceeds via the intermediacy of a dialkynyl zinc (functional group exchange). Catalytic processes have been developed such as Merck’s ephedrine process.Li, Z.; Upadhyay, V.; DeCamp, A. E.; DiMichele, L.; Reider, P. J. Synthesis 1999, 1453-1458. Propargylic alcohols can be synthesized from zinc acetylides. These versatile intermediates can then be used for a wide range of chemical transformations such as cross-coupling reactions, hydrogenation, and pericyclic reactions. In the absence of ligands, the reaction is slow and inefficient. In the presence of chiral ligands, the reaction is fast and gives high conversion. Noyori determined that a monozinc-ligand complex is the active species. Diastereoselectivity for addition of organozinc reagents into aldehydes can be predicted by the following model by Noyori and David A. Evans: *The α-stereocenter of the ligand dictates observed stereochemistry of the propargylic alcohols *The steric effects between the aldehyde substituent and the ligand are less important but still dictate the favored conformation Zinc-acetylides are used in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor Efavirenz as well as in Merck’s ephedrine derivatives .Thompson, A. S.; Corley, E. G.; Huntington, M. F.; Grabowski, E. J. J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995, 36, 8937-8940 Organozincates The first organozinc ate complex (organozincate) was reported in 1858 by James Alfred Wanklyn, an assistant to Frankland and concerned the reaction of elemental sodium with diethylzinc: Organozinc compounds that are strongly Lewis acidic are vulnerable to nucleophilic attack by alkali metals, such as sodium, and thus form these ‘ate compounds’. Two types of organozincates are recognized: tetraorganozincates ([R4Zn]M2), which are dianionic, and triorganozincates ([R3Zn]M), which are monoanionic. Their structures, which are determined by the ligands, have been extensively characterized. =Synthesis= Tetraorganozincates such as [Me4Zn]Li2 can be formed by mixing Me2Zn and MeLi in a 1:2 molar ratio of the rectants. Another example synthetic route to forming spriocyclic organozincates is shown below: Triorganozincates compounds are formed by treating a diorganozinc such as (Me3SiCH2)2Zn with an alkali metal (K), or an alkali earth metal (Ba, Sr, or Ca). One example is [(Me3SiCH2)3Zn]K. Triethylzincate degrades to sodium hydridoethylzincate(II) as a result of beta-hydride elimination: The product is an edge-shared bitetrahedral structure, with bridging hydride ligands. =Reactions= Although less commonly studied, organozincates often have increased reactivity and selectivity compared to the neutral diorganozinc compounds. They have been useful in stereoselective alkylations of ketones and related carbonyls, ring opening reactions. Aryltrimethylzincates participate in vanadium mediated C-C forming reactions. Organozinc(I) compounds Low valent organozinc compounds having a Zn–Zn bond are also known. The first such compound, decamethyldizincocene, was reported in 2004.

From inception until early 2018, the service was provided by Acxsys, a for-profit consortium backed by most of the major partners of the nonprofit Interac Association, and using the Interac brand under licence. In February 2018, the activities of both organizations were combined into a single for-profit organization under the Interac name.  Participating institutions  Most Canadians who use online banking can send funds. These include personal deposit account holders with the big five banks, Desjardins, Tangerine, National Bank, President's Choice Financial, and many credit unions and other institutions,Interac e-Transfer participants as well as some small- business account holders. In 2015, 105 million money transfers were sent using the platform totaling over 44 billion in value. Any personal account holder in Canada can receive funds.  How it works  An e-Transfer resembles an e-check in many respects. The money is not actually transferred by e-mail. Only the instructions to retrieve the funds are. * The sender opens an online banking session and chooses the recipient, the amount to send, as well as a security question and answer. The funds are debited instantly, usually for a surcharge. The sender sends the security answer separately to the recipient, usually through another medium outside of the e-mail as a secondary security measure. * An e-mail or text message is then sent to the recipient, with instructions on how to retrieve the funds and answer the question, via a secure website. * The recipient must answer the security question correctly. (If the recipient fails to answer the question correctly after three tries, then the funds will automatically be returned to sender.) ** If the recipient is subscribed to online banking at one of the participating institutions, the funds are deposited instantly at no extra charge. ** If the recipient's deposit account is not at one of the participating institutions or not subscribed to online banking at all, the funds are deposited within three to five business days, and a surcharge (currently $4.00) is deducted from the amount received. * The Autodeposit feature allows senders to send money and be received by the recipient without the recipient having to answer a security question. The recipient must enable this feature in their account settings. Not all banks offer this feature. * When an eTransfer has not been accepted after a certain period of time the transfer will not go through. The transfer duration depends on bank and/or on the persons settings. Some eTransfers can be automatically canceled after 24 hours or for a period of up to 30 days depending on bank/user. Banks like TD, CIBC and RBC have a set 30 day limit until an eTransfer is cancelled, while other banks have shorter durations and set limits.  Benefits and disadvantages  Unlike a cheque, the funds from an e-Transfer are not frozen in the recipient's account. An e-Transfer cannot bounce, as the funds are guaranteed, having been debited from the sender's account immediately upon initiating the transfer. As long as both sender and recipient bank are participating institutions, the funds are sent and received instantly. However in some cases, for example two people with different banking institutions, transfers may take anywhere between near instant, or up to a few hours for the receiving party to get their emailed notice. However, like any online banking mode of payment, e-Transfers are vulnerable to phishing. Many Canadians in areas where the Big Five banks have little presence or who do not bank online are penalized by a surcharge when receiving e-Transfers. Unlike a real giro, an e-Transfer requires intervention from the recipient for every single transaction unless the recipient has signed up for Autodeposit. An e-Transfer goes stale much faster than a cheque (after 30 days, the e-Transfer is automatically cancelled and the sender is notified by e-mail to retrieve the funds).Interac  Security and privacy issues  In 2019 several articles published by Erica Johnson (CBC news) reported that e-Transfers had been intercepted and/or redirected via different means such as guessing security questions or impersonating e-Transfer customers. In many cases, the customers were not reimbursed. In the same year a paper published on arxiv.org examined the security and privacy of Interac e-Transfer and came to the conclusion that \\"Standard e-Transfers are potentially insecure against redirections\\" and that \\"the platform fails to protect its customers’ privacy\\" due to relying on technologies such as e-mail and SMS.

It was created out of several dozen smaller units of self- defence forces composed of local volunteers in what is now Lithuania and Belarus, amidst a growing series of territorial disputes between the Second Polish Republic, the Russian SFSR, and several other local provisional governments. The Division took part in several key battles of the war.  History  The Battle of Warsaw, the most important battle of the war, was one of the battles the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Infantry Division took part in. With the end of the World War I in the West, a growing series of territorial disputes between Poland, Soviet Russia and several other local provisional governments erupted in a series of wars in Central and Eastern Europe, the most prominent of these being the Polish–Soviet War. Starting in the last years of the First World War, many smaller units of self-defence forces were created out of local volunteers in those areas, among them likely the best known being the Lithuanian and Belarusian Self-Defence ('Samoobrona Litwy i Białorusi'). Self-Defence units were organized in the areas of the Kresy region with Polish majorities or significant minorities – usually urbanized areas like the cities of Vilnius, Minsk, Hrodna, Lida and Kaunas, or towns like Ašmiany, Wilejka, Nemenčinė, Świr and Panevėžys; until December 1918 those units had no central command or organization and many of them were named after the local cities or regions (like 'Samoobrona Lidy'). The first task of those units was curbing the crime wave by German deserters, and later, defence from the pro-Bolshevik groups. Despite its name, most of the members of that organization were either Poles or polonized, and therefore supported the cause of attaching those territories with the newly recreated Polish state.Grzegorz Łukowski, and Rafal E. Stolarski, Walka o Wilno. Z dziejow Samoobrony Litwy i Bialorusi, 1918-1919 (Fight for Wilno. From the history of the Self-Defence of Lithuania and Belarus, 1918-1919), Adiutor, 1994, = Operational history = The initial core of the division was formed in December 1918 in Minsk, where a group of roughly 1,500 Poles and Belarusians rose to arms to defend the city against the advancing forces of Soviet Russia. In June 1919, the Bolsheviks deployed the Jewish First Guard Battalion from Minsk (at the insistence of its own members) against the Polish Army which included the First and the Second Lithuanian–Belarusian Divisions. Also in: The pro-communist Jews had won the first skirmish, forcing the Poles and Belorussians to retreat several kilometers. On August 8, 1919, Polish troops recaptured Minsk from the Bolsheviks. The main attack was in the direction of Maladzechna, Minsk, and Polatsk along the railroad lines. ---- English ed. (2011) Random House, , pp. 59, 70. Google Books. However, due to Russian numerical superiority and lack of support from the side of the short-lived Belarusian People's Republic, the group withdrew towards central Poland. Other such self-defence groups, resistance organizations, and veterans of the Green Army of the Russian Civil War also reached Poland, where they were reformed into a single unit under the command of general Władysław Wejtko formerly from the Imperial Russian Army. Battle of Niemen. Another large group of volunteers to join the division were the remnants of roughly 2,500 men strong force created in Vilnius to defend it against the Reds in January 1919. In the effect of four-day-long fights for the city and the area of Nowa Wilejka, the Polish forces were pushed back and the city had to be abandoned. The newly formed division took part in the Battle of Brześć Litewski of January 8 of that year, one of the first battles of the Polish–Soviet War. The division, commanded by Gen. Jan Rządkowski, took part in many of the largest battles of that conflict. Among others, it played a major role in the Battle of Radzymin, a part of the Battle of Warsaw, the decisive struggle of the war. It also took part in the Battle of the Niemen, where it suffered heavy losses. Finally, two days prior to the cease-fire ending the war, the units of the division – then commanded by Gen. Lucjan Żeligowski – took over Vilnius Region from the Lithuanian forces and formed the core of the armed forces of the Republic of Central Lithuania. Following the elections held in Wilno and the state merger with Poland in 1923, the division was partially demobilized, while its remnants were incorporated into the Polish 19th Infantry Division stationed in Wilno. 2nd Lithuanian–Belarusian Division Parts of the 1st Lithuanian–Belarusian Division (1.DL-B) were transferred, in July 1919, to form the parallel 2nd Lithuanian–Belarusian Division (, 2.DL-B) of the Polish Army. The division suffered heavy casualties during the Soviet invasion in summer 1920; some soldiers were forced to retreat into Lithuanian territory where they were interned by the Bolsheviks. The division was soon reinforced and renamed as the 20th Infantry Division. It temporarily returned to the old name of the 2nd Division after Żeligowski's Mutiny, when it became part of the Republic of Central Lithuania military.

Arthur J. Rooney Athletic Field, commonly known as simply Rooney Field, is a 2,200-seat (4,500 capacity) multi- purpose facility in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Situated on the campus of Duquesne University, Rooney Field is the home field of the Duquesne Dukes football, soccer and lacrosse teams. Its location atop the Bluff in the center of Duquesne's campus makes Rooney Field one of the most unusual football facilities in the nation. Bordered by Academic Walk on one side and Mellon Hall of Science and the Duquesne Towers Living and Learning Center on either end, the field offers scenic views of downtown Pittsburgh, the Monongahela River, and Pittsburgh's South Side. Rooney Field has enjoyed the national spotlight as the host of three televised games. On Monday, October 31, 1994, ESPN2 televised Duquesne's 16–12 win over Iona College to a national audience. In addition, two games in 1995 — the MAAC Championship-deciding game versus St. John's and the ECAC Bowl game vs. Wagner — were aired locally on what was then the e Sports Network. Description The 1993 completion of Rooney Field enabled the Dukes to play football on campus for the first time since 1929. A excavation transformed what was once a faculty and staff parking lot into the centerpiece of Duquesne University's urban campus. The space limitations inherent to the university's plot required that Rooney Field be one of the few in college football that run east to west. The Beard Press Box, a three-tier structure funded by a contribution from the Eugene Beard family, was completed in the summer of 1995. The field itself is named for Duquesne alumnus and founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Art Rooney. Prior to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Sportsplex opening in 2000, the field and other university facilities served as either the primary or secondary in-season training facilities for the Steelers since their founding in 1933. In addition to serving as home for the Duquesne men's and women's soccer and lacrosse teams, numerous other activities are held on Rooney Field. Various camps, team practices, and intramural activities keep the field in constant use. With a capacity of only 2,200 fans, Rooney Field is currently the smallest stadium in the NCAA FCS. Renovations Bolstered by the first half of a $4 million renovation completed in 2009, the lighted, Sportexe turf-covered facility celebrates its 20th full-season anniversary in 2013. Part of the recently completed renovation is permanent grandstand seating on Bluff Street, which replaces temporary bleachers that had been installed for 14 football seasons. Permanent concession stands and restrooms have also been added to the south side of the field. The Academic Walk sideline has also gained additional seating. As part of the second stage of the renovation, the field house located at the east end of the field was remodeled and expanded to provide an area for a new football locker room, football coaches' suite, and additional locker room space for the soccer, lacrosse, and swim teams. Field house construction began following the 2008–2009 athletics season and was finished in the summer of 2011. The 2009 renovation reduced the field's capacity from 4,500 to the current 2,200 although plans are being developed for a future renovation that may re-add additional seating.

It was developed by Francis Irving and Julian Todd following the 18 March 2003 Parliamentary Approval for the invasion of Iraq as a tool to record which MPs had defied their party's whip long after the information had become effectively inaccessible for reference. On 1 August 2011 Irving and Todd handed control of the site to a new team. The project is loosely affiliated to mySociety's TheyWorkForYou with which it shares a large part of the same parliamentary parsing code-base. In 2014 the OpenAustralia Foundation launched a fork of the project for Australia's federal parliament called They Vote For You . Awards and funding In 2004 the Public Whip won the New Statesman New Media Award for \\"civic renewal\\". The site has never received a grant from any funding body and remains entirely paid for by its creators, including server costs and bandwidth. Technology Originally the software was written in Perl, and then later rewritten in Python. The main process downloads the daily transcripts from the online Hansard, matches and assigns IDs to the names of MPs, and saves them into XML files. These are later uploaded into a mySQL table and viewed through PHP webpages. At the end of 2003 the project was extended to read the archive of Parliamentary Written Answers. Following a request from mySociety, the Parliamentary Parser was expanded to include House of Commons and Westminster Hall debates, and finally the House of Lords, which are all more or less in the same format. It is now maintained by them to provide the data to their TheyWorkForYou website. Publicity The website has occasionally been cited in newspaper articles, and is sometimes referred to in election material. It has also been used to provide voting analysis to citizens during elections. Activism An election quiz which advised voters of which party or incumbent candidate most closely matched their political opinions (according to the Parliamentary vote) was on the site for the 2005 General election and received over 10,000 hits. In anticipation of preparing a version of it again for the next general election, Julian has distributed leaflets and tried out variations of the site at the 2008 Crewe and Nantwich by-election and the 2008 Glenrothes by-election. Creators Francis Irving currently does programming work for mySociety, most recently WhatDoTheyKnow, a site that provides an on-line interface to the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Julian Todd has extended the concept of parsing transcripts for speeches and votes to the General Assembly and Security Council of the United Nations with a website called undemocracy.com established in 2007. The work was motivated by the discovery of the transcripts on-line during research into the application of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267 in his home town of Liverpool.

The team was sponsored by the students themselves and it was these same students who rented temporary wooden stands, to be set around the gridiron, for the 1964 and 1965 seasons. The university stepped in to build permanent wooden stands behind the left field home run wall which served as a grandstand for football. A press box and scoreboard were added in 1967 and the university reinstated varsity football for the 1970 season. In 1990, and with Fordham football moving up to the I-AA ranks (now known as FCS), those wooden stands were torn down and replaced with aluminum bleachers . Bathrooms and concessions were added beneath the new set of bleachers while an elevator was added to the new press box.

Design Worthy of the City. Chapter 4, In: Cameron (2006). The station opened for traffic on the GPK&A; in August 1840; and for traffic on the GP&G; in March 1841. It was sited in Laurieston on the south side of the River Clyde, but was close to the centre of Glasgow. Clyde services terminus station The railway line between Paisley and Glasgow was built by the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway, with Joseph Locke and John Errington as joint engineers. The station layout was designed by James Miller. The line, together with Bridge Street station, was under the control of the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway Committee, which was jointly chaired by the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway and the Glasgow and South Western Railway. The opening of the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway took away a lot of the river traffic from Glasgow; instead the steam boats terminated at Greenock and the railway was used between Greenock and Glasgow. The railway journey was 1 hour against 2.5 to 3.5 hours for river traffic. Similarly the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway provided a quicker journey to the coast than the river journey.Thomas, John (1971). Chapter VII - The River Clyde and Loch Lomand. Some 21,890 people used the service during Glasgow Fair week in July 1841. It remained the Clyde services terminus of both the Caledonian Railway and the Glasgow and South Western Railway for nearly thirty years. Both railway companies wanted to cross the Clyde but were precluded from doing so by Glasgow Corporation, the Clyde Navigation Trustees, the Bridge Trustees; and finally by the Admiralty, who insisted on bridges with at least one lifting section. The Caledonian Railway's main line from London, via Carstairs, which opened to Edinburgh on 15 February 1848 and to Glasgow on 1 November 1849 remained on the north-side of the Clyde, at Buchanan Street, eventually moving to Glasgow Central Station (see below). Diversion of G&SWR; services The Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;) achieved the first river crossing, by means of the City of Glasgow Union Railway. The line left the Joint Railway near Shields Road (now Shields Junction) and continued through the Gorbals. It crossed the River Clyde at Hutchesontown to their new St Enoch railway station. The line and station opened on 1 May 1876; construction of the line having taken 11 years.MacIntosh, Jim. (2006). Glasgow and the Caledonian Railway. Chapter 2, In: Cameron (2006). In 1883, St Enoch railway station became the headquarters of the Glasgow and South Western Railway, and all services were diverted to St Enoch. Refurbishment by the Caledonian Railway The Caledonian Railway eventually built their new terminal station, Glasgow Central station, which opened in 1879 on the north-side of the River Clyde. Access to Glasgow Central station was gained via a four-track railway bridge, built by Sir William Arrol parallel to Glasgow Bridge. Central station initially had eight platforms. Bridge Street station was also refurbished in 1879. Two new through platforms on the east side provided access to Glasgow Central station.Johnston & Hume, pages 24-27 Bridge Street however remained the terminus, for the time being, for the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway; which had two dedicated bay platforms on the west side. The other two bay platforms on the west side were for G&SWR; use. Closures Between 1901 and 1905 Glasgow Central Station was refurbished and extended over the top of Argyle Street; and thirteen platforms were built. An additional eight-track bridge was built over the River Clyde; and the original four-track bridge was raised by 30 inch (0.76 m). Bridge Street station then closed as a terminal station and the platforms were removed. The area previously occupied by the four bay platforms was used as carriage sidings for Glasgow Central Station; and the area previously occupied by the through platforms was used as running lines to Central Station. The remaining Caledonian Railway Clyde Coast services were extended to Glasgow Central Station and the remaining G&SWR; services diverted to St Enoch station. A new signalling scheme for Glasgow Central in the 1900s led to the construction of a new power operated signal box. It was cantilevered off the eight-track bridge; sitting suspended between the two river bridges.Nelson, Robin (2006). Signal box with a view. Chapter 17 In: Cameron (2006). Signal installation commenced in October 1907; the west side was commissioned on 5 April 1908 and the remainder on 3 May 1908. Architecture The architect of the original two-storey station building, which opened in 1841, was James Collie.Johnston & Hume, pages 14-17 The booking hall, which fronted Bridge Street, had an elaborate Doric portico flanked by two projecting end pavilions. There was additional access directly to the station platforms from the side entrance facing the quayside at Clyde Place. The upper floors of the adjacent building at the corner of Bridge Street and Clyde Place housed the Bridge Street Station Hotel. After the opening of the new station, the booking hall was converted for use as offices. The portico was removed c.1950 and the remainder of the buildings were demolished in 1971. The site of the first Bridge Street Station was never redeveloped after the demolition of the station buildings and is now landscaped. The second Bridge Street Station was situated between Kingston Street and Nelson Street. The design and construction of the new station was carried out by the Caledonian Railway Company Architects and Engineers Department in 1889/1890,Dictionary of Scottish Architects web page under the supervision of engineer, George Graham. The main block, fronting Bridge Street, was designed by James MillerThe Buildings of Scotland, Glasgow, Penguin Books, 1990, pages 519-520 in early French Renaissance style. The massive four-storey and attic building was built with cream sandstone. There was an arched entrance to a central booking hall at street level and additional entrances leading directly to the platforms at each end of the building, at 40 and 52 Bridge Street. These side entrances are still in use as access to apartments following the redevelopment of the upper levels of the block for residential use in 1994. The station buildings are now protected as a category B listed building. References =Notes= =Sources=  * Nock O.S., (1963). The Caledonian Railway. London: Ian Allan Ltd.

It is home to the La Salle University Explorers men's and women's soccer teams. It was previously the home to the university's American football team until it was discontinued in 2007 after a seven-year revival. The facility opened in 1936. Its field is surrounded by a six lane, one-quarter mile track. History The original football field ran perpendicular to today's configuration, and the fifty yards of gridiron nearest the current scoreboard are essentially the result of a substantial landfill operation by Joseph M. Crowley during the mid-1930s. The above landfill involved several men and a horse to gradually level the countless truckloads of dirt, rocks, bricks, concrete, and asphalt (each load cost La Salle about twenty-five cents). The first collegiate football game held at the stadium occurred on 1 November 1936, in which La Salle defeated fellow Christian Brothers' college (St. Mary's of Minnesota), 47-12. The stadium was officially dedicated on 10 October 1937 with a parade consisting of a color guard, the college band, and the college ROTC unit. The stadium was just five years old when La Salle's last Varsity football game was played in November 1941. The sport was suspended indefinitely because World War II resulted in a dramatic decline in the enrollment of La Salle and virtually every Catholic men's college. La Salle's aggregate record during eleven years of gridiron competition (1931–1941) was 51-34-8, and several Explorers had been named to Little All-American status. The stadium continued to host high school football games, especially those involving La Salle College High School on Sunday afternoons, and recent LSCHS-Saint Joseph's Preparatory School Thanksgiving showdowns. During the Second World War, thirty or so German prisoners-of-war (housed in the nearby Pennsylvania National Guard Armory) were also periodically brought to the stadium for exercise, usually soccer. Starting in 1950, the building underneath the west stands was known as \\"McCarthy Hall\\", and was the location of ROTC classes for years. McCarthy Hall was damaged, and the press box was destroyed in a suspicious fire in March 1977. Underneath the east stands, a textbook store operated until the 1980s. La Salle's Mail and Printing services are currently located under the east stands. Over the 1988-1989 school year, McCarthy Stadium's cinder track was rubberized, and the track was named the Frank M. Wetzler Track in honor of a former La Salle Professor and track coach. In April 1997, a concert by the Indigo Girls in 1997 suffered an 11th-hour cancellation because of standing water from heavy rains earlier in the week. In August of that year, the U. S. Postal Service held its unveiling of the official Glenn Scobey \\"Pop\\" Warner postage stamp in ceremony at the stadium. In 2006, the grass field was razed and replaced with a Sprinturf artificial playing surface. In addition, lights were added. = Namesake = The stadium's namesake is John A. McCarthy (1872–1939) who graduated from Central High School and the University of Pennsylvania. He began a law career, but at the age of thirty-four he exchanged it for a future in finance when he was appointed as a counsel in the receivership of the old Real Estate Trust Co. McCarthy went on to become President of the Philadelphia Sugar Co. and also an officer or director of a dozen large firms. McCarthy donated $10,000 towards the construction of the stadium, and later led a fund- raising effort for La Salle's 75th Anniversary.http://goexplorers.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/lasa-m-footbl- mtt.html References College lacrosse venues in the United States College soccer venues in the United States Defunct college football venues La Salle Explorers football American football venues in Pennsylvania Lacrosse venues in the United States Sports venues in Philadelphia Multi-purpose stadiums in the United States Wister, Philadelphia High school football venues in the United States Soccer venues in Pennsylvania 1936 establishments in Pennsylvania Sports venues completed in 1936 ","title":"McCarthy Stadium"},{"id":"5722191","text":"Polish 19th Infantry Division was formed in 1923, from three regiments of the divisions that had previously formed armed forces of the Republic of Central Lithuania. Originally, it consisted of the following infantry regiments: * 85th Wilno Regiment (formerly part of the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division), * 86th Minsk Regiment (formerly part of the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division), * 77th Kowno Regiment (formerly part of the 2nd Lithuanian- Belarusian Division). During the interbellum period, the division was stationed in the city of Wilno, which in 1922–1939 was part of the Second Polish Republic. Until 1927, it was commanded by General Michal Tokarzewski- Karaszewicz, who was replaced by General Tadeusz Kasprzycki (1927–1931). For most of the 1930s, the division was commanded by General Eugeniusz Godziejewski, who in mid-April 1936 was replaced by its last interbellum commandant, General Jozef Kwaciszewski. The 19th I.D. fought in the September 1939 German Invasion of Poland, as part of the Prusy Army. Later it was recreated as a Home Army unit, taking part in the Operation Ostra Brama in the summer of 1944. The 19th I.D. under General Jozef Kwaciszewski belonged to northern group of Prusy Army, under General Stefan Dąb-Biernacki. On September 5, 1939, the division was sent to the area of Piotrków Trybunalski, where it faced the 1st Panzer Division of the Wehrmacht. Under German pressure, it had to withdraw on September 6, and on the same day, the Germans captured General Kwaciszewski. On September 7 in the evening, units of the division scattered, trying to break through German lines and escape eastwards, towards the Vistula. On September 8 Colonel Tadeusz Pelczynski began reconstruction of the division, with two infantry regiments (77th, 86th), and some artillery, which managed to cross the Vistula. Following the order of General Dab-Biernacki, its name was changed to the 19th Infantry Brigade. The unit took part in the Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski, capitulating on September 27. Reserve center of the division was stationed in Lida. On September 17, 1939, when news of the Soviet Invasion of Poland reached the town, an assault company of 150 men was formed in Lida, with the task of breaking through the advancing Red Army, and reaching Wilno. The plan was changed, and the company headed for Grodno, where it took place in the Battle of Grodno.

His mother was the grandniece of William Penn. His father was one of many lawyer Garlands in Albemarle County, but moved to Amherst County (from which Nelson County was divided) after the death of his father (another James Garland) in 1781. Hudson Garland represented Amherst County in the Virginia General Assembly for one term (December 3, 1804 – February 1, 1805) and served as a captain in the war of 1812.Edgar Woods, History of Albemarle County in Virginia (1901, Heritage classic reprint) p, 200 Another of Hudson Garland's sons became General John Garland, who continued his Army career through the war with Mexico, and served briefly during the American Civil War, but died of disease in New York City on June 5, 1861); his daughter had become the wife of Lt. Confederate General James Longstreet. Another brother, Samuel Garland Sr., became a successful lawyer in Lynchburg, as well as a landowner (for whom Garland Hill was named), and the uncle of Confederate Brig. General Samuel Garland, Jr. (who died in September 1862). This James Garland received a private education and began reading law, and married Sarah Burch in the newly created Nelson County on September 22, 1814. They had at least one daughter who survived them (Sallie B. Garland Christian, 1837-1928). By 1820, the Garland household included five free people (including two sons and a daughter younger than 10) and nine slaves.U.S. Federal Census 1820 for Nelson County, Virginia. The 1830 federal census summary indicates the household then included nine free white persons and 2 slaves. The 1850 census includes possibly three different individuals: James P. Garland of Eastern Amherst County (who owned at least 10 slaves), James Garland who owned land (both improved and forested) in Nelson County (but without a slave schedule), and this James Garland in Lynchburg whose household consisted of lawyer James Garland, his wife and daughter, as well as his lawyer father and possibly two sisters, as well as a 25 year old young Virginia lawyer, William M. Cabell, and a 26 year old Connecticut born teacher, E.W. Brainard, but with no slave schedule. The 1860 Virginia census for Lynchburg apparently does have slave schedules for one or two men named James Garland (one in Lynchburg and another in the Western District of Campbell County), but such is not available for general viewing on ancestry.com's library edition. Career After reading law and being admitted to the Virginia bar, Garland began practicing law practice in Lovingston, Virginia, the seat of Nelson County. He left practice for a short time to serve in the War of 1812.

The game was released on September 22, 2004 in Japan, September 14, 2004 in North America and February 18, 2005 in Europe. The American and European editions of the game are published by Ubisoft. The game is a sequel to Sega Saturn's Guardian Heroes. Since Sega is the original copyright holder and was not interested in assuming the production of a sequel, Treasure had to license the intellectual property from Sega in order to carry out the game themselves.  Gameplay  Advance Guardian Heroes is a side-scrolling beat 'em up in which the playable characters can perform various attacks. Physical moves include countering and mid-air dashes. Magic attacks, which drain the MP meter, include element spells and protective barriers. It's also possible to go into \\"Hyper Mode\\", a faster, more powerful version of the playable character. The game is separated in various stages and sub-stages with their own boss-fights, enemies, and puzzles. Gameplay modes include \\"Story\\" for up to two players, \\"Versus\\" and \\"Training\\". Unlike its predecessor, Advance Guardian Heroes allows players to move smoothly towards and away from the screen, as opposed to switching between 3 planes. Some platforming elements have been added to break up the combat, and two new jumping manoeuvres, the air-dash and the homing jump, have been implemented. Some sequences in which these moves are used seem to be references to various 8-bit and arcade games, and some wire-fu films. A large part of the game relies on a revised \\"barrier spell.\\" All playable characters (and enemies on higher difficulty settings) have the barrier spell available, and at the cost of magic-over-time, it renders a character invincible. Properly timed use of the barrier spell allows a player to reflect projectiles and magic (in a visual effect reminiscent of Mischief Makers' Marina Liteyears throwing a laser or lightning bolt back at its source), or stun enemies who attack in melee. A green gauge is used to represent the character's (and speculatively, the player's) anger. At any point that the player's character is rendered immobile or out of the player's control, the player can rapidly press buttons to increase the anger gauge. Points allocated to the character's mobility grant bonuses to how quickly this gauge increases. When it flashes, the character can press A+B simultaneously to activate \\"Hyper Mode\\" or \\"Anger Mode,\\" starting a timer in which the anger gauge decreases, the magic gauge increases, the character is given a burst of speed, and the player is returned control of his character. If the player's character dies during the course of the game, a sinister figure appears and offers to give the character invincibility in exchange for his soul. If the player refuses, the princess appears and reassures the player that there will be another chance, before the game transitions to a game over screen. If the player agrees to the sinister figure's conditions, then the character is brought back to life in a state referred to as, \\"Devil Mode\\" that is unable to take damage (although still able to be knocked down and flung around) for the next 6 minutes, before the sinister figure reappears and destroys him, resulting in a game over screen. Regardless of the player's choice, he is able to continue the game from the last checkpoint reached before going into \\"Devil Mode.\\" Also, unlike the first game, the player is allowed to use almost every character that he unlocks, in the main story as well as in the other modes. Throughout the game, defeated enemies will drop crystals of varying sizes and colour, that act as the experience points. Between stages, players can allocate these crystals towards one or more of their character's attributes: Vitality, Mind, Attack, Defence, Magical Attack, Magical Defence, and Mobility. At certain points, the player has to fight the heroes of the previous game, and upon defeating them, they will give up their souls, which will increase one of attributes by 10. Increasing an attribute with soul crystals will raise the character's level, no matter how high that attribute was to begin with. The higher the character's level, the more soul crystals will be needed to reach the next level, so players have to allocate their points carefully. Anything left over after allocation, can be donated towards unlocking further playable characters.  Plot  The story follows the events of Guardian Heroes. After the Undead Hero was returned to his rest, the heroes were given the option of becoming the Sky Spirit's perfect warriors. The group was divided, with Nicole, Serena, and Valgar joining the Sky Spirit, and Han and Genjiro refusing. Randy escaped back to earth on his own, leaving Han and Genjiro to fight a losing battle against their former comrades. Years later, Zur returns. He resurrects Kanon and uses the power of the Guardian Heroes to take over the world. The few remaining resistance forces call upon the power of the Undead Hero once again, with one young soldier giving up his body to serve as its vessel. Throughout the game, the character fights the previous heroes and earns their power. Ultimately, it is revealed this is another attempt by the heavens to create the ultimate warrior. In the final battle against the ruler of the heavens, all heroes gather to defeat it and subsequently leave for the Other World.  Reception  The game received mixed reviews in English-speaking countries according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. While most critics praised the visuals and the gameplay, they criticized the story and the game suffering from frame rate problems.

The suites and media center represent phase two of a three-phase $4.5 million stadium upgrade. Phase one consisted of a $350,000 renovation of the stadium's entrance and ticket office. Completed in 2002, the project was funded with state dollars. Phase three increased the stadium's permanent seating capacity from 7,500 to 8,700 and was financed with a combination of public funds and private donations. \\"Our ability to bring prospective donors and entertain them is important,\\" says Barnes. \\"It will create a revenue stream for us over time. It's also an important piece in the recruiting process.\\" Scott Barnes says EWU will market the suites to donors, who will pay $30,000 to lease them for five years. The project called for a two-level structure to replace the existing about press box with the enclosed suites and a new press box on the west side of the stadium.

The precise location and boundaries of the abbey are difficult to determine in today's landscape. The original building was founded c. 1270 by the Lord Edward, later Edward I for Cistercian monks. Edward had supposedly taken a vow during a rough sea crossing in the 1260s. Civil wars and political upheaval delayed the build until 1272, the year he inherited the throne. The original site at Darnhall was unsatisfactory, so was moved a few miles north to the Delamere Forest. Edward intended the structure to be on a grand scale—had it been completed it would have been the largest Cistercian monastery in the country—but his ambitions were frustrated by recurring financial difficulties. Early during construction, England became involved in war with Wales. As the treasury was thus in need of resources, Vale Royal lost all of its grants, skilled masons and builders. When work resumed in the late 14th century, the building was considerably smaller than originally planned. The project encountered other problems. The abbey was mismanaged and poor relations with the local population sparked outbreaks of violence on a number of occasions. In one such episode in 1336, the abbot was killed by a mob. Internal discipline was also frequently bad; in the 14th century the monks were often accused of serious crimes including rape, and the abbots were seen as protecting them. The abbey was devastated at least twice: in the early 1300s a fire destroyed the entire monastic grange, and in 1359—soon after building work had recommenced under the patronage of Edward the Black Prince—a great storm caused the collapse of the massive nave. Vale Royal was closed in 1538 by Henry VIII during his dissolution of the Monasteries campaign, although not without controversy. In the course of the proceedings, the abbot was accused of treason and murder, and he in turn accused the King's men of fraudulently forging the abbot's signature on essential legal documents. But the abbey's closure was inevitable, and its estates were sold to a member of the local Cheshire gentry, Thomas Holcroft. Holcroft pulled much of it down (including the church), although he incorporated some of the cloister buildings into the new mansion he built on the site in the 1540s. This was subsequently considerably altered and extended by successive generations of Holcrofts. Vale Royal came into the possession of the Cholmondeley family during the early 1600s, and remained the family seat for more than 300 years. The Cholmondeley family remodelled the exterior during the 18th century, and Thomas Cholmondeley carried out extensive work in the early 1800s. Substantial alterations were carried out under the auspices of Edward Blore in 1833 and by John Douglas from 1860. Sold soon after the Second World War, it was turned into a private golf club. The building remains habitable and contains parts of the medieval abbey, including its refectory and kitchen. The foundations of the church and cloister have been excavated; Vale Royal Abbey, a scheduled monument, is listed in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II* listed building. Foundation Vale Royal Abbey was originally founded in Darnhall by the Lord Edward, the future Edward I, before his accession to the throne. He was supposedly caught in rough weather crossing the English Channel in the early 1260s, during which, the abbey's own chronicler later wrote, the King's son and his entourage feared for their lives. Edward pleaded with the Virgin Mary to intercede, and vowed to found an abbey in her name if they were saved. According to the chronicle, the sea calmed almost immediately and the ships returned safely to England. When the last man had stepped ashore, the chronicler continues, the storm resumed more violently than ever and Edward's ship was destroyed in the harbour. This chronology, however, does not fit with what is known of Edward's movements in this period. His only crusade was in 1270, after which he did not return until his father Henry III had died in 1272. By that time, Darnhall Abbey's foundation charter had already been granted. The charter mentions the King being \\"sometime in danger upon the sea\\", and it has been suggested by a recent biographer that it refers to a stormy English Channel crossing during the 1260s. Michael Prestwich has noted a crusader connection for Edward's new foundation: the first charter concerned with the project is dated four years earlier than the foundation charter, in August 1270, just before Edward left on crusade. Prestwich suggests that Edward probably founded the abbey more as a plea for Mary's future protection during his crusade rather than her past intervention at sea. Regardless of Edward's intentions when founding the abbey, the deteriorating political situation and eventual civil war between his father and the nobility —in which Edward played a prominent role— stalled plans for the abbey's build. In 1265 the rebel barons were defeated at the Battle of Evesham, and the following year negotiations were completed for the establishment of a Cistercian monastery in Darnhall in Cheshire. This was to be paid for with the manor house and estate of the earls of Chester, which were now in royal hands. In August 1270, Edward granted another charter at Winchester to his new abbey with a further endowment of land and churches. = Closure of Darnhall Abbey = The abbey's build was problematic. Preparation took considerable time, and the first monks—led by Abbot John Chaumpeneys—did not arrive at Darnhall from Dore Abbey (Vale Royal's motherhouse) until 1274. The new abbey provoked anger and resistance from local people, who believed that it (and its newly granted lands) threatened their livelihoods. The abbey had received the forestry rights and free warren of Darnhall Forest, which surrounded the villages, and in which the villagers had previously had free rein. Darnhall's location was unsuitable for a large construction. It may have been intended as a temporary site; in 1276 Edward (by then King) agreed to move the abbey to a more suitable location. A new site was chosen in nearby Over, on the edge of the Forest of Mondrem. On 13 August 1277, the king and Queen Eleanor, their son Alphonso and a number of nobles arrived at Over to lay the foundation stones of the new abbey for the high altar. Chaumpeneys then said a celebratory mass. In 1281, the monks moved from Darnhall to temporary accommodations on the Vale Royal site while the abbey was being built. Pevsner's Buildings of England described Vale Royal as a \\"late foundation as Cistercian settlements go\\". It was intended to be the largest and most elaborate Cistercian church in Christian Europe. The precise location and boundaries of the site is difficult to determine. It lay broadly within the monks' manor of Conersley, on parcels of land later renamed Vale Royal after the royal patron. The southern boundary was probably around Petty Pool, past Earnslow to the River Weaver. Its total area was about .  Construction  =Building= Illustration of the layout of the abbey as discovered through 20th-century archaeological excavation and its relation to the modern-day great house During an excavation in 1958, the site of the abbey—at the time, heavily wooded and similar to its medieval appearance—was described as Edward had grand ambitions for Vale Royal, as an important abbey, surpassing all the other houses of its order in Britain in scale and beauty. It was further intended to be symbolic of the wealth and power of the English monarchy and his own piety and greatness. He intended the abbey to be more grandiose than his grandfather King John's abbey at Beaulieu, and as a project, it was comparable to his father's Westminster Abbey. Henry, for example, had planned to be buried at Westminster, and Edward may have had similar plans for himself at Vale Royal. Vale Royal Abbey was his largest—although only known—major act of piety; he did not fund any other houses. The building's plans reflect Edward's enthusiasm. Fifty-one masons were employed from around the country; they were rarely local men, and may have been pressed into service. The chief architect, Walter of Hereford (one of the foremost of his day), work began on a huge, elaborate High Gothic church the size of a cathedral. Plans were extremely detailed; the abbey was to be furnished with thirty copes, two silver crosses, six chalices, a gold collar, a silver pastoral staff and other valuable possessions. It was to be long and cruciform in shape, with a central tower. The east end was semi- circular, with a chevet of 13 radiating chapels, some of which were square, and some polygonal. Each of the transepts had—as was common with Cistercian churches—a row of three chapels on its eastern side. South of the church stood a cloister square, surrounded by the domestic buildings. The undermaster of the works from 1278 to 1280—and paid three shillings a week—was John of Battle, who would later build the King's memorial crosses after Eleanor's death. Although Walter of Hereford initially seems to have found difficulty in gathering skilled masons to the project, in the second and third years recruitment was much improved. At the same time, however, the number of masons employed decreased from 92 in 1277 to 53 by 1280, who were paid between £200 and £260 over the three years. According to contemporary accounts for 1277 to 1281, 35,000 cartloads of stone—over 30 per day—were brought over rough roads nine miles from the Eddisbury quarries, five miles to the west. Timber came from local forests—particularly Delamere and Mondrem—to build workshops and dwellings, which together cost 45 shillings. A total of £3,000 was spent on construction during these four years, and in 1283 it was arranged that £1,000 per annum would be set aside for the on-going building. Funds were to be taken straight from the King's wardrobe. The King put one of his personal clerks—one Leonius, son of Leonius—in charge of the financial administration, appointing him Chamberlain of the city of Chester and custodian of the King's works at Vale Royal. Putting one man in charge of both posts was intended to accelerate the speed at which the abbey received its money, as until then, the local Exchequer received money which then had to be dispersed to the work's administrator. Leonius held this post for the next three years, with the \\"full cooperation\\" of the local justice in what Leonius described as \\"the expenses incurred in the works of the lord King at Vale Royal\\". In the early 1280s, the king greatly expanded the initial endowment, and made large donations of cash and materials. Money was plentiful and work progressed quickly. Initially providing 1,000 marks in cash for the project, Edward also provided the monks with revenue from his earldom of Chester; in 1281, the Justice of Chester was instructed to disburse the same amount to the monks each year. Leonius moved on to other projects that year, and the abbot was placed in personal charge of the works' administration. Two years later, sufficient progress had been made to allow the new church to be consecrated by the Bishop of Durham, Anthony Bek; Edward and his court attended the service. The King donated a relic of the True Cross which he had captured on his crusade to the abbey. In 1287 the abbot ordered a selection of marble columns and bases to be made for the cloister. These came from the Isle of Purbeck, and were created by Masters John Doget and Ralph of Chichester to Walter of Hereford's design, at a cost to the abbey of 3s. 6d. The abbot put down a deposit of £52 for the building work generally. During the winter months open stonework was covered with bundled hay to protect it from the elements. = Financial problems = Relative lengths of Vale Royal Abbey to Westminster Abbey The abbey's financing soon encountered difficulties. During the 1280s, the royal finances fell into arrears and eventually collapsed. War with Wales had broken out in 1282, and Edward needed money for troops and workmen to build castles, such as Harlech, which cemented the eventual conquest. He took the money which had been set aside for Vale Royal and its masons and other labourers. This was around the time that construction began on the monks' cloister, for which the marble columns were intended. The monks were still living in the temporary accommodation built at the start of the works. In 1290, Edward announced that he was no longer interested in the abbey: \\"the King has ceased to concern himself with the works of that church and henceforth will have nothing more to do with them\\". When Walter of Hereford sent to the Wardrobe to claim the robe he was annually issued as part of his contract, he was told this would be the last time, and he would receive neither wages nor robes from then on. The precise reasons for the King's volte-face are unknown. Historians have speculated that the monks may have incurred his displeasure somehow, or that it was connected to the illness and death of Queen Eleanor in November the same year; the art historian Nicola Coldstream has suggested that Edward had a \\"habit of abruptly stopping funds\\" for his religious projects. It is possible, says The King's Works, that \\"some of the building money may have been used for other purposes without the King's leave\\". Once-large royal grants became meagre, and the situation was exacerbated by the abbey not receiving monies rightfully due to them. Queen Eleanor had left it a legacy of 350 marks in her will, with the intention of establishing a chantry in her name and contributing generally to the ongoing works. Twenty years later, the abbey was still owed over half this amount from her executors. By 1291 they were in arrears to the tune of £1,808; the King authorised a one-off payment of £808, but the remainder went unpaid until 1312, five years after King Edward's death.. The monks struggled to complete and manage the vast project without royal officials. Despite possessing a substantial income from its own lands and feudal dues, the abbey amassed large debts to other church institutions, royal officials, building contractors and even the merchants of Lucca. Funds may have been misappropriated. Work stopped for at least a decade after 1290, at least in part due to the transference of the county revenues from the abbey to the newborn Prince of Wales, who was also made Earl of Chester. Workmen refused to work for fear of not being paid. When the works eventually resumed they were on a much-reduced scale; if the King had suspected embezzlement at the abbey, by 1305, suggests the History of the King's Works, he had \\"relented\\" sufficiently to make them a rant of £40 to pay for the roof. The authors note that from then on, construction With the accession of the Prince of Wales as King Edward II in 1307, some reimbursement for the abbey's funds arrived. £100 was sourced from The Peak, a nearby royal manor, and in 1312, they were granted £80 per annum from Ashford in the Peak. This only lasted five years, when the King granted the manor to his brother Edmund of Woodstock. =Relations with tenants= In addition to the burden of trying to finish the abbey buildings, Vale Royal faced other serious problems. As the medievalists Gwilym Dodd and Alison McHardy have emphasised, \\"a religious house, like any other landlord, depended on the income from its estates as the main source of its economic wellbeing\\", and from the late 12th century, monastic institutions were \\"particularly assiduous in...seeking to tighten the legal definition of servile status and tenure\\" for its tenantry. From its foundation, Vale Royal was no exception, and the monks' relationship with their tenants and neighbours soon deteriorated and remained usually poor. The abbey was resented by the people of Darnhall and Over, who found themselves under its feudal lordship. This made the previously free tenants villeins. Tenants of Darnhall attempted to withdraw from paying the abbot in 1275 (only a year after the abbey's foundation), and continued to feud with Vale Royal's abbots over the next fifty years. The dispute was mainly caused by forestry rights; the new abbey was in the forest of Mondrem, which had been mostly common land until it was granted to the abbey. Keeping it common land would have prevented the monks from utilising it, so the abbey effectively received immunity from the foresting laws, and, say Bostock and Hogg, \\"almost certainly\\" over-reached itself regularly. Abbots were also feudal lords, and not necessarily sympathetic landlords because of their ecclesiastical position; when their tenants appeared before the abbot's manorial court, they appeared before a judge and common law applied. The abbots may have been oppressive landlords, with the people responding fiercely to what historian Richard Hilton called a form of \\"social degradation\\". With a generally uncertain income, and massive outgoings, the monks may have had to be harsh landlords, although they apparently undertook their duties as landlords with zeal. Scholars are uncertain as to whether the abbey was as harsh a landlord as the villagers claimed. Previous landlords, such as the earls of Chester, may have been lax in their enforcement of serfdom, and so Darnhall and Over probably became accustomed to their relative freedom. Alternatively, the monks may have been lax in enforcement feudal laws, leading the villagers of Darnhall and its surrounding area to take advantage of them. The villagers prosecuted their struggle in earnest, sometimes in law and sometimes with violence. They attacked monastic officials a number of times; a monk was attacked and a servant killed while collecting tithes in Darnhall in 1320 (under Abbot Richard of Evesham), and Abbot Peter was killed in 1339 while defending the abbey. They made multiple approaches to both the King and Queen—often travelling great distances to do so—but to no avail. The Round Tower Lodge is situated in the central reservation of the A556 road in Sandiway. All that survives of Vale Royal Abbey's gate lodge, the road was built around it in the 1930s. It is a Grade II listed building.  Estates and finances  The village of Over was the centre of the abbey's estates, and was (like the surrounding villages) under the abbot's feudal lordship. The abbey's original endowment at Darnhall included the Delamere Forest site, the manors in Darnhall, Langwith in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and the advowsons of Frodsham, Weaverham, and Ashbourne and Castleton. Further grants of land included Conewardsly in 1276, followed in 1280 by estates on the Wirral. The abbey also received manors belonging to members of the local gentry in 1285, including those of Hugh de Merton (around Over), Bradford and Guilden Sutton. Ashbourne, though, was not held for long; within a few years, Vale Royal was forced to cede the advowson to Lincoln Cathedral for £400. In exchange, the king arranged for Vale Royal to receive the wealthy Kirkham Priory. Then in the possession of Shrewsbury, a combination of royal pressure and legal chicanery forced Shrewsbury to renounce its rights. According to Jeffrey Denton, \\"even [Vale Royal's] own chronicler cast some doubt on the justice of these proceedings\\". The abbey had a glassmaking forge in Delamere Forest which earned a small profit for the first few decades of its operation, although—for now unknown reasons—it seems to have ceased production around 1309. Wool exports were the abbey's main source of income. In 1283, Abbot Chaumpeneys acknowledged receipt of 53s 6d 8p as an advance on the abbey's eventual delivery of twelve sacks of collecta. These transactions were made before the merchant sold the wool, with the proviso that the profit was returned to the monastery. In the mid-1330s, Abbot Peter calculated that the abbey's income was £248 17s, of which £60 was spent on hospitality, £16 on wages for the abbey's servant staff, £21 for the abbot's expenses, £30 for defensive measures, and £50 in \\"gifts, damages and contributions\\". The remainder—insufficient, said Abbot Peter in 1336—was spent on the monks' everyday needs. By 1342, under Abbot Robert de Cheyneston, the abbey was £20 in debt and a fire had burnt down its monastic granges at Bradford and Hefferston; the monks, who lost all the corn in the granges, had to purchase enough to live on until the next harvest. Robert lamented the £100 he required to repair the granges, their weirs, portions of the church roof and the abbey building. Vale Royal's finances seem to have improved by the 15th century. Two taxes assessed the abbey at £346 0s. 4d in 1509 and, twenty-six years later, at £540 6s 2d. Income was up, and expenses were down; about £92 was spent in 1509, and slightly over £21 in 1535. Although the abbey was wealthy in goods and oxen, it had many fewer monks then originally intended; the abbot of Dore, visiting Vale Royal in 1509, found fifteen resident monks instead of a reported population of thirty.  Later middle ages  In spite of the abbey's financial difficulties, building continued, albeit at a slow pace, and by 1330 the monks were able to move from their \\"temporary\\" dwellings into their main quarters. The same year also saw the completion of the east end of the church—the remainder still a shell—and enough of the cloister buildings to make the abbey habitable, although far from complete. Much of the main vault remained exposed to the Cheshire weather. Royal funding had nearly dried up, and Abbot Peter complained in 1336 that vaults, cloisters, the chapter house and dormitories were yet to be built. He complained that, Abbot Robert de Cheyneston—in office between about 1340 and 1345—may have been responsible for roofing the choir and the church's north end in lead. In 1353 brought cause for renewed hope. Edward the Black Prince—King Edward III's son and heir (now the Earl of Chester)—was fully invested in his father's wars in France, and Cheshire was an important source of troops. The prince lavishly patronised the county's gentry and institutions, with Vale Royal (described by Anthony Emery as an \\"extravagant 'war' church\\") foremost among them. Edward had nominally taken Vale Royal under his protection in 1340, was keen to see the abbey completed. He donated substantial funds: 500 marks in cash immediately, with the same amount paid five years later when visited personally. In 1359, Prince Edward granted Vale Royal the advowson and church of Llanbadarn Fawr, Ceredigion to further finance construction. William Helpeston was contracted to oversee construction in August 1359, for which the abbey contracted to provide—on top of his wages—board and lodging for himself and his men. Their tools and fuel would also be paid for. He would also receive a life annuity of 40 shillings a year. This work was expected to take six years, although in the event went over time: a commission to impress masons in 1354 had to be renewed six years later. The abbey choir was completed during the first year; scholars are now uncertain as to what degree Helpeston was still building in accordance with de Hereford's 13th-century plans or was introducing elements of his own design. Helpeston plans provided for an apsidal choir comprising an ambulatory and thirteen chapels, seven heptagonal protruding and six, smaller rectangular chapels facing inwards. There were problems with securing Helpston's continued commitment; his contract was renegotiated within the year; this time, it was specified that rather than being paid directly, the money would be paid to the abbot who would then pay Helpeston having inspected his work. Work focussed on completing the shell of the nave and developing the east end, and may have been based on a similar design for Toledo Cathedral. During a great storm on 19 October 1359, however, much of the nave (including the new lead roof installed by the previous abbot) was blown down and destroyed. The arcades of the unfinished nave were reduced to rubble. The destruction ranged \\"from the wall at the west end to the bell-tower before the gates of the choir\\", and the timber scaffolding collapsed \\"like trees uprooted by the wind\\". There are no recorded indications of poor building practices or degraded fabric to the construction, and the now-destroyed nave presented its own architectural problems for rebuilding. Repairs were slowly made over the next thirteen years, and Abbot Thomas may have been responsible for the \\"unique chevet of seven radiating chapels\\", which were built by de Hepleston and cost £860. This was \\"clearly intended to be the crowning feature of the great church\\". Work was still being done in 1368 when the Prince of Wales recommissioned the masons for the third time. The remodelled church would now be smaller than before, with the nave proportionally reduced in height and width. The Black Prince died in 1376, and, says The King's Works, \\"it must have been obvious to the monks that the days of royal munificence were over\\". Work continued on the same reduced scale took place into the reign of Richard II, who patronised the abbey on a small scale in honour of it being a royal foundation. The King was reported to be \\"much pleased\\" at the reduction in both the abbey's size and cost. Repairs and construction continued sporadically into the 15th century, with an aisle installed in the middle of the church in 1422. Little else is known of the abbey until the reign of King Henry VIII in the 16th century. =Relations with local gentry= Relations with the gentry were no better in the later Middle Ages than they had been with the tenantry years earlier, and the gentry also often came to blows with the monks. The abbey was involved in feuds with a number of the prominent local families, frequently ending in large-scale violence. During the 14th and 15th centuries, Vale Royal was beset by other scandals. Many abbots were incompetent, venal, or criminally inclined, and the house was often grossly mismanaged. Discipline grew lax; disorder at the abbey during this period prompted reports of serious crimes, including attempted murder. Abbot Henry Arrowsmith, who had a particular reputation for lawlessness, was hacked to death in 1437 by a group of men (one of whom was the vicar of Over) in revenge for a suspected rape by one of the abbey's monks. Although the abbey was taken under royal supervision in 1439, there was no immediate improvement, and Vale Royal of the General Chapter, the international Cistercian governing body, during the 1450s. The chapter ordered senior abbots to investigate the abbey, which the abbots concluded was in a \\"damnable and sinister\\" situation in 1455. Things then improved somewhat, and Vale Royal's last years were peaceful and well-ordered. Some building work continued, as records attest to grants of timber for repairs were made in 1510 and 1515. The abbot of Dore visited Vale Royal in 1509—by which time the abbey held 19 monks—and made a brief inventory of its rooms, including the Abbot's chambers (which were described as containing \\"a suitable couch, ten coverlets, four mattresses, two feather beds and twelve pairs of linen sheets\\"). According to archaeologist S. J. Moorhouse, luxuries such as these indicate how far the Cistercian focus had drifted from the order's original asceticism. =Last abbatial election= Abbot John Butler died in summer 1535. The election of his replacement indicates the extent to which the local gentry interfered in the house's internal affairs. William Brereton and Piers Dutton—local knights and rivals for regional power in the county—both proposed their own candidates. The election became mired in corruption; Dutton's man, for example, offered Thomas Cromwell—Henry VIII's chief minister—£100 and promised to him \\"as large pleasure as any man\\" in future. Adam Beconsall and Thomas Legh—the monastic visitor, who himself had accepted a £15 bribe—backed one John Hareware, the former abbot of Hulton Abbey. Furthermore, Queen Anne Boleyn herself also favoured a particular candidate. In the event, King Henry ordered a free election, and this saw Hareware elected. Although his candidate had lost, Brereton still managed to wrangle granted an annual pension of £20 from Hareware for the rest of Brereton's life. More importantly for the new abbot, Cromwell was appointed steward of the abbey by the King. In common with many other monasteries—by now aware of their impending dissolution—Hareware began raising ready cash. This was done by means of negotiating long tenancies for their lands at very low rents in exchange for high entry fees. Dissolution By 1535 Vale Royal was one of only six monastic institutions remaining in Cheshire. It was reported that year's Valor Ecclesiasticus as possessing an income of £540, making it the wealthiest of the 13th-century Cistercian foundations and the fourth-wealthiest overall. Much of the income seems to have been increasingly used for bribing the local gentry and providing them with pensions. The income enabled Vale Royal to escape dissolution under the First Suppression Act, King Henry VIII's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries, by which time its population had declined to 15 monks. Abbot John Hareware pursued a two-pronged policy of attempting to ensure the abbey's survival and, if that failed, the security of himself and his brethren. Hareware bribed courtiers, influential nobles and (in particular) chief minister Thomas Cromwell with money and property in an attempt to gain a respite for the abbey, and leased most of the abbey lands to friends and associates of the monastery to keep them out of royal hands if the abbey fell. Many of the leases had a clause voiding them if the abbey survived. Hareware sold its other assets, such as livestock and timber, for cash.left The process of dissolution at Vale Royal was begun in September 1538 by the royal commissioner Thomas Holcroft, who was ordered to \\"take and recyve\\" the abbey from Hareware. The situation grew legally murky as Holcroft, probably with a forged signature on the deed of exchange, claimed that the abbey had surrendered to him on 7 September. The abbot (and abbey) denied doing so, questioning Holcroft's authority. Holcroft then alleged that the abbot had attempted to take over the abbey himself, and had tried to conspire with Holcroft to commit land fraud. The monks continued to petition the government, particularly Thomas Cromwell, who was responsible for church affairs in his role as vicar general during the Royal Supremacy. Hareware wrote to the chief minister during his journey to London: In December 1538, Abbot John and his community received a papal dispensation to change habits and temporarily join another order. With some disquiet probable in government circles about the legitimacy of the Vale Royal surrender, steps were taken to put the matter beyond doubt. A special court was held at the abbey on 31 March 1539, with Cromwell the judge. Instead of investigating the circumstances of the surrender the court charged the abbot with treason and conspiracy in the murder of a monk (who had committed suicide) in 1536. He was also accused of \\"treasonous utterances\\" during the Pilgrimage of Grace; both murder and treason were capital crimes. The abbot was found guilty, and Vale Royal was declared forfeited to the crown. Abbot John was not executed: rather, he was given a substantial pension of £60 per year and the abbey's silver plate, indicating that the trial was a means of pressuring him to acquiesce to Cromwell. The rest of the community were also pensioned off, and Exchequer records indicate that Abbot John lived until at least 1546. The abbey's immediate estates were incorporated into the new parish of Whitegate. Later history The Tudor mansion that replaced Vale Royal, as seen in 2005, built around the core of the former south and west cloister, contains surviving rooms (including the abbot's great hall). After protracted negotiations with the crown, Thomas Holcroft leased Vale Royal. Previously an obscure member of the lower Cheshire gentry, the acquisition made him a man of substance. In 1539 he demolished the church, telling King Henry in a letter that it was \\"plucked down\\". On 7 March 1544, the King confirmed Holcroft's ownership by granting him the abbey and much of its estates for £450. Holcroft further removed many of the abbey's domestic buildings, retaining the south and west cloister ranges—including the abbot's house and the monks' dining hall and kitchen—as the core of his mansion (which was centred on the abbey cloister). Holcroft built a grand external staircase to his new first-floor entrance, which, suggests the archaeologist J. Patrick Greene, \\"reinforced the visual reminder to all visitors that a new regime now prevailed\\" at Vale Royal. Holcroft retained the abbey gatehouse as the courtyard's entrance, and leased the abbey and its lands until he was knighted in 1544 when he purchased it outright. Holcroft's heirs lived at Vale Royal until 1615. During their residency canted bay windows were introduced to the front of the wings which, along with their accompanying mullions and transoms, have been described by Pevsner as \\"a remarkably early instance of Elizabethan revivalism\\". It was also around this time that the \\"crude gothic porch\\" of Holcroft's was moved to the ground floor. At this date the house came into the hands of the Cholmondeley family (later Lords Delamere). Mary Cholmondeley (1562–1625), a powerful widow with extensive properties in the area, bought the abbey as a home for herself when her eldest son inherited the primary family estates at Cholmondeley. In August 1617, she entertained James I and a stag-hunting party at Vale Royal. The king enjoyed himself so much that he knighted two members of the family and, in a letter written shortly after his visit, offered to advance the political careers of Lady Mary's sons if they would come to court. His offer was so firmly refused that the King called her \\"the Bolde Lady of Cheshire\\". Mary passed the abbey and estate to her fourth son, Thomas (who founded the family's Vale Royal branch), at her death in 1625. During the English Civil War, the Cholmondeleys supported Charles I. Their allegiance had serious consequences; fighting took place at Vale Royal, the house was looted, and the building's south wing was burned down by Parliamentarian forces commanded by General John Lambert. Despite this, the Cholmondeley family continued to live in the abbey. A southeast wing, designed by Edward Blore, was added to the building in 1833. In 1860, Hugh Cholmondeley, Baron Delamere commissioned Chester architect John Douglas to recast the centre of the south range (which had been timber-framed). Douglas added a southwest wing the following year and altered the dining room. The church of St Mary, the capella extra portis (chapel outside the abbey gates), remained opposite the west lodge. The church was largely rebuilt in 1728, incorporating fabrica ecclesiae from a timber-framed church probably dating to the 14th century. In 1874–1875 Douglas remodelled St Mary's, changing its external appearance but retaining much of the internal structure. left The Cholmondeley family lived in the abbey for over 300 years. In 1907 they rented it to a wealthy Manchester businessman Robert Dempster. Dempster had made his fortune from R & J Dempster and Sons, a gas-engineering company he founded in 1883. His second daughter, Edith, was born that year and lived at Vale Royal with her father until his 1925 death in South Africa. He was buried at Whitegate Church, near the abbey. Edith inherited half of his fortune and all of his personal effects, including the lease on Vale Royal. In the spring of 1926, she married Frank Pretty at Whitegate Church. Edith gave up the lease on Vale Royal and purchased the relatively modest Sutton Hoo estate later that year. Frank died at the end of 1934; Edith hired archaeologist Basil Brown to excavate some of the mounds on the Sutton Hoo estate in 1939, discovering northern Europe's richest Anglo- Saxon burial ground. Another Cholmondeley, Thomas, Baron Delamere, moved into the abbey in 1934; he was forced out in 1939, when the government took over Vale Royal to use as a sanatorium for convalescing soldiers during World War II. The Cholmondeleys regained the abbey after the war before selling it to Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in 1947. The company initially used the abbey as staff accommodation and, from 1954 to 1961, as the headquarters of its salt and alkali division. In 1958 they permitted (and assisted with labour and facilities) an extensive archaeological excavation, which was intended to complete an earlier dig of 1911–1912. ICI moved out in 1961. There were abortive schemes to use the abbey as a health centre, a country club, a school and a prison. In 1977, the abbey became a residential care home for people with learning disabilities. In 1998, Vale Royal became a private golf club. A proposal to turn the house into flats led to a detailed 1998 archaeological study by the Chester Archaeological Society. =Archaeological investigations and discovery of remains= Nothing remains of the great church and \\"virtually nothing\\" of the other ecclesiastical buildings, although archaeological work has revealed many details of the church's structure. According to A. Emery, \\"detailed examination of the roof ... has revealed hidden structural evidence beneath layers of post-medieval changes\\". Excavations by the Manchester architect Basil Pendleton were made in 1911–1912, which he focused around the Nun's Grave. Pendleton established that the church had been long, with a decoratively floored nave. The combined width of the east and west transepts was . The remainder of the construction was, at various times, around a grassed quadrangle–possibly a herb garden. Apart from the church (which took up the east side of the square), the buildings consisted of a chapter house, the abbot's dwelling, guest accommodations, and the outbuildings necessary for the upkeep of the community and its agricultural work. Much of the abbey's stonework was sold by Holcroft when it was destroyed. Some was used to build a common well; at least one domestic garden in Northwich contained original carvings and bosses, and abbey stones were found in the walls of three other houses. It is possible that the ceiling of Weaverham church's north aisle came from Vale Royal. Holcroft also rebuilt the western grange for his own use with stone from the church. The south wing of the extant building incorporates the original refectory roof, which has been dendrochronologically dated to the second half of the 15th century. It consisted, writes Emery, \\"of a timber- framed three-bay hall, open to the roof, flanked by a pair of single bay rooms, the whole set above a masonry ground floor\\". The 1958 excavation uncovered the 1359 additions, including the chevet apse. Pieces of stained glass were uncovered in Delamere Forest, while Purbeck marble and other architectural fragments were also found. Historian Jeffrey Denton has suggested that Vale Royal Abbey has been relatively unexamined by scholars because of its near-total mid-16th-century destruction; \\"had it survived, our views of Edward I's relations with the Church may well have been radically different\\". A circular stone monument, known as the Nun's Grave, reportedly commemorates Sister Ida, thought to be a 14th-century Cheshire nun who nursed an unnamed Vale Royal abbot, and who was buried at the high altar. The monument was erected by the Cholmondeley family, possibly to lend credence to the legend of the nun. The material in its construction is from three sources: the head from a medieval cross whose four panels depict the crucifixion, the virgin and child Jesus, St. Catherine and St. Nicholas; the shaft, made of sandstone in the 17th century; and a plinth from a reclaimed pillar base. Pevsner's Buildings of England has described the monument as looking \\"convincingly late 13th-century\\", and notes other remnants of pillars around the grounds \\"of great size and elaboration\\". The present country house on the site incorporates parts of the south and west ranges; the former has a door arch from the abbey, one of the few elements of the original abbey which is still visible. At least some of the original abbey still survives to the first floor; in 1992 a British Archaeological Association study discovered late- medieval graffiti scratched into plasterwork on an internal wall. Holcroft's Tudor house also stands. The building is a Grade II* listed building, and St Mary's church is listed at Grade II, while what remains of Vale Royal Abbey is a scheduled ancient monument.

On October 2, 1925, the tunnel collapsed on a work train, killing four men and trapping a steam locomotive and ten flat cars. Rescue efforts only resulted in further collapse, and the tunnel was eventually sealed for safety reasons. Portions of the tunnel have continued to wreak havoc above in the years since, and several houses and a wall of a church have been destroyed by sinkholes near 25th and Broad Streets. More recently, tennis courts and the wall of a house seem to have been victims farther east. Long the subject of community speculation and trespassing incidents at its eastern portal, the tunnel is owned by CSX Transportation. The tunnel, which is still considered dangerous, was featured in a 1998 newspaper article by Richmond Times-Dispatch reporter Mark Holmberg and photographer P. Kevin Morley; who explored portions from the eastern portal with professional caving personnel and equipment. History Church Hill Tunnel route =Purpose= The Church Hill Tunnel was completed in 1873 for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;), which was seeking to extend its trackage (of the former Virginia Central Railroad) from a terminus in the Shockoe Valley section of downtown Richmond to connect with the new Peninsula Subdivision extending approximately 75 miles southeast down the Virginia Peninsula to reach Collis P. Huntington's new coal pier in Newport News. The tracks to the new tunnel left the old Virginia Central line west of 17th street and curved southeasterly to enter the tunnel east of N. 18th Street and north of E. Marshall Street under Cedar Street. The east end of the tunnel appeared just north of Williamsburg Road near 31st Street, below Libby Terrace Park. The Peninsula line was completed and opened in late 1881, and the coal flowed eastward for export in massive quantities. =Construction problems= The construction of the tunnel was problematic. Unlike the bedrock through which the C&O; carved its western tunnels, Richmond's blue marl clay shrink- swell soil tended to change with rainfall and groundwater, causing cave-ins during the construction. Ten workers were reportedly killed. The tunnel has remained troublesome throughout its life due to ground water seepage and safety concerns, even after abandonment in 1925. =Safer alternative= In the 1890s, the C&O; acquired the Richmond and Allegheny Railroad (R&A;) which had been built east from the Blue Ridge Mountains along the towpath of the James River and Kanawha Canal, proving an alternate \\"water level\\" route to Richmond following the north bank of the James River and avoiding a more circuitous route which crossed the North Mountain and Afton Mountain via the Blue Ridge Tunnel and reached Richmond via the former Virginia Central Railroad. However, the R&A; terminated at Richmond's Byrd Street Station in the downtown area (7th St. and Canal St.), and did not have a track connection to the C&O; which ended at Shockoe Bottom at Broad Street, some distance away. The Virginia State Capitol and its grounds were directly between the two terminals, so creativity for a less direct connection was needed. To utilize the new \\"water level\\" line to ship coal to Newport News, and to avoid the troublesome tunnel as an added benefit, the C&O; constructed a three-mile-long double track elevated viaduct along the riverfront extending between the area of Hollywood Cemetery east past downtown Richmond, the Shockoe Valley, and Church Hill to join the Peninsula Subdivision at what became Fulton Yard east of the tunnel. With a connection just south of the new Main Street Station, it was now possible for traffic to come off the old Virginia Central and enter the Peninsula Subdivision without using the Church Hill Tunnel. Portions of the viaduct became known as the Rivanna Subdivision Trestle (west of Rivanna Junction) and Peninsula Subdivision Trestle (from the former Brown Street Yard through Main Street Station and Rivanna Junxction east to Fulton Yard). The viaduct is believed to be the longest in the United States and is still in use by CSX Corporation, which also owns the abandoned tunnel.) The viaduct is also the highest level of Richmond's famed Triple Crossing, with railroads at three levels, believed to be the only such place in the world, near where it crosses Richmond's flood wall. =Tunnel disuse, rehabilitation turns tragic= After completion of the viaduct in 1901, the Church Hill Tunnel fell into disuse for over 20 years. Then in 1925, to add capacity, the railroad began efforts to restore it to usable condition. On October 2, while repairs were under way, a work train was trapped by a collapse near the western end (near the intersection of N 18st Street and E Marshall, below Jefferson Park). Two workmen crawled under flat cars and escaped out the eastern end of the tunnel, as did the fireman Benjamin F. Mosby (who died hours later because of the burns caused by the ruptured boiler),Benjamin F Mosby Find a grave but the engineer Thomas Joseph Mason was killed; initial reports claimed that, besides Mason, six black laborers were unaccounted for,Bismarck Tribune October 3, 1925, accessed June 24, 2019 although the missing number of men were scaled down to two.Church Hill Tunnel During the next week, the community anxiously watched rescue efforts, but each time progress was made, further cave-ins occurred; only the body of Mason was recovered on October 10.Find A grave memorial Thomas J. Mason Possibly two workers, Richard Lewis and H. Smith, were missing.Flickr photograph accessed June 24,2019 Eventually, the Virginia State Corporation Commission (SCC), which regulated the state's railroads, ordered the tunnel sealed for safety reasons. Left inside was the work train, complete with a 4-4-0 steam locomotive (engine #231) and ten flat cars. Later years The east entrance to the tunnel, in 2010. Inside the east entrance to the tunnel, in 2010. The floor is under several inches of water. The far wall, where the tunnel is sealed off, is barely visible. Over the years, portions of the tunnel have collapsed. Several houses and a wall of a church near 25th and Broad Street were destroyed by one of the largest cave- ins to date. The line of the tunnel can clearly be traced by dips in some of the north-south streets crossing its path. The western end is covered with a concrete plug, but for years, the eastern end was used as part of a turning wye for a connection with the Southern Railway's line to West Point and could be entered by venturesome trespassers. Based upon a 1998 exploratory expedition by Richmond Times-Dispatch reporter Mark Holmberg, who explored portions from the eastern end with professional caving personnel and equipment, it is believed that most of the western portion of the tunnel which has not caved in is filled with water. The western entrance can still be seen at the south-east end of an alley off of 18th Street, just north of Marshall. A Virginia historical marker was placed at the site in 2012. The eastern end is hidden in a small, dense jungle just north of the intersection of E. Franklin Street and N. 31st Street. This end of the tunnel is still open for some distance, but its floor and the area outside are swampy. Recovery discussions In June 2006, the Virginia Historical Society and other parties announced that they were investigating the possibility of recovering the train and bodies; the Society planned to keep the train for preservation. The History Channel expressed interest in participating in the project. However, when a hole was drilled through the tunnel's seal and a camera was placed inside, the tunnel was discovered to be filled with silt and water, meaning that an excavation of the tunnel would likely cause it to further collapse and cause several homes on Church Hill to be engulfed by massive sinkholes. The project was put on hold.  Urban legend  The Church Hill Tunnel also has a connection to the urban legend of the Richmond Vampire.

The inversion itself is usually initiated by the cooling effect of the water on the surface layer of an otherwise warm air mass. As it cools, the surface air becomes denser than the warmer air above it, and thus becomes trapped below it. The layer may thicken through turbulence generated within the developing marine layer itself. It may also thicken if the warmer air above it is lifted by an approaching area of low pressure. The layer will also gradually increase its humidity by evaporation of the ocean or lake surface, as well as by the effect of cooling itself. Fog will form within a marine layer where the humidity is high enough and cooling sufficient to produce condensation. Stratus and stratocumulus will also form at the top of a marine layer in the presence of the same conditions there. In the case of coastal California, the offshore marine layer is typically propelled inland by a pressure gradient which develops as a result of intense heating inland, blanketing coastal communities in cooler air which, if saturated, also contains fog. The fog lingers until the heat of the sun becomes strong enough to evaporate it, often lasting into the afternoonSan Diego Union Tribune, May 7, 2010 during the \\"June gloom\\" period.San Diego Union Tribune, June 8, 2004 An approaching frontal system or trough can also drive the marine layer onshore. A marine layer will disperse and break up in the presence of instability, such as may be caused by the passage of a frontal system or trough, or any upper air turbulence that impinges on it. A marine layer can also be driven away by sufficiently strong winds. It is not unusual to hear media weather reporters discuss the marine layer as if it were synonymous with the fog or stratus it may contain, but this is erroneous. In fact, a marine layer can exist with virtually no cloudiness of any kind, although it usually does contain some.

Spanos Stadium, formerly known as Mustang Stadium, is an 22,000-seat multi-purpose stadium on the campus of California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), San Luis Obispo, in the U.S. state of California. The stadium is named after Alex Spanos, a Cal Poly alumnus, American billionaire real estate developer, founder of the A. G. Spanos Companies, and the majority owner of the Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League (NFL). History and renovation Alex G. Spanos Stadium grandstand Originally opened in 1935, the 8,500-seat stadium was expanded in 2006 to its current capacity. In addition, the stadium was renamed Alex G. Spanos Stadium after Alex Spanos in a ceremony on November 18, 2006. The recognition and subsequent renaming was a result of a $4 million donation to renovate Mustang Stadium by Mr. Spanos. This marked the largest single donation in the school's history, at the time. In 2013 Cal Poly replaced the south end zone stands with permanent aluminum stands. Cal Poly had rented the previous stands since the mid-1990s. As a result, building permanent stands is expected to save money over time. These stands also improved handicapped access. Additionally, Cal Poly renovated the lower portion the older east sideline stands to add handicapped seats and improve accessibility and egress. The new south stands increased capacity by 345 seats, while the renovation of the east stands resulted in a no net increase or decrease in seats. Proposals to further increase the stadium's capacity to 22,000 were first considered in 2013. Current tenants Cal Poly Mustangs football, as well as both the Cal Poly Mustangs men's soccer and Cal Poly Mustangs women's soccer teams, play their home games at Alex G. Spanos Stadium. On October 17, 2008, a record 11,075 people saw UC Santa Barbara defeat Cal Poly men's soccer 1–0 in double overtime, the third largest crowd in NCAA history for a non-tournament game.

It is home to the Marist College Red Foxes football team. The field was named after Dr. Alex Leonidoff, a local physician and avid Marist Athletics supporter. The facility opened in 1968. At the conclusion of the 2006 football season, the existing grandstand was removed to make way for a more modern, updated facility including modern press boxes, luxury suites, home and away locker rooms, an athletic training room as well as a new concession stand. Additionally, the grass natural turf surface was replaced with Field Turf synthetic surface. View of Tenney Stadium from the lawn seating during a football gameIt has a capacity of 5,000 with amphitheater-style seating on the west side of the field for lawn chairs and blankets. The facility includes a stone-faced precast concrete grandstand. The ground level field house contains two large, day-lit varsity locker rooms with showers, a medical training room, an equipment room, and support spaces. A field storage room is provided with vehicular access. The building also includes a public concession stand and restrooms. Lockers and concession areas are highlighted on the façade by large wooden exterior alcoves that create bays for students and players. The new grandstand features a large press box, served by elevators, that is equipped with a state-of-the-art sound system and wireless communications. VIP hospitality wings provide seating for 120 people with a fully operable window wall facing the field. Press box and VIP seats also provide views of the Hudson River and the Poughkeepsie Bridge beyond. Objections were raised to the removal of approximately 20 trees in preparation for this project. The oldest of the trees was determined post-mortem to be 180 years old. It began life around the same time as the founder of the Marist Brothers, Saint Marcellin Champagnat, and was therefore in existence 80 years before the college was established. The objections abated after an e-mail was distributed by the administration stating that the planting of 40 new trees was included in the project plans. Designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP, the project was completed for the start of the 2007 football season. It now serves five varsity sports programs for the school.

Early years Douglass was born in Guadalajara, Mexico, in 1910 to an American family.variety.com His father was an engineer on assignment there, and eventually relocated the family to Nevada. Douglass graduated from the University of Nevada with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, and eventually found work as a sound engineer with CBS Radio in Los Angeles. During World War II, Douglass served in the Navy and worked in Washington with engineers developing shipboard radar systems. The mysterious \\"laff box\\" Before TV, audiences often experienced comedy in the presence of other audience members. Television producers attempted to recreate this atmosphere in the early days by introducing laughter or other crowd reactions into the soundtrack of TV programs. However, live audiences could not be relied upon to laugh at the correct moment.Kitman, Marvin. \\"Don't Make Me Laugh,\\" Channels of Communication, August/September 1981 Douglass noticed this problem, and decided to remedy the situation.Levin, Eric. \\"Who does all that laughing?\\" TV Guide, 8 April 1978 If a joke did not get the desired chuckle, Douglass inserted additional laughter. If the live audience chuckled too long, Douglass gradually muted the laughter. This editing technique became known as \\"sweetening,\\" in which pre-recorded laughter is used to augment the response of the real studio audience if they did not react as desired. At first, Douglass's technique was used sparingly on live shows like The Jack Benny Program; as a result, its invention went unnoticed.Iverson, Paul: \\"The Advent of the Laugh Track\\" Hofstra University archives; February 1994. By the end of the 1950s, live comedy transitioned from film to videotape, which allowed for editing during post-production. By editing a prerecorded live show, bumps and gaps were present in the soundtrack.\\"The Talk of the Town: Laughs,\\" The New Yorker 10 September 1984. Douglass was called upon to \\"bridge\\" or \\"fill\\" these gaps. Both performers and producers gradually began to realize the power behind prerecorded laughter. Comedian Milton Berle, while witnessing a post- production editing session, once said, \\"as long as we are here, this joke didn't get all that we wanted.\\" After Douglass inserted a guffaw after a failed joke, Berle reportedly commented, \\"See? I told you it was funny.\\" Douglass went from enhancing soundtracks to orchestrating audience reactions. A team of \\"Laff Boys,\\" technicians trained to operate Douglass's Laff Box, created extremely detailed textures designed to suggest specific ethical situations.McCarthy, David. \\"Textured Voices and the Performance of Ethical Life in the Case of the Laff Box (1966).\\" Twentieth-Century Music 13, no. 1 (March 2016): 109–137. By the early 1960s, the recording of TV sitcoms before audiences had fallen out of fashion, and Douglass was employed to simulate audience response for entire programs. Shows like Bewitched, The Munsters and The Beverly Hillbillies are virtually showcases of Douglass' editing work. Low-key shows, like The Andy Griffith Show, The Brady Bunch and My Three Sons, had less raucous laugh tracks, but were entirely fabricated post-production. The practice of simulating an audience reaction was controversial from the beginning, but it became standard practice and a commodity in the industry. Douglass formed Northridge Electronics in August 1960, named after the Los Angeles suburb in the San Fernando Valley where the Douglass family resided and operated their business. From the late 1950s to the early 1970s, Douglass had a virtual monopoly on the laugh-track business.Washington Post Thursday, April 24, 2003; Page B06: \\"Charles Douglass, 93; Gave TV Its Laugh Track\\" In 1966, TV Guide critic Dick Hobson said the Douglass family were \\"the only laugh game in town.\\" When it came time to \\"lay in the laughs\\", the producer would direct Douglass where and when to insert the type of laugh requested. Douglass would then go to work at creating the audience, concealed from the producer (or anyone else present at the studio) to preserve the secrecy of his technique. Consequently, few in the industry witnessed Douglass using his invention.\\"Canned Laughter: A History Reconstructed. Interview with Ben Glenn II, Television Historian\\" at andheresthekicker.com The one-of-a-kind laugh- track device—known throughout the industry as the \\"laff box\\"—was secured with padlocks, was more than two feet tall, and operated like an organ. Only immediate members of the family knew what the inside looked like. At one time, the laff box was called \\"the most sought after but well-concealed box in the world\\". Douglass' laff box was unearthed in 2010. It was later discussed in detail in a June 2010 episode of Antiques Roadshow, where its historical value was appraised at $10,000. In 1986, Charley's son Bob began experimenting with an all-digital audio computer manufactured by CompuSonics at Palo Alto, California company as a replacement for the analog equipment invented by his father. By 1990, Bob was using a custom version of CompuSonics equipment that had multiple channels of digital audio samples and a laptop computer interface for control. The new Laff Box was loaded and unloaded from the trunk of Bob's Mercedes-Benz with a small crane bolted to the trunk floor.Private communications between Northridge and CompuSonics provided by David Schwartz, ex-CEO of CompuSonics The modern equivalent of the laff box is a digital device approximately the size of a laptop computer which contains hundreds of human sounds. Later years and death Douglass moved to Laguna Beach, California in 1970 and retired there in 1980. He died of pneumonia on April 8, 2003 in Templeton, California at age 93.

IMG Academy offers camp programs on a year-round basis and serves as a training and competition venue for amateur, collegiate, and professional teams, adults, and families and as a host site for a variety of events. History Nick Bollettieri founded the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy in 1978. Sports and entertainment company IMG purchased the academy in 1987. IMG acquired the youth division of the David Leadbetter Golf Academy in 1993 and added programs for soccer and baseball in 1994. Hockey and basketball programs were added in 2000 and 2001, respectively, and by 2002 the IMG campus had expanded to . IMG Academy suspended its hockey program in 2003. Football was added in 2010, as well as lacrosse. Track & field and cross country were added in 2013. IMG Academy currently sits on of land, and in 2011, IMG paid $7.5 million for an additional adjacent to the current campus for future expansion. In 2014, IMG purchased an additional . The land borders IMG's west campus, where the sports performance academy is undergoing a $198 million expansion. The IMG Pendleton School was founded in 1999 as a co-educational, college preparatory school for athletic students. In 2012, the school changed its name to \\"IMG Academy\\". It delivers both academics and athletics. Programs =Bollettieri tennis= The Bollettieri tennis program offers year-round tennis camps ranging from one to five weeks in length and is led by director Rohan Goetzke. The campus has 35 outdoor hard courts, 5 indoor hard courts, and 16 green clay courts. In 1987, thirty-two academy students or former students were in the Wimbledon draw and twenty-seven were in the U.S. Open. Famous past students include Andre Agassi, Monica Seles, Jim Courier, Kei Nishikori, Anna Kournikova, Serena Williams, and Maria Sharapova. =Football= IMG announced the John Madden Football Academy in March 2010 and held its first camp from June 4–6, 2010. The football program offers a residency program and year-round camps ranging from three days to five weeks in length and was previously led by former NFL quarterback Chris Weinke. The academy fielded a high school football team for the first time in 2013. In 2013, MaxPreps called IMG Academy the \\"nation's top high school football facility.\\" IMG Academy named Kevin Wright the head coach in spring 2015 after Weinke accepted a position as quarterbacks coach with the Los Angeles Rams. Wright guided the program to its first undefeated regular season (9–0) in 2015. Earnest Byner, the running backs coach is featured in NFL Undiscovered which, since 2016, has featured overseas prospects who have little or no prior knowledge of the game. =Soccer= IMG Academy offers an Academy soccer program and year-round soccer camps. IMG Academy was home to U.S. Soccer's full-time residency program for the United States' U-16 and U-17 men's national teams. Started in 1999 and closed in 2017, it was integral in developing the United States' top youth soccer prospects. The original idea of the residency program was to give elite players the opportunity to train in a professional environment as most MLS clubs did not have a substantial youth academy system in place prior to 2009. The Bradenton Academy has grown from an initial 20 players to 30 in 2002 and then to 40 in 2003. The program is now split into a U-16 squad and a U-17 squad. A typical day for the student- athlete at Bradenton consists of academic classes in the morning followed by sports training in the afternoon. Students at the academy take accelerated courses and graduate high school a year early, making the players who do not turn pro immediately some of the most heavily recruited prospects in college soccer. The academy can trace its roots back to Project 2010 which highlighted ways U.S. Soccer could make the senior men's national team a legitimate threat to win the World Cup by the end of the decade. Two programs that were born from Project 2010 were Generation Adidas (previously called Project-40) and the Bradenton Academy. The academy was started in January 1999 with the backing of IMG and Nike, but was closed in 2017 due to the proliferation of U.S. Development Academy programs. =Baseball= IMG Academy has an Academy baseball program and year-round camps, in addition to summer Wood Bat Leagues. =Basketball= IMG Academy's post graduate program played in their only appearance in the 2016 National Prep Championship in New Haven, Connecticut. Among the teams were Brewster Academy, DME Academy, Elev-8 Sports Institute, Fork Union Military Academy, Hargrave Military Academy, IMG Academy, Northfield Mount Hermon School, and more. The head coach of IMG's national high school team is Sean McAloon, who previously was the head coach at St. John's College High School in Washington, D.C. Its basketball alumni include Dallas Mavericks forward Dwight Powell and Orlando Magic forward Jonathan Isaac, the 6th overall pick of the 2017 NBA draft. In 2017, IMG Academy had its first two selections to the McDonald's All American Game, Trevon Duval was selected to the boys game and Rellah Boothe was selected to the girls game. In 2018, Anfernee Simons would enter directly from the academy to the 2018 NBA Draft, being the second player in the academy's history to do so and the third overall player to be drafted directly out of the high school. During the preparation for the 2017 NBA Draft, the IMG Academy hosted their first ever draft combine. The Professional Basketball Combine would be held as an alternative (mainly for seniors) to measure their abilities and potentially give them the chance to enter the NBA, if not allow them the chance to play in the NBA G League or even overseas, with nearly every participant that year doing exactly that. Currently, four players that participated in the event signed two-way contracts to enter the NBA properly, with eight of them going overseas and 11 players entered the G League. The event would be held once again in 2018, gaining more popularity that year with the participation of former UCLA player and current professional player LiAngelo Ball. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire WNBA 2020 season is being held there. Under a plan approved on June 15, the shortened 22-game regular season would be held without fans present. =Golf= IMG Academy has a golf program and offers summer camps. The students and camp participants play on three golf courses Sara Bay Country Club, IMG Academy Golf Club and Palm Aire Golf Club. IMG's practice facilities include a double sided range, two putting greens and two chipping greens which is open to golf students most of the day. =Lacrosse= IMG Academy has an Academy lacrosse program and year-round camps. IMG Academy launched a high school team in 2012, featuring a new women's program made in 2018. Notable alumni include Tehoka Nanticoke, Marc-Antoine Pion, Zack Pinney and Nick Wood. Prior to that, IMG Academy hosted their first full-time lacrosse student-athlete, Matthew Xirinachs, starting in September 2010. Xirinachs went on to join the Drexel Men's Lacrosse Team in the fall of 2011. The women's team hired head coach, Jeff McGuigan in July 2019. =Track and field and cross country= IMG Academy has an Academy track & field and cross country program and year-round camps.

The station is operated by the NMBS. Entrance hall  History and architecture  The clock at the upper level The original terminal station building was constructed between 1895 and 1905 as a replacement for the first terminus of the Brussels-Mechelen-Antwerp railway. The stone-clad building was designed by Louis Delacenserie. The viaduct into the station is also a notable structure designed by local architect Jan Van Asperen. A plaque on the north wall bears the name Middenstatie, an expression now antiquated in Dutch. The station is widely regarded as the finest example of railway architecture in Belgium, although the extraordinary eclecticism of the influences on Delacenserie's design had led to a difficulty in assigning it to a particular architectural style. In W. G. Sebald's novel Austerlitz an ability to appreciate the full range of the styles that might have influenced Delacenserie is used to illustrate the brilliance of the fictional architectural historian who is the novel's protagonist. Owing to the vast dome above the waiting room hall, the building became colloquially known as the \\"spoorwegkathedraal\\" (\\"railroad cathedral\\"). In 2009 the American magazine Newsweek judged Antwerpen-Centraal the world's fourth greatest train station.Jaime Cunningham, \\"Stations: A Destination That Matches the Journey\\", Newsweek, New York, 10 January 2009. In 2014 the British-American magazine Mashable awarded Antwerpen-Centraal the first place for the most beautiful railway station in the world.Dennis Green, \\"All Aboard! 12 Beautiful Railway Stations From Around the World\\", Mashable, New York, 25 August 2014. =Train hall= The originally iron and glass train hall (185 metres long and 44 metres or 43 metres high) was designed by Clément Van Bogaert, an engineer, and covers an area of 12,000 square metres. The height of the station was once necessary for the smoke of steam locomotives. The roof of the train hall was originally made of steel. World War II damage and restoration During World War II, severe damage was inflicted to the train hall by the impact of V-2 rockets, without destroying the structural stability of the building, according to the National Railway Company of Belgium. Nevertheless, it has been claimed that the warping of the substructure due to a V-2 impact had caused constructional stresses. The impact remains visible due to a lasting wave-distortion in the roofing of the hall. Visible wave-distortion in the roof of the train hall of the Antwerp Central Station (Antwerpen-Centraal), as seen from the roof of an adjacent building in the Pelikaansstraat (near the corner with De Keyserlei) on 13 September 2016. The warping of the structure can be seen at the far top-right end of the roof here. In the mid-twentieth century, the building's condition had deteriorated to the point that its demolition was being considered. The station was closed on 31 January 1986 for safety reasons, after which restoration work to the roof (starting at the end of March 1986 and finishing in September 1986) and façades was performed. The stress problems due to the impact of bombs during the war were reportedly solved by the use of polycarbonate sheets instead of glass, due to its elasticity and its relatively low weight (40% less than glass), which avoided the need for extra supporting pillars. After replacing or repairing steel elements, they were painted burgundy. Copper was also used in the renovation process of the roof.  Expansion for high-speed trains  The different levels In 1998 large-scale reconstruction work began to convert the station from a terminus to a through station. A tunnel was excavated between Antwerpen-Berchem station in the south of the city and Antwerpen-Dam station in the north, passing under Central station, with platforms on two underground levels. This allows Thalys, HSL 4 and HSL-Zuid high-speed trains to travel through Antwerp Central without the need to turn around (the previous layout obliged Amsterdam-Brussels trains to call only at Antwerpen-Berchem or reverse at Central). The major elements of the construction project were completed in 2007, and the first through trains ran on 25 March 2007. This complete project has cost approximately €1.6 billion. The station was awarded a Grand Prix at the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Awards in 2011.http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-11-695_en.htm  Station layout  Station atrium showing the four levels Platform 21 on level -2 Central Station Of Antwerp The station has four levels and 14 tracks arranged as follows: * Level +1: The original station, 6 terminating tracks, arranged as two groups of three and separated by a central opening allowing views of the lower levels * Level 0: Houses ticketing facilities and commercial space * Level −1: 7 m below street level, 4 terminating tracks, arranged in two pairs separated by the central opening. * Level −2: 18 m below street level, 4 through tracks, leading to the two tracks of the tunnel under the city (used by high-speed trains and domestic services towards the north).

It was performed by 200 dancers of various ages, along with several dozen waiting passengers who just jumped in and joined the dance themselves. The video was produced to publicize Op zoek naar Maria, the Belgian TV version of the BBC talent competition programme How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?, about the search for an actress to play the lead role in a stage revival of The Sound of Music. The station is used in Agatha Christie's Poirot episode \\"The Chocolate Box\\" to represent a station in Brussels. The beginning of Austerlitz, the final novel of the German writer W. G.

David Malcomson traded under his own name until 1818, when the firm became known as David Malcomson & Sons. At this point, he held an interest in four corn stores in Clonmel and in the Corporation Mill on Little Island. He had also built or acquired (it is not known) the family home called Melview in Kellets Lane. At some stage, probably in connection with the corn business, David started a jute factory at Carrick, but this venture was short- lived. In 1820 he leased further land on Little Island for corn mill extensions and in 1824 took over the lease of the Pouldrew mill from the Wyse family, presumably also for corn milling. (Newtown School in Waterford used to be the residence of the Buonaparte-Wyse family before it was taken over by the Society of Friends in 1798). Pouldrew mill, which is joined by a short canal to the river Suir, was managed by one of the younger sons, David Malcomson junior. Driving between Clonmel and Pouldrew, David Malcomson senior and his eldest son Joseph used to notice the water of the river Clodagh where they crossed the bridge at Portlaw, and the pre-existing mill there having been burned down, they took over the property on a 999-year lease. Here a big new mill was built, which they were persuaded by a Friend named \\"Capper\\" from Kendal to make a cotton mill, and a house called Mayfield was built alongside it for Joseph. This Mayfield factory became the center of the Malcomson business in southern Ireland.Maria Walsh, Ireland's Secret Millionaires. 2019 The Malcomson's families house, the Mayfield. The Portlaw factory was considerably extended in the 1840s, when the southern block half was added. The processes involved spinning, weaving, bleaching, dying and finally some printing. Numbers employed in the factory reached 1862 and the weekly wage bill was £1000. This expansion may not have been the right police. By 1844 power looms accounted for 75% to 80% of the looms in use in England and the Irish mills working with hand looms were hard put to compete. Despite reductions in wages there was a general decline in employment. The inside of the Mayfield. During the 1832, David Malcomson became involved in another venture, which could well have been pondering when, a few years earlier, Shiel had found his eyes fixed on the river under his feet. His various industrial undertakings spurred him to interest himself in means of promoting commerce, in which transport was always a relevant factor. He and other Clonmel millers were annoyed by the constant raising of freights from Waterford to Liverpool and at the same time were interested in making the Suir navigable as far as Carrick for vessel of 300 tons burden, twice the existing tonnage, so that Carrick merchants could ship direct their own stores. In 1835 David was the principal speaker at a meeting held in Carrick-on-Suir for promoting the River Suir Navigation Company which obtained Parliamentary sanction the following year. The Malcomsons began by chartering steamers, but later became owners themselves. Eventually they built and operated the largest fleet of iron steamers in the world between the mid-1850s and the late-1860s, including five trans-Atlantic passenger liners. One of David’s sons, John Malcomson, looked after this end of the business, living at Waterford in Adelphi Terrace. An account of the history of the involvement of the Malcomson family in shipping from 1836 until the end of the century was printed in The Journal of Commerce and Shipping Telegraph. For twenty-one years, 1837 to 1858, Joseph was in supreme control of the firm of Malcomson Bros.Maria Walsh, Ireland's Secret Millionaires. 2019 The business which had begun with corn mills and stores at Clonmel, Carrick on Suir and Waterford, a calico factory at Clonmel and a cotton factory at Portlaw, inherited from his father, was expanded by him and diversified into other fields of activity. Among these was a jute mill at Carrick which however did not last long, some of its machinery being sold to Denny Bros of Waterford to make bacon wrappers. The main new ventures were shipping (Waterford Steamship Company, St Petersburgh Steamship Company and a major interest in the Cork Steamship Company) and railways (Waterford and Limerick Railway Company). Malcomson Bros became involved with railways round about 1845, when they tried to have the line of the proposed railway to the west diverted from north of the river to one south of it which would have passed through Portlaw.Maria Walsh, Ireland's Secret Millionaires. 2019 An investigation was held and the report of the Board of Trade acquiesced in the Malcomson petition. Despite this, the track was constructed on the other bank. The Malcomsons petitioned the House of Lords and the House of Commons of the United Kingdom but their objection was overruled on the grounds that they were shareholders in the Company. The family operated shipbuilding in Waterford, Ireland. As an offshoot to this, they established the 'Neptune Ironworks', which produced cast iron furniture decorated with metal ferns, and ivy and oak leaves.

It is a partner dance that has been primarily danced socially and sometimes in performances. The follower usually mirrors the steps of the leader, however, in some figures the steps may be completely different, allowing for self-expression and improvisation. Because of the very lively music, the overall style is small sidewise steps with relatively steady upper body and no hip swinging, wiggling or jumping. There are exceptions to this rule, but feel of the zydeco is very real and consistent. Zydeco dance can be described as the opposite of swing or ballroom since the direction or feel of the dance is down, not up like swing or ballroom. Basic step The basic step in zydeco takes 8 beats and consists of two mirrored parts 4 beats each. The step pattern is often memorized as \\"SPSS SPSS\\", \\"S\\" is for \\"step\\", \\"P\\" is for pause. After mastering the basic rhythm, one may replace simple weight transfers by very small steps to shuffle in place or just a little sideways or the couple may rotate in either direction, usually in the clockwise direction. Another way to start learning that for some is simpler is to keep time with music, and track the weight shifts is using the cues - slow, quick quick. The pattern therefore is for the leader (opposite foot for follower) to transfer weight to left foot saying slow (2 beats, 1,2) and then quick as you shift onto right foot (1 beat, 3) and then, quick, as you shift back to left foot (1 beat, 4). This repeats on beats 5-8 starting with weight transfer on to right foot, etc.. Once this is mastered it is easy to progress to other skills, including accenting, as discussed below, the second and sixth beats. The slow, quick quick pattern can be seen being taught on the Zydeco Dance Lesson YouTube link below. After mastering the basic rhythm, one may replace simple weight transfers by very small steps to shuffle in place or just a little sideways or the couple may rotate in either direction, usually in the clockwise direction. Finally, the lively zydeco music with its accented 2nd (and 6th) beats will force you to do something rather than simply \\"pause\\" on counts 2 and 6. Usual \\"fill-ins\\" are kicks, toe or heel taps, flicks, brush, etc. with the free (unweighted) foot or a little twist on the weighted foot. These actions are commonly known as \\"eat-a-beat\\". There can also be a pulse on these second and sixth beats; by bending the knee, dropping the butt, etc., ... and these accents can be strong or subtle depending on the inclination of the dancer and the feeling of the music.

Graham Stadium is a 7,500-seat multi-purpose stadium in Martin, Tennessee.World Stadiums - Stadiums in the United States: Tennessee It is home to the University of Tennessee at Martin Skyhawks football team. The facility opened in 1964. It is located north of Tennessee State Route 431 (University Avenue, formerly Highway 22) from the central campus area, adjacent to the Agricultural Experiment Station. Namesake of the stadium The stadium is named in honor of Hardy M. Graham, a long-time supporter on UT Martin, who has contributed over $1 million to the university. The naming of the stadium took place on July 19, 2001.http://www.utm.edu/departments/univrel/pdfs/Buildings_002.doc Previous to this, the stadium had been referred to as Pacer Stadium after a former athletic team nickname (1971-1995). The actual playing surface is H. K. Grantham Field after a prior athletics coach at the school. The stadium is located on Everett Derryberry Lane, also named in honor of a former coach, the school's first in football. Facility The stadium's capacity is 7,500. Of those, nearly 1,900 of the seats are chairback. Berms located beyond the south end zone give the stadium a \\"bowled\\" look. The stadium's press box consists of two levels. The first accommodates working media and coaches. The second level houses the public address announcer, scoreboard operator, coaches, filming deck and the Chancellor's box, which seats 25 guests. The current playing surface is FieldTurf, which was installed prior to the 2008 season, replacing natural Bermuda grass. Renovations The State of Tennessee provided funding to construct a modern ROTC facility on the east side of the stadium, replacing an obsolete frame building which had been moved to the central campus area after World War II. With the assistance of private and public funding, the chairback seating was added. Improvements also included complete restroom and concession facilities on the east side of the stadium, improved west side seating and press box additions. In, 2013 it was planned that the facility undergo a $5.5 million renovation project to replace its entire west side with new bleacher seating and add a four-story building featuring a club level, academic support level, and press box that totalled approximately 21,000 square feet. The building was to stretch 50 yards—from 25-yard line to 25-yard line.

The text comprises five words: (Lord our God), which are repeated for the first ten sections, resolved by a chorus of (Have mercy on us) in the eleventh and final section. Both lines of text are sung as imploring pleas. A typical performance lasts 35 minutes. Górecki composed the work in 1981 in protest to government intervention against the Polish Solidarity trade union - specifically, in response to the government- sanctioned assault of activists in Bydgoszcz. After martial law was enacted in December of that year, performance of the piece became impossible, and the piece was not performed until 1987.Thomas, Adrian. Polish Music since Szymanowski. Cambridge, 2005, p. 262. The first performance took place on 10 September 1987 in St. Stanisłaus Church Włocławek, and a day later in Bydgoszcz, with Stanisław Krawczyński conducting the Bydgoszcz Philharmonic Choir. Background Henryk Górecki dedicated his Miserere to the city of Bydgoszcz. Bydgoszcz was the site of a confrontation between members of the opposition organizations Solidarity and Rural Solidarity (which were made up of an estimated one-third of the Polish population) and the Polish militia. At around ten past seven on 19 March 1981, approximately two hundred militia, sent in to remove the organizations from a prolonged negotiation with the Provisional Council, violently assaulted the organizations’ members. In the confrontation, one was left with contusions to the skull and ribs, and suspected brain damage; two others were seriously injured, inflaming an already unhappy Polish populace. Nine months after the incident in Bydgoszcz, the opposition organizations was outlawed and General of the Army Wojciech Jaruzelski declared a state of martial law. During this period, no performance of the work was possible, and Górecki placed the completed work out of sight. He revised the work in 1987 before its premiere in Włocławek on September 10, 1987 at the 15th Bydgoszcz Music Festival. Włocławek had been the site of the 1984 assassination of the priest Jerzy Popiełuszko by state police and made a fitting scene for the performance of a work dedicated to those so violently oppressed by their government. Promotion of the premiere was prohibited by the authorities, but every seat ended up occupied. After his Third Symphony of 1976, Górecki was to embrace smaller-scale musical forms, such as short unaccompanied choral works (e.g. Broad Waters, Op. 39, his Five Marian songs, Op. 54) and chamber works; Miserere was to be the only large-scale work within the 1980s, reminiscent of his 2nd and 3rd symphonies in compositional scale and performer numbers. At the same time, his music became both harmonically and melodically simpler in his writing than his previous serial compositions. Three primary musical influences also became apparent in his compositional style: Polish folksong, Catholic chant and the Polish music of the past, primarily the works of Karol Szymanowski. Out of these influences evolved two compositional kernels in Górecki’s music: Górecki’s “motto” motif (a rise of a minor third, usually on the first three pitches of the Aeolian or Dorian scales); and the “Skierkowski turn” (the Górecki motto followed by a descending half-step) named for the Polish folk music collector who influenced the music of Karol Szymanowski.Thomas, Adrian. \\"Intense Joy and Profound Rhythm: An Introduction to the Music of Henryk Mikołaj Górecki . Retrieved on 3 March 2009. Górecki’s motto and turn are essential motivic elements in the Miserere. In fact, the very first notes of the work are the motto and turn in A Aeolian (pitches A-B-C-B) sung in unison by the Bass II’s. There is also an abundance of sacred musical influence at play in the Miserere. The monodic opening is based on traditional Polish chant. The following two-part section with the added Bass I reflects the two-part sacred singing common in Polish religious services. The repetitive nature of each of the simple melodies is yet another example of chant influence. Finally, Górecki’s indication for a minimum of 120 singers in the chorus evokes the sound of congregational singing.  Structure  Like many other of his compositions, Górecki indicates the performance duration of the Miserere. The 37 minute-long work for large mixed choir is essentially all in A Aeolian in an arch form. It builds in intensity to a climactic point and then returns. Górecki composed the Miserere for eight voice parts (Sopranos I+II, Altos I + II, Tenors I+II, Bass I+II) with an additive structure. This means each vocal entrance is added over top of parts already present. Górecki scholar Adrian Thomas calls these sections “paragraphs.”Thomas, Adrian. Górecki. Oxford: Clarendon Press; New York: Oxford University Press, 1997. p. 103 Each section builds on the preceding paragraph but have their own distinctive character. Miserere Op. 44, contains 11 sections delineated by the composer through approximate performance durations for each section. The first section begins with the second basses with the next highest part. The only departure from this formula is in Section 8 when Gorecki holds the expected first soprano entrance until Section 9.Gorecki, Henryk Mikolaj. \\"Miserere op. 44.\\" Krakow: Polskie Wydawnictowo Muzyczne, 1990. The first ten sections are sung to the text \\"Domine Deus noster\\", with the last section sung to \\"MISERERE NOBIS\\", bolded in Górecki's own hand. Throughout the whole piece only white-key notes are used, with a strong reliance on the interval of the third. Sections 2-6 all involve chords generally built on stacked thirds, most notably 9th chords on A in the 4th-6th section. The 7th section is noticeably simpler in texture and harmony; the Alto, Tenor and Bass hold an E for nearly the whole movement as the Sop II sing a cantus. Throughout the whole piece, Górecki marks the term 'błagalnie' (imploringly), a commentary on the text - in itself from the Psalms (Ps. 105:47) and the Agnus Dei of the Roman Rite. The 8th section, a gigantic fortissimo section, never resolves itself - it cadences on its own dominant, G, and never resolves into the tonic, avoiding any sense of victory. This is reflective of the fact that Górecki never meant the Miserere to be triumphant, given the context that it was written in. The final and eleventh section, is quiet, yet 'błagalnie'; it returns to the A Aeolian mode after a shift in tonal center (to E in the 7th section, to C in the 8th), hammering out the same A minor chords only with slight shifts in the melodic line. Throughout the last section, each melodic part moves by at most a four-note range, but the harmonic range is static. He solves the issue of sticking only with white keys by using a IV43 chord, in place of a dominant chord which would require the use of a G-sharp. The repeated meditation of the A minor \\"MISERERE NOBIS\\" chords gives the piece a finality that would otherwise have been problematic.

Clan MacQuarrie (also MacQuarie, McQueary, McQuary, MacQuaire, MacGuarie, Macquarie, McCreary) is an ancient Highland Scottish clan which owned the islands of Ulva, Staffa and Gometra as well as large tracts of land on the Isle of Mull, which are all located in the Scottish Inner Hebrides. Clan MacQuarrie (Scottish Gaelic for: son of Guaire) is one of the seven Siol Alpin clans descended from the Kings of the Picts and Dál Riata. Clan MacQuarrie is one of the four oldest Highland clans and can trace its ancestry to 9th century Kenneth MacAlpine, the first King of Scots. A 1450 manuscript describes the descent of Clan MacQuarrie from their namesake progenitor Guaire (Scottish Gaelic for: noble), brother of Fingon (ancestor of Clan MacKinnon) and Anrias (ancestor of Clan Gregor). They were fierce fighters in the Wars of Scottish Independence and fought in support of King Robert the Bruce at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. The MacQuarrie Modern tartan. History A Victorian era depiction of a member of the clan by R. R. McIan, from The Clans of the Scottish Highlands, published in 1845. This Sampler was made by Thisbe Danson in 1832. She was great granddaughter to Lachlan MacQuarrie, XVI & last Chief of the Clan MacQuarrie. Clan MacQuarrie is first found in possession of the island of Ulva in the Scottish Inner Hebrides, and followed the Lords of the Isles. The first record of Clan MacQuarrie is of the chief John Macquarrie of Ulva, who died in 1473.Maclauchlan & Wilson & Keltie, pp. 262-265 John's son, Dunslaff, was the chief of the clan during the forfeiture of the Lord of the Isles, after which the MacQuarries gained independence as a small, respected clan surrounded by a powerful ally in Clan MacLean.Skene, vol. 2, pp. 263-264. Following the fall of the Lordship of the Isles the clan followed Maclean of Dowart, and with the Macleans, the MacQuarries supported Domhnall Dubh's quest for the Lordship of the Isles at the beginning of the 16th century. In 1504 MacGorry of Ullowaa, along with other chiefs, was summoned to answer for aiding in Domhnall Dubh's failed rebellion. The clan suffered grievously at the Battle of Inverkeithing on 20 July 1651, where they fought on the side of Charles II of England against an English Parliamentarian army led by John Lambert. During the battle many Scots deserted, and the remaining Scots were decisively defeated by the well-disciplined New Model Army of the English. Amongst the slain were Allan Macquarrie of Ulva, chief of Clan MacQuarrie, and most of his followers. Clan MacQuarrie currently does not have a chief. The last chief of Clan MacQuarrie was Lauchlan Macquarrie of Ulva. MacQuarrie was head of the clan when Samuel Johnson and James Boswell visited Ulva in 1773. Debts to creditors forced the last chief to sell off his lands; and in 1778, at the age of 63, he joined the British Army. The chief then served in the American Revolutionary War, and died at the age of 103 on 14 January 1818.Smibert gives Lachlan Macquarrie's age on joining the Army as 62, and his date of death 1817 aged 102. Maclauchlan & Wilson & Keltie give his age on joining the Army at 63, and his date of death as 1818, aged 103. The last chief and his wife Alice Maclean, daughter of Donald Maclean, 5th Laird of Torloisk, Isle of Mull, had eight children - four sons and four daughters. Three of his sons joined the British Army and died without issue; the only one to have children was his third son Donald, who was born around 1745. In July 1761, Donald was commissioned as one of the junior Ensigns in the Fencible Men of Argyllshire. After discharge from the army he moved to Liverpool, and on 28 October 1790 married Martha Lea at St Nicholas Church, Liverpool. They had one daughter, as recorded in a manuscript genealogy found amongst the papers of Lt. Colonel Charles MacQuarrie. It was compiled during the lifetime of the last Chief and because of certain births that are mentioned it was written sometime between 28 March 1816 and 14 January 1818. It states that Donald \\"follows the seafaring business and has one daughter who is married, in Liverpool, to the master of a trading vessel, who is employed in the foreign trade.\\" Furthermore, the Liverpool Directory for the year 1818 describes Donald as \\"a Mariner, of 13 Ansdell Street, Liverpool.\\" The above-mentioned daughter, and thus granddaughter of Lauchlan MacQuarrie the XVI and last Chief of the clan, was called Agnes MacQuarrie and she was married on 28 January 1816 at Holy Trinity Church, Liverpool, to Captain William Danson, Master of the Frances, a ship named after his mother, and later Master of the Thisbe of Liverpool. A record of their marriage was published in the Monthly Magazine Vol. 41, 1816 - \\"Capt. William Danson of Workington to Miss McQuarrie of Liverpool\\". On 6 April 1824, the Thisbe of Liverpool was reported to have sailed from Liverpool to Quebec, but it never arrived. The wreck of the Thisbe was reported in the Montreal Gazette on 24 Sep 1824: \\"A Jolly Boat with Thisbe of Liverpool on the stern, was picked up by the Margaret Ann, arrived at Miramichi, in longitude 36. The boat was bottom up. This vessel, it is stated sailed from Liverpool in April last with a very valuable cargo for Montreal and has not since been heard of.\\" Captain William Danson, his wife Agnes, née MacQuarrie, and four of their children perished on this journey, but their daughter Thisbe Danson (who was born at sea and named after the ship) survived and had issue, with descendants living today in the UK (Lancashire & Cumbria) and Pennsylvania, USA. Donald MacQuarrie of Ansdell Street was buried in Liverpool on 10 June 1821 aged 75, and his wife Martha on 16 December 1827 aged 71. A large portion of the ancient patrimonial property was repurchased by Major-General Lachlan Macquarie, brother of Lt. Colonel Charles MacQuarrie (see above) and Governor of New South Wales, and from whom Port Macquarie and Macquarie Island in the South Pacific derive their names. On 16 July 1804 both Lachlan MacQuarrie, the last Chief of the Clan, and his son Donald were present at the \\"christening\\" of Jarvisfield, the estate belonging to Major General Lauchlan Macquarie on the Isle of Mull. Governor Lachlan's mother and the last Chief were half- cousins. They both shared Lachlan MacQuarrie, the XIV Chief, as grandfather, but descended from different wives. Today, the clan MacQuarrie is very much alive with an active society of global members. Since nobody has claimed to be the next Chief for almost 200 years now, the chiefdom has lain dormant. The current heir is a descendant of Thisbe Danson. The Coat of Arms belonging to the Chief of the MacQuarries of Ulva is on display at Macquarie University in honour of Lachlan Macquarie.

He composed well-known pieces for the marimba such as \\"Yellow After the Rain\\" and \\"Sea Refractions\\"; it is said that these works were composed because Peters felt that there was a lack of musically interesting material that would introduce his students to four-mallet marimba techniques. Biography Peters began his career in the United States Army Symphony Orchestra. He later was principal percussionist of the Dallas Symphony before taking the principal percussion position in the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1969. When principal timpanist William Kraft retired in 1981 to pursue his career as a composer, Peters stepped up to assume the role as timpanist, a position he occupied through the Los Angeles Philharmonic's 2005/2006 season. Peters was well known for his prodigious sight reading ability. Peters became the applied percussion teacher at California State University Los Angeles shortly after joining the LA Philharmonic. During his tenure as timpanist, he took the position as professor of percussion at the University of California, Los Angeles. In May 2012, Peters retired from teaching. Peters was also a member of the Philharmonic New Music Group and recorded a wide array of contemporary works as a chamber musician. Peters held the Performer's Certificate and bachelor's and master's degrees from the Eastman School of Music, where he studied with William Street. While at Eastman, he was a member of the original \\"Marimba Masters.\\" Upon graduation, he served as timpanist with the 7th U.S. Army Symphony Orchestra. As a widely published author and composer, Peter's works and instructional materials are highly regarded throughout the United States and abroad. He owned and operated a music publishing company that handled percussion works exclusively. His faculty positions included the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara from 1990–2002, and UCLA, where he taught percussion and conducted the percussion ensemble. In 2006 he was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Sabian Cymbal Company. After a year of declining health, Peters died on October 28, 2017, at the age of 82. In a newspaper article announcing his death, symphonic conductor James Touchi- Peters- who was also Peters' cousin- was quoted as saying, \\"It's not an exaggeration to say that Mitch Peters was among the dozen best timpanists in the world.\\" In a letter to Peters, the late conductor and percussionist Frederick Fennell wrote, \\"I may make music long enough to run into a better percussionist than you, but I doubt it very much.\\" Compositions = Solo Works =  Trombone  * Rondo for Solo Trombone (pub. 1972)  Marimba  * Sonata-Allegro, marimba and piano (pub. 1968) [Grade 3+] * Chant, marimba (2 mallets) (pub. 1971) [Grade 3] * Sea Refractions, marimba (4 mallets) (pub. 1971) [Grade 3] * Theme and Variations, marimba (2–4 mallets) and piano (pub. c. 1971) [Grade 4] *Yellow After the Rain, marimba (4 mallets) (pub. 1971) [Grade 4+] * Zen Wanderer, marimba (4 mallets) (pub. 1972) [Grade 3] * Teardrops, marimba (4 mallets) (pub. 1975) [Grade 3] * Undercurrent, marimba (4 mallets) (pub. 1975) [Grade 3] * Waves, marimba (4 mallets) (pub. 1975) [Grade 3] * Three Pieces for Three Mallets, marimba (3 mallets) (pub. 1978) [Grade 3] *Dog Beach, marimba (4 mallets) (pub. 1999) [Grade 3] *Galactica, marimba (2 mallet) (pub. 1999) [Grade 3+] *Pastiche, marimba (4 mallets) (pub. 1999) [Grade 3] *Starscape, marimba (4 mallets) (pub. 1999) [Grade 3] *Barcelona, marimba (4 mallets) (pub. 2000) [Grade 3]  Timpani  * Scherzo for Three Timpani (1 player) (pub. 1968) [Grade 3] * Rondino, 4 timpani (1 player) (pub. 1970) [Grade 3] * Tribal Serenade, 4 timpani (1 player) (pub. 1971) [Grade 3] * The Storm (Silence is Golden), 4 timpani (1 player) (pub. 1975) [Grade 4] * Primal Mood, 4 timpani (1 player) (pub. 1972) [Grade 3]  Multi-Percussion  * Etude #I, 4 tom-toms (1 player) (pub. 1967) [Grade 3] * Rondo, tom-tom solo (4 tom-toms) (1 player) (pub. 1968) [Grade 3] * Passacaglia and Trio, multiple percussion solo (1 player) (pub. 1971) [Grade 3] *Perpetual Motion, snare drum and 4 tom-toms (1 player) (pub. 1971) [Grade 3] = Percussion Ensemble = * March of the Eagles, 5 percussionists (pub. 1967) *A la nañigo, percussion ensemble (5 players) (pub. 1967) *Study in 5/8, percussion quartet (pub. 1967) [Grade 3] *A la samba, 6 percussionists (pub. 1969) [Grade 3+] *Piece for Percussion (4 players)(pub March 27, 1969) = Method Book = *Odd Meter Rudimental Etudes, snare drum, educational work (pub. 1967) *Stick Control for the Drum Set, Volume 1: Basic Triplet Patterns, educational work (pub. 1967) *Etude #II, (1 player) (pub. 1968) [Grade 3] *Introduction and Waltz, (1 player) (pub. 1968) [Grade 2] *Developing Dexterity for Snare Drum, educational work (pub. 1968) *Drum Music to March By, educational work (pub. 1968) *Stick Control for the Drum Set, Volume 2: Basic Sixteenth Patterns, educational work (pub. 1969) *Advanced Snare Drum Studies, educational work (pub. 1971) *Odd Meter Calisthenics for the Snare Drummer, educational work (pub. 1973) *Intermediate Snare Drum Studies (43 studies), educational work (pub. 1976) *Intermediate Timpani Studies, educational work (pub. 1981) *Hard Times: 20 advanced etudes for snare drum, educational work (pub. 1984) *Elementary Snare Drum Studies, educational work (pub. 1988) *Rudimental Primer for the Snare Drummer, educational work (pub. 1990) *Fundamental Method for Timpani, educational work (pub. by Alfred, 1993) *Fundamental Method for Mallets, educational work (pub. by Alfred, 1995) *Fundamental Method for Mallets, Book 2, educational work (pub. by Alfred, 1996) *Fundamental Solos for Timpani: 15 intermediate-level solos for the developing timpanist, educational work (pub. by Alfred, 1997) *Fundamental Solos for Mallets, educational work (1999) *Etudes for Snare Drum, educational work (pub. 2003) [Advanced] References External links  American percussionists classical percussionists 1935 births 2017 deaths American composers ","title":"Mitchell Peters"},{"id":"5722588","text":"Frequencies from Planet Ten is the debut album by rock band Orange Goblin.

History The hamlet of Little Woodham was initially created in 1984 as a temporary reenactment of village life on the eve of the English Civil War by members of The English Civil War Society as part of their enactment of the fictional Battle Of Stokes Bay. Following this, Society volunteers continued the exhibition during the summers of 1984 and 1985. When the English Civil War Society announced they would be unable to continue, local residents formed the Gosport Living History Society to take over the running of the village to preserve it as an educational resource and tourist attraction. The Gosport Borough Council provided much of the financing and administration until 1995 when the Gosport Living History Society became a registered charity and took on sole responsibility for funding and administration, and in 2007, Little Woodham won the \\"Best Leisure & Tourism Venue\\" in the \\"Go Gosport\\".

The trail begins at the La Luz Trailhead and proceeds approximately eight miles to either Sandia Crest or the Sandia Peak Tramway. The hike is strenuous, with of elevation gain and a grade of 12%. The trail allows hikers to view the flora and fauna of four climatic zones and the granite cliffs and spires native to the west face of the Sandia Mountains. It also offers excellent views of Albuquerque, the cinder cones of the Albuquerque Volcanoes, and Mount Taylor. The La Luz Trail is also home to the La Luz Trail Run. Location The La Luz Trail is located in the northwestern part of the Sandia range. It can be accessed from Sandia Crest, the Sandia Peak Tramway, or the La Luz Trailhead. The La Luz Trailhead is accessed by taking the Forest Road 333 turnoff from Tramway Road (NM 556). Trail information View from Sandia Crest of the La Luz Trail, in the rockslide switchbacks The trail originates at the La Luz Trailhead, which has an elevation of . The lower reaches of the trail are a wide dirt path that climbs at a moderate slope. This part of the trail passes through the Upper Sonoran Zone, where juniper and piñon trees, prickly pear cactus, and cholla cactus are found. About a mile from the trailhead is the junction of La Luz Trail and the Tramway trail. The Tramway trail connects to the lower tram terminal, and allows hikers to use the tram to return to their vehicles instead of hiking the round trip. As the trail climbs the mountain, the scrub forest is replaced by the alpine forest of the Transition Zone, with ponderosa pines, blue spruce trees, and assorted wildflowers in the summer months. A scenic overlook is found at around and a distance of about . Just past this overlook is a sign that warns hikers that the trail beyond is snowy and impassable in the winter months. The trail becomes narrower and more rocky after the overlook. The trail travels through a steep, rocky draw with the many quaking aspen and pines of the Canadian Zone. Hikers traverse 19 switchbacks in this area as they near the top of the trail. Approximately from the trailhead, the La Luz trail forks. The right (south) fork leads to the Sandia Peak Tramway and a final elevation of . The left (north) fork is the Crest Spur Trail (Trail 84) and travels approximately up a very steep slope to Sandia Crest and a final elevation of . Trail conditions and precautions Winter warning sign The La Luz trail is a strenuous day hike, especially if hikers are attempting to hike up and down the trail. Often, hikers will turn around at a set point on the trail or use the tram to only hike one way on the trail. It is recommended that all hikers be in the appropriate physical condition for their desired trip length, and to take the necessary equipment including severe weather clothing. The La Luz trail is well-worn due to the large number of hikers it receives. However, it is possible to lose the trail, as there have been some relocations of switchbacks. In the winter months, the area above the sign is very snowy, and requires snowshoes and trekking poles for passage. The trail is subject to closure due to extreme fire danger in the hot summer months. The Sandia Ranger District provides a website that has a page of current trail conditions such as ice and snow. La Luz Trail run The La Luz Trail has been the site of a trail race up its slopes since 1965. After the designation of the Sandia Mountains as a wilderness area in the 1970s, the race was limited to 400 participants by the Forest Service. These slots are filled by lottery. The run is nine miles (14 km) in length, beginning with on Forest Road 333 and finishing at Sandia Crest after running of the trail. This run was honored as one of the \\"12 Most Grueling Trail Races in North America\\" by the fall 2001 issue of Trail Runner Magazine.

In Australia, an Avenue of Honour is a memorial avenue of trees, with each tree symbolising a person. The tradition, which originated in the Goldfields region of Victoria, Australia, is an important part of Australian culture. There are 547 known avenues of honour in Australia, in all states and territories except the Northern Territory. Over half are in Victoria. Most avenues are in remembrance of those who fought or died in war, particularly World War I (1914–1918), although the earliest recorded avenues were planted in remembrance of Australia's participation in the Second Boer War (1899-1902).Megan Backhouse, \\"Felled but not forgotten\\", The Saturday Age, 8 June 2013, p. 10 Since soldiers were grouped by the place they were recruited, a military defeat often meant all of the men of eligible age from the town were killed in the same battle. Many of the avenue's trees include metal plaques naming the victims. Many of these avenues now feature large, established trees and exotic species. Several of these avenues are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register; most others are afforded local levels of heritage protection through the various Local government in Australia and the National Trust of Australia; however, many such avenues have since been affected by road development. An online project titled \\"Avenues of Honour 1915-2015\\" (www.avenuesofhonour.org) has been established by Treenet, the urban tree research and education organisation based at the University of Adelaide's Waite Arboretum.

Considered to be a masterpiece of post-war architecture, it was bombed and heavily damaged during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999. Today, only a small non-damaged portion of the building is used by the Ministry of Defence of Serbia. History The building was built between 1957 and 1965 and it was designed by Serbian architect, Nikola Dobrović. It is divided by Nemanjina Street, and its design is meant to resemble a canyon of the Sutjeska river, where one of the most significant battles of World War II in Yugoslavia was fought, with the street as a river dividing the two monumental, gradually completed tracts. As Nemanjina Street comes up the hill from the main railway station, the two parts of the building form a symbolic gate. In addition to expressive cascading forms, facades are characterized by the application of contrasting materials - robust, brown-red stone from Kosjerić and white marble slabs from the island of Brač. The most striking visual motif representing the window bars on the facades, designed in the spirit of late modernism. The first part of the building, standing across the government of Serbia building in Kneza Miloša street, is named Building \\"A\\" and has 12,654 square meters. The other part of the building, divided by Nemanjina Street, is named Building \\"B\\" and has 36,581 square meters. =1999 bombing= Around midnight on 29/30 April 1999, 40 days into the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the building was bombed two times by NATO in the space of 15 minutes, because of the structure's significance as a military facility. It was uninhabited at the time it was bombed, leading some to speculate that it was bombed more due to its symbolic significance as a representation of the state, rather than merely just for immediate tangible purposes. It was bombed once again nine days later, around midnight on 7/8 May 1999. =Post- bombing= Severely damaged by the 1999 bombing, the building has not been repaired for over a decade and is Belgrade’s most famous ruin. Since 2005, it has been the protected monument of culture, symbolizing the 1999 NATO bombing and \\"suffering of Serbia\\". Building \\"B\\" was much less damaged during the bombings, and in the following years entrance of the building has been removed, for the safety of the pedestrians. Part of the building \\"B\\" has been used by the Ministry of Defence of Serbia. ;Reconstruction In November 2015, with the budget of 650,000 euros, the first phase of reconstruction of Building \\"A\\" has started, for the purpose of structure collapse prevention. By May 2016, the central part was entirely demolished and the pillars for the part of building close to the street were poured. Around 5,000 square meters was demolished. In February 2017, the government of Serbia has decided to demolish most of the Building \\"A\\" construction with the obligation to re-build it to its original appearance once the country has the funds. This sudden decision was explained with the high cost of the further reconstruction amounting to the estimated 7.66 million euros, while the demolition was estimated at 1.46 million euros. Minister of Defence of Serbia, Zoran Đorđević said that experts advocated for this solution despite already paid first phase of the reconstruction, while the military experts condemned this decision. On 9 March 2017, the Association of Serbian Architects (an informal, private group) launched an initiative for the submission of candidature for the UNESCO World Heritage Site, also saying that the Government of Serbia wanted to remove it from the register of cultural properties, but due to the long legal procedure resorted to the reconstruction. The Association condemned the decision and marked it as a \\"definitive loss of our culture\\" as it is a \\"monument of suffering and brutality of NATO forces\\". In March 2015, on the occasion of the 16th anniversary of the beginning of NATO intervention, the government of Serbia organized a ceremony in front of the ruined building which some observers interpreted as the evidence that the ruin has indeed become a de facto war monument. ;Proposals for other purposes Over the years, there have been talks that the building could be turned into a luxurious hotel of The Trump Organization. Following the reconstruction of Building \\"A\\" and later proposed demolition of the most of the construction, Prime Minister of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić, said that there are plans for the construction of Monument to Stefan Nemanja and Museum of medieval Serbia on the place of the Building \\"A\\".

He was implicated in the May 1979 assassination of United States District Judge John H. Wood Jr. in San Antonio, Texas. Chagra was active as a trafficker in marijuana in the 1970s and at that time was one of the biggest drug traffickers operating out of Las Vegas and El Paso. According to one observer, he was \\"the undisputed marijuana kingpin of the Western world. He imported more high-grade ganja than anyone, tons at a time, planeload after planeload.\\"George Knapp, The pot king of the Western world, Las Vegas City Life, March 29, 2007 Early life Jamiel Chagra, known as Jimmy, was born in El Paso, Texas. He had two brothers, Lee and Joseph, who were both attorneys specializing in the legal defense of drug smugglers, and a sister Patsy. Jimmy got into drug smuggling in 1969 and became one of the largest smugglers in the United States, trafficking drugs from Mexico and Colombia by plane and boat. He had dealings with the Patriarca crime family and Joseph Bonanno, the retired head of the Bonanno crime family. Chagra was also a heavy gambler in Las Vegas, Nevada, and attracted large attention with his flamboyant ways.Jimmy Chagra; Smuggler Linked to Judge's Death Washington Post July 28, 2008No one ran harder, faster through Vegas Las Vegas Review- Journal July 15, 2012 Chagra's drug dealings came under close scrutiny by law enforcement and the judicial system. On November 21, 1978, Assistant U.S. Attorney James Kerr was shot at near his home by two men who fired 19 bullets at his car. Kerr escaped with only minor glass cuts. Kerr had been pursuing Chagra for his drug dealings.Crime Case Widening Ellensburg Daily Record February 22, 1979 On December 23, 1978, Lee Chagra was shot and killed in his law office in El Paso. Lee had been involved with Jimmy in his drug smuggling and the killers took $450,000 that was owed to Joe Bonanno for a drug deal. A few months later, Lou Esper, a small-time drug dealer and acquaintance of Chagra, and two U.S. Army soldiers from Fort Bliss were charged with his murder.3 Held in Killing of Flamboyant Lawyer Washington Post March 5, 1979 Murder of John H. Wood Chagra's downfall began in February 1979 when he was arrested on trafficking charges. He was scheduled to appear before United States District Judge John Wood, a judge who had a reputation for giving out the maximum sentence allowed for drug-related crimes. Chagra faced a possible life sentence without parole if convicted and a law clerk of Wood's told Joe Chagra, Jamiel's brother and attorney, that Judge Wood intended to give Chagra life without parole. Chagra allegedly attempted to bribe Judge Wood for $10 million. Facing life for smuggling, Jimmy Chagra allegedly decided to have the judge killed. Chagra was accused of (and was acquitted of, although he later confessed to conspiracy in a deal to help his wife) hiring hitman Charles Harrelson (actor Woody Harrelson's father) to kill Wood for $250,000; on May 29, 1979, Judge Wood was murdered outside his home by a shot in the back. The authorities did not immediately suspect Chagra of involvement in the assassination. His drug case went to trial and Chagra was found guilty in August 1979 and sentenced to 30 years. Chagra jumped bail, but was captured six months later in Las Vegas.Texas Drug, Gambling Figure Missing; High Bond Forfeited Sarasota Herald-Tribune August 24, 1979 Harrelson was eventually caught and convicted of being the gunman after Chagra talked about the assassination with his brother Joe during Joe's visit to Jimmy in United States Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, after FBI agents placed microphones under the tables they were speaking at. The FBI's position was that even though Joe Chagra was a lawyer, he was talking to his brother as a brother and not an attorney; therefore, their conversations were not covered by attorney-client privilege. Both Harrelson and Chagra's brother Joe were implicated in the assassination. Joe Chagra testified against the other defendants in exchange for pleading guilty to a lesser charge of obstruction of justice with a maximum sentence of ten years in a plea-bargain deal, although with an agreement that he would not testify against his brother Jimmy in a separate trial. Charles Harrelson got two consecutive life terms, Harrelson's wife Jo Ann got 25 years and Jimmy Chagra's wife Elizabeth was also sent to prison for 30 years for delivering the payout money. Jimmy Chagra himself was acquitted of the murder of Judge Wood in front of Judge William S. Sessions, future director of the FBI, although he was found guilty of obstructing justice and conspiring to smuggle drugs. Chagra's lawyer in the case was Oscar Goodman, future Mayor of Las Vegas. In a deal with the federal government, Chagra admitted to his role in the murder of Judge Wood and the attempted murder of Assistant United States Attorney James Kerr. He did this in order to have his wife released before she died and to have him transferred to a medical prison. His wife was never released and she died in custody of ovarian cancer at age 41. Joe Chagra served six and a half years in prison (of his ten-year sentence) and was released. He died in an automobile accident in 1996.Lawrence van Gelder, \\"Joseph Chagra, 50, Lawyer Linked to Assassination, Dies\\", New York Times, December 15, 1996 Later life and death Chagra was released from prison for health reasons in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 9, 2003.

It is owned and operated by Swiss multinational Glencore Inc. The mine was discovered in 1963 by Texas Gulf Sulfur Company. In 1981 it was sold to Canada Development Corporation, then sold in 1986 to Falconbridge Ltd., which in 2006 was acquired by Xstrata, which in turn merged with Glencore in 2013. Ore from the Kidd Mine is processed into concentrate at the Kidd Metallurgical Site, located southeast of the mine, which until 2010 also smelted the ore and refined the metal produced. Following the closure of the majority of the Met Site, concentrate is now shipped to Quebec for processing.Kidd Metallurgical Site Kidd Mine is the world's deepest copper- zinc mine. History An aerial geophysical survey, conducted by Texas Gulf Sulphur Company in March 1959, indicated an anomaly in the Kidd-55 segment warranting ground investigation. A ground electromagnetic survey was conducted in Oct 1963 and a drill rig started drilling a 600-foot core sample in Nov. The core, later confirmed by the Union Assay Office in Salt Lake City, showed an average copper content of 1.15%, an average zinc content of 8.64%, and 3.94 ounces of silver per ton. A second hole was drilled in March 1964, followed by two more in early April. The copper-zinc-silver ore deposit at Kidd Mine discovery was announced in a press release after the board of directors meeting on 16 April 1964. Seven drill holes indicated an ore body 800 feet long, 300 feet wide, and a vertical depth of 800 feet. During the initial exploration of the site, then known as Kidd-55, officers of the company engaged in insider trading in Texas Gulf shares. The ensuing lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission resulted in a landmark decision that established the right of all market participants to have \\"relatively equal access to material information.\\" The mine began ore production in 1966, as an open pit mine and eventually evolved into an underground mine. The mine produces copper, zinc, and several other metals. Geology Open pit at Kidd Mine.

The expansion included the development of three additional production levels and deepening the ramp from the 9100 level to the 9600 level, where the loading pocket is located. This included an extension of the ventilation and backfill systems to the new sections of the mine. The mine's expected production life has since been extended to 2021.

Previous names for the club include Al Ghouta, and Qasioun (named after Mount Qasioun which overlooks the city of Damascus). Ahmed Ezzat Rifai is the original founder of this club. He met with a group of friends in Souq Saruja, Damascus to discuss setting up a new sports club, and they agreed to found the club and named it Qasioun. The club was officially opened in 1928 and hosted a series of sports, including football and weightlifting. The \\"Golden Era\\" Nenad Stavrić is a Serbian coach who joined Al-Wahda club in 2001. He started with two losses against Al-Horriya and Al-Karamah followed with draw with Al-Jaish, the team had to wait until the fifth week of the season to achieve their first win with the new coach. The team finished the league in the third place. In his second year the team had a big improvement In the level of performance especially with the new formation 4–4–2 which was the first time ever a Syrian team to use it, in the beginning the results was awful with the new formation especially the big defeat against the Saudi Arabia champion Al-Ittihad Jeddah seven to nothing in the Arabian club tournament, but after that the team keep improving to win the Syrian Cup in 2003 against Al-Ittihad Aleppo after a dramatic match 5–3. In the next season he made the dream true and Al-Wahda is the 2003–04 Syrian League champion for the first time in the club history, also the team reached the final of AFC Cup and lost against the other Syrian side Al-Jaish after losing the first game 2–3 and winning the second game 1–0. In 2004–05 the team was too close to win the title again but it lost it in the last few weeks with missing a key players along the season with major injury. The curse of injuries continued in the following season but even though the team was closer than the year before to clinch the title. The chairman of the club Khaled Hbobaty decided to replace him with Mansoor Haj Saied and the club entered the black tunnel for several years and remains so to this day.

The term 'Illyro-Roman' can also be used to describe the Roman settlers who colonized Illyricum. Before Rome The Illyrian tribes were considered barbarians by both the Romans and the Hellenic peoples in the southern Balkans. The term Illyrian originally denoted one tribe that lived around Lake Scutari situated along the border of Albania and Montenegro. They were considered among the vast group of barbarian peoples such as the Gauls, Germans, and Dacians. The conquest of Illyria in 168 BC, along with that of Epirus, consolidated the Roman domain over the Adriatic Sea. The mountainous geography of the region meant that the region was hard to subdue, but by 9 CE the Great Illyrian Revolt had been quelled and from then on the region would supply large numbers of non-citizen soldiers to the Roman Auxilia. During the Empire The Romanization of these barbarian peoples eventually transformed them into the most valuable soldiers of the Late Roman Army, with a substantial portion of the officials and generals coming from a northern balkanic background, such as Illyria, Dalmatia, Pannonia and Moesia. One emperor, Decius, several usurpers and during the reign of Gallienus, who started the professionalization of the high command of the army, large numbers of soldiers achieved high rank within the army. They took the place which the Senatorial order had had the privilege of holding since the time of Augustus, 250 years earlier, the command of the legions and armed provinces. Roman colonization Illyricum was heavily colonized by the Romans beginning in the third century BC. The Romans founded the cities of Acruvium, Cibalae, Mursa, Narona, Siscia, and established colonies at Salona, Sirmium, Epidaurum, Aequum, Iader, Rhizon, and in many other cities. These cities were colonized by Roman war veterans. The Illyro-Roman also absorbed other tribes such as the Early Slavs, particularly in the Roman provinces of Dalmatia and Pannonia during the 7th century. The \\"Illyrian emperors\\" It was from this group that the most successful emperors of the time came from and it was they who brought the Crisis of the Third Century to an end. Examples include Claudius II Gothicus, Aurelian, and Probus. There was also the case of Justinian, who was noted for undertaking large-scale political and legislative reform that restructured the Roman empire. He was born in 483 near Skopje to an obscure Illyro-Roman family and became an associate emperor to his uncle, Justin I, who adopted him. The creator of the Tetrarchy Diocletian and his fellow Tetrarchs Maximian, Constantius Chlorus (father of the first Christian emperor Constantine) and Severus II were also of Illyro-Roman background. There are scholars who note that the military spirit and Latin education of the Roman emperors with Illyrian stock often conflicted with the contemporary ideals of an ancient culture, which is based on classical Greek.  Middle Ages  During the Middle Ages, the descendants of the Illyro-Romans have influenced the growth of the Balkan peninsula. It is said that their wandering enterprise facilitated commerce and opened ancient trade routes. These people had access to old Roman road network, which seemed to be known only among themselves. Artifacts excavated (e.g. sepulchral slabs) in Serbia showed Illyro-Roman workmanship that favored decoration that were rude almost to grotesqueness. It is believed that Illyro-Roman inhabitants of this particular site copied the style from their ancient Illyro-Roman predecessors.

It is usually in a network of several workplaces technologically connected (via a private network or the Internet) without regard to geographic boundaries. Employees are thus able to interact in a Collaborative Working Environment regardless of where they are located. A virtual workplace integrates hardware, people, and online processes. History As information technology began to play a greater role in the daily operations of organizations, virtual workplaces developed as an augmentation or alternative to traditional work environments of rooms, cubicles and office buildings. Types of workplaces Individual virtual workplaces vary in how they apply existing technology to facilitate team cooperation: 1\\\\. Telecommuting: the availability and use of communications technologies, such as the Internet, to work in an offsite location. 2\\\\. Hot desking: employees do not have individual desks but are rather each day allocated to a desk where they can access technology services including the Internet, email and computer network files. This is similar to \\"hotelling\\": recognizing that employees spend more time at clients' offices than at the employer's office, they are not assigned a permanent desk. 3\\\\. Virtual team: employees collaborate by working closely together and in regular contact, although physically located in different parts of the world. Drivers There are several factors that drive the interest in using virtual workplaces. = Office space and its cost = Office space has become a major expense for many organisations (and using video technology on platforms such as Skype (at reduced cost) can be a direct substitute of meeting face to face). One response has been to reduce the amount of space each employee occupies. Another is to increase the flexibility of the office’s layout and design. It is not easy to make the most of these approaches and keep employees happy—unless flexible work practices are also used. = Demographic change = There are more women in the workforce, more employees of other nationalities, increased participation from indigenous people and the average age of employees is increasing. These trends are forcing employers to rethink how they employ and manage staff and how they respond to employee interests and demands. = Fuel and energy costs = The expenses of the energy consumption to physically commute are increasing rapidly. Planners and public policymakers share a strong belief that home- based telecommuting with virtual workspace as one of the most sustainable and competitive modes of commuting in terms of travel time and cost, flexibility, and environmental impacts. Benefits Virtual workplaces are advantageous in an information age where technology is expanding rapidly and consumer needs are being met from around the world. A virtual workplace enables individuals to work from any place in the world at any time. This is convenient not only for the employee, but for the consumer as well. For an international organization it fits the need for excellent and timely customer service. Virtual workplaces streamline systems from multiple facets of work into a single unified unit easily accessible by both the consumer and the employee. Decreasing costs as well as increasing efficiency, due to the single system, is an instantaneous advantage. A virtual workplace is easier for employees because it often reduces business travel, consolidates services, and assists in the communication process. Two examples of costs saved by IBM clients' virtual workplace implementation are: * A global technology organization reported savings of $54 million in the first year of integrating the virtual workplace concept into the organization. * An international financial organization estimated savings of over €270 million within five years. Productivity is crucial to any organization. With the implementation of a virtual workplace, productivity may be increased because employees are more focused on business-related projects with only one system to overview. Also, collaborating with team members is made easy with a virtual workplace. With the internet, projects can be completed with increased speed and effectiveness, resulting in saved time. Most important, the needs of consumers are being met with a virtual workplace since it is more convenient for employees to access organizations. Virtual workplaces allow a company to reach more of its employees via meeting workspaces and virtual training sessions. A company may choose to send only a handful of regional managers to a conference it sponsors annually to receive training in a new product. It may then rely on the managers to pass that knowledge on to its employees. Having a virtual training session saves a company money, not only the cost of travel where only a small handful of its employees receive proper training, but in the long run where all of its employees can receive the proper training and be more productive with a sharper learning curve. In addition, the employees can more easily accommodate both personal and professional lives. Challenges Some common challenges are: # Failure to leverage the technology that supports virtual workplaces, resulting in decreased productivity # Lack of human contact could cause decreased team spirit, trust and productivity (and researchers indicate trust is a vital aspect ) # Increased sensitivity to communication, interpersonal and cultural factors # Cultural diversity is not yet achieving the expected benefits See also * Telecommuting References * Dempster, Mike Team - Building key for virtual workplace Retrieved on June 26, 2006 * Powell, Anne Virtual Teams - A review of current literature and directions for future research Retrieved on June 26, 2006 * Yager, Susan Everything's coming up virtual Retrieved on June 26, 2006 * Greenlee, Dana Building a community in the virtual workplace Retrieved on June 26, 2006 * Stephen Haag, Maeve Cummings, Donald McCubbrey, Alain Pinsonneault and Richard Donovan Third Canadian Edition Management Information Systems for the Information Age Mcgraw-Hill Ryerson, Canada, 2006 Workplace Telecommuting ","title":"Virtual workplace"},{"id":"5722790","text":"Ted Wright Stadium is a 13,500-seat multi-purpose stadium in Savannah, Georgia.

Commonly known as the Virginia City Highway, or Geiger Grade north of Virginia City, the route has origins dating back to the 1860s. Route description View from the north end of SR 341 looking southbound State Route 341 begins at a point along US 50 in Lyon County between Mound House and Dayton, about to the west of the latter. From this intersection, the highway proceeds north towards its south junction with SR 342 in Silver City. From here, SR 341 veers eastward around Silver City and Gold Hill, proceeds up the Occidental Grade and bridges over the Virginia and Truckee Railroad at the site of that line's daylighted Tunnel #5 before reconnecting with SR 342 on the south side of Virginia City. The highway runs along C Street as it travels northward through Virginia City. SR 341 leaves Virginia City and travels northerly and westerly through winding sections on both sides of Geiger Summit. The highway then terminates just north of Steamboat Springs at Tahoe Junction, a major signalized intersection with South Virginia Street/Carson-Reno Highway (US 395 Alt.) and Mount Rose Highway (SR 431). The Nevada Department of Transportation refers to the entire route (except the portion between the SR 342 junctions, which is known locally as the Occidental Grade) as the Comstock Highway. The highway is also known as Geiger Grade between Virginia City and Tahoe Junction, though parts of its modern-day alignment deviates from the original alignment of the old stagecoach route. History Panoramic view towards Reno, from a lookout point along the Geiger Grade portion of SR 341 SR 341 began as a toll facility constructed by Davison M. Geiger and John H. Tilton in 1862. Despite the dangers associated with traveling the route, Geiger Grade was a well-traveled route that provided the most direct connection between the Comstock Lode and the Reno area. The road appears on highway maps dating back to at least 1919. However, it wasn't until 1929 that the route first appeared as State Route 17 on official Nevada highway maps. The original road was replaced with the present-day paved highway alignment in 1936. The highway appears to have remained largely unchanged until the 1970s. In the Nevada state highway renumbering that began in 1976, the entirety of State Route 17 was reassigned to present-day SR 341; this change first appears on the 1978-79 version of the official state map.

It is a subsidiary of a Chinese company Chervon. The company now focuses more on the do-it-yourself consumer, but at one time made professional construction-grade power tools, which are now being sold under their subsidiary, SKILSAW. SKIL can trace its heritage to the invention of the circular saw by Edmond Michele in 1924, which led to the development of the SKILSAW circular saw Model 77 in 1937. Now referred to as “the saw that built America,” the Model 77 set the industry standard for handheld worm-drive circular saws which remains in production almost unchanged today. In an example of a genericized trademark, portable circular saws are often still called Skilsaws or Skil saws. Skil products include circular saws, cordless drill/drivers, cordless screw drivers, cordless tackers, cordless sealant guns, belt sanders, random orbit sanders, multi-sanders, angle grinders, hammers, drills, mixers, jig saws, lasers and measuring tools, reciprocating saws, routers, and planers. History Old Skil logo In the early 1920s, Edmond Michel, a French immigrant in New Orleans with a penchant for tinkering and inventing, watched a group of farmers hack away at sugar cane with large machetes. After observing the painstaking labor the workers went through, Michel began experimenting with how to mechanize the Machete. In 1923, Michel created a motorized machete, which had a saw-blade mounted on carved wooden frame and powered with a motor taken from malted milk mixer – the first electric handsaw. After reading about Michel’s new invention, Joseph Sullivan, a Minneapolis land developer, set out to find the New Orleans inventor. After deciding to go into business together, Michel and Sullivan moved to Chicago and opened the Michel Electric Handsaw Co. in 1924. After forming the company, six production models were made at $1000 each. Michel went to the new Atlantic City's Million Dollar Boardwalk to demonstrate the new tools, where the first portable electric saw was purchased for $160 by the Piers’ developer.Herbst, Chris. “Birth of a Saw.” Popular Science. August 1961, pg. 6. Accessed through Google Books on 2013-01-22 In 1926, the Skil brand name was born after Michel left the company to pursue other ventures, and Sullivan changed the company name to Skilsaw, Inc. =Skilsaw Model 77 Invented= After surviving the Great Depression, Skil continued making improvements to its saw. During the 1930s, Skil released the Model E Skilsaw, the first generation saw with a worm drive. In 1937, Edward Sterba perfected the Model E and built the first Model 77 with a blade, considered the \\"workhorse on building sites\\". Skil celebrated the 75th anniversary of the Model 77 in 2012. =World War II= During World War II, Skil developed the PS-12 circular saw for military applications by mounting an air-driven Thor motor on a worm-driven saw for use in several types of construction. Manufactured in camouflage colors, with saw blade painted black and the body a greenish color, the saw worked just about everywhere, including underwater to cut piles or timbers. The Navy had Skil put this tool into a special camouflage box coated and sealed with plastic. When they were unable to get into a landing area, the unit would be dumped overboard and floated or dragged in for use on aircraft landing areas. =Post World War II= After the end of World War II, Skil began expanding into international markets by opening a distribution and service center in Toronto, CA, in 1946. After selling directly to customers for 25 years, since the company’s inception, Skil entered the wholesale business and began distributing its products through hardware distributors. In the 1950s, the company changed its name to the Skil Corporation. Skilsaw remained the brand name used for the company's products. European sales followed a few years later, by which time Skil had entered the consumer market. By 1959 it had a full and successful range of DIY tools. Skil's European factory was built in 1961 in the Dutch town of Breda, followed soon after by an electric motor plant at Eindhoven, Netherlands. After successfully entering the European market, by the end of 1961 Skil had opened additional offices in Switzerland, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Denmark and Germany. =Skil in Australia - 1960s= Skil Broke into the Australian market in the early 1960s, when they acquired the Australian company Sher Powertools, which was a good quality tool, and sold at a premium price intended to compete with the European brands of Wolf and Desoutter which were well established fine quality brands of tools at the time. =Skil 1970s onwards,= In the 1970s onwards, Skil constructed a network of factories, service centers and sales offices all around the world, its name becoming synonymous with power tools. Skil still has its European head office in Breda. All manufacturing of power tools for the European market is outsourced, mainly in China. Pre-development, Logisitics, Sales, Marketing and Finance are among the activities of the Dutch head office. =1979 to present= Emerson Electric acquired Skil Corporation on March 23, 1979. Under new ownership, Skil continued growth. In late 1979, Skil redesigned many of its tools to have heavy-duty plastic, double-insulated housings. In 1982, the company embarked on a program to become the most successful power tool company in America by investing heavily in new manufacturing and quality-control systems. In 1985, Skil's heavy duty and super duty tool lines were renamed \\"Skil/ Skilsaw Professional\\". By 1988, the company had achieved its goal.“Skil, the power tool company.” Chilton’s Hardware Age.

It was the first of only two tracks by the group not to contain lyrics; the other was the title track of their 1976 release, Arrival. It is the only purely instrumental ABBA song however, as Arrival includes \\"a static layer of rich harmony vocals\\". On the cover, the song was credited as \\"Intermezzo No.1 featuring Benny Andersson\\".

Another working title for the song was Bach-låten (The Bach Tune).http://www.carlmagnuspalm.com/Upload/abbabooks/completeguidechapter.pdf In September 1975, it was released as the B-side to ABBA's single, \\"Mamma Mia\\".Recording information on \\"Intermezzo No. 1\\" Carl Magnus Palm describes it as a \\"showcase of Benny's classical music influences\\", which first began to appear in his work with The Hep Stars songs Sunny Girl and Wedding. Carl Magnus Palm explains the song was a \\"popular feature on every subsequent ABBA tour\\" after the ABBA album was released. For example, the song is shown being performed in the 1977 concert tours in the film ABBA: The Movie. Composition The song has a \\"piano and guitar-led instrumental\\". Many of ABBA's pieces are full of \\"thematic throwaways of the rich folk music culture [of Sweden]\\". This song is a \\"solo vehicle\\" in which to indulge in classical music. The grand piano is the central instrument, layered by a \\"flamboyant network of synth textures and brass punches\\". ABBA: Let The Music Speak explains \\"the main theme is inviting and uncomplicated, constantly giving way to a rapid-fire succession of mood-swinging secondary themes\\".

Bright Lights Dark Shadows: The Real Story of Abba explains that while \\"experiments in applying classical music to a pop format were very much in vogue at the time [Intermezzo No.1] ha[s] come to seem a little dated\\".

It is originally a 1992 play with the same name. Synopsis The movie takes place in modern times when Butterfly returns from retirement in Canada to perform in a final charity show at the Flower Palace Nightclub before it is demolished. The film takes place in a continuing flashback of one fateful night in 1967 at the Flower Palace Nightclub. The film follows the lives of a 1960s girl group called \\"The 4 Nuts\\". On the night of the Hong Kong 1967 Leftist Riots, Butterfly Yiu was given an accidental chance to perform the final show when the original and star performer, Pak Long, was stranded at another venue. This started a chain of events that will change the four character's lives forever. =Ending Of Four Main Characters= Out of the four main characters, only Butterfly became very famous, and had a long career as a singer and actress. She had financial security, but lost out on romance, as her love interest, Karl Sum, cannot bear the pressure and relative shame of living with someone who is much more popular. Karl left for New York City to start a new career, only to be reunited with Butterfly at the end of the movie. This ending differs from the adapted ATV series, as although Butterfly and Karl meet again, she cannot forgive him for leaving her. Lulu Kim also became popular as a singer and actress, but not on the same level as Butterfly. Lulu eventually was married to Luk Tat Sun, the son of one of the directors of the Flower Palace Nightclub. He originally sought to marry Butterfly, but she waited out for Karl, and refused his advances. Fung Ping continues her unlucky streak in romance. She followed Donny, her gambling-addict boyfriend, to Vietnam with a show tour team. She arrived in Vietnam at the height of the Vietnam War, and was presumably killed during a bombing raid by US Forces. She gave birth to a son while in Vietnam, despite earlier promises of an abortion, and Karl Sum adopted the son and took him to the US. He was united with Butterfly at the end of the movie. Nancy eventually sought another job at another nightclub as a lounge singer. She remained obscure, and became depressed and an alcoholic. She eventually lost her voice due to alcohol and died of cirrhosis. Butterfly only knew of this right before her charity show. Characters *Butterfly Yiu (姚小蝶)- One of the \\"Four Crazy Kings\\" (四大顛皇) at the Flower Palace Nightclub (麗花皇宮夜總會). She was initially among the lesser known singers of the nightclub, but through a series of events, she started her road to stardom. *Lulu Kim (金露露)- The second one of the \\"Four Crazy Kings\\" at the nightclub. She is the most unassuming of the four \\"kings\\", and eventually had a movie career and married the son of one of the Flower Palace Nightclub's directors. *Nancy Hong (紅蓮茜)- The most flamboyant of the Four Crazy Kings. Nancy is known for her fiery tempers, which gets her into very heated (almost physical) arguments with her rivals. *Fung Ping Lam (藍鳳萍)- The tragic one in the \\"Four Crazy Kings\\". She is unlucky in love, and falls in love with a gamble-addict brass band member. *Pak Long (白浪)- The most famous singer at the nightclub at the time. He is known for a rather diva-ish demeanors. It is hinted that Pak Long is homosexual, but that is not revealed in the movie. Pak Long eventually declined in popularity. *Yuen Pik (婉碧)- She is the diva of the nightclub, and was the most popular female singer at the time. She is also known for her fake bottom and breast implants, which was a part of a running gag. She was eventually outshone by Butterfly. *Karl Sum (沈家豪)- The main band member in the Flower Palace brass band. He is the love interest of Butterfly. Their relationship is rocky, and Karl eventually cannot bear the pains of living under the much more popular Butterfly. Cast This is a partial list of cast for the 1994 film. * Fung Bo-Bo as Concert Mistress of Ceremonies * Alice Lau Ar-Lai as Butterfly Yiu * Erica Choi as Lulu Kim * Joey Meng as Fung Ping Lam * Anita Lee as Bar Girl * Teresa Mo as Woman at Concert Hall * Kiki Sheung as Nancy * Tse Kwan-Ho * Raymond Wong as Maitre d' * James Wong as Triad * David Wu as Karl Sum * Yip Wing-Cho as Po Below is a partial list of cast for the 1995 ATV tv series. * Sheren Tang as Butterfly Yiu * Kwong Wa as Pianist Awards 14th Annual Hong Kong Film Awards * Law Koon-Lan - Winner of Best Supporting Actress * Alice Lau Ar-Lai - Nominated and Winner of Best New Artist * Raymond To Kwok-Wai - Winner of Best Screenplay * Fung Wai-Hung - Nominated for Best Supporting Actress * Hui Fan - Nominated for Best New Artist * Lee Hong-Gum, Wan Hol-Geen - Nominated for Best Original Score * Film was Nomination for Best Picture Related products = Theme song = The main theme song is 'I Have a Date with Spring' sung by Alice Lau. The drama was performed first by Hong Kong Repertory Theatre (香港話劇團) in 1992. The drama was later performed by the theatre (春天話劇團) of Spring-Time Stage Productions (春天舞台劇製作有限公司). = Television series = In 1995, \\"I Have a Date With Spring\\" was adapted into a television series by ATV, starring Sheren Tang as Butterfly Yiu and lasting a total of 40 episodes. Similar to the film, the series takes place in flashbacks by Butterfly as she walks through a newly restored Flower Palace Nightclub. The series explores not only the lives of Butterfly, Lulu, Nancy, and Fung Ping while working at the nightclub, but also their lives before they began working at Flower Palace (such as Nancy being raised in an orphanage), as well as ongoing issues with their families (such as Fung Ping's less fortunate background, and Butterfly's father's dying career as a Cantonese Opera singer). It also expands more on the different characters working at Flower Palace, such as Yuen Bik. = Musical = In 2001-2005, the film was rewritten as a musical, the Flower Palace (麗花皇宮), many elder famous singers played in it, sang some of their best songs. VCD and DVD of the karaoke versions of the plays are released in 2001-2003. Alice Lau and So Yuk- Wah performed in many of different performances related to the play. There is a book of the play by Raymond To (我和春天有個約會 ).

The stadium is home to the Indiana Hoosiers men's and women's soccer teams. It also hosted the NCAA Men's Soccer Championship in 1988, and is home to the annual Little 500 cycling race, which was featured in the 1979 Oscar-winning movie Breaking Away. History Construction on the stadium finished in 1981, with the 30th Running of the Little 500 being held on April 25 and the inaugural soccer game on September 13 of the same year. A $2.5 million renovation took place in 2001, bringing a new grass surface, scoreboard and grandstand. The 5,000-seat main stand includes a press facility with room for 50 members of the media. A later phase of the renovation included a 1,500-seat secondary stand on the north side of the field, bringing the stadium to its current capacity of 6,500. On December 7, 2018, Indiana University Board of Trustees approved the proposed design to renovate portions of Armstrong stadium. The approved proposal will see the existing north grandstand demolished and replaced with a new bi-level structure. The structure will provide new locker rooms for both the men's and women's teams, a lobby, a team room, a warmup area, coaches' offices and bicycle support space. During construction, temporary seating will be constructed on the west end of the stadium; however, final seating capacity has not yet been announced. Features =South Grandstand Facility= Opened in 1981, the 5,000-seat, poured-in-place grandstand includes the nation's most complete soccer press facility, including seating for 50 members of the media, restrooms and a food service area. Directly behind the press box is a customer services building with concessions and restrooms =North Grandstand Facility= The existing grandstand facility, which opened in 1983 was demolished is being replaced by a two-story structure. The facility will have locker rooms, a lobby, a team room, a warm up room, coaches offices, bicycle support space, conference rooms and public restrooms. =Jerry Yeagley Field= A new drainage system was installed three inches below the field's surface. Then there is a two-inch sandcap with a one-percent graded slope. The field is sprigged with Tahoma 31 Bermudagrass. The field was renamed in honor of six-time national champion coach Jerry Yeagley following his retirement in 2004. Therefore, the official name of the complex is Jerry Yeagley Field at Bill Armstrong Stadium, although it is still widely known as simply Armstrong Stadium. Naming This stadium is named for William S. Armstrong, Sr. who was the president of the Indiana University Foundation for many years. He was both an avid supporter of the athletic program at Indiana University and very involved with the Little 500 and its activities each year. He can be seen in the movie Breaking Away as the official starter of the race, saying, \\"Gentlemen, mount your Roadmaster bicycles.\\" References External links * Indiana University - Facilities Soccer venues in Indiana Indiana Hoosiers soccer Sports venues completed in 1981 1981 establishments in Indiana Velodromes in the United States ","title":"Bill Armstrong Stadium"},{"id":"5722934","text":"E-file may refer to: * Canadian efile, an electronic tax filing system of Canada Revenue Agency for professional tax preparers * E-file, or electronic court filing, a system for automated transmission of legal documents * e-file.lu, a website for communication between financial institutions and regulators in Luxembourg * E-FILE, a trademark filed by Sony Corporation in 1986 * IRS e-file, an electronic tax filing system of the United States Internal Revenue Service  See also  * Electronic tax filing (disambiguation) ","title":"E-file"},{"id":"5722952","text":"Aloha is an American indie rock band currently signed to Polyvinyl Records. It features Cale Parks, Matthew Gengler, Tony Cavallario and T.J. Lipple. History Aloha began with Tony and Matthew in the summer of 1997 in Bowling Green, Ohio. One of the few bands to ever actually get a record deal based on a demo tape, the band spent time based out of Cleveland. In recent years, Aloha has operated from a number of bases, doing their writing, rehearsing and living in Chicago, Washington D.C., Cleveland, Cincinnati, Rochester, Pittsburgh and Altoona. They have shared the stage with the likes of Q and Not U, Ted Leo, Clinic, as well as Cex and Joan of Arc, two bands in which Cale Parks has been a member. In 2002, New Music said of their album Sugar, \\"In the wake of That's Your Fire, Aloha's breathtaking and complex collection of jazz- based, vibraphone-enhanced lullabies, the band's sophomore release hits like a hurricane.\\" Tony and T.J. began playing together during a lull in Aloha's schedule in late 2002, when they both lived in Pittsburgh. T.J. joined the band in May 2003, when Cale, Tony and Matthew joined him at his grandpa's empty house in Altoona, Pennsylvania. There they began writing 2004's Here Comes Everyone, though at the time they didn't know it. With T.J. came a more focused approach to making music and a host of new tools including marimba, homemade mellotrons, organs and tape manipulations. T.J.'s skilled drumming also allowed Cale to move to the piano on occasion. In 2010, Spin magazine said, \\"They're emboldened by singer Cale Parks' ability to sing like Lou Barlow as a poofy-sleeved eco wizard.\\" Notably, Cale Parks is Aloha's drummer, not singer.

It was published in hardcover in 2003 by Crown Business () and released in softcover by Princeton University Press in 2004 (). The book is neither a defense of pure laissez-faire capitalism, nor is it an anti-capitalist polemic. Instead, the authors develop the following arguments in the book: *The free market is the form of economic organization most beneficial to human society and for improving the human condition. *Free markets can flourish over the long run only when government plays a visible role in determining the rules that govern the market and supporting it with the proper infrastructure. *Government, however, is subject to influence by organized private interests *Incumbent private interests, therefore, may be able to leverage the power of governmental regulation to protect their own economic position at the expense of the public interest by repressing the same free market through which they originally achieved success. *Thus, society must act to \\"save capitalism from the capitalists\\"—i.e. take appropriate steps to protect the free market from powerful private interests who would seek to impede the efficient function of free markets, entrench themselves, and thereby reduce the overall level of economic opportunity in society. The authors offer the following recommendations: *Reduce incumbent capitalists' incentives to oppose markets, especially by limiting the concentration of ownership of productive assets. *Provide a social safety net for the economically distressed to help maintain broad political support for free markets. *Keep the borders of the economy open to support free trade and maintain a high level of competitive pressure on incumbent firms. *Educate the public regarding the benefits of free markets to build political support for free market policies, or more specifically, oppose governmental interventions in the market designed to protect incumbents at the expense of overall economic opportunity.

It is a loop route of State Route 341, running north through the communities of Silver City and Gold Hill before returning to State Route 341 near Virginia City. This highway is a historic route, dating back to the Comstock Lode of the 1860s. The highway loosely parallels, and crosses, the route of the Virginia and Truckee Railroad. Prior to renumbering in the 1970s this route was known as State Route 80. Route description View from the south end of SR 342 looking northbound Hairpin curve and steep grades between Gold Hill and Virginia City SR 342 is the original and shorter of the two routes between Silver City and Virginia City. However, trucks are required to use newer alignment (SR 341) due to 15% grades and hairpin curves. The route begins just south of Gold Hill, at the junction with SR 341. Both routes have Virginia City listed as the first control city, however all trucks are directed to use SR 341 instead of SR 342. The highway runs through narrow Gold Canyon for its entire length. This highway serves as the main street of Gold Hill and Silver City. While in Silver City the highway crosses the Virginia and Truckee Railroad, now a heritage railroad that once served as a primary route to transport silver from the mines in Virginia City. History This highway was the principal highway between Virginia City and Carson City and has been in use since the Comstock Lode of the 1860s. The highway has appeared on Nevada highway maps since at least as far back as 1919 and was first numbered part of Nevada State Route 17 (modern State Route 341) sometime in the 1920s. The 1937 edition of the official Nevada Highway Map was the first to show both routes between Virginia City and Silver City, with both routes numbered 17.

It was released on June 15, 1999. Lyrics and background In a 2008 interview with British rock magazine Kerrang, guitarist Wes Borland said the following about how the lyrical content turned out: \\"The music was cool, but I didn't like the lyrics at all. The funny thing is that Nookie was actually the working title. When we were in the studio there was a porn magazine that had the word 'nookie' on the cover, so I was like, 'This song's called Nookie!', I never thought someone would actually run with it. I suppose it's all my fault.\\"http://www.blacklightburns.com/community/archive/index.php/t-463.html Fred Durst said about the song, \\"It's about my ex-girlfriend, how she treated me like shit, and I couldn't leave her, wouldn't get over it,\\" he said. \\"She screwed my friends and used me for my money. I tried to figure out why I did it, and I figured I did it all for the nookie.\\" Music video In the music video, Durst sings the song while walking through city streets drawing a crowd of followers as he leads them to a secret concert performance of the song in an alley. The band allowed hundreds of fans to participate, playing the song in front of the large crowd. All the guys went to one side of the stage, and the girls on the other side. When Durst sang the chorus at certain parts, he would hold out his microphone to the crowd, getting that particular side to sing. This was, according to Durst, to show that \\"guys go off hard, but girls go off even harder\\". At the end of the video, Durst gets arrested and taken away by the police for disturbing the peace. The video was the first in a concept video dealing with the premise that Limp Bizkit were wanted and arrested for inciting the riots that plagued Woodstock '99.

The song gained Bizkit its first Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance, but lost to Metallica's \\"Whiskey In The Jar\\". Reception Pharrell Williams, while recording N.E.R.D.'s 2008 album Seeing Sounds cited this song as part of the band's incentive and drive to record more energetic music, noting it as the last energetic hit single before the album's release.

He then attended the University of Virginia from 2000 to 2003, where he became one of the most decorated midfielders in Cavaliers history. As a senior in 2003, Rotelli helped lead the team to the 2003 NCAA Division I National Championship.

Kristinas Astikas, a noble from Kernavė, was the founder of the family. There is some vague evidence, that his father was Sirputis (probably descendant of other Sirputis, brother of Traidenis, Bardis, Liesis, and Svalkenis) and his grandfather was Viršulis, mentioned in chronicles. It is worth to note, that members of Astikai family on different occasions were referred to by these names. One of treaties signed by Kristinas Astikas mentions his father name, Radvilas. However, that is the only reliable clue into the genealogy of Astikai family. Astikas name is first mentioned in 1398 in the Treaty of Salynas as castellan of Užpaliai. After Union of Horodło he received Trąby coat of arms. From 1419 until his death in 1442 or 1444, he was castellan of Vilnius. He was a strong supporter of Vytautas the Great and participated in signing of many treaties, including Peace of Thorn in 1411, Treaty of Melno in 1422, and Union of Grodno in 1432. It is known that Kristinas Astikas had four sons: Radvilas, Stanislovas (sometimes also called Stankus), Mikalojus and Baltramiejus. Radvila Astikas (died in 1477) was voivode of Trakai and became an ancestor of a new family, known as Radvilos. Later the name was polonized to Radziwiłł. Since there is nothing known about Mikalojus and Baltramiejus, historians assume they died in their youth. Stanislovas became a voivode of Navahrudak and continued the Astikai family line. His son Gregory became Court Marshal in 1494. As a vicegerent of Anykščiai and Merkinė, he participated in the Battle of Vedrosha in 1500 and was taken prisoner. After he returned, he received his old title of Court Marshal, but previously owned lands were not returned to him. Instead he received Užpaliai and other territories ruled by his brother Radvilas and his sons. From 1510 to his death in 1518 or 1519 Gregory was also a voivode of Trakai. After Gregory's death, the family started losing its influence and prestige. Gregory had three sons, Gregory, voivode of Navahrudak and castellan of Vilnius who died in 1557, Stanislaw, voivode of Polatsk who died in 1519, and Jurgis, Court Marshal who died in 1546. Only Jurgis had children: sons Mikalojus, Jonas, Gregory, and Jurgis and daughters Joan and Sophie. Mikalojus was starosta of Kreva and Rēzekne. He popularized the theory that Astikai family roots from Sirputis and changed his name to Astikas Sirputis. Another son Jurgis (1530–1579) was starosta of Mstislavl and Bratslav, and voivode of Smolensk. In 1580 Jurgis' brother Gregory received death sentence because he falsified signatures and money. He was also accused of conspiracy with Moscow to assassinate Stefan Batory, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. Gregory's only son, Jonas, was acquitted. Jonas, a petty officer in Vilnius, was the last recorded member of the Astikai family (died 1609).

Nisei means 2nd generation in Japanese, describing the first American born Japanese, a group which the seven-day festival was originally meant to attract. Though named for the Nisei generation, Nisei Week is no longer targeted at Niseis, nor is the festival still contained within a week. Nisei Week Foundation president for 2006, Michelle Suzuki, described the festival as \\"the opportunity for people of all backgrounds to celebrate Japanese heritage and culture\\".Muranaka, Gwen, Nisei Week Kicks Off Annual Festivities, Rafu Shimpo, June 10, 2006. URL accessed on August 3, 2006. Festivities are held over one month, though the main attractions are held during the primary two weekends of the festival in mid-August. Nisei Week draws tens of thousands of participants each year from both the Japanese community and Southern California area, mostly to its Grand Parade and specialized festivals. The 80th Annual Nisei Week Festival & the Grand Parade were to take place in August 2020. The 12th Annual Tanabata Festival was to be held in Little Tokyo in mid-August 2020, but all of which were cancelled & deferred to 2021. History and cultural analysis Nisei Week's history began during the financially difficult era of the Great Depression -- Issei, first generation Japanese immigrants, were growing too old and the Gentlemen's Agreement prohibited new Japanese immigration. The English speaking Nisei became a sought after potential revenue source to support Little Tokyo businesses dominated by Issei. With Little Tokyo falling into stagnation, Nisei week was a celebration intended to attract Niseis and to help generate more youthful exuberance in the district.Tanaka, Togo, The History of Nisei Week, 50th Anniversary Booklet, Nisei Week Foundation, 1990. URL accessed on August 3, 2006. Mihiko Shimizu, original inventor of the festival, and other Issei business owners vied for an alliance with the Nisei run Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) to promote the festival. However, the possibility of being labelled as anti- American by anti-Japanese groups remained a concern, due to the collaboration of the two generations (American citizens and Japanese nationals) and cultural overtones of the festival. The Issei business owners decided to hand over all aspects of the celebration to the independent JACL to settle the problem. The first festival was held August 13, 1934, founded by the JACL.Kurashige, Lon, The Problem of Biculturalism: Japanese American Identity and Festival before World War II,The Journal of American History, March 2000. URL accessed August 4, 2006. Beyond economic reasons, Nisei Week was created to promote \\"ethnic solidarity\\". Utilizing Nisei Week's cultural environment, by centering it in the heart of Little Tokyo and holding cultural events, Issei hoped to bring Nisei back into the cultural fold of the older generation. Issei also hoped for Nisei to become brokers between Little Tokyo and the dominant society around it. The creation of the Nisei Week Queen, one year after the first Nisei Week in 1935, may be seen as the epitome of cultural mediation and broker between the Japanese community and white America. Mike Haigwara, Nisei Week's 2007 Street Arts and Carnival director, attributes Nisei Week with helping foster Japanese American identity and self-esteem. Japanese internment presented another tumultuous and racially charged period for Nisei Week and the greater Japanese community. Executive Order 9066 was initiated in 1942, relocating and confining Japanese Americans to internment camps, including those running Nisei Week. The festival has been running continuously, except the years during and immediately after internment. Nisei Week celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1990, shifted from 6 years of inactivity during the WWII era. Despite obstacles, Nisei Week is the longest running Japanese festival in California, celebrating its 80th birthday in 2020.Nisei Week Japanese Festival: A Brief History, sushiandtofu.com, All Japan News, August 2002. URL accessed on August 3, 2006. Retrospectively, the celebration was seen by Time Magazine as dual reminder: \\"Unofficially, it recalls an ugly footnote to American history: the World War II evacuation and internment of more than 110,000 West Coast Japanese, most of them native-born U.S. citizens.\\"Time Magazine, , http://www.time.com, Time Inc., August 11, 1961. Lon Kurashige, professor of ethnic studies at USC, proposes that the lingering effects of internment changed Nisei Week's cultural tones and affiliations, in part due to the weakening role of men during the internment period, which again shifted during and after the civil rights period. Phillip Morris' first promotional event targeted at Asian and Pacific Islander American community events was staged at Nisei Week. The event was part of a larger \\"PULL strategy\\" program, which included marketing to increase brand recognition among Asians. A Marlboro booth provided samples and attempted to attract consumers by displaying a McLaren MP4/4 show car (Marlboro sponsored McLaren's F1 team at the time) at the 1988 Nisei Week festival.Muggli, M.E.; Pollay, R.W.; Lew, R.; Joseph, A.M. , Targeting of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders by the tobacco industry: results from the Minnesota Tobacco Document Depository (pdf), Tobacco Control, 2002. In 1982, businesswoman Frances Hashimoto became the first woman to chair the Nisei Week festival. \\"Aki the Akita\\", Nisei Week's official mascot, was created by renowned mascot artist Dick Sakahara in 1997 for Nisei Week's now defunct Dog Show . Aki appears as a costumed character to greet and entertain children, or in cartoon form as a symbol for the festival.Aki the Akita,Niseiweek.org, Nisei Week Foundation, 2005.

The parade features many varied participants, mostly from Southern California and Japan, including the following: local high school marching bands, ondo dancing groups, martial art dojos, elected parade marshals (usually celebrities or community heroes), Japanese and local politicians (such as the Mayor of Los Angeles), a mikoshi shrine, floats, pageant queens, taiko players, etc. Spanning several hours, the Nisei Week Parade lasts long due to its many participants and slow walk pace of traditional Japanese dancers.Nisei WEEK Festival Parade and Participants 1996, Nisei Week Festival Parade flyer, Nisei Week Foundation, 1996.

Originally the queen was selected through ballots given after purchases in Little Tokyo, allowing those making many purchases to vote many times; the rule was changed to allow a fairer chance for all contestants. One controversy remains within the JA community: mixed-race contestants. Competitors must be of at least 50% Japanese ancestry. Due to the increased outmarriage ratio of Japanese Americans, multi-racial (also known as hapa in the Japanese community) contestants began to appear more frequently, causing questioning about the Japanese cultural spirit of the competition and competing beauty standards of whites versus Asians.Tanner, Mika,Pageants: Pride or Puffery?, Asian Week, August 20, 1998. URL accessed August 4, 2006. Lon Kurashige, professor of ethnic studies at USC, argues that Nisei Queens played a subordinate role to as ambassadors to Issei, Nisei and white Americans. The Queens were viewed as bi-cultural, possessing \\"quiet charm\\" and \\"lively personality\\", attributed to Japanese and white Americans respectively. Criticism of sexism was brought forth by the Women's Concerns Committee within the JACL. The typical beauty portion of pageants, such as swimsuit competition, were eliminated from the Queen coronation.Yeh, Chiou-ling,Celebrating Freedom and Ethnicity, American Quarterly 57.1, URL accessed January 30, 2007. – =Nisei Week Street Arts Fair and Carnival= The Street Arts Fair during 2007.Originally similar to a matsuri (Japanese style festival) or carnival, a street festival was held over the weekend, featuring games, crafts, and rides for children, along with food and arts vendors. Street Arts was created in addition to the carnival to feature Southern California crafts and food vendors. The old style carnival was largely removed by 2000's festival year. Street Arts and the carnival were always open to the public, with no admission fee. The 2006 fair included an eating contest of dumplings (gyoza). World champion eaters Sonya Thomas and Joey Chestnut competed in the International Federation of Competitive Eating sanctioned event, with both competitors eating over 200 dumplings. Old School Carnival Return Mike Hagiwara, a Nisei Week committee member, announced the return of the \\"old school\\" Nisei Week carnival for 2007's festivities, under his direction. His press release, circulating by email and JA news, describes the nostalgia and eventual dwindling of the carnival. The carnival goals include creating long lasting and enjoyable memories to a new generation, along with helping the older generation relive memories of Nisei Week's past. The carnival also plans to avoid commercialization, using community groups to populate the vending and game booths. Hagiwara believes the carnival will help foster Japanese American identity, giving JAs a medium to feel better about themselves and their heritage. =JSN Matsuri= Partnering with the Japanese Student Network (JSN), Nisei Week's 66th annual celebration included a Japanese style carnival thrown by JSN.Imoto, Yuzo,Japanese Student Network Matsuri, Niseiweek.org, Nisei Week Foundation, 2006.

The event attracts top stars on the competitive eating circuit, with Joey Chestnut and Matt Stonie winning the past few years. Other notable stars who have competed include Miki Sudo, Eric \\"Badlands\\" Booker, and Geoffrey Esper. =Ondo dancing and closing= In tradition of Japanese matsuris, traditional ondo dances are conducted in a closing celebration of Nisei Week's events. Madame Fujima Kansuma was 2006's official choreographer, where her and fellow instructors held chochin lanterns marked with the names of deceased instructors of the past. Public participation is encouraged, with formal dance troupes, Nisei Week Queen and Court, families, and community groups joining in for the dances.Muranaka, Gwen Ondo Concludes 66th Nisei Week Festivities, Rafu Shimpo, Los Angeles News Publishing Co.

If all challenged words are acceptable, the challenger loses his turn. In tournament play, a player challenges by neutralizing the game clock and announcing, \\"Challenge.\\" Both players must refer to word judge software, or request an adjudicator if one is unable to do so. Depending on the rules in play, there may be different consequences for a challenge. There are three common variations: double challenge, single challenge, and penalty challenge.  Double challenge  Double challenge is most widely used in North American club and tournament play. Suppose a player makes a play and the opponent challenges. If the challenged word(s) are acceptable, the challenger loses his turn. If any of the challenged words is unacceptable, the player removes his played tiles and forfeits his turn. In NASPA tournament play, the only exception occurs when the first play of the game misses the center star, in which the opponent may challenge the play off the board, regardless of its validity. A criticism of double challenge is that it is more conducive to bluffing. A player may play a word he or she knows is invalid in the hope that his or her opponent will not risk a challenge.  Single challenge  In single challenge, if a player places a word and his opponent wishes to challenge, the challenger may do so with no penalty. If the word is valid, it remains on the board. If it is invalid, it is removed from the board, the challenged player gets back exactly the same letters as he had, and the turn is noted as a pass with a score of zero points. The challenger receives no penalty (point deduction or loss of a turn) no matter if the challenged play is valid or invalid. A suggested flaw of this is that a player can challenge any word at any time, even words he knows to be valid; since tournament games are usually timed, this can be used to unfairly gain additional time to think about his own next turn.  Penalty challenge  In penalty challenge (also known as modified single challenge, 5-point challenge, or 10-point challenge), a fixed number of points for the penalty is agreed on before the game, either by the two players or more often in tournament play, by the director(s). If a player challenges his opponent's play and it is invalid, the letters are taken back as usual and the opponent loses his turn. However, if the word is valid, the word remains on the board and the challenger loses 5, 10 or however many points the agreed penalty was. This can either be given to the opponent or subtracted from the challenger's score, depending on the agreed rules. This is a compromise between single and double challenge, with many of the strengths and weaknesses of the two. Players are unlikely to challenge a word they know just to gain thinking time, as it may cost points or spread. On the other hand, the potential loss of points of a failed challenge may discourage a player from challenging a word they believe to be invalid, increasing the chances of an invalid word remaining throughout the game.  Holding a play  In club and tournament play, a player may choose to \\"hold\\" the previous play, provided that the opponent has not seen a single drawn tile yet, in order to consider whether to challenge. To do this, the player simply announces, \\"Hold,\\" which prevents the opponent from drawing replenishment tiles for 15 seconds (but may draw thereafter, keeping those tiles separate). The player may decide to rescind the hold, or challenge the play.  Internet variations  Scrabble and Scrabble-like game sites on the Internet such as Yahoo! Games' Literati, Internet Scrabble Club and Lexulous offer automatic verification as an option, which makes it impossible to play an invalid word. The Facebook version of Scrabble and Zynga's mobile game Words With Friends make automatic verification compulsory without imposing a penalty for wrong guesses or a limit on the number of attempts, allowing players to guess repeatedly at words until the computer verifies one to be acceptable. On the Internet Scrabble Club, where multiple languages are available, automatic validation allows players to play in their second language or even languages they have no experience with, without the fear of an invalid word ever being played. Lexulous also has a \\"strict challenge\\" option in which a player loses a turn as well as 20 points on a wrong challenge.

Designed by prominent architect Abner Cook, it was built in 1854 and has been the home of every governor since 1856. Governor Greg Abbott and First Lady Cecilia Phalen Abbott are the current residents. On June 8, 2008, while midway through a major renovation, the mansion was badly damaged by an arson fire started with a Molotov cocktail. History The mansion is the oldest continuously inhabited house in Texas and fourth oldest governor's mansion in the United States that has been continuously occupied by a chief executive. The mansion was the first-designated Texas historic landmark, in 1962. and It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as \\"Governor's Mansion\\" in 1970, and further was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1974. Original architecture Built by Abner Cook in a Greek Revival style and completed in 1856, the building occupies the center of a block and is surrounded by trees and gardens. The original mansion was . Remodeling in 1914 increased the size of the mansion to 8,920 square feet. The original mansion had 11 rooms but no bathrooms. The remodeling brought the room count to 25 rooms and 7 bathrooms. In 1931, at the recommendation of former Texas First Lady Mildred Paxton Moody, the Forty- second Texas Legislature established the Board of Mansion Supervisors to oversee all interior and exterior upkeep and enhancements to the mansion. Mrs. Moody was the first head of the Board, which was abolished in 1965. 2008 fire The mansion was partially destroyed by a four-alarm fire during the early morning of June 8, 2008. Then-Governor Rick Perry and his wife Anita Thigpen Perry were in Europe at the time of the fire. They had relocated in October 2007 for a $10 million major deferred maintenance project that began in January 2008. The project was to include a fire suppression system. State Fire Marshal Paul Maldonado said the next Sunday that investigators had evidence that an arsonist targeted the 152-year-old building. On February 2, 2011, Chief Tony Leal, an assistant director of the Texas Rangers, announced that a person of interest has been identified that is connected to an Austin- based anarchist group which has also been linked to an attack (involving Molotov cocktails) which was planned for the Republican National Convention in St. Paul during September 2008. No one has ever been charged and there has never been any evidence linking anarchist involvement to date. An official close to the investigation said agents determined the fire was a criminal act \\"after reviewing footage from security cameras.\\" To date the crime has gone unclaimed. A restoration was begun, with a scheduled completion in 2012. In May 2009, $22 million was allocated to the restoration of the Governor's Mansion, $11 million of which came from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. An additional $3.4 million has been raised through private fund raising. The restoration area, which includes the mansion and the adjacent segment of Colorado Street, has been closed to the public with a chain-link fence and barbed wire.

The Treatise was often referred to as T and T ', as explained by Alexander Macfarlane:A. Macfarlane (1917) Lectures on Ten British Physicist of the Nineteenth Century, link form Internet Archive. :Maxwell had facetiously referred to Thomson as T and Tait as T '. Hence the Treatise on Natural Philosophy came to be commonly referred to as T and T ' in conversation with mathematicians. Reception The first volume was received by an enthusiastic review in Saturday Review: :The grand result of all concurrent research in modern times has been to confirm what was but perhaps a dream of genius, or an instinct of the keen Greek intellect, that all the operations of nature are rooted and grounded in number and figure.Saturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science, and Art, November 21, 1868, pp 687,8 The Treatise was also reviewed as Elements of Natural Philosophy (1873). Thomson & Tait's Treatise on Natural Philosophy was reviewed by J. C. Maxwell in Nature of 3 July 1879 indicating the importance given to kinematics: \\"The guiding idea … is that geometry itself is part of the science of motion.\\" In 1892 Karl Pearson noted that T and T ' perpetuated a \\"subjectivity of force\\" that originated with Newton. In 1902 Alexander Macfarlane ascribed much of the inspiration of the book to William Rankine's 1865 paper \\"Outlines of the Science of Energetics\\": :The main object of Thomson and Tait's Treatise on Natural Philosophy was to fill up Rankine's outlines, — expound all branches of physics from the standpoint of the doctrine of energy. The plan contemplated four volumes; the printing of the first volume began in 1862 and was completed in 1867. The other three volumes never appeared. When a second edition was called for, the matter of the first volume was increased by a number of appendices and appeared as two separately bound parts. The volume which did appear, although judged rather difficult reading even by accomplished mathematicians, has achieved great success. It has been translated in French and German; it has educated the new generation of mathematical physicists; and it has been styled the \\"Principia\\" of the nineteenth century. In 1851 Arthur Schopenhauer derided T and T as a \\"splendid example of\\": :Thoughts put into forced and involved language, creat[ing] new words and prolix periods which go round the thought and cover it up. They hesitate between the two attempts of communicating the thought and of concealing it. They want to make it look grand so that it has the appearance of being learned and profound, thereby giving one the idea that there is much more in it than one perceives at the moment. Accordingly, they sometimes put down their thoughts in bits, in short, equivocal, and paradoxical sentences which appear to mean much more than they say.

The name arises because such a theorem ensures that there is endless scope to keep discovering new techniques to improve the way at least some specific task is done. For example, the full employment theorem for compiler writers states that there is no such thing as a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler, as such a proof for the compiler would have to detect non-terminating computations and reduce them to a one-instruction infinite loop. Thus, the existence of a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler would imply a solution to the halting problem, which cannot exist. This also implies that there may always be a better compiler since the proof that one has the best compiler cannot exist. Therefore, compiler writers will always be able to speculate that they have something to improve. A similar example in practical computer science is the idea of no free lunch in search and optimization, which states that no efficient general-purpose solver can exist, and hence there will always be some particular problem whose best known solution might be improved. Similarly, Gödel's incompleteness theorems have been called full employment theorems for mathematicians. Tasks such as virus writing and detection, and spam filtering and filter-breaking are also subject to Rice's theorem.

As with sunnah prayer, they are not considered obligatory but are thought to confer extra benefit on the person performing them. An example is the offering of 4 \\"nafl\\" (optional but beneficial) rakats before the compulsory dhuhr prayers. According to the following hadith, nafl not only draws one closer to Allah but also helps one attain the better success in the afterworld i.e. Jannah (Paradise):eo : \\"Rabi'ah ibn Malik al-Aslami reported that the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) said: \\"Ask [anything].\\" Rabi'ah said: \\"I ask of you to be your companion in paradise.\\" The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) said: \\"Or anything else?\\" Rabi'ah said: \\"That is it.\\" The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) said to him: \\"Then help me by making many prostrations [i.e. supererogatory prayers]\\".- Sahih Muslim Tahiyatul Wudu Tahiyatul wudu is the nafl prayer after doing wudhu. Abu Hureyrah narrates that once Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) asked Bilal at Fajr salah: Bilal replied: Abu Hureyrah narrated that Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) said to Bilal Bilal said : After completion of the wudhu of two rakats is full of blessings (sawāb). It should not be performed during the improper (makruh) times. (When the sun rises, when it is at zenith and when it sets.) Ishraq prayer The time for the Ishraq prayer begins fifteen to twenty minutes after sunrise and consists of two Raka'ahs. Praying ishraq is considered to yield greater rewards than performing the lesser Umrah according to some traditions.Targhib p. 427. vol. I ref. Abu Yate ba Isnad-e- Sahib“According to majority of scholars of Hadith and Fiqh, Duha Prayer and Al-Ishraq Prayer are all names of the same salah (ritual Prayer). It is a recommended Prayer without any fixed number of raka'ahs, and its time proper starts a little after sun rise (approximately fifteen minutes after sunrise) and extends up to the time of the declining of the sun from the meridian. Duha prayer Duha prayer begins after sunrise and ends at meridian, and is generally thought to include at least two raka'ahs, though in some traditions the number is four or even twelve.Al-Sunan al-Sughra #1,659Sahih Muslim #1,175Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal #23,317Sunan Ibn Majah #1,371Mishkaat pg.116 According to the Sunni thought, performing this prayer is believed to be effective in seeking forgiveness for one's sins.Sunan al-Tirmidhi #438 Chasht or Duha Prayer Chasht or Duha prayer begins when the sun rises a quarter in the morning, and it ends before the time of Dhuhr prayer (i.e. obligatory prayer). It has been said that the one who performs chasht nafls, has a reward of 1 castle of Gold in Jannah. i.e. 1 Chasht prayer = 1 gold castle. Fatima used to be regular in this supererogatory prayer. The supererogatory morning prayer has been narrated from Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), through paths that have reached mass-narration levels - from 19 to over 30 Companions - according to Imam al-Tabari, al-\`Ayni in \`Umdat al-Qari, al- Haytami, al-Munawi, and al-Qari in Sharh al-Shama'il, Ibn Hajar in Fath al- Bari, al-Kattani in Nazm al-Mutanathir, and as per the monographs compiled by al-Hakim and al-Suyuti as well as the recensions of Abu Zur\`a al-\`Iraqi in Tarh al-Tathrib, Ibn al-Qayyim in Zad al-Ma\`ad, and al-Shawkani in Nayl al- Awtar. According to the vast majority of the Ulema of the Salaf and Khalaf it is a desirable and recommended prayer. Four Rak'aah Sunnah of Zuhr Muhammad (Peace & Blessings Be Upon Him) is reported to have said that Whoever performs the four rakaats before and after the Zuhr salah with constancy, Allah Ta'ala makes the fire of Hell haram (forbidden) for him. [Mishkat,(Hasan-Chain) p. 104; Tirmizi, Abu Da'ud, Nisai 1814, Ibn Majah] Muhammad (Peace & Blessings Be Upon Him) is reported to have said that after the worshipper prays the four rakaats of Zuhr salah, the doors of heaven are opened, i.e. the salah becomes accepted by Allah, and the cause of its acceptance comes down on the worshipper as rays of mercy. [Mishkat, p. 104] 4 Rak'aah Sunnah of Asr Muhammad (Peace & Blessings Be Upon Him) said: \\"May Allah have Mercy on the one who offers four (rak'ahs) before 'Asr prayer.\\" (Abu Dawud) Tahiyyatul Masjid (Nafl prayer when entering Masjid) Abu Qatada narrated that Muhammad(Peace & Blessings Be Upon Him) said: “If any one of you enters a mosque, he should pray two raka’ats before sitting.”Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim(Sahih) *This is a 2 Rak'aah Nafl prayer which one should perform as one enters the Masjid and on proper times. =Names= The supererogatory morning prayer has many names. Among them: *Salat al-Duha or Sibhat al-Duha - Sibha meaning a supererogatory prayer in general and Duha meaning morning, mid- morning, or late morning. This is the name that reoccurs the most in the narrations. It is the late morning prayer when the sun is very hot.Kanz al- Ummal #23437, 23461 The reason for this name is that one leaves dunya at that time to return to Allah Most High and makes up for the Night prayer that he missed. Hence Salat al-Duha is even more stressed for those who miss tahajjud and is its replacement.Ibn al-Qayyim, Zad al-Ma\`ad (1:356)Itr, I\`lam al-Anam Sharh Bulugh al-Maram, p. 628 *Salat al-Awwabin - is the \\"prayer of the Oft- Returning\\" as specified by Prophet Muhammad (Salalahu Elhay Waalehee Wasalim) and is offered between Maghrib prayer and Isha prayer. Howerer, many scholars say the there are no sahih hadiths confirming that Salat al-Awwabin is to be prayed between Maghrib and Isha prayers and are they are of opinion that in fact it is the same prayer as Duha prayer. *Salat al-Ishraq - is the \\"sunrise prayer\\" or the prayer performed very shortly after sunrise. *Salat al-Fath - is the \\"victory prayer\\" as it was established that Prophet Muhammad (Salalahu Elhay Waalehee Wasalim) prayed it the morning he entered Makkah (in al-Bukhari and Muslim) and this has become the Sunna of military leaders upon entering a newly conquered region.

Focused on the youth lifestyle market. Currently sold in 80 countries worldwide, Nixon maintains stand-alone retail stores in Berkeley, California as well as Bondi & Melbourne, Australia and Kuta, Bali. History Nixon was founded by Andy Laats and Chad DiNenna. Both Laats and DiNenna worked in the action sports industry and were introduced through mutual people working in those circles. Laats, a former snowboard product manager at Burton with an engineering degree from Cornell University, was in the process of earning his Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Stanford University when he and DiNenna met to discuss the startup of Nixon. DiNenna, originally from Southern California, had studied Communications at California State University, Long Beach and previously worked in publishing at TransWorld Media for five years prior to the launch of Nixon. Laats and DiNenna raised nearly US$1 million from venture capitalists to start Nixon and, in 1997, the debut catalog was released; seven models were released through 200 retailers. Nixon opened a subsidiary in France in 2000, and by 2005 had 90 models and 60 employees, with sales growing by 55 percent annually. Purchase In December 2006, Nixon was acquired by Billabong International for approximately US$55 million and a deferred payment of approximately US$76 million in FY 2012. During the spring of 2012, after six years under the Billabong umbrella of brands, Nixon once again became an independent brand. Nixon established an agreement with Trilantic Capital Partners (“TCP”) and Billabong, each of which now owns a 48.5% stake in the brand, with the balance 3% held by Nixon management, including Laats and DiNenna. The resulting transaction values Nixon at approximately US$464 million, representing a multiple of approximately 9.2x LTM EBITDA.

Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was designated as its first commander. McClellan led efforts in the spring and early summer of 1861 to occupy the area of western Virginia that wanted to remain in the Union. His forces defeated two small Confederate armies and paved the way for the region to later became the state of West Virginia. After McClellan was reassigned to command the Army of the Potomac, Brig.

Under his directive, troops pushed southward towards Huntsville, Alabama, from Chattanooga, Tennessee, but were turned away. Then, General Orders No. 97 commanded Maj. Gen.

The Department of the Ohio was dissolved on March 11, 1862, when it was merged into the Department of the Mississippi and the Department of the Mountains. 2nd Department 1862–1865 The Department of the Ohio was recreated on August 19, 1862, and consisted of the states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and the part of Kentucky east of the Tennessee River. Maj. Gen. Horatio G. Wright was assigned to command the reconstituted department. In September, western Virginia was added to the department, along with all Federal troops in the region. On March 25, 1863, after the Senate refused to confirm Wright's promotion to major general, Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside assumed command of the Department of the Ohio. Wright, after briefly occupying a subordinate command in Louisville, Kentucky, transferred in May 1863 to the Army of the Potomac to command the 1st Division of VI Corps. Burnside consolidated all the forces of the department and created the XXIII Corps, which was also named the Army of the Ohio, with himself in command. Elements of the new Army of the Ohio helped repel Morgan's Raid, although the entire army rarely functioned as a single unit during this campaign. On October 16, 1863, the Department of the Ohio (along with the Department of the Tennessee and the Department of the Cumberland) became part of the Military Division of the Mississippi, under the overall command of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Due to illness, Burnside asked to be relieved of command after the Battle of Fort Sanders and was replaced by Maj. Gen. John G. Foster on December 9. On February 9, 1864, Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield assumed command of the Department of the Ohio. For much of the remainder of the war, the department was synonymous with the Army of the Ohio.

He is a professor at the National School of Political Studies and Public Administration (SNSPA) in Bucharest, and became its dean in December 2005. Born in Ploieşti, Pârvulescu graduated in 1989 from the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Philosophy, and went on to finish his education at the Paris-based Institut d'Etudes Politiques and the Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques. He authored his Ph.D. thesis on Tendencies and Evolutions in the Dynamics of the Western European Political Parties at the End of the 20th Century. Pârvulescu is an active figure in the Romanian post-1989 Revolution non-governmental organization scene. He has been president of Pro Democraţia since 1999, is a founding member of the Romanian Political Science Association, and counselor for the World Bank Comprehensive Development Frame Program. He has published a series of articles, studies and papers, and has taken part in a large number of seminars, debates, congresses, conferences, symposia and round tables. He is a frequent editorialist, commentator and analyst in Romanian and foreign media including Curentul, Dilema, BBC, Radio Free Europe, Romanian national television, Pro TV, Radio România Actualităţi and Radio România Internaţional. Pârvulescu was deputy editor of the monthly Sfera Politicii between 1994 and 1997. Political party science His early career was centered on denouncing the negative consequences of the single-party communist regime that was present in Romania between 1948 and 1989, as well as of having major former second-rank Romanian Communist Party members continue holding important governmental posts (after the Communist era, the Romanian political party system was dominated by the National Salvation Front, perceived as a neo-communist party with a small faction of democrats and reformists). Seen as a reformist and a leader in democratic thought, Pârvulescu was, in the early 1990s, more and more often invited as a guest on political talk shows. What he saw as the failure of the Romanian Democratic Convention government (a centre-right coalition that governed Romania between 1996 and 2000) made him more critical of the Romanian political party system—in his view, mainstream Romanian parties were more interested in immediate electoral success than in making the whole political system and the whole country work better. He also denounced the consequences of the party-list electoral system in use in Romania, which, according to him, makes members of Parliament more dependent on party decisions, letting them stray away from their own political beliefs in favor of \\"political party discipline\\". Pârvulescu attributed the apparent problems faced by the Parliament in adopting legislation to this phenomenon. Current activities After the 2004 elections, Pârvulescu, perceived by many as the most credible social and political commentator, indicated that the conflict of the two major parties in the Justice and Truth Alliance has no good effect on the EU accession of 2007. Each Sunday, he hosts on a TVR 1 political talk show, Săptămâna Politică (\\"This Week in Politics\\") and, on Saturdays, a Realitatea TV show, Numele meu (My Name Is), which analyzes the most recent and notorious trends and persons in politics.

Sunnah prayer have different characteristics: some are done at the same time as the five daily compulsory prayers, some are done only at certain times (e.g. late at night), or only for specific occasions (e.g. during a drought); some have their own name (e.g. Tahajjud) and some are identified by how they are performed (e.g. \\"4 (rakat) before Zuhr and 2 after\\"). The length of Sunnah prayer also varies. While the five daily salah are wajib/fard (obligatory), Sunnah prayer (and other sunnah deeds) are Mustahabb (encouraged) -- those who perform them will earn a reward in the afterlife, but there will be no punishment for neglecting them. Sunnah (in mainstream Islam), means the traditional customs and practices that (are believed to) follow the example of the Prophet of Islam Muhammad. According to the stories, narrations, interpretations, of Muslim tradition, all of these prayers were originally performed by Muhammad (in addition to the five daily obligatory prayers). Differences ;Compared to regular compulsory prayer Sohaib Sultan states that the steps for Sunnah prayer (Takbir, al-Fatihah, etc.) are exactly the same as for five daily obligatory (fard) prayers, but varying depending on the prayer are the number of rakat (also rakʿah ( ', ; plural: '), which is a unit of prayer. ;Prayers done only at certain times Tahajjud and Tarawih are night prayers, Tarawih is only done during Ramadan. (see below) ;Prayers done for specific occasions Salat ul istasqa is a prayer to ask God for rain. Kusuf is done during a solar eclipse; Khusuf during a lunar eclipse. (see below) ;Sunnah prayer which are done at the same time as regular compulsory prayer According to Sohaib Sultan, the Islamic prophet Muhammad performed Sunnah prayer \\"before and/or after every obligatory prayer\\" to gain more blessings and benefits from Allah. Examples of these Sunnah mu’akkadah or \\"confirmed\\" sunnah prayer, as established in the Hanafi school of fiqh, (according to Faraz Rabbani) include: * \\"2 rakats before Fajr\\" * \\"4 rakats before Zuhr and 2 after\\" * \\"4 rakats before Asr\\" * \\"2 rakats after Maghrib\\" * \\"2 rakats after Isha\\" These sunnah prayer don't have a special name. Fajr, Zuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha are all names of compulsory prayers. A rakat -- also rakʿah ( ', ; plural: ') -- is the movement from standing, to bowing on the floor, to standing again, that is part of every salat prayer. =Confirmed and non-confirmed prayers= Another division between non- obligatory prayers is whether they are \\"confirmed\\" or \\"unconfirmed\\": *Sunnah mu’akkadah or \\"confirmed sunna\\" prayers, which Muhammad \\"continuously performed and almost never abandoned\\" (according to tradition). Examples of Sunnah mu’akkadah include \\"Eid prayer, or the two rakat after the maghrib prayer\\". *Ghair mu’akkadah or \\"non-confirmed sunnas\\". These Muhammad was not as fastidious in performing as he sometimes performed them \\"and sometimes abandoned\\" them. An example of ghair mu’akkadah is two rakat before the Isha prayer. These two kinds of prayer have \\"different terminology and rulings\\". ;Some examples of unconfirmed sunnah prayers are: *4 rakats after Zuhr (either by making the 2 confirmed sunna rakats 4, or separately), *4 or 2 rakats before Asr *6 rakats (salat al-awwabin) after Maghrib, ideally in sets of two (the confirmed sunna can be included as part of the 6 if one chooses) *2 rakats before Isha *4 rakats after isha (one can include the confirmed sunnas in this if one wishes). (When the prayers duplicate the confirmed sunnahs mentioned above they can be included with the confirmed sunnah prayers or not.) =Sunnah of prayer= Sunnah prayer is not to be confused with Sunnahs of prayer. Not only are there obligatory and optional types of prayer, but obligatory and optional parts (words and actions) of a prayer (at least for conservative Salafi Muslims such as Muhammad Salih al-Munajjid). Examples of obligatory and \\"pillar\\" words and actions include: i. Standing during obligatory prayers if one is able to do so; ii. The opening takbeer i.e. saying “Allaahu akbar”; iii. Reciting al-Faatihah at the beginning of the rakat Examples of sunnah words and actions include: i. Saying after the opening takbeer, “Subhaanaka Allaahumma wa bi hamdika, wa tabaaraka ismuka, wa ta’aala jadduka wa laa ilaaha ghayruka (Glory and praise be to You, O Allaah; blessed be Your name, exalted be Your Majesty, and there is no god but You).” This is called du’aa’ al-istiftaah (opening du’aa’) ii. Seeking refuge with Allaah iii. Saying Bismillaah iv. Saying Ameen Omitting these does not invalidate the prayer. Tahajjud Muslims performing Sunnah Salah after Jumua'ah Salaat at Orient Islamic School Hall in KZN Durban South Africa on Friday 2014.01.24 Tahajjud () prayer is performed at night time, and it is recommended that it be performed after first going to sleep for a part of the night. Scholars have different opinions about whether sleeping first is absolutely required or not. In Saudi Arabia during the fasting month of Ramadan, there are many people who leave the Tarawih prayers in the main masjid in a hurry so that they can go home, go to sleep, and then wake up to perform their Tahajjud prayers in the early morning. Others simply stay in the mosque and perform these optional prayers before going home. The time for the Tahajjud prayers falls between the prayer times of the isha'a prayers and the fajr prayers. It is also recommended that the prayers be done in the last third of the night. Muslims believe that the reward is greater for those who do this prayer at a later time. (It is harder to wake up and pray early in the morning, making the person's effort greater, resulting in a greater reward from God.) Each prayer for a Muslim is made up with repeated actions and at least one rakat. The Tahajjud prayer consists of a minimum of one rakat and the maximum number 11. Some say 13 but any number more than 13 is a bidah (Innovation); for there is no hadeeth; that is saheeh (strong) showing that Muhammad exceeding more than 13 rakats (according to Abu ‘Abdullah Muhammad ibn Nasr al-Marwazee) :It is reported about the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him and give him peace) that he said: \\"Adhere to night prayer, for it is the habit of the righteous before you, and a means of drawing nearer to your Lord; it is an expiation for sins, and a deterrent from wrongdoing.\\" [Tirmidhi & al-Hakim] :Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As (Allah be pleased with him) relates that the Messenger of Allah (Allah be pleased with him) said to him, \\"O Abdullah, do not be like so-and-so, he used to pray in the night then he abandoned night prayer.\\" [Bukhari & Muslim] It is recommended that tahajjud be prayed during the last third of the night, but performing it at any other time is better than not performing it at all. Tarawih Tarawih prayer at Taipei Grand Mosque, Taiwan. Tarawih () is a sunnah muakada night prayer during Ramadan. It is prayer that is only done during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. It can be done alone, in a group, at home, or in a mosque or other public meeting area it does not matter. Typically, Muslims gather together and perform tarawih as a group, often amongst extended family members in one large house. Others may meet in their local mosque, a meeting hall, or even in an outdoor field. Depending on the country, the tarawih prayers might be done in mosque by men only, or by a mixture of men and women (although physically separated from each other). The number of rakat of Tarawih salah is Twenty. Muhammad was afraid that if he continued to perform the prayers in the mosque, then his followers might come to think that they were compulsory and not optional. After Muhammad, Taraweeh was Still prayed by 20 rakats. The issue that people make that he prayed 8 is about Tahajjud (salah ). In the main mosque in Mecca, the Imam (prayer leader) performs twenty rakat and then you pray your isha witr prayers. The total number of people joining the tarawih prayers in the main mosque in Mecca may reach 3-4 million. They fill up all levels inside the mosque, the flat roof, outside in the courtyard, some nearby streets (which are closed off), and on occasions even using up space in the lobbies of some nearby hotels. It is also customary for the Imam in any mosque to recite the entire contents of the Qur'an during the fasting month by reading approximately one section per day. This practice of reading the Qur'an completely is known as khatm (complete recitation). Istisqa Salat ul istasqa () is a prayer to ask God for rain. It consisting of two rakat. According to Ibn Qudaamah said: \\"Prayer for rain is a confirmed Sunnah, proven by the practice of the Messenger of Allah ... and of his successors \\"al-Mughni by Ibn Qudaamah, 2/148, quoted in The imam prays, with the followers, two rakat during any time except those times in which it is not desirable to pray. In the first rakat, the imam recites Sura Al-A'la after Sura Al-Fatiha. And in the second rakat, he reads Sura Al- Ghashiyah after Al-Fatihah, and he delivers a khutbah before or after the salah. As soon as he finishes the khutbah (sermon), people face the qiblah (direction of prayer) and supplicate to Allah. It was first introduced in Medina in the month of Ramadan of 6th Hijrah. There are a number of hadith of Muhammad talking about praying for rain. Ash-Shaf'i states that it has been related from Salim ibn 'Abdullah, on the authority of his father that Muhammad would say for ishsqa': > \\"O Allah, give us a saving rain, productive, plentiful, general, continuous. > O Allah, give us rain and do not make us among the despondent. O Allah, > (Your) slaves, land, animals, and (Your) creation all are suffering and seek > protection. And we do not complain except to You. O Allah, let our crops > grow, and let the udders be refilled. Give us from the blessings of the sky > and grow for us from the blessings of the earth. O Allah, remove from us the > hardship, starvation,and barrenness and remove the affliction from us as no > one removes afflictions save Thee. O Allah, we seek Your forgiveness as You > are the Forgiving, and send upon us plenteous rains.\\" Ash-Shaf'i said: \\"I > prefer that the imam would supplicate with that (prayer).\\" Sa'd reported that for ishsqa', Muhammad would supplicate: \\"O Allah, let us be covered with thick clouds that have abundant and beneficial rain, frequently making a light rain upon us and sprinkling upon us with lightning. O Allah, You are full of majesty, bounty and Honour.\\" This is related by Abu 'Awanah in his Sahih. 'Amr ibn Shuaib relates from his father, on the authority of his grandfather, that for istisqa', Muhammad would say: \\"O Allah, provide water for Your slaves and Your cattle, display Your mercy and give life to Your dead lands.\\" This is related by Abu Dawud. It is preferred for the one who is making this supplication to raise his hands with the back of his hands toward the sky. Muslim records from Anas that Muhammad would point with the back of his hands during ishsqa. It is also preferred, upon seeing the rain, to say: \\"O Allah, make it a beneficial rain\\" and he should uncover part of his body to the rain. On the other hand, if one fears that there is too much rain, one should say: \\"O Allah give us mercy and do not give us punishment, calamities, destruction or flooding. O Allah, make it upon the woods, farms and trees. Make it around us and not upon us.\\" Kusuf and Khusuf (Solar and Lunar Eclipse) Salat ul-Kusuf () is a prayer offered during a solar eclipse; Salat ul-Khusuf () is performed during a lunar eclipse. They are both Nafl (non- obligatory) with two rakat prayers that should be performed by the Muslim community in congregation.http://islam.about.com/cs/prayer/a/eclipse.htm Two or four Rakat (Units) of Khusuf salah are offered in a Jama'ah (Group) or individually, with individual prayers preferred.Ar-Risala by Ibn Abi Zaid al- Qayrawani Neither Adhan (Call for Prayers) nor Iqamah (Second Call for Prayers) is called for Khusuf salah. Recitation of the Quran during Khusuf salah can be done either silently or loudly. During the time of Muhammad, there was a solar eclipse. People hurried to link this to a worldly event, namely, the death of Muhammad's son, Ibrahim. Muhammad explained the truth of this matter to them. In his Sahih (authentic hadith), Imam Muslim reported that \`A'ishah (rali) said: > There was a solar eclipse in the time of the Messenger of Allah. He stood up > to pray and prolonged his standing very much. He then bowed and prolonged > very much his bowing. He then raised his head and prolonged his standing > much, but it was less than the (duration) of the first standing. He then > bowed and prolonged bowing much, but it was less than the duration of his > first bowing. He then prostrated and then stood up and prolonged the > standing, but it was less than the first standing. He then bowed and > prolonged his bowing, but it was less than the first bowing. He then lifted > his head and then stood up and prolonged his standing, but it was less than > the first standing. He then bowed and prolonged bowing and it was less than > the first bowing. He then prostrated himself; then he turned about, and the > sun had become bright, and he addressed the people. He praised Allah and > lauded Him and said: \\"The sun and the moon are two signs of Allah; they are > not eclipsed on account of anyone's death or on account of anyone's birth. > So when you see them, glorify and supplicate Allah, observe the Prayer, give > alms. O Ummah of Muhammad, none is more indignant than Allah when His > servant or maid commits fornication. O people of Muhammad, by Allah, if you > knew what I know, you would weep much and laugh little.

Their only serious rivals were the Kęsgailos, and from the end of the 15th century the fast rising in power and influence Radvila family clan. It appears from the Latin original spelling of their name Gastoldus which is a variation of castaldius that they had been close to the Grand Dukes and that their function was to oversee ducal demesne. Most power family gained during the reign of Casimir Jagiellon. The castaldius of Vytautas, Andrius Goštautas might have been a voivode of Vilnius and Kreva, and father of Jonas, appears to have been the precursor of the family growth. The majority of the family's possessions (lands) were in the western part of the Duchy and eastern ethnic Lithuania. After the death of the last scion of the family, Stanislovas Goštautas, the Polish King and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund II Augustus inherited his possessions as a matter of right, per Grand Duchy of Lithuania law.

It intergrades with other subspecies of Elaphe obsoleta, so exact range boundaries are impossible to distinguish. The epithet lindheimeri is to honor the German-American naturalist Ferdinand Jacob Lindheimer, who collected the first specimen in New Braunfels, Texas.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Pantherophis obsoletus lindheimeri, p. 158). Description The Texas rat snake is a medium to large snake, capable of attaining lengths of 4-5 ft. They vary greatly in color and patterning throughout their range, but they are typically yellow or tan, with brown to olive-green, irregular blotching from head to tail. Specimens from the southern area of their range tend to have more yellow, while those from the northern range tend to be darker. One way to distinguish them from other rat snakes is they are the only ones with a solid grey head. Some specimens have red or orange speckling. The belly is typically a solid gray or white in color. The several naturally occurring color variations include albinos, high orange or hypomelanistic, and a few specimens which display leucism, which have become regularly captive-bred and are popular in the pet trade. The Texas rat snake becomes very black with white spots in some specimens caught in Sabine County, Texas, which reflects the northern intergrade of the black rat snake. Behavior Texas rat snakes are relatively timid for such a large snake, but they are extremely variable in temperament. Adults can be mild-tempered – exhibiting mouth gaping and biting when approached. Juveniles less than a year old may either be very docile or bite when disturbed. One of their defensive behaviors involves 'rattling' or rapidly whipping the end of their tails back and forth against anything nearby to create a rattling sound. They also have an awful-smelling musk compared to other snakes. They eat readily in captivity and will eat thawed frozen mice and rats. Wild-caught specimens generally eventually become docile in captivity. Diet The Texas rat snake has a voracious appetite, consuming large numbers of rodents and birds, and sometimes lizards, soft-bodied insects, and frogs, which they subdue with constriction. They are generalists, found in a wide range of habitats from swamps to forests to grasslands, even in urban areas. They are agile climbers, able to reach bird nests with relative ease.\\"Elaphe obsoleta,\\" Herps of Texas (accessed May 7, 2010). They are often found around farmland, and sometimes consume fledgling chickens and eggs, which leads them to be erroneously called the chicken snake. Taxonomy All North American rat snake species have been suggested for reclassification to the genus Pantherophis. A further revision of Pantherophis obsoletus has recommended the elimination of the various subspecies entirely, considering them all to be merely locality variations. However, the ICZN has rejected the renaming, thus Elaphe remains the generally accepted generic name.

She was formerly signed under King Records' sub-label Venus-B and Taku Takahashi's Tachytelic Records. She is best known for writing songs for Heartsdales and for her collaborations with M-Flo. As of 2011, Hinouchi has released twelve singles, three studio length albums, and collaborated with numerous artists. Biography Emi Hinouchi was born in Osaka, Japan. She lived in Taiwan from the age of 4 to 14. It was then that Hinouchi grew an interest in global and Japanese music. After returning to Japan, she started composing music and writing lyrics, eventually completing the song \\"Painful\\" at the age of 16. After that, she performed at several gigs as a vocalist with an indie band from Osaka. She presented the song \\"Painful\\" at an audition held by Taku Takahashi of M-Flo, one of her favorite artists and influences, and won the audition. In 2002, she made her major debut on Takahashi's label, Tachytelic Records, with the double A-side single \\"Magic/World\\". Her first album Dramatiques was released in 2003. Following the release of Dramatiques, Hinouchi spent the next several years collaborating with several major Japanese artists, such as M-Flo, SOUL'd OUT, Crystal Kay, Heartsdales and Teriyaki Boyz. She has also provided backup vocals for M-Flo and written a number of their songs, such as \\"Luvotomy\\", \\"Simple & Lovely\\", and \\"Love Don't Cry\\". Hinouchi was featured on songs such as \\"Summer Time Love\\" with fellow singer Ryohei Yamamoto, and \\"Love Comes and Goes\\" with Yoshika, Emyli, Lisa, and Ryohei on M-Flo's compilation album, \\"Award Supernova: Loves Best\\". She has also collaborated with Korean hip-hip group Epik High for the song \\"Flow\\". Hinouchi began a string of her own solo releases in 2007, starting with the single \\"O'kay.\\" Following four singles, she released her second album, ME..., in 2008. According to a blog entry made by Hinouchi herself, King Records, the distributor of the album, dropped her from the label after it failed to sell enough copies.\\"Hahaha\\" (Japanese) Although no longer a part of King Records and Tachytelic Records, Hinouchi continued to collaborate with other artists such as DJ Komori, Hiromi, Azu, and Emyli. In 2011, she began writing music for solo releases again, albeit as an independent artist. Her first single since leaving King Records and Tachytelic Records, \\"Sotsugyō -congratulations-\\" (), was released on February 6, 2011.

It features a riddling exchange between a schoolboy and a \\"false knight,\\" the devil in disguise.Francis James Child, English and Scottish Popular Ballads, \\"The Fause Knight Upon the Road\\" Synopsis Across numerous versions differing significantly in lyric content, the consistent themes are: * The knight asks the boy where he is going, and what he is carrying (books). * He asks after the sheep, which belong to the boy and his mother, and how many belong to the knight—as many as have blue tails. * The knight may wish him in a tree, the boy to have a ladder, the knight to have it break, and so on. * Throughout any exchange, the boy is described as stood/standing fast/still. This appears to be the condition that will save him.

History and profile The magazine was bi-monthly and lasted for seven issues. The headquarters was in New York City and the publisher was Harris Publications. It was presented as an edgier alternative to magazines such as EGM and GamePro. Notable recurring departments included \\"Don't Ever Do This,\\" which offered explicit instructions for pranks and antisocial behavior, and \\"Babewatch,\\" which was merely photos of attractive females from TV shows, movies, and comic books. Starting with issue #4, the publisher began releasing two different editions of the magazine, one for the newsstand and the other for the direct market / comic book shops.

Gall Jr.; February 12, 1902 – February 5, 1987) was an American stage performer, producer, and a film actor who in the silent and sound eras was cast in no less than 89 motion pictures. Biography William Collier (nicknamed \\"Buster\\") was born in New York City. When his parents divorced, his mother, the actress Paula Marr, remarried the actor William Collier Sr. who adopted Charles (the two did share a resemblance) and gave the boy the new name William Collier Jr. Collier's acting experience in childhood, having first appeared on stage at age seven, helped him get his first movie role at age 14 in The Bugle Call (1916). He later became a popular leading man in the 1920s and successfully made the transition from silent into sound film. Nevertheless, he retired from acting in 1935, and in 1937 traveled to England to work as a movie producer. He returned to the United States in the late 1940s and began producing drama series for television. In February 1960, in recognition of his contributions to the entertainment industry, Collier received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

They are known from fossil remains found throughout the late Cretaceous period of North America, though only one species, Ichthyornis dispar, is represented by complete enough fossils to have been named. Ichthyornitheans became extinct at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, along with enantiornitheans, all other non-avian dinosaurs, and many other animal and plant groups. Origin and evolution The earliest known ichthyornitheans appear in the fossil record about 95 million years ago, during the Cenomanian age of the Late Cretaceous. Based on fragmentary fossil remains, the two known species present in the Ashville Formation have not been given names, but overall were very similar to Ichthyornis dispar. I. dispar itself had a very long temporal range, and specimens referred to it or very similar species existed relatively unchanged (other than some fluctuations in average adult size) for nearly 10 million years, when species referable to I. dispar disappeared and were replaced by other, though still somewhat similar, species of ichthyornitheans. The fact that ichthyornitheans appear to have existed virtually unchanged in their general size and anatomy for nearly the entire duration of the late Cretaceous period suggests that their evolutionary pace was in relative stasis compared to other, contemporary species of closely related avialans, like the hesperornitheans. Both the ichthyornitheans and hesperornitheans were strongly linked to their ecosystem in the Western Interior Seaway that bisected North America for much of the Cretaceous. It may be that while the flightless, aquatic hesperornitheans were much more sensitive to changes in shoreline extent and sea level during that time, driving their evolution and adaptation into more specialized forms, the flying, tern-like ichthyornitheans were not as dependent on specific coastal or sea-level conditions, and they were able to inhabit basically the same ecological niche for a very long period. The icthyornithean lineage finally became extinct in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that caused the extinction of many major land and marine animal groups at the end of the Mesozoic era. The last ichthyornithean fossils are found in the Hell Creek Formation very close (within 300,000 years at least) of the K-Pg boundary, dated to 66 million years old. The study describing Protodontopteryx notes some \\"striking\\" similarities between the jaw structure of Ichthyornithes and pelagornithids. The study still classifies pelagornithids as neognaths based on a few post-cranial features and recovers them in a polytomy with Galloanserae and Neoaves, but does note that this link is worth investigating and that the pelagornithid palate is not known.G. Mayr, V. L. De Pietri, L. Love, A. Mannering, and R. P. Scofield. 2019. Oldest, smallest, and phylogenetically most basal pelagornithid, from the early Paleocene of New Zealand, sheds light on the evolutionary history of the largest flying birds. Papers in Palaeontology Classification Ichthyornitheans were close to the ancestry of modern birds, the crown group Aves, but represents an independent lineage of toothed seabird-like animals. It was long believed that several similar Cretaceous species known from fragmentary remains, including Ambiortus, Apatornis, Iaceornis and Guildavis, were members of the Ichthyornithes in addition to the group's namesake, Ichthyornis. However, these seem to have been more closely related to modern birds than to Ichthyornis dispar. In Julia Clarke's 2004 review of Ichthyornis-like fossils, the former order Ichthyornithiformes and the family Ichthyornithidae were considered synonyms of the clade Ichthyornithes, which in that paper was defined according to phylogenetic taxonomy as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of Ichthyornis dispar and modern birds. =Species= Ichthyornis dispar, known from the Niobrara Formation of Kansas, is currently the only valid species of ichthyornithean that is well-supported enough by distinctive fossil evidence to have received a name. However, isolated remains of other ichthyornithean species have been identified. For example, three isolated shoulder bone specimens (RSM P2992.1, UCMP 187207, AMNH 22002) found in the Hell Creek Formation of Montana, Lance Formation of Wyoming, and Frenchman Formation of Saskatchewan have been identified as all belonging to a single species of Ichthyornis-like avialan that inhabited this region of North America at the very end of the Maastrichtian age, within 300,000 years of the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. Another unnamed species similar to Ichthyornis is known from isolated remains found in Campanian-age rocks from Alberta. Two more species also represented only by fossil shoulder bones are known from the Cenomanian-age Ashville Formation near Carrot River, Saskatchewan. Though originally thought to be species of Ichthyornis, they probably represent one or more new genera. Additional ichthyornithean remains have been described from Russia, suggesting that this group ranged across much of the northern hemisphere in the Cenomanian.Nikita V. Zelenkov, Alexander O.

The club is the second most successful Libyan club in history after Al-Ittihad, having won 12 Libyan Premier League titles, 6 Libyan Cups and 2 Libyan SuperCups. Alahly is known as the leader of Libyan Football clubs and has the largest number of fans in Libya. The club's crest consists of a green and white background, with a torch placed on an outline of Libya. The torch is meant to signify independence for the nation, as it was achieved just months after the club was founded. The club's crest changed after it won its 10th Libyan Premier League title in 2000, with a star being placed on top. Alahli's main rivalry is with Al-Ittihad. The two clubs are the biggest in the country, and together, have won 28 of the 45 national championships that have been contested, as well as 10 of the 18 domestic cups. The rivalry's name is the Tripoli Derby. The club won the first national championship in the 1963–64 season, but then suffered a period of seven years until its next win in 1970–71. The club won two of the next three titles, and picked up the last before the cancellation of the league in 1977–78. The 1980s was a very dire period for the club, as their own failure, coupled with Al Ittihad's success, meant that their rivals went into the 1990s with six titles to their own five. However, they reach the final of the African Cup Winners' Cup in 1984, where they withdrew from facing Al-Ahly Cairo, as the bad Libyan relationship with Egypt at that time meant that Libyan clubs were banned from facing Egyptian clubs. Foundation In the middle of the 20th century, Libya, a country still looking for its independence, started to found many sporting clubs and youth clubs in a political move to unite the youth of the country in order to fight for its independence, and drive out the British forces. A young group of youngsters from Tripoli decided to name their club Al Istiqlal, meaning Independence, but the British administration, uncomfortable with this name as it may have caused a revolt against their power, refused it. The club was therefore named Alahly, meant as The People's Club, and chose the club's colours as green to signify independence, peace and hope for the country.

It is an instrumental piece, mainly the brainchild of member Benny Andersson and had the working titles of \\"Fiol\\", \\"Ode to Dalecarlia\\" and \\"Arrival in Dalecarlia\\".  Background  \\"Arrival\\" was the second and last composition from the group not to contain lyrics, following \\"Intermezzo No.1\\" the previous year. As with \\"Intermezzo No.1\\", the choral tune, heavily influenced by traditional Swedish folk music, was written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus. It was recorded on 30 August 1976 at Stockholm's Metronome Studio. The title of the album, Arrival, gave the instrumental its name, rather than vice versa. It was also one of the last tracks to be recorded for the album before its release on 11 October 1976. In 1983, a different version of the song with lyrics, called \\"Belle\\", was sung by Daniel Balavoine and Anni-Frid Lyngstad (\\"Frida\\") as part of the French musical ABBAcadabra. Also in 1983, it was re-recorded with different lyrics, and released as \\"Time\\" by B. A. Robertson and Lyngstad.

He plays through the entire medley 3 times in all, with increasingly more backup and percussion each time. Also, he has transposed these tunes to the key of G, whereas they are more commonly played in D.

She persuades her sister to go to the woods with her, and escapes her with her lover Willie. They are attacked, by knights or outlaws, but he fights and kills them all, and they escape. In the Robin Hood variant, Robin sees a woman walking in the woods and persuades her to run away with him; unlike the other variants, they are not already lovers and she does not need to escape her father.

Kansas Army National Guard units are trained and equipped as part of the United States Army. The same ranks and insignia are used and National Guardsmen are eligible to receive all United States military awards. The Kansas Guard also bestows a number of state awards for local services rendered in or to the state of Kansas. It is, along with the Kansas Air National Guard, an element of the Kansas National Guard. History The forerunner of the Kansas National Guard, the Kansas Territorial Militia, was formed on August 30, 1855. On January 29, 1861, six years after the formation of the territorial militia, Kansas became the 34th state and the state militia was organized into units of the Kansas National Guard. Article 8, Section 4 of the Kansas Constitution designates the Governor of Kansas as the commander in chief for state duties. The U.S. Congress passed the Militia Act of 1903, which organized the various state militias into the present National Guard system. The Kansas Army National Guard has been involved in the nation’s conflicts since the state’s inception as a territory. The Kansas Guard actively participated in the Civil War, 1861–1865; the Indian Wars, 1864–1870; Spanish–American War, 1898–1899; and the Pancho Villa Expedition of 1916; and the First World War, 1917–1919. The 2nd Infantry Regiment of the Kansas Volunteer Militia was organized from existing units in 1880. The regiment was mustered into federal service in June 1916 for duty guarding the Mexican Border against invasion. The regiment served for five months at Eagle Pass, Texas. In August 1917, the 2nd Infantry Regiment was drafted into federal service. The Kansas National Guard supplied troops to the 35th Infantry Division when it was organized in August 1917 as a formation with troops from Kansas and Missouri. The 2nd Infantry Regiment was consolidated with the 1st Infantry Regiment and re-designated the 137th Infantry Regiment, Kansas National Guard and assigned to the 35th Division. The regiment saw duty in France and participated in the Meuse-Argonne offensive. The 137th Infantry Regiment were demobilized in May 1919, after 34 months of active duty service. In November 1921, the 2nd Infantry Regiment was re-designated as the 161st Field Artillery Regiment and assigned to the 35th Division. In 1918, Kansas Army National Guard Lieutenant Erwin R. Bleckley, who volunteered for aviation duty, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during an aerial sortie during World War I. He was the first National Guard aviator to earn the award and one of only three to earn it during the 20th century. Units of the Kansas Army National Guard fought in World War II and the Korean War from 1950 to 1952, when the 130th Field Artillery Group headquarters, the 195th Field Artillery Battalion, and the 174th Military Police Battalion were mobilized. In 1963, the 69th Infantry Brigade was activated as part of the Kansas Army National Guard. During the Vietnam War, the brigade, less the 3rd Battalion of the 137th Infantry, was ordered to active duty in May 1968. The brigade served at Fort Carson attached to the 5th Infantry Division until its demobilization in December 1969. The brigade was used to provide replacements for troops in Vietnam. 40 men of the brigade were killed in action, with hundreds being wounded.69th Infantry Brigade: The 1968 Mobilization, from \\"THE BATTLE OF FORT CARSON, VIETNAM AND RETURN,\\" the program for 69th Infantry Brigade (Separate).

In the mid 1980s, two new Army National Guard divisions were formed, drawing on existing independent brigades. The headquarters of the 35th Infantry Division was reformed by the Kansas Army National Guard. The 69th Infantry Brigade joined the new division, alongside brigades from Nebraska and Kentucky. In the late 1980s, aviation regiments were formed within the U.S. Army and the Army National Guard. The state maintained the 69th Infantry Brigade as part of the 35th Infantry Division from the 1980s to the 1990s or later. Kansas Army National Guardsmen during an exercise, February 26, 2011 Kansas Army National Guard personnel also saw service during Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm, 1990–1991; Operations Northern and Southern Watch in Southwest Asia, 1992–2002; Operation Restore Hope in Somalia, 1992–1993; Operations Joint Endeavor, Deny Flight and Joint Guardian in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 1995–2003; Operations Phoenix Scorpion, Phoenix Scorpion III and Desert Fox in Southwest Asia, 1997 and 1998; Operation Allied Force in Kosovo, 1999–present; Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Noble Eagle, 2001–present; and Operation Iraqi Freedom, 2003–2011, Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa 2010–2011. The 635th Armor Regiment was constituted in the Air National Guard on March 25, 1953 as the 891st Engineer Aviation Battalion. On August 1, 1953 it was allotted to the Kansas National Guard. It was reorganized and federally recognized January 13, 1954 with headquarters at Manhattan, Kansas. The regiment was redesignated in January 1957 as the 891st Engineer Battalion. It was converted again to the 635th Armor on February 1, 1976, consisting of the 1st Battalion. In 1984 the battalion was part of the 69th Infantry Brigade. It was reorganized again on March 1, 1990 to comprise the 1st and 2nd Battalions at Manhattan and Salina, respectively. About 350 soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 635th Armor, departed on the first leg of a deployment to Kosovo on October 27, 2004 as part of NATO’s peacekeeping operation in the former Yugoslavia. On January 27, 2006 they returned from their 15-month deployment to Kosovo. While there, they had provided force protection and fixed and roving security, as well as escort duty. The Kansas Army National Guard is commanded by Brigadier General Anthony V. Mohatt. Its chief of staff is Colonel Matt Oleen, and its command sergeant major is Howard Whitley.

John Lothropp's namesake great-great-grandson, see Rev. John Lathrop (American minister). Rev. John Lothropp (1584–1653) — sometimes spelled Lothrop or Lathrop — was an English Anglican clergyman, who became a Congregationalist minister and emigrant to New England. He was among the first settlers of Barnstable, Massachusetts. Perhaps Lothropp's principal claim to fame is that he was a strong proponent of the idea of the Separation of Church and State (also called \\"Freedom of Religion\\"). This idea was considered heretical in England during his time, but eventually became the mainstream view of people in the United States of America, because of the efforts of John Lothropp and others. Lothropp left an indelible mark on the culture of New England, and through that, upon the rest of the country. He has had many notable descendants, including at least six US presidents, as well as many other prominent Governors, government leaders, leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and business people. Biography =Early life= Lothropp was born in Etton, East Riding of Yorkshire. He was baptised on 20 December 1584. He attended Queens' College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1601, graduated with a BA in 1605, and with an MA in 1609. =Ministry and incarceration= He was ordained in the Church of England and appointed curate of a local parish in Egerton, Kent. In 1623 he renounced his orders and joined the cause of the Independents. Lothropp gained prominence in 1624, when he was called to replace Reverend Henry Jacob as the pastor of the First Independent Church in London, a congregation of sixty members which met at Southwark. Church historians sometimes call this church the Jacob-Lathrop- Jessey (JLJ) Church, named for its first three pastors, Henry Jacob, John Lothropp and Henry Jessey. They were forced to meet in private to avoid the scrutiny of Bishop of London William Laud. Following the group's discovery on 22 April 1632 by officers of the king, forty-two of Lothropp's Independents were arrested. Only eighteen escaped capture. The arrested were prosecuted for failure to take the oath of loyalty to the established church. Evidence gleaned by the historians Burrage and Kiffin and from the Jessey records indicate many were jailed in The Clink prison. As for Reverend John Lothropp, the question is still unresolved. English historian Samuel Rawson Gardiner, whose book Reports of Cases in the Courts of Star Chamber and High Commission, gives an account of the courtroom trial and cites information from the trial record that the convicted dissenters were to be divided up and sent to various prisons. Historian E. B. Huntington suggests Lothropp was incarcerated in either the Clink or Newgate.A plaque in the Lothrop Hill Cemetery in Barnstable, Massachusetts, the town which John Lothropp settled and where he died, states he was incarcerated in Newgate Prison during the years 1632-1634. The National Archives at London which would hold the records for Newgate Prison indicate they have nothing earlier than 1770. The lack of documentation is attributable to the Great London Fire (1666), the Gordon Riots (1780), and the fact that upon the abolition of the Star Chamber in 1641, the court proceedings of the reign of Charles I deteriorated and failed to survive. A report to the Lords in 1719 noted that those documents were \\"in a very great heap, undigested, and without any covering from dust or security from rats and mice. \\"As for records of the Clink, the National Archives indicates they would be held at the London Metropolitan Archives, but those records start from 1690. The National Archives states that records from these earlier times are also not complete due to the fact that they were not created or kept for research purposes, but for use by the government or law courts of the day. Further, it may be that Lothropp actually served time in both prisons since it was customary to move prisoners from one prison to another due to space availability. In the end, the precise location of Lothropp's imprisonment is not confirmable from primary documentation. While Lothropp was in prison, his wife Hannah House became ill and died. His six surviving children were, according to tradition, left to fend for themselves begging for bread on the streets of London. Friends, being unable to care for his children, brought them to the Bishop who had charge of Lothropp. After about a year, all were released on bail except Lothropp, who was deemed too dangerous to be set at liberty. The Bishop ultimately released him on bond in May 1634 with the understanding that he would immediately remove to the New World. Since he did not immediately leave for the New World, a court order was subsequently put out for him. Family tradition and other historical reflections indicate he then \\"escaped.\\" =Emigration= Lothropp was told that he would be pardoned upon acceptance of terms to leave England permanently with his family along with as many of his congregation members as he could take who would not accept the authority of the Church of England. Lathrop accepted the terms of the offer and left for Plymouth, Massachusetts. With his group, he sailed on the Griffin and arrived in Boston on 18 September 1634.The State Papers in the new Record Office, Fetter Lane, London, preserved some of the Star Chamber records of John Lothropp's imprisoned days. The last record probably was the order of the court which opened the way for his escape to America. However, according to the National Archives, this office has not been in use since the 1860s and State Papers are now held at the National Archives. The record found on page 71 of Governor Winthrop's Journal, quotes John Lothropp, a freeman, rejoicing in finding a \\"church without a bishop. . .and a state without a king.\\" John Lothropp married Ann (surname unknown) (1616–1687)Great Migration 1634-1635, I-L.

John Lothrop pages 345 - 351. Lothropp did not stay in Boston long. Within days, he and his group relocated to Scituate where they \\"joined in covenaunt together\\" along with nine others who preceded them to form the \\"church of Christ collected att Scituate.\\"Huntington, 1884 p27 The Congregation at Scituate was not a success. Dissent on the issue of baptism as well as other unspecified grievances and the lack of good grazing land and fodder for their cattle caused the church in Scituate to split in 1638. Lothropp petitioned Governor Thomas Prence in Plymouth for a \\"place for the transplanting of us, to the end that God might have more glory and wee more comfort.\\"Otis, 1888 p198 Thus as Otis says \\"Mr. Lothropp and a large company arrived in Barnstable, 11 October 1639 O.S., bringing with them the crops which they had raised in Scituate.\\"Otis, 1888 p198 There, within three years they had built homes for all the families and then Lothropp began construction on a larger, sturdier meeting house adjacent to Coggin's (or Cooper's) Pond, which was completed in 1644. This building, now part of the Sturgis Library in Barnstable, Massachusetts is one of John Lothrop's original homes and meeting houses, and is now also the oldest building housing a public library in the USA. Genealogy =Children= Lothropp married Hannah House/Howse in England, on 10 October 1610.

Early life and education Born to Carol Leebron and Norman Leebron in 1955, David Leebron was raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. An Eagle Scout, Leebron was influenced by a steady stream of exchange students in his house—from Europe, Japan and Mexico—to develop an interest in international affairs. He later traveled to Germany as an exchange student himself and speaks German. Leebron earned a Bachelors, summa cum laude, in History and Science from Harvard College in 1976, and his JD, magna cum laude, from Harvard Law School in 1979, where he was president of the Harvard Law Review, notably working with the future Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.  Career  = Early career = After graduating from Harvard Law, Leebron clerked for Judge Shirley Hufstedler in Los Angeles at the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. He taught as a professor at the UCLA School of Law for a semester. Leebron then entered private practice from 1981 to 1983 as an associate at the New York firm Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton. He then re-entered academia as a law professor at New York University and the director of NYU's International Legal Studies Program from 1983 to 1989. In 1989 he joined the faculty at Columbia Law School, where he became dean in 1996. He became President of Rice University in 2004. As a professor, he taught and published in areas of corporate finance, international economic law, human rights, privacy and torts.

He was known for recruiting promising junior faculty. =Rice University= Leebron became the 7th President of Rice University on the first of June in 2004. Under Leebron’s leadership, the campus has added two new residential colleges; the 10-story BioScience Research Collaborative, where scientists and educators from Rice and other Texas Medical Center institutions work together; a new recreation and wellness center; an additional food servery; a central campus pavilion that serves as a meeting and study place; an updated sports arena; a new physics building; and the Public Art Program, a presidential initiative that has added art across campus, although the University suffered a disappointing setback when merger talks between Baylor College of Medicine and Rice stalled. As president, Leebron has pushed the creation of a vision for the University, called the Vision for the Second Century.http://cohesion.rice.edu/administration/presidentsoffice/v2c/V2C_Participate.cfm?CFID=14106490&CFTOKEN;=37240967 Leebron set forth a plan for expansion, calling for opinions from the Rice community. The vision calls for expanding the undergraduate body to around 3800, adding two more residential colleges and expanding the current ones. The new students will mostly come from outside Texas, while the number of students from Texas holds steady at around 1300 students. In November 2008, Leebron traveled to Iran as part of an academic tour sponsored by the Association of American Universities. On this four-day tour, he visited Sharif University, Iran's top engineering school, where he took part in an open question and answer session with Iranian students.

The highway is a more direct route to Fort Walton Beach from points north. With flyover ramps at both intersections of SR 85 now completed, the highway has been widened into a 4-lane divided highway. Route description SR 123 begins at an intersection with SR 85 north of Northwest Florida Regional Airport to the southwest of Niceville in Okaloosa County, heading north-northeast on two-lane undivided Roger J. Clary Highway. The road passes through forested areas on the grounds of Eglin Air Force Base, bypassing Niceville to the west. SR 123 reaches its northern terminus at another intersection with SR 85 northwest of Niceville.  History  Construction work on the $25.6 million State Road (S.R.) 85/123 flyover project in Okaloosa County is complete. The main feature of the project is a new flyover ramp that seamlessly connects S.R. 85 northbound to S.R. 123 northbound. The project also includes widening S.R. 85 to six lanes between General Bond Boulevard and the Northwest Florida Regional Airport. In addition, the travel lanes adjacent to the airport have been elevated to create a safer and more efficient airport entrance. More than 30,000 drivers travel State Roads 85 and 123 each day between Fort Walton Beach and the suburbs of Niceville, Valparaiso and Crestview, and northern Okaloosa County. The roads, and their connection to Interstate 10, form an important economic development corridor that supports the tourism industry, Eglin AFB and the Northwest Florida Regional Airport. In addition, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) is currently designing a similar flyover ramp to better connect S.R. 123 northbound to S.R. 85 just south of Crestview. Work on that project is slated to begin in 2014. Work on the current S.R. 85/123 flyover project began in 2009.

Prince of Sagaing, as he was commonly known in his day, was selected as crown prince by his grandfather King Bodawpaya in 1808, and became king in 1819 after Bodawpaya's death. Bagyidaw moved the capital from Amarapura back to Ava in 1823. Bagyidaw's reign saw the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–1826), which marked the beginning of the decline of the Konbaung dynasty. Bagyidaw inherited the largest Burmese empire, second only to King Bayinnaung's, but also one that shared ill-defined borders with British India. In the years leading to the war, the king had been forced to suppress British supported rebellions in his grandfather's western acquisitions (Arakan, Manipur and Assam), but unable to stem cross border raids from British territories and protectorates.Owen 2005: 87–88 His ill-advised decision to allow the Burmese army to pursue the rebels along the vaguely defined borders led to the war. The longest and most expensive war in British Indian historyMyint-U 2006: 112–113 ended decisively in British favor, and the Burmese had to accept British terms without discussion.Phayre 1883: 237 Bagyidaw was forced to cede all of his grandfather's western acquisitions, and Tenasserim to the British, and pay a large indemnity of one million pounds sterling, leaving the country crippled for years. Devastated, Bagyidaw held out hope for some years that Tenasserim would be returned to him, and paid the balance of indemnity in 1832 at great sacrifice.Htin Aung 1967: 220–221 The British redrew the border with Manipur in 1830, but by 1833, it was clear the British would not return any of the former territories. The king became a recluse, and power devolved to his queen Nanmadaw Me Nu (born in Pha Lan Gon) and her brother.Steinberg et al 1987: 106 His brother Crown Prince Tharrawaddy raised a rebellion in February 1837, and Bagyidaw was forced to abdicate the throne in April 1837. King Tharrawaddy executed Queen Me Nu and her brother but placed his brother under house arrest. Bagyidaw died on 15 October 1846, at age 62. Early life The future king was born Maung Sein to Crown Prince Thado Minsaw, Prince of Shwedaung and his half-sister Min Kye, Princess of Taungdwin, on 23 July 1784. The infant prince was granted Sagaing as his fief by his grandfather King Bodawpaya, hence known as Prince of Sagaing. On 23 June 1793, the young prince, not yet 9, was made a general of the Northern and Southern Corps of Royal Cavalry. On 9 February 1803, the 18-year-old prince married 14-year-old Princess Hsinbyume, a granddaughter of Bodawpaya. The young prince was fond of shews, theater, elephant catching and boat racing. Crown Prince His father Crown Prince Thado Minsaw died on 9 April 1808. Nine days later, the young prince at 23 was suddenly elevated to the position of Crown Prince by his grandfather King Bodawpaya. The prince was also allowed to inherit his father's fiefs of Dabayin and Shwedaung. The Crown Prince was Master-General of the Ordnance in the Burmese-Siamese War of 1808, which ended in a stalemate. His elevation to crown prince also brought his royal servants, including Maung Yit (later Gen. Maha Bandula) of Dabayin and Maung Sa (later Lord of Myawaddy) of Sagaing to prominence. Myawaddy became his longtime adviser and personal secretary (atwinwn) until his abdication in 1837. He promoted Maung Yit to governor of Ahlon-Monywa. In 1812, his first queen Princess Hsinbyume died of childbirth in Mingun near Ava. The crown prince built a beautiful white stupa in memory of his first wife named Myatheindan Pagoda at Mingun.Sladen 1868 He took on five more queens as crown prince (of the eventual number of 23 queens). His third and later chief queen Nanmadaw Me Nu built the Maha Aungmye Bonzan Monastery in 1818, more commonly known as Me Nu Ok Kyaung (Me Nu's Brick Monastery), unusual in that Burmese monasteries traditionally are wooden structures.Cooler Chapter 4 During his stay as crown prince, his grandfather Bodawpaya renewed his expansionism in the west. In February 1814, a Burmese expeditionary force invaded Manipur, placing Marjit Singh, who grew up in Ava, as vassal king. In 1816, the Ahom governor of Guwahati in Assam, Badan Chandra Borphukan visited the court of Bodawpaya to seek help in order to defeat his political rival Purnananda Burhagohain, the Prime Minister of Ahom Kingdom in Assam. A strong force of 16,000 under the command of Gen. Maha Minhla Minkhaung was sent with Badan Chandra Borphukan. The Burmese force entered Assam in January, 1817 and defeated the Assamese force in the battle of Ghiladhari. Meanwhile, Purnananda Burhagohain died and Ruchinath Burhagohain, the son of Purnananda Burahgohain fled to Guwahati. The reigning Ahom king Chandrakanta Singha came in terms with Badan Chandra Borphukan and his Burmese allies. He appointed Badan Chandra Borphukan as Mantri Phukan (Prime Minister). An Ahom princess Hemo Aideo was given for marriage to Burmese King Bodawpaya along with many gifts to strengthen the ties with the Burmese monarch. The Burmese force returned to Burma soon after. A year later, Badan Chandra Borphukan was assassinated and the Ahom king Chandrakanta Singha was deposed by rival political faction led by Ruchinath Burhagohain, the son of Purnananda Burhagohain . Chandrakanta Singha and the friends of Badan Chandra Borphukan appeal for help to Bodawpaya. In February 1819, the Burmese forces invaded Assam for second time and reinstalled Chandrakanta Singha on the throne of Assam.E. A. Gait 1926 A History of Assam: 225–227Dr. S.K. Bhuyan 1968 Tungkhungia Buranji or A History of Assam(1681–1826) : 197–203 Reign =Troubles on the western front= Bodawpaya died on 5 June 1819, and Bagyidaw ascended to the throne without opposition. On 7 June 1819, he was crowned at Amarapura with the reign name of Sri Pawara Suriya Dharmaraja Maharajadhiraja. It was later expanded to Siri Tribhawanaditya Dhipati Pawara Pandita Mahadhammarajadhiraja.Yi Yi 1965: 53 Bagyidaw inherited the second largest Burmese empire but also one that shared a long vaguely defined borders with British India. The British, disturbed by the Burmese control of Manipur and Assam which threatened their own influence on the eastern borders of British India, supported rebellions in the region. The first to test Bagyidaw's rule was the Raja of Manipur, who was put on the Manipuri throne only six years earlier by the Burmese. Raja Marjit Singh failed to attend Bagyidaw's coronation ceremony, or send an embassy bearing tributes, as all vassal kings had an obligation to do. In October 1819, Bagyidaw sent an expeditionary force of 25000 soldiers and 3000 cavalry led by his favorite general Maha Bandula to reclaim Manipur.Aung Than Tun 2003 Bandula reconquered Manipur but the raja escaped to neighboring Cachar, which was ruled by his brother Chourjit Singh.Phayre 1883: 233–234 The Singh brothers continued to raid Manipur using their bases from Cachar and Jaintia, which had been declared as British protectorates. The instabilities spread to Assam in 1821, when the Ahom king of Assam, Chandrakanta Singha tried to shake off Burmese influence. He hired mercenaries from Bengal and began to strengthen the army. He also began to construct fortification to prevent further Burmese invasion.Dr. S. K. Bhuyan 1968 Tungkhungia Buranji or A History of Assam (1681–1826) : 204–205 Bagyidaw again turned to Bandula. It took Bandula's 20,000-strong army about a year a half, until July 1822, to finish off the Assamese army. Bagyidaw now scrapped the six- century-old Assamese monarchy and made Assam a province under a military governor-general. This differs with the Assamese versions of history where it is written that Bagyidaw installed Jogeswar Singha, a brother of Hemo Aideo, the Ahom princess who was married to Bodawpaya as the new Ahom king of Assam and a military governor-general was appointed to look after the administration.Dr. S. K. Bhuyan 1968 Tungkhungia Buranji or A History of Assam (1681–1826): 206–207E. A. Gait 1926 A History of Assam: 228–230 The defeated Assamese king fled to British territory of Bengal. The British ignored Burmese demands to surrender the fugitive king, and instead sent reinforcement units to frontier forts.Shakespear 1914: 62–63 Despite their success in the open battlefield, the Burmese continued to have trouble with cross border raids by rebels from British protectorates of Cachar and Jaintia into Manipur and Assam, and those from British Bengal into Arakan. At Bagyidaw's court, the war party which included Gen. Bandula, Queen Me Nu and her brother, the lord of Salin, made the case to Bagyidaw that a decisive victory could allow Ava to consolidate its gains in its new western empire in Arakan, Manipur, Assam, Cachar and Jaintia, as well as take over eastern Bengal.Myint-U 2001: 18–19 In January 1824, Bandula allowed one of his top lieutenants, Maha Uzana, into Cachar and Jaintia to chase away the rebels. The British sent in their own force to meet the Burmese in Cachar, resulting in the first clashes between the two. The war formally broke out on 5 March 1824, following border clashes in Arakan. =War= In the beginning of the war, battle hardened Burmese forces, who were more familiar with the terrain which represented \\"a formidable obstacle to the march of a European force\\", were able to push back better armed British forces made up of European and Indian soldiers.Phayre 1883: 236–237 By May, Uzana's forces had overrun Cachar and Jaintia, and Lord of Myawaddy's forces had defeated the British inside Bengal, causing a great panic in Calcutta. Instead of fighting in harsh terrain, the British took the fight to the Burmese mainland. On 11 May, a British naval force of over 10,000 men, led by Archibald Campbell entered the port city of Yangon, taking the Burmese by surprise. Bagyidaw ordered Bandula and most of the troops back home to meet the enemy at Yangon. In December 1824, Bandula's 30,000 strong force tried to retake Yangon but was soundly defeated by the much better armed British forces. The British immediately went on an offensive on all fronts. By April 1825, the British had driven out the Burmese forces from Arakan, Assam, Manipur, Tenasserim, and the Irrawaddy delta where Gen. Bandula died in action. After Bandula's death, the Burmese fought on but their last-ditch effort to retake the delta was repulsed in November 1825. In February 1826, with the British army only 50 miles away from Ava, Bagyidaw agreed to British terms. As per the Treaty of Yandabo, the British demanded and the Burmese agreed to: # Cede to the British Assam, Manipur, Arakan, and Tenasserim coast south of Salween river, # Cease all interference in Cachar and Jaintia, # Pay an indemnity of one million pounds sterling in four installments, # Allow for an exchange of diplomatic representatives between Ava and Calcutta, # Sign a commercial treaty in due course. =After the war= Bagyidaw's tomb in Amarapura. The treaty imposed highly severe financial burden to the Burmese kingdom, and effectively left it crippled. The British terms in the negotiations were strongly influenced by the heavy cost in lives and money which the war had entailed. Some 40,000 British and Indians troops had been involved of whom 15,000 had been killed. The cost to the British India's finances had been almost ruinous, amounting to approximately 13 million pounds sterling. The cost of war contributed to a severe economic crisis in India, which by 1833 had bankrupted the Bengal agency houses and cost the British East India Company its remaining privileges, including the monopoly of trade to China.Webster 1998:142–145 For the Burmese, the treaty was a total humiliation and a long lasting financial burden. A whole generation of men had been wiped out in battlefield. The world the Burmese knew of conquest and martial pride, built on the back of impressive military success of prior 75 years, had come crashing down. An uninvited British Resident in Ava was a daily reminder of humiliation of defeat. The burden of indemnity would leave the royal treasury bankrupt for years. The indemnity of one million pounds sterling would have been considered a colossal sum even in Europe of that time, and it became frightening when translated to Burmese kyat equivalent of 10 million. The cost of living of the average villager in Upper Burma in 1826 was one kyat per month.Htin Aung 1967: 214–215 Bagyidaw could not come to terms with the loss of the territories, and the British used Tenasserim as bait for the Burmese to pay the installments of indemnity. In 1830, the British agreed to redraw the Manipuri border with Burma, giving back Kabaw Valley to the Burmese. Bagyidaw delivered the balance of the indemnity at great sacrifice in November 1832. But by 1833, it was clear that the British had no intention of returning any of the territories. The king, who used to love theater and boat racing, grew increasingly reclusive, afflicted by bouts of depression. The palace power devolved to his chief queen Me Nu and her brother. In February 1837, Bagyidaw's crown prince and brother Tharrawaddy rebelled, and two months later in April, Bagyidaw was forced to abdicate. Tharrawaddy executed Me Nu and her brother, and kept his brother under house arrest. Bagyidaw died on 15 October 1846, at age 62. The former king had 23 queens, five sons and five daughters.

Biography Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Rex Cherryman attended Colgate University, (Hamilton, New York) in 1915–1916. He transferred to the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) in 1916. There he met fellow student Esther Louise Lamb. Esther and Rex were married February 9, 1918. They had one son, Rexford Raymond Cherryman, Jr., born October 10, 1925. Rexford, Jr. married Beatrice Wishard in 1950. They had two daughters: Ann Elizabeth Cherryman (born 1951) and Constance Lamb Cherryman (born 1954). Cherryman began his film career appearing in the 1919 comedic film In For Thirty Days as Count Dronsky, opposite popular leading lady of the silent film era, May Allison. The following year, Cherryman was chosen by the notable screen diva Alla Nazimova to appear opposite her as Thorne, in her penned dramatic film Madame Peacock. Cherryman and Nazimova developed a friendship and at Nazimova's request, he was cast in the role Gaston Rieux in the 1921 film that would possibly become his most recalled performance - 1921's Metro Pictures Corporation film adaptation of the Alexandre Dumas, fils novel La Dame aux Camélias, retitled as Camille. The film was an enormous critical and public success, placing Cherryman directly in the public consciousness. The film also starred Rudolph Valentino, Nazimova, and Patsy Ruth Miller. Cherryman also appeared in the 1923 film Sunshine Trail in the role of Willis Duckworth. Cherryman's last film performance was a small role in the 1928 film Two Masters. In addition to films, Cherryman was frequently involved with Broadway and various summer stock productions including the Denham Theatre in Denver, and the Aladdin Theatre in San Francisco, where he first met Barbara Stanwyck. He made several notable appearances on the stage. Among them were the musical comedy Topsy and Eva which ran from 1924 through 1925, The Valley of Content in 1925, and the Willard Mack penned drama The Noose, which ran from 1926 through 1927. While performing in The Noose, Cherryman had an affair with fellow cast member Stanwyck. The Noose subsequently became one of the biggest hits of the season and helped launch Stanwyck's career. Cherryman's last stint on Broadway was a starring role in the 1927 dramatic production of The Trial of Mary Dugan opposite actor Robert Cummings at the National Theatre. In August 1928, while sailing to France to read for a play in Paris, Cherryman contracted septic poisoning and died in Le Havre, France at the age of 31. His body was returned to Hollywood. His cremated remains are at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, California. Esther's remains are in the same vault.

It can exist in either of two enantiomeric forms, (R)-aporphine and (S)-aporphine. Many different derivatives have been isolated from plants. For example, many water-lilies (Nymphaea species) produce aporphine alkaloids such as nymphaeine, nymphaline, nupharine, α- and β-nupharidine. In vitro tests of some aporphine derivatives isolated from Cassytha filiformis, namely actinodaphnine, cassythine, and dicentrine, showed antiparasitic activity against Trypanosoma brucei. Investigation of possible mechanisms revealed that the compounds bind to DNA and act as intercalating agents, besides inhibiting topoisomerase activity. (R)-Aporphine is a dopamine receptor D1 antagonist with a Ki of 717 nM and a dopamine receptor D2 antagonist with a Ki of 527 nM. Aporphine and its related alkaloids bulbocapnine, boldine, glaucine, and corytuberine are antipsychotic, exert naloxone-reversible antinociceptive activity, and with the exception of corytuberine are anticonvulsant. Some derivatives of aporphine such as (S)-(+)-N-propylnorapomorphine have potential as low side effect profile antipsychotics.

Bandula was a key figure in the Konbaung dynasty's policy of expansionism in Manipur and Assam that ultimately resulted in the war and the beginning of the downfall of the dynasty. Nonetheless, the general, who died in action, is celebrated as a national hero by the Burmese for his resistance to the British. Today, some of the most prominent places in the country are named after him. Early life Maha Bandula was born Maung Yit ( ) on 6 November 1782 (Wednesday, 2nd waxing of Tazaungmon 1144 ME) in Dabayin, the firstborn son of a minor gentry family of Pauk Taw () and his wife, Nyein (, as in \\"calm\\"; not the more common as in \\"finality/completed\\").Myint-U 2006: 112 He had three siblings: brother Aye (), sister Dok (), and brother Myat Ne (). As customary with Burmese boys of the era, Yit from age of 6 received education at the local Buddhist monastery. He had to quit his studies before he turned 13 after his father died of illness. He had to take on early responsibilities in his youth after the death of his father. He worked the sesame fields with his mother and looked after his younger siblings. He got married a few years later to Shin Min Bu (). They had a son named Kyan Gyi ().Thein Maung 1966: 211 Service Later in his youth, Yit moved to Amarapura, then the kingdom's capital, to serve as the lowest grade retainer in the royal service of Crown Prince Thado Minsaw, who had his hometown Dababyin in fief.Aung Than Tun, NLM Stockily built and loud—based on his body armor, his height is estimated to be about 173 cm or 5′ 8″Thein Maung 1966: 246—Yit proved a quick study in martial arts, horseback riding and war elephant riding, and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming one of the crown prince's personal bodyguards in 1806. It was here as a royal bodyguard that Yit became exposed to military arts, receiving a further education in military strategy and tactics.Thein Maung 1966: 212 However Yit's rising career ran into a stall when Thado Minsaw died in April 1808. While he continued to be part of the Palace Guards, Yit was no longer in the inner circle of the new crown prince, the Prince of Sagaing. Yit dutifully served for the next four years in the background but still was not noticed. Deeply frustrated, Yit made a bold move to be noticed one day in late 1812, (soon after the second son of the crown prince was born on 27 October 1812): he punched a fellow palace guardsman Nanda Bala for no apparent reason. Duly arrested and brought before the crown prince, Yit explained that he just wanted to be called \\"Nga Yit\\" by the crown prince just once, and that he would gladly go to prison for his behavior. Impressed by Yit's bold behavior, the crown prince pardoned Yit and made him a messenger in his Privy Council (). Yit did not disappoint. In about six months, in June 1813 (Nayon 1175 ME), he was appointed governor of his hometown Dabayin with the title of Ne Myo Thura Yegaung ().Thein Maung 1966: 213-214 In the next decade, Yit would participate in the expansionist wars of King Bodawpaya and his successor King Bagyidaw. =Manipur (1814)= Yit's first battlefield experience came in Manipur. On 15 February 1814 (11th waning of Tabodwe 1175 ME), a 20,000-strong Burmese army left their forward bases along the Chindwin to invade Manipur in order to place their nominee on the Manipuri throne. Yit served under the command of co-commander-in-chief, Ne Myo Yazathu, and commanded three regiments (3000 men). The Burmese forces easily overran Manipuri defenses; Yit's regiments participated in the capture of the Manipuri capital. Yit was noticed for his leadership skills.Thein Maung 1966: 215-217 =Assam (1816–1819)= Bodawpaya's next target was Assam, another kingdom to the west but much larger one than Manipur. In 1816, the Assamese governor of Guwahati, Badan Chandra Borphukan sought help from the Burmese king in order to oust his political rival Purnananda Burhagohain, the Prime Minister. Bodawpaya agreed, and in December 1816, sent a 16,000-strong force led by Gen. Maha Minhla Minkhaung to Assam. Yit was a junior commander. The Burmese forces entered Assam in January 1817 and defeated the Assamese army at the battle of Ghiladhari. A fresh Assamese force was raised to defend the capital. The new Assamese army made a stand at Kathalbari near the Assamese capital Jorhat but was promptly defeated. King Chandrakanta Singha now agreed to become a tributary of Burma, and gave many presents and Ahom princess Hemo Aideo in marriage to the Burmese king.Gait 1926: 225–227 A year later, the pro-Burmese prime minister Badan Chandra Borphukan was assassinated, and the Ahom king Chandrakanta Singha was deposed by rival political faction led by Ruchinath Burhagohain. Chandrakanta Singha sought help from Bodawpaya. Yit was again called on to serve in November 1818 and in February 1819, the Burmese forces invaded Assam and reinstalled Chandrakanta Singha on the throne of Assam. In both Assamese campaigns, Yit was a regimental commander, two ranks below the overall commander-in-chief. Though a junior commander, Yit proved his worth on the battlefield, and his input was valued by the senior commanders. After a successful campaign in Assam, he was promoted to governor of Ahlon-Monywa in June 1819 (Nayon 1181 ME) by his lord the Prince of Sagaing who had just ascended to the Burmese throne as King Bagyidaw. On 3 November 1819 (2nd waning of Tazaungmon 1181), Yit was given the title of Maha Bandula () by the king. It is a title by which he would be remembered.Thein Maung 1966: 217–219 =Manipur (1819)= Maha Bandula's first major military action as a senior commander came soon after in Manipur. The small kingdom in the west was a rebellion-prone protectorate between 1758 and 1782, and had been retaken by Bodawpaya since 1814.Myint-U 2001: 15–16 When the raja of Manipur, Marjit Singh, who was placed on the throne by the Burmese only five years earlier, did not attend the new king's coronation ceremony or send an embassy bearing tribute, as all vassal kings had an obligation to do, Bagyidaw sent an expeditionary force to reclaim Manipur.Phayre 1883: 233–234 In December 1819, the Burmese forces invaded Manipur, under the overall command of Thado Minye Kyawhtin, the king's brother. Maha Bandula was one of two deputy commander-in- chiefs (Sitke). He commanded an infantry force of 5000 men and 500 cavalry, followed by Gen. Ne Myo Thura Minhla Nawrahta's 20,000 infantrymen and 2500 cavalry. The Manipuris made their stand near their capital. The fort, surrounded by high hills on two sides and heavily fortified by stout timber gates on the remaining side, was said to be nearly impregnable. Bandula sent in commandos who scaled the hills at night and broke open the stout gates, allowing the Burmese to take the fort and the capital. Raja Marjit Singh fled to the neighboring state of Cachar, which was ruled by his brother Chourjit Singh. The daring operation made him famous. After the conquest, the Burmese left a garrison in Manipur, backed by a long supply line up the Chindwin river. =Assam (1821–1822)= The Ahom King of Assam, Chandrakanta Singha tried to free himself from Burmese influence. He collected mercenaries from Bengal and started to strengthen his army and constructed fortifications to prevent further invasion of Burmese.Bhuyan 1968: 204–205 King Bagyidaw again turned to Bandula to reclaim Assam. In February 1821, a Burmese army of 20,000 (including 10,000 Hkamti Shan and Kachin levies) crossed the snow-clad mountains to Assam from their northernmost forts along the Hukawng valley. After nearly a year and a half of hard fought battles in some of the most difficult terrains in the world, the Burmese forces finally defeated Chandra Kanta Singha and the Assamese army in July 1822. Bagyidaw installed Jogeshwar Singha, a brother of Hemo Aideo, the Ahom princess who was married to Bodawpaya as the new Ahom king of Assam and a military governor-general was appointed to look after the administration. The defeated Assamese king Chandrakanta Singha fled to British territory of Bengal. The British ignored Bandula's demands to surrender the fugitive king, and instead sent reinforcement units to frontier forts.Shakespear 1914: 62–63 Maha Bandula left a military garrison of 2000 men commanded by Gen. Maha Thilawa, and returned to Ava. =First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–1826)= By 1822, the conquests of Manipur and Assam had brought a long border between British India and the kingdom of Ava. The British, based in Calcutta, had their own designs on the region, and actively supported rebellions in Manipur, Assam and Arakan. Calcutta unilaterally declared Cachar and Jaintia British protectorates, and sent in troops.Myint-U 2001: 18–19 Cross border raids into these newly acquired territories from British territories and spheres of influence vexed the Burmese. Convinced that war was inevitable, Bandula became a main proponent of offensive policy against the British. Bandula was part of the war party at Bagyidaw's court, which also included Queen Me Nu and her brother, the lord of Salin. Bandula believed that a decisive victory could allow Ava to consolidate its gains in its new western empire in Arakan, Manipur, Assam, Cachar and Jaintia, as well as take over eastern Bengal. In January 1824, Bandula sent in one of his top lieutenants Thado Thiri Maha Uzana into Cachar and Jaintia to chase away the rebels. The British sent in their own force to meet the Burmese in Cachar, resulting in the first clashes between the two. The war formally broke out on 5 March 1824, following border clashes in Arakan. Western theater As the commander-in-chief of the Burmese army, Maha Bandula was supported by twelve of the country's best battalions, including one under his personal command, totaling ten thousand men and five hundred horses. His general staff included some of the country's most decorated soldiers, men like the lord of Salay and the governors of Danyawaddy, Wuntho and Taungoo. Bandula's plan was to attack the British on two fronts: Chittagong from Arakan in the southeast, and Sylhet from Cachar and Jaintia in the north. Bandula personally commanded the Arakan theater while Uzana commanded the Cachar and Jaintia theaters. Early in the war, battle hardened Burmese forces were able to push back the British forces because the Burmese, who had been fighting in the jungles of Manipur and Assam for nearly a decade, were more familiar with the terrain which represented \\"a formidable obstacle to the march of a European force\\".Phayre 1883: 236–237 Uzana had already defeated the British units in Cachar and Jaintia in January 1824. In May, Burmese forces led by Lord Myawaddy defeated units of British India Army in the Battle of Ramu, inside British territory, causing a great panic in Calcutta. But Bandula, not wanting to overstretch, stopped Myawaddy from proceeding to Chittagong. Had Bandula marched on to Chittagong, which unbeknown to him was lightly held, he could have taken it and the way to Calcutta would have been open. Battle of Yangon (May–December 1824) Kyimyindaing Instead of fighting in hard terrain, the British took the fight to the Burmese mainland. On 11 May 1824, a British naval force of over 10,000 men (5000 British soldiers and over 5000 Indian sepoys) entered the harbor of Yangon, taking the Burmese by surprise. The Burmese pursuing a scotched earth policy, left an empty city, and instead chose to fortify positions along an east-west 10-mile arc outside the city. The British forces led by General Archibald Campbell took position inside a fortified Shwedagon Pagoda compound. The British launched attacks on Burmese lines, and by July 1824, had successfully pushed the Burmese towards Kamayut, five miles from Shwedagon. Burmese efforts to retake Shwedagon in September failed.Myint-U 2006: 114-117 King Bagyidaw ordered a near complete withdrawal from the western front—Bandula from Arakan and Bengal, and Uzana from Assam, Cachar and Jaintia—and meet the enemy in Yangon. In August, in the midst of monsoon season, Bandula and his army crossed the Arakan Yoma.Perrett 2007: 176–177 Even in good weather, moving tens of thousands of men over the high Arakan hills or high Assamese ranges, heavily forested and with only narrow footpaths, open to attack by tigers and leopards, would be difficult. To do this at the height of the drenching monsoon season was no easy task. Yet Bandula (from Arakan) and Uzana (from Assam) in a testament to their generalship and logistical skill, managed to do just that. The king granted both Bandula and Uzana the title Agga Maha Thenapati (), the highest possible military rank. Bandula was also made the governor of Sittaung. By November, Bandula commanded a force of 30,000 massed outside Yangon. Bandula believed that he could take on a well-armed British force of 10,000 head-on. Although the Burmese were numerically superior, only 15,000 of the 30,000 had muskets. The Burmese cannons fired only balls whereas the British cannons fired exploding shells. Unbeknown to him, the British had just received the first shipment of the newest weapon in war that the Burmese had never seen–Congreve rockets. On 30 November, in what turned out be the biggest mistake of his career, Bandula ordered a frontal attack on British positions. The British with far superior weaponry, withstood several Burmese gallant charges at the Shwedagon fort, cutting down men by thousands. By 7 December, the British troops, supported by rocket fire, had begun to gain the upper hand. On 15 December, the Burmese were driven out of their last remaining stronghold at Kokine.Myint-U 2006: 118-122 In the end, only 7000 of the 30,000 Burmese soldiers returned. Battle of Danubyu (March–April 1825) Maha Bandula inspects a lookout tree at Danubyu. Bandula fell back to his rear base at Danubyu, a small town not far from Yangon, in the Irrawaddy delta. Having lost experienced men in Yangon, the Burmese forces now numbered about 10,000, of mixed quality, including some of the king's best soldiers but also many untrained and barely armed conscripts. The stockade itself stretched a mile along the riverbank, and was made up of solid teak beams no less than 15 feet high. In March 1825, a four thousand strong British force supported by a flotilla of gun boats attacked Danubyu. The first British attack failed, and Bandula attempted a counter charge, with foot soldiers, cavalry and 17 fighting elephants. But the elephants were stopped by rocket fire and the cavalry found it impossible to move against the sustained British artillery fire. On 1 April, the British launched a major attack, pounding down on the town with their heavy guns and raining their rockets on every part of the Burmese line. Bandula was killed by a mortar shell. Bandula had walked around the fort to boost the morale of his men, in his full insignia under a glittering golden umbrella, discarding the warnings of his generals that he would prove an easy target for the enemy's guns. Legacy Maha Bandula's son, Maung Gyi, who served the Konbaung army, but later defected to the British. Maha Bandula looms large in Burmese history for his courage to take on the British. Due in large measure to Bandula's leadership, the First Anglo- Burmese War was the only one of the three Anglo-Burmese wars in which the Burmese were able to put up a fight. The Burmese remember Bandula's last words in this way: :We may lose the battle. This is our destiny. We fight our best and we pay our lives. However, I cannot suffer indignity and disgrace for losing the battle for the lack of courage and fighting prowess. Let them realize that the Burmese lost the battle because of the loss of their Supreme Commander. This will prove to be an everlasting example of the Burmese fighting spirit and enhance the honor and glory of our nation and the people amongst the neighboring states. Ironically, this very courage to take on the enemy head on and use the daring tactics that led to the improbable victories in Manipur and Assam would prove to be his undoing against the much better armed and world conquering British, who had defeated Napoleon's armies only a decade earlier. For all of his fame, Bandula failed to change tactics in face of far superior British weaponry. He failed to imagine the use of guerrilla tactics or any innovative strategy. Had he pursued guerrilla style tactics, the ultimate outcome of the war might not still have changed but the terms might have been less severe. =Popularity and fame= Bandula remains extremely popular in Burmese imagination, and is often the only general ranked alongside famous Burmese kings. His popularity is perhaps not just due to his skills as a military commander. After all, Bandula's victories came with able, experienced lieutenants like Gen. Ne Myo Thura Min Hla Nawrahta in Manipur, Gen. Myawaddy Mingyi U Sa in Arakan and Gen. Maha Thilawa in Assam. Besides, the country has known more successful generals like Gen. Maha Thiha Thura who defeated the Qing dynasty's invasions in 1766, 1767 and 1769, Gen. Maha Nawrahta and Gen. Ne Myo Thihapate, who dismembered Siam in 1767, or King Bayinnaung, the soldier king, who captured much of western mainland South East Asia in the 16th century. Then again, they never fought against the British, the world superpower of the day. Rather, Bandula's continued popularity is because of his courage to fight on against an overwhelmingly superior enemy. Perhaps, it is also because the Burmese view Bandula as the proxy for the last glory days of the Third Burmese Empire. The Burmese remember that Bandula's death was followed by a series of one ignominious setback after another that eventually led to the loss of sovereignty in 1885. It is also possible that he is well remembered as there are a number of British accounts who mentioned Bandula admiringly despite his failures. In particular, the British have praised Danubyu's defenses and had expected a long taxing siege. Indeed, some would say the ignominious setbacks continue up to this day. For whatever reason, Maha Bandula remains the most famous general in Burmese history. =Commemorations= Maha Bandula Bridge in Downtown Yangon Team Bandula is one of five student teams into which all students in every Burmese primary and secondary school are organized.

Previously he was head coach at Minnesota for over seven seasons (1999–2006), reaching postseason play five times. Before coaching the Gophers, he was the head coach at Gonzaga for two seasons, leading the Zags on an improbable run to the Elite Eight during his last season. Early years Monson is the son of college basketball coach Don Monson, and spent most of his early years in eastern Washington, where his father was a successful high school head coach in Cheney and Pasco for 18 seasons. At age 14, the family moved from Pasco to East Lansing, Michigan, where Don was an assistant coach for Jud Heathcote at Michigan State for two seasons. They moved to Moscow, Idaho, at the start of his junior year, when his father became the head coach of his alma mater, the University of Idaho, in August 1978. He graduated from Moscow High School in 1980 and played college football a few blocks away as a receiver for the Idaho Vandals, then under head coach Jerry Davitch. Monson suffered a knee injury that ended his playing career, and focused on coaching; he graduated from Idaho with a degree in secondary education (mathematics) in 1985. Coaching career After graduation, Monson was a high school coach in Oregon City, Oregon for a season, then became a collegiate graduate assistant under Gene Bartow at UAB in 1986, where he earned a master's degree in education. =Gonzaga= Monson began at GU as an assistant coach in 1988 before being elevated to associate head coach under head coach Dan Fitzgerald in 1994; in all, Monson spent eleven years helping build the Gonzaga program. As an assistant, Monson was a key figure in the Bulldogs turnaround during the 1990s. Gonzaga had a record of over ten seasons and he was responsible for recruiting many of the key players in Gonzaga's NCAA Sweet 16 appearances from 1998–2001. From the time Monson was named associate head coach in 1995, Gonzaga averaged 22 wins per season and reached postseason play every year but one. For all of this, Monson was elevated to head coach of the Zags in 1997. His first year as head coach at Gonzaga (1997–98) resulted in a 24–10 mark, as the Bulldogs won the West Coast Conference championship and advanced to the second round of the NIT. On their way to setting a school-record with its 24 wins, Monson was named the WCC Coach of the Year and National Rookie Coach of the Year by Basketball Times. The 1999 team brought Gonzaga basketball to national prominence with an impressive run in the NCAA tournament. In the West regional, the tenth-seeded Zags defeated 7th-seed Minnesota and 2nd-seed Stanford in the Seattle sub-regional, and 6th-seed Florida in the Sweet Sixteen round in Phoenix. Gonzaga advanced to the regional final (Elite Eight), taking the region's top seed, and eventual national champion, Connecticut down to the last minute, losing by five points. While at the helm at Gonzaga, Monson had a sparkling record in his two seasons and won both regular season titles. =Minnesota= Monson became one of the more sought after coaching candidates in college basketball in the spring of 1999. After Gonzaga's improbable run to the Elite Eight, he signed a new contract in mid- April, then was offered the head coaching position at the University of Minnesota in late July, which he accepted. Mark Yudof, then president of the university, was hoping that Monson would be able to help the program move past the scandals of previous head coach Clem Haskins.Khoo, Michael. \\"Monson's Message: Go to Class.\\" Minnesota Public Radio, July 26, 1999. http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/199907/26_khoom_monson/index.shtml In the previous season, Gonzaga had defeated Minnesota in the first round of the NCAA tournament after several Gopher players were forced to sit out due to an academic fraud investigation. Mark Few, Monson's top assistant, succeeded him at Gonzaga. Monson also had ties to Minnesota already, as his father Don was born in rural Menagha. In April 2002, Monson was courted by the University of Washington in Seattle to coach the Huskies and return to his home state of Washington. Monson initially accepted the offer presented by Huskies AD Barbara Hedges to succeed Bob Bender. The Minnesota athletic department, under Tom Moe, convinced Monson to change his mind and stay on with Minnesota. In the end, Monson decided to return to Minnesota because he didn't feel he had given enough time to the rebuilding effort at Minnesota and hadn't yet attained enough success with the team. Washington ultimately hired Lorenzo Romar. Dealing with the fallout from the academic scandals of the Haskins era, it was several years before Monson was able to recruit on equal footing with other Big Ten coaches. He led the Gophers to one NCAA Tournament and 4 NIT appearances in his 7 full seasons as Gophers coach. Nonetheless, he was widely praised for cleaning up the program's image. On November 30, 2006, Monson resigned as head coach of Minnesota after a 2–5 start and only achieving a single 20-win season in seven. Assistant coach Jim Molinari was appointed interim head coach before Tubby Smith was named the new head coach after the season. Monson compiled a 118–106 () record with the Gophers, giving him an overall career record of 170–123 () as a head coach. =Long Beach State= On April 6, 2007, Monson was named the head coach at Long Beach State. The 49ers improved in each of Monson's first several seasons, to the point that on February 24, 2011 Long Beach defeated Cal Poly 61–55 to clinch their first Big West regular season title since 2006–07 and the #1 seed in the Big West Tournament. The following season, Long Beach State won the conference's regular season (15-1) and tournament titles, and advanced to the 2012 NCAA Tournament. In all, Monson has led the 49ers to postseason play four times, won the Big West Conference men's basketball championship three times, and been named Big West Conference Coach of Year award three times. Under Monson, the 49ers routinely play one of the most difficult non-conference schedules in the nation. The team usually plays the likes of teams such as North Carolina, Duke, Louisville, and Texas. According to Coach Monson this is to prepare the team for Big West conference play and ultimately the NCAA tournament. Monson has also coached internationally; he was an assistant coach on the 1999 World University Games team and the 2004 USA U-20 team. In 2018, a poll of Big West Assistant Coaches named Long Beach State as the \\"Best Job in the Big West\\".

Lyrics and interpretation  \\"Rednecks\\" is sung from the perspective of a Southern \\"redneck\\". In it, he expresses his dismay at the way that the North looks down upon The South. In particular, the narrator describes his ire at watching a \\"smart-ass, New York Jew\\" mock Lester Maddox on a television program. (This is an allusion to Maddox's 1970 appearance on The Dick Cavett Show whose eponymous host is actually a gentile from Nebraska.) In response to his frustration at the television show, the narrator goes on to list, sarcastically, a litany of negative qualities that Southerners are reputed to have. He focuses especially on institutionalized racism, or, as the narrator puts it: \\"keeping the niggers down.\\" As the song ends, the narrator turns the knife on judgmental northerners, calling them out as hypocrites. There's still no one quite like Randy Newman , Philadelphia City Paper, September 27-October 4, 2001, Michael Pelusi He achieves this by singing that the \\"North has set the nigger free\\" and then sings African- Americans are only \\"free to be put in a cage,\\" and then lists a number of black ghettos in northern cities (e.g. Roxbury in Boston, East St. Louis and Harlem in New York City) The verse's final lyric is: \\"They [the Northerners] gatherin' 'em up, from miles around/Keeping the niggers down.\\" Writing in the Los Angeles Times, Randy Lewis said Newman had \\"peeled back the curtain on... bigots and hypocrites\\" with this song. He's back in the saddle, Los Angeles Times, August 3, 2008, Randy Lewis In 1995, Newman admitted that he was still nervous performing the song. A lengthy description of the Cavett broadcast is offered by author Steven Hart in his 2014 essay \\"He May Be a Fool But He's Our Fool: Lester Maddox, Randy Newman, and the American Culture Wars,\\" which appears in the collection Let the Devil Speak: Articles, Essays, and Incitements. Hart maintains that Cavett was, if anything, too diffident with Maddox, who played word games about the meaning of racism and segregation before \\"taking theatrical umbrage\\" and storming off the set only a few minutes before the end of the show. Newman felt differently, saying, \\"Now, I hate everything that he stands for, but they didn't give him a chance to be an idiot. And here he is, governor of a state—these people elected him in Georgia, however many million people voted for him—and I thought that if I were a Georgian, I would be angry.\\" Newman later said it was one of many songs he may have, \\"done differently, in terms of tempo or arrangement. I did \\"Rednecks\\" a little square, maybe.\\" Steve Earle recorded a cover of \\"Rednecks\\" in 2006 for the tribute album Sail Away: The Songs of Randy Newman. Newman's opinion Newman has called \\"Rednecks\\" one of his favorite compositions. He said he wrote the song after watching Maddox's appearance with Cavett and \\"seeing him be treated rudely... they had just elected him governor, in a state of 6 million or whatever, and if I were a Georgian, I would have been offended, irrespective of the fact that he was a bigot and a fool.\\" Newman said that having written \\"Rednecks\\" he felt he had to explain where he was coming from, which led him to write \\"Marie\\" and \\"Birmingham\\", two other songs that ended up on his Good Old Boys album.

Feeder school districts * Cicero Elementary School District 99 * Lyons School District 103 * Berwyn North School District 98 * South Berwyn School District 100 History In 1892, there were reports that the town of Cicero was beginning to work to consolidate a school district that would include the then current Morton Park and Hawthorne District with one consisting of the towns of Clyde and LaVergne, to create what was called a \\"High School Department\\". Cicero-Stickney Township High School (with \\"Clyde P.O.\\") was established as a township high school district in 1898 with 4 teachers and 44 students. By the 1903-1904 school year, it was one of the 33 township high school districts in Illinois, and had 10 teachers and 130 students, with 8 students graduating that year. The principal for the 1904-1905 school year was H. V. Church. Berwyn is in the district because it had not yet been created out of Cicero when the district was formed. A portion of Stickney is in the district because state law at the time required a township high school district to comprise parts of two or more townships. Lyons was annexed to the district by public petition in 1920. By then, the name \\"J. Sterling Morton High School\\" was already in use for the high school, though the legal name was \\"Cicero-Stickney Township High School\\". In 1922, High School District 201 issued building bonds for $250,000. =1930s= By 1931, Morton had reached its capacity of 3,000 students, and a bond issue was put before the electorate to raise funds for a new school to be built in neighboring Berwyn. The issue was defeated 7751–8035. In May 1932, the school district closed the school two weeks ahead of schedule because of financial troubles. The school also announced that the autumn opening of school would be pushed back two weeks to further save money. The closing also affected Morton Junior College, which was housed at the school. The 1932–33 school year saw teachers and students join in an unusual revolt against the board of education. In October 1932, the school's football coach was fired without warning, prompting 800 citizens to attend a board meeting to retain him. The coach was reputedly fired for being critical of the board for discounting tax warrants with which teachers had been paid over the past months in lieu of money. About one month later, students began a boycott of the cafeteria, charging that not only had prices gone up, but that workers had been fired to be replaced by more workers with ties to the school board. The board then hired private individuals to patrol the school. The publicity surrounding these actions prompted the accrediting agency for the school, the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, to begin an inquiry as to whether the school should remain accredited. This was immediately followed by the North Central Association's assertion that, despite teachers receiving no cash salary for almost a year, and being forced to sell the tax warrants they had been receiving for substantial discounts, the board had hired unnecessary custodial staff, cafeteria workers, and largely under-qualified teachers without consulting the superintendent. The situation reached a head when Harry V. Church, the school's superintendent, announced that he too was joining the student-faculty revolt, and would inform the state's attorney of what he knew, including the hiring of teachers sponsored by the board over his objections, a US$3.5 million debt run up by the board, and the specific names of employees that had been hired who were relatives of board members. Despite a direct threat of removal from the school board president, the superintendent demoted the head of the physical welfare department, who had been instrumental in firing the football coach who had drawn attention to the school problems. A group of thirteen civic groups, headed by the local Rotary Club, concluded their own investigation. The demands in regards for drawing up a budget were voted on by the board, but no action was taken. When the superintendent and an independent auditor asked to examine the financial information for the district, they were refused on the grounds that the financial officer \\"couldn't do much without two office employees, who are ill\\". One of the employees named was the daughter of the board president. On December 12, the secretary of the North Central Association read a letter at the public meeting of the board stating \\"The standards of the school are very shaky.\\". When a taxpayers' group asked for the board to request that the State's Attorney begin an inquiry, a board member responded that the \\"state's attorney hasn't time to bother about such small matters.\\" In January, the superintendent was dismissed after a taxpayers' group lobbied for his removal. This prompted the Berwyn Ministers' Association to call a meeting attended by 2,500 residents to demand an open hearing on the ousted superintendent. At that meeting, the secretary of the North Central Association spoke out in favor of the former superintendent, and stated that the board's inability to set a budget and to engage in politically motivated hiring practices would lower the accreditation rating of the school. Despite adopting a budget for the remainder of the school year, new charges against the board surfaced. The parent-teacher association began a petition to submit to the governor requesting the removal of the board, amongst allegations that similarly worded and appearing petitions were being circulated to gain praise for the board. On the evening of February 2, a burning cross was found on the athletic field. At a board meeting in March, a citizen identified himself as a member of the Ku Klux Klan, and informed the board that \\"As an organization we are watching developments ...\\" The interim superintendent recommended immediate austerity measures, punctuated by a reduction in staffing, including the elimination of 20 of the 40 office clerks, several custodial personnel, and the elimination of all teacher-clerks (permanent substitute teachers). The board was also forced to deal with being voted out of the Suburban League. As a result of the actions at Morton, the (pre-union) National Education Association's department of secondary school principals censured the board, and called for new laws that would prevent similar abuses in the future. Later in March, the board secretly selected a new superintendent and principal, despite a recommendation from the North Central Association that a list of educators form a search committee. By this time, results of inquiries into the finances of the district had been hampered by the disappearance of the district's financial officer. When it was determined that the controller had taken money from the school's petty cash, leaving an IOU, the board requested, and received, a warrant for his arrest. His successor also found that US$9,500 in tax warrants were missing, one of which was traced to a local grocer who had received it from the missing controller to pay a debt. The controller surrendered himself, and paid bail, claiming he had been suffering from a nervous breakdown brought on by the recent problems; he denied stealing from the school. The April school board election saw two new members elected to the board, with one of them becoming the new president. In the wake of the election, the North Central Association delivered a formal warning to the school, stating that while it would remain accredited, the warning was a formality required as a prelude to losing accreditation, should it be deemed necessary in a year's time. The new board followed through on a recommendation from the North Central Association, and took the recommendation of a committee of 33 educators to hire a professor of education from South Dakota to become the new permanent superintendent, L. M. Hrudka. By 1934, the district was back on a cash-paying basis. By 1936, the school population had reached 6,000. The firing of three maintenance workers in December 1936 at the school prompted a strike of the 40 unionized members of the custodial staff. The picket line blocked the delivery of coal to the school, forcing it to remain closed as there was only a limited stockpile available for heating. The board retaliated by firing thirty more maintenance workers, with the caveat they could reapply for their jobs within three days. A local painter who had helped maintain the furnaces in the absence of maintenance staff was beaten near the school. As the coal supplies dwindled, the state's attorney called for mediation, and the sides met on January 8. When talks were unsuccessful, school officials arranged for police to guard deliveries of coal to the school. Three of the drivers who had made the coal deliveries, a man and his two sons, were run off the road and beaten in retaliation. Municipal officials began to ask for greater effort to end the strike. One board member resigned a key position in his church after the pastor spoke out against school officials. The Illinois Department of Labor issued subpoenas for school officials to appear at a conference arranged to settle the strike. An agreement was ratified by both sides on January 24, with all but four strikers returning to work, and the original fired maintenance staff guaranteed a hearing with \\"good prospects of reinstatement\\". In 1938, L. M. Hrudka was dismissed as superintendent, despite a year remaining on his contract, following concerns raised by the North Central Association that he was not cooperating properly with the faculty. However, the secretary of the board, publicly declaring the firing as a \\"colossal piece of trickery\\", refused to notify the administrator of his dismissal, and claimed the vote was illegal since it occurred after the board had adjourned. The board claimed that Hrudka had been a factor in the North Central Association downgrading the school's rating. In March 1939, the Illinois state committee of the North Central Association, citing political interference and a lack of leadership, informed the school that it would be recommending that it lose accreditation, invalidating current and future student credits toward college admission. While preparing to defend itself against these charges, the board settled a lawsuit filed by fired superintendent Hrudka for the full amount of his remaining contract. An investigation by the North Central Association resulted in the school again being put on one year's notice to improve standards or risk losing accreditation. =1950s to 1960s= While the 1940s had been relatively quiet, 1952 saw the joint resignation of the superintendent and business manager over what was described as \\"personal quarreling\\". At the meeting where the resignations were accepted, a citizen denounced the board president, Edward Chodl. Chodl then \\"ran toward (him), but was restrained by other board members.\\" The pair were guaranteed to be paid their combined $23,740 contracts for the next year, with the outgoing superintendent given an additional $8,000 to rent his educational film library for ten years. In the autumn of 1969, a teacher's strike was called at the school for the first time in its history. One teacher was arrested for using his picket sign as a weapon against a school board member. In response, the West Suburban Teachers' Union, which represented eleven school districts, asked for all of its members to take an emergency personal day and join in protesting a back to work order issued by a judge, and what were termed as \\"union busting\\" tactics by the Morton school board. The strike lasted 22 days. In November, the striking teachers were charged individually with contempt of court. 64 teachers were found guilty and sentenced to ten days in prison and a $100 fine. In the end, the president of the union, a Morton East teacher, was fined $1,000 and sentenced to 20 days in jail for contempt. =1980s= Morton West and Morton East high schools went into the same school district in the 1985–1986 school year.\\"Welcome to Morton East's History.\\" J. Sterling Morton High School East. Retrieved on December 20, 2016. =2000s to present= Morton High School District 201 has drastically expanded learning opportunities. Morton continues to enhance the many activities that support students’ learning such as Tapestry, Credit Recovery Program, and the Freshmen Mentoring Program. Several support programs such as Coaching Centers, Student Intervention Teams, and the Technology Support Internship make the education process a seamless one. Morton High School District 201 released a new grading system in 2014, which ensures that all parties are held accountable for the academic success of students and allows teachers to hold students to the highest standards. District 201 actively engages parents and community members. The district actively supports the Parent Teacher Organization and Parent Teacher Association, which helps with several community events throughout the school year, including coordinating a series of annual anti-bullying events. Parent liaisons at all campuses get parents involved in school and community events and hold monthly principal meetings to receive community feedback. Throughout the year counselors host a series of college nights explaining the college application and financial aid process to parents. District 201 has worked to provide safe and well maintained schools to enhance learning for all students. In 2014, the main school entrances were remodeled to provide control of all individuals entering school grounds. Also in 2014, the Board of Education inaugurated the new Morton Stadium which includes a new field, concession stand, and an 8 lane track, among several facility upgrades. In 2014, District 201 upgraded the Morton West pool room lighting with energy efficient lights and updated the ceiling, windows and paint. The Morton West cafeteria was also renovated and expanded over the summer of 2014. In 2014 the old Morton East pool was finally renovated into an expanded classroom. In 2015, six chemistry labs in Morton East and West will be renovated. Renovations are expected for the culinary arts room as well. The 1:1 program was officially launched in 2014. In 2014 all incoming freshmen were given a Dell lap top device. District 201 will continue roll out the distribution and use of laptops for all incoming freshmen classes. In 2014 a new interactive white board was installed in all classrooms throughout the district to support the 1:1 program. District 201 continues to improve district-wide technology infrastructure with an increase to district wide bandwidth. This increase in bandwidth allows students to take advantage of the 1:1 program. In 2014 District 201 had its 5th consecutive balanced budget. On this same year, District 201 also received the Association of School Business Officials International's (ASBO) Certificate of Excellence in Financial Reporting Award for having met or exceeded the program's high standards for financial reporting and accountability. The district was recognized for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ending 2013. A Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) is a set of financial statements that provide a thorough and detailed presentation of a school district's financial condition and goes beyond the minimum information necessary for fair presentation in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

The lift, see here from the north side, was powered by a water wheel in the Wasi River, who's outlet can be seen on the right below the lift. The \\"JR Booth\\" was the only engine to work the N&N;, an unusually large engine for a lumber railway. The Nosbonsing and Nipissing Railway (N&N;) was a portage railway constructed by Ottawa lumber baron John Rudolphus Booth. The line connected Lake Nipissing with Lake Nosbonsing to allow lumber to be portaged onto the Mattawa River, and from there to the Ottawa River. It allowed timber from a wide area across central Ontario to be sent to Booth's mill in Ottawa, at that time the largest sawmill in the world.\\"Track and Tower\\" brochure, Friends of Algonquin Park History The line was completed in August 1884 and initially operated as a private line. However, when the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway (N&PJ;) began construction of their north-south line in the same area, Booth officially chartered the N&N; in March 1886. The N&PJ; had already secured crossing rights, but had to renegotiate them with the newly chartered N&N.; The N&PJ;, the joint project of the Northern Railway of Canada and the Hamilton and North Western Railway,https://www.railwaypages.com/northern- railway-of-canada-group were not amused. Their negotiation position was to threaten to rip up the N&N; tracks. Booth responded by purchasing a diamond intersection and giving it to the Northern to install. However, the N&N; retained the crossing rights, which allowed them to hold up Northern traffic at their leisure. Traffic on the line was initially very busy, with the single locomotive hauling a train of 22 flatbed cars back and forth between the two ends. When it arrived at the western end with the empty train, it would drop the empty cars off on a siding, then switch to the mainline to pull eleven filled cars out onto the line, drawing another eleven into the loading station. Once these were loaded the train left for the eastern end while the empty cars are pulled into the station by hand. At the eastern end the logs were simply rolled down into Nosbonsing, the entire operation taking two men only two and a half minutes. Typically ten trips were made per day, with a total of 4,000 logs. The rate increased to 14 a day at one point, at which point the crews went on strike. This railway was abandoned in 1912 with the ending of major logging operations in the area. The charter of the N&N; was transferred to Booth's Egan Estates Railway, near Madawaska. In 1914, the original N&N; railbed was used as the basis for Booth Road. Route Nipissing is the lower of the two lakes, with a steep embankment on its eastern side that leads upward to a table of land. From there to Nosbonsing the land remains fairly flat. A long jack ladder was built at Nipissing to haul logs up the bank into a large loading station, a roofed but otherwise open building . The ladder was powered by a waterwheel in a large flume with water supplied from the adjacent Wasi River, which also drove a pump when needed for fire fighting or refilling the locomotive. Today the route has a number of names, starting as Wasi Falls Road at the west end, becoming Route 654 until it crosses Ontario Highway 11 where it becomes Lake Nosbonsing Road, and finally becoming Booth Road again just short of the eastern end at Lake Nosbonsing in the town of Astorville.

Now Mansonville is the business center and the seat of Municipalite du canton de Potton (government for the township).

Memphremagog Press, Newport, Vt., 1926 (First Edition):pp. 20 and 21 Like many Eastern Townships and New England villages, Mansonville grew up around a water-powered mill which exploited a head of water above a fall on the North Branch of the Missisquoi River. The mill ceased operating with electrification in the early 20th century, which allowed economies of scale and centralized manufacturing in larger centres. It operated as a feed and grain mill until 2004, when it was destroyed by fire. Overlooking the mill site is the mansion of the Manson family that founded the town. The mansion has since become a bed and breakfast. Mansonville, like many Eastern Townships communities, has long had a mixture of French and English- speaking residents and is home to over twenty nationalities and ethnic groups. Religious diversity is present, and in Mansonville, Roman Catholic, United (closed 2011) and Anglican churches are located a few yards apart. Mansonville was also the home of Russian Orthodox prelate Metropolitan Vitaly (Ustinov) for some five decades until his death in 2006.

Although the incident management team concept was originally developed for wildfire response, it has been expended into what is now known as \\"All-Hazards Incident Management Team”. An AHIMT can respond to a wide range of emergencies, including fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunami, riots, spilling of hazardous materials, and other natural or human- caused incidents.A Type 2 Incident Management Team assumes management of a fire emergency. In the United States, there are predominantly five types of incident management teams (IMTs). An incident such as a wildland fire is initially managed by local fire departments or fire agencies, but if the fire becomes complex additional resources are called in to address the emergency, and higher levels of management training and capability are required. IMTs are \\"typed\\" according to the size, scope and complexity of incidents they are capable of managing and are part of an incident command system. To manage the logistical, fiscal, planning, operational, safety and community issues related to the incident/emergency, an Incident Management Team will provide the command and management infrastructure that is required. Incident management starts as the smallest unit and escalates according to the size, scope and complexity of the emergency. The five types of IMTs are as follows: * Type 5: Local Village and Township Level – a \\"pool\\" of primarily fire officers from several neighboring departments trained to serve in Command and General Staff positions during the first 6–12 hours of an incident. * Type 4: City, County or Fire District Level – a designated team of fire, EMS, and possibly law enforcement officers from a larger and generally more populated area, typically within a single jurisdiction (city or county), activated when necessary to manage an incident during the first 6–12 hours and possibly transition to a Type 3 IMT. * Type 3: State or Metropolitan Area Level - comprising several entities within a state or DHS Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) region, activated to support incident management at incidents that extend beyond one operational period. Type 3 IMTs will respond throughout the state or large portions of the state, depending upon State- specific laws, policies, and regulations. * Type 2: National and State Level – a federally or state-certified team; has less training, staffing and experience than Type 1 IMTs, and is typically used on smaller scale national or state incidents. There are thirty-five Type 2 IMTs currently in existence, and operate through interagency cooperation of federal, state and local land and emergency management agencies. * Type 1: National and State Level – a federally or state-certified team; is the most robust IMT with the most training and experience. Sixteen Type 1 IMTs are now in existence, and operate through interagency cooperation of federal, state and local land and emergency management agencies. An incident management team consists of five subsystems as follows: * Incident command system (ICS) – an on-scene structure of management-level positions suitable for managing any incident; * Training – including needs identification, development, and delivery of training courses; * Qualifications and certification – the United States has national standards for qualifications and certification for ICS positions; * Publications management – the development, control, sourcing, and distribution of National Incident Management System (NIMS) publications provided by the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG); and * Supporting technology and systems – technology and materials used to support an emergency response, such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), orthophoto mapping, National Fire Danger Rating System, remote automatic weather stations, automatic lightning detection systems, infrared technology, and communications.

He served as the head football coach at Florida A&M; University (FAMU) for 25 years, from 1945 to 1969, compiling a record of 204–36–4. His won–loss record is among the best of any college football coach. Gaither was born in 1903 in Dayton, Tennessee. His father was a preacher, and as a youth Gaither expected to also become a preacher. He graduated from Knoxville College, where he played football as an end in 1927. Gaither's father died around that time, and Gaither became a high school football coach to help support his family. Gaither later completed a master's degree at Ohio State University in 1937. Coach Jake Gaither (standing, middle, white shirt with whistle) in the locker room with his Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU) football team: Tallahassee, Florida, 1953 Gaither went to work as an assistant to head coach William M. Bell at Florida A&M; College for Negroes (as it was called then) in 1937. The FAMC Rattlers had an undefeated (8–0) season that year, and won their first black college football national championship. The school won the national title again in 1942. Bell left to enter military service in 1943. After two years of problems in the football program, Gaither was hired as the head football coach for Florida A&M; College in 1945. One story is that the president of the college could not find anyone else to take the job. Gaither worked very hard to motivate his players. He would say, \\"I like my boys to be agile, mobile, and hostile.\\" It is reported that he would hide an onion in his handkerchief to work up tears in his pre-game pep talks. He built up an effective recruiting network, and by the 1960s did not even bother to recruit players from outside the state of Florida. Gaither was dedicated to his job. After retiring, he told his biographer, \\"I run into so many people who have no deep sense of morals—people who got a price tag on them, who'd sell their soul. I want to find the man who has no price tag on him. I'm not for sale.\\" Gaither instituted an annual coaching clinic at FAMU in the late 1950s. He recruited major college coaches, including Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant, Frank Broyles, Darrell Royal, Woody Hayes and Adolph Rupp, among others, to staff the clinics. Gaither introduced the Split-T formation in 1963, and it was soon adopted at other colleges. In 1969 Florida A&M; defeated the Spartans of the University of Tampa, 34–28, in the South's first football game between a white college and a historically black college. Gaither also coached basketball and track in his early years as football coach. He later became Director of Athletics and Chairman of the Department of Health, Physical Education and Recreation at FAMU. He continued to hold the last two positions after he retired as coach until his retirement from teaching in 1973. When Gaither retired from coaching in 1969, his Florida A&M; teams had a 204–36–4 record, for a .844 winning percentage. Thirty-six players from Gaither's teams were All-Americans, and 42 went on to play in the National Football League (NFL). Gaither was named Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference Coach of the Decade. He was named College Division Coach of the Year by the American Football Coaches Association in 1962, and was voted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1975. He also received the Amos Alonzo Stagg Award that year, and the Walter Camp Man of the Year award in 1974. The Jake Gaither Trophy has been awarded to the best Black collegiate football player each year since 1978. The Jake Gaither Gymnasium is located on the FAMU campus. Gaither died in Tallahassee, Florida in 1994. The Jake Gaither House where he lived is now a cultural center.

Haylofts were used to hide escaped slaves on the Underground Railroad. A hayloft is a space above a barn, stable or cow-shed, traditionally used for storage of hay or other fodder for the animals below. Haylofts were used mainly before the widespread use of very large hay bales, which allow simpler handling of bulk hay. The hayloft is filled with loose hay from the top of a wagon, thrown up through a large door, usually some or more above the ground, often in the gable end of the building. Some haylofts have slots or holes (sometimes with hatches), each above a hay-rack or manger in the animal housing below. The hay could easily be dropped through the holes to feed the animals. Another method of using a hayloft is to create small bundles of hay (1–4 cubic feet), then hoist them up using a block and tackle—in this case a hay elevator to the room. This allows for more efficiency when moving hay around. The difference between a hayloft and a mow is significant. A mow is exposed to the weather, only elevated on a small platform off the ground. This is often used for drying hay. A hayloft is used for more permanent storage of hay. It is sheltered from the weather and where a modern-day attic would be. A struggle in any type of keeping hay is that it must be totally dry. Otherwise, when piled up in a hayloft, it will start to compost. The insulation provided by the other hay ensures that thermophilic bacteria involved in the decomposition will be at their ideal temperature, thus turning the good hay into the dirt. That is also why farmers are so determined to keep hay off the ground since it would absorb moisture. Haylofts in old buildings are now often used for other storage or have been converted into habitable rooms. However, farms that use small square hay bales may still use the hayloft for storage of hay. Many farmers now use bales of hay so large they must be handled by machinery, and these are normally stored in more open buildings or outside. Others have forgone hay in favor of grain or silage.

It is part of the district Gwinnett County Public Schools. The superintendent of the district is J. Alvin Wilbanks and the school's principal is Nathan Ballantine. History North Gwinnett High School was established in 1958. It was built in a former cotton field between the communities of Suwanee and Sugar Hill for the purpose of consolidating the two communities' separate high schools, Suwanee High School and Sugar Hill High School. The land for the school was donated by the estate of Tom Robinson, for whom the NGHS football field is named.History of North Gwinnett High School, Gwinnett County Public Schools website, accessed August 26, 2011 In its early years, NGHS was a small school. In 1960, the school served grades 8 through 12 and there were 328 students enrolled. The eighth grade was eliminated after a new middle school was built during the 1973-1974 school year. By that year, NGHS had 606 students. The school grew dramatically in subsequent decades. Enrollment reached 1,000 for the first time in the 1988-1989 school year and has reached over 2,800. For the 2011-2012 school year, enrollment was 2,670.North Gwinnett High profile, Gwinnett County Public Schools website, accessed August 26, 2011 As of 2018-2019, enrollment is reported as 2,846 students. North Gwinnett High School figured in Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools (503 US 60 - Supreme Court 1992), a U.S. Supreme Court case that was decided in 1992. A female student at the school accused a teacher of sexual harassment and sued the school district for monetary damages for not stopping the harassment after she complained to school authorities. The federal district court ruled that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, under which she sued, did not allow for monetary damages. The appeals court affirmed that ruling, but the Supreme Court overturned that decision. The Supreme Court found that Title IX does allow for monetary damages, thus returning the student's case to lower courts.Franklin v.

Early life and legal career Kuper was born to a Lithuanian Jewish family. His siblings included his sister Mary (d. 1948), who in later life directed the Johannesburg Legal Aid Bureau. Kuper trained in law at the University of the Witwatersrand, receiving there his BA and LLB degrees. As a lawyer, he represented African clients in human-rights cases, and also represented one of the country's early non-segregated trade unions. He supported the establishment of South Africa's first legal aid charity. Wartime service Kuper served with the Eighth Army in Kenya, Egypt, and Italy, as an intelligence officer, from 1940 to 1946. After the war he organised the National War Memorial Health Foundation, which provided social and medical services for disadvantaged people from all backgrounds. Scholarly and political activities In 1947 Kuper went to the University of North Carolina, where he earned an M.A. in sociology. He was subsequently appointed Lecturer in Sociology at the University of Birmingham in England. At Birmingham, Kuper directed a research project intended to help the city of Coventry recover from the bombing it received during World War II. This project culminated in the publication of Living in Towns (1953). Kuper completed a doctorate in sociology at the University of Birmingham in 1952, and moved to Durban, South Africa, as Professor of Sociology at the University of Natal. Kuper was an active opponent of apartheid. Under his headship, the Sociology Department at the University of Natal was the only integrated academic department in South Africa. Kuper and his colleague Fatima Meer were subjected to surveillance by the apartheid government, and classes taught in the department were infiltrated by government spies, resulting in a chilling effect. During his time in Durban, Kuper co-founded the Liberal Party of South Africa, and became chairman of its Natal branch. On 6 December 1956, Kuper and Alan Paton spoke on behalf of the Liberal Party at a fundraising event in Durban in aid of the Treason Trial defendants. They and four other speakers were arrested and charged under a segregationist statute, the Natal Provincial Notice No. 78 of 1933, accused of \\"holding, or attending, or participating in ... a meeting of natives\\". Of the ensuing trial, Paton recalled: On 1 August 1957, all six defendants were acquitted on appeal. During the 1960s, Kuper moved to Los Angeles, California, United States, where he took up teaching and researching at UCLA and was appointed professor of sociology. His publications include The Pity of it All, Passive Resistance in South Africa, and The Prevention of Genocide. His book Genocide: Its Political Use in the Twentieth Century (1981) was particularly widely cited and continues to be studied more than thirty years later. Kuper was a founding member of the International Council of the Institute on the Holocaust and Genocide in Jerusalem. In the mid-1980s, he founded International Alert, with the support of Michael Young, Martin Ennals and others. Personal life In 1936, Kuper married anthropologist Hilda Beemer, with whom he had two daughters: the international human rights lawyer Dr Jenny Kuper and the painter and sculptor Mary Kuper.

Its design is accredited to Abu Es Haq es Saheli who was paid 200 kg (40,000 mithqals) of gold by Musa I of Mali, emperor of the Mali Empire. According to Ibn Khaldun, one of the best known sources for 14th century Mali, al-Sahili was given 12,000 mithkals of gold dust for his designing and building of the djinguereber in Timbuktu. But more reasoned analysis suggests that his role, if any, was quite limited. The architectural crafts in Granada had reached their zenith by the fourteenth century, and it is extremely unlikely that a cultured and wealthy poet would have had anything more than a dilettante's knowledge of the intricacies of contemporary architectural practice.The Meanings of Timbuktu, Bloom, Pg. 52. Except for a small part of the northern facade, which was reinforced in the 1960s in alhore (limestone blocks, also widely used in the rest of the town), and the minaret, also built in limestone and rendered with mud,Djingareyber Mosque Restoration the Djingareyber Mosque is made entirely of earth plus organic materials such as fibre, straw and wood. It has three inner courts, two minarets and twenty-five rows of pillars aligned in an east-west direction and prayer space for 2,000 people. Djinguereber is one of four madrassas composing the University of Timbuktu. It was inscribed on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1988, and in 1990 was considered to be in danger due to sand encroachment. A four- year project towards the restoration and rehabilitation of the Mosque began in June 2006, and is being conducted and financed by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture. On 26 February 2010, during Mawlid (festival to mark the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad), a stampede at the mosque killed around 26 people and injured at least 55 others- mostly women and children.; ; ; Wikinews  2012 terror attacks  On 1 July 2012, Islamic extremists of the Ansar Dine (Defenders of Faith) began destroying Timbuktu's cultural treasures shortly after UNESCO placed them on a list of endangered World Heritage sites. Declaring the ancient Muslim shrines \\"haram\\", or forbidden in Islam, Ansar Dine set about destroying seven of Timbuktu's sixteen mausolea of ancient Muslim saints, including two tombs at the Djingareyber mosque.Mali Islamists destroy tombs at ancient Timbuktu mosque  Radio Netherlands Worldwide Using \\"hoes, pick-axes and chisels, they hammered away at the two earthen tombs until they were completely destroyed\\". Damage to the mosque itself was, however, minimal.  Preservation  Desertification is defined by UNESCO as, “degradation in arid, semi-arid, dry sub-humid area resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities.” Between 1901 and 1996, temperature rose by 1.4 degrees Celsius in the area, which enhanced desert encroachment, as well as sand blown damages. Efforts to repair and raise the walls of the mosque have been ongoing, but there is still a one- meter difference between the roof height in 1952 and today. While drought may cause issues, too much rain has also shown to be detrimental to the mosque. Heavy rains in 1999, 2001, and 2003 caused the collapse of many traditionally built earthen buildings, as well as more recently built structures. As our delicately balanced climate fluctuates due to climate change, world heritage sites such as the Djingareyber mosque have suffered.Colette, Augustin, and Kishore Rao. Case Studies on Climate Change and World Heritage. UNESCO World Heritage Centre, 2009, pp. 74–75, Case Studies on Climate Change and World Heritage. The State Party was requested at the last World Heritage Committee to provide all technical documents on the proposed new 4-year restoration project for the Djingareyber Mosque, being carried out by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture. However, no documents had been received before the mission and in its report the State Party gave few details of this major project. The mission noted that the first phase of restoration work was a pilot project undertaken from November 2006 to July 2007. This work had included drainage and paving around the mosque, re-rendering walls in bad condition and in one zone of the roof, replacing around 50% of the beams, above which was a heavy build-up of mud plaster. The masons in charge of the project locally clearly have good technical expertise; however, there is a need to document what they are doing on an on-going basis and to record the starting point for their work. However, it is important to note that a balance between new technical solutions and preserving traditional and regular practices of maintenance of the mosque which were typically carried out by local craftsmen must be found. Natural local trees that were originally used for building materials for the beams in the mosque have also disappeared due to climate change, so wood beams must be imported from Ghana. This drastically increases the price of resources needed to restore the mosque, as building materials aren't readily available anymore.  3D Model with Laser-Scanning  The Zamani Project, document cultural heritage sites in 3D to create a record for future generations.

The term Eigenlicht dates back to the nineteenth century, but has rarely been used in recent scientific publications. Common scientific terms for the phenomenon include \\"visual noise\\" or \\"background adaptation\\". These terms arise due to the perception of an ever-changing field of tiny black and white dots seen in the phenomenon. Eigengrau is perceived as lighter than a black object in normal lighting conditions, because contrast is more important to the visual system than absolute brightness. For example, the night sky looks darker than Eigengrau because of the contrast provided by the stars.  Cause  Researchers noticed early on that the shape of intensity-sensitivity curves could be explained by assuming that an intrinsic source of noise in the retina produces random events indistinguishable from those triggered by real photons. Later experiments on rod cells of cane toads (Bufo marinus) showed that the frequency of these spontaneous events is strongly temperature-dependent, which implies that they are caused by the thermal isomerization of rhodopsin. In human rod cells, these events occur about once every 100 seconds on average, which, taking into account the number of rhodopsin molecules in a rod cell, implies that the half-life of a rhodopsin molecule is about 420 years. The indistinguishability of dark events from photon responses supports this explanation, because rhodopsin is at the input of the transduction chain. On the other hand, processes such as the spontaneous release of neurotransmitters cannot be completely ruled out.

The overall reaction type is a combination of both an addition reaction as well as a rearrangement reaction. This reaction was discovered by Max Conrad (1848–1920) and Leonhard Limpach (1852–1933) in 1887 while they were studying the synthesis of quinoline derivatives. The Conrad-Limpach synthesis  Reaction mechanism  The mechanism begins with an attack of aniline on the keto group of the β-ketoester to form a tetrahedral intermediate. The newly formed oxide is then twice protonated to form the Schiff base, which then undergoes keto-enol tautomerization before an electrocyclic ring closing. The mechanism concludes with the removal of an alcohol, a series of proton transfers, and a keto/enol tautomerization to form a 4-hydroxyquinoline, the final product of the Conrad–Limpach synthesis. New Conrad Perhaps the most important step (and the rate-determining step) in the reaction mechanism is the annulation of the molecule via an electrocyclic ring closing. For this step, the Schiff base must be heated to ~250 °C for the ring closure to occur. Furthermore, the type of solvent used is very important to ensuring high yields of the 4-hydroxyquinoline product. In the early work, the cyclization was accomplished by heating the Schiff base without a solvent and the yields were very moderate (below 30%). Limpach reported many years later that the yields in the cyclization were raised to 95% in many cases when an inert solvent, such as mineral oil, was used for the reaction. The Conrad-Limpach reaction mechanism also involves multiple keto-enol tautomerizations, all of which are catalyzed through the use of a strong acid, often HCl or H2SO4. With much of the literature on the synthesis of quinolines, there is some discrepancy on whether a substituted 4-hydroxyquinoline or a substituted 4-quinolone is the final product of the Conrad–Limpach synthesis. Although the reaction product is often shown as a hydroxyquinoline (the enol form), it is believed that the quinolone (keto form) predominates. For the purposes of this page and based on the reaction mechanism as it is shown in Name Reactions: A Collection of Detailed Mechanisms and Synthetic Applications by Ji Jack Li, the product is a hydroxyquinoline.  Regioselectivity of β-ketoester: Knorr variation  In the reaction of aniline with a β-ketoester, there are two possible sites of attack for the aniline nitrogen atom: the very reactive keto group, or the less reactive ester group. When Conrad and Limpach first observed this reaction in 1887, it was run at room temperature, and gave high yields of β-aminoacrylate: the kinetic product. The reaction then continued to give the final product of 4-hydroxyquinoline. However, Ludwig Knorr observed that under higher temperatures (approximately 140 °C) the aniline would actually attack the ester group of the β-ketoester, leading to the thermodynamically preferred β-keto acid anilide product (albeit in less than ideal yields). Continuation of this reaction using the Conrad-Limpach mechanism led to the synthesis of 2-hydroxyquinoline. The initial synthesis of 2-hydroxyquinoline from a β-ketoanilide was reported in 1886 as the Knorr quinoline synthesis. Therefore, the overall reaction is sometimes called the “Conrad-Limpach-Knorr reaction”. Screen shot 2013-12-11 at 9.13.10 PM  Applications  The synthesis of 4-hydroxyquinolines and 4-quinolones is of great importance to a variety of fields, but most notably to the medical sciences due to their use as chemotherapeutic bactericidal drugs through their ability to kill bacteria. This mechanism involved disabling the bacterial topoisomerase II/IV enzyme (the target in most Gram-positive bacteria) or DNA gyrase (the target in Gram-negative bacteria), preventing the bacteria from unwinding their DNA and undergoing either DNA replication or transcription. The majority of drugs in clinical use are actually quinoline derivatives that belong to the subset fluoroquinolones, which have a fluorine atom attached to the central ring system, often at the C-6 or C-7 position. There are also many non-antibacterial medical uses for 4-hydroxyquinoline. Baba et al. showed that many quinoline derivatives show promise in their anti-inflammatory effects for the treatment of arthritis, Schmidt et al. delved into the progress behind treating drug-resistant malaria using 4-hydroxyquinoline derivatives, and Lui- Zai Gang et al. studied the use of quinoline derivatives as HIV-1 integrase inhibitors.

At the age of 19 he made his acting debut in Black, and has since appeared in many other television series and Japanese doramas. His birth name is . Biography Kurata auditioned for the role of Kotaro Minami in January 1987, when he had just graduated from high school. In a 2006 interview, Kurata had stated that, during the audition, he hadn't been able to portray the character appropriately, and did not think he would get the role. To his surprise, he was chosen by Shōtarō Ishinomori himself to play the lead role, beating some 8,000 other contestants. During this period, Kurata underwent intense training that included stage combat techniques, physical exercise sessions and acting and singing lessons. On October 4, 1987, Kamen Rider Black premiered on TBS to public and critical acclaim. The success of the series, which ran for 51 episodes, generated enough interest from Toei Company executives to persuade them to produce a sequel, something unprecedented in the Kamen Rider Series franchise. After finishing his work on Black, Kurata was approached by Toei and renewed his contract for one more year in exchange for a salary raise to work on Blacks sequel, Kamen Rider Black RX. This second series was less successful than its predecessor due to its witty and comical style, which differed deeply from the shadowy, darker tone of the original. In a 1989 magazine interview, Kurata said that although he preferred Black over Black RX (labeling the humor in the latter as \\"excessive\\"), he was glad the character enjoyed a positive and happy turn of events after Blacks sad ending. However, it is rumored that Kurata declined later invitations to reprise the role in fear of being typecast, as his stigma as a Kamen Rider was almost as strong as Hiroshi Fujioka's Takeshi Hongo in the first series, but such rumors remain unconfirmed. Following the end of Black RX, Kurata has appeared in various television series and dramas as supporting characters. He has apparently been out of the public spotlight after taking a hiatus from the entertainment industry, but came back to voice Kotaro Minami/Kamen Rider Black in Kamen Rider: Seigi No Keifu, as well as appearing in Battle of the Cooking Iron (Ore Gohan), pitting himself against Takayuki Tsubaki, known for his role as the title character of Kamen Rider Blade. In 2009, Kurata returned as Kotaro Minami in the movie Decade: All Riders vs. Dai-Shocker and also made a cameo appearance in Kamen Rider Decade, reprising his role as Kotaro Minami. He further reprised his role in 2015 for Super Hero Taisen GP.http://tokusatsunetwork.com/2014/11/21/tetsuo-kurata-returns-kamen-rider/ Away from the world of entertainment, Kurata owns a steakhouse called Billy the Kid in Kōtō, Tokyo.

He did not return to St. Kitts for more than 40 years. He once said, \\"I'm 100% British. I think, I act and talk like an Englishman, not like someone from the West Indies.\\" Encouraged by a cousin to take up bodybuilding, Fox won the 1969 Junior Mr. Britain at 18. He went on to win nearly every major bodybuilding contest outside of the IFBB, including the 1976 AAU Mr. World, the amateur 1977 NABBA Mr. Universe and the professional NABBA Mr. Universe in 1978 and 1979. Before turning Professional, Fox worked as a train driver on the London Underground. Joe Weider sponsored Fox's move to Los Angeles in 1981, and he competed in IFBB contests for the next 13 years. Bill Reynolds, then Flex magazine editor-in-chief, gave Fox the nickname \\"Brutal Bertil\\" for his high- volume and extremely heavy training. Fox placed second in two IFBB shows – the 1982 Night Of Champions and the 1983 Swiss Grand Prix (beating Lee Haney) and he finished fifth in the 1983 Mr. Olympia (his second of five Mr. O appearances). He competed in 12 IFBB shows from 1984 to 1994. Retiring from the stage, he returned to St. Kitts for the first time since 1952, to open Fox's Gym in the summer of 1995. Murder conviction On 30 September 1997, in St. Kitts and Nevis, 20-year-old beauty queen Leyoca Browne and her mother, 36-year-old Violet Browne, were fatally shot by Fox, then 46. Fox, who previously had been engaged to Leyoca, was arrested and charged with the murders. On 22 May 1998, Fox was convicted of murder of the two women. He was originally sentenced to death by hanging, but after an appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, his sentence was changed to life in prison.A letter from Bertil: Bertil Fox is serving a life sentence for double murder on the island of St. Kitts.

Gunasekaran, Maqsood Sandhu (2010) Handbook on Business Information Systems. p. 773 The most common form of interorganizational system is electronic data interchange, which permits instantaneous computer-to-computer transfer of information.  Overview  Interorganizational system permits the flow of information to be automation between organizations in order to reach a expect supply-chain management system, which enables the development of competitive organizations. This supports forecasting client needs and the delivery of products and services. Interorganizational system helps to better manage buyer-supplier relationships by encompassing the full depths of tasks associated with business processes company-wide. In doing these activities, an organization is able to increase the productivity automatically; therefore, optimizing communication within all levels of an organization as well as between the organization and the supplier. For example, each T-shirt that is sold in a retail store is automatically communicated to the supplier who will, in turn, ship more T-shirts to the retailer. An Inter-organizational system is an information system shared by one or more suppliers and customers Organizations might pursue an interorganizational system for the following reasons: #Reduce the risk in the organization #Pursue economies of scale #Benefit from the exchange of technologies #Increase competitiveness #Overcome investment barriers #Encourage global communication An examples of interorganizational systems is the Sabre (computer system). “ understanding of environmental uncertainty are leading to the horizontal relationships across organizations.\\"  References   Further reading  * F.J.

The Court found that the random checks violated the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned under section 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. However, the violation was saved under section 1 as it was a valid form of deterrence for a pressing problem of traffic safety. Background Gerald Ladouceur was pulled over by the police as part of a random traffic check. The police discovered that he was driving with a suspended licence. He was convicted of driving without a licence. Ladouceur challenged the provision of the Highway Traffic Act which authorized the police officers to do random traffic checks as a violation of sections 7, 8, and 9 of the Charter. The conviction was upheld on appeal. Reasons of the court Justice Cory, writing for the majority, upheld the conviction. He found that there was clearly a violation of section 9 as the basis for the stops were in the complete discretion of the police and entirely arbitrary. Furthermore, the consequences of failing to yield to the detention included severe penalties. He found that the act of stopping drivers did not constitute a \\"search\\" or a and so did not invoke section 8. Lastly, Cory refused to consider whether there was a violation of section 7, given that there was already a violation of section 9. The violation of section 9 was justified as a reasonable limitation under section 1. The government successfully established that there was a pressing and substantial objective of increasing highway safety, and that random stops were an effective means of achieving the objective through deterrence. This position was further supported by evidence of its effectiveness in other countries as well.

As of the entering class of 2017–18, students may take all three years of instruction at either location. The UI College of Law was established in 1909, has been a member of the Association of American Law Schools since 1914 and has been accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA) since 1925. In the 2018 rankings, US News & World Report ranked Idaho Law at # 109/203 A.B.A. accredited law schools in its annual law school rankings. The College of Law in fall of 2016 had an enrollment of around 300 students, with an entering first-year class of 97 students. As a public law school, new students hail from across Idaho and 18 different states and foreign countries. Over 70 undergraduate colleges and universities are represented. The college offers four areas of emphasis: Native American Law, Natural Resources and Environmental Law, Business Law and Entrepreneurship, and Intellectual Property and Technology Law. The college opened its Idaho Law and JusticexLearning Center in Boise in 2010, initially as a third-year program only. Second-year classes were added in 2014. The plans for a full three-year program in Boise, which UI had first discussed in the late 1990s and the state legislature had addressed in 2008,Idaho State Board of Education Resolution: To authorize UI to expand its offerings in Boise to a full third- year curriculum and to include a legislative appropriation in the FY 2010 budget for this expansion. The Regents recognize the statewide mission of UI for legal education. UI is instructed to re-visit the issue of funding and support for a full dual location model, including a full three (3) year branch curriculum in Boise, to continue collaboration with the Idaho Supreme Court on the Idaho Law Learning Center with respect to those programs to be delivered in Boise, and to return to the Regents for further discussion.http://www.boardofed.idaho.gov/meetings/minutes/2008/04_17_08/April16-18_2008%20_APPROVED_minutes.pdf were fully realized in 2017, after the Idaho Board of Education and the ABA approved the addition of first-year courses at the Boise campus. The Boise campus initially accommodated about 35 students annually; with the expansion to a full three-year program, it can now accept up to 60 first-year students. UI's addition of the Boise campus has led the University of South Dakota to consider establishing a second law school campus in Sioux Falls.

The curriculum is comprehensive; it includes emphases in Natural Resources & Environmental Law and in Native American Law, and in Business Law & Entrepreneurism. =Facility= The current law school building opened in the fall of 1973, and was named in 1984 for former dean Albert R. Menard, Jr. (1918–93). While he was dean (1967–78), enrollment (and faculty) tripled and the new building was conceived and constructed. The college was formerly housed in the south wing of the Administration Building. Menard stepped down as dean in 1978 and taught for six additional years until his retirement. The Boise location is in the Idaho Law and Justice Learning Center (ILJLC). The Idaho Law and Justice Learning Center (ILJLC) is a collaborative effort between the University of Idaho College of Law and the Idaho Supreme Court to create a center for legal education and civic engagement. The Idaho Law and Justice Learning Center, formerly the Ada County Courthouse, was constructed as part of the Depression-era Public Works Administration in 1939. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The building was constructed in the Art Deco style. Modern style and solid construction were intended to communicate confidence in the government and a positive outlook for the future at a difficult time in US history.

In this short Keystone film, Chaplin is instead a rich, upper-class gentleman (Lord Helpus) whose romance is endangered when his girlfriend (played by Minta Durfee) sees him being embraced by her maid and jumps to the wrong conclusion. She angrily sends Lord Helpus away, saying she never wants to see him again. Distraught, when Lord Helpus arrives home he is determined to end his life. He swallows what he thinks is a glass of poison and envisions himself being tortured in Hell. Not long afterward, the girlfriend's gardener and maid explain to Minta that Lord Helpus was not flirting at all. Minta quickly sends a note of apology to Lord Helpus. upon reading it, Lord Helpus flies into a panic and summons an ambulance to help him before he dies from the fatal dose of poison.

In the , Karumba had a population of 531 people.  Geography  Karumba is in the Gulf Country region of Queensland, by road from Normanton and from the state capital, Brisbane. Karumba is within the Shire of Carpentaria, the administrative headquarters of which is in Normanton. The town is sited at the mouth of the Norman River, and enjoys the distinction of being the only town along the southern Gulf of Carpentaria that is within sight of the Gulf itself (the Gulf's extensive tidal flats prohibits settlement elsewhere along its shore). The rare Morning Glory cloud rolls through Karumba in the early hours of some mornings in September and October.  History  The settlement was previously known as Norman Mouth and Kimberley. The toponym derives from the Kareldi native name, Kurumba, who were the indigenous landholders of this area before the onset of white colonization and expropriation.Norman Tindale,Aboriginal Tribes of Australia: Their Terrain, Environmental Controls, Distribution, Limits, and Proper Names, Australian National University 1974 p.174. This name was officially used for the township by the 1880s. Karumba Post Office opened on 22 August 1889 and closed in 1919. Given its access to the Gulf of Carpentaria, the town's economy has revolved largely around fishing. The prawn industry expanded in the 1960s. In the late 1930s the town was a refueling and maintenance stop for the flying boats of the Qantas Empire Airways. No. 43 Squadron of the RAAF also operated Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats from the town between June 1943 and April 1944. Karumba State School opened in September 1968. Karumba Public Library was opened in 1979. The region is repeatedly mentioned in the song \\"Every Passing Day\\" by Australian band Goanna on their album Oceania. At the 2006 census, Karumba had a population of 518. The Red Hot Chili Peppers' song \\"Animal Bar\\" from their 2006 album Stadium Arcadium is about Karumba. It is named after a bar called the Animal Bar.  Economy  The Karumba port services the Century Zinc Mine as well as fishing industry.  Facilities Karumba has a public library in Walker Street, visitor information centre, parks, bowls club, golf course, swimming pool, and a sports centre. The Carpentaria Shire Council operates a public library at Walker Street. Climate Karumba has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen Aw) with two distinct seasons. The “Wet” usually lasts from December to March and is extremely hot and humid, with wet bulb temperatures typically above during the afternoons. Most roads during the “Wet” are usually closed by heavy rain, which can exceed in a day due to the passage of tropical cyclones or monsoonal depressions which provide most of the rain. On occasions, however, as with all of Queensland the wet season may fail almost completely and produce less than in a full season. The “Dry” usually lasts from April to the middle of November and is much more comfortable due to lower humidity and milder morning temperatures. This period of the year is essentially bone dry and almost completely cloudless: median rainfall is nil between May and September and over twenty days each month are completely clear.

The fruit tends to be very pungent, and registers 30,000 to 50,000 on the Scoville Heat Unit scale. Pepper varieties in the C. baccatum species have white or cream colored flowers, and typically have a green or gold corolla. The flowers are either insect or self-pollinated. The fruit pods of the baccatum species have been cultivated into a wide variety of shapes and sizes, unlike other capsicum species, which tend to have a characteristic shape. The pods typically hang down, unlike a Capsicum frutescens plant, and can have a citrus or fruity flavor. The C. baccatum species, particularly the Ají amarillo chili, has its origins in ancient Peru and across the Andean region of South America. It is typically associated with Peruvian cuisine, and is considered part of its condiment trinity together with red onion and cilantro. Ají amarillo literally means yellow chili; however, the yellow color appears when cooked, as the mature pods are bright orange. Yellow ají is one of the ingredients of Peruvian cuisine and Bolivian cuisine. It is used as a condiment, especially in many dishes and sauces. In Peru the chilis are mostly used fresh, and in Bolivia dried and ground. Common dishes with ají \\"amarillo\\" are the Peruvian stew Ají de gallina (\\"Hen Chili\\"), Papa a la Huancaína and the Bolivian Fricasé Paceño, among others. In Ecuadorian cuisine, Ají amarillo, onion, and lemon juice (amongst others) are served in a separate bowl with many meals as an optional additive. In Colombian cuisine, Peruvian Cuisine, and Ecuadorian cuisine, ají (sauce) is also a common condiment. Cultivated baccatum (C. baccatum var. pendulum) is the domesticated pepper of choice of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile. The Moche culture often represented fruits and vegetables in their art, including Ají amarillo peppers.Berrin, Katherine & Larco Museum. The Spirit of Ancient Peru:Treasures from the Museo Arqueológico Rafael Larco Herrera. New York: Thames and Hudson, 1997. South American farmers also grow C. baccatum as ornamental plants for export. File:Capsicum bacatuum flower.jpgFlower File:C baccatum lemon drop fruit.jpgCultivar 'Lemon Drop'  Etymology  Some form of the word ají has been used since approximately 4600 BCE. It was first used in the protolanguage Otomanguean. It then spread along with the Capsicum fruit from Central and South America to other pepper growing regions. Capsicum baccatum is still referred to as ají, while other peppers are referred to as pepper via the Spanish conquistadors noting of the similarity in heat sensation to Piper sp. Its Latin binomial is made up of Capsicum from the Greek kapos, and baccatum meaning berry-like.Ají amarillo Cultivars This species of chili pepper includes the following cultivars: *Ají amarillo, also called amarillo chili and ají escabeche *Bishop's crown *Lemon drop, ají limón (not to be confused with ají limo, a Capsicum chinense cultivar) *Piquanté Pepper Larco Museum Collection.

The school, which describes itself as the \\"Home of the Rams\\" and is a part of the Bay District Schools, opened in 1961 as the second high school in Bay County. The school held its first graduation ceremony in 1964. The school was accredited by the SACS in 1963. In 2006, Rutherford had a student population of 1,755 students. Overview Rutherford High School offers several different tracks to its students. Rutherford is host to a chapter of the International Baccalaureate program, Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC), and the Communications and Technology Academy (Com/Tech). In addition, Advanced Placement, dual-enrolled, and honors level courses are available for all students. Extracurricular activities include sports, service clubs, and many other student organizations. Rutherford offers more themed academies than any of the other schools in Bay County. =Grades= Rutherford High School has consistently been ranked a \\"B\\" or \\"C\\" grade school under Florida's A++ Plan, the school's 2006-2007 score was \\"D\\". The school's current theme is \\"Whatever it takes!\\" with the aim of being ranked an \\"A\\" school and raising the achievement levels of all students in accordance with the No Child Left Behind Act. = Reviews and ratings = Rutherford High School has received some negative reviews; e.g. GreatSchools.org gave Rutherford a 4/10 rating, with mixed community reviews. =Controversy= In May 2019, Rutherford High School has received some controversy when a science teacher wrote an offensive comment \\"WTF is this? absolutely no credit\\" on a student's homework. This led to complaints from parents who pointed out the teacher's inappropriate manners. The teacher was disciplined by the administration. =Hurricane Michael= As most schools in Panama City, Florida were damaged by Category 5 Hurricane Michael in October 2018, Rutherford High School was used as an emergency shelter during the aftermath. The shelter residents experienced dissatisfaction with the school's role as a shelter. Others recalled its unsanitary conditions such as toilets being clogged with feces, poor quality foods, and the shelter lacking skilled doctors with licenses. After the storm it was announced that Rutherford would temporarily integrate as a 6-12 school for the remainder of the 2018-19 school year and for the 2019-20 school year after the neighboring Everitt Middle School had extensive damage. Educational programs =International Baccalaureate= International Baccalaureate (IB) began its authorization on campus in 1992. Rutherford High School's IB Program serves as a Magnet Program for the Bay County School District. Cathy Rutland serves as the program's coordinator for the 2015-2016 school year. IB classes (11th and 12th grade) are offered in six concurrent academic areas: Language A1: (First Language) including the study of selections from World Literature, Language B: (Second Language) or second Language A, Individuals and Societies (Social Sciences), Experimental Sciences, Mathematics, and The Arts and Electives. Pre-IB courses are also offered in all subject areas for 9th and 10th grades. =Communications Technology= Also known as ComTech, Rutherford's Communications Technology course consists of classes that teach students how to use many computer programs such as Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Flash and Adobe Premier. In addition to these program based courses, Comtech also has some core classes such as English and History. These classes however take a different approach to teaching the students. The ComTech curriculum is built around technology, thus many, if not all, of the classwork and lessons are built around programs such as Microsoft's Powerpoint, Excel, and Word.

Currently the plan is to run the railway through Turkmenistan to Iran; Iran is linked to Turkey and Europe's standard gauge systemTKTR project In May 2013, a new rail link opened between Uzen (Kazakhstan) and Serhetyaka (Turkmenistan), crossing the border at Bolashak. The railway is 146 km long and cost 65bn tenge. The railway is Russian gauge; there would be a break of gauge when the railway reaches the Iranian border. Construction for the new line will start at the eastern border town of Druzhba to go to Aktau on the Caspian Sea. Construction is expected to start in 2006 and take four years. The total cost of the project is $5–7 billion.TKTR project A link from Aktau to Iran is also required.

Originally a hamlet north of Woodbridge, it is now an enclave within that larger neighbourhood. History The lands located on the east half of lots 9, 10 and 11 of concession 7 were first patented to David Thompson on May 20, 1801. By 1830, it was a well settled community. John Smith (Schmidt), a farmer from Edgeley, came to Pine Grove where he erected a grist mill and saw mill in 1828. In 1831 he built a store. In 1840 John Smith sold the mill to John W. Gamble who later became the first reeve of Vaughan Township. The mill was sold to Gooderham and Worts in 1860. By the time of Confederation, Pine Grove was home to a flour mill, churches, three hotels, a blacksmith shop, harness shops, a spool factory, one common school and a large general store with a post office. A stage coach ran daily to Weston. On October 15, 1954, Pine Grove was hit by Hurricane Hazel. The flooding of the village along Islington Avenue destroyed several buildings and the Mill Dam. Up to 2008 it was the last operating mill on the Humber River, was being operated by the Hayhoe family, whom purchased the mill from Fred Hicks on June 1, 1935. Harold Hayhoe on June 1, 1935 bought Hicks Flour Mills and renamed it Hayhoe Bros.. He became the seventh owner of the mill dating back to 1828 and he paid more for the land that came with the business than the mill itself. Freshly graduated from the University of Toronto, Engineering, he took the advice of his father in the middle of the Depression and \\"got in the food business\\". Harold's brother Edwin joined him shortly after and a third brother Boyce came in 1939. For years the Hayhoe Bros. operated the mill in Pine Grove and built it into an efficient wheat milling business. Harold's son, John Hayhoe joined the company in 1964, one year after graduating from the University of Western Ontario with his MBA . In 1964 Harold Hayhoe bought out his two brothers Edwin and Boyce. In May 1968, Hayhoe Bros. became Hayhoe Mills Ltd. Don Hayhoe, another son of Harold's also joined the company in 1965 and together Harold and his two sons operated the business until 1985 when Harold Hayhoe retired. Harold Hayhoe, a true milling pioneer, died December 30, 1987. Don Hayhoe left the business in 1994 when John Harold Hayhoe, who had built the milling business into significant Ontario marketshare, bought him out. John Hayhoe owned the business until 1998 when ownership succeeded to his sons. Mark, Greg and Dean Hayhoe continued to own and operate Hayhoe Mills Limited until March 2007 when the mill was sold to New Life Mills, a division of Parrish and Heimbecker Limited. John Hayhoe, after a battle with Parkinson's disease died on June 20, 2007; the same day the transition of the mill to the new owners was complete. On July 1, 2008, Hayhoe Mills had a large fire and for the first time in 180 years the sound of grinding grain is not heard from the mill on the Humber. As of January 31, 2015, the area where Hayhoe Mills stood is scheduled to be converted into townhouses. The mill along with neighbouring homes have been demolished and townhomes are to be built in its place as well as across the street.

The Court held that section 2(d) does not include the right to strike. Background The province of Alberta referred a reference question to the Alberta Court of Appeal, which was eventually appealed to the Supreme Court. The questions concerned the constitutionality of prohibiting strikes and replacing them with compulsory arbitration. Opinion of the Court McIntyre, argued that the freedom of association is an individual right that protects collective activities which are already protected by individual rights. Thus, activities that are prohibited individually are also forbidden collectively. As such, a trade union cannot strike incident to a collective bargain. Dickson, in dissent, also agreed with the characterization of the freedom, but argued that the right is not associated with particular activities but rather is \\"a freedom of persons to join and act with others in common pursuits\\". Note that this case involved a \\"double-swing decision\\" where Dickson was assigned the reasons for the Court at conference but lost the signatures to McIntyre who then lost them to LeDain.

It was developed in 1952 at Washington State University by Harold Fogle, and named after Mount Rainier. It is a cross between the 'Bing' and 'Van' cultivars.Moore 2005 'Rainiers' are considered a premium type of cherry. They are sweet with a thin skin and thick creamy-yellow flesh. The cherries are very sensitive to temperature, wind, and rain. About 1/3 of a 'Rainier' cherry orchard's crop is eaten by birds.Hsiao-Ching 2001 Plant facts The standard root stock for the 'Rainier' cherry is the Mazzard cherry, a wild or seedling sweet cherry used as grafting stock. Mature 'Rainiers' reach a height of 30 to 35 feet and are widely adaptable to a variety of soil types. Trees should be well spaced to provide maximum sun exposure for individual branches, ensuring fully developed, sweet, ripe fruit at harvest time. 'Rainiers' will produce fruit in 3 to 5 years, with a bloom period in early April. The creamy light yellow to medium yellow-orange fruit develops a red blush and is ready to harvest late-June through early-July. 'Rainier' cultivars require pollination. Typical pollenizers are the 'Bing', 'Van', 'Lapins', 'Black Tartarian' and 'Lambert' cultivars. 'Rainiers' grow best in USDA Zones 4–9.

He gained recognition for his action as a tank gunner in France in which he destroyed four tanks in a day, including three Tigers (Tiger tanks numbers 312, 009 & 314). One of his opponents on that day, 8 August 1944 near St. Aignan de Cramesnil, France was the German tank commander Michael Wittmann, however whether Ekins fired the round that destroyed Wittmann's Tiger is disputed. Ekins died on 1 February 2012.  Operation Totalize  During Operation Totalize the 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry and elements of the 51st (Highland) Division reached the French village of St. Aignan de Cramesnil during the early morning of 8 August 1944.Reid, Brian. No Holding Back (Robin Brass Studios, 2005) While B Squadron stayed around the village, A and C Squadrons moved further south into a wood called Delle de la Roque. C Squadron positioned themselves on the east side of the woods and the understrength A Squadron positioned themselves in the southern portion, with '3 Troop' on the western edge of the wood. From this position they overlooked a large open section of ground and were able to watch as German tanks advanced up Route nationale 158 from the town of Cintheaux. On orders from the troop commander, they held their fire until the German tanks were well within range. Ekins, the gunner of Sergeant Gordon's Sherman Firefly (called Velikiye Luki, as A Squadron's tanks were named after towns in the Soviet Union), had yet to fire his gun in action. With the Tiger tanks in range, the order was given to fire. What followed was an almost 12-minute battle that saw Ekins destroying all three Tigers that '3 Troop' could see (there were actually seven Tiger tanks in the area heading north, along with some other tanks and self- propelled guns). A short time later, the main German counterattack was made in the direction of C Squadron. A Squadron (less Sgt Gordon, who had been wounded and had already bailed out of the Firefly) moved over to support them and in the resulting combat, Ekins destroyed a Panzer IV before his tank was hit and the crew was forced to bail out. Following the battle and tankless, Ekins was reassigned to another tank within the squadron as a radio operator and remained in this position for the rest of the war.  Speculation surrounding Wittmann’s death  Photograph of the wrecked Tiger 007, taken by French civilian Serge Varin in 1945, still in the field near Gaumesnil where it had been stopped a year before. Following the war, claims were made by or for the following units as being responsible for Wittmann's death: 1st Polish Armoured Division, the 4th Canadian Armoured Division, the 144th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps, and the RAF Second Tactical Air Force. Reid examined these claims and dismissed them based on the units' war diaries. In a 1985 issue of After the Battle Magazine, Les Taylor, a wartime member of the 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry, claimed that fellow yeoman Ekins was responsible for the destruction of Wittmann's tank. Veteran and historian Ken Tout, a member of the same unit, also published a similar account crediting Ekins. Historians have supported this position, and it became the widely accepted version of events. According to Hart, Ekins's unit was positioned in a wood on the right flank of the advancing Tiger tanks. At approximately 12:47, they engaged them, halting the attack, and killing Wittmann. Reid postulates that the A Squadron of the Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment, 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade, positioned on the left flank of the advancing German tanks, was responsible instead. Situated on the grounds of a chateau at Gaumesnil, the unit had created firing holes in the property’s walls and, engaged the advancing German tanks, including Tigers. The British tanks were between and away from the German line of advance, whereas the Canadian squadron was around away.  Later life  After the war, Ekins returned to Rushden, Northamptonshire and went back to work in the shoe factories near his home town. He retired 34 years later, after becoming a manager of one of the factories. He married and had two children.  Footnotes   Sources  *After the Battle Magazine, Issue 48. *Ellis, L.F.

Sites are generally classified based on how prepared they are and the speed with which they can be brought into operation: \\"cold\\" (facility is prepared), \\"warm\\" (equipment is in place), \\"hot\\" (operational data is loaded) – with increasing cost to implement and maintain with increasing \\"temperature\\".  Classification  A cold site is an empty operational spaces with basic facilities like raised floors, air conditioning, power and communication lines etc. Following an incident equipment is brought in and set up to resume operations. It does not include backed up copies of data and information from the original location of the organization, nor does it include hardware already set up. The lack of provisioned hardware contributes to the minimal start-up costs of the cold site, but requires additional time following the disaster to have the operation running at a capacity close to that prior to the disaster. In some cases, a cold site may have equipment available, but it is not operational. A warm site is a compromise between hot and cold. These sites will have hardware and connectivity already established, though on a smaller scale. Warm sites might have backups on hand, but they may not be complete and may be between several days and a week old. The recovery will be delayed while backup tapes are delivered to the warm site, or network connectivity is established and data is recovered from a remote backup site. A hot site is a near duplicate of the original site of the organization, with full computer systems as well as complete backups of user data. Real time synchronization between the two sites may be used to completely mirror the data environment of the original site using wide area network links and specialized software. Following a disruption to the original site, the hot site exists so that the organization can relocate, with minimal losses to normal operations in the shortest recovery time. Ideally, a hot site will be up and running within a matter of hours. Personnel may have to be moved to the hot site, but it is possible that the hot site may be operational from a data processing perspective before staff has relocated. The capacity of the hot site may or may not match the capacity of the original site depending on the organization's requirements. This type of backup site is the most expensive to operate. Hot sites are popular with organizations that operate real time processes such as financial institutions, government agencies and eCommerce providers. The most important feature offered from a hot site is that the production environment(s) is running concurrently with the main datacenter. This syncing allows for minimal impact and downtime to business operations. In the event of a significant outage event, the hot site can take the place of the impacted site immediately. However, this level of redundancy does not come cheap, and businesses will have to weigh the cost-benefit-analysis (CBA) of hot site utilization. Nowadays if the backup site is down and misses the \\"proactive\\" approach it may not be considered a hot site depending on the level of maturity of the organization regarding the ISO 22301 approach (international standard for Business Continuity Management).  Alternate Sites  Generally, an Alternate Site refers to a site where people and the equipment that they need to work is relocated for a period of time until the normal production environment, whether reconstituted or replaced, is available. Choosing Choosing the type of backup site to be used is decided by an organizations based on a cost vs. benefit analysis. Hot sites are traditionally more expensive than cold sites, since much of the equipment the company needs must be purchased and thus people are needed to maintain it, making the operational costs higher. However, if the same organization loses a substantial amount of revenue for each day they are inactive, then it may be worth the cost. Another advantage of a hot site is that it can be used for operations prior to a disaster happening. This load balanced production processing method can be cost effective, and will provide the users with the security of minimal downtime during an event that affects one of the data centers. The advantages of a cold site are simple--cost. It requires fewer resources to operate a cold site because no equipment has been brought prior to the disaster. Some organizations may store older versions of the hardware in the center. This may be appropriate in a server farm environment, where old hardware could be used in many cases. The downside with a cold site is the potential cost that must be incurred in order to make the cold site effective. The costs of purchasing equipment on very short notice may be higher and the disaster may make the equipment difficult to obtain.  Commercial Sites  When contracting services from a commercial provider of backup site capability, organizations should take note of contractual usage provision and invocation procedures. Providers may sign up more than one organization for a given site or facility, often depending on various service levels. This is a reasonable proposition as it is unlikely that all organizations using the service are likely to need it at the same time and it allows the provider to offer the service at an affordable cost. However, in a large scale incident that affects a wide area, it is likely that these facilities will become over-subscribed. An organization can request Priority Service from the provider, often with a higher monthly fee. The commercial site can also be used as the secondary production site with a full scale mirroring environment for their primary data center. Again, a higher fee will be required, but the security of the site and the ability of the organization to provide its users with uninterrupted access to their data and applications could justify the cost.

Hawley's The Himalayan Database became the unofficial record for climbs in the Nepalese Himalaya. She was also the honorary consul in Nepal for New Zealand. Biography =Early life= Hawley was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1923. She was educated at the University of Michigan and graduated with an honours degree in English in 1946. Having visited Kathmandu on a round-the-world trip in 1957, Hawley moved to Nepal full-time in 1959, giving up her job as a researcher for Fortune magazine in New York. In 1960 she started as a journalist and correspondent for Time, but later moved to the Reuters news agency in 1962. She covered the 1963 American Everest expedition that traversed Mount Everest. Her article on the death of the Nepalese prime minister made the front page of the New York Times. She socialized regularly with royalty and senior politicians in Nepal, on whom she reported for US media. =Climbing database= While she never climbed a mountain herself, Hawley was the best-known chronicler of Nepalese Himalayan expeditions from the 1960s onwards (she did not chronicle the Karakoram Himalaya such as K2 or Nanga Parbat), and was respected by the international mountaineering community because of the accuracy of her records, and the tenacity of her investigations; winning her the nickname \\"The Sherlock Holmes of the Mountaineering World\\". Italian climber Reinhold Messner told Outside, \\"If I need information about climbing 8,000-meter peaks, I go to her\\". Sir Edmund Hillary, one of her closest friends (she was an Executive Officer for Hillary's Himalayan Trust), once called her \\"a bit of a terror\\". Hawley's detailed mountaineering records are summarized in The Himalayan Database, and have been used both as a record of successful ascents, and also of establishing success rates and fatality rates, for climbers in the Nepal Himalaya. Having a Himalayan ascent logged on Hawley's database became an essential requirement for mountaineers, which lead to many famous disputes, including: =Awards and honours= In 2008, French ice climber François Damilano named a peak in Nepal after Elizabeth Hawley having made a solo first ascent of Peak Hawley (6,182 meters) in the Dhaulagiri Group on 9 May 2008. In 2014, the Nelapese State officially confirmed the naming of Peak Hawley. She was the honorary consul in Nepal for New Zealand for 20 years up until her retirement in 2010, for which she received the Queen's Service Medal in 2004. She was also awarded the Swiss King Albert I Memorial Foundation Medal in 1998 for services to mountaineering, and was the first recipient of the Sagarmatha National Award from the Government of Nepal. The former American ambassador to Nepal, Peter Bodde, described Hawley as one of Nepal's \\"living treasures\\" and that \\"her contribution to the depth of knowledge and understanding between Nepal and the US was immense\\".

Biography Dennis is a 1974 graduate of Kent State University. At age 22, Dennis served as sports director and weekday anchor for WDAF-TV, an NBC affiliate in Kansas City, Missouri. He later became a studio anchorman at WPSL radio. In 1977, he joined WNAC-TV Channel 7 (later WNEV and now WHDH-TV) in Boston. Over the next 21 years he covered the Boston sports scene for the station holding the following roles: weekend and weekday sports anchor, sports producer, sports director as well as producing several sports features and investigative reports. Dennis is involved with several Boston based charities, raising money for the Jimmy Fund, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and he is on the board of directors for the Mutual Funds Against Cancer Organization. Dennis has made cameos in many of the Farrelly brothers' films. In April 2015, Dennis entered an inpatient rehab facility to receive treatment for alcohol abuse. On August 18, 2016 Entercom announced that Dennis, under a doctor's advice to reduce his workload, would immediately leave the morning show but would still be at the station for fill ins, relations with advertisers, and special events. Since his demotion, Dennis has sold his house in Florida and performs odd jobs in his spare time. He continues to maintain an active Twitter presence as a supporter of Donald Trump and right-wing politics. Controversies =Boston Globe Ban= In 1999, the Boston Globe's executive sports editor, Don Skwar, banned its sportswriters from the Globe from appearing on the Dennis & Callahan morning show because of its perceived lowbrow humor. This came two weeks after he banned Globe sportswriters from appearing on WEEI's afternoon The Big Show after columnist Ron Borges appeared on the show and used a racial slur to describe New York Yankees pitcher Hideki Irabu. After the ban, WEEI retaliated by banning Globe sportswriters from all WEEI programs. =METCO controversy= On September 29, 2003, during a segment called 'headlines', where they read and comment about current news stories, Dennis and his morning co-host Gerry Callahan made racially insensitive remarks while discussing a story about an escaped gorilla. The gorilla had escaped from the Franklin Park Zoo and had been recaptured at a bus stop. Their on the air banter included these lines: > Callahan: \\"They caught him at a bus stop, right -- he was like waiting to > catch a bus out of town.\\" > Dennis: \\"Yeah, yeah -- he's a METCO gorilla.\\" > Callahan: \\"Heading out to Lexington.\\" > Dennis: \\"Exactly.\\" METCO is a state program that buses inner-city Boston students to nearby suburban schools. Many perceived the comments to be comparing poor, mostly African-American children to gorillas. WEEI general manager Tom Baker suspended both hosts for two days, then extended the suspension to two weeks after the Blue Cross-Blue Shield (Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts) pulled $27,000 in ads and in turn donated that money to METCO. Dunkin' Donuts responded by ceasing all advertising that involved the voices of John Dennis or Gerry Callahan. Both hosts apologized, though in a way many thought was sarcastic and insincere, and were sent to sensitivity training. WEEI also agreed to provide free advertising for the METCO program on the radio station. In November 2003, WEEI General Manager Tom Baker was replaced by Julie Kahn. Station executives denied there was a connection between the METCO incident and Baker's replacement. =Ryen Russillo voicemail= Dennis had a personal conflict with Ryen Russillo, who at the time was a New England Patriot commentator at WBCN, during which he left Rusillo a voicemail following a conversation between Dennis's daughter and Rusillo at a local Boston bar. Subsequently, Russillo lost that job. Russillo currently works for ESPN, which is heard in part on WEEI.

The name refers to the rocking action during the move: the weight is transferred from one foot to another and then back. It is used in a number of dances, such as East Coast Swing, Zydeco, Lindy Hop, Tango. Most often it is a two-step dance move executed in two beats of music. There are two basic versions: rock back and rock forward. They may start with any foot. Basic rocks In rock back, the dancer steps backwards with full weight transfer then transfers the weight back to the front foot while keeping it in place. In rock forward, the dancer steps forward with full weight transfer then transfers the weight to the back foot while keeping it in place. In some dances, e.g., East Coast Swing or Lindy Hop, the partners rock from opposite feet in opposite directions, i.e., both are doing rock back, e.g., during the basic step sequence: \\"triple step, triple step, rock step\\". In others the rocks are done from opposite feet, but in the same direction, i.e., when the leader rocks back, the follower rocks forward. Turning rocks In some dances (Tango, Argentine tango) the rock step is used to change the direction of travel. In such cases a one or both steps the dancer may perform a certain amount of pivot turn. In Lindy Hop, the turning rock step is also known as a rotational rock step, due to the rotation of the body's center to change direction or prep for a move. The degree of rotation in the turning rock step varies with how far the dancer wants to change direction. When used as a prep for a move, the degree of rotation depends on how much tension must be built up in the connection between the dancers in order to properly execute the move. Rock step vs break step Sometimes the terms rock step and break step are used interchangeably e.g., Forward Rock and Forward Break. The stylistic difference is that in the rock step the emphasis is in the rocking action during the step, while the term break carries the meaning of the change of the direction into the opposite, i.e., the forward break changes the direction of the movement from forward to backward. Dance variations named \\"Rock Step\\" *In Zydeco, the Rock Step is the name of a pattern obtained from the Zydeco's Basic Step if the leader on count 6 makes a little push for the follower to rock back (on 7,8) and rocks himself back.

Political symbolism is symbolism that is used to represent a political standpoint or party. The symbolism can occur in various media including banners, pictures, and flags.

Black flags have traditionally been flown by anarchism, and left-wing radicals to represent the absence of all oppressive structures. A combination of the two colors in a black flag represents social anarchism, such as anarchist communism and anarcho syndicalism. Many groups use the political colour associated with their political philosophy, for example blue, particularly dark blue, is often associated with conservative parties. Cultural groups may use symbols in what many consider to be a political way, for example LGBT symbols like the Rainbow flag are used to promote the political goal of LGBT rights. Individual parties often associate, officially or unofficially, with symbols — sometimes adopting or incorporating symbolism associated with ideologies they support. In some democracies these symbols are regulated by law, for example, in the United Kingdom, political symbols are regulated by the Electoral Commission.

Anonymous web browsing can be achieved via proxy servers, virtual private networks and other anonymity programs such as Tor. These programs work by sending information through a series of routers in order to hide the source and destination of information. Anonymity tools can be used to allow users to access online websites that are blocked in certain locations. However, there is never a guarantee of anonymity with these servers. These programs are still susceptible to traffic analysis. Proxy servers, which have a central point of knowledge, are also susceptible to collection of data by authorities. Moreover, cookies, browser plugins, and other information can be used to uniquely identify a user even if a user has hidden the IP address. Achieving anonymity When a user opens a web page, his or her IP address and other computer information (e.g. device fingerprint) becomes visible to the target web page's server. This information can be used to track the user. The user's IP address can be hidden via a proxy server or a VPN server, though this can be circumvented by just using the wrong browser. These types of servers work by sending a request to the target server from itself rather than from the user directly. For example, if a user requests to visit a link on a web page, the request will—instead of being sent directly to the web site server—be sent to the proxy server, which then relays the request to the targeted internet server. This hides the user's IP address from the target server, as only the proxy server's information is visible.Confident Ltd. \\"Anonymous Surfing, AnonIC.org, 2004 On the other hand, device fingerprints are relatively resistant to anonymization. While some data can be hidden or spoofed, this can actually make a particular user atypical and thereby less anonymous. Services NoScript and Tor, however, appear to be very effective for creating anonymity. Anonymous web servers generally work by placing an anonymous proxy between a user and the website they are visiting. These servers can be used to bypass restrictions and visit sites that might be blocked in a specific country, office, or school. However, simply hiding your IP doesn't make you anonymous on internet. There are cookies stored in web browsers and with smartphones, the locations can be tracked using GPS. To achieve complete anonymity, you need to use browsers that don't allow such activities or at least warn you when the websites are trying to use such features. Tor browser is one of the best tools available. Anonymous web browsing is useful to Internet users who want to ensure that their sessions cannot be monitored. For instance, it is used to circumvent traffic monitoring by organizations who want to discover or control which websites employees visit. If law enforcement officials suspect illegal activity, they can request logs from the user's Internet provider. Internet providers that emphasize protection of personal data will typically only save their log files for a few days, at which time they are deleted/overwritten by rotation. Many providers, however, keep log files indefinitely . Limitations to proxy servers Proxy servers have a number of limitations. Primarily, web pages will sometimes load at a slow pace as user information must be rerouted. Further, if the server is attempting to bypass suspicious software, some elements of a page may not load. Since personal information, such as credit card numbers and passwords, has been passed through an external server that could be accessed by anyone, proxy servers are more of a security hazard than browsing the web without a proxy (if not on an encrypted channel (HTTPS)).Roos, D. \\"How to Surf the Web Anonymously, HowStuffWorks.com, 11 June 2009 Browser add-ons like the Java virtual machine plugin and the Adobe Flash Player can be used to reveal the web surfer's IP address even if they are surfing through an anonymous proxy web server.

Narcosynthesis — also called sodium amytal interview, amobarbital interview, or amytal interview — uses a technique of free association as well as dream and transference material during the session as a basis for uncovering relevant topics for later therapeutic discussion. History Narcosynthesis (via sodium amytal and pentothal) procedures in the United States are extraordinarily rare today. However, they were widely used in the post-World War II era when only a very few psychiatric treatments were even available. Administered as an inpatient hospital admission and overseen by anesthesiologist - this procedure is only used in the most extreme cases in the United States. Information from outside of the US shows that, in countries such as India, Narcosynthesis has been used for the interrogation of possible suspects in criminal cases. There has also been some use of barbiturate hypnosis therapy in the past.McCall, W. Vaughn M.D. “The Addition of Intravenous Caffeine During an Amobarbital Interview”. Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience. 1992 November; 17(5): 195–197. Accuracy The accuracy of the therapy's results is debated. As in frank hypnosis, repressed unconscious thought may be more likely to come forth rather than consciously suppressed evidence. Yet there is a deficiency of the ego mechanism; therefore, the true manner for determining truth would most likely be carried out by uncovering conflicting responses through multiple questionings. In one prominent court case, a man was charged with housebreaking and sodomizing a disabled woman. Under hypnosis and the administration of sodium amytal, the man denied the charges, and said that he and the woman had engaged in a consensual encounter. The woman, after undergoing narcosynthesis herself, gave many conflicting versions of her initial claim of sexual assault. Eventually, she admitted to fabricating the story due to anger over past relationships. The judge in this case permitted for the first time the results of sodium amytal to be admitted as evidence in a federal case. He stated that although any testimony under the influence of barbiturates could not be foolproof, he found the exculpatory evidence was in this case very helpful in uncovering discrepancies that lead to a not guilty verdict. Criticisms Opponents of narcosynthesis argue that there is little scientific evidence to warrant its use as a reliable source of interrogation, citing misuses by the CIA and several Indian police agencies. The CIA is said to be responsible for at least one death due to the administration of LSD as a truth serum. India is referred to as the narcoanalysis capital of the world with so-called biscuit teams (behavioral science consultation teams) using pseudoscience to back illegal interrogations. Though security agencies worldwide have shown interest, inconsistent results have proven objective truth elusive, despite increased suggestibility. Advantages In 1930, Dr. William Bleckwenn introduced narcoanalysis as a therapy for severely schizophrenic patients or those who suffered from catatonic mutism. These people after being administered the drug would be released from their somatic state for short periods. They could carry on conversations, partake in meals, and behave as if completely healthy; however, the effect was temporary. After some hours, they returned to their prior condition. Despite these short-lived effects, the treatment was common practice in English asylums through the '40s and '50s.Miller, Michael M. “Certain Factors Pertaining to the Value of Narcoanalysis”. Journal of the National Medical Association. 1954 July; 46(4): 238–241. It was from this treatment that cathartic abreaction came into use as a treatment for soldiers following the Second World War. The administration of short-term barbiturates caused disinhibition which facilitated the soldiers' participation in psychotherapy.Lopez-Munoz, Francisco, R. Ucha-Udabe, C. Alamo. “The History of Barbiturates a Century after Their Clinical Introduction”. Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment. 2005 December; 1(4): 329–343. Therapists worked with the soldiers to recall battle traumas, and subsequently attempt to treat or reduce the effects of \\"shell shock\\" and other manifestations of psychological trauma associated with battle. By augmenting standard hypnosis with narcotics and \\"synthesizing\\" mental states through the power of hypnotic suggestion, a negative mental state could be replaced by a positive one. The efficacy of such techniques remains a source of debate among medical professionals; however, it is the ethical aspect of this area of psychology which provides the greatest challenge to society,Kala, A.K. “Of ethically compromising positions and blatant lies about ‘truth serum’”. Indian Journal of Psychiatry. 2007 Jan-Mar; 49(1): 6–9. as the malleability of the human psyche is well documented throughout history.

The first inhabitants of the Edgeley area immigrated from Somerset County, Pennsylvania, circa 1800. Early family names were Smith, Stong, Shunk, Hoover, Burkholder, Muskrat, Snider, Brown, and Dalziel. A Mennonite church, built of logs in 1824 on the northern portion of Lot #7, Concession #4, was one of the first churches built in Vaughan Township. A steam-powered shingle mill stood on the northwest corner of Highway 7 and Jane Street. A hotel was located on the northeast corner, with a general store on the southeast corner. The store contained the Edgeley post office from 1872 until 1960. Just south of the store, Samuel Snider operated a horse-powered cider mill. His son-in-law, Abraham Winger, and Abraham's brother Henry, later assumed the business, putting up a new steam-powered mill and producing apple cider, butter and jelly until the early 1900s. The area was also served by a blacksmith, a shoemaker, a casket maker, a dressmaking establishment, a chopping mill, a woodworking shop, which supplied wagons and buggies, two slaughterhouses and a community hall. The Edgeley farmers club was organized in 1917, and for years the farmers in the area obtained their supplies of coal, binder twine, salt and other necessities through the club. The club's annual oyster supper was one of the community's social highlights. The oldest extant Mennonite meeting house in Ontario was moved to Black Creek Pioneer Village during the autumn of 1976. Edgeley was famous for fruits (mainly apples), thereby supporting many of the settlers who worked its fertile lands. Almost the entire landscape of Edgeley was covered in fruit trees, most notably west of Jane Street and north of Highway 7. Because of these fertile lands, great success came to the town's settlers, and today, many streets in and around Edgeley have been named after them and their products.

After both British and Continental Army troops entered their winter quarters in early January, Continental Army regulars and militia companies from New Jersey and Pennsylvania engaged in numerous scouting and harassing operations against the British and German troops quartered in New Jersey. The British troops wanted to have fresh provisions to consume, and also required fresh forage for their draft animals and horses. General George Washington ordered the systematic removal of such supplies from areas easily accessible to the British, and companies of American militia and troops harassed British and German forays to acquire such provisions. While many of these operations were small, in some cases they became quite elaborate, involving more than 1,000 troops. The American operations were so successful that British casualties in New Jersey (including those of the battles at Trenton and Princeton) exceeded those of the entire campaign for New York. Background In August 1776 the British army began a campaign to gain control over New York City, which was defended by George Washington's Continental Army. Over the next two months, General William Howe quickly gained control of New York, pushing Washington into New Jersey.Ketchum, pp. 101–159 He then chased Washington south toward Philadelphia. Washington retreated across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania, taking with him all the boats for miles in each direction.Ketchum, pp. 160–241 Howe then ordered his army into winter quarters, establishing a chain of outposts across New Jersey, from the Hudson River through New Brunswick to Trenton and Bordentown on the Delaware River. The occupation of New Jersey by British and German troops caused friction with the local communities and led to a rise in Patriot militia enlistments. As early as mid-December, these militia companies were harassing British patrols, leading to incidents like Geary's ambush, in which a dragoon leader was killed, and increasing the level of tension in the British and German quarters.Fischer, pp. 184–199 On the night of December 25–26, 1776, Washington crossed the Delaware and surprised the Trenton outpost the following morning, December 26. Over the next two weeks, he went on to win two further battles at Assunpink Creek and Battle of Princeton, leading the British to retreat to northern New Jersey.Ketchum, pp. 293–379 This period, from December 25, 1776, through January 3, 1777, has become known as the Ten Crucial Days. Disposition of the armies Detail from an 1806 map showing the area where many of the skirmishes took place. General Washington established his headquarters at Morristown, separated from the coast by the Watchung Mountains, a series of low ridges. He established forward outposts to the east and south of these ridges that served not only as a defensive bulwark against potential British incursions across the hills, but also as launch points for raids.Fischer, p. 354 Over the course of January and February, Washington's Continental Army shrank to about 2,500 regulars after Washington's incentives for many men to overstay their enlistment periods ran out. A large number of militia from New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania bolstered these forces, and played a significant role that winter.Fischer, pp. 348–349 The British army was initially deployed from posts as far north as Hackensack to New Brunswick. The garrison, numbering about 10,000, was concentrated between New Brunswick and Amboy, with a sizable contingent farther north, from Elizabethtown to Paulus Hook. Militia pressure in January led General Cornwallis to withdraw most of the northern troops to the shores of the Hudson. The resulting concentration of troops overflowed the available housing, which had been entirely abandoned by its residents, with some of the troops even living aboard ships anchored nearby;Fischer, pp. 349–350 the cramped quarters led to an increase in camp-related illnesses throughout the winter, and morale was low.Fischer, p. 351 The area had been heavily plundered during the American retreat in the fall, so there was little in the way of local provisions.Fischer, p. 350 The men subsisted largely on rations such as salt pork, but their draft animals required fresh fodder, for which they sent out raiding expeditions.Fischer, p. 352 Tactics Early in the winter, Washington sent out detachments of troops to systematically remove any remaining provisions and livestock from convenient access by the British.Lundin, p. 223 General Cornwallis sent out small foraging and raiding parties in January. These were met by larger formations (numbering 300 and up) of American militia companies, sometimes with Continental Army support, that led on occasion to significant casualties. In one early example, Brigadier General Philemon Dickinson mustered 450 militia and drove off a British foraging expedition in the Battle of Millstone on January 20.Fischer, p. 355 Washington gave his commanders wide latitude in how to act, issuing commands that they were to be \\"constantly harassing the enemy\\", and that they should be aggressive in their tactics.Fischer, p. 353 These early successes depended in part on successful intelligence; one British commander reported being met with force \\"notwithstanding the Orders were given, but a few hours before the Troops moved.\\"Lundin, p. 224 Even supply convoys bringing provisions from outside the state to the large garrison at New Brunswick were not immune to the American attacks, where the Raritan River and the roads from Perth Amboy offered opportunities for sniping and raiding.Lundin, p. 225 Their difficulties led British commanders to change tactics, attempting to lure these militia units into traps involving larger numbers of British regulars.Fischer, p. 356 But even this was not entirely successful, as wily militia and Continental commanders including Continental Army General William Maxwell used superior knowledge of the geography to set even more elaborate traps. In one encounter in late February, British Colonel Charles Mawhood, thinking he had flanked a party of New Jersey militia, suddenly found his advance force flanked by another, larger force. As they were driven back toward Amboy, more and more Americans appeared, ultimately inflicting about 100 casualties. The elite grenadiers of the 42nd Foot, part of Mawhood's vanguard, were badly mauled in the encounter.Fischer, pp. 356–357 A British force of 2,000 was repulsed by Maxwell in another well-organized attack a few weeks later.Fischer, p. 357 The ongoing tensions took their toll on the beleaguered British. Johann Ewald, captain of a company of German jägers (essentially light infantry) who were often on the front lines, observed that \\"the men have to stay dressed day and night ... the horses constantly saddled\\", and that \\"the army would have been gradually destroyed through this foraging\\".Fischer, p. 358 Some forage was provided from New York, but it was never sufficient for the army's needs. As a consequence, the British were forced to provide many supplies from Europe, at great cost and risk to the Royal Navy.Mitnick, p. 52 Selected Actions Hessian Captain Johann Ewald (depicted later in life wearing a Danish general's uniform) was often near the front of the British lines. =Elizabethtown= A regiment of Waldeck infantry, a few companies of the 71st Foot and a troop of British light dragoons were stationed at Elizabethtown, New Jersey in the winter of 1776-1777\\\\. On 5 January 1777, a British cavalry patrol was ambushed by militia near the town. One trooper was killed and a second was wounded. The next day, about 50 Waldeck infantry emerged from the town with a small escort of light dragoons with instructions to clear the country. Led by Captain Georg von Haacke, the strong patrol was attacked near Springfield by New Jersey militia. In Elizabethtown, the soldiers heard distant gunfire. Hours later the bedraggled British horsemen came back without the foot soldiers. Eight or 10 of the Waldeckers were shot down and the entire party captured by the militia. Ordered to pull back to Amboy, the garrison hurriedly left on 7 January. As the troops evacuated Elizabethtown, the militia attacked the rear guard. In the confused retreat, the Americans captured 100 soldiers, the baggage trains of two regiments, and food supplies.Fischer (2004), p. 347, pp. 415-416. Fischer's dates in his narrative and his appendix differ by one day. The dates in the appendix were used for the two clashes. =Chatham, Connecticut Farms and Bonhamtown= On 10 January 1777, Colonel Charles Scott's Virginia Continentals captured 70 Highlanders together with their wagons at Chatham, New Jersey.Fischer (2004), p. 352, p. 416 Scott's brigade was composed of the 4th, 5th and 6th Virginia Regiments.Fischer (2004), p. 409 At Connecticut Farms on 15 January, 300 New Jersey militia commanded by Colonel Oliver Spencer attacked 100 German foragers. The Americans killed one enemy soldier and captured 70 more. The following day, 350 Americans set upon a large body of British foragers at Bonhamtown, New Jersey, killing 21 enemy soldiers and wounding 30 or 40 more. American casualties are not given in any of these actions. =Millstone and Woodbridge= At the Battle of Millstone, Brigadier General Philemon Dickinson of the New Jersey militia scored a brilliant success. On 20 January 1777 near Van Nest's Mill, 400 militia and 50 Pennsylvania riflemen crossed an icy stream and fought a pitched battle with 500 British regulars and three cannons. The British lost 25 casualties, 12 prisoners, 43 wagons, 104 horses, 115 cattle and about 60 sheep. The Americans admitted losses of four or five men. Afterward, the British refused to believe that they had been beaten by militia. On 23 January two British regiments were waylaid by Brigadier General William Maxwell near Woodbridge. The 200 New Jersey Continentals inflicted losses of seven killed and 12 wounded while only suffering two men wounded.Fischer (2004), p. 355, p. 416 =Drake's Farm= On 1 February 1777, Brigadier General Sir William Erskine, 1st Baronet set up a clever trap. He sent a party of foragers to Drake's Farm near Metuchen. When Scott's 5th Virginia tried to gobble up the small party, Erskine rushed his large force into action. Battalions of grenadiers, light infantry, 42nd Foot and Hessians appeared, supported by eight artillery pieces. Instead of fleeing, the Virginians launched a vicious attack which momentarily broke a grenadier battalion. Under intense cannon fire, the American attack was stopped, but the soldiers fought tenaciously until the British fell back toward Brunswick. The Americans admitted 30 to 40 casualties while claiming to have killed 36 British and wounding 100 more.Fischer (2004), p. 356, p. 416 The action was marred by an ugly incident when Lieutenant William Kelly and six other wounded Americans were abandoned during a tactical withdrawal. The frustrated British fell upon the seven helpless men with bayonets and musket butts and slaughtered them all. When the Americans recovered the mangled bodies they were infuriated. Brigadier General Adam Stephen exchanged a series of irate letters with Erskine, who denied all responsibility for the incident.Fischer (2004), pp. 377-378 =Quibbletown= Plan of Quibbletown by Johann von Ewald On February 8, 1777, General Cornwallis, with six British generals commanding a force of twelve battalions, about 2,000 troops, planned to attack the American militia, led by Colonel Charles Scott and the 5th Virginia Regiment, and Continentals led by Brigadier General Nathaniel Warner at Quibbletown, New Jersey, now New Market. However, the Americans refused to directly engage this foraging party, but attacked the flanks and rear as the British retreated to New Brunswick. Historian Fischer writes: \\"The British commanders were outgeneraled in the field.\\" Hessian Captain Johann von Ewald described the events in his diary and notes that \\"Since the army would have been gradually destroyed through this foraging, from here on the forage was procured from New York\\". Other skirmishes occurred in this area on February 20, March 8, and April 4. =Spanktown= On 23 February 1777, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood was sent with a reinforced brigade to destroy any rebel forces he could catch. He set out with a battalion each of light infantry and grenadiers, plus the 3rd Brigade.Fischer (2004), p. 356 The latter formation consisted of the 10th Foot, 37th Foot, 38th Foot and 52nd Foot,Fischer (2004), p. 395. The assumption is that the 3rd Brigade organization had not changed since 25 December 1776. recently transferred from the Rhode Island garrison.Fischer (2004), p. 350 Near Spanktown (now Rahway), Mawhood found a group of militia herding some livestock covered by a larger body of Americans waiting on a nearby hill. The British officer sent the grenadier company of the 42nd Foot on a wide flanking maneuver. Just as the grenadiers prepared to launch their assault, they were fired on from ambush and routed with the loss of 26 men. At this moment, Maxwell sent his superior force forward to envelop Mawhood's force. The American force included the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th New Jersey Regiments, the 1st and 8th Pennsylvania Regiments, and the German Battalion. Mawhood's surprised men were hounded all the way back to Amboy, which they reached at 8:00 PM. The Americans lost 5 killed and 9 wounded, and claimed to have inflicted 100 casualties. Mawhood admitted losing 69 killed and wounded and 6 missing.Fischer (2004), pp. 356-357, p. 417. The author includes \\"Stricker's Maryland regiment\\". Since its commander Nicholas Haussegger deserted and George Stricker was second in command, this unit must be the German Battalion of Marylanders and Pennsylvanians. Casualty estimates Historian David Hackett Fischer compiled a list that he describes as \\"incomplete\\", consisting of 58 actions that occurred between January 4 and March 21, 1777.Fischer, pp. 415–418 The documented British and German casualties numbered more than 900; a number of the events do not include any casualty reports. Combined with their losses at Trenton and Princeton, the British lost more men in New Jersey than they did during the campaign for New York City. Fischer does not estimate American casualties, and other historians (e.g. Ketchum and Mitnick) have not compiled any casualty estimates.Fischer, p. 359 Fischer notes that relatively few official reports of American (either militia or Continental Army) unit strengths for this time period have survived.Fischer, p. 382 Ending The 1777 military campaigns began to take shape in April. General Charles Cornwallis punctuated the winter skirmishes with an attack on the Continental Army outpost at Bound Brook on April 13\\\\. In the Battle of Bound Brook, he very nearly captured its commander, Benjamin Lincoln.Lundin, p. 255 Outnumbering the Americans 2,000 to 500, the British scattered the militia but met stubborn resistance from the 8th Pennsylvania Regiment. The British captured three 3-pound guns and 20 or 30 men and killed six Americans, but the bulk of Lincoln's force got away.Boatner (1994), p. 100-101 General Washington moved his army from its winter quarters at Morristown to a more forward position at Middlebrook in late May to better react to British moves.Lundin, p. 313 As General Howe prepared his Philadelphia campaign, he first moved a large portion of his army to Somerset Court House in mid-June, apparently in an attempt to draw Washington from the Middlebrook position.Lundin, p. 317 When this failed, Howe withdrew his army back to Perth Amboy, and embarked it on ships bound for the Chesapeake Bay.Lundin, pp. 325–326 Northern and coastal New Jersey continued to be the site of skirmishing and raiding by the British forces that occupied New York City for the rest of the war.See e.g. Karels or Mitnick for further details on the role of northern New Jersey in the war.

Its capital and largest city is Magburaka. The other major towns include Masingbi, Yele, Mile 91, Bumbuna, Yonibana, Matotoka. Mathora, Magbass and Masanga. Tonkolili District is home to the largest sugar factory in Sierra Leone, and one of the largest sugar factories in West Africa, that is located in the town of Magbass. Tonkolili District had a population of 530,776. The district occupies a total area of and comprises eleven chiefdoms. Tonkolili District borders Bombali District to the northwest, Kono District to the east, Kenema District and Bo District to the southeast, Port Loko and Koinadugu Districts. Tonkolili is strategically located in the center of Sierra Leone. The district is criss crossed by many rivers including the Pampana River and Sierra Leone's longest river, the Rokel. The Temne people make up the overwhelming majority of the population of Tonkolili District. The vast majority of the population of Tonkolili District are Muslims.  Demographics  The population is mostly Muslim and the people are largely from the Temne ethnic group. Economy Economically, there is significant potential for an extractive economy, specifically the mining of iron ore, bauxite gold and to a lesser extent diamonds. Today the biggest iron ore deposit in Africa and the third largest in the world, African Minerals Tonkolili Project, are found in the hills around Bumbuna, Mabonto and Bendugu. Agriculture also plays a significant role in the economy, the biggest bio energy company in Africa, Addax Petroleum, operates mostly in Mar in constituency 60. There is also a significant agricultural activity at the Magbass sugar production facility and refinery run by Complant, a Chinese construction engineering firm. A rubber factory is about to be established in the Mile 91 area. There are several hydroelectric power systems in the district, especially at Bumbuna. There is also as game reserve at Mamunta. However, economic development was hindered by the destruction of facilities during the 1991-2002 civil war. Echo Bar Industry Due to the intense nature of the Sierra Leone climate, the Tonkolili District has always had a vast harvest of cocoa beans each year. In 2003, the Echo Bars Ltd. Company lead a private acquisition of 85% of all cocoa production in the district. The chief taster, Echo Mufasa, (not to be confused with Mr. Eko) led this purchase to reasonable success, increasing production and efficiency in most areas of the cocoa production in the district. In 2009, the company went into recession and the land was rebought by the local government. Education Before the civil war, education was highly esteemed, especially in Arabic and English. Since the end of the conflict, schools have been rebuilt to a large extent and even new ones created, including an Arabic college. , the district was home to 310 primary schools which had nearly 74,000 students. It was also home to 15 secondary schools. Government Tonkolili District currently has nine Representatives in the Sierra Leonean Parliament, of which eight members were elected for a 5-year term.

It is a Romanesque castle with some original Gothic and Renaissance elements built in the 12th century. Bojnice Castle is one of the most visited castles in Slovakia, receiving hundreds of thousands of visitors every year and also being a popular filming stage for fantasy and fairy-tale movies.  History  Bojnice Castle was first mentioned in written records in 1113, in a document held at the Zobor Abbey. Originally built as a wooden fort, it was gradually replaced by stone, with the outer walls being shaped according to the uneven rocky terrain. Its first owner was Matthew III Csák, who received it in 1302 from the King Ladislaus V of Hungary. Later, in the 15th century, it was owned by King Matthias Corvinus, who gave it to his illegitimate son John Corvinus in 1489. Matthias liked to visit Bojnice and it was here that he worked on his royal decrees. He used to dictate them under a linden tree, which is now known as the \\"Linden tree of King Matthias\\". After his death the castle became the property of the Zápolya family (see John Zápolya). The Thurzós, the richest family in the northern Kingdom of Hungary, acquired the castle in 1528 and undertook its major reconstruction. The former fortress was turned into a Renaissance castle. From 1646 on, the castle's owners were the Pálffys, who continued to rebuild the castle. Finally, the last famous castle owner from the Pálffy family, Count János Ferenc Pálffy (1829-1908), made a complex romantic reconstruction from 1888 to 1910 and created today's imitation of French castles of the Loire valley. He not only had the castle built, but also was the architect and graphic designer. He utilized his artistic taste and love for collecting pieces of art. He was one of the greatest collectors of antiques, tapestries, drawings, paintings and sculptures of his time. After his death and long quarrels, his heirs sold many precious pieces of art from the castle and then, on 25 February 1939, sold the castle, the health spa, and the surrounding land to Czech entrepreneur Jan Antonín Baťa (owner the shoe company Bata). After 1945, when Baťa's property was confiscated by the Czechoslovak government, the castle became the seat of several state institutions. On 9 May 1950, a fire broke out in the castle, but it was rebuilt at government expense. After this reconstruction, a museum specializing in the documentation and presentation of the era of architectural neo-styles was opened here. Bojnice Museum is now part of the Slovak National Museum today.  Description  The castle is renowned for its attractions, including the popular Castle Fairytale, the International Festival of Ghosts and Spirits and the Summer Music Festival. The romantic castle is also a popular location for filming fairy tale movies, such as Fantaghirò. In 2006, the castle attracted about 200,000 visitors. It hosts the single most popular museum in Slovakia and has featured in many movies.

Dawes was born in Boston. Prior to the Revolution, he attended a regular school and worked as a mechanic. He ardently supported the Whigs, gaining infamy among Royalists; his house was plundered by the British when they withdrew from Boston in 1776. Later, he became active in politics, lived in a roomy house on Purchase Street beside John Adams, and worked as an architect and builder designing many notable buildings in Boston, including the Brattle Street Church and repairs and/or modifications on the Old State House in about 1772.Holland, Henry W.

The act is sometimes considered to be part of the \\"New Deal\\" though it was not supported by then President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the law was one of several pieces of United States legislation popularly known together as the \\"Bonus Act,\\" which was enacted after Congress overrode President Franklin D. Roosevelt's veto on January 27, 1936. Background Congress had sustained Roosevelt's previous veto of an earlier version of the bill in 1935, called the Patman Greenback Bonus Bill. The President addressed a joint session of Congress to deliver his veto message. As he concluded his speech, he handed the unsigned bill to the Speaker of the House. Within an hour the House overrode the veto by a vote of 322 to 98. Even before the Senate sustained the veto, proponents were planning another attempt at passage.New York Times: \\"Bonus Movement Swift,\\" May 23, 1935, accessed December 20, 2010 Roosevelt argued that the program would invite demands for similar treatment by other groups and that it was not a relief bill since it was not based on the demonstrated needs of the recipients. With respect to the veterans, aside from the wounded, he said: \\"I hold that that able-bodied citizen because he wore a uniform and for no other reason should be accorded no treatment different from that accorded to other citizens.\\"New York Times: \\"Highlights of Bonus Veto,\\" May 23, 1935, accessed December 20, 2010 Enactment Congress sent another version of the bill to the President on January 22, 1936.

The bonds paid interest at an annual rate of 3 percent from June 15, 1936, to June 15, 1945, higher than rates available to savings accounts. Amounts less than $50 were paid immediately. The bonds could not be sold, but the Treasury would redeem them for cash at any time after June 15, 1936. Most veterans redeemed their bonds promptly. The Treasury issued bonds worth $1.745 billion initially. Between June 1935 and June 1936, 80% of the bonds issued had been redeemed. The Treasury paid more than $800 million in cash in the last two weeks of 1936 and almost $700 million more in the next year. The cash payments constituted an efficient economic stimulus since the program required little government administration, the monies were likely to be spent without delay, and the entire process did not require the long lead time of a public works program.Lester G.

Part of the system's Croton Watershed, it is 25 miles (40 kilometres) north of the City. It was constructed at the beginning of the 19th century by impounding the Muscoot River, a tributary of the Croton River, in turn a tributary of the Hudson River. The reservoir was once much smaller, but the other side of the original dam was intentionally flooded to make the reservoir bigger, when a new dam was built downstream. The original dam is still standing, and divides the reservoir in two. During construction, the New York Central Railroad moved Bridge L-158 from the Rondout Creek near Kingston to carry its Mahopac Branch across a section of the reservoir near Goldens Bridge. It remains today even though service on the branch ended in 1960. In 1978 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the only remaining double-intersection Whipple truss railroad bridge in the state. The reservoir was completed in 1905 and serves as the main collecting point for all the reservoirs in the Croton Watershed (except for the New Croton Reservoir, which later receives its water). It is almost 8 miles (almost 13 km) long, can hold up to of water at full capacity, and has a 76 square mile (121.6 km²) drainage basin. Water from the Muscoot Reservoir flows down the balance of the Muscoot River, then enters the Croton River to flow into the New Croton Reservoir. From there it enters the New Croton Aqueduct and flows south into the Jerome Park Reservoir in The Bronx. It continues on to Manhattan, where it mixes with water from the Catskill Aqueduct, into Brooklyn, then ends in Staten Island at the aqueduct's termination.

The act was implemented in Federal Reserve Board Regulation E. Rights of consumers The EFT Act recognizes their right to nominate the financial institution to which such payments are to be made. The EFT Act also prohibits a creditor or lender from requiring a consumer to repay a loan or other credit by electronic fund transfer, except when there is an overdraft on checking plans. Financial institution liability The financial institution must give the customer notice of their liability in case the card is lost or stolen. This must include a phone number for reporting the loss and a description of its error resolution process.  Limit to customer liability on loss or theft of card If a customer reports to the financial institution that their card is missing before any transactions takes place, they are not held responsible for any transaction that takes place after the report of a missing/stolen card. A customer can be liable for unauthorized withdrawals if their card is lost or stolen and they do not follow certain criteria: *Loss is limited to $500 if institution is notified within two business days *Loss could be up to $5000 if institution is notified between 3 and 59 days *If loss is not reported within 60 business days customer risks unlimited loss on transfers made after the 60-day period – could lose all money in account plus maximum over draft if any EFT errors  EFT is not a perfect system; therefore customers should still be diligent in reviewing their EFT statements for possible errors as they would with any other type of transaction. Should a customer notice that there has been an error in an electronic fund transfer relating to their account certain steps must be taken: Under the Act, the customer must: *Write or call the financial institution immediately if possible *Must be no later than 60 days from the date of erroneous statement *Give their name and account number *Explain why they believe there is an error, the type, dollar amount and date *May be required to send details of the error in writing within 10 business days Under the Act, the financial institution must: *Promptly investigate the error and resolve it within 45 days *Errors involving new accounts (opened last 30 days), POS transactions, and foreign transactions may take up to 90 days *If it takes more than 10 business days to complete the investigation: **Must recredit the amount in question *For new accounts may take up to 20 business days to recredit the account *Must notify customer of the results of investigation: **If there was error – correct it or make recredit final **If no error – explanation in writing, notify customer of deducted recredit *Customer has the right to ask for copies of any documents relied on in the investigation What the EFT Act Covers *The EFT Act does not apply to all preauthorized plans. The EFT Act does not apply to automatic transfers from any account held in the name of the institution the consumer uses to the account the consumer uses. **An example of this would be where the EFT Act would not apply to any automatic payments put towards a mortgage held by the financial institution where a consumer would hold their electronic funds account. *The EFT Act would also not apply to automatic transfers among a consumer's account at a specific financial institution. *The EFT Act also does not cover all transfers. Some banks, other financial institutions, and vendors will produce cards with a cash value imprinted into the card itself **Examples of these include public transit passes, store gift cards, and prepaid telephone cards. These cards may not be covered by the EFT Act. *When using electronic funds transfer, the Act does not give the consumer the right to stop payment. *State law or any contract that imposes a lower liability limit than those mentioned in the “Loss or Theft: Customer Liability” will be preempted (overridden) by the federal EFT Act unless the state law provides protections that are greater than that provided under Federal law.

Males develop it more frequently than females. It has also been reported in goshawks, bustard chicks, and psittacine birds (budgerigars, macaws, and conures). The syndrome is acquired in young birds. Due to a high-calorie diet, especially one high in proteins and/or low in vitamin D, vitamin E, and manganese, one or both carpus (wrist) joints are delayed in their development relative to the rest of the wing; for reasons unknown, if only one wing is affected, it is usually the left one. The result is a wrist which is twisted outwards and unable to perform its usual function. Angel wing symptoms include stripped remiges (flight feathers) in the wrist area, or remiges protruding from wings at odd angles. In extreme cases, the stripped feathers may resemble sickly blue straws protruding from wings. In adult birds, the disease is incurable and usually leads to an early death, as affected birds are rendered effectively or totally flightless. In young birds, wrapping the wing and binding it against the bird's flank, together with feeding the bird a more nutritionally balanced diet, can reverse the damage. The theorized causes of angel wing are genetics, the excessive intake of carbohydrates and proteins, together with insufficient intake of vitamin E, low dietary calcium and manganese deficiency. Angel wing is occasionally observed in waterfowl residing near humans, (including domestic fowl), and the disease can sometimes be observed in areas where geese or ducks are excessively fed bread. Duck seed is an alternative for duck feeders.

The switches provide a dedicated connection to each workstation. A switch allows for many conversations to occur simultaneously. Before switches, networks based on hubs data could only allow transmission in one direction at a time, this was called half-duplex. By using a switch this restriction is removed; full-duplex communication is maintained and the network is collision free. This means that data can now be transmitted in both directions at the same time. Fully switched networks employ either twisted-pair or fiber-optic cabling, both of which use separate conductors for sending and receiving data. In this type of environment, Ethernet nodes can forgo the collision detection process and transmit at will, since they are the only potential devices that can access the medium. This means that a fully switched network is a collision-free environment. The core function of a switch is to allow each workstation to communicate only with the switch instead of with each other. This in turn means that data can be sent from workstation to switch and from switch to workstation simultaneously. The core purpose of a switch is to decongest network flow to the workstations so that the connections can transmit more effectively; receiving transmissions that were only specific to their network address. With the network decongested and transmitting data in both directions simultaneously this can in fact double network speed and capacity when two workstations are trading information. For example, if your network speed is 5 Mbit/s, then each workstation is able to simultaneously transfer data at 5 Mbit/s.

Opened on June 15, 1958, the museum is in the town of La Pointe, Wisconsin on Madeline Island, one of the Apostle Islands in Lake Superior. Madeline Island Museum was developed on the former site of the American Fur Company Northern Outfit, and its main building once served as an American Fur Company warehouse. The museum can be reached by boat or by the Madeline Island Ferry. Front lawn of the museum One of the museum's historic buildings Madeline Island is the only member of the Apostle Islands that is not included in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, and is therefore the only island in the group open to commercial development. The historic unincorporated community of La Pointe, was established by French fur traders as a trading post in 1693. Later, in the 19th century, the American Fur Company established a post on the island. Because it was an ancient Native American settlement, and had served for so long as a fur trading site, as well as being the center of early missionary efforts in the area, Madeline Island was deemed an ideal location for a museum relating to important aspects of Wisconsin's history. Inspired by the island's history, two longtime summer residents of the island, Leo and Bella Capser, began organizing in 1955 to create Madeline Island Museum. With the help of many other residents of the island, they compiled a large collection of local artifacts for the museum. To house the artifacts, a wooden structure was constructed by combining pieces of several of the island's historic buildings, including a former La Pointe jail and the American Fur Company's post. The museum opened on June 15, 1958. Ten years later, it was transferred to the Wisconsin Historical Society, which has operated the museum ever since. Today Madeline Island Museum features exhibits on several aspects of Madeline Island history. The main displays focus on the area's Native American tribes, the fur trade, early missionaries who visited Madeline Island, and the region's maritime history. These exhibits are housed in two buildings, the original museum building built in the 1950s and the Casper Center, an exhibit hall constructed in the 1990s. , the museum had approximately twelve thousand visitors annually.\\"Historic Sites in Wisconsin.\\" Wisconsin Blue Book. 2006 ed.

Through the 1950s into the 1960s the Chicago Police Department's Red Squad unit visited them several times because of College of Complexes's anti-Cold War stance. The College of Complexes claims to be a \\"Playground for People Who Think,\\" and seeks \\"to disquiet the minds of the people.\\" The primary function of this group is to organize weekly free speech forums where speakers, representing diverse points of view, will make a presentation. Following the speech, audience members are invited to make \\"remarks and/or rebuttals,\\" and each is allowed a maximum of 5 minutes to respond. Order is maintained at meetings by adherence to the college's only, and long-standing rule, of listening to \\"One Fool at a Time.\\" The diverse topics covered in this forum have included: \\"Frederic Bastiat and 'The Law'\\", \\"Universal Law and the Code of Humanity\\", \\"Why I Refuse to Confirm or Deny Anything\\", \\"A Revolutionary Party for a Reactionary Period\\", \\"The Non-Fiction of Ayn Rand: 'The Virtue of Selfishness' and 'Capitalism: The Unknown Idea'\\", \\"The Persistence of Nationalism\\", \\"Evolving Concept of Wilderness\\", \\"The Manifesto of Resistance\\", \\"The Roots of the Welfare State\\", \\"How to Become a Millionaire in a Few Days\\", \\"How to Photograph a Spirit\\", \\"The Libertarian Party Platform\\", \\"Time - Defining the Nonspacial Continuum\\", \\"Archeology and Life in an Eco-Village\\", \\"Institutionalized Salvation Belief Systems\\", \\"Astrology / Horoscope of the United States\\", \\"Lessons of the Russian Revolution\\", \\"Why Peace is Neither Necessary Nor Desirable\\", \\"Hidden Themes of the Bible\\", \\"Living in Marijuana Consciousness\\", \\"The Conspiracy Against Reality\\", and \\"The History and Ideas of the Libertarian Movement.\\" The college has issued a \\"Statement of Free Speech\\" which maintains that: \\"Our constitution and laws encourage the freest possible exchange of opinions, ideas, and information. In part, that recognizes our worth and dignity as human beings. To forbid us to speak our minds demeans us and makes us more like slaves or robots than citizens of a free country. But as important as freedom of expression is for us as individuals, it is perhaps more important to society at large.\\" Currently, the College of Complexes holds these forums at Dappers East Restaurant, 2901 West Addison Street in Chicago, IL on Saturday evenings from 6:00 to 9:00 PM. All meetings are open to the public, with a $3.00 tuition fee and no membership is maintained. The college is volunteer operated. Anyone wishing to speak may do so by contacting the Program Coordinator. Over 150+ programs have been videotaped, and an archive termed a \\"Lecture Library\\" is maintained at the website. The College currently meets at Dappers East Restaurant, located at 2901 W Addison St, Chicago, IL. Program meets every Saturday night at 6:00 PM. Several satellite campuses have been opened in other cities from time to time, with one presently meeting in Dallas, TX.

Other variants of this tale include The Girl Without Hands, Penta of the Chopped-off Hands, Biancabella and the Snake, and The One-Handed Girl.Heidi Anne Heiner, \\"Tales Similar to the Girl Without Hands\\" Synopsis An orphaned brother and sister moved to another place where the brother opened a shop and married. One day, he told his sister to keep the house. The wife was offended, broke all the furniture, and blamed the sister. The brother said they could buy more. The wife killed his favorite horse and blamed the sister. The brother said the dogs could eat it. Finally, the wife gave birth, cut off the baby's head, and blamed the sister. The brother took his sister and drove the carriage into a bramble. He told his sister to disentangle. When she started, he cut off both her arms at the elbow and drove off. His sister wept but found her way through the forest to a merchant town. There a merchant's only son fell madly in love with her and married her. After two years, he went on a journey, but told his parents to send him word as soon as his child was born. His wife gave birth to a boy whose arms were gold to his elbows, with stars on his sides, the moon on his forehead, and the sun near his heart. His grandparents wrote to their son, but the wicked sister-in-law had heard and invited the messenger to her house. There, she tore the letter to pieces and replaced it with one saying his wife had given birth to a baby half wolf and half bear. This grieved the merchant's son, but he wrote back that the baby was not to be molested until he returned. The sister-in-law invited the messenger in again, and substituted a letter saying that his wife should be driven out at once. His parents tied the baby to her breast and sent her away. She went away and tried to drink from a well. Her baby fell into the water. She wept and tried to think how she could get the baby out. An old man told her to reach for the baby, despite having no arms; she did so, and her arms were restored and she reached her baby. She thanked God and went on, coming to a house where her brother and husband were staying. Her sister-in-law tried to keep her out as a beggar woman, but her husband said she could tell stories. She told her own, and they unwrapped the baby and saw she had told the truth. Her brother tied his wife to the tail of a mare; it returned with only her braid, the rest strewn over the field. They harnessed the horses and went back to the husband's mother and father.

Atisha, the renowned pandita, is sometimes listed as a notable abbot. Modern Era: In the vicinity of the town, now stands the thermal power project from NTPC, known as KhSTPP. The project has an installed capacity of 2340 MW developed in two stages. The first stage had 4 units of 210 MW capacity each and the second expansion had 3 units of 500 MW.

It is famous for ancient Vikramashila, founded by Dharmapala, a Pala King, in the 8th century, the educational institution served as a learning center of Tantric Buddhism. At the center of the building was a huge Buddhist temple, surrounded by 108 smaller temples. The remains excavated from this university made Vikramashila one of the most important historic places near Kahalgaon. It produced eminent scholars who were often invited by foreign countries to spread Buddhist learning, culture and religion. The most distinguished and eminent among all was Atisa Dipankara, the founder of Lamaism in Tibet.

After his defeat at the hands of Sher Shah, the mighty Pathan ruler, he took refuge with the Mughal Emperor Humayun at Chunar. In his absence from Bengal his capital was stormed and sacked and his two sons were murdered by the Afghans. Mahmud Shah, after joining hands with the Mughal emperor Humayun, advanced as far as Kahalgaon to attack Sher Shah.

In 1780, the king of Oudh State dispatched a British force, led by one Major Byng, to the area to subdue local rulers across the Gogra and bring them back under the nazims of Gonda and Bahraich. The British made an encampment at Sakrora and maintained it for 8 years. A few years later, in 1802, another British force under one Colonel Fooks reoccupied the old encampment at Sakrora. When a bazaar sprang up, it was named Colonelganj in his honour. The new encampment at Colonelganj lasted until the Indian Rebellion of 1857, when it was abandoned. Writing in 1877, William Charles Benett described Colonelganj as a rapidly growing centre of trade, owing to its central location between Gonda, Bahraich, and Balrampur. The trade dealt almost exclusively in the export of grain (mainly rice) and oil- seeds (mustard and alsi); Colonelganj served as a depot where those goods were brought from the surrounding countryside before being exported. Imports were far less in amount than exports; imports included salt from Kanpur, copper vessels from Bhagwantnagar and Mirzapur, and cotton. There were two bazaars per week in Colonelganj, on Mondays and Tuesdays. The population of Colonelganj in 1877, according to Benett, was 5,898, of whom 4,730 were Hindu.

He appeared in Green Goblin stories throughout the 1990s, generally portrayed as hating Spider-Man. Fictional character biography Normie Osborn is the child of Liz Allan and Harry Osborn.The Amazing Spider-Man #263 (April 1985) Harry's sanity recovered shortly before dying from a modified version of the Goblin formula, saving Spider-Man and saying \\"You're my best friend\\"; Normie is shown overhearing this, possibly changing his view of Spider-Man.Spectacular Spider-Man #200 While still recovering from his father's death, Normie is befriended by Peter Parker, a sort of surrogate uncle to him.The Spectacular Spider-Man Annual 14 A trio of robotic \\"Goblin women\\" (one of a number of failsafes prepared by Harry before death) kidnap Normie, intending to turn him into a new Green Goblin. Spider-Man and the Molten Man (Normie's uncle) defeat them before he can be exposed to the Goblin formula.Spider-Man: Legacy of Evil Norman Osborn Sr. returned from the dead, using a robot Goblin to kidnap his heir. This version appears as the standard Green Goblin, and causes Normie to believe his father has returned. This is part of a complex ploy to increase Norman's visibility by playing the unfortunate grandfather. Norman dismisses the possibility of his grandson being the new Goblin, saying having the same weaknesses as Harry. Normie is seen in a Sensational Spider-Man issue playing baseball, being watched from the stands by the Molten Man and the Chameleon, while Electro is in the shadows. No harm comes to Normie, but the Chameleon uses his safety as a bargaining chip to bring the Molten Man into his plan to attack Spider-Man after the hero's recent unmasking. Normie reappears after the One More Day storyline. Now Normie hates his father for supposedly abandoning him when Harry was mistakenly believed dead while being high on the Goblin serum. His hatred for Spider-Man is also reignited.The Amazing Spider- Man #581-582 Osborn's re-establishes himself as a major crime lord, undergoing plastic surgery to also establish himself as a businessman to provide a suitable inheritance for his grandson, with Liz apparently helping Norman in this endeavor.Superior Spider-Man #31 When Osborn acquires the Carnage symbioteAmazing Spider-Man #794 and transforms into the Red Goblin, Osborn attempts to gain his grandson Normie's aid by infusing a portion of the Carnage symbiote into Normie, turning into \\"Goblin Childe\\".Amazing Spider-Man #799 Despite the symbiote amplifying Normie's jealousy of his half-brother Stanley, Normie throws off its influence when he witnesses his grandfather try to kill his parents, realizing in the process that the villain was actually his own grandfather and not Spider-Man. The symbiote fragment is subsequently separated from Normie while the main symbiote is apparently destroyed during the final battle between Red Goblin and Spider-Man. It is implied that Liz and Mark kept at least some of the symbiote in storage for some future use. However, it showed that some of the symbiote still remained in his body, swirling in the boy's eye.Amazing Spider-Man #800 When Cletus Kasady was resurrected by a cult who worships the fallen symbiotic god Knull and obtain his power to unleash chaos on Earth, Normie begin to feel its fearful presence and got help from Spider-Man and Eddie Brock, and brought to the Maker where he meets Dylan Brock, Eddie's son.Absolute Carnage #1 Other versions =MC2= Normie Osborn as the Green Goblin. In the MC2 alternate future, little Normie Osborn is all grown up. A sensitive boy, he took his mother's remarrying hard, never getting along with his stepfather, Foggy Nelson (until after her death when the two finally bonded), and he held Peter Parker responsible for the death of his father and grandfather. When his mother became ill and died, Normie broke down, accepting his father's and grandfather's mantle as the Green Goblin as his destiny, seemingly convincing himself that his grandfather was a benevolent man driven to violence by the 'demon' of Spider-Man. His appearance as the Green Goblin forced May Parker to adopt the mantle of Spider-Girl. His first few appearances met with failure as he was continually defeated by Spider-Girl, Phil Urich (as the Golden Goblin), and even in one instance by Mary Jane Parker. Then one day, when May had temporarily lost her powers, Normie kidnapped her, unmasked her, tied her up and taunted her with a knife, ranting about their 'destined' family history of opposition. May realized that Normie was hoping she would break free and kill him. At this time, May was able to convince him to go get help and to forsake the Goblin legacy. Normie reformed, and even helped May continue on as Spider- Girl during her temporary power loss by lending her his goblin equipment (Normie also confided in her that he was actually acrophobic). He later also helped Phil Urich return to costume as the good Green Goblin. For a time, Normie converted one of his grandfather's old Goblin hideouts into a kind of \\"batcave\\" from which May and Phil could use as a base of operations, which he christened \\"the Website.\\" However, the Website was later located and destroyed by Canis' people. While in group therapy (for former supervillains), he began dating Brenda Drago (the daughter of Blackie Drago), much to the chagrin of May who had developed a crush on him. During the events of the Season of the Serpent storyline, May confessed her feelings to Normie, but Normie did not think it would be appropriate. However, after he is shot in the chest by Mr. Nobody in the Marked For Death arc (who shot him to mess with May's head), Normie's true feelings are revealed in a coma vision where his grandfather taunts him, \\"All you had to do was kill the girl. But no you had to fall in love with her, and how's that working out for you, Normie?\\" The vision of Norman also taunts him that \\"you will never truly be rid of me.\\" His relationship with Brenda became rocky for a time when Élan DeJunae appeared to inform him of their betrothal which had been arranged by her father and Norman when Normie and Élan had just been children. Normie was not thrilled with the news, and Élan decided it was up to her to make sure that Normie was true to the family legacy. First, she attempted to expose him to the Goblin chemicals, but she was foiled by Spider-Girl. Normie was submerged in the chemicals for a long time, but he said the doctors gave him a clean bill of health. Next Élan objected to his wedding to Brenda by literally crashing it. She forcibly bonded the Venom symbiote to him as a \\"wedding gift.\\" The new Venom went on a rampage until Normie with the help of Spider-Girl was able to gain control of the symbiote. May told him to cast it into the fire, but Normie could not bring himself to kill it. \\"I overcame the Goblin legacy, I should be able to control a simple alien symbiote.\\" It looks as if Normie wishes to use the symbiote to be a hero. However, he is apparently afraid of a repeat of what happened on what was supposed to be his wedding day. He told his secretary Kristy Watson (Normie's nanny growing up, cousin of MJ), that if the alien ever takes control of him again, to have Spider-Girl destroy him. His superhero persona does not have a name yet. They object to being referred to as Venom (because Venom was the symbiote with Eddie Brock) or as Normie (he would like to keep his identity secret) while out patrolling but \\"all the good ones [names] are already taken.\\" For a time he considered using the name Dusk. When in control of the symbiote, Normie resembles Spider-Man's black costume with four additional arms. When the Avengers came to arrest him for harboring the Venom symbiote, the cyborgized Jim Rhodes short-circuited (claiming that Tony Stark murdered him) and went on a rampage in New York City. In the end, Normie with the Venom symbiote saved the day because he was the only one who did not hold back—he snared Rhodes with the symbiote and then grabbed onto a live wire from inside a streetlight, electrocuting both himself and Rhodes, with the short-circuiting Rhodes falling first. Afterwards, he informed them that Raptor is a government agent and so \\"surrendered\\" to her custody. He voluntarily joined Kaine's team of reformed supervillains on the condition that Raptor (who does not get along with Whedon, its director) may be allowed to quit. When Brenda is viciously wounded in an attack by the Hobgoblin, he joins Spider-Girl in the hunt for the Hobgoblin. They discover that the Hobgoblin's entire purpose is to lure Spider-Girl to a group of assassins known as the Scriers, and Spider-Girl is impaled by one of their swords. Osborn and the symbiote lash out, killing several of the Scriers with symbiote-constructed blades, causing the Scriers to momentarily retreat (this momentarily lapse would become his and Kaine's little secret). Then, Normie with the symbiote saves Spider-Girl when Osborn transfers the symbiote to her. It heals her wounds and removed the blade's poison from her system. While Spider-Girl with the symbiote go on to hunt down Hobgoblin, Kaine and Normie are besieged by more Scriers. They are later joined by Spider-Girl and Peter Parker (back in costume). The battle is halted however when the Scriers are called off by the Black Tarantula, who had just assumed control of their organization. The symbiote had been vulnerable when Peter Parker rejected it, and it was corrupted by the hate and anger of the second host (Eddie Brock). When it bonded to Normie Osborn, it was changed by his loving nature. When the symbiote gives its life to protect Spider-Girl and her father from the Hobgoblin, Normie felt it die. Normie and Brenda return, and Normie agrees to fund an operation to restore most of the hearing of May's baby brother, Benjamin Parker.Amazing Spider-Girl #15 Normie summons Peter to an old Oscorp warehouse, and reveals a girl in a tank, discovered during his travels abroad, and says that SHE may be the real May Parker. In the next issue, Normie shows Peter his grandfather's journal, which states that he kidnapped May and arranged to have a clone of her returned to the Parkers. With the veracity of the journal in question, Normie and Peter attempt to discover the truth without informing May of their discovery and its possible implications. Normie visits Élan DeJunae and questions her without success; although her body language at the mention of \\"Project: Changeling\\" implies that she knows something, she is unwilling to talk. Later on at the warehouse, Peter (with Normie present) draws some fluid from the tank in order to run some tests on it. Peter realizes too late that the fluid has become unstable from exposure to air—it explodes in his face to Normie's distress.Amazing Spider-Girl #20 The girl is later awoken by a recently escaped Fury, and assaults Normie before making her escape. Appearance/tattoos While he was the Green Goblin, Normie got several tattoos. The tattoo on his back read \\"Honor Thy Father/Kill the Spider.\\" The tattoo on his chest read \\"Revenge\\" and has a spider impaled with a knife. He also had scars on his wrists from his suicide attempt. The Venom symbiote removed all of his tattoos and scars as it died, as a parting gift. =Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows= In the pages of Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows, Normie inherits the entire Oscorp company sometime after Harry's death at ten years old and takes on the name Norman Osborn II. Despite his age, he is a cold, calculating, and relentless CEO similar to his grandfather. When the Spider Family makes their debut, he becomes fascinated with the youngest member of the group, Spiderling. Due to Liz being in charge of Allan Biotech, he is taken care of by his personal assistant, Miss January, who reports to Liz about Normie's behavior. Despite no longer being close to him, Liz attempts to make sure Normie doesn't follow the same path as his father and grandfather. However, blaming the death of his father on Spider-Man, Normie constructs a giant Green Goblin Mech to take Peter Parker and his family down. It is later revealed that Normie was manipulated by Miss January, who pilots the Goblin Mech and coerced Normie into building it to avenge Harry. Normie assists Spiderling in destroying the mech from the inside. He thanks Spiderling for helping him gain his life back.Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows Vol 2. #1 After the incident, Spiderling becomes his first close friend, but as they grew up they saw each other less as Normie's life did get better and more normal despite him still running the company. Eight years later, he takes a more cautious approach for his latest experiments with gene therapy to avoid the incidents caused by his father and grandfather, though he is still a target of enemies as a result of their legacy (though Spiderling does assist in protecting him time to time). He is determined to make the world a better place to redeem the Osborn name, but is unaware that his lead scientist is secretly Mister Sinister, who uses his resources to create various clones of the Spider family to attack the X-Men. Normie uses a smaller version of the Goblin mech to assist the Spider Family and the X-Men in defeating Mr. Sinister, but his exposure to Sinister's chemicals causes him to grow an additional four arms.Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows Vol 2. #23 References External links *Normie's profile 616  Comics characters introduced in 1985 Fictional businesspeople Fictional characters from New York City Marvel Comics 2 Spider-Man characters ","title":"Normie Osborn"},{"id":"5724752","text":"Cooper's Camp is a notified area in Nadia district under Ranaghat police station of Ranaghat subdivision in the state of West Bengal, India.

CPFR seeks cooperative management of inventory through joint visibility and replenishment of products throughout the supply chain. Information shared between suppliers and retailers aids in planning and satisfying customer demands through a supportive system of shared information. This allows for continuous updating of inventory and upcoming requirements, making the end-to-end supply chain process more efficient. Efficiency is created through the decrease expenditures for merchandising, inventory, logistics, and transportation across all trading partners. CFPR is a trademark of GS1 US.GS1 US and Voluntary Interindustry Commerce Solutions Association to Merge, September 10, 2012  Origins CPFR began as a 1995 initiative co-led by Wal-Mart's Vice President of Supply Chain, Chief Information Officer, Vice President of Application Development, and the Cambridge, Massachusetts software and strategy firm, Benchmarking Partners. The Open Source initiative was originally called CFAR (pronounced See-Far, for Collaborative Forecasting and Replenishment). According to an October 21, 1996 Business Week article entitled Clearing the Cobwebs from the Stockroom, New Internet software may make forecasting a snap, \\"Benchmarking developed CFAR with funding from Wal- Mart, IBM, SAP, and Manugistics. The latter two are makers of accounting and supply chain management software, respectively. To promote CFAR as a standard, Benchmarking has posted specifications on the Web and briefed more than 250 companies, including Sears, J.C. Penney, and Gillette. About 20 companies are implementing CFAR.\\" Warner Lambert (now part of Pfizer) served as the first pilot for CFAR. The pilot's results were publicly announced at a CFAR industry session at Harvard University, July 30, 1996 of executives from Wal-Mart's suppliers as well as other retailers and the Uniform Code Council. Benchmarking Partners then presented CFAR to the Board of Directors of the Voluntary Interindustry Commerce Standards Committee (VICS). VICS established an industry committee to prepare for rolling CFAR out as an international standard. The original committee was co-chaired by the Vice President of Customer Marketing from Nabisco and the Vice President of Supply chain from Wal-Mart. Based on the suggestion of Procter & Gamble's Vice President of Supply Chain, the standard was renamed CPFR to emphasize the role of planning in the collaboration. The first publication of the VICS CPFR Voluntary Guidelines came out in 1998. Currently there are committees \\"to develop business guidelines and roadmaps for various collaborative scenarios, which include upstream suppliers, suppliers of finished goods and retailers, which integrate demand and supply planning and execution. The committee is continuing to improve the existing guidelines, tools and critical first steps that enable the implementation of CPFR.\\" These committees gained experience from pilot studies which have occurred over the past six years. VICS continues to lead much of the research and implementation of CPFR through its guidelines and project investigations.  CPFR model  CPFR was originally presented by VICS in their VICS CPFR Guidelines in 1998 as a nine-step (or data flow) process, starting with the collaborating businesses developing the agreement for collaboration. The nine steps were: # Develop Front End Agreement # Create the Joint Business Plan # Create the Sales Forecast # Identify Exceptions for Sales Forecast # Resolve/Collaborate on Exception Items # Create Order Forecast # Identify Exceptions for Order Forecast # Resolve/Collaborate on Exception Items # Order Generation The CPFR model presents the aspects in which industries focus. The model provides a basic framework for the flow of information, goods, and services. In the retail industry the “retailer typically fills the buyer role, a manufacturer fills the seller role, and the consumer is the end customer.” The center of the model is represented as the consumer, followed by the middle ring of the retailer, and finally the outside ring being the manufacturer. Each ring of the model represents different functions within the CPFR model. The consumer drives demand for goods and services while the retailer is the provider of goods and services. The manufacturer supplies the retailer stores with product as demand for product is pulled through the supply chain by the end user, being the consumer.

It operated air taxi and executive charter services, as well as scheduled services. Its main base was Calgary International Airport. The airline shut down operations on June 18, 2009. History The genesis of Corpac Canada was in the early 1970s with Gord Peariso establishing Peariso Aviation, as an aircraft maintenance and parts supplier. His first-class maintenance facility serviced over 30 major oil companies operating their own aircraft in western Canada. In the mid-1980s Peariso Aviation acquired Corpac Canada Ltd., which represented the Piper Aircraft Corporation and sold the Piper Cheyenne turboprop aircraft across Canada. Corpac Canada eventually acquired an aircraft and diversified into the aircraft charter business. In 1991 Corporate Express Business and Charter Airline established the first corporate shuttle service in Western Canada operating between Calgary and Edmonton for the TELUS Corporation (then AGT) using the 18 passenger British Aerospace Jetstream 32. Over the course of the next 10 years, Corporate Express Business and Charter Airline at times included several scheduled shuttle routes and charters, as determined by customer demand for these services. It was with the customer in mind that the SAAB 340 Airliner was acquired in the year 2000. This 30 passenger aircraft marked the millennium for Corporate Express and once again raised the standard for corporate shuttle services and charters within Western Canada. The airline merged with Avia Aviation, and acquired a fleet of Piaggio P180 Avanti aircraft in December 2005. In October 2006, an additional Saab 340 aircraft, that had been acquired earlier that year, enabled a number of new scheduled service routes to be added. These included Dawson Creek, British Columbia, Edmonton and Grande Prairie, Alberta. Destinations Corporate Express operated a shuttle service between Calgary and Fort McMurray, and services from both Calgary and Fort McMurray to southern and northern Alberta on behalf of oil companies. Corporate Express operated a scheduled air service between Calgary and Fort McMurray, Alberta.

Background Chikmaglur Mohan was a pediatrician in North Bay, Ontario. He was charged with sexual assault of four teenage patients. During his trial, the defence tried to put Dr. Hill, a psychiatrist, on the stand as an expert on sexual assault. Hill intended to testify that the perpetrator of the offence must have possessed several abnormal characteristics, which Mohan did not have. In a voir dire hearing, Hill testified that the culprit in the first three assaults was likely a pedophile, while the fourth assault would have been by a sexual psychopath. This evidence was held to be inadmissible by the judge. Mohan was eventually convicted at trial but his conviction was overturned on appeal. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether Hill's testimony could be admitted as that of an expert witness, and whether the testimony would violate the rule against character evidence. Opinion of the Court Justice Sopinka, for a unanimous Court, allowed the appeal and held that the evidence should be excluded. Expert evidence, stated Sopinka in the ruling, should be admitted based on four criteria: :* It must be relevant, :* must be needed to assist the trier of fact, :* should not trigger any exclusionary rules, and :* must be given by a properly qualified expert. Relevance is a question of law and so is determined by the judge. Where it approaches the \\"ultimate issue\\" of the trial, the standard for inclusion must be stricter. To be considered necessary, the expert evidence must be outside the likely everyday experience of a judge and jury. In that regard, Sopinka stated: In total, the expert evidence should be included where the probative value of the evidence outweighs any prejudicial effect it may cause. In the current case, Sopinka found that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that there was any clear standard for determining the profile of a pedophile or psychopath. Thus, the expert evidence was not considered reliable. Furthermore, the expert's evidence was not sufficiently relevant to be of any help.

Created and introduced by William J. Bell, the role was portrayed by Kristoff St. John from 1991 until St. John's death in 2019. As of 2019, Neil is the longest-running African American character to appear on the series. St. John last appeared as Neil on February 6, 2019. Over the years, Neil's storylines have involved his marriages to Drucilla Winters (Victoria Rowell), as well as his conflict with his half- brother Malcolm Winters (Shemar Moore). Neil's daughter, Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), was involved in a paternity storyline, with Neil and Malcolm as her potential fathers. In 1994, Bill Bell had Malcolm walk into Drucilla's bedroom after she had taken prescription drugs. Fully understanding the drugs she had taken caused her to believe him to be her husband, Malcolm chose to take advantage of the situation leaving Dru pregnant. While both her and Malcolm were unsure of the baby's paternity, Neil believed he was the father. Bell chose not to follow up on this plot point, leaving it unresolved until 2005 when then-Executive Producer, John F. Smith, revealed Malcolm as the father. Neil and Drucilla have shared two marriages and adopted a son, Devon Hamilton (Bryton James). Since Drucilla's presumed death in 2007, Neil has had numerous other romances, including Karen Taylor (Nia Peeples), Sofia Dupre (Julia Pace Mitchell), Leslie Michaelson (Angell Conwell), and Hilary Curtis (Mishael Morgan). St. John's portrayal of Neil has garnered a positive response over the years, awarding him two Daytime Emmy Awards and eight NAACP Image Awards. Character development Lilana Novakovich of the Toronto Star characterized Neil as an \\"over-achiever\\". The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that Neil was \\"a young and restless makeup company executive\\". In 1994, St. John described Neil as \\"the typical overachiever\\", stating he's \\"energetic and striving for the top spot at Jabot Cosmetics. He doesn't really see himself as a ladies' man but rather quite sensual; he's very secure.\\" Neil is known for his pairing with Drucilla Winters (Victoria Rowell). Their romance began in 1991; St. John stated at the time that he wanted the series to \\"take its time as romance blossoms\\" between Neil and Drucilla. Storylines In 1991, rising Jabot Cosmetics executive trainee Neil Winters becomes involved in a love quadrangle with Drucilla Barber (Victoria Rowell), Olivia Barber (Tonya Lee Williams), and Nathan Hastings (Nathan Purdee). Olivia and Nathan are engaged but Olivia's sister Dru wants Nathan for herself. She has Neil attempt to woo Olivia away from Nathan. While doing so, he falls in love with Olivia. Neil and Dru's attempt to break up the couple is unsuccessful. Neil and Dru fall for one another and become romantically involved. They are married in a private ceremony at Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper)'s estate in March 1993. Neil's half-brother Malcolm Winters (Shemar Moore) comes to town in 1994. There is animosity between Malcolm and Neil (now an executive at Newman Enterprises), but Malcolm befriends Dru and soon falls in love with her. While she is over-medicated on cold medicine, they have sex and Dru becomes pregnant. She does not know if Neil or Malcolm is the father. They decide to keep their affair a secret and to allow Neil to raise the baby whether he is the father or not. Neil and Dru's daughter, Lily Winters, is born in 1995. Dru's career as a fashion model caused problems in her marriage to Neil. He wanted her to be a stay at home mom. These problems eventually led to a divorce. Dru and Lily leave Genoa City and Neil for Paris. After Victoria Newman (Heather Tom) becomes pregnant with the baby of Cole Howard, her former husband, she and Neil bond and decide to raise the child together. They plan to marry. Victoria goes into an early labor and gives birth to a premature baby, Eve, who dies shortly after birth. After this they decide to end their engagement. Subsequently, Neil has a relationship with Dru's sister Olivia, and comes very close to having an affair with Malcolm's fiancée Alex Perez (Alexia Robinson). After the murder of his best friend, Ryan McNeil (Scott Reeves), and the apparent death of his brother, Malcolm, Neil also battles alcoholism. Neil eventually manages to get his illness under control, but almost loses his family and career. In 2002, Drucilla and Lily (Christel Khalil), now age 14, return to Genoa City. Dru hopes Neil can help rein in their rebellious daughter. They end up reuniting romantically and remarry in 2003. They become entangled in business issues as he works for Newman Enterprises and she works for Newman's rival, Jabot Cosmetics. They also have to deal with their daughter's troubles as Lily becomes involved with Internet predator and hebophile Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), who infects her with chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease. Neil and Dru meet juvenile delinquent Devon Hamilton (Bryton James) in 2004. Although Neil is initially reluctant, they take him in and become his foster parents. Soon after Devon turns 18, they adopt him. In 2006, Neil and Dru's marriage becomes strained when he finds out Malcolm is Lily's biological father. He separates from Dru and develops romantic feelings for Carmen Mesta (Marisa Ramirez). They fight their feelings and Dru becomes increasingly jealous of their relationship. She breaks into Carmen's hotel room and cuts up her clothes. Carmen has her arrested and presses charges. Neil tries to get her to drop them. When she refuses Neil completely stands behind Dru. It is revealed that Carmen had an affair at her previous job with married executive David Chow (Vincent Irizarry). She sued the man's company for sexual harassment after she was fired by the man's wife. Carmen is eventually killed outside of Neil's new jazz club, Indigo. Devon is wrongfully arrested for her murder, but he is soon exonerated. In April 2007, Dru and her best friend Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) attend a cliff-side photo shoot for NVP. After an argument with Phyllis Summers, who also attended, Dru and Sharon fall backwards off the cliff. A nearly dead Sharon is later rescued; however, search and rescue personnel only find the remains of Dru's jacket. Her body is never recovered. Neil briefly turns to alcohol once again, but stops when he sees the effect it is having on Lily. Later that year, Neil begins a romantic relationship with Karen Taylor (Nia Peeples). They move in together. Devon is united with his aunt Tyra Hamilton (Eva Marcille) and half-sister Ana Hamilton (Jamia Simone Nash). Tyra develops romantic feelings for Neil but keeps them to herself. Olivia tries to push Tyra and Neil together because Tyra reminds her of her sister Dru. Neil stays with Karen. Tyra raised Ana because her birth mother, Yolanda Hamilton, could not. Yolanda reports Ana missing and Ana is taken away from Tyra. So Ana will not be taken away and given to strangers, Neil and Karen marry and become her foster parents. Karen convinces Neil to take it a step further by adopting Ana. Tyra soon reveals her feelings to Neil, who eventually reciprocates. The two make love, unaware that their tryst was discovered by Devon. Devon confronts him and Neil is horrified when he sees how much he hurt his son. Neil soon admits his infidelity to Karen, who still wants to proceed with Ana's adoption. However, at the adoption hearing Neil tells the judge that Tyra has been and would be the best parent for Ana. Tyra is awarded full and permanent custody of Ana, and a devastated Karen leaves and divorces Neil. With Neil's extramarital affair exposed, he pursues a relationship with Tyra. Soon thereafter, it is revealed that Tyra is not biologically related to Devon or any of the Hamiltons, a secret she kept to protect her chances of gaining custody of Ana. Despite his anger and resentment toward Tyra, Devon finds that he is attracted to her. Following a particularly vicious argument, Devon and Tyra have sex with each other, unaware that his girlfriend Roxanne (Tatyana Ali) has walked in and discovered them in the act. The following day, Roxanne angrily breaks up with Devon, who later admits his indiscretion to a stunned Neil. Tyra leaves town with Ana, and Devon eventually reunites with Roxanne. In April 2009 Neil resigns from Newman Enterprises, recognizing that he would never rise any higher in the family-owned business. The following day, he accepts the position of chief executive officer of Chancellor Industries, the conglomerate owned by Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper). In December, the company is acquired in a hostile takeover by Tucker McCall, who is revealed to be Katherine's long-lost son. Chancellor Industries becomes a subsidiary of Tucker McCall Unlimited. Consequently, Neil begins to work closely with Tucker and with McCall Unlimited's chief financial officer, Sofia Dupre (Julia Pace Mitchell). He is stunned to discover that Sofia is engaged to his brother Malcolm (now Darius McCrary), who has recently returned to Genoa City. In 2010 Neil and Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson) begin dating, after many years of friendship. The couple parts on friendly terms after Neil decides to focus on his children and new grandchildren and readjust his life. In February 2011, Neil's son-in-law Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard) is murdered. The entire Barber/Winters family comes together to support Lily and her twin babies with Cane, Charlie and Matilda. At the time, Sofia is estranged from Malcolm. Impressed with how Sofia has taken great pains to support Lily, Neil allows his deep-seated attraction to Sofia to surface, and the two have sex. In March 2011, Neil testifies in the lawsuit that Victoria, Nicholas and Abby Newman brought against their father and his former boss Victor Newman. Victor's younger son Adam had previously testified that while Victor in Mexico and Adam was in control of Newman Enterprises he forged the Newman trust funds, which was what Victoria, Nick, and Abby based their lawsuit on, thus helping Victor's case. This means that if Adam was the one that committed this crime, that the entire lawsuit could be dismissed. Victor had secretly made Adam testify to this in return for Victor helping Sharon be cleared on criminal charges. Neil testified that it was impossible for Adam to forge the trust funds because Adam did not have access to Victor's private files. Neil's testimony helps win the case for Victoria, Nick, and Abby. The judge order Victor to pay the three each $500 million for a total of $1.5 billion. Neil then finds himself attracted to Leslie Michaelson, the lawyer who represented the Newman children in the lawsuit. The two get a room at the GCAC, but agreed to nothing sexual. Later Michael Baldwin catches the two flirting at the coffee shop. He said that the judge might think that Neil and Leslie have done business under the table. She cleverly responded that the judge would be more concerned about Adam lying under oath. Neil asked Leslie to be his date to Malcolm and Sofia's wedding. At the reception at Glow Worm, Sofia had to rush herself to the bathroom because she felt sick. On their honeymoon, she found out that she is pregnant, but is not sure if Neil or Malcolm is the father. Sofia confides in Dr. Olivia Winters about this. Olivia mathematically concluded that Neil must be the father, but Sofia, who is still in love with Malcolm, is holding on to hope that the father is Malcolm until a DNA test can prove the paternity for sure. Sofia later confesses the entire situation. Malcolm is so hurt that he moves into a hotel room after nearly getting into a fight with Neil. Cane Ashby is revealed to still be alive and that it was his twin Caleb that had died. Cane's father Colin wanted to kidnap the twins and take them to Australia. Colin thought he was being aided by Caleb, but in reality it is Cane that is working against his father. Cane does this by making Lily think that she is slowly losing her mind by appearing as a ghost figment of her imagination. Lily breaks down and commits herself into a mental hospital. Cane was able to stop Colin's plan. He then reveals himself to be alive. Every one is disgusted at Cane for what he did to Lily and let a dangerous man like Colin around the twins knowing Colin would eventually try to kidnap them as soon as he knew he would become a grandfather. Neil is so irate at Cane that he punches Cane and says \\"that was for Lily\\". Cane is now working as a bartender at a bar called Jimmy's and Colin. He was arrested but was set free citing diplomatic immunity. In October 2011, Sofia's baby—named Moses after her father—is born, and DNA testing reveals that Neil is the father. Malcolm leaves Genoa City and promptly divorces Sofia, who moves in with Neil when she and Moses are discharged from the hospital. A month later, Neil and Sofia agree to get married—for the baby's sake. Throughout the time of their marriage, Neil continues to flirt with temptation with Harmony Hamilton, which increases Sofia's insecurities about her marriage to Neil. The pair later decide to divorce as the best interest for Moses. In April 2019, Devon found that Neil had died in his sleep from a stroke. Reception Months into St. John's debut, the Calhoun Times wrote: \\"At Jabot Cosmetics, where he's a junior executive, Neil Winters is just beginning to carve his professional niche.\\" St. John won two Daytime Emmy Awards and eight NAACP Image Awards for his portrayal.

They toured on numerous occasions around both the United States and Europe and had several releases, including 3 full-length LP's, the last of which was released on Revelation Records. Vocalist Brian McTernan was also a member of Ashes, Miltown and My Best Mistake and guitarist Ken Olden also played in Damnation A.D., Better Than A Thousand, Youth of Today, Worlds Collide, When Tigers Fight and Fort Knox. Biography Vocalist Brian McTernan performing in New York City, 1998 Originally entitled \\"Fury\\", the band was established in 1990 and released their first recording as a 7\\" on Deadlock Records in 1991. The record featured Brian McTernan on vocals, Ken Olden and Matt Squire on guitars, Toshi Yano on bass and Zac Eller on drums. The songs from this 7\\" were re-recorded and released as an EP entitled We Won't Fall in 1993 on the German record label Lost & Found. The band, as it states in the liner notes of the EP, then turned into Worlds Collide with Matt Burger becoming the new vocalist. Battery achieved success in Europe, but in the USA were initially only well known in the Washington, D.C. area. The band was reformed with original members Brian McTernan and Ken Olden, along with Ben Chused on bass and Alec Rosenberg on drums, and embarked on their first European tour. They released their first full-length album in 1994, Only the Diehard Remain, on Tidal Records in the USA and on Lost & Found Records in Europe. This album featured a cover of 7 Seconds We're Gonna Fight and featured Ken Olden performing both the guitar and drum tracks. In the same year they released a four song E.P. entitled Let the Past Go as well as a split 7\\" with Ignite, both on Lost & Found Records. In 1996, Jason Hamacher, also a member of Frodus, joined as their new drummer and they released their second full-length album entitled Until the End. This album was released on Conversion Records in the United States and again on Lost & Found Records in Europe and featured another 7 Seconds cover Young Till I Die. Ben Chused then departed to play drums in the Boston hardcore punk band, Ten Yard Fight, and was replaced by Graham Land who had played guitar in Worlds Collide and founded Better Than a Thousand with Ken Olden and Ray Cappo, the singer of Youth of Today. The band then toured the United States with Ten Yard Fight as well as Europe with Damnation A.D. Their third and final album, Whatever It Takes, was released on the major hardcore label Revelation Records in 1998. The drums on this album were, for the first time since We Won't Fall, not performed by Ken Olden, but by Jason Hamacher. They then toured the United States and Europe with Revelation Records labelmates, Better Than a Thousand, In My Eyes and Speak 714 and shortly disbanded after this. A compilation CD was released in 2002 entitled Final Fury: 1990-1997 on the Spanish hardcore label Soul Force and the band briefly re-formed in 2012 for the Revelation Records 25th anniversary shows in New York City In 2017, the band released the song \\"My Last Breath\\" which was followed by a compilation album called For the Rejected by the Rejected and a European tour in fall.

It is an important form of cultural assimilation. Religious assimilation includes the religious conversion of individuals from a minority faith to the dominant faith. It can also include the religious indoctrination of children into a dominant religion by their converted parents. However, religious assimilation need not involve wholesale adoption of a dominant religious belief system by a minority; the concept is broad enough to include alterations in the frequency of religious participation to match that of the dominant culture. Indeed, religious assimilation among immigrant groups most commonly involves such minor changes, rather than sweeping change in religious belief systems. In sharp contrast to other aspects of cultural assimilation such as language and nationality, dominant cultures in general tend not to expect immigrants to adopt the dominant religion. Some researchers, such as Will Herberg, have advanced a thesis of perpetual religious pluralism, to the effect that immigrants would typically retain their religious affiliation even after complete cultural assimilation in other aspects of culture. Nevertheless, some dominant cultures may exert pressures for religious assimilation so extreme as to amount, according to some researchers, to a form of religious persecution. These pressures may be exerted by making other, more appealing forms of cultural assimilation, such as membership in secular social club activities, so time-consuming that they interfere seriously with attendance at minority religious services, and by discouraging expression of minority religious beliefs in public.

Before the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, it was known as the Enemy Property Act. It is now called the Vested Property Act – 2013. The act was criticized as a tool for appropriating the lands of the Hindu population who went to India from 1965 to 1969. Background =Legal history= This law is the culmination of several successive discriminatory laws against non- Muslims passed while Bangladesh was part of Pakistan. Chronologically, they are: * The East Bengal (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act (XIII of 1948) * The East Bengal Evacuees (Administration of Property) Act (VIII of 1949) * The East Bengal Evacuees (Restoration of Possession) Act (XXII of 1951) * The East Bengal Evacuees (Administration of Immovable Property) Act (XXIV of 1951) * The East Bengal Prevention of Transfer of Property and Removal of Documents and Records Act of 1952 * The Pakistan (Administration of Evacuees Property) Act (XII of 1957) * The East Pakistan Disturbed Persons (Rehabilitation) Ordinance (No 1 of 1964) * The Defence of Pakistan Ordinance (No. XXIII of 6 September 1965) * The Defence of Pakistan Rules of 1965 * The Enemy Property (Custody and Registration) Order of 1965 * The East Pakistan Enemy Property (Lands and Buildings Administration and Disposal Order of 1966). * The Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provision) Ordinance No. 1 of 1969 * Bangladesh (Vesting of Property and Assets) President's (Order No. 29 of 1972). * The Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provisions) (Repeal) Act (XLV of 1974) * The Vested and Non-Resident Property (Administration) Act (XLVI of 1974) * The vested and Non-Resident (Administration) (Repeal) Ordinance 1976 The Ordinance, (No. XCII of 1976). * The Ordinance No. XCIII of 1976. On 6 November 2008, the High Court division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh delivered its rule nisi upon the government on the Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provision) (Repeal) Act 1974 and subsequently promulgated Arpita Sampatty Protapyan Ain 2001 and circulars, administrative orders. The order calls upon the respondent to show cause as to why instructions issued in the contents of presidential order 29 of 1972, act 45 and 46 of 1974, ordinance No. 92, 93 of 1976, Arpita Sampatty Protapyan Ain 2001 and circulars issued by government that are in contradiction with the fundamental rights and the charter of declaration of Independence of Bangladesh, 10 April 1971, should not be declared to be ultra vires the constitution. The Rule Nisi also stated why the properties so far incorporated in the list as Enemy (Vested) should not be returned to the title holder/successor/legal possession holders and or such other or further order or orders passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper. The Rule is made returnable within 4 weeks from 28 October 2008. =Renamed as Vested Property Act= Though renamed as the Vested Property Act in 1974, the law still retains the fundamental ability to deprive a Bangladeshi citizen of property simply by declaration of that person as an enemy of the state. Leaving the country through abandonment is cited as the most common reason for this, and it is frequently the case that Hindu families who have one or several members leaving the country (due to religious atrocities against Hindus, and economic as well as political reasons) have their entire property confiscated due to labeling as enemy. Measurable impact =Newspaper reports= The Bangladeshi newspaper The Sangbad (21 March 1977) reported that at that point in time, according to the government's own figures, 702,335 acres (2,842 km²) of cultivable land and 22,835 homes were listed as enemy property. =Prominent cases= Much of the property of murdered Hindu politician Dhirendranath Datta was confiscated by the Bangladesh government after independence in 1971 . Because Datta's body was never found after he was arrested by the Pakistan Army during the Bangladesh Liberation War, an affidavit was brought forward that it could not be concluded that Datta had not voluntarily left the country. The family property of Nobel Prize–winning economist Amartya Sen had been confiscated by the Pakistan government. In 1999, the Bangladesh government announced that it was investigating opportunities to return the property to Sen's family. =Barkat's seminal work= A seminal book by Professor Abul Barkat of Dhaka University, Inquiry into Causes and Consequences of Deprivation of Hindu Minorities in Bangladesh through the Vested Property Act, was published in 2000. It demonstrated that 925,050 Hindu households (40% of Hindu families in Bangladesh) have been affected by the Enemy Property Act. This included 748,850 families dispossessed of agricultural land. The total amount of land lost by Hindu households as a result of this discriminatory act was estimated at 1.64 million acres (6,640 km²), which is equivalent to 53 per cent of the total land owned by the Hindu community and 5.3 per cent of the total land area of Bangladesh. The survey also showed that the beneficiaries of the land grab through the act cut across all party lines. The political affiliation of direct beneficiaries of appropriated property was: * Bangladesh Awami League 44.2% * Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) 31.7% * Jatiya Party 5.8% * Jamaat- e-Islami 4.8% * Others 13.5% The greatest appropriation of Hindu property took place immediately after independence during the first Awami League government (1972–75) and during the first period of rule of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (1976-1980). Barkat's work also showed that since 1948, 75% of the land of religious minorities in East Pakistan and subsequent Bangladesh had been confiscated through provisions of the act. Barkat also emphasized that less than 0.4% of the population of Bangladesh has benefited from the Enemy Property Act, demonstrating that this law has been abused by those in power through corruption, with no demonstrated sanction by the population at large. =Effect on Bangladeshi demographics= The law in its implementation has been seen as a major driver behind the reduction of the Bangladeshi Hindu population, which has declined from an estimated 30% in 1947,http://hinduism.about.com/od/history/a/humanrights.htm to 17% in 1965 to 16% today, representing a loss of around 11 million people. Most of this population left for India, while the more affluent Bangladeshi Hindus leaving due to the act have moved to USA, Canada, Europe and Australia. Repeal of the act During Bangladesh's first three decades of independence many politicians made empty promised to repeal the act. The first government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman vowed to repeal any laws that contradicted the values of the newly liberated country; the Enemy Property Act contravened non-communal provisions of the new constitution. But instead of being repealed it was sustained under a new name in 1974. Finally in the run up to the 2001 election Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League succeeded in a drive to repeal the act.International Religious Freedom Report 2002: Bangladesh, US Department of State The Vested Properties Return Act (2001) was implemented (in a session boycotted by the opposition BNP and Jamaat members) in an effort to make amends for the confiscated property. However little progress has been made in returning or compensating lost property under the Khaleda Zia government from 2001–2006. In 2008, [HRCBM (Human Rights Congress for Bangladesh Minorities)] filed a writ before Bangladesh Supreme Court under article 102 of the constitution.WRIT PETITION NO. 6092 OF 2008, HRCBM (2008) International concern Congressman Crowley of the Bangladesh-American caucus has called for the repeal of the act , as have several Bangladeshi politicians and human rights activists. The current opposition Awami League has vowed to repeal the act if returned to power in the next elections, even though it has yet to acknowledge its own participation in implementation of the act during the 1972-75 period. An international conference organized by several Hindu activist groups held in London on 16 June 2005 was addressed by, among others, Lord Avebury of the British House of Lords and called for repeal of the act. The law has been highlighted by the U.S. Department of State and Amnesty International as a major human rights concern that has contributed to internal displacement, emigration and disenfranchisement.

These were (in addition to the Volcanic or Quaternary) as follows: the Primary series, which consisted of schists from the core of the mountains; the Secondary, which consisted of the hard sedimentary rocks on the mountain flanks; and the Tertiary, which consisted of the less hardened sedimentary rocks of the foothills. Because this arrangement did not always hold true for mountain ranges other than the Alps, the Primary and the Secondary were dropped in the general case. However the term 'Tertiary' has persisted in geological literature until its recent replacement by the Palaeogene and Neogene periods. The last period of the Cenozoic Era, known as the Pleistocene Epoch, is sometimes not included in the notion of the Tertiary. The Cenozoic was studied and further determined by, among others, the English geologist (and mentor of Charles Darwin) Charles Lyell. Giovanni Arduino died in Venice in 1795.

In 1984 he was honored with a Drama Desk Special Award for serving a wide range of playwrights. He directed the 1956 American premiere of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, Edward Albee's Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and Tiny Alice; the American première of Joe Orton's Entertaining Mr Sloane, Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party, as well as Pinter's The Dumb Waiter, The Collection, and a trilogy of Pinter's plays under the title Other Places (including One for the Road, Family Voices, and A Kind of Alaska); Bertolt Brecht's The Caucasian Chalk Circle; You Know I Can't Hear You When the Water's Running; and Michael Weller's Moonchildren and Loose Ends. Schneider also directed Samuel Beckett's only direct foray into the world of film, entitled Film. The short subject starred Buster Keaton and its direction is often misattributed to Samuel Beckett himself, notably during an exhibit at the Louvre in November 2006. \\"Film\\" is a silent exploration of Bishop Berkeley's principle 'esse est percipi' (to be is to be perceived). One of a select group of non-actors awarded membership in The Actors Studio, Schneider taught at Catholic University, City College of the City University of New York, The Juilliard School (where he was director of the theatre program), the University of California, Riverside, and the University of California, San Diego, whose library maintains an archive of his papers. He was associated with Arena Stage for 30 years. He was also the co-artistic director of The Acting Company. At the time of his death, he served as president of the board of directors for Theatre Communications Group (TCG). Samuel Beckett and Schneider's death During his lifetime, Schneider was a leading director of Samuel Beckett's plays, and there was a Beckettian element in Schneider's death. While in London, Schneider attempted to cross a street in order to mail a letter to Beckett's address in Paris. Stepping off the pavement, the (Russian-born) American director looked to the left for oncoming traffic, momentarily forgetting that motor vehicles in Britain travel on the left side of the road. He was struck and killed by an oncoming motorcycle. At the time of his accidental death, Schneider was taking a break from directing Other Places, a trilogy of plays by Harold Pinter. It was reaching the end of its run in New York City, and the theatre lobby featured his obituary in its last week of performances. Alan Schneider memorial fund Following his death, the Alan Schneider Memorial Fund was established by TCG, The Acting Company, and the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society. Proceeds from the Fund go to the Alan Schneider Director Award, which provides national visibility to the recipient as well as a grant to support activities specifically tied to the development of the craft of directing.

This option is listed along with the names of individuals running for the position and is often described as \\"none of the above\\". The option first appeared on the Nevada ballot in 1975. In the event that the \\"None of These Candidates\\" option receives the most votes in an election, the actual candidate who receives the most votes still wins the election. This has most notably happened on two occasions: in the 1976 Republican primary for Nevada's At-large congressional district, None of These Candidates received 16,097 votes, while Walden Earhart won 9,831 votes, followed by Dart Anthony with 8,097 votes. Even though he received fewer votes than \\"None of These Candidates\\", Earhart received the Republican nomination. He went on to lose to incumbent Democratic Congressman Jim Santini in the general election. In the 2014 Democratic gubernatorial primary, \\"None of These Candidates\\" won 30% of the popular vote, a plurality. Robert Goodman, the runner-up with 25% of the vote, was the Democratic nominee by state law.Smith, Alexander. \\"Nevada Democrats Chose 'None of These Candidates' in Primary – NBC News.\\" NBC News. N.p., n.d. Web. 11 June 2014. .  Notable impact on elections  According to a report by then-Secretary of State Dean Heller, \\"None of These Candidates\\" has finished first on three other occasions: in a 1978 Republican congressional primary, a 1978 Republican Secretary of State primary and a 1986 Democratic Treasurer primary. Additionally, it happened again in the 2014 Democratic gubernatorial primary making it a grand total of five instances. The \\"None of These Candidates\\" option has possibly played a spoiler effect in close races, such as in the 1998 U.S. Senate election, in which Democratic incumbent Sen. Harry Reid defeated Republican challenger John Ensign by only 428 votes, while None of These Candidates drew 8,125 votes. Court challenge In June 2012, anticipating a close race in Nevada during the 2012 presidential elections, the Republican National Committee challenged the constitutionality of the option. Fearing that the option would siphon votes from the Republican nominee, the RNC claimed that the option is not constitutional because if \\"None of these Candidates\\" received the most votes, it would not win the election. The Nevada Attorney General, on behalf of the Secretary of State of Nevada, argued that the option is a protest vote intended to send a message and whose outcome is no different from not voting at all. On August 22, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Jones agreed with the plaintiffs and struck down the law allowing the option as unconstitutional. He refused to issue a stay pending the outcome of an appeal, meaning the ban on this option would be immediate. On September 4, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued an emergency stay against the district court's order. The emergency stay barred the implementation of Judge Jones's injunction until the Ninth Circuit could hear an appeal, allowing the \\"none of these candidates\\" option to remain on the ballot in the November 2012 elections. On July 10, 2013, the Court of Appeals threw out the lawsuit, preserving the \\"none of these candidates\\" option. One member of that panel, Judge Stephen Reinhardt, criticized Jones' handling of the case: \\"His dilatory tactics appear to serve no purpose other than to seek to prevent the state from taking an appeal of his decision before it prints the ballots....

Dynablock A pair of Easynet floppy discs Dynablock is a name which was used by Easynet from 2001 to 2003 for their Dialup Users List DNSBL of Internet addresses that appeared to be assigned dynamically, i.e. to dialup and residential broadband users. Updates of Dynablock stopped December 2003 but it became the basis for NJABL and SORBS own dynamic IP lists. The dynamic list parts of NJABL and SORBS have been developed independently since then, with NJABL using the 'dynablock' name for their list. In early 2007, NJABL passed their data along to The Spamhaus Project, for using in their PBL service. Banned Advertising Campaign Banned Easynet advert - Dec 2002 In 2002, a campaign created by HHCL for Easynet's broadband services showed both male and female bosses punching their employees for wasting company money, and employees punching their bosses for slow internet speeds. One of the advertisements which appeared in the London Evening Standard, showed a man being punched in the face by his male boss, with the slogan: \\"When your MD finds out you're spending up to 85% too much on your internet connection\\". A second advertisement showed an image of a woman punching a man in the face with the slogan: \\"When your employees discover that their internet connection could be 140 times faster\\". The Advertising Standards Authority banned these adverts ruling that they could cause serious or widespread offence, and that they condoned violence and anti-social behavior.

Geography Location Mittenaar lies in the Lahn-Dill Highland. =Municipal area's extent= On Mittenaar's 3 518 ha live more than 5,000 people. About 45 km of roads connect the various centres. More than half the municipal area is wooded. =Neighbouring communities= Mittenaar borders in the north on the community of Siegbach, in the northeast on the community of Bischoffen, in the east on the community of Hohenahr, in the southeast on the town of Aßlar, in the south on the community of Ehringshausen, in the southwest on the community of Sinn, and in the west on the town of Herborn (all in the Lahn-Dill-Kreis). =Constituent communities= The community consists of the centres of Ballersbach, Bellersdorf, Bicken (administrative seat) and Offenbach. History =Mittenaar= The community of Mittenaar came into being on 1 January 1972 with the merger of the formerly independent municipalities of Ballersbach, Bicken and Offenbach. Bellersdorf was amalgamated on 1 April 1972. =Ballersbach= Ballersbach had its first documentary mention in 1270. The Ballersbach Church (Capelle zu Ballersbach) was also most likely built in this time. That the chapel had some special importance can clearly be seen in the much bigger village of Seelbach being placed under it. Ballersbach grew together over time from two centres, one around the Baalerstaa (Balder- or Baldurstein; \\"Baldur Stone\\") and the other to the south. About 1500, the church was painted with wonderful frescoes that eventually disappeared over time. In the Thirty Years' War, the village was stricken with the then incurable Plague, which took 165 lives. In this dreadful time, only 85 villagers survived. It was more than one hundred years before Ballersbach recovered from this catastrophe. In 1912 the church was heavily damaged when it was struck by lightning. As the church was being renovated, however, the frescoes came back to light. The pictures show, symbolically, mankind's history and Christianity's beginnings in a series of individual pictures. In 1993, there was an extensive renovation of these artworks to ensure their continued existence for posterity. =Bellersdorf= Bellersdorf had its first documentary mention in 1294. For unknown reasons, the village was abandoned for about 200 years (about 1500-1699). It can only be assumed that the Plague struck here, too, or that war forced the villagers to flee. Only in 1699 did some families settle in Bellersdorf again, with Count Ludwig von Hohensolms's permission. Only after the Second World War, when improved transport connections eliminated the village's remote location as a problem did a great upswing begin. By participating in the contest \\"Unser Dorf soll schöner werden\\" (\\"Our village should become nicer\\"), Bellersdorf became known nationally. The advantageous location, the quiet and the lack of through traffic have made Bellersdorf into the constituent community with the highest quality of living. =Bicken= Bicken's coat of arms (as of 1952) Bicken had its first documentary mention in a Cologne document in 1218. The village is, however, likely much older, as a castle from Frankish times reportedly once stood in Bicken. The nobles of Bicken and Dernbach were subject to the Count of Nassau in the struggle for ascendancy in the Herborner Mark. As a result, various rights and estates had to be sold to the Nassauers. Bicken's advantageous location (with connections to several long-distance roads) had both an upside and a downside in earlier times, leading time and again to uninvited visits by soldiers in the Thirty Years' War, whereby many lost belongings and even lives. In Napoleonic times, Bicken was made the hub of the Ballersbach-Bicken-Offenbach-Herbornseelbach area. During both world wars, Bicken suffered great losses. In the First World War, 27 soldiers from Bicken died, and in the Second World War, 78. Bicken's coat of arms The village of Bicken bore no coat of arms in earlier times, and used no seal. The community was granted leave to bear a coat of arms in 1952. It might heraldically be described thus: In sable two bars argent. It is based on the old noble family's arms, who owned the village as vassals of the Counts of Nassau from 1327 to 1732. The arms have become part of Mittenaar's civic coat of arms. =Offenbach= Offenbach had its first documentary mention in one of Johann von Dernbach's documents. In the dreadful years of the Thirty Years' War, Imperial General Philipp von Mansfeld's hordes overran the villages in the Aar Valley setting houses ablaze. In Offenbach, 60 burnt down, in Bicken 53 and in Ballersbach 18 buildings. Also unforgotten is a grim chapter in this great war, the persecution of witches. In 1629 and 1630, thirty men and women (6 from Offenbach, 18 from Bicken and 6 from Ballersbach) were burnt at the stake by their own fellow villagers. As for the oldest cultural monument, the tower at the Offenbach Church houses a bell from the year 1452, which has been in use uninterruptedly since then. The burgeoning population in 1955-1956 made church nave expansion necessary. =Coat of arms= Mittenaar's civic coat of arms might heraldically be described thus: In sable a bend wavy sinister Or, above, a trefoil Or, below, two bars argent. The arms show besides a wavy fess as a symbol for the Aar, which flows through the community, two charges of former noble families who held sway in what is now the municipal area: the cloverleaf for the Lords of Dernbach and, as mentioned earlier, the two bars of the Lords of Bicken. Culture =Music= The youth choir \\"Young Voices Mittenaar\\" was brought together in January 2000 on an initiative by 3 choirs: MGV 1861 Ballersbach, GV Sängervereinigung 1860 Bicken and GV Eintracht Offenbach. The repertoire includes spirituals, gospels, evergreens and modern pieces (for example Dancing Queen, Y.M.C.A, Wade in the water, Bridge over troubled water, and so on). =Regular events= * Haahepper (Friday and Saturday in July) Notable people * Johann Heinrich Alsted (born mid-March 1588 in Ballersbach, died 9 November 1638 in Weißenburg (nowadays Alba Iulia), Romania), was a reformed theologian and polymath.

Reischauer of Harvard University under the title Ennin's Diary: The Record of a Pilgrimage to China in Search of the Law (Ronald Press, New York: 1955) and Ennin's Travels in T'ang China. The first volume is a translation of Ennin’s Diary. The second volume, a discussion of Ennin's travels, includes materials from other sources. Ennin's travel books are precious as historical sources, although they have some errors. His book was the first written document about China and its life by a foreigner. He did not write an evaluation of what he saw, but rather wrote about religious matters and Chinese life under the Tang Dynasty. His diary is a good source on the practice of popular Buddhism in China. He described ceremonies as well. He brought back many sutras and mandalas to Japan. He struggled in his travel during the Tang’s persecution of Buddhism (842-846). Another contribution on his books was about Korea, which records details of Korea's active trade with Northeastern China. Korea had a dominant role in trade between East China, Korea, and Japan.

It is the second most important commercial city in North Bengal. History Dalkhola was originally in the state of Bihar in India. After 1959, Dalkhola was located in the state of West Bengal. The town expanded around the Dalkhola village Panchayats and developed into an important centre for trade and commerce due to mainstream connection with both Railway and Roadway. It is an important center for commodities like jute, corn and oil trade in Uttar Dinajpur. It is also an important center for the trade of maize, which is produced in the neighboring state of Bihar. Before the Independence of India in 1947 and later, the figure of Dalkhola was idly rural area where some Pucca and Kacha roads were connected to nearest place. The area was covered by jungle in large, only a few area was used for living. Their main source of income was agriculture and fishery from Mahananda. That time it was ruled by Raja P.C.Lal. After Independence & partition of India, innumerable refugees came to Dalkhola from Bangladesh formerly known as East Pakistan & they live in Dalkhola rural area. Before in 1956, this area belong to the state of Bihar under Purnia district. In 1956 this area was transferred to Territory of West Bengal by endeavour of Chief Minister Dr. B.C. Roy. It is an important place in this spare of communication facility as NH 12 and NH 27 pass through this locality. Small villages are administered by Panchayat Raj, & they gradually develop into work-oriented busy market & that gradually convert into Small Township. With the growth of population and economic base establishment, the people of Dalkhola experienced a green revolution. In consequence, Dalkhola Municipality was set up on 1 January 2003 for upliftment of social and economic development. Politics Dalkhola became a municipality in 2003. In the Dalkhola municipal area, there were 14 Wards. But now 2 more ward are divided now there are 16 wards. In last election, the Indian National Congress won 9 seats out of 14, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) won the other 5 seats. It is one of the four municipalities in North Dinajpur district. Dalkhola has 16 now. in Recently 2013 Municipality election Congress won 10 seats, cpim 4 and Tmc 2. Now whole councillors of congress party joined Trinamool Congress nd now the status are TMC 12, CPIM 4 and CONG 0 Geography Geographical map of Dalkhola Dalkhola has an average elevation of 23 meters (75 feet) and is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Dalkhola In the map alongside, all places marked on the map are linked in the full screen version. It is the second-largest area in the Uttar Dinajpur district, with a length 13 km from East to West, 18 km from North to South. Dalkhola was divided on the 14 wards. But now to more wards are added, 9 number ward divided into 9 and 16 and 11 number ward divided into 11 and 15. The following 16 ward are: * Muhammad Pur * Hari Pur * Bhusamani * Mithapur * Malickpur More * Deshbandhu Para * Dalkhola Bazar * High School Para * Dalkhola Basti * Subhash Pally * Farsara * Bidhan Pally * Uttar Dalkhola * Purnia More * Shikar Pur * Nichit Pur * Binoy colony * Shree pally * Vivekananda pally * Hatbari * College para * College more * High school more Climate The cooler months in Dalkhola begin in December and end in February. The temperature generally peaks at about 35 °C. The annual low temperature is usually near 10 °C. The monsoon season starts in June and runs through September. Development Super market Dalkhola Dalkhola library Dalkhola is the largest exporter of Maize in West Bengal. In Dalkhola, a national level Power Grid was established in 1973, which expanded the availability of electricity to the Municipality. Other developments include a Flour Mill, Tantia agro chemical Pvt Ltd and maize processing company which use the crops produced by local farmers. Official languages As per the West Bengal Official Language (Amendment) Act, 2012, which came into force from December 2012, Urdu was given the status of official language in areas, such as subdivisions and blocks, having more than 10% Urdu speaking population. In Uttar Dinajpur district, Goalpokhar I and II blocks, Islampur block and Islampur municipality were identified as fulfilling the norms set In 2014, Calcutta High Court, in an order, included Dalkhola municipality in the list.

SQ-universality can be thought of as a measure of largeness or complexity of a group. History Many classic results of combinatorial group theory, going back to 1949, are now interpreted as saying that a particular group or class of groups is (are) SQ-universal. However the first explicit use of the term seems to be in an address given by Peter Neumann to The London Algebra Colloquium entitled \\"SQ-universal groups\\" on 23 May 1968. Examples of SQ-universal groups In 1949 Graham Higman, Bernhard Neumann and Hanna Neumann proved that every countable group can be embedded in a two-generator group.G. Higman, B.H. Neumann and H. Neumann, 'Embedding theorems for groups', J. London Math. Soc. 24 (1949), 247-254 Using the contemporary language of SQ- universality, this result says that F2, the free group (non-abelian) on two generators, is SQ-universal. This is the first known example of an SQ- universal group. Many more examples are now known: *Adding two generators and one arbitrary relator to a nontrivial torsion-free group, always results in an SQ-universal group.Anton A.

Ould Houcine has proved: : For every countable group G there exists a 2-generator SQ-universal group H such that G can be embedded in every non- trivial quotient of H.A.O. Houcine, 'Satisfaction of existential theories in finitely presented groups and some embedding theorems', Annals of Pure and Applied Logic, Volume 142, Issues 1-3 , October 2006, Pages 351-365 Some elementary properties of SQ-universal groups A free group on countably many generators h1, h2, ..., hn, ... , say, must be embeddable in a quotient of an SQ-universal group G. If h^*_1,h^*_2, \\\\dots ,h^*_n \\\\dots \\\\in G are chosen such that h^*_n \\\\mapsto h_n for all n, then they must freely generate a free subgroup of G. Hence: :Every SQ-universal group has as a subgroup, a free group on countably many generators. Since every countable group can be embedded in a countable simple group, it is often sufficient to consider embeddings of simple groups. This observation allows us to easily prove some elementary results about SQ-universal groups, for instance: :If G is an SQ- universal group and N is a normal subgroup of G (i.e. N\\\\triangleleft G) then either N is SQ-universal or the quotient group G/N is SQ-universal. To prove this suppose N is not SQ-universal, then there is a countable group K that cannot be embedded into a quotient group of N. Let H be any countable group, then the direct product H × K is also countable and hence can be embedded in a countable simple group S. Now, by hypothesis, G is SQ-universal so S can be embedded in a quotient group, G/M, say, of G. The second isomorphism theorem tells us: :MN/M \\\\cong N/(M \\\\cap N) Now MN/M\\\\triangleleft G/M and S is a simple subgroup of G/M so either: :MN/M \\\\cap S \\\\cong 1 or: :S\\\\subseteq MN/M \\\\cong N/(M \\\\cap N). The latter cannot be true because it implies K ⊆ H × K ⊆ S ⊆ N/(M ∩ N) contrary to our choice of K. It follows that S can be embedded in (G/M)/(MN/M), which by the third isomorphism theorem is isomorphic to G/MN, which is in turn isomorphic to (G/N)/(MN/N). Thus S has been embedded into a quotient group of G/N, and since H ⊆ S was an arbitrary countable group, it follows that G/N is SQ-universal. Since every subgroup H of finite index in a group G contains a normal subgroup N also of finite index in G,Lawson, Mark V. (1998) Inverse semigroups: the theory of partial symmetries, World Scientific. , [ p. 52] it easily follows that: :If a group G is SQ-universal then so is any finite index subgroup H of G. The converse of this statement is also true.P.M. Neumann: The SQ-universality of some finitely presented groups. J. Austral. Math. Soc. 16, 1-6 (1973) Variants and generalizations of SQ- universality Several variants of SQ-universality occur in the literature. The reader should be warned that terminology in this area is not yet completely stable and should read this section with this caveat in mind. Let \\\\mathcal{P} be a class of groups. (For the purposes of this section, groups are defined up to isomorphism) A group G is called SQ-universal in the class \\\\mathcal{P} if G\\\\in \\\\mathcal{P} and every countable group in \\\\mathcal{P} is isomorphic to a subgroup of a quotient of G. The following result can be proved: : Let n, m ∈ Z where m is odd, n>10^{78} and m > 1, and let B(m, n) be the free m-generator Burnside group, then every non-cyclic subgroup of B(m, n) is SQ-universal in the class of groups of exponent n. Let \\\\mathcal{P} be a class of groups. A group G is called SQ-universal for the class \\\\mathcal{P} if every group in \\\\mathcal{P} is isomorphic to a subgroup of a quotient of G. Note that there is no requirement that G\\\\in \\\\mathcal{P} nor that any groups be countable. The standard definition of SQ-universality is equivalent to SQ- universality both in and for the class of countable groups. Given a countable group G, call an SQ-universal group H G-stable, if every non-trivial factor group of H contains a copy of G. Let \\\\mathcal{G} be the class of finitely presented SQ-universal groups that are G-stable for some G then Houcine's version of the HNN theorem that can be re-stated as: : The free group on two generators is SQ-universal for \\\\mathcal{G}. However, there are uncountably many finitely generated groups, and a countable group can only have countably many finitely generated subgroups. It is easy to see from this that: : No group can be SQ-universal in \\\\mathcal{G}. An infinite class \\\\mathcal{P} of groups is wrappable if given any groups F,G\\\\in \\\\mathcal{P} there exists a simple group S and a group H\\\\in \\\\mathcal{P} such that F and G can be embedded in S and S can be embedded in H. The it is easy to prove: :If \\\\mathcal{P} is a wrappable class of groups, G is an SQ-universal for \\\\mathcal{P} and N\\\\triangleleft G then either N is SQ-universal for \\\\mathcal{P} or G/N is SQ- universal for \\\\mathcal{P}. :If \\\\mathcal{P} is a wrappable class of groups and H is of finite index in G then G is SQ-universal for the class \\\\mathcal{P} if and only if H is SQ-universal for \\\\mathcal{P}. The motivation for the definition of wrappable class comes from results such as the Boone-Higman theorem, which states that a countable group G has soluble word problem if and only if it can be embedded in a simple group S that can be embedded in a finitely presented group F. Houcine has shown that the group F can be constructed so that it too has soluble word problem. This together with the fact that taking the direct product of two groups preserves solubility of the word problem shows that: :The class of all finitely presented groups with soluble word problem is wrappable. Other examples of wrappable classes of groups are: *The class of finite groups. *The class of torsion free groups. *The class of countable torsion free groups. *The class of all groups of a given infinite cardinality. The fact that a class \\\\mathcal{P} is wrappable does not imply that any groups are SQ-universal for \\\\mathcal{P}. It is clear, for instance, that some sort of cardinality restriction for the members of \\\\mathcal{P} is required. If we replace the phrase \\"isomorphic to a subgroup of a quotient of\\" with \\"isomorphic to a subgroup of\\" in the definition of \\"SQ- universal\\", we obtain the stronger concept of S-universal (respectively S-universal for/in \\\\mathcal{P}). The Higman Embedding Theorem can be used to prove that there is a finitely presented group that contains a copy of every finitely presented group. If \\\\mathcal{W} is the class of all finitely presented groups with soluble word problem, then it is known that there is no uniform algorithm to solve the word problem for groups in \\\\mathcal{W}. It follows, although the proof is not a straightforward as one might expect, that no group in \\\\mathcal{W} can contain a copy of every group in \\\\mathcal{W}. But it is clear that any SQ-universal group is a fortiori SQ-universal for \\\\mathcal{W}. If we let \\\\mathcal{F} be the class of finitely presented groups, and F2 be the free group on two generators, we can sum this up as: *F2 is SQ- universal in \\\\mathcal{F} and \\\\mathcal{W}. *There exists a group that is S-universal in \\\\mathcal{F}. *No group is S-universal in \\\\mathcal{W}. The following questions are open (the second implies the first): *Is there a countable group that is not SQ-universal but is SQ-universal for \\\\mathcal{W}? *Is there a countable group that is not SQ-universal but is SQ-universal in \\\\mathcal{W}? While it is quite difficult to prove that F2 is SQ-universal, the fact that it is SQ-universal for the class of finite groups follows easily from these two facts: * Every symmetric group on a finite set can be generated by two elements * Every finite group can be embedded inside a symmetric group—the natural one being the Cayley group, which is the symmetric group acting on this group as the finite set. SQ-universality in other categories If \\\\mathcal{C} is a category and \\\\mathcal{P} is a class of objects of \\\\mathcal{C}, then the definition of SQ-universal for \\\\mathcal{P} clearly makes sense. If \\\\mathcal{C} is a concrete category, then the definition of SQ-universal in \\\\mathcal{P} also makes sense. As in the group theoretic case, we use the term SQ-universal for an object that is SQ- universal both for and in the class of countable objects of \\\\mathcal{C}. Many embedding theorems can be restated in terms of SQ-universality. Shirshov's Theorem that a Lie algebra of finite or countable dimension can be embedded into a 2-generator Lie algebra is equivalent to the statement that the 2-generator free Lie algebra is SQ-universal (in the category of Lie algebras). This can be proved by proving a version of the Higman, Neumann, Neumann theorem for Lie algebras.A.I. Lichtman and M. Shirvani, 'HNN- extensions of Lie algebras', Proc. American Math. Soc. Vol 125, Number 12, December 1997, 3501-3508 However versions of the HNN theorem can be proved for categories where there is no clear idea of a free object. For instance it can be proved that every separable topological group is isomorphic to a topological subgroup of a group having two topological generators (that is, having a dense 2-generator subgroup).Sidney A. Morris and Vladimir Pestov, 'A topological generalization of the Higman-Neumann-Neumann Theorem', Research Report RP-97-222 (May 1997), School of Mathematical and Computing Sciences, Victoria University of Wellington. See also J. Group Theory 1, No.2, 181-187 (1998). A similar concept holds for free lattices. The free lattice in three generators is countably infinite. It has, as a sublattice, the free lattice in four generators, and, by induction, as a sublattice, the free lattice in a countable number of generators.L.A.

These are captive iron ore mines for Bhilai Steel Plant (BSP)a SAIL enterprise. Iron ores mined from the area are of the hematite and magnetite variety. The other mines in the neighbourhood produce dolomite, lime and other raw materials which go into steel production. Dalli-Rajhara is about 83 km south of Durg and comes under the south-eastern section of the Indian Railways. While both Dalli and Rajhara have mines, the residential area is predominantly in Rajhara. Dalli-Rajhara is a self-sufficient township with BSP having set up hospitals and a considerable number of educational institutes. Dalli-Rajhara rose to prominence as a result of the labour rights movement in the 1970s. The mines are open cast mines and the poignant view as one enters the township at dusk is that of thousands of glittering lights on the hills. The expert appraisal committee (EAC) of the ministry had met during the last three days to clear a shelf of stranded projects entailing an investment of nearly Rs 80,000 crore. The EAC has cleared 12 of these projects. The committee is expected to meet shortly again to take a call on the remaining projects. Among those cleared on Saturday are SAIL's proposed 1 million tonne per annum pellet plant along with upstream slime beneficiation facilities at its Dalli-Rajhara iron ore mine in Chhattisgarh. Transport This area is connected via rail and road with its district balod. It is well connected by bus to the Durg and Bastar region. The road is in quite good shape. Only one passenger train runs between Dalli and Durg. Much development is due on the rail connectivity front. There is an ongoing rail link with Jagdalpur. =Extending Rail Transport= Union Railway Budget of 2012–13 has proposed new links to existing Durg-Dalli Rajhara Railway line. * Ongoing Project of Dalli Rajhara - Rawghat - Jagdalpur.(Phase 1 first stretch Dalli Rajhara-Keoti work has been started). * Extension of Trains: 78816/78815 Dalli rajhara – Durg DEMU to Raipur. * New Line Surveys for Extending proposed Dalli Rajhara railway line by constructing it up to Balod-Dhamtari. * New Line Surveys for Dalli Rajhara – Chandrapur (Maharashtra) via Khadgaon, BharriTola and Manpur. * New Line Surveys for Linking Bhanupratappur with Dalli Rajhara – Rawghat under construction rail line and connecting it with Jagdalpur. Culture The majority of the population is dependent on BSP for their livelihood. Being a public sector company, BSP has attracted people across India from Bihar to Bengal to Kerala. The pace of life is slower than in the cities. Festivals ranging from Durgapuja to Chatt Puja to ONAM to Christmas are all celebrated. In brief, the culture is quite cosmopolitan with a flavour of modesty in lifestyle. The cost of living is relatively low. Among the employees of BSP, many religions are present in the community, as well as people from different parts of India. There are various clubs for social activities. Durga Puja of Camp 1 ground, Flower show organized by BSP in Saptgiri Park are regular events every year.

Dalmau also enjoys a unique place in the literary world because it was here that the famous Hindi poet, Surya Kant Tripath Nirala wrote his poems while sitting on the fort and overlooking the scene below. Dalmau was also centre of sufism in fourteen century because Maulana Daud a Chishti saint who was attached to Dalmau royal court was living here and he wrote first awadhi masnawi world famous book Chandayan. Dalmau is also home to the Ebrahim Sharki palace belonging to the Nawab Shuza-ud-daula. Visitors can also see the Baithak of Alhaa Udal and enjoy a stroll along the Dalmau Pump canal. Famous Personalities: Maulana Daud (Mulla Daud), Pandit Suryakant Tripathi Nirala, Baba Lalan Das, Miran Shah Geography It is located at Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Dalmau and has an average elevation of 115 metres (377 feet). Name and history According to tradition, Dalmau is named after its founder, Dal Deo, the brother of Ram Deo, the Raja of Kannauj. In 423 AH, Dalmau was conquered by Salar Sahu, the father of the semi-legendary Islamic warrior Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud. He granted the estate of Dalmau to one Malik Abdullah. There are still martyrs' tombs in Dalmau said to date from the time of this conquest, serving as the final resting place of Ghalib, Maliks Ali and Wali, and other Islamic martyrs. About two centuries later, Dalmau flourished under the reign of Iltutmish, third ruler of the Delhi Sultanate. Makhdum Badr ud-Din, a companion of the sultan, resided in Dalmau at that time. Dalmau continued to prosper under Firoz Shah Tughlaq, who founded a madrasa in Dalmau. Also during his reign, a local notable named Yusuf built an Eidgah in Dalmau; it was later replaced by a newer structure, but the foundation stone is still visible, inscribed with a pair of couplets bearing Yusuf's name as well as the date of construction, 759 AH. In 1394, as the Delhi Sultanate's crumbling Tughlaq dynasty was caught up in a civil war, members the Bhar tribe rose to power in Dalmau. Soon after, when the subahdar of Jaunpur, Khwaja Malik Sarwar, declared independence, thus founding the Jaunpur Sultanate. He claimed rule over the province of Dalmau, alongside those of Kannauj, Sandila, Bahraich, and Bihar; however, his authority over Dalmau was only nominal, as the Bhars retained possession of it. This came to an end under the Jaunpur sultan Ibrahim Shah Sharqi, who sent an army to conquer Dalmau, supposedly because the Bhar ruler, Dal, sought to marry the daughter of a local sayyid known as Baba Haji. After defeating and killing Dal's brother Kakori at the nearby village of Sudamanpur on the day of Holi, Ibrahim Shah captured Dalmau and slaughtered the Bhar inhabitants. In memory of this massacre, local women of the Bharonia cast do not wear nose rings or glass bangles. Dal's tomb is 2 miles from Dalmau, and local Bhars offer milk there during the month of Sawan. After Ibrahim Shah's conquest of Dalmau, many Muslim settlers came to live in Dalmau and other nearby towns, including Raebareli, Bhawan, Jalalpur Dehi, and Thulendi. Meanwhile, in 820 AH, Ibrahim Shah began an ambitious construction project in the area, building new forts at Bhawan, Raebareli, and Thulendi, as well as rebuilding the Bhar fort of Dalmau, which had been damaged during the previous conquest. The Dalmau fort has since largely fallen into ruin, although its thana and gatehouse still stand. It is believed to have been built on top of an even earlier Buddhist stupa. Ibrahim also constructed a masonry well and a garden by the bank of the river in Dalmau. His grandson Muhammad Shah is buried in a tomb within this garden, in a structure known as the Maqbara-e-Shah-e-Sharqi. Dalmau's fort appears to have been a royal one, due to the appointment of various officers typical of royal forts: a mutawalli or superintendent, a muhtasib or censor, a nasihi or legal advisor, a qasbati, who provided supplies for civil and military officials, a ghariali, who struck the hours on the gate, and a guldagha, who branded the horses and oxen of the cavalry. Some of these officials received hereditary lands in addition to their position: for example, the gharialis held the village of Nasirpur Kirtali on a rent-free tenure through the time of the British Raj. Dalmau remained an important city long after the end of the Jaunpur Sultanate. The Delhi sultan Sikandar Lodi married the widow of Sheri, the governor of Dalmau, here in 1491, and the city appears frequently in the annals of the historian Firishta. During the reign of the Mughal emperor Akbar, one Mirza Shukrullah served as the faujdar of Dalmau. He repaired the mosque of Makhdum Badr ud-Din, and his own stone mausoleum still stands. During the reign of Shah Jahan, Sherandaz Khan served as the faujdar of Dalmau. He founded a mahallah, named Sherandazpur after himself, in Dalmau. He also built an imambara and a mosque within the fort's precinct. Shuja-ud-Daula, the Nawab of Oudh from 1754 to 1775, built a brick mansion and a garden 2 miles north of Dalmau; however, the house was destroyed during the British raj to make way for the road from Dalmau to Lalganj; only the southern wall still stands. Saadat Ali Khan II, the penultimate Nawab of Oudh, was born in this mansion. In 1146 AH, the Maratha commander Pandit Gopal Rao crossed the Ganges from the south and sacked Dalmau, and the city went into decline. Dalmau was originally the seat of what would become Lalganj tehsil, losing this status in 1864. It was made a pargana by Akbar, in the sarkar of Manikpur and the subah of Allahabad. It remained a pargana through the time of the Raj. Before being constituted as a pargana, the territory of Dalmau had been divided into six districts: Haweli (Dalmau itself), Jalalpur, Birkha, Bhai, Satawan, and Pandaria. This division was made by Ibrahim Shah Sharqi.

Hamas held him captive for over five years, until his release on 18 October 2011 as part of a prisoner exchange deal. During his captivity, Hamas turned down requests from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to be allowed to visit Shalit, claiming that any such visit could betray his location. Multiple human rights organizations criticized this stance, claiming that the conditions of Shalit's confinement were contrary to international humanitarian law. The Red Cross stated, \\"The Shalit family have the right under international humanitarian law to be in contact with their son\\". The only communication in the early months came through an intermediary, who claimed that a low-ranking Hamas official, Ghazi Hamad, asked him to convey to Shalit's parents assurance that Shalit was \\"alive and was treated according to Islam's laws regarding prisoners of war, in other words, he had been given shelter, food and medical care.\\" The United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict called for Shalit's release in its September 2009 report. In its 27 May 2011 Deauville Declaration, the G8 demanded Shalit's release. Shalit's capture has been deemed a kidnapping and abduction by many sources. He was not granted any visits from the Red Cross and was not allowed to communicate with family members (to which he is entitled as a captured soldier under the Geneva Conventions), and a ransom, even if not of a monetary nature, was demanded for his return. The only contact between Shalit and the outside world after his capture and before his release were three letters, an audio tape, and a DVD that Israel received in return for releasing 20 female Palestinian prisoners. Shalit was captured near the Kerem Shalom crossing in Israel, and held by Hamas at an unknown location in the Gaza Strip. Hamas' initial demands of releasing of all female and underage Palestinians as well as Marwan Barghouti were not met. On 18 October 2011, he was released in a deal that secured his freedom after more than five years in isolation and captivity, in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, including some convicted of multiple murders and carrying out attacks against Israeli civilians (according to Israeli government sources, the prisoners released were collectively responsible for 569 Israeli deathsArmy Radio newscast, 20 October 2011). , Haaretz.co.il; accessed 14 October 2018., \\"[K]idnapped soldier Gilad Shalit\\" , upi.com; accessed 14 October 2018.\\"In Shalit deal, Israel did cross its own red lines\\", Haaretz.com, 14 October 2011.

Noam Chomsky has drawn attention to the cause-and-effect and also to the differences in treatment in the Western media between the Muamar detention that took place a day earlier, and the abduction of Gilad Shalit. The Israeli army seized the two Palestinian Muamar brothers in an overnight raid into the southern Gaza Strip on 24 June 2006, who were accused of being members of Hamas and planning attacks on Israel. Hamas said they were sons of a member but were not involved in Hamas. According to a report by the Army Radio, published nearly a year after the occurrence, the IDF had received a warning on 24 June 2006, the day before Shalit was captured, about a planned abduction. Israeli security forces entered the Gaza Strip and arrested the two brothers. The report said that the brothers were transferred to Israel for interrogation, and that the information extracted formed the basis for the warning that militants would try to enter Israel through tunnels to capture soldiers stationed near Gaza.

Attorney Dalia Gavriely- Nur, a lecturer at Bar-Ilan University, said that the camp opposing the prisoners deal was holding onto a view of collectivist society, in which the individual was expected to sacrifice himself for the good of society; the camp supporting the prisoner release was expressing, however, a high value on the sanctity of life, that symbolizes a shift to a more privatized society.

Gilad Shalit's father Noam also spoke at the social justice protest in Tel Aviv. =Gilad Shalit Worldwide Tehillim Project= The Gilad Shalit Worldwide Tehillim Project was established to support the reciting of Tehillim (Psalms) for Gilad Shalit. The goal is to have all of Tehillim recited daily. Life after release Toward Shalit's release, the Israeli Defense Ministry decided, as precedent, that Shalit will be recognized as a disabled veteran with at least 20% disability, immediately upon his release from captivity. Shalit was a corporal when he was abducted, and during his captivity he was promoted to sergeant. After his release, Shalit returned to his parents' home in Mitzpe Hila. His release, the focus of attention in Israel and abroad, attracted many media outlets and ordinary citizens to Mitzpe Hila. Out of courtesy to Shalit, and given the sensitivity of the issue, many Israeli media outlets pledged to avoid intensive coverage that may compromise his privacy. After returning from captivity, Shalit began medical treatment for his injuries. On 4 November, he underwent surgery at Rambam Medical Center in Haifa to remove pieces of shrapnel that had been lodged in his arm during the abduction. During the two-hour operation, doctors found and removed seven pieces of shrapnel from his elbow and forearm, two of which were pressing on nerves. The defense establishment decided to enable Shalit to acclimatize first, after captivity, before beginning the debriefing. Ordinarily, debriefing is conducted immediately upon the arrival home of Israeli POWs and captives. In January 2012, Noam Shalit, Gilad's father, announced his intention to run on the Israeli Labor Party's candidates list during primaries for the Knesset. On 18 April 2012, Gilad Shalit was discharged from the IDF with the rank of sergeant major. After returning home, Shalit met with, among others, Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu and French President Nicolas Sarkozy at his residence the Élysée Palace, and he is often followed by the media into sports and other events, in which a public figure is photographed with him. In June 2012, Shalit, an avid sports enthusiast and fan of Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C., found employment as a sports reporter for Yedioth Ahronoth, covering Israeli and European basketball in a regular column. His first assignment was in the United States, covering the 2012 NBA Finals in Oklahoma City.

Captured at one point, Urracá managed to escape a ship bound for Spain and rejoin his people. He continued to lead the fight against the Spanish until he was killed in battle in 1531. He is remembered as el caudillo amerindio de Veragua (the Amerind leader of Veragua) and adversary of the Spanish Empire), the great resistance leader of Panama. He has been honored by his image on the centesimo, the smallest-denomination coin of Panama. History Shortly after the foundation of Panama City in 1519, the Spanish Governor-Captain Pedrarias Dávila began moving into the country, hoping to find a gold-rich village. The Spanish conquered the Veragua province, which is particularly rich in gold mining. Urracá's territory was in the vicinity of the present town of Nata de los Caballeros, founded on 20 May 1520 to serve as a basis for exploration of the rest of Central America. Urracá and his forces bravely faced the Spanish expedition for almost nine years, and repeatedly defeated the conquistadors, led by Gaspar de Espinosa. When Espinosa was called back to Panama City by Pedrarias Dávila, Francisco de Compañón was commissioned to his post. Urracá attacked the Spanish warriors, but Compañón sent a messenger to report to Panama City to seek aid, and Pedrarias sent a relief battalion led by Hernán Ponce de León. Urracá succeeded in making alliances with tribes that had been traditional enemies, in order to unite to defeat the Spaniards. 18649121 Caciques such as Ponca, Dures, Duraria, Bulaba, Guisia, Guaniaga, Tabor, Guracona, Guaniagos and other great masters of Veragua united under his command. Ponce de León succeeded in breaking the siege of Nata, and he was followed by Pedrarias commanding new forces that reinforced the Spanish at Nata. Bloody clashes continued, without any of the parties achieving complete victory. In a subsequent battle, Urracá's forces managed to defeat Captain Diego de Albitres, who escaped and reported to the governor of Castilla del Oro. =Capture of Urracá= Led by Compañón, the Spanish attempted to capture Urracá with a trick. They sent emissaries to his territory to propose peace negotiations in Nata de los Caballeros. Urracá accepted the invitation and attended the site along with two of his men, but Compañón captured him, sending the chief to Nombre de Dios for transport to Spain. Urracá escaped and reunited with his people, maintaining his resistance against the Spanish forces for several years. Recognition Opposite the facade of Escuela Normal in the city of Santiago, capital of the province of Veraguas, stands a statue of Urracá with a warrior expression as if willing to attack the Spanish conquistadors. In his honor, the Asociación Nacional de Scouts de Panamá calls Scout Urracá the highest rank awarded to those who have made outstanding community service.

It is known only by the type specimen, a male collected in 1938 on Minami Daitō-jima, the main island of the Daito Archipelago east of Okinawa. Yamashina described the bird as a new subspecies after comparing it with 114 specimens from surrounding areas and under the impression that the Eurasian wren is a fairly sedentary bird, not liable to be drifted astray over long distances. Its scientific name honors Yamashina's specimen collector, Hyojiri Orii. However, stray Eurasian wrens have more recently been found on Yonaguni and Okinawa Islands. Thus, it has been hypothesized that the Daito bird was just a straggler from the Honshū (T. t. fumigatus), the Yakushima/Tanegashima (T. t. ogawae) or the Izu Islands (T. t. mosukei) population (Vaurie, 1955). As the specimen exists (Yamashina Institute for Ornithology collection No. 25476), it should be possible to resolve its status by DNA analysis. Certainly, many bird populations on islands south of Japan became extinct in the late 1930s as settlement and civilian and military construction destroyed large amounts of habitat.

It is one of the major subdivisions with 398 villages under its jurisdiction. History According to a report by The Tribune newspaper in 1977, the town is referred to in the ancient Indian epic, the Mahabharata, as being the seat of king Virata. In recognition of this, Dasuya is still referred to as Virat Ki Nagri today. In the closing decade of the fourteenth century, Dasuya at least twice witnessed the passage of an army during the struggle against the Muslim conquerors, Abu Bakar and Amir Taimur. Later, in December 1557, the army of the incumbent Sultan Akbar, led by his governor of Lahore, Khizr Khan, camped at the town while dealing successfully with a threat posed by Sikandar Sur. More recently, Dasuya featured in debates related to the emergence of Himachal Pradesh. Verma has noted that \\"Perhaps no other State of India has suffered as many territorial and political changes in recent times as the Punjab\\". Within the process of the linguistic reorganization of states, the claim that Dasuya should be incorporated into Himachal Pradesh on the grounds that it was the home of Dogras was rejected because that point was irrelevant to the linguistic issue. Dasuya remained in Punjab when the negotiations culminated in the Punjab Reorganisation Act of 1966. Demographics The provisional statistics for 2011 census of India show that Dasuya urban had a population of 56,204 and the Dasuya subdivision is 360,505.

He told his story in a series in the Saturday Evening Post, and his experiences were then fictionalized in the old time radio show I Was a Communist for the FBI, adapted for a Warner Brothers motion picture in 1951. He testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee in the 1950s. Life Cvetic was born in 1909 to Slovenian immigrants living in Pittsburgh. One of 11 children, Cvetic graduated from St. Mary's Roman Catholic Grammar School in 1922. Thereafter, his formal education is difficult to verify, in part due to the often-contradictory testimony he provided before various audiences over the course of his career. At various points he claimed to have attended \\"prep school or college,\\" although during a hostile cross examination in 1954 was forced to admit that he had only completed the tenth grade.Daniel J. Leab, I Was a Communist for the FBI: The Unhappy Life and Times of Matt Cvetic. University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2000; pg. 6. Before his employment with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Cvetic worked a series of jobs, including various sales positions as well as briefly serving at the Pennsylvania State Department of Labor and Industry.Leab, I Was a Communist for the FBI, pg. 7. On August 15, 1931, he married a pregnant Marie Barsh, who gave birth to twin sons the next year. The marriage proved to be a tumultuous one, as Barsh claimed that he was physically and verbally abusive with her as well as unfaithful, leading to a separation followed by a divorce in January, 1946.Leab, I Was a Communist for the FBI, pg. 8. This period was especially difficult for Cvetic as he was arrested in 1939 after allegedly having beaten his sister-in-law badly enough that she required hospitalization. During World War II, he volunteered to join the United States Army but was rejected for being too short. In April 1942, Cvetic came to the attention of the FBI which offered him the opportunity to penetrate the American Communist Party as part of their broader anti-communist efforts.Leab, I Was a Communist for the FBI, pg. 12. Cvetic quickly agreed, and by the end of 1942, was considered suitable material for membership in the Pittsburgh branch CPUSA, his membership being granted to him in February, 1943. Shortly after his joining the party, Cvetic was offered weekly compensation in the amount of $15, which was increased to $35 per week in late 1943, then $65 by 1947.Leab, I Was a Communist for the FBI, pg. 17. By 1948 he was earning $85 per week for his work, and although he continually pressured the Bureau to increase his salary to $100 and threatened to quit if his requests were not granted, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover rebuffed his requests.Leab, I Was a Communist for the FBI, pg. 19. Despite the valuable information provided to the FBI by Cvetic, his increasingly erratic behavior began to undermine his credibility with both the Bureau as well as the CPUSA. As early as 1946, Cvetic had been identified as a potential FBI mole by Hearst reporter James Moore. In 1947, Cvetic was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct and while in the Pittsburgh city jail allegedly shouted \\"you can't do this to me, I work for the FBI!\\"Leab, I Was a Communist for the FBI, pg. 21. In addition, Cvetic had difficulty maintaining his cover and, by his own admission, had admitted to several people that he worked for the FBI, including his brother, his psychiatrist, and \\"more than one girl.\\" By 1947, the FBI was considering discontinuing the use of Cvetic as an informant due to his security breaches, but ultimately decided to continue employing him. The depth to which Cvetic penetrated the CPUSA remains unclear. Although subsequent film and radio adaptations portrayed Cvetic as one of the party's primary operatives in the United States, Cvetic did not appear to have risen above the party's lower echelons. At a HUAC report on the American Slav Congress in 1949, Cvetic was listed as \\"a Slovenian Communist Party member.\\"Leab, I Was a Communist for the FBI, pg. 20. He was trusted enough by the party to be allowed access to numerous party documents and files, but by his own admission, by the end of his career Cvetic was employed by the CPUSA, \\"doing odd jobs.\\" In February 1950, Cvetic surfaced for the first time and was summoned to testify before HUAC.Leab, \\"I Was a Communist for the FBI,\\" pg. 49. During this testimony he was accompanied by several Communist Party members from Pittsburgh who he had been working with, and they did not find out he was an undercover FBI agent until he began testifying against them, despite having accomanied him to the hearing.I Was a Communist for the FBI: Matt Cvetic The True Life and Times of Undercover Agent Matt Cvetic by Gus Payne, 2004. pg. 80-81 During his testimony in February 1950 and in subsequent sessions throughout the rest of the year, Cvetic named several hundred people as members of the CPUSA, and provided information regarding the internal workings of the Pittsburgh branch of CPUSA as well as various allegedly communist-controlled organizations. However, while Cvetic was considered a reliable witness when testifying in front of friendly audiences, hostile cross-examinations often left him at a loss for words, unable to remember key details and often refusing to answer questions on the grounds that he did not wish to give away FBI secrets to the communists.Leab, I Was a Communist for the FBI, pg. 69. While testifying at the trials of CPUSA leader Steve Nelson for sedition in 1951 and 1952, Cvetic was questioned on the stand by Nelson who, acting as his own counsel, repeatedly referred to Cvetic as \\"a fingerman\\" and \\"professional patriot.\\" Cvetic continued to appear at various government hearings until 1955. I Was a Communist for the FBI On July 14, 1950, Cvetic was featured in the television series We the People, a half-hour program hosted by Dan Seymour detailing his alleged activities while operating as an FBI informant.Leab, I Was a Communist for the FBI, pg. 72. Concurrently, on July 15, 22, and 29, 1950, Cvetic published his story in serial format in the Saturday Evening Post, written by Pete Martin. These stories sparked the public's interest in Cvetic, resulting in the production of the radio series and feature film. =Radio serial= In 1952, the Frederick W. Ziv Company presented I was a Communist for the FBI as a radio serial. The series had Dana Andrews as the voice of Cvetic and also had a $12,000 budget which was a significant amount for a radio show. The show had the tagline \\"I'm a communist for the FBI, I walk alone.\\" . It ran for 72 episodes between 1952 and 1954. In the series, Cvetic is an undercover agent of the FBI who infiltrates many Communist spy rings within the United States. Cvetic poses as a faithful party member to gain information on Communist plots designed to destroy the U.S. Except for his superiors in the FBI and a local priest, no one, not even members of Cvetic's family, knows that he is merely posing as a Communist. =Movie= Warner Bros. purchased the rights to the Post story and released I Was a Communist for the FBI on May 5, 1951. Although the story was fictionalized, the movie was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1952. A notable feature of the movie is Cvetic's report of anti-black attitudes among many of the Party leadership. One character, closely modeled on Party leader Steve Nelson remarks with contempt after a rally aimed at blacks \\"boy, those niggers really ate it up, didn't they?\\" =Writing= In November 1959 the first editions of \\"The Big Decision\\" were published. This was Cvetic's personal account of his actions as a counterspy, many of the names in the story were changed to protect identities. Later life With the waning of anti-communism in the 1950s, Cvetic struggled to find buyers who were interested in his story as well as his testimony. As early as 1953, attorneys had declined to utilize him as a witness due to recurring concerns regarding the quality of his testimony.Leab, I Was a Communist for the FBI, pg. 99. By 1955, Cvetic had been largely discredited as a witness. On April 21, 1955, the Justice Department's Committee on Security Witnesses unanimously recommended that Cvetic not be used as a witness unless his testimony could be corroborated by external sources.Leab, I Was a Communist for the FBI, pg. 101. This coincided with continued FBI concerns regarding Cvetic's embellishment of the facts, including one instance in which he claimed to have defused a Nazi spy plot single-handedly.Leab, I Was a Communist for the FBI, pg. 98. In the hopes of capitalizing on his fame to achieve political goals, Cvetic ran in the Republican primary for Pennsylvania's 28th district in May, 1954, but failed to win the nomination. In February, 1955, a depressed Cvetic was admitted to St. Francis Hospital in Pittsburgh by his son for a psychiatric evaluation following several days of heavy drinking. Cvetic was readmitted a short time later and received electroconvulsive therapy in March 1955, after which he was released.Leab, I Was a Communist for the FBI, pg. 105. Shortly thereafter on March 16, the INS stated that it was no longer using Cvetic as a witness in deportation hearings. Throughout the late 1950s, Cvetic attempted to rekindle interest in his usefulness as an anti-communist expert witness, and supplemented his income by engaging in speaking tours throughout the United States.Leab, I Was a Communist for the FBI, pg. 120. In 1960, Cvetic became involved with the John Birch Society as well as the Christian Crusade, a strongly anti-communist organization led by Reverend Billy James Hargis. On July 26, 1962, Cvetic suffered a heart attack and died at age 53 while waiting to take a driver's license exam in Los Angeles, California.

In ancient times a sage, 'Dhaumya Rishi' used to stay here, hence people started calling this place after him: 'Dhaum'. Gradually 'Dhaum' became 'Dhoand', then 'Dhaundh', and before it getting corrupted to the present name 'Daund'. According to the Epic Mahabharata Krishna's wife Rukhmini had gone in the 'Dhindir forest', this ancient 'Dhindir Van' is today's Daund.

Hence forth Bajirao and Mastani met at the Firangai Devi temple in Kurkumbh. Water of the rivers Bhima, Nira, Pravara, Ghod and Godavari are best suited to the horses, hence the horses breeding on these waters used to be strong, quick and loyal. The area of 'Bhimthadi' which is close to Daund was known for getting good breed of horses and people preferred to get a pony only from this place. Hence the horse business in Daund has flourished. At the end of the Peshwa Era due to heavy loans on them Daund and some villages from Pune had gone in control of 'Girgosavi'. =British rule= Daund was extensively developed during the British rule. When railways were started during the British rule in 1870, the Bombay-Solapur railway passed via Daund, and the Daund-Baramati narrow gauge track was constructed.

The “ early Earth” encompasses approximately the first gigayear (Ga, 109 y) in the evolution of our planet, from its initial formation in the young Solar System at about 4.55 Ga to sometime in the Archean eon at about 3.5 Ga. On the geologic time scale, this comprises all of the Hadean eon (starting with the formation of the Earth about 4.6 billion years ago), as well as the Eoarchean (starting 4 billion years ago) and part of the Paleoarchean (starting 3.6 billion years ago) eras of the Archean eon. This period of Earth's history involved the planet's formation from the solar nebula via a process known as accretion. This time period included intense meteorite bombardment as well as giant impacts, including the Moon-forming impact, which resulted in a series of magma oceans and episodes of core formation. After formation of the core, delivery of meteoritic or cometary material in a \\"late veneer\\" may have delivered water and other volatile compounds to the Earth. Although little crustal material from this period survives, the oldest dated specimen is a zircon mineral of 4.404 ± 0.008 Ga enclosed in a metamorphosed sandstone conglomerate in the Jack Hills of the Narryer Gneiss Terrane of Western Australia. The earliest supracrustals (such as the Isua greenstone belt) date from the latter half of this period, about 3.8 gya, around the same time as peak Late Heavy Bombardment. According to evidence from radiometric dating and other sources, Earth formed about 4.54 billion years ago. Within its first billion years,See:  life appeared in its oceans and began to affect its atmosphere and surface, promoting the proliferation of aerobic as well as anaerobic organisms. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, its physical properties and its geological history have allowed life to emerge, develop photosynthesis, and, later, evolve further and thrive. The earliest life on Earth arose at least 3.5 billion years ago.Schopf, JW, Kudryavtsev, AB, Czaja, AD, and Tripathi, AB. (2007). Evidence of Archean life: Stromatolites and microfossils.

It is the headquarters of the Dayalbagh sect of the Radhasoami faith where the 8th revered leader (Sant Satguru) lives and presides over the satsang (holy service). It is a self-sustained colony, where its inhabitants lead an active, disciplined and co-operative community life, conforming to the spiritual ideals of their faith. It has affiliated educational institutes such as the Dayalbagh Educational Institute affiliated to Dayalbagh University (deemed). Radhasoami Satsang Sabha is the chief working committee of Radhasoami Faith Dayalbagh. Demographics As of the 2001 India census, Dayalbagh had a population of 3324. Males constitute 51% of the population and females 49%. In Dayalbagh, 8% of the population is under six years of age. History The colony of Dayalbagh was founded on the Basant Day (translation: first day of spring) on 20 January 1915 by Sir Anand Swarup (Huzur Sahab Ji Maharaj), the Fifth Revered Leader of Radhasoami Faith, as an ashram or a spiritual home for the followers of the faith, by planting a mulberry tree. The colony was built by the voluntary contribution (by money as well as labor) of the early residents, who considered it as Sewa (social service). The fields near Yamuna river were also acquired by Dayalbagh and as a daily practice, residents and devotees coming from outside leveled the uneven landmass and irrigated it, making it a fertile land from the barren desert. Today also, the devotees give their voluntary contribution everyday in agricultural activities in the fields. Community life The colony is laid out in an open garden setting. The land where the colony was established once consisted of sand dunes. For more than 60 years residents of the colony - men and women, young and old - have worked with quiet dedication in a vast programme for reclamation of land launched in 1943 by Huzur Mehtaji Maharaj, the sixth Revered Leader of the Faith. The result is a lush green farm where food-grains, oil-seeds, fodder, and vegetables are grown. Shrubs are planted around houses, as part of the environmental protection movement No individual owns property in Dayalbagh, as the land, houses and institutions belong to the community. People live and work as a community. For example, the residents share various responsibilities like cleaning up the colony and arranging night security. The colony has its own water supply, electricity distribution, and civic services. The colony's dairy provides most of the milk that is needed, and a community kitchen that supplies food at a very nominal cost (no-profit, no-loss basis) to pilgrims. The residents can also obtain meals from there and free themselves from household chores. A typical house in the residential streets of Dayalbagh. Soamibagh Soamibagh is an area adjacent to Dayalbagh. The land was purchased by Soamiji Maharaj. Soamiji's Samadh has been under construction since building began in 1905 by Guru Maharaj Saheb, and continues till today. The construction involves magnificent piece of art work. A variety of fruits, vegetables and flowers are carved out on walls and pillars on Marble stone. Health care There is a hospital called as \\"Saran Ashram Hospital\\" with a maternity ward. Facilities exist for ophthalmic and dental treatment, ultrasound, ECG, and pathological and X-Ray testing. All consultations and treatment are free for everyone. The majority of patients are from outside Dayalbagh. There are also homeopathic and ayurvedic dispensaries. Peacocks are common in the residential areas of Dayalbagh The day in Dayalbagh begins with congregational prayers, followed by physical fitness exercise and work on the farms and in colony by way of service, where after people go to their respective vocations. The day ends with prayers in the evening. Industries Small-scale industries known as the Model Industries were established in 1916 to provide employment and a source of livelihood to the persons residing in the colony. It has done some pioneering work in the country. The industries have now been decentralized and cottage scale production of goods of daily necessity is taking place in units set up by Satsangis all over the country. The Radhasoami Urban Cooperative Bank and the Dayalbagh Mahila Bank cater to the financial requirements of various organizations and individuals in the colony. The Dayalbagh Printing Press prints Holy Books and the two Satsang weeklies, one in English (also available in its e-version) and the other in Hindi.  Dayalbagh Educational Institute  The foundation of a school was laid after 2 years of the foundation of the colony in 1917. The school has grown in course of time to become a Deemed University-Dayalbagh Educational Institute-with various faculties with facilities for research. In 1981 the Ministry of Education, Government of India, conferred the status of an institution deemed to be a University on the Dayalbagh Educational Institute, to implement the new program of undergraduate studies. Prof. M. B. Lal Sahab, a former Vice Chancellor of the Lucknow University, founded this institution and was also the first director of DEI The education system followed is unique and provides value-based multi- disciplinary education with work experience. In addition, the colony has a diploma level Technical College, a Women's Polytechnic, a nursery, primary level schools and secondary level colleges for boys and girls; a school of Languages; a School of Art and Culture; a Tailoring School; a School of Dress Designing and Interior Decoration; a Day Boarding School; a Training Center for Indian Music; and a Leather Working School. The campus is situated in Dayalbagh, away from the noise of the city. It is situated at a distance of about two Km. from the city of Agra on its northern periphery. It is conveniently connected to the railway stations and bus-stands by the city bus, rickshaws, auto-rickshaws and taxies. The Dayalbagh suburb gained national attention when Neha Sharma, a PhD. scholar was found murdered in the nano- biotechnology lab of the Dayalbagh Educational Institute. Students of the institute protested on the streets of Agra to demand justice.  Other colonies in Dayalbagh suburb of Agra  New residential colonies have developed around Dayalbagh, such as Tagore Nagar, Adan Bagh, Sarla Bagh, Heera Bagh, Mehar Bagh, Kabir Nagar , Saraswati Puram, Punjabi Bagh Pushpanjali etc. The residents of these new colonies follow religions of their choice and not necessarily Radha Soami faith. This area is also called New Agra where many people have settled down around 100 ft Road.  Propagation of Radhasoami Faith  It is the belief of the followers of the Radhasoami Faith that the Message of Huzur Radhasoami Dayal regarding the Faith will spread not by any propaganda or by proselytisation but by example of pious and religious life of simplicity, cooperation and mutual affection lived by Satsangis. They believe in the ideal of Fatherhood of God and Brotherhood of Man and have respect for all Faiths and religions and their Leaders. Apart from participation in Satsang and meditation and spiritual practices, they carry out various activities for benefit of the people, Satsangis and others in a spirit of service to mankind. Schools and dispensaries and first-aid centres have been established which are open to all. They also undertake production of goods of daily necessity which are made available virtually at cost. These serve the triple objective of developing productive skills, formation of a habit of cooperative work and ameliorating economic hardship. The goods are sold through exhibitions which are open to all. Of course the Satsang literature and Holy Books are available in various languages primarily in Hindi and English but also in Bengali, Gujrati, Marathi, Telugu and Tamil but there is no preaching or propaganda. That the message is spreading is seen by the fact that several thousand persons are seeking initiation into the Faith every year.

It is part of Pacific Air Forces' Eleventh Air Force. The 36th Wing provides day-to-day mission support to more than 9,000 military, civilian, dependent and retired personnel and 15 associate units on the base. The 36th Wing has three major missions: operate Andersen Air Force Base via its subordinate 36th Mission Support and 36th Medical Groups; Provide power projection through an attached, rotational bomber force via its subordinate 36th Operations and 36th Maintenance Groups; and provide rapid air base opening and initial air base operation ability via its subordinate 36th Contingency Response Group.

The former USAAF 36th Fighter Group became the operational component of the new Air Force wing. Active squadrons of the 36th were: * 22d Fighter Squadron (F-80A/B, Red color band) * 23d Fighter Squadron (F-80A/B, Blue color band) * 53d Fighter Squadron (F-80A/B, Green color band) =United States Air Forces in Europe= Republic F-84E-10-RE Thunderjet Serial 49-2299 of the 23d Fighter-Bomber Squadron, 1951, flown by the Wing Commander Col.

Doneski of the 53rd FS shot down an Iraqi Su-22M flying 84-014 on 20 March 1991. As a result of the Berlin Blockade and other Cold War tensions in Europe, the 36th Fighter Wing was reassigned to United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE). The squadron was assigned to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base West Germany on 13 August 1948, being the first USAFE unit to be jet-equipped with the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star. At Fürstenfeldbruck tactical operations included air defense, tactical exercises, maneuvers, and photographic reconnaissance. In May 1949, the wing formed the Skyblazers aerial demonstration team, which it controlled until August 1952, and again from October 1956 to January 1962 when it was disbanded. On 20 January 1950, the wing was redesignated as the 36th Fighter-Bomber Wing when 89 Republic F-84E Thunderjets arrived. Existing USAFE bases in West Germany, however, were deemed very vulnerable to an attack by the Soviet Union, given their proximity to East Germany and other Warsaw Pact nations. Negotiations with other NATO nations were made to build new bases west of the Rhine River. The F-80s were sent back to CONUS to equip Air National Guard units. In addition to its primary installation at Fürstenfeldbruck, the wing controlled Oberpfaffenhofen AB, West Germany, December 1949 – February 1950. The 36th FBW remained at Fürstenfeldbruck until 1952 when it was reassigned to the new Bitburg Air Base, in the Eifel mountains west of the Rhine River. Throughout the summer, elements of the 36th FBW moved into Bitburg, with the wing officially arriving in November 1952. Under various designations, the 36th would remain at Bitburg for the next 40 years. In August 1953, the North American F-86F Sabre was introduced to the wing, replacing the F-84s. On 31 March 1954, The 1st Pilotless Bomber Squadron, equipped with the Martom B-61A Matador, was attached to the 36th Fighter Bomber Wing, making it the first operational U.S. missile unit. The 1st eventually was renamed a Tactical Missile Squadron, and in 1958 was replaced by the 71st Tactical Missile Squadron and the unit was assigned to the 701st Tactical Missile Wing, headquartered at Hahn Air Base, although the squadron remained at Bitburg. In August 1954, the wing was redesignated as the 36th Fighter-Day Wing. In 1956, the wing received the North American F-100 Super Sabre, marking the first time a wing in USAFE flew supersonic jets. On 15 May 1958, the 36th FDW was redesignated as the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing, with its squadrons redesignated as tactical fighter squadrons, because its missions had now grown to include delivery of tactical nuclear weapons. In May 1961, the wing received the Republic F-105 Thunderchief. Formal USAFE acceptance of the Mach 2 fighter-bombers was held at the Paris Air Show on 3 June 1961. Deliveries of the F-105D model were completed in 1963, and the 36th carried on its Cold War mission of tactical nuclear weapons delivery. Twice in the early 1960s when Cold War tensions were elevated due to the 1961 Berlin Wall crisis and 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis the 36th rose to a high level of alert. By 1966 the Thud was being phased out of NATO, being replaced by the McDonnell F-4D Phantom II. The tactical nuclear deliver mission, still necessary, was being eclipsed by the ability of ICBMs and the primary mission of the 36th TFW changed to Tactical Air support of NATO ground units in West Germany. By December 1966, all the 36th TFW Thuds had been ferried stateside for combat crew training duties at McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas, or to Southeast Asia after stateside refurbishment. In October 1965, the 36th accepted command of the 71st Tactical Missile Squadron from the inactivated 38th Tactical Missile Wing at Sembach Air Base.36th TFW Special Order AA-84, 29 September 1965 The 36th maintained and operated two hardened launch sites (at Rittersdorf, Site 7, and at Idenheim, site 8) with a total of 16 CGM-13B Mace tactical missiles until 30 April 1969. In September 1969, the 36th TFW took responsibility for Spangdahlem Air Base West Germany until December 1971. By 1976 a major modernization of USAFE was necessary. The Soviet Union's new generation of MiG and Sukhoi fighters made NATO military planners anxious. Indeed, intelligence reports about the MiG-25 left little room for comfort; the performance of this latest Russian combat aircraft was far superior to any NATO aircraft. The twin-engined MiG-25 reached speeds of over 3,000 km/h even at high altitude (over 70,000 feet) and it could be armed with radar-guided AA-6 Acrid air-to- air missiles. When the Soviets stationed large numbers in the Soviet Union and later in the GDR, NATO had to address this problem. The solution was provided by the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. Just like the MiG-25 it has two powerful engines and a double tail fin. The 23 aircraft for the first operational squadron (525th Tactical Fighter Squadron) with the 36th left Langley Air Force Base on 27 April 1977 for a mass Atlantic crossing. Over the following months the aircraft for two other squadrons (23d and 53d Tactical Fighter Squadrons) arrived. The 36th's full strength of 79 fully operational F-15As was reached in December 1977. In 1980 more advanced F-15Cs and F-15Ds would replace the original F-15As. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the 36th conducted routine training missions however the outbreak of the 1990–91 Gulf War put the F-15s of Bitburg into the heart of the conflict. The 36th's pilots and aircraft performed magnificently in Operation Desert Storm. Not a single F-15 aircraft was lost in combat during the war. On 13 March 1991, the deployed squadrons of the 36th returned in victory. The celebration was brief, however, as the 36th deployed back to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey to support Operation Provide Comfort. Between 5 April and 25 May 1991, the 36th flew 285 sorties over Iraq. Just as before, not a single aircraft was lost in Iraq due to hostile fire. On 1 October 1991 the wing was redesignated as the 36th Fighter Wing when the objective wing concept was implemented. The 525th Fighter Squadron was inactivated 31 March 1992 as part of the initial post Cold-War drawdown. Bitburg Air Base was part of the 1993 Base Realignment and Closure (or BRAC) process that saw the drawdown of many military facilities in a series of post-Cold War force reductions. In July 1993, HQ USAFE announced the closure of Bitburg Air Base and the pending inactivation of the 36th Fighter Wing. The 53d Fighter Squadron was transferred without personnel or equipment to the 52d Operations Group at Spangdahlem Air Base. Some squadron aircraft transferred to 22d Fighter Squadron. The 22d Fighter Squadron was also transferred without personnel or equipment to the 52d Operations Group at Spangdahlem Air Base. On 1 October 1994 the 36th Fighter Wing was inactivated and the final 36th Wing Commander, Brigadier General Roger E. Carleton, presented Bitburg Air Base to the German government. =Pacific Air Forces= The wing was reactivated at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam the same day as the 36th Air Base Wing, a non-flying organization taking over as the host unit. The former host unit, the 633d Air Base Wing was inactivated in keeping with the Air Force Chief of Staff's policy of keeping the most highly decorated and longest serving Air Force units on active duty. The wing's combat readiness was tested between December and March 1991 during a deployment to Southwest Asia as part of Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm and Proven Force. While flying combat air patrols during the war, the F-15s of the 36th were a strong deterrent to the air forces of Iraq. During Operation Desert Storm, the 36th was credited with downing 17 enemy aircraft in air-combat engagements. On 1 October 1991, the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing was redesignated the 36th Fighter Wing, and in July 1994, the 36th Fighter Wing was inactivated. The 36th Air Base Wing was activated at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, on 30 September 1994. Under that designation, the wing lived up to its mission several times. In September 1996, the wing provided around-the-clock forward-deployment support to Air Combat Command Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses during their Operation Desert Strike missions over Iraq, and began hosting more than 6,600 Kurdish evacuees during the 8-month humanitarian assistance mission, Joint Task Force Pacific Haven. On 12 April 2006, the 36th Air Base Wing was redesignated as the 36th Wing. Prior to the redesignation, the wing had been using a temporary designation of air expeditionary wing. The change in the wing's official designation was meant to better align Andersen with its mission statement: \\"To provide a U.S.-based lethal warfighting platform for the employment, deployment, reception, and throughput of air and space forces in the Asia-Pacific region.\\" In February 2007, the 36th Operations Group was reactivated as a permanent subordinate unit to the 36th Wing, replacing the temporary 36th Expeditionary Operations Group.

The airmen relented and kept it as a mascot. When the incumbent mascot dies, another is caught from the jungle to take its place.

It was published in 2002 by Cactus Game Design, based in North Carolina. Settlers of Canaan takes place in the ancient land of Canaan, which roughly corresponds to the northern half of present-day Israel. Gameplay Players play the roles of various tribes of Israel which settled in this geographical region. The game progresses very similarly to the Catan: as players expand their settlements throughout the land, they trade resources and make strategic choices to outmaneuver their opponents.  Differences from Catan The most striking difference in the Settlers of Canaan is its fixed playing board. Like with many Catan variants, both the hexagonal land tiles and the numerical disks are printed directly on the board. Also, one land tile, called the \\"copper hex\\" (equivalent to the \\"gold hex\\" in some expansions to Settlers of Catan), allows bordering players to select which resource(s) it produces. Trading ports are scattered along the western coastline, which borders the Great Sea, as well as around the shoreline of the Sea of Galilee, which is surrounded by land tiles. In Settlers of Canaan, the \\"robber\\" is called the \\"plague\\". Moving the robber is referred to as \\"cleansing the plague\\" from a particular land tile, and it has the same effect as in Settlers of Catan. The object of the game is to amass 12 victory points. Current scores are indicated by color-coded markers on the eastern side of the playing board. Victory points are earned by building settlements and cities, by building the longest road, by amassing the most priests (equivalent to knights/soldiers in Settlers of Catan), and by obtaining the \\"King's Blessing\\". If ties exist in competition for either the longest road or the most priests, then the corresponding 2-point bonus is removed from play. The game ends when a player reaches 12 victory points or when the \\"Wall of Jerusalem\\" is completed, whichever comes first. In the latter scenario, the player with the most victory points wins the game. (If two or more players tie, then the winner is the player who has contributed more stones to the Wall of Jerusalem. If a tie exists in this tiebreaker, then gameplay continues until a clear winner emerges.) =The Wall of Jerusalem and the King's Blessing= A player may build a \\"stone for Jerusalem\\" at a cost of one stone resource (called \\"clay\\" in Catan) and one ore resource, during his or her turn under one of two conditions: # The player owns a settlement or city on the southern border of Canaan (west of the Salt Sea), or # Another player owns a settlement or city on the southern border of Canaan, and the current player owns a settlement or city that is connected to the other player's settlement or city by a (multiplayer) trade route. When a player builds a stone for Jerusalem, this stone is immediately placed in the Wall of Jerusalem, an area in the desert south of Canaan which can hold up to 28 such stones. If a player builds a stone using a multiplayer trade route, then that player must pay one resource card of his or her choice to the owner of the trade route's final settlement or city. The player who has contributed the most stones to the Wall of Jerusalem earns the King's Blessing, which is worth 2 victory points and gives that player the privilege of trading a resource of his or her choice at a 2:1 ratio. (This trade benefit is the same as that of the Merchant in Cities and Knights of Catan.) If another player later ties for the most stones in the Wall of Jerusalem, then the King's Blessing is removed from play until someone achieves a singular majority. Every time a 7 is rolled during gameplay, a black stone is added to the Wall of Jerusalem. These stones do not affect the King's Blessing, but they may help bring the end of the game before anyone reaches the required 12 victory points. =Development cards= Many development cards in this game resemble those from Settlers of Catan; several are similar to progress cards from Cities and Knights of Catan. Some, however, are unique to this game. Below is a list of available development cards; the quantity of each type of card is given in parentheses.

History  Alpine was so named because it is on the top of one of the foothills of the Central Oregon Coast Range. It is noted that the \\"situation is not particularly alpine in character\\". Alpine School operated for several years before there was a settlement in the location, thus the community took its name from the school. In 1908, the Corvallis and Alsea River Railway Company began construction of a line that ended in the settlement of Alpine when funding ran out. The community has burned three times since its heyday in the early 1900s. A post office was established in 1912 and operated until 1976. Alpine now has a Monroe mailing address. Alpine Elementary School closed in 2003. When the Alpine Market closed in 2004, the Alpine Tavern (built in 1936) started selling groceries. In 2005, a vintage photograph of the tavern was featured in a Miller Beer advertisement, and the market was due to be razed. As of November 2019, the Alpine Tavern was still a thriving business in the community, preserving area history.

The QLZ-87 is being complemented by the QLZ-04, which is fed from a belt and thus is better suited to be mounted on tripods and vehicles. Development The Chinese military began research into grenade launchers during the 1980s. They started off by examining American weapons captured in the Vietnam War including the 40×46mm single-shot M79 and M203; they were also familiar with the hand-cranked Mk 18, as well as the 40×53mm XM75 and Mk 19. China also obtained samples of the Soviet 30×29mm AGS-17 captured by the Mujahideen during the Soviet–Afghan War. The Hua Dong Industrial Academy’s Mechanical Research Institute, a state-controlled civilian organization that carried out China's AGL development, concluded that such foreign weapons were too large and heavy to be man-portable and did not fit within doctrinal deployment plans for the system. They also had problems with each sides' ammunition; the U.S. grenade's advanced primer ignition (API) operating principle was less reliable than desired, and the Soviet grenade was too small to contain an effective high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead, so the team compromised on a 35 mm cartridge. After five generations of prototypes, the team created a design designated the W87. The W87 featured a roller-delayed blowback operation and fired from a closed bolt for better accuracy. It could be top-loaded from 6- and 9-round box magazines or a 12-round drum magazine. A bipod was included for quick deployment and it could be tripod-mounted. The 35×32mm grenades had an aluminum case and round nose. The W87 and its ammunition were revealed in a presentation at a small arms development conference hosted at Aberdeen Proving Ground in September 1988. After some redesigns, the AGL was accepted into Chinese military service as the QLZ-87 in the mid-1990s. Design Ugandan soldiers of the African Union Mission in Somalia armed with a QLZ-87 in light configuration Type 87 grenade launcher in the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution The QLZ-87 is in fact a derivative of the Type 85 heavy machine gun, featuring a similar tubular steel receiver, direct gas impingement operation, and flap locks (derived from the Degtyarov-Shpagin system featured on the DShK machine gun). It is magazine-fed from 6- or 15-round drums from the bottom; in order to make room for ammunition to be fed from the bottom, the fire selector controls are mounted on the right side and offer safe, semi-automatic, and automatic firing modes. The grenade launcher retains the bipod of the W87 and weighs the same at with an tripod, though the new tripod has articulated legs and a crank elevation adjustment. Its carrying handle is an external part of the bolt group, which is cycled by redirected propellant gas as part of the operating system, but unlike the M16 rifle propellant gasses are not vented into the receiver; it also functions as the charging handle and forward assist. Once the bolt group starts to recoil, remaining gasses are immediately vented outward and spent cases are ejected directly upwards. To manage recoil the weapon has a large, twin-port muzzle brake, thick rubber butt pad, and an internal buffer to the rear of the bolt group, but recoil is still harsh and only semi-automatic fire is viable when not mounted. While American and Russian AGLs are heavy, crew- served tripod-mounted weapons employed at battalion-level, the QLZ-87 in its \\"light\\" configuration can be used by one soldier from the shoulder or bipod as a company-level support weapon. In this configuration it is typically fired semi-automatically and fed from the 6-round drum. In its \\"heavy\\" configuration (which includes the tripod) it is carried by a crew of three, and can make effective use of the 15-round drum and fully automatic fire. Like heavier AGLs it can be pintle-mounted on vehicles, but troop feedback indicates mounted magazine reloading is both difficult, and frequent because of the low ammunition capacity.QLZ87 Weapon Systems. =Ammunition= The 35×32mm grenade was also redesigned for the QLZ-87, giving it a shorter overall length with a tapered, flat nosed projectile housed in a semi-rimmed aluminum case. It weighs roughly the same at and has a slightly faster muzzle velocity of 190 m/s; a 6-round drum weighs empty and loaded, and a 15-round drum weighs empty and loaded. The two most common types of grenades are the DFS87 high explosive (HE), which has a fragmentation warhead with a casualty radius of 10-11 meters, and the DFJ87 high explosive dual purpose (HEDP), which has a shaped charge warhead that can penetrate 80 mm of rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) which striking flat or 35 mm of RHA at a 60° angle with a secondary 5-meter fragmentation casualty radius; though both these rounds have better anti- personnel and armor piercing effects individually than U.S. 40 mm HEDP, their specialization makes them less suited for defeating a different target set, so ammunition type would have to be changed to effectively engage a different target type.35×32mm Type 87 Weapon Systems. Initial production of both models featured a fragmentation liner consisting of small steel balls suspended in a polymer matrix, but later the HE projectile used a pre-fragmented wire coil jacket and the HEDP projectile used a steel upper casing to produce fragments, both for cost savings. They have an inertia-armed fuze in the nose permitting a safe arming distance of 12–30 meters from the muzzle. Other available 35 mm cartridges include the DFR87 incendiary, DFN87 high-explosive incendiary (HEI), and DFD87 smoke. Variants * QLZ-87B/QLB-06: Newer handheld semi- automatic version of QLZ-87.

Such intraventricular hemorrhage can occur due to perinatal asphyxia in preterm neonates.  Presentation  This may lead to various neurological sequelae including presentation with cerebral palsy, mental retardation and seizures.  Pathophysiology  The germinal matrix is the site of proliferating neuronal and glial precursors in the developing brain, which is located above the caudate nucleus, in the floor of the lateral ventricle, and caudothalamic groove. The germinal matrix contains a rich network of fragile thin-walled blood vessels. Hence the microcirculation in this particular area is extremely sensitive to hypoxia and changes in perfusion pressure. It is most frequent before 35 weeks gestation and is typically seen in very low birth-weight (<1500g) premature infants, because they lack the ability for auto regulation of cerebral blood flow. Consequently, increased arterial blood pressure in these blood vessels leads to rupture and hemorrhage into germinal matrix. Diagnosis = Grades = Four grades are distinguished (by imaging or histology): *grade I - hemorrhage is confined to the germinal matrix *grade II - intraventricular hemorrhage without ventricular dilatation *grade III - intraventricular hemorrhage with ventricular dilatation *grade IV - intraventricular rupture and hemorrhage into the surrounding white matter  Prevention  Antenatal corticosteroids have a role in reducing incidence of germinal matrix hemorrhage in premature infants. Management Stem cell- based therapies may help to treat germinal matrix hemorrhage in preterm babies but there is currently no reliable evidence to support their use.
