The work of 1990, which incorporates the harmonization by Praetorius, is one of his signature compositions, along with his Trombone Concerto No. 1, the Motorbike Concerto. Composition Jan Sandstr√∂m composed the work in 1990, one year after the success of his Motorbike Concerto. He took the four-part setting of the Christmas carol Es ist ein Ros entsprungen by Michael Praetorius (1609) as a starting point. Line by line, he placed it in slow motion within an eight-part a cappella setting. Choir I in four parts, singing Praetorius, can be performed by soloists. Choir II in eight parts is hummed throughout. The way of combining a chorale as a cantus firmus with different musical material is similar to chorale preludes, but in this case the cantus firmus is quoted not only in the melody but a full harmonization, and the contrasting music is given to voices. Their humming renders the work suitable for international presentation. The work was first published in 1995 by the Sveriges K√∂rf√∂rbunds F√∂rlag, Stockholm. It is available as a single copy or in the collection Cantemus 3. It is published for the U.S. by Walton Music as \\"Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming / Es ist ein Ros entsprungen\\". It is written in F major in common time with a tempo indication of ‚ô©=56, which is especially slow since Sandstr√∂m has changed the note grades so that this is equivalent to ‚ô©=28 in Praetorius's notation and he uses mainly the longest notes. The voices of choir II enter one after the other within four measures, from the lowest to the highest, starting ppp and gradually increasing to piano. All voices but bass II, which stays on its first note F, move upwards from their first note to a second on which they stay, building up a chord into which choir I enters in measure 5, also ppp to piano and back again on the words \\"\\". The chords in choir II change subtly by voices moving or pausing, carefully supporting the harmonies of Praetorius. Choir II is singing alone for more than a measure before choir I continues \\"aus einer Wurzel zart\\". Selected performances and recordings The composition is a highlight of Christmas programs by ambitious choirs and vocal ensembles. In 2007 it was included in a broadcast from Kings College Chapel on Christmas Eve, with the Choir of King's College, conducted by Stephen Cleobury. Chanticleer performed it in 2007 and then commissioned the composer to write a piece for them for the Christmas season of 2010, which resulted in The Word Became Flesh. In 2010 it was broadcast twice by the BBC in a Choral Evensong from Winchester College. New England Conservatory's Chamber Singers and Concert Choir included the composition in their 2011 Lessons and Carols program. It is on the 2011 Christmas program of the NDR Chor in St. Nikolai. In 2002, the chamber choir Dresdner Kammerchor, conducted by Hans-Christoph Rademann, included it on their CD ', and it was described in a review as an \\"absolutely otherworldly setting ... Praetorius meets Ligeti\\". Performed by the Dale Warland Singers, the composition is part of a 2005 CD Noel ‚Äì A Music Feast, a charitable project which also features \\"Carol of the Bells\\" and \\"Hallelujah\\" from Messiah, sung by the Westminster Choir. In 2009, a CD titled Es ist ein Ros' entsprungen ‚Äì Christmas Music for Choir and Organ combined several settings of the tune, the original by Praetorius, an organ prelude by Johannes Brahms (Op. 122 No. 8), variations on it by Hugo Distler from Die Weihnachtsgeschichte (The Christmas Story, 1933) and Sandstr√∂m's setting, together with related Christmas music, performed by Vox Bona, the chamber choir of the , conducted by Karin Freist-Wissing. Reviewer Dan Morgan commented on Sandstr√∂m's work: \\"From its dark, monastic beginning rising to a radiant, multi-layered crescendo, this is the disc's crowning glory. ... It's an extraordinary fusion of old and new, a minor masterpiece that deserves the widest possible audience.\\" Stefan Schm√∂e compared the \\"schwebende Klangfl√§chen\\" (floating soundscapes) of the added second chorus to an acoustic halo. John Miller describes Sandstr√∂m's addition as a \\"timeless, atmospheric, dream-like sound- scape of poignantly dissonant polyphonic strands\\". In 2011, Es ist ein Ros entsprungen was recorded by the TOWER Voices New Zealand for their CD A Voices Christmas. The Crypt Choir of The King's School, Canterbury included it on the program A Spotless Rose, recommended by the Royal School of Church Music.

The company headquarters are situated in Greenock, Scotland.Companies House extract company no SC027238 McGill's Bus Service Limited The present company was founded in July 2001, restoring the name of a previous operator which had existed between 1933 and 1997. However, there is no connection between the two companies other than their names. The company has grown from an initial fleet of 33 vehicles to operate a network of routes covering much of Inverclyde, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, North Lanarkshire, Glasgow City, and North Ayrshire. A second depot in Barrhead was opened in 2008 but has now closed. Four independent operators were taken over by McGill's in the following three years. McGill's has several depots in Greenock, Coatbridge, Inchinnan, and Johnstone. McGill's took over the surviving operations of Arriva Scotland West in a ¬£10 million deal; this was completed on 26 March 2012, and the company now operates over 450 buses and around 100 routes and employs over 1000 members of staff. Further expansion followed in 2012 and in 2013. McGill's Coaches also bought Henderson Travel after it suddenly ceased business in October 2014, and subsequently took over the company's fleet and service routes which has resulted in the company expanding in North Lanarkshire and becoming the dominant operator in the Monklands area by early 2016. McGills is the largest independent bus operator in Scotland, as well as being named a Scottish Insider top 500 company in January 2016, coming in at 350th place. History Prehistory and early years (1933-2004) The name \\"McGill's Bus Services\\" first came into use in 1933. This company was based in Barrhead and was owned by the McGill family. It expanded significantly during the years leading up to bus deregulation, but in July 1997, sold out to the major operator in the area, Clydeside 2000, in the face of significant competition from independent minibus operators. McGill's initially retained its identity, but was later rebranded as Arriva Scotland West. Another company, Greenock based Ashton Coaches (trading as GMS), was also acquired by Clydeside in the same month. In July 2001, Arriva decided to withdraw from its Inverclyde operations, which were loss-making and was facing significant competition from independent operators. Its Greenock depot was sold to former GMS owner Alex Kean and the Easdale family with each owning 50%. Arriva had retained a separate operating licence for McGill's, and this was used as the basis for the sale. The McGill's Bus Services name was revived by the new company and a new livery of blue, white, and gold was introduced. The fleet initially consisted of 33 Mercedes-Benz minibuses hired from Arriva; services were operated from a large depot on the Easdale Industrial Estate. Early in its existence the new company began operating services in competition with Harte Buses, and in September 2004 Harte withdrew from two routes leaving McGill's as the sole operator. In October 2004, Kean sold his shares in the company to the Easdale family, who quickly replaced the hired minibuses with new low- floor vehicles, leading to increases in passenger numbers. Consolidation & expansion (2005-2015) Between 2005 and 2008, McGill's introduced a number of new longer-distance routes connecting Inverclyde and Glasgow to Largs, and in May 2005, began operating a series of day excursions branded as Smoothiecruisers. In July 2008, McGill's purchased the stage carriage routes and goodwill of four routes centred on Greenock which had previously been run by Slaemuir Coaches. In the same month, the firm established a second depot in Barrhead on the site of the garage used by the original McGill's Bus Services, which had been vacated by Arriva in 2002. The new operation traded as United Buses using Greenock and District Omnibuses'Companies House extract company no SC0211163 Greenock and District Omnibus Limited 'o' licence with vehicles on hire from ABC Taxis,Companies House extract company no SC215370 ABC Taxis (Inverclyde) Limited which also had an 'o' licence, and capitalised on the revocation of the operating licences held by local operator John Walker to move onto four routes previously served by his group of companies. Twenty step-entrance buses were initially used, but these were largely replaced by low-floor vehicles after four months. The United name was replaced by that of McGill's in September 2009; the same month saw the company introducing the express service X23 between Glasgow and Erskine. By the beginning of 2010, McGill's had become the largest independent bus operator in Scotland, and the fourth largest operator of any type. A new service linking Greenock and Larkfield was introduced in early 2010 to replace a route withdrawn by Wilson's Coaches. May 2010 saw McGill's expand its services from Dunoon and Greenock to Braehead to cover for the withdrawal of Harte Buses' Braehead Express. In July 2010, the company was fined ¬£60,000 by the Traffic Commissioner for failing to operate some services as timetabled, although it was permitted to expand its fleet from 110 to 150 vehicles. The Smoothiecrusisers network was withdrawn in August 2010. The company acquired the operations and vehicles of large independent operator Gibson's Direct in September 2010, expanding the size of its fleet by around 70%.McGill's expands in Renfreshire busandcoach.com 6 September 2010 In February 2011, two small operators based in the Paisley area, Fairway Coaches and Travel Direct, were purchased by McGill's, although no vehicles were acquired.McGill's announces further expansion busandcoach 1 November 2010 Two further acquisitions, of Renfrewshire-based Ferenze Travel and Phoenix Travel, were announced in March 2011. In the same month, Dickson's of Erskine sold its key route 38, a Glasgow to Paisley service operated in competition with both Arriva Scotland West and First Glasgow, to McGill's, who converted the route to low-floor operation and increased its frequency at a cost of ¬£1.5 million. In March 2012, McGill's purchased the remaining Arriva Scotland West operation. The sale included 165 vehicles, 380 staff, and depots at Inchinnan and Johnstone. The deal expanded the McGill's a fleet to over 350 buses.Arriva exits Scotland with sale to McGill's busandcoach.com 14 December 2011Mcgill's Bus Services Limited/Arriva Scotland West Limited merger inquiry Competition Commission 21 September 2012 On 15 October 2012, it was announced that McGill's were to acquire the local bus services of Balloch-based McColls Coaches for ¬£3 million, with 30 buses joining the fleet. In June 2013, four new routes in the Paisley area were introduced by the company to replace those of Riverside Transport. In January 2014, McGill's was linked with a bid to operate the 360-bus network on the Mediterranean island of Malta following the end of Arriva's operations there.McGill's Buses eyes Malta transport tender BBC News, 20 January 2014 A month later, the company pulled out of the bid citing a lack of transparency on the part of the island's government.Scots firm scraps bid to run buses after Maltese fail to come up with answers The Herald, 23 February 2014 Back in Scotland, an open-top tour of Inverclyde was introduced in April 2015.Greenock bus firm launches open-top tours Greenock Telegraph Lanarkshire expansion (2016-) In the summer of 2015, the company announced its plans to double in size by 2020. Sandy Easdale said: \\"It's all about growth and now that were moving forward since the Competition Commission it's about growing McGill's. That's the aim - in the next 5 years' double everything. We are looking at expanding in Lanarkshire in the near future and we are in discussions with some smaller companies to be buying them out in the area and that will join into McGill's. But the good thing about it is that every time McGill's grows outside the area it actually employs people in the Greenock Head Office. It's all about employment. It would be easy to move our head office elsewhere but we stay in Greenock and we're great supporters of the local economy. We're concentrating on our own things and growing our business organically.\\" On 20 January 2016, McGill's announced its first acquisition in Monklands area of Lanarkshire, when a deal was reached to purchase the bus routes of McNairn Coaches and JJ Travel for an undisclosed sum. The deal included 14 members of staff and a number of vehicles.http://www.inverclydenow.com/photostream/16249-mcnairn On 2 February 2015, a second acquisition was made with the routes of Arthur's Coaches and D.A.

On 29 August 2016, the company moved premises from a depot in Blantyre Industrial Estate near Hamilton to a new fully refurbished facility in Coatbridge with all services and buses from the Hamilton depot transferring to the new facility. A number of revisions were introduced to the Monklands services from this date improving services and connections for passengers. Ownership and management McGill's Bus Services was initially owned by Alex Kean and the Easdale family with each owning 50%. In October 2004, Kean sold his 50% share to the Easdale family. Managed by brothers James and Sandy Easdale, they also own a number of taxi firms in the Inverclyde region, as well as several non- transport businesses. Former Arriva Scotland West managing director Ralph Roberts joined McGill's in March 2010. General manager Bert Hendry and finance director Graeme Davidson retained their positions, while James Easdale became the firm's chairman. Colin Napier, who had previously worked for Coakley Bus & Coach and McKindless, became the company's area manager for its eastern operations in August 2010. Colin has since been appointed to Head of Operations & Commercial. Fleet Alexander ALX400 bodied Dennis Trident 2 at Glasgow Central station in January 2013 As of January 2013, the fleet consisted of 359 buses.Fleetlists scotbus.com McGill's was formed with a fleet of 33 Mercedes-Benz minibuses hired from their former owner Arriva Scotland West. Many of these vehicles were previously used by Ashton Coaches and were quickly repainted from their previous green and gold or aquamarine colour schemes into the McGill's blue, white, and gold livery. The minibuses began to be replaced following the Easdale family's acquisition of McGill's in 2004, and a large number of new low-floor buses were bought over the following years as the company expanded, initially Dennis Dart SLFs and DAF SB120s. A rare Hispano bodied Volvo B7L was acquired from Arriva Midlands; later deliveries of new vehicles included Alexander Dennis Enviro200 Darts, Alexander Dennis Enviro300s Mercedes-Benz Citaros, Volvo B7RLEs and Scania L94UBs. The United operation in Renfrewshire began in 2008 with second-hand step-entrance Darts; these were quickly replaced by low-floor vehicles, with the depot becoming 100% low-floor by September 2009. A number of Caetano bodied Dart SLFs were bought from Bluestar in 2009 for use on new route X23. A small number of coaches were operated on route 907, which used the Western Ferries service to Dunoon and required vehicles with ferry lift facilities and low rear overhang. An articulated Volvo B7LA was tested as a means of increasing capacity on services to Glasgow in early 2010, but did not prove successful. Double-deck operation was first tried in November 2009, when an Alexander Dennis Enviro400 was briefly used on route X7. Although no such vehicles were purchased, the trial prompted the company to buy two Volvo B7TLs from London United in autumn 2010 for use on the same route. These were quickly followed by 12 Alexander bodied Dennis Tridents new to Metroline in London. Modern vehicles inherited into the fleet following the purchase of Arriva Scotland West included six Scania OmniLink and ten VDL SB200/Wright Pulsar. In July 2012, six articulated Mercedes-Benz Citaros were acquired for service 38. A further eight Tridents arrived from London United, along with a batch of at least ten from Stagecoach London. The number of low floor double deck vehicles introduced to the fleet since the purchase of Arriva stands at around 40. Along with an unknown number of further Mercedes-Benz Citaros articulated buses for the Dumbarton area - Glasgow services, these continue to displace elderly vehicles from the former Arriva fleet. In 2014 McGill's purchased one of the Alexander Dennis Enviro 400s that they had trialled back in 2009, which had been operated by Connex of Jersey before the purchase. Thirteen new Mercedes-Benz Citaros were also acquired for the Glasgow to Greenock routes. In late 2015, the company bought eight second-hand DAF double deckers from Ensign. In 2016, McGill's purchased a large number of second hand Alexander Dennis Enviro 200s to operate their new Lanarkshire network. This was complemented by a Wright StreetLite, two BMCs, and a number of Optare Solos which were added to the fleet as a result of the acquisition of Silverdale Coaches. The company has also added a further three second hand Wright StreetLites to the Greenock depot and is awaiting delivery of two Mellor Coachcraft Strata vehicles which are to be operated by Greenock depot.

Retrieved 14 July 2020. In 2011, Turek and Hitchens debated the topic of atheism or theism best explaining reality. Views In the book I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist, Geisler and Turek think American culture demands truth from doctors, stock brokers, loved ones, etc., and yet does not typically demand truth when it comes to morality or religion. Geisler and Turek argue that truth is based in correspondence to an absolute reality, and is therefore not subjective. On this basis, Geisler and Turek argue it therefore follows that religious truth is also objective, and for one to claim \\"All truth is relative!\\" or \\"There are no absolutes!\\" is self-refuting. After arguing for the objectivity of truth, Geisler and Turek argue for the objectivity of knowledge. Geisler and Turek ask those who argue that one cannot know anything for sure if they can know that for sure. If the proponent is sure, the statement presented is therefore self-refuting. If the proponent is not sure, the presented argument collapses. Geisler and Turek conclude that people cannot be skeptics about everything, as the proponent would logically have to doubt skepticism: the more one doubts skepticism, the more certain they become. Geisler and Turek argue the existence of God implies the possibility of miracles. By using an illustration of an open box as a metaphor for the universe, Geisler and Turek argue that the universe is effectively open for the creator of the universe (God, the \\"box top\\") to reach in and perform what one might call miracles. Marriage Turek argues in Correct, Not Politically Correct: How Same-sex Marriage Hurts Everyone that marriage lengthens lifespans of men and women, civilizes men, protects women, protects mothers, lowers welfare costs, and encourages a replacement birth rate, and he argues that same-sex marriage does none of these. After a student in a leadership seminar Turek taught in 2010 at Cisco discovered his views on marriage and reported them to the company's human resources department, Turek lost his position as consultant for Cisco. Bank of America also cancelled a seminar presentation for the same reason. Bibliography Turek's co-authored book Legislating Morality: Is It Wise? Is It Legal?

It depicts a story from the Bible, wherein Potiphar's Wife attempts to seduce Joseph. It is signed and dated \\"Rembrandt f. 1634\\" (f. for fecit or \\"made this\\"), and exists in two states.Schwartz, B 39 Description According to the Book of Genesis 39:1‚Äì20, Joseph was bought as a slave by the Egyptian Potiphar, an officer of the Pharaoh. Potiphar's Wife tried to seduce Joseph, who eluded her advances. As Joseph repelled her attempt to lure him into her bed, she grabbed him by his coat: \\"And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within. And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out\\" (Genesis 39: 11‚Äì12).British Museum Citing his garment as evidence, Potiphar's wife falsely accused Joseph of having assaulted her, and he was sent to prison. Rembrandt's etching is a dramatic presentation of the moment Potiphar's wife grabs the fleeing Joseph. Considered \\"unprecedented in its erotic candor\\",Perlove, Silver, 99 it shows Joseph averting his eyes from the frankly depicted nude lower body of his master's wife. Only an etching of 1600 by Antonio Tempesta had portrayed a comparable sexual aggressiveness.Perlove, Silver, 99 Despite compositional similarities to the Tempesta, Rembrandt's depiction of human emotions‚ÄîJoseph's revulsion and the desperation of Potiphar's wife‚Äîis unique to him, and the work is more blunt in its suggestion of the woman's physical appetite.British MuseumPerlove, Silver, 99Fitzwilliam, 6 As in his 1638 etching of Adam and Eve, the explicit depiction of the female's vulva is unusual, and emphasizes the seductress's lasciviousness; a persistent notion from antiquity to 17th century Holland was that a woman's genitals hungered insatiably for the male's seed.Sluijter, 287 Of some 300 etchings that Rembrandt produced, Joseph and Potiphar's Wife was one of only four or five that may be classified as erotica; these prints were not widely disseminated during his life.Rohleder The original copper plate of Joseph and Potiphar's Wife, on loan to the Rembrandthuis. A context for Rembrandt's unidealized interpretation of the nude was proposed by Kenneth Clark, who noted that the artist's female figures from the early 1630s marked a break with the abundant exuberance of his contemporary, Peter Paul Rubens, and were at stark contrast with the classicism of the conventional nude.Clark, 338‚Äì340 Rembrandt's etchings offered a \\"defiant truthfulness\\", as well as a sense of pity for physical imperfections, the fat and wrinkles of the human body.Clark, 338‚Äì340 Rembrandt may have intended moral implications in the dramatic use of light and shadow, with Joseph seen radiantly illuminated on the left side of the print and Potiphar's wife surrounded by the darkness of her bedchamber on the right.British MuseumFitzwilliam, 6 The rich tonal quality Rembrandt achieved in early etchings like Joseph and Potiphar's Wife was produced by his building dark areas with multiple overlays of hatched lines, gained through repeated work on successive states of the print.Ward, 204 The original printing plate survives in a private collection. The changes between the two states are minor, with some extra touches being added to the bed and bedding.British Museum Rembrandt made etchings of two earlier episodes in Joseph's story, in B 37 (1638) and B 38 (c. 1633), which are similar sizes but in a vertical \\"portrait\\" format.Schwartz, under those numbers.

A 2016 economic study found a dramatic positive benefit of the SFpark Project: subsequent price changes squeeze more blocks into the target occupancy range of 60‚Äì80%, reducing the number of blocks with very high or very low occupancy rates as well as, more generally, the number of blocks not meeting occupancy goals. The study notes that this finding does not mean that the occupancy rate on any particular block is more stable but rather that overall variability in occupancy rates across blocks decreases, on average, through performance-based price changes. If individuals can more reliably and quickly find parking spaces (i.e. if target occupancy rates are met more frequently on aggregate), then each vehicle trip does not need to be padded with additional travel time to \\"cruise\\" for a vacant space.

His family later moved to Garden Grove, California. He was first musically inspired by clarinetist Benny Goodman at age six or seven, and was also inspired by Charlie Parker. \\"One of the first records that I really liked was Charlie Parker with Strings, the way he soared over the orchestra...\\" Ranier took up piano at age ten, studying the classical repertoire, and added clarinet at 12. He has said he did not pursue a concert piano career because, \\"After hearing Benny, I always wanted to play jazz.\\" While a student at Santiago High School, Ranier worked with his father (Lou Ranier) on gigs and studied arranging with the noted writer Jack Daugherty. After high school Ranier studied music at California State University, Fullerton where he received a B.A. in Music Composition in 1972; he also studied with Kalman Bloch on clarinet and Lloyd Rogers in composition.

He has gone on to work with the Terry Gibbs-Buddy DeFranco Sextet, George Coleman, Lew Tabackin, Eddie Daniels, Lanny Morgan and a long list of other jazz musicians. Live jazz performance and the art of improvising is important to Ranier: \\"it's a combination of both thinking and feeling...(the) music is complex enough that there is a lot of thought going on...you're trying to project something, listening from deep within you.\\" Ranier's list of studio work for television, movies, and entertainment is quite extensive, including The Young and the Restless (1986),IMDB, listing for Ranier television credits, acting-musician Noises Off (1992), Matlock, Diagnosis: Murder, Trial and Error (1997), Letters from a Killer (1998), and Sideways (2004).

Later, in London, he took portraits of famous artists, and worked on a book about Mesopotamian artifacts in the Louvre and the British Museum. He and his wife went back to Argentina in 1936. That year, he was commissioned to photograph Buenos Aires for its 400th anniversary, and produced streetscapes that captured the romance, vitality and squalor of a great city.

The Masonic Hall is a contributing property in the Ferndale Main Street Historic District which was added on 10 January 1994 to the National Register of Historic Places. Ferndale Masonic Lodge F & A. M. #193 holds meetings in the building. History Charter member and first worshipful master of the Ferndale Lodge for two terms in 1869 and 1870, Seth Louis Shaw (March 23, 1816 ‚Äì November 23, 1872), was a lifelong Mason, starting in Nashville, Tennessee, where he became a master Mason and later worshipful master of the same lodge. After traveling to California in the Gold Rush, Shaw was one of the charter members of the Humboldt Lodge in Eureka, California before the founding of the Ferndale Lodge. The Ferndale lodge was chartered on 14 October 1869 by the grand lodge in San Francisco. The earliest meetings of the Ferndale Lodge were held over a store at the corner of Ocean Avenue and Francis Street, now the site of an abandoned gas station. In 1872 Shaw's son, Joseph Armitage Shaw, was worshipful master of the Ferndale Lodge. In 1874 and 1875, the Lodge worked on building a new hall which is now the I.O.O.F. Hall on Main Street. The most disastrous fire in the town's history, on 6 and 7 September 1875, burned both the store and the hall. All that survived was a ledger and one minute book from 1874. The new hall building that was being built, escaped the flames, but in 1876 they found the cost of the new building too much and sold a half- interest to the Odd Fellows. The new Masonic Hall The new Masonic Temple built by Ira Russ and members of the lodge in 1891 was described as \\"a structure of magnificent proportions, and modern architecture.\\" The upper floor was used for meetings, the lower floor was rented out for various purposes. The Ferndale Lodge sold the remaining half-interest in their old hall to the Odd Fellows in 1891. In March 1895, the first floor was used by the Ferndale kindergarten. In 1896 a side addition to the hall was built by Blakemore and Briggs. Two years later, the Ferndale Commercial School opened on 22 August 1898 in what was then called the Town Hall in the Masonic Building. In August 1899, Ferndale's first high school started in the council rooms at the Masonic Building, and in 1901 the Ferndale Business College opened on the Eugene Street side of the Hall. The building was twisted out of shape and all the lower story plastering knocked loose in the 24 April 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Repairs were undertaken immediately and in September 1907, all the first floor rooms were combined into one and a kitchen was added by P.R. Burris and Ira Goff. In 1914 another kindergarten opened in the hall. In early 1928 the hall was extensively remodeled, and repaired again in 1992 after the earthquakes.

Born at East Marden in South Australia to Thomas James and Emily, n√©e Pitt, he received a sketchy education and after studying at the Muirden College for Business Training joined his father's fruit business Trevarno, which he and his brother took over in 1910. He married Rachel May Scarborough on 19 October 1910 at Glenelg. After a financial disaster during World War I when the brothers were left out of pocket after shipping a quantity of fruit to Germany, they dissolved the partnership and Frederick established new orchards at Berri, successfully dealing in dried fruit from 1920. He stayed out of the Australian Dried Fruits Association in protest at the restrictive sale rules. During this period he also gained extensive familiarity with Australia's Constitution. In 1925 James successfully sold large quantities of his export quota to New Zealand, but his contracts were annulled when he tried to repeat his feat the following year. He successfully had his quota raised, but on the advice of a solicitor sold more than double his quota to brokers in New South Wales and Victoria, resulting in the South Australian Dried Fruits Control Board initiating legal proceedings against him. The High Court ruled in favour of James, as it was often to do, in James v. South Australia (1927). He was also successful in James v. The Commonwealth (1928), but the court ruled against him in James v. Cowan (1930), upholding the state's right to invoke compulsory acquisition; this was reversed by the Privy Council in 1932. James was involved in many significant legal cases in the 1930s and won most of them. Originally a Country Party member, he left when it embraced organized marketing and, after an unsuccessful attempt to gain United Australia Party preselection, ran for the Senate in 1937 on an independent ticket, winning 7.9% of the vote. In 1936 his wife initiated divorce proceedings but James persuaded her to settle out of court. She died in 1949 and he remarried Constance Winifred Timothy-Keighley on 19 April 1950.

Over many years this building was used by Argentine exploration expeditions to the area. On 3 March 1977, seeking to strengthen the Argentine sovereign presence over Antarctica and specifically, the expansion of scientific studies on the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, a task force of the Argentine Army settled in Primavera Cape. Lieutenant Colonel Ignacio Carro and eight men under his command expanded the Capit√°n Cobbett refuge, setting up all the facilities needed to support the Argentine Antarctic Institute‚Äìcommissioned scientists. Such buildings included two small houses, a basic bathroom and a deposit. A freezing chamber, two shelters, power plant and radio station were added later. As a secondary mission the small expedition carried out detailed meteorological and glaciological observations. Since 1982 the base is activated only during the austral summer campaigns. Description Formed by a large granite massif, the steep promontory where Primavera lies on benefits from a microclimate that favors both human activity and the development of rich flora and fauna: * On ice-free places, lichens, mosses and some small grasses grow in layers. * Ninety percent of all Antarctic animal species can be spotted in the bay, among them: ** A wide variety of large cetaceans (blue, finned, southern right, orcas, sperm whales, etc.) ** A wide variety of pinnipeds (fur, crab- eater, leopard, elephant, Weddell seals, etc.) ** Many different large sea birds (petrels, skuas, gulls, terns, Antarctic pigeons, cormorants, etc.) The base is located within a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) as designated by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR). Primavera is only inhabited during summer, and has 11 buildings for housing a maximum of 17 people, a crew usually made up by a staff of 6 Argentine scientists, 4 invited foreign ones and 7 army personnel. Some of the base's critical facilities are the main house, dining room, heliport, infirmary, power plant, vehicle fleet, laboratory, workshop (mechanical, carpentry) and deposits. The heliport is only usable during summer. The main activities at the base are centered on area logistics; general maintenance of domestic buildings, neighboring shelters, and search and rescue capabilities; support for scientific activities, medical and meteorological expeditions, nearby bases, and ships and aircraft, both local and foreign. Scientific activities Some of the scientific research programs locally carried out include limnology, ornithology, study of mosses and lichen species and their ecological impact. Climate Owing to the mild microclimate within the bay, the maximum and minimum temperatures range between the relatively moderate and . Similarly, recorded wind speeds average blowing mostly from the northwest.

It is located on Observatorio Island, Melchior Islands, Dallmann Bay, in Palmer Archipelago on Bellingshausen Sea, Antarctic Peninsula. It is Argentina's second historical Antarctic base, after the 1904 establishment of the Orcadas Naval Detachment, the world's first‚Äîand oldest‚Äîpermanent settlement in Antarctica. Melchior is one of 13 research bases in Antarctica operated by Argentina. From 1947 to 1961 it served as a permanent base; since then it is open during the summer season only. History In January 1942 the Argentine Navy transport ARA Primero de Mayo, commanded by then Frigate Captain Alberto J. Oddera, departed from Buenos Aires with the mission of studying the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, especially the area of the Melchior and Argentine Islands. In the former the expedition built a lighthouse and daybeacon. The archipelago was visited again the following year to continue with the cartographic work and to do maintenance duties on the lighthouse. Three years later, in 1946, the National Antarctic Commission sponsored a new exploration trip. This new expedition sailed away from the continent in January 1947, led by then Frigate Captain Luis M. Garc√≠a. It was made up of the light transports Patagonia and Chaco, the patrol ships ARA King and ARA Murature, the tanker Ministro Ezcurra and the whaler Don Samuel. The expedition arrived in Observatorio Island on the last day of 1947, and set up a hydrographic camp and basic astronomical observatory at Punta Gallows. It took 47 days of labor to dynamite the rock, lay down the groundwork for the radio antennae and build the main house: a semi-prefabricated building long and wide, with thermally insulated double walls and ceilings. It had a water boiler, two power generators, batteries and several radio transmitters. Two high antennae made possible to communicate with Buenos Aires through radio telegraphy. They also erected four towers for the per side rhombic antenna. The crew unloaded of equipment and supplies, including of coal, a difficult operation due to the high waves and lack of landing beaches. On 31 March 1947 the construction was finished. Patagonia was forced to leave the area as ice began to cover the seas. A brief farewell ceremony was held at the foot of the mast, where Captain Garc√≠a handed command of the new facilities over to Lieutenant Juan A. Nadaud. In 1952 Melchior became the main source for Antarctic weather forecasts, broadcasting reports three times per day. Larger astronomic facilities were inaugurated in 1955; later, during the 1957‚Äì58 International Geophysical Year, the first automatic tide gauge in Antarctica was installed at the base. On 30 November 1961 Melchior was demoted to summer-only base. In the austral summer campaign of 1962‚Äì63 four Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum scientists conducted marine biology research. Since the summer season of 1968‚Äì69 the facilities have been periodically used for this scientific discipline, under commission of the Argentine Naval Hydrographic Service. Description Melchior is located from Ushuaia, the nearest port city. the base is composed of 4 buildings which can house a maximum crew of 36. It has a basic infirmary of attended by a paramedic. Climate The mean annual temperature at Melchior is . The absolute maximum temperature recorded was on 30 January 1950, while the absolute minimum was , on 9 August 1958.

Biography Rydge was born in Sydney to blacksmith William Henry Rydge and Margaret, n√©e McSweeney. He attended Woollahra Superior Public School and Fort Street Boys' High School before becoming a clerk in the Master of Lunacy's Office in February 1916. In 1918 he left the public service and became an accountant, publishing a book in 1921 on federal income tax and another on the Sydney stock exchange. He had become associate of the Commonwealth Institute of Accountants by 1924. He married Alys Noad, a musician, on 3 July 1926 at Ashfield; that year he also served as mayor of Canterbury. He also became involved in the hotel business, running the Carlton Hotel on Castlereagh Street from 1925 and becoming chairman of Usher's Metropolitan Hotel Ltd, the Pacific Hotel and Mockbell's Ltd. In 1936 he became managing director of Menzies Hotel in Melbourne and also directed Waldas Shoes Ltd. In 1928 he established Rydge's Business Journal. He became a significant stock market figure through his company Carlton Investments Ltd. After 1936 he entered the cinema business, becoming managing director of Greater J. D. Williams Amusement Co.

History  The Darmst√§dter und Nationalbank was formed in 1922 from the merger of the Darmst√§dter Bank f√ºr Handel und Industrie and the Nationalbank f√ºr Deutschland. Former building of the Darmst√§dter Bank f√ºr Handel und Industrie in Darmstadt The Darmst√§dter Bank f√ºr Handel und Industrie (often called Darmst√§dter Bank) was founded as the Bank f√ºr Handel und Industrie by Gustav von Mevissen and Abraham Oppenheim with a capital of 25 million guilders and modelled after the French bank Cr√©dit Mobilier. It received a banking concession on 2 April 1853.Brockhaus' Kleines Konversations-Lexikon, f√ºnfte Auflage, Band 1. Leipzig 1911., S. 149., downloaded on 1 April 2009 It was thus the second universal bank in Germany founded as a company limited by shares (Aktiengesellschaft), after the A. Schaaffhausen'scher Bankverein. In 1873 the bank moved its headquarters to Berlin, having opened a branch there in 1871. Further branches were opened in Stettin (1900), Hannover (1901), D√ºsseldorf, Munich and Nuremberg (1910). In 1913, the Darmst√§dter Bank took over the Breslauer Disconto-Bank, and during the inflation years between 1918 and 1921, it opened many more branches across Germany.  Danat-Bank  Berlin 1925, The headquarters of the ‚ÄûDarmst√§dter und Nationalbank\\" at Schinkelplatz Nr. 1‚Äì4 Rush of savers from the Berliner Sparkasse at M√ºhlendamm after the collapse of the Danatbank on 13th July 1931 In 1920/1921, the Darmst√§dter Bank f√ºr Handel und Industrie and the Nationalbank f√ºr Deutschland formed the bank union Darmst√§dter-Nationalbank Berlin. Both banks assumed a joint guarantee of capital and reserves of over 1 billion marks. The merger was fully completed in 1922, resulting in one of the largest commercial banks in Germany. By 1931 Danatbank had become the second largest bank in Germany, when it suffered a run which started around 17 June due to rumours of the insolvency of the Norddeutsche Wollk√§mmerei & Kammgarnspinnerei (North German Wool and Worsted Yarn Spinning Works), finally going bankrupt on 13 July 1931. It was thus one of the most prominent victims of Deflation in Germany during the Great Depression. The collapse of Danatbank triggered a loss of confidence in the German banking system, and loosed a wave of withdrawals from all other banks beginning the German Banking Crisis. In reaction, the government announced a Bank Holiday starting on 13 July, imposed further capital controls and forced the merger of Danatbank with Dresdner Bank.

Fisher was born in South Melbourne to serving Prime Minister Andrew Fisher and Margaret Jane, n√©e Irvine. The Fishers moved to London in 1915 when Andrew became Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. John was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and returned to Melbourne in 1930 as a cadet for Keith Murdoch's Herald. In 1934 Fisher was appointed publicity manager for the visit of Czechoslovakian communist Egon Erwin Kisch, who was prohibited from entering Australia by the federal government (Kisch was to speak at a congress of the Movement Against War and Fascism). Fisher was involved in having the ban overturned and returned with Kisch to Europe in March 1935, helping to translate Kisch's Australian Landfall into English. In 1935 Fisher settled in Moscow, where he worked on The Moscow News and wrote for International Literature. He travelled frequently to Brussels, London and Berlin and supported the Republicans in Spain, helping organise Australian support for the Spanish Republicans. He was assistant foreign editor for the Labor Daily and the communist Tribune until it was banned in May 1940. He unsuccessfully ran for Labor Party preselection for his father's old seat of Wide Bay, and at the 1940 federal election ran as a State Labor Party candidate for Hume, winning 4.9% of the vote. On 19 August 1941 he married Hansard stenographer Elizabeth Skelton in Sydney. On 6 June 1942 Fisher left for Vladivostok to become the ABC's war correspondent in Moscow, broadcasting until 1943. After the war he moved to Prague, where he was a freelance journalist; he was expelled from Czechoslovakia in 1949 and moved to London. He and his wife separated and would divorce in 1959; Fisher returned to Sydney in 1954. He applied for a United Nations position in the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation but was blocked by unfavourable government reports.

The avenue had large truck traffic due to the export flow flowing through the Port of Santos, however, after August 2010, the movement of such vehicles on the road was restricted to the nighttime due to the conclusion of the south section of the Rodoanel M√°rio Covas (see below).

History Kiddington Hall was built in 1673, and in the 18th century \\"Capability\\" Brown laid out the gardens. The Reverend Thomas Warton, a fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, who was rector of Kiddington for 20 years and poet laureate from 1785, pictures the coming of spring on the estate in his April Ode with \\"swallows skimming the village green and rooks swarming in the oak trees round the manor house\\". Estate owner Sir George Browne provided the real-life inspiration for \\"Sir Plume of amber snuff-box justly vain\\" in Alexander Pope‚Äôs The Rape of the Lock. In 1840 the estate passed to Mortimer Ricardo, youngest son of the political economist David Ricardo. In 1850 he commissioned the architect Sir Charles Barry to remodel the house in his trademark Italianate architecture style, build a new stable courtyard adjoining the hall to the north, and create formal terraced gardens to the south and west, overlooking Brown's park. Barry rebuilt the house so completely that no external trace of the original building is visible. Beyond the Victorian orangery to the south, a gate leads to the square-towered 14th-century church of St Nicholas, where stained-glass windows commemorate the former High Sheriff of Oxfordshire Henry Lomax Gaskell and his wife, Alice, whose family lived at the Hall from 1855 to 1953. In 1950 Lawrence Robson, founder of accountancy company Robson Rhodes, rented Kiddington Hall, and then bought it in 1953. From here he and his wife Inga-Stina Robson worked on his unsuccessful candidature for the Liberal Party in Banbury at the 1950 general election. The house was used as a conference centre and was popular for Liberal Party events. In the run-up to the 1955 general election, Lawrence was the Liberals' prospective candidate in Eye, but he was appointed to a government commission and withdrew. This left Inga-Stina to contest the seat, but she was not successful. On the death of Sir Lawrence in 1982, his son Maurice Robson inherited the house. In September 2009 Maurice placed the entire Kiddington Estate on the market for ¬£42 million, his divorce seemingly being the reason for the sale. Socialite and model Jemima Khan bought Kiddington Hall in Autumn 2010 for a reported ¬£15 million. The property received refurbishment, which was completed in 2012. Structure The house is built of pale, honey-coloured Cotswold stone. The entrance and staircase lead to five main reception rooms, which include: a Rococo-style drawing room; a morning room; a richly decorated dining room with twin columns and carved marble fireplace; a library with its Neoclassical friezes; and a panelled billiards room that overlooks the gardens. The main 18th-century staircase leads to two bedroom suites, seven further bedrooms and three bathrooms on the first floor. The back stairs lead to the second floor and 10 attic rooms. The hall and its adjoining orangery are listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England, and Kiddington Park is also listed Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

Early life Swarn Noora was born to acclaimed Sufi singer, Bibi Noora. Her family hailed from Lyalpur (now Faisalabad) in present-day Pakistan. Career Her family belonged to Lyalpur in present-day Pakistan but they moved to India at the time of partition and Swarn Noora was born close to Amritsar. She is a nationally acclaimed singer of the Sufiyana Qalam, though she regards her late husband Sohan Lal to be her real Ustaad (Teacher). She was interested in singing even as a little girl, but her mother did not consider it a fit line for her daughter and didn't encourage her to train professionally. She was married at the age of twenty one and though her husband also belonged to a family of singers who regularly did professional programs, mostly of Qawwali, she would never go with them. She says that she fell seriously ill with an inexplicable illness and it is then that her husband, having tried all kinds of medicines and failed, asked her what she really was sad about. She then expressed her desire to sing professionally. He immediately agreed and began to train her to sing with a dholak and a tabla, to equip her to perform in front of audiences. That was the beginning of her journey into professional singing and she hasn't looked back since. Her husband died a few years after, she then sang with her son, Dilbahar, who accompanied her in vocals and on the harmonium. Her eldest son, Gulshan, is a composer and has set many of the compositions she sang to tune and the second son, Gulzar, is a dholak player.http://www.beatofindia.com/arists/bsn.htm Her first album was released by beatofindia.com, a folk music promotion group. Her vocals for this album led to many producers around the world using Nooran's voice sample in their songs. She is based in Jalandar, India.

The sermon itself was written as Luther directly addressing his audience. It stresses good works and sincere repentance over indulgences, with Luther criticizing indulgences as non-scriptural and the Catholic clergy as being greedy and wasting money on St. Peter's Basilica when it could be better spent on the poor in their own neighbourhoods.‚ÄùThe Word made flesh: a history of Christian thought‚Äù, by Margaret Ruth Miles, p.249.‚ÄùLuther‚Äù, Volume 1, by John Osborne, p.372.\\"Information revolutions in the history of the West\\", Leonard Dudley.

Luther wrote the sermon in German, unlike his 95 Theses (written in Latin), and avoided regional vocabulary to ensure that his words were intelligible across all Germanic lands.

Syndrome of Finger Agnosia, disorientation for right and left, Agraphia, and Acalculia. Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry 44 (1940): 398‚Äì408. Causes Lesions to the left angular gyrus are associated with finger agnosia, as well as the other symptoms of Gerstmann Syndrome, also known as Angular Gyrus Syndrome. In a study by Rusconi et al., repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was used in healthy individuals to simulate finger agnosia. Stimulation to the intraparietal sulcus, supramarginal gyrus, as well as the left and right angular gyrus and posterior parietal areas caused difficulties in naming, recognizing, and distinguishing fingers.Rusconi, E, Walsh, V., Butterworth, B. Dexterity with numbers: rTMS over Left Angular Gyrus disrupts finger gnosis and number processing. Neuropsychologia 43 (2005): 1609‚Äì624. Attributes Patients with finger agnosia may have difficulty selectively moving fingers, regardless if it is by command or imitation. Others show an inability to name or point to others' fingers, or to show the same finger on the opposite hand. Persons with finger agnosia are able to name and point to a finger when able to use visual guidance, but will have more errors than a person without the disorder. When their own hand is out of sight and they are asked to name a finger that was touched, they are unable to do so and perform at chance. Without Gerstmann syndrome Although it is a necessary component of Gerstmann's syndrome, cases of finger agnosia alone have been reported. Della Sala et al. reported a woman with a stroke in the left subcortical posterior parietal area who had only finger agnosia a year and a half later.Della Sala, S, and Spinnler, H. Finger Agnosia: fiction or reality? Archives of Neurology 51.5 (1994): 448‚Äì50. Acalculia  There is a strong link between acalculia and finger agnosia. Early in development, calculation begins with our fingers. The order that we use when we count with our finger is very specific and it is found in a variety of different cultures. The use of a base ten number system is also found in many cultures. Gerstmann believed that it was no coincidence the word digit means both a finger and any numeral.Gerstmann, J. Syndrome of Finger Agnosia, disorientation for right and left, Agraphia, and Acalculia. Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry 44 (1940): 398‚Äì408. Rusconi et al. suggested that these two conditions co-occur because they are close in cortical territory. In their 2005 study with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), they noted both finger agnosia and acalculia in the test subjects when areas of the intraparietal sulcus were stimulated. They concluded that the areas underlying finger agnosia and acalculia are extremely close to one another, but distinct. These areas receive blood from the same branch of the middle cerebral artery. Any damage to that blood supply would cause symptoms of both acalculia and finger agnosia.Rusconi, E, Walsh, V., Butterworth, B. Dexterity with numbers: rTMS over Left Angular Gyrus disrupts finger gnosis and number processing. Neuropsychologia 43 (2005): 1609‚Äì624. Treatment and prognosis As in many other agnosias, those with the disorder have difficulty recognizing their errors and often do not correct themselves. There is no known treatment for finger agnosia. Typically, finger agnosia does not present difficulties in daily life. In most cases, visual guidance can help with any difficulty in distinguishing or moving the appropriate finger.

His recent work on branched chain fatty acids is particularly noteworthy. He showed, for example, that in cows fed grass silage the phytanic acid found in their plasma lipids originates from chlorophyll. He then went on to discover other novel branched-chain acids in sheep fed carbohydrate-rich diets. These compounds are of great significance arising, as they do, from excess propionate produced by rumen fermentation. This occurs because the conversion of propionate into methylmalonyl-Coenzyme A (a vitamin B-12 - dependent reaction) is rate-limiting and hence the ability of the animal to channel propionate into the tricarboxylic acid cycle is considerably reduced. This work opens up a completely new field of lipid biochemistry. \\" The 55th International Conference on the Bioscience of Lipids, will be held in his memory.

Ross Sea accident On 16 December 2011 the Sparta sent out a distress signal after it struck a submerged iceberg while fishing for Antarctic cod in the Ross Sea. The accident left the vessel holed below the waterline and sinking close to the Ross Ice Shelf and approximately south-east of New Zealand. The Royal New Zealand Air Force twice sent Hercules aircraft on seven-hour flights from Christchurch to air-drop equipment. (The planes had to refuel at McMurdo Station in Antarctica before returning to base.) The air- drops allowed the 32-man crew to pump out the flooded hold, make temporary repairs and stabilise the listing ship. Pack ice meant nearby vessels such as the Norwegian Seljevaer and the Sparta's Russian sister ship Chiyo Maru 3 were unable to come to Sparta's aid. The crew of the Sparta, made up of 16 Indonesians, 15 Russians and a Ukrainian researcher, had to wait until 26 December 2011 when the South Korean icebreaker RV Araon arrived. One of the Araon's first tasks was to pump fuel into the raised side of the Sparta, thus lifting the damaged hull and exposing it to the air. Sparta was stuck for 12 days before repairs could be made and it could head for safety in Port Nelson, New Zealand. With the ship's fate in the balance, biologist David Ainley had criticised the system of fishing permits that allowed \\"underpowered, single- hulled boats\\" to operate in the area and the costs involved in rescuing them. Ecologist Alexei Knishkikov added his concern for local marine wildlife, should any of the Sparta's 200 tons of light fuel oil leak into the sea.

While still in school, he joined the Deutschv√∂lkischer Jugendbund. He studied modern history at the University of Munich, receiving his doctorate in 1928. In 1929, he worked at the Volksbibliothek in Breslau and became involved in library policy in line with a Nazi outlook.Siegfried Schliebs, \\"Der Fall des Volksbibliothekars Wolfgang Herrmann\\" in: Akademie der K√ºnste (Publ.) Das war ein Vorspiel nur... B√ºcherverbrennung Deutschland 1933. Voraussetzungen und Folgen. Berlin (1983), p. 442ff. In 1931, he went to work at the Stettin municipal library, lasting only months in the position before he was let go in October. Also in 1931, he applied for admission into the Nazi Party, where he was aligned with the party's left wing under brothers Gregor and Otto Strasser. In 1933, at the age of 29, he headed the Zentralstelle f√ºr das deutsche Bibliothekswesen in Berlin. In April 1934, he became the library director in K√∂nigsberg, Prussia. In 1936, he became the political leader.Weidermann 2008, Einleitung (PDF)  Book lists  In April 1933, after the Nazis seized power, a committee met in Berlin to establish a \\"new order\\" for Berlin public libraries. Herrmann was a member of the committee. For several years, he had already been preparing lists of literature to weed out, which he brought to the new committee. Herrmann's first lists served to indicate works that libraries should refrain from lending. However, he also had lists of books to recommend, such as Hitler ‚Äì ein deutsches Verh√§ngnis by Ernst Niekisch and Adolf Hitler, Wilhelm der Dritte by Weigand von Miltenberg (pen name of Herbert Blank), but set little store with Hitler's Mein Kampf. As a result, shortly after the book burnings, the Nazi Party press treated him negatively. At the beginning of 1933, the German student organization, the Deutsche Studentenschaft (DSt) asked Herrmann to make his blacklist of \\"harmful and undesirable literature\\" available to them; it then became the foundation for the book burnings.Anselm Faust, \\"Die Hochschulen und der \\"undeutsche Geist.

Hanser, Munich 1983. pp. 69-102 The book burnings were by and large organized by the DSt, albeit with support from the Reichsministerium. Likewise, Herrmann's blacklist, created on his own initiative, arose from his Nazi convictions. Not until later did Goebbels and his Ministry ‚Äì after a long power struggle with Alfred Rosenberg ‚Äì assume sole guidance of literature policy.Birgit Ebbert, \\"B√ºcherverbrennung 1933\\" Shoa.de Retrieved January 9, 2012  Blacklist and book burnings  The first \\"List of Books Worth Burning\\" appeared in the publication, Berliner Nachtausgabe on March 26, 1933. Preliminary and incomplete, it was soon replaced by a more thorough index. A month later, Herrmann began creating further lists of authors based on his blacklist, which he sent to the DSt for their \\"Action against the Un-German Spirit\\". Using these lists, student shock troops searched the libraries of universities and institutions and, beginning May 6, 1933, bookshops and lending libraries, removing the \\"harmful and undesirable literature\\". Public libraries were then pressured to \\"clean up\\" their own stocks; the books culled were to be handed over to the DSt for public book burnings on May 10, 1933. Herrmann's blacklist was republished on May 16, 1933, in B√∂rsenblatt, a weekly trade publication for German bookstores, as Prussia's first official list of banned books. Persecuted authors Photogravure of Victor Hugo, 1883. Franz Kafka in 1910 H. G. Wells in 1943 Among the German-speaking authors whose books student leaders burned that night were Walter Benjamin, Ernst Bloch, Bertolt Brecht, Max Brod, Otto Dix, Alfred D√∂blin, Albert Einstein, Friedrich Engels, Lion Feuchtwanger, Marieluise Flei√üer, Leonhard Frank, Sigmund Freud, Iwan Goll, George Grosz, Jaroslav Ha≈°ek, Heinrich Heine, √ñd√∂n von Horvath, Heinrich Eduard Jacob, Franz Kafka, Georg Kaiser, Erich K√§stner, Alfred Kerr, Egon Kisch, Siegfried Kracauer, Karl Kraus, Theodor Lessing, Alexander Lernet- Holenia, Karl Liebknecht, Georg Luk√°cs, Rosa Luxemburg, Heinrich Mann, Klaus Mann, Ludwig Marcuse, Karl Marx, Robert Musil, Carl von Ossietzky, Erwin Piscator, Alfred Polgar, Erich Maria Remarque, Ludwig Renn, Joachim Ringelnatz, Joseph Roth, Nelly Sachs, Felix Salten, Anna Seghers, Arthur Schnitzler, Carl Sternheim, Bertha von Suttner, Ernst Toller, Kurt Tucholsky, Jakob Wassermann, Frank Wedekind, Franz Werfel, Grete Weiskopf, Arnold Zweig and Stefan Zweig. Not only German-speaking authors were burned but also French authors like Victor Hugo, Andr√© Gide, Romain Rolland, Henri Barbusse, American writers such as Ernest Hemingway, Upton Sinclair, Theodore Dreiser, Jack London, John Dos Passos, and Helen Keller as well as English authors Joseph Conrad, D.H. Lawrence, H.G. Wells and Aldous Huxley, Irish writer James Joyce and Russian authors including Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Maxim Gorki, Isaac Babel, Vladimir Lenin, Vladimir Nabokov, Leo Tolstoy, Leon Trotsky, Vladimir Mayakovsky, and Ilya Ehrenburg. The burning of the books represents a culmination of the persecution of those authors whose verbal or written opinions were opposed to Nazi ideology. Many artists, writers and scientists were banned from working and publication. Their works could no longer be found in libraries or in the curricula of schools or universities. Some of them were driven to exile (like Walter Mehring and Arnold Zweig); others were deprived of their citizenship (for example Ernst Toller and Kurt Tucholsky) or forced into a self-imposed exile from society (e.g. Erich K√§stner). For other writers the Nazi persecutions ended in death. Some of them died in concentration camps, due to the consequences of the conditions of imprisonment, or were executed (like Carl von Ossietzky, Erich M√ºhsam, Gertrud Kolmar, Jakob van Hoddis, Paul Kornfeld, Arno Nadel and Georg Hermann, Theodor Wolff, Adam Kuckhoff, Rudolf Hilferding). Exiled authors despaired and committed suicide, for example: Walter Hasenclever, Ernst Weiss, Carl Einstein, Walter Benjamin, Ernst Toller, and Stefan Zweig.

She attended Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. She married her husband, Robert Shady, on August 24, 2019. Survivor South Pacific Clarke was one of 18 contestants on Survivor: South Pacific, the 23rd season of Survivor. On the first night, she formed a final five alliance that would dominate the game with fellow contestants Benjamin \\"Coach\\" Wade, Rick Nelson, Brandon Hantz, and Albert Destrade. Wade then recruited Edna Ma as the sixth member of their alliance. After the merge, the six player alliance eliminated all of the other players from the game. Clarke won her first immunity challenge on Day 27 of the game. After that night's tribal council vote, another immunity challenge immediately took place, which she also won. At the game's final immunity challenge, Ozzy Lusth had a significant lead in the beginning, but after he got stuck on the puzzle, Clarke came from behind to win, and Lusth was subsequently voted out and became the last jury member. With Clarke, Wade, and Destrade as the Final Three, she began to reflect on the game and how it changed her. She felt she outplayed, outlasted and outwitted everyone by winning the most immunity challenges and by keeping her first day alliance intact. In the end, the jury rewarded her in a 6‚Äì3‚Äì0 vote over Wade and Destrade. She received votes from Hantz, Lusth, Whitney Duncan, Dawn Meehan, Jim Rice, and Keith Tollefson.

During the Zagreb Spring Salon of the 1920s, he participated with Vilko Gecan, Marijan Trep≈°e and Vladimir Varlaj as the Group of Four. Uzelac spent much of his professional life in France, and is best known for his portraits and interior scenes with bohemian characters. Biography Milivoj Uzelac was born 23 July 1897 in Mostar to a Serbian family, which was then part of Austria-Hungary. In 1903, the family moved to Banja Luka. At the gymnasium there, he started drawing and painting under Pero Popoviƒá, a former student of Vlaho Bukovac. There he met fellow artist Vilko Gecan, with whom he developed a lasting friendship. Uzelac's father died in the autumn of 1911, and the following year his mother took Milivoj and his two sisters to Zagreb. In 1912-13, Uzelac, together with Vilko Gecan, attended the private art school of Tomislav Krizman. In November that year, they first encountered the work of Miroslav Kraljeviƒá, who was to become a significant influence on the art of their generation. At the age of 16, Uzelac passed the entrance exam for the College for Arts and Crafts, and spent two years studying under Oton Ivekoviƒá In 1915, during the First World War, Uzelac moved to Prague where he worked in the studio of the painter Jan Preisler, while attending classes at the Academy. He was later joined by Vilko Gecan, Marijan Trep≈°e and Vladimir Varlaj. Following the end of the war, in 1919 the four returned to Zagreb, where they exhibited their work at the Spring Salon. In the autumn of 1920, the Artists‚Äô Association allotted Uzelac a studio in Zagreb, where he produced some of his strongest work. In 1921, he spent the early part of the year in Paris, in the Montparnasse area. In 1923, Uzelac moved to Paris, taking up his residence in the suburb of Malakoff. He painted extensively, and absorbed the current ideas of classicism and cubism. He fitted well into his new surroundings, receiving commissions and successfully selling his work. Only one year after his arrival, he entered four paintings into the autumn salon. By 1925, Uzelac's success led to his first solo exhibition in Paris at the Marguerite library. He was working hard during the day, and living a full social life at night. Success brought prosperity, and he socialized with many influential people and collectors, as well as with beautiful women. In 1928, he moved from the suburbs into a studio in town, where Vilko Gecan visited him that summer. In 1930, Uzelac met Rosemarie da la Rayere, who was to become his permanent model and partner in life. From 1935 Uzelac increasingly spent time in the south of France, and in 1963, the family moved to Cotignac. In 1971, the Modern Gallery in Zagreb held a retrospective exhibition of his work. In 2008-9, the Art Pavilion held a posthumous retrospective. Milivoj Uzelac died on 6 June 1977 in Cotignac, France.  Legacy  Uzelac and his fellow painters made Prague an important reference for Croatian modern art. There they picked up new ideas of jugendstil (art nouveau), symbolism, secessionism and expressionism from Germany, as well as Manet and C√©zanne, along with cubist ideas from Paris, Miroslav Kraljevic from Zagreb, old masters such as Vel√°zquez, Van Dyck, Goya. During the Prague- Zagreb years (up to 1923), Uzelac's work reflected the spirit of war-torn Austro-Hungary, with a strong social content and move to return to nature. Between 1918 and 1923, his work includes narrative, expressive scenes with a nightmarish and sometimes erotic quality. Images depict a bohemian revelry with a cast of interesting characters - artists, writers, singers, actors, dancers, circus performers - especially girls and young women. Some of Uzelac's best work of the time was produced at his studio in Zagreb, including \\"In the Studio of the Bohemian\\" (1920). This painting shows strong influences of Miroslav Kraljeviƒá and √âdouard Manet, and demonstrates a new maturity in Uzelac's work. His brief stay in Paris in early 1921 added Neo-Cubism ideas from the school of Andr√© Lhote. In the paintings following his return to Zagreb, a new spatial organization appeared, and active reduction in the forms. In 1923, Uzelac produced the painting that is now considered to be his key work: \\"Self-Portrait in front of a Bar\\". After his permanent move to France (1923-1977), Uzelac produced an extensive number of works in a wide range of techniques: oil, tempera, lacquer, gouache, chalk, ink, and graphics. He created many decorative panels for private homes and public spaces, stage sets, posters, illustrations and ceramics. Uzelac's work can be considered more eclectic than avantgarde. He painted portraits, views, street scenes, caf√©s and scenes from private life, with an ease that could appear superficial. Uzelac was a master at shaping the body, particularly of female subjects. His portraits create a feeling of intimacy, a strong feature of his painting style. Travels to the south of France produced a series of lighter paintings in a brighter colour palette. Amongst his vast output were a string of great works in which references to Matisse and Derain were executed in Uzelac's own personal style. These include Portrait of a Woman with a Model Sailing Ship (1931), Area from the Window (1932), Plane Trees (1933), Black Skin (1934), Odalisque on Cushions (1934), and Painter and Model (1934). Though much of his life was spent in France, Uzelac continued to maintain links with the Croatian art scene, exhibiting in Zagreb and other places within the former Yugoslavia right up to the end of his life. In 2002, the Croatian Post issued a stamp with Uzelac's \\"Girl in a Boat\\", as part of their Croatian Modern Arts series.

The location, near the Cane River, later became well known as the site location for the film Steel Magnolias. Lenny LaCour's career in music initially commenced as a performer and songwriter, based in Chicago. LaCour's Creole heritage enabled him to move freely between Chicago's black and white nightclubs during the early 50s. \\"There were only two people doing that,\\" LaCour has said. The other was Leonard Chess, owner of Chess Records. In 1952, he auditioned for Leonard Chess, who rejected him, stating in the presence of Muddy Waters and LaCour that Chess Records did not produce white artists. Waters is reported to have said, \\"Mr. Chess, he's got a whole lot of soul in his voice.\\" From 1952 to 1956, LaCour released several singles on the Chicago-based All American, Spin and Meteor labels.

LaCour trademarked the name \\"King Creole\\" in 1952, and has asserted that a chance meeting with Elvis Presley was the inspiration for the title of the Presley movie King Creole. In 1958, LaCour established his own publishing company and, in 1959, he started his first record label, Lucky Four Records, where LaCour was the songwriter, arranger, producer and main artist. He recorded under the name \\"Big Rocker\\". He also produced other groups, most notably the doo-wop groups the Swinging Hearts and The Uniques.

In Milwaukee, LaCour had more success recording local acts than in Chicago, particularly in relation to Harvey Scales, who co-wrote and released \\"Love-Itis\\" and was the later co- writer of \\"Disco Lady\\". In 1969, LaCour produced the band, Filet of Soul (previously known as Attila and The Huns), which was a white band that mixed soul and psychedelic music. In the late 1970s, LaCour returned to Chicago, and resurrected the Magic Touch label. He thereafter released a number of unsuccessful disco records on Magic Touch. LaCour continues to operate the label. The success of LaCour and his artists was hampered by the fact that LaCour was unable to obtain a national distribution contract for his records. He expected that, if the song were popular locally, national distributors would come to him. Such national distribution generally did not occur.BadCat Records, . Cashbox Magazine, 2006.

They were supported by the pharaohs of Egypt, Nectanebo I, Teos, and Nectanebo II, to whom was sent Rheomithres who came back with 50 ships and 500 talents, and all joined forces against Artaxerxes II. Revolt of Datames (372-362 BC) Satrap Datames started to revolt in 372 BC. Datames, the satrap of Cappadocia and a talented military commander, had inherited his satrapy from his father Camissares after 384 BC but later problems with the court led him to revolt in 372 BC. The court commanded the neighboring satraps, Autophradates of Lydia and Artumpara of Lycia, to crush the rebellion but Datames successfully resisted their attacks.Brosius 2006, p. 28 Datames was killed in 362 BC after his son in law Mitrobarzanes betrayed him, falsely claiming to be his ally against the Achaemenid king.Brosius 2006, p. 28 Revolt of Ariobarzanes (366-363 BC) Ariobarzanes, satrap of Phrygia and a son of the ruler of Pontus, had been made acting satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia until Artabazos, the legitimate heir of the satrapy could take office. But when Artabazos was ready to take the satrapy Ariobarzanes refused to surrender it and joined Datames' revolt in 366 BC.Brosius 2006, p. 28 Ariobarzanes sought foreign aid and he received it from King Agesilaus II of Sparta.Brosius 2006, p. 29 Ariobarzanes withstood a siege at Adramyttium in 366 BC, from Mausolus of Caria and Autophradates of Lydia, until Agesilaus negotiated the besiegers' retreat.Gershevitch 1985, p. 378 As signal of sympathy in the effort, Athens made Ariobarzanes and three of his sons citizens of Athens.

In 362 Orontes, satrap of Armenia, revolted after he was ordered by the King to move to Mysia. His noble birth led the other satraps to recognize him as leader of the revolt, but Orontes later sought a compromise with the King and betrayed the other satraps, and the rebellion collapsed shortly afterward.Nelson 1984, p. 131 Orontes received much of the Aegean coastNelson 1984, p. 131 while Datames was killed after his son in law Mitrobarzanes betrayed him.Brosius 2006, p. 28 Ariobarzanes was also killed, but the other satraps were pardoned, thus ending the rebellion.Nelson 1984, p. 131 References  Sources   p386 * p94 * 360s BC conflicts Rebellions against the Achaemenid Empire Ancient Anatolia 370s BC 360s BC Artaxerxes II of Persia ","title":"Great Satraps' Revolt"},{"id":"34118033","text":"The Land O'Corn was a streamlined passenger train operated by the Illinois Central Railroad between Chicago, Illinois, and Waterloo, Iowa, from 1941 until 1967. Its inception was due in no small part to John W. Rath of Ackley, IA and part owner of the Rath Packing Co. of Waterloo, Iowa as well as a member of the Illinois Central's board of directors. It featured a wide range of equipment over its existence, including self-propelled Motorailers and steam locomotives, before finally adopting conventional diesel locomotives and lightweight cars. The Illinois Central discontinued the Land O'Corn in 1967; Amtrak later operated the Black Hawk over part of its route.  History  Initially the Illinois Central used self-propelled \\"Motorailers\\" manufactured by the American Car and Foundry Company. The Motorailer was a two-unit diesel multiple unit with a top speed of . Both units were powered; the driving car had two engines and the trailer one. Each engine was rated at . The lead car seated 70 while the rear car seated 39 for a total capacity of 109. The rear car included a coffee shop/cafe with limited seating. Unusually, the engineer sat in the open at the front of the driving car. Each car was long. The Motorailer-equipped Land O'Corn made its first run between Chicago and Waterloo on October 26, 1941. In February 1942 a collision with a beer truck wrecked the Motorailer and killed the engineer. Material shortages caused by World War II prevented ACF from building a replacement so the Illinois Central began operating regular steam-pulled coaches over the schedule. The Illinois Central re-equipped the Land O'Corn with diesel-pulled lightweight equipment on February 12, 1947, although steam engines continued to substitute well into the 1950s. The train's new consist was four 56-seat lightweight coaches built by Pullman-Standard (part of a larger order which reequipped the City of New Orleans and Green Diamond) and a heavyweight cafe/lounge. An EMD E7 headed up the train. The Land O'Corn made the Waterloo-Chicago run in 5.5 hours (lengthening to 6-6.5 hours by the mid-1960s), departing Waterloo in the morning and returning in the evening. A standard consist in the diesel era was three coaches and a cafe. The Land O'Corn continued operating into the 1960s as the counterpart to the overnight Hawkeye, which continued west to Sioux City, Iowa. The Illinois Central discontinued the Land O'Corn on August 5, 1967. Amtrak revived service over part of the Land O'Corn's route 1974-1981 when it operated a train between Chicago and Dubuque, Iowa. Amtrak proposed naming this train the Land O'Corn, but Illinois (which funded the service) preferred a more Illinois-centric name, so Amtrak named it the Black Hawk.

The Snoose Boulevard Festival The Snoose Boulevard Festival was held in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis from 1972 through 1977. In the late 19th century Cedar Avenue became known as ‚ÄúSnoose Boulevard‚Äù, a nickname often given to the main street in Scandinavian communities. The term derived from the residents‚Äô fondness for snus (snuff), an inexpensive form of tobacco. The event, which celebrated the area‚Äôs Scandinavian past, featured the music, food, and arts of the immigrants who had once lived there. It also highlighted the careers of Olle i Skratthult (Hjalmar Peterson), Slim Jim and the Vagabond Kid (Ernest and Clarence Iverson) and the Olson Sisters (Eleonora and Ethel Olson).Seward Profile April 2005. The headline performer was the Swedish-born singer Anne- Charlotte Harvey. In conjunction with the festival she recorded three albums of folk tunes, emigrant ballads, hymns, waltzes and comic songs.

With a peak elevation of ,summitpost.org it is the highest peak in the San Bernardino Mountains outside the San Gorgonio Wilderness.\\"Sugarloaf Mountain ‚Äì A Sweet Way to Go\\", Los Angeles Times, October 17, 1987. Wilderness permits are not required to hike the peak, but a Forest Service pass is required to park on any fire road. Sugarloaf Mountain is clearly visible in most parts of Big Bear Valley. The peak is especially prominent when entering the Big Bear area from Highway 18 from the Lucerne Valley. Located in a unique transition zone in Southern California, the climate is influenced by the deserts, the inland valley, and alpine climates. The north face of the summit is usually covered with snow during the winter months.  Flora and fauna  The flora and fauna of Sugarloaf Mountain are representative of a transitional zone between inland desert, mountain, and inland valley climates. The mountain and surrounding forests are home to many rare and endemic plant species. Looming over the southern part of the Big Bear Valley and the village of Sugarloaf, the northern slopes of the mountain are heavily forested with second-growth Jeffrey Pine and White Firs. At higher altitudes on the north-facing slope, Limber and Lodgepole Pines near the summit are twisted into Krummholz formations. The forest on the east facing slope is drier, and the vegetation shows the influence of the Mojave Desert; sagebrush and junipers are more dominant. The southern slope of the mountain is covered in scrubby manzanita bushes and extensive rock scree, with a few hardy Jeffery pines. Snow rarely stays more than few days once the sun shines on the southern face, while the much cooler northern face is covered with snow from early December to late May. A year-round spring on the north face forms a small creek that travels to the Greenspot Meadows, which is an excellent birding spot during the spring and summer. The northern slopes were formerly home to herds of wild burros that could be seen from Wildhorse Meadows Road. The Bureau of Land Management removed most of the burros from the Sugarloaf area, but some animals travel there from the lower deserts. Cougars and bears have been spotted in the forests to the west of the peak. In late spring, butterflies may be seen at the rock scree close to the summit.

Coblentz (born July 21, 1961) is a writer, educator, science policy adviser, international civil servant, and entrepreneur. He is an avid proponent of the use of advanced technology for sustainable development. Early life and schooling Home life Coblentz was raised in a pacifistic and insular Amish Mennonite community in Hartville, Ohio. Although the community as a whole was skeptical of higher education and advanced technology, Coblentz has described his father, Alvin S. Coblentz, as a \\"self- taught researcher, educator, and 'technologist' of sorts: a watch and clock repairman.\\" A biography of Alvin describes his design of a mechanical device that enabled the operation of an automobile accelerator and brake with a single pedal, compensating for his physical disability and allowing him to get a driver's license. Coblentz has also spoken of his father's creation, in the mid-1960s, of a functioning radio in a wrist-watch case, an invention that was never brought to market because of Alvin's lack of familiarity with the US patent process. The family of eight subsisted on the $200 per month Alvin earned from publishing a conservative Mennonite periodical, The Fellowship Messenger. Yet Coblentz says his stimulating home environment shaped him: > Well before I started school, I was reading, writing, and disassembling and > reassembling pocket watches on the kitchen table. The same incessant three > questions have driven me ever since, whether the challenge facing me was > setting a pocket watch mainspring, controlling the innards of a nuclear > submarine, streamlining a bureaucratic policy, unlocking the potential of a > research university, promoting a biotechnology business concept, or > unravelling the riddle of U.S.-Iran relations: \\"What makes it tick?\\" \\"How > can we make it work better?\\" and \\"How can we explain the answers to those > who need to know?\\" I became fascinated by the power of curiosity, the power > of innovation, and the power of narrative. Malone University Despite pressure from his church leaders to be content with a high-school education, Coblentz pushed to attend Malone University, a nearby Quaker college, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and Psychology in 1982. At Malone, Coblentz took up journalism and fiction, becoming the editor of the campus newspaper and the literary magazine. He also dabbled in theater ‚Äì a creative outlet that had been forbidden during his early years ‚Äì taking leading roles in four consecutive university productions, and writing and directing his first play, The Playground. United States Navy Shortly after leaving Malone, Coblentz took another ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù path, enlisting in the United States Navy, a decision that led to excommunication from his Amish Mennonite congregation. From 1983 to 1985 he studied reactor physics, nuclear propulsion engineering and radiochemistry at the Naval Nuclear Power School in Orlando and a small reactor prototype in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. This was his first exposure to advanced technology, a shift in focus that would impact his subsequent research and career. He then spent four years aboard the , a Sturgeon-class nuclear submarine. Coblentz has said that his first acquaintance with a nuclear weapon came via sleeping on one, referring to the makeshift bunks arranged atop the submarine's torpedo racking system where nuclear-capable Tomahawk missiles were stored.https://www.scribd.com/doc/52734982/US-Nuclear-Submarines-The-Fast- Attack Scholarship: tracing the nexus of scientific reasoning and literary symbolism While in the Navy, Coblentz began working on a Master of Arts degree in English from San Francisco State University. His research was heavily influenced by his conversations with the inventor and philosopher Arthur M. Young at the Institute for the Study of Consciousness in Berkeley; ideas on gender and ethnicity put forward by Kim F. Hall,http://barnard.edu/headlines/africana-studies-program-celebrates- its-20th-anniversary with whom Coblentz studied at Georgetown University; and studies of modernist and postmodernist literary criticism with Professor Geoffrey Green at SFSU. Coblentz's thesis drew on the novels of Thomas Pynchon, Vladimir Nabokov, and the lesser-known Carol DeChellis Hillhttp://biography.jrank.org/pages/4420/Hill-Carol.html to explore parallels between the thought systems underlying subatomic physics and the postmodernist use of symbol.Coblentz, Laban. Beyond Kute Korrespondences: Intersections in The Eleven Million Mile High Dancer. San Francisco: San Francisco State University Collections. 1995. ‚ÄúLike the apocalyptic prophets of the death of literature,‚Äù Coblentz wrote, ‚Äúsome physicists have operated in hopes of bringing their work to a closure, speaking of a near future when, with the origins of the material universe explained and the last frontier conquered, physics will become a closed discipline.‚Äù Science and symbolism in Renaissance England Coblentz's research systematically traces the interplay between scientific reasoning and literary movements ‚Äì particularly the use of symbol, myth, and language ‚Äì from the mid-16th century to the present. > For the Renaissance philosopher, the perfect language would be that in which > knowing the name of a thing equated to knowledge of the thing‚Äôs essential > nature. This idea, however, did not result in precise writing (in the way > that we think of preciseness), but in lavishly connotative language (as if > the writer were trying to light up the essence of the idea from all sides). > For the modern linear thinker, scientific prose of the time seems convoluted > and obscure. Alchemical recipe books, in their description of unfamiliar > processes, are nearly impossible to follow. > These frustrations to a modern reader ‚Ä¶ are partially because the > Objectivity Revolution has been so complete: that is, we have forgotten how > to think in the way that this language (i.e., this system of signification) > demands, and cannot readily tap the power it affords. The benefit of > connotative language, in a world of infinite correspondences, is the ability > to illuminate one discipline using the words (and concepts) of another ‚Ä¶. As > the richest literary achievements of the time demonstrate, a single action > or speech, by drawing on a universe of pre-established symbolic > relationships, can resonate with multiple meanings (i.e., participate in > several myths at once). The causative power attributed to language and symbol was what made its usage in Elizabethan England differ from contemporary practice, according to Coblentz: > While citizens polled in the 1990s may be uneasy about Bill Clinton‚Äôs > morals, few would articulate a belief that his extramarital activities would > directly impact on the nation‚Äôs security. Not so in Renaissance England: the > force and resonance of symbol demanded that Elizabeth I remain a Virgin > Queen, her publicized chastity a virtual guarantee that the island kingdom > would remain inviolate, her borders impenetrable to foreign armadas and > other unworthy suitors. Coblentz dissects the intersection of science, symbol, and public policy in this era, characterizing the ‚Äúscience of natural law‚Äù as a tool manipulated by the powerful: ‚ÄúThe established symbolic order of things ‚Ä¶ took on the weight of divine utterance. Careful manipulation of symbol along archetypal lines allowed individuals and countries to embody the archetypes they invoked. Symbol, properly configured, reinforced the power of the queen; slightly realigned, it fortified King James I.‚Äù Policy implications: gender, ethnicity, imperialism To illustrate this assertion, Coblentz examines the symbolism and pseudo-science applied to the archetypal ‚ÄúOther‚Äù ‚Äì particularly to blacks and women ‚Äì as England entered the 17th century: > In the English Renaissance cosmology of ‚Äúnatural correspondences‚Äù and ‚Äúself- > evident truth,‚Äù white skin was superior to black just as day follows night; > conveniently, the globe was constructed with Europe above and Africa below > (and hell, presumably, below that)‚Ä¶. On the scale of gender, the > disreputable qualities of changeability, insanity, and hysteria were virtues > female in nature. Female disorderliness ‚Ä¶ was first evidenced by Eve‚Äôs > illicit fit of munchies with the serpent in Eden ‚Ä¶. Reason (and more broadly > ‚Äì as Baconian science expanded the definition ‚Äì linear thinking, empirical > objectivity, emotional passivity) was a province naturally male, and > intuition (non-rational thought, ‚Äúsixth‚Äù senses, and emotional involvement) > more naturally feminine. This pseudo-science, taken a step further, provided an illegitimate but forceful ‚Äúmoral and political justification for a rapidly burgeoning imperialist consciousness‚Äù: > The self-evident superiority of white skin, a chaste queen, and English > manners and virtues made colonization a veritable service to the colonized. > All savages want to be civilized (read: Anglicized), just as all women want > to be penetrated and subdued by worthy men, just as all metals ‚Äúwould be > gold, if they had but time‚Äù [quoting Ben Jonson in The Alchemist ].‚Ä¶ [T]he > inherent superiority of the English white male could be extended (almost > sexually) to colonize (impregnate) the surrounding territory. Modern science and technology: an inherited imbalance Moving from the historical to the postmodern, Coblentz argues that similar irrational motivations continue to plague contemporary science, scientists, and science policy ‚Äì irrationality traceable, in part, to an ongoing battle between science and religion or faith. > If God is one with Nature, but above man‚Äôs comprehension, then Nature is a > mystery, and science will always be imperfect. If God has placed man over > Nature, and objective investigation holds the key, then Nature is > accessible, and science will eventually figure it out. It is as simple as > that. > My argument is not about religious faith. It is about reductionism versus a > web of paradoxical sense ‚Ä¶ [as] modes of approaching knowledge. It is one > way to explain the disproportionate Western ascendancy of yang over yin that > spawned the Industrial Revolution, that eventually found science > outstripping religion as the primary authority ... It is a way of > acknowledging the lopsided left-brain development that could devise > incredible new inventions with neither the intuitive foresight to anticipate > the implications nor the emotional skills to deal with the result. Here Coblentz quotes Murray Gell-Mann: ‚ÄúIt is difficult to imagine that a handful of residents of a small planet circling an insignificant star in a small galaxy have as their aim a complete understanding of the entire universe, a small speck of creation truly believing it is capable of comprehending the whole.‚Äù > Yet reductionism assumes precisely that. The mechanistic world-view assumes > a causality underlying all natural phenomena. It assumes, further, that both > the fundamental particles (to which all things reduce) and the absolute laws > governing their relationships to one another are discoverable by objective > investigation. Coblentz argues that the Einstein-Bohr divergence in view on quantum mechanics and the Copenhagen Interpretation was a difference rooted in epistemology, not strictly physics or mathematics, and thus ultimately led to a search for new forms of language and expression. > This epistemological struggle is also, for the individual scientist, a > psychological (even a Freudian) battleground ‚Äì a threat to the scientist‚Äôs > view of himself. The Einsteinian‚Äôs insistent refusal to accept Bohr‚Äôs > ambiguities is an insistence born of panic ‚Äì the panic of the dispassionate > objectivist (who is neither dispassionate nor objective except by his > inherited white male tradition) forced to face a Void (or, if you like, a > Womb) he cannot penetrate, forced to accept truth without explanation, a > ‚Äònon-material‚Äô ‚Äònon-thing‚Äô ‚Äònon-inhabiting‚Äô ‚Äònon-space‚Äô that nevertheless > demands acknowledgement (notice that language necessarily breaks down; there > are no words, and therefore no tools of discovery). > The distress that Relativism causes the classical physicist lies in its > ambiguity; it does not deny that truth exists, but it does deny that truth > can be comprehended (which, for the scientist, amounts to the same thing). > The scientist‚Äôs white lab-coat is soiled; he is part of the experiment. Just > as he was reaching shore (or so he thought), he is tossed back into the > primeval soup. These theories ‚Äì drawing on Coblentz's divergent early background in communication, psychology, and nuclear physics ‚Äì became the lens through which he came to view advanced science and technology. They would increasingly shape his career and particularly his public policy contributions in areas ranging from sustainable development and nuclear non-proliferation to higher education, technology transfer, and entrepreneurship. Career Nuclear Regulatory Commission Upon exiting the Navy, Coblentz worked briefly at the Waterford Nuclear Generating Station in southern Louisiana, then became a health physics and engineering safety inspector for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, primarily at West Coast nuclear facilities. =Public education on nuclear issues= The incisiveness of Coblentz's speaking and writing style prompted requests for him to develop a specialized communications course for nuclear inspectors, and eventually led to a nationwide overhaul of the nuclear inspection reporting system, which Coblentz headed. The resulting approach, as delineated in the NRC Inspection Manual Chapter 0610, has been incorporated into multiple national nuclear regulatory frameworks. Coblentz later reworked the fundamentals of this communications approach into courses on speechwriting and communication in an international context, which he tailored for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and other international organizations. It was during this time that he developed close professional ties to E. Gail de Planque, the NRC Commissioner and former head of the Department of Energy's Environmental Measurements Laboratory, with whom Coblentz shared a passion for improving the quality of public education on nuclear technology and transparency in nuclear activities. =Streamlining nuclear regulation= During Coblentz's tenure at the NRC, he was central to efforts to reform three additional problematic policy areas: the protection of nuclear whistleblowers, the consistency of NRC enforcement actions (violations, civil penalties, and shutdown orders), and the formal incorporation of risk analysis into regulatory oversight and, subsequently, into nuclear power plant operation and maintenance. =Risk- informed, performance-based regulation= The latter of these was the most significant for its long-term impact on the nuclear power industry. By this time, Coblentz's work had come to the attention of the new NRC Chairman, Shirley Ann Jackson, appointed by President Clinton in 1995, and he was working as Jackson's speechwriter and external relations adviser. A major challenge confronting the Commission was the counterproductive economic and safety impact of burdensome regulations that had accumulated over decades, coupled with continuing inconsistent safety performance at some nuclear facilities ‚Äì which inevitably led to additional regulations. Under Jackson's leadership, Coblentz and his colleagues developed a methodology for incorporating risk into regulation, inspection, and enforcement.https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/risk- informed/concept.html Jackson would come to call this ‚Äúrisk-informed, performance-based regulation.‚Äù For well over a decade, each nuclear power plant had been required to conduct a comprehensive probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) of their facility, but these assessments had largely remained on the shelf, as no method had been devised of incorporating them formally into nuclear regulation, operation, or maintenance.https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc- collections/commission/policy/60fr42622.pdf The ‚Äúrisk-informed, performance- based‚Äù approach, while still emphasizing safety performance as the bottom line, provided a system for prioritizing regulatory inspection and enforcement ‚Äì as well as rulemaking and licensing ‚Äì in accordance with the relative degree of risk of the associated nuclear systems, structures, components, and activities. The goal was two-fold: to provide a defensible basis for regulatory oversight, and to encourage nuclear power plant operators to focus their greatest attention and resources in areas of greatest safety significance. The change in approach required three elements: (1) an exhaustive analysis of the scenarios that could give rise to nuclear accidents (already accomplished for most plants via PRA); (2) the integration of risk analysis with public concerns, Congressional mandates, and other factors; (3) the designation of performance limits that, if adhered to, would acceptably protect against the identified risks. The transition in regulatory oversight was slow to take hold and went through multiple iterations. But the incorporation of PRA made sense ‚Äì not only to regulators but to their licensees, the nuclear operators ‚Äì who found it consistent with the best industrial management practices. The longstanding mantra of making safety the highest priority now had a qualitative and quantitative basis. Maintenance scheduling and budgets now had a framework to ensure measurable improvements in safety performance. A ‚Äúrisk-informed, performance-based‚Äù system made it possible to improve safety while simultaneously increasing economic competitiveness. =International nuclear programs= Coblentz and an NRC colleague, Janice Dunn Lee, also supported Jackson in the development of the International Nuclear Regulators Association (INRA). Coblentz later became Jackson's adviser on the NRC's international programs, offering bilateral assistance to developing countries in the formulation of legal and regulatory frameworks, the installation of nuclear medical facilities, and safety and security at nuclear power plants. Coblentz worked with the regulators and operators of post-Soviet states to upgrade inspection and enforcement programs and associated communication protocols. U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs =The e-Government Initiative= Shortly after Jackson completed her term as NRC Chairman, Coblentz was awarded a fellowship with the American Political Science Association. As part of the fellowship, he was selected by U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman to work on ‚ÄúThe e-Government Initiative‚Äù for the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, for which Lieberman was the ranking minority member. Coblentz designed and spearheaded the project with Kevin Landy, Lieberman's counsel on the Committee, negotiating with Senate rules officials to gain permission for this first-of- kind approach to use the Internet to engage citizens in online interaction, enabling direct public input in planning the electronic government legislation. For three months, members of the public were asked to comment on ways in which the federal government could deliver its services more efficiently and effectively via the Internet. Coblentz and Landy solicited many of the ideas directly from industry leaders; many others were suggested independently by individual citizens. The volume of public response was unprecedented. =The E-Government Act of 2002= Coblentz and Landy worked with Lieberman as well as with Senator Fred Thompson (the Committee Chairman) and his colleagues to distil the ideas into a coherent framework. Coblentz then prepared the initial draft legislation. By this time, Lieberman had been recruited by Vice President Al Gore as his running mate in the U.S. Presidential election, and the e-Government initiative was temporarily set aside; however, after the unsuccessful bid for the presidency, Lieberman introduced the legislation. The result was the E-Government Act of 2002, a transformative mandate for using information technology to improve the accessibility and cost-effectiveness of U.S. government services. International Atomic Energy Agency In August 2000, at the recommendation of his friend and mentor, E. Gail de Planque, Coblentz moved to Vienna to become an international civil servant at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). At the IAEA, he was the speechwriter and communication adviser to Director General Mohamed ElBaradei. He contributed to pivotal policy decisions, such as: ElBaradei's push to revive the international nuclear fuel bank (envisioned in Eisenhower's original ‚ÄúAtoms for Peace‚Äù initiative), as first articulated in an article in The Economist in late 2003; ElBaradei's support for the 2006 U.S.-India deal to revive exchange of nuclear technology, which was heavily criticized by the traditional safeguards establishment but strongly pushed by the Bush administration; and a series of high-stakes nuclear nonproliferation crises in Iraq, Iran, Libya, and North Korea. =The Age of Deception= Coblentz has frequently drawn attention to the degree to which non-technological factors, ranging from cultural nuance to geopolitics, have contributed to these crises. He collaborated with ElBaradei on The Age of Deception: Nuclear Diplomacy in Treacherous Times, a behind-the-scenes account of these nuclear crises, published by Henry Holt in 2011. The most eye-opening revelations in The Age of Deception, according to Coblentz, highlight ‚Äúthe degree to which political considerations by various governments trumped real avenues for diplomatic solutions.‚Äù Coblentz has described touring a munitions factory near Baghdad in the lead-up to the Iraq War, during which he observed Iraqi engineers forging 80-millimeter rocket shells. ‚ÄúThe operator was using gloves and tongs to handle red-hot metal, but had no safety goggles; he was wearing sandals instead of safety shoes. Throughout the plant, the most sophisticated pieces of equipment, with labels from Siemens and other hi-tech manufacturers, were layered with dust.‚Äù The operators admitted that most of the equipment had not worked in years. There was no equipment maintenance program, nor were there spare parts. These engineering deficiencies were characteristic across Iraq. ‚ÄúThe inference was clear: it was highly unlikely that Iraq had retained the necessary degree of engineering sophistication to build centrifuge cascades for uranium enrichment.‚Äù =Iraq as a turning point for the IAEA= According to Coblentz, the nuclear inspections in Iraq represented a turning point for ElBaradei and the IAEA. On the day that the IAEA was asked by the U.S. to pull its inspectors out of Iraq, in advance of the March 2003 bombing, ElBaradei altered the draft of a speech he was about to deliver to the IAEA Board of Governors, adding a quote from Adlai Stevenson: ‚ÄúThere is no evil in the atom; only in men‚Äôs souls.‚Äù > I think what that represented for him ‚Äì having been in Baghdad myself ‚Ä¶ > finding many of the allegations, the points on which the U.S. and the U.K. > were making their case to be inaccurate, it seemed very clear to [ElBaradei] > that he was building the case for why there was ‚Ä¶ no imminent threat. And to > have that overridden ‚Ä¶ was a real turning point. His backbone had always > been very stiff; but I think this was the occasion on which he basically > said, ‚ÄúNever again on my watch.‚Äù =The 2005 Nobel Peace Prize= In 2005, the IAEA and its Director-General were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Coblentz has described working with ElBaradei on the Nobel speech: > Everything that you have seen and worked for over the past 30 years ‚Äì how do > you compress that into 20 minutes? What is really the message you want to > send [to a global audience]? And we came back to the Iraq War because he had > begun to think that the two twin themes of the UN, security and development, > really were a single theme. ‚Ä¶ We were sitting in his office and [ElBaradei] > said ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWhat the Iraq War should have taught us is that security and > development are inextricably intertwined.‚Äù Where you have poverty and > abrogation of human rights, you also often have inept governance, you have a > circumstance in which people, as they see the inequity, and are not allowed > to express their views, the result is a natural situation for fomenting not > only humiliation and injustice but anger, and a sense of wanting to redress > wrongs. So from that you have violence of multiple sorts: you have civil > strife; you have a breeding ground for extremism; and ultimately, if the > seeds are sown deeply enough, that is where we are seeing the pursuit of > weapons of mass destruction. =Importance of values in a technology context= In the wake of the Nobel award, ElBaradei was asked to speak on a much broader range of non- technological themes such as religion, faith, and tolerance. Coblentz has recounted how, on the eve of a trip to New York in which ElBaradei was to receive the Human Security Award from the Muslim Public Affairs Council and the James Parks Morton Interfaith Award, ElBaradei had asked Coblentz to focus the remarks on values common to all religions. > We had identified passages from the Quran, the Talmud, the New Testament, > the Bhagavad-Gita, etcetera, dealing with universal values such as > integrity, charity, and faith. And that day we received news of the shooting > of Amish schoolchildren in West Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania. Mohamed called > me in to express his horror and his sympathy. He asked me how I thought the > Amish would respond. The difference we would witness, I told him, was that > the Amish would immediately forgive the shooter and demonstrate that > forgiveness to the shooter‚Äôs family. In that moment, we both realized the > importance of highlighting another universal value: forgiveness. I felt as > if my Amish Mennonite background was reaching out to me again, this time in > the nuclear context of the IAEA. Speaking about the ongoing tension over Iran's nuclear program, Coblentz has noted the ways in which miscommunication, disrespect, and a lack of cultural understanding have compounded the standoff between Iran and the West. As an IAEA spokesperson, he repeated ElBaradei's mantra that Iran needed to address a ‚Äúconfidence deficit‚Äù with the international community. ‚ÄúWhat we would hope for is that Iran and other parties would be able to engage in a dialogue that would restore trust.‚Äù Coblentz has continued to emphasize the complexity of the dilemma facing ElBaradei and his successor, Yukiya Amano, when dealing with unverified allegations about Iran's nuclear program. Coblentz has appeared as an IAEA nuclear safety expert in The Nuclear Option, a documentary film focused on the capacity of nuclear power as a source of sustainable, non- greenhouse gas emitting energy. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute While at the IAEA, Coblentz had continued to collaborate with his former boss, Shirley Ann Jackson, on science policy concepts and speeches. During Jackson's tenure as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, for example, she had worked with Coblentz on the theme of the ‚ÄúNexus of Science and Society,‚Äù tracing the historical development of science policy and the role of scientists as authoritative sources in society. In late 2007, Coblentz left the IAEA to work with Jackson again as Chief of Staff and Associate Vice President of Policy and Planning at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), a research university in upstate New York where Jackson was the university president. =EMPAC= Under Jackson, Coblentz led the launch of RPI's $220 million Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC). Coblentz developed a close professional relationship with Johannes Goebel, the Director of EMPAC, whose unique expertise and body of work at the nexus of science, technology, and the arts was embodied in the EMPAC academic mission as well as in its physical design. With its extraordinary acoustics and capabilities for creating immersive human-scale multisensory environments, EMPAC lays claim to being three buildings in one: a performance venue for time-based arts, an educational facility, and a first-of-kind research laboratory. =Sustainability at RPI= Shortly after Coblentz's arrival at RPI, Jackson asked him to be the primary touch-point for sustainability initiatives on campus. He served as lead advisor for the Student Sustainability Task Force (SSTF), managing the creation of the RPI Sustainability Charrette and creating a coalition of students, faculty, staff, and administrators that launched dozens of green projects at RPI. Within two years, RPI was featured by the Princeton Review as being among the nation's most environmentally responsible universities. =Technology Commercialization and Entrepreneurship= Jackson also asked Coblentz to oversee a trio of RPI operations focused on intellectual property protection and technology transfer: the Rensselaer Incubator, the Office of Technology Commercialization, and the 1250-acre Rensselaer Technology Park. Coblentz created the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Council to bring coherence to university wide tech transfer operations, and revamped the RPI incubation approach, launching the Emerging Ventures Ecosystem (EVE) in February 2011. The EVE concept used a ‚Äúdistributed incubation‚Äù approach, placing RPI student and faculty start-up businesses in downtown Troy, integrating RPI's academic prowess in engineering and entrepreneurship with a local focus on urban renewal and drawing on the global RPI network of successful alumni entrepreneurs. ‚ÄúOur goal is to facilitate and ‚Äòturbo-charge,‚Äô if you like, every aspect of technology transfer, from idea generation to patenting and licensing to global growth,‚Äù Coblentz said. ‚ÄúTo do that, we intend to tap the entire range of Rensselaer resources, and to create partnerships that take symbiotic advantage of strengths in the local community, for mutual benefit.‚Äù =Departure From RPI= Coblentz left RPI in September 2011 without public explanation, leading to speculation on the reasons for his departure. The Albany Times Union suggested that he had been ‚Äúforced out for questioning Jackson‚Äôs leadership.‚Äù Entrepreneurship: technology to address global challenges On leaving RPI, Coblentz began working on a number of start-up ventures. Make It Private, LLC, based in Plano, Texas, builds on advances in the control of digital information, using tokenization to protect consumer privacy (including the prescriptive requirements of the EU Data Directive), and to enable data security in the cloud. In 2012, Coblentz founded the Tech Valley Center of Gravity (CoG), an award-winning New York not-for-profit focused explicitly on the retention and growth of post-university professionals in New York's Capital District. With the support of a local group of inventors and entrepreneurs, Coblentz transformed an abandoned 5000 square-foot off-track betting facility into a MakerSpace, a member-governed \\"idea factory\\" outfitted for metalworking, woodworking, 3D printing, optics, biotech, robotics, electronics, welding, and textile work. The CoG welcomed artists, engineers, scientists, and \\"creators\\" from any discipline. It has experienced rapid growth in its first two years, acquiring more than 200 members and serving nearly 50 companies, and experiencing substantial support from municipal and State government agencies, private sector donors, academic institutions, and local NGOs. In June 2013, Coblentz and the Center of Gravity were recognized by New York's Center for Economic Growth (CEG) with their 2013 Technology Innovation Award. Coblentz spoke to the CEG about his motivation for creating the COG: > I didn't want to do another incubator. However, I did have a fixation on > serving post-university professionals - and especially technology > entrepreneurs, the segment of the economic ecosystem that is most creative, > most open to advice and most willing to take risks. The Center of Gravity > provides a resource for those young people - and for creators of all ages, > anyone with an idea - who do not have access to university equipment or > their own manufacturing > plant.https://www.informz.net/ceg/data/images/tusupplement_opt.pdf In a discussion with the Albany Business Review, Coblentz explained the design of the Center of Gravity's hybrid incubator-makerspace model as an economic development measure intended to counteract the ‚Äúexodus‚Äù of young innovators from the regional economy. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre great at attracting them to our universities. We get them addicted to state-of-the-art equipment and laboratories and intellectual discourse. Then we watch them leave the region. It's economic lunacy.‚Äù Coblentz explicitly differentiated the Center of Gravity from a traditional business incubator, referring to the CoG model as \\"community-based business cultivation.\\" According to Coblentz: \\"We don't 'incubate' or isolate. We integrate. We want our companies to be tied into Troy's hands-on urban scene, adding vibrancy and can-do creativity as part of the community.\\" CoG members have full access to MakerSpace equipment and expertise. Instead of focusing exclusively on entrepreneurs and commercialization activity, as most incubators would do, hobbyists and \\"weekend warriors\\" are also considered a core part of the CoG community. Social activities are part of the CoG's core programming. CoG members also have access to \\"SPECTRVM\\": shared business services ranging from sales and marketing to grant writing and CFOs-for-hire, at scaled rates that match a company's budget and stage of growth. In 2014, based in part on a $550,000 grant from the Empire State Development Corporation, Coblentz and the Center of Gravity launched a $4 million renovation of the Quackenbush, a long-vacant Victorian-era building in the heart of downtown Troy. In January 2015, the Quackenbush was approved for Start-Up New York designation with Hudson Valley Community College. On August 19, 2015, New York Governor Cuomo announced the opening of the new facility, characterizing the Center of Gravity as playing ‚Äúa vital role in helping the Capital Region‚Äôs tech industry flourish.‚Äù In less than four years, the Center of Gravity had grown to support a broad range of companies, most focused on high-tech innovation, such as ‚Äúa 3D printer manufacturer, a team of RPI grads making bacteria-killing light fixtures, and a company designing aquaponics systems for the Caribbean island of Dominica.‚Äù The Quackenbush would provide a new home for many of those companies. Involvement in Egyptian Revolution Coblentz continued to work closely with his former boss, Mohamed ElBaradei, during his time at RPI. In addition to collaboration on The Age of Deception, Coblentz assisted ElBaradei on op- eds and articles criticizing the Mubarak regime in Egypt. During the early days of the Egyptian Revolution, Coblentz and other IAEA colleagues of ElBaradei contradicted the notion that ElBaradei had only recently become engaged in Egyptian politics, saying he had never relinquished his focus on human rights deficiencies in his home country. Coblentz noted that ElBaradei had first confronted Mubarak in early 2003, during the lead-up to the Iraq War, as well as on subsequent encounters. Coblentz has pointed out the role that social media played in convincing ElBaradei that the young people of Egypt were ready for change: ‚ÄúIt was really this last 14 months, where someone I knew as not being particularly computer savvy, taught himself to use Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and started to do in virtual space what was forbidden to do by the Mubarak regime, the freedom of assembly by large groups.‚Äù Coblentz says that, as part of this interaction with the youth of Egypt, ElBaradei realized he had something unique to offer: > There was a Facebook page that had been put out there by really a 20s-30s > crowd in Egypt ‚Äì ‚ÄúElBaradei for President‚Äù ‚Äì or something of that title‚Ä¶. > And he realized that ‚Ä¶ he had something unique to offer, that he had this > international credibility, that he had been accustomed to very high tension > situations, that he had had this experience of standing in the gap with > pressure from the US or the UK on the one hand, or from Iran or North Korea > on the other hand, and managed to chart [an independent route]. This was > something the young people found very appealing.‚Äù ITER: harnessing fusion energy  In September 2015, shortly after the opening of the new Center of Gravity facility, Coblentz took a new position as head of communication at ITER, the full-scale nuclear fusion facility in Saint-Paul-lez-Durance, France. The largest, most complex multinational science and technology project in history, ITER is designed to demonstrate a self-heating or ‚Äúburning‚Äù plasma, paving the way for the first commercial electricity plants powered by fusion. Fusion, the mass-to-energy conversion created by the high-speed collision of atomic nuclei, is the engine that powers the sun and stars. As Coblentz said to CNN, ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre really doing here [at ITER] is trying to build a star on Earth.‚Äù The technological approach, known as magnetic confinement fusion, has been demonstrated in hundreds of experimental machines over the past six decades, usually in the form of a tokamak or a stellarator. By constructing and demonstrating a full- scale facility, the ITER Tokamak will, as Coblentz puts it, ‚Äúmake the C.A.S.E. for fusion‚Äù as a Clean (carbon-free, minimal waste), Abundant (millions of years of fuel), Safe (inherently safe physics, no possibility of meltdown), and Economic (competitive cost per kilowatt-hour; elimination of the costs of conflict and competition that go with a petroleum-based energy economy) source of energy. The ITER machine is extraordinarily complex, designed to comprise more than 1 million components. This complexity is compounded further by the intricate funding and in-kind contribution of those components by the seven ITER Members ‚Äì China, India, Japan, Korea, Russia, the United States, and the European Union ‚Äì under the 2006 ITER Agreement. The benefit of this arrangement is that the major powers pool their best expertise, share the costs, and receive equal access to the intellectual property and technology spin-offs, much like CERN. The challenge, on the other hand, is managing such an arrangement. It is perhaps not surprising that the ITER project had encountered management shortcomings, cost overruns and delays. A sharply critical 2013 audit, leaked to Raffi Katchadourian at The New Yorker, called for urgent reform. Coblentz was hired by the new ITER Director-General, Bernard Bigot, as part of a senior management team brought in to get the project back on track. Comprehensive reform included integration of the ITER Organization with its Domestic Agencies, more effective decision-making and communication, exhaustive reassessment of the construction and assembly schedule and associated costs, finalization of major component design, and creation of a project culture applying the best principles of risk management and systems engineering. By mid-2016, project critics were becoming cautiously optimistic, noting the rejuvenated pace of ITER construction onsite and component manufacturing worldwide. Additional countries were expressing interest in joining the newly revitalized project, including, notably, Iran ‚Äì which, as Coblentz noted to the Associated Press, highlights the exclusively peaceful nature of ITER and magnetic confinement fusion. By the end of 2016, ITER reported that all of the 19 major project milestones for 2016 had been met, on schedule and on budget.  Personal  Coblentz currently resides in Aix-en-Provence, France with his wife and daughter. He has continued to write plays, including Charades and The Oedipus Experiment. Coblentz also has been fictionalized as a resourceful and ornery naval engineer in the historical serial, Letterstime, Ein Geleitzug: an Alternate History of World War I.

Only three chapters were published. Un gentilhomme, Flammarion, 1920  An unachievable novel  It was in the mid-1890s that Octave Mirbeau first began contemplating work on a novel on a great landowner. In 1900 he had entertained the idea of a book of epic dimensions ‚Äì like Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace ‚Äì except set in France in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, beginning at the time of the Marshall Mac-Mahon's \\"coup d'√©tat\\" on May 16, 1877. However, the three chapters published by his widow, the former actress Alice Regnault, are discontinued on the eve of the coup... Apparently, the undertaking that Mirbeau envisaged soon appeared to him to be one that exceeded his capabilities, and also was one that would be at odds with his own evolving views on the novel. Whereas Mirbeau had been increasingly drawn to unconventional plot narratives, disorienting because of their equivocal meaning and lack of linear structure (see Torture Garden and Les Vingt et un Jours d'un neurasth√©nique), his new project would require him to supply an abundance of explanatory background to contextualize the contemporary history his book was to treat, as if such historical reality was really accessible at all.  A confession-novel  The principal interest of Mirbeau's three completed chapters comes because they refocused the novelist on his own literary origins. Like Mirbeau, his protagonist-narrative, Charles Varnat, enters, as a personal secretary, into the service of a Normand country squire, the Marquis d'Amblezy-S√©rac, a man of vast political ambition. Mirbeau's story serves as a pretext for him to return to the years when he himself had been obliged to earn his daily bread by hiring his pen out to a succession of employers. These experiences had left Mirbeau embittered by memories of his humiliation and frustration. Here again, as in the articles and stories dating from the 1880s, Mirbeau likens the lot of this intellectual proletariat to prostitution, and compares the life of a personal secretary to that of a servant, albeit an even more degraded one.

Signed under the pseudonym Nirvana, they were not collected in a volume until 1991.  Literary hoax  Given that Mirbeau never set foot in India, his work is nothing more than a masterful literary hoax. It was actually in Paris that Mirbeau wrote the first seven letters, centering on Ceylon and Pondicherry, and then in the Orne, near L'Aigle, where, while contemplating the rhododendrons of Normandy, he pictured in the last four letters the twelve- meter high rhododendrons of the Himalayas, glimpsed in an apocryphal trek across Sikkim. Cartoon of Fran√ßois Deloncle, Le Don Quichotte, 11 September 1892 Mirbeau‚Äôs original motivation had been to outdo Gaulois journalist Robert de Bonni√®res, in Mirbeau's view a pretentious man of the world who himself had undertaken a genuine journey through India, from which he had sent back his travel memories, first published in La Revue bleue and then collected in 1880 as M√©moires d‚Äôaujourd‚Äôhui (Memoirs of Today). However, Mirbeau's text is also a ghost-written work written out of financial necessity, as he set in literary form, embellishing and enlivening them, dispatches by his friend Fran√ßois Deloncle, who had been sent on an official mission to India by Jules Ferry. These reports have been preserved in the archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  A good colonialism ?  A true member of the literary proletariat, Octave Mirbeau, at the time, still did not enjoy the freedom to publish under his own name, continuing to write under the ‚Äúinfluence‚Äù of others. The future critic of colonialism who would picture entire continents as terrifying ‚Äútorture gardens‚Äù, was still compelled to contrast the ‚Äúgood‚Äù colonialism of the French, professing respect for foreign peoples and their cultures, with the ‚Äúbad‚Äù colonialism of the English, with their cynical oppression of the peoples of India. Beyond having to compromise the integrity of his views for these reasons, Mirbeau was still aware of the upheavals looming in the East. In the book, Mirbeau reveals his fascination for Indian civilization, rooted in detachment, renunciation of material attachments, and stillness of the mind. Mirbeau was similarly interested in Cingalese Buddhism, which he presents as a religion without God and that could liberate man‚Äôs thinking and rid it of fanaticism.

The assault was also, the opposition claimed, supported by Syrian Air Force jets. On 1 October, the Syrian Army took control of Rastan, killing 120 civilians and opposition soldiers according to opposition sources and arresting 3,000 suspected opposition members. Aftermath Insurgent activity continued in the area for months after the major clashes ended. On 24 November, the military conducted an operation in Rastan, during which they killed 16 gunmen and captured a large cache of weapons.

History  The building in 2008 The name H√¥pital g√©n√©ral des fr√®res Charron () refers to a French religious community of the same name. It focused on care of the poor. The hospital was built outside the Fortifications of Montreal in 1695. Management and hospital administration were entrusted to the Grey Nuns in 1747. The hospital suffered a major fire in 1765 and was rebuilt again according to the style of French architecture, that is to say, with large walls composed of rough stone called rubble that had been squared and covered in plaster. The architecture, which is very utilitarian, is rudimentary and has little ornamentation. The gable roof prevents the accumulation of snow in winter. The structure, being less massive and simpler to build meant a lower risk of fire. Finally, esses are used to reinforce the structure with stems screwed into the wood frame. In 1880, the nuns decided to rent the building in order to maintain administrative offices in their communities. In 1971, the Grey Nuns decided to return to their first mother-house.

Many local clubs and national or regional federations were influential in history. The importance of some local clubs is demonstrated by their women's club buildings being listed on historic registries. In the United States, the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC) became the primary umbrella organization of women's clubs in the United States. \\"For the later part of the nineteenth century and much of the twentieth century, the women's clubs were an essential vehicle for women's activity outside of the home.\\" and In New Mexico alone, a state federation grew to include 59 clubs. In Australia, the Country Women's Association had numerous clubs. Most historical women's clubs served social and charitable purposes, most of which may seem relatively uncontroversial today. These purposes have included voluntary civic service purposes such as: *opening lending libraries and seeking funding to create permanent public libraries *pursuing historic preservation *advocating for women's suffrage, other rights for women *campaigning against lynching and Jim Crow laws *serving as professional women's clubs, comparable to historic men's clubs of London *serving as athletic clubs or otherwise supporting sports, physical activity *addressing sanitation and health issues *hosting social activities, including card games *hosting lectures and otherwise engaging in education *addressing employment and labor conditions Some women's groups with a more activist political orientation which used \\"club\\" in their name, such as perhaps the Alpha Suffrage Club which fought for black female suffrage in Chicago, are included here, too.

It is located on Sherbrooke Street East in the borough of Ville-Marie, across from La Fontaine Park. It was established in 1880, and has been at its present site since 1924. History Around 1880, Universit√© Laval √† Montr√©al decided to found a hospital. The secretary of Universit√© Laval √† Montr√©al, Dr. Emmanuel Persillier-Lachapelle, was given the mandate to establish the new health institution, assisted by the Sulpician Victor Rousselot, parish priest of Notre-Dame, as well as Mother Julie Haineault-Deschamps, of the Congregation of the Grey Nuns. H√¥pital Notre-Dame opened on July 27, 1880, housed on the former premises of Donegana's Hotel on Notre-Dame Street. From the beginning, the hospital was a secular institution. It was administered by physicians rather than priests, which was considered innovative for its time. In the late nineteenth century, H√¥pital Notre-Dame became one of the largest hospitals in the country, with six specialized departments: general practitioners, surgery, psychiatry, otolaryngology, ophthalmology and electrotherapy. In 1898, sister √âlodie Mailloux founded the first French Canadian nursing school at the hospital. During its existence, the school trained over 3000 graduates. The first intervention asepsis in Canada was conducted at H√¥pital Notre-Dame in 1899. H√¥pital Notre-Dame has been associated with Universit√© de Montreal since its establishment in 1920. In 1924 the H√¥pital Notre-Dame moved into the space it currently occupies on Sherbrooke Street. In 1996, the merger of the H√¥tel- Dieu de Montr√©al, the H√¥pital Notre-Dame and the H√¥pital Saint-Luc followed the creation of the Centre hospitalier de l‚ÄôUniversit√© de Montr√©al (CHUM). With the completion of the CHUM megahospital in downtown Montreal in 2017, H√¥pital Notre-Dame is slated to remain open as a local hospital.  1934 Internes Strike  On 14 June 1934, the internes at Notre-Dame commenced Canada's first medical strike to protest the appointment of a \\"Hebrew\\", Dr. Sam Rabinovitch, to the staff. Dr. Rabinovich was the highest ranking graduate of his class from the Universit√© de Montr√©al, and was offered the position of chief intern. In early June 1934 a petition signed by doctors and interns of Notre-Dame was submitted to the hospitals board, requesting that the contract between the Hospital and Rabinovich be \\"broken\\". After a lengthy deliberation by the hospital board it was decided to uphold the contract and hire Rabinovitch Thirtytwo resident doctors walked off the job rather than work with Rabinovich, and by the 17th of June the strike had expanded to include interns from five other Montreal hospitals, with nurses threatening to join the strike. Quebec Nationalist groups and media such as The Saint-Jean- Baptiste Society and Le Devoir quickly backed the striking internes. Rabinovitch formally resigned from his position on 18 June. The culmination of this and other antisemitism events led the Jewish community in Quebec to create their own hospital. Funds for the new Jewish General Hospital were obtained through charitable drives headed by Allan Bronfman, Sir Mortimer Davis and J.W. McConnell from the Jewish and Protestant communities. Pavillon Mailloux View of front entrance of Pavillon Mailloux The Pavillon Mailloux is a five-storey brick nurses‚Äô residence on the campus of the H√¥pital Notre-Dame. It was constructed as a purpose-built residence in 1931.

It is known, however, that humans can perceive sounds below this frequency at very high pressure levels. Infrasound can come from many natural as well as man-made sources, including weather patterns, topographic features, ocean wave activity, thunderstorms, geomagnetic storms, earthquakes, jet streams, mountain ranges, and rocket launchings. Infrasounds are also present in the vocalizations of some animals. Low frequency sounds can travel for long distances with very little attenuation and can be detected hundreds of miles away from their sources.  Mammals  The production and perception of infrasound has been observed in multiple mammals, including whale, elephant, giraffe, hippopotamus, and rhinoceros. For most of these animals, observations are preliminary and their sensitivity to infrasound has not been quantified. If an animal produces a low frequency sound, and uses it in communication, it suggests the animal might also be sensitive to infrasound.  Elephants  Elephants are the terrestrial animal in which the production of infrasonic calls was first noted by M. Krishnan, later discovered by Katy Payne. The use of low frequency sounds to communicate over long distances may explain certain elephant behaviors that have previously puzzled observers. Elephant groups that are separated by several kilometers have been observed to travel in parallel or to change the direction simultaneously and move directly towards each other in order to meet. The time of estrus for females is asynchronous, lasts only for a few days, and occurs only every several years. Nevertheless, males, which usually wander apart from female groups, rapidly gather from many directions to compete for a receptive female. Since infrasound can travel for very long distances, it has been suggested that calls in the infrasonic range might be important for long distance communication for such coordinated behaviors among separated elephants. = Infrasound production and perception = Recordings and playback experiments support that elephants use the infrasonic components of their calls for communication. Infrasonic vocalizations have been recorded from captive elephants in many different situations. The structure of the calls varies greatly but most of them range in frequency from 14 to 24 Hz, with durations of 10‚Äì15 seconds. When the nearest elephant is 5 m from the microphone, the recorded sound pressure levels can be 85 to 90 dB SPL. Some of these calls are completely inaudible to humans, while others have audible components that are probably due to higher frequency harmonics of below 20 Hz fundamentals. Sometimes, vocalizations cause perceptible rumbles that are accompanied by a fluttering of the skin on the calling elephant's forehead where the nasal passage enters the skull. This fluttering can also occur without causing any perceptible sound, suggesting the production of a purely infrasonic call. The mechanism of infrasonic call production in elephants has not been determined. Playback experiments using prerecorded elephant vocalizations show that elephants can perceive infrasound and how they respond to these stimuli. In playback experiments, certain behaviors that occur commonly after vocalizations are scored before and after a call is played. These behaviors include lifting and stiffening of ears, vocalization, walking or running towards the concealed speaker, clustering in a tight group, and remaining motionless (\\"freezing\\"), with occasional scanning movements of the head. The occurrence of such behaviors consistently increases after the playing of a call, whether it is a full-bandwidth playback or a playback in which most of the energy above 25 Hz was filtered out. This filtering shows that the behaviorally significant information of the call is contained in the infrasonic range, and it also simulates the effect of frequency-dependent attenuation over distance as it might occur in the wild. Behavioral responses do not increase for pure tone stimuli that are similar to recorded infrasonic calls in frequency and intensity. This shows that the responses are specifically to signals that were meaningful to the elephants. The use of prerecorded playbacks and behavioral scoring also shows that the infrasonic elephant calls are behaviorally significant over long distances. The degree of response behaviors performed by an elephant group, such as lifting of ears, walking towards the speakers, ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù, or scanning movements, was compared visually before and after the presentation of a stimulus, scoring a trial as a positive response if the amount of behaviors is greater after the stimulus. In one particular experiment performed on elephants living in the wild, the presentation of playbacks for 20‚Äì40 seconds from loudspeakers at distances of 1.2 km and 2 km caused a significant increase in response behaviors. Since the playbacks were done at half the amplitude at which they were recorded, it is estimated that these calls would be perceptible by elephants at distances of at least 4 km Even this may be an underestimate because animals do not respond every time they perceive a conspecific call, and they are probably less likely to respond to calls from further distances even if they do perceive them. There are some confounding factors that might influence the results of this kind of experiment. Firstly, the animals might actually be more sensitive than the experiments would indicate owing to habituation of the animals to the playback stimuli after several trial repetitions. To avoid this, researchers present several different types of playbacks in random order. Another problem that might arise in interpreting field experiments done on groups of animals is that animals may be responding to signals from other elephants in the group rather than the playback stimulus. However, an assumption is made that at least one animal in the group did perceive and respond directly to the stimulus. = Infrasound sensitivity = The auditory sensitivity thresholds have been measured behaviorally for one individual young female Indian elephant. The conditioning test for sensitivity requires the elephant to respond to a stimulus by pressing a button with its trunk, which results in a sugar water reward if the elephant correctly identified the appropriate stimulus occurrence. To determine auditory sensitivity thresholds, a certain frequency of sound is presented at various intensities to see at which intensity the stimulus ceases to evoke a response. The auditory sensitivity curve of this particular elephant began at 16 Hz with a threshold of 65 dB. A shallow slope decreased to the best response at 1 kHz with a threshold of 8 dB, followed by a steep threshold increase above 4 kHz. According to the 60 dB cut-off, the upper limit was 10.5 kHz with absolutely no detectable response at 14 kHz. The upper limit for humans is considered to be 18 kHz. The upper and lower limits of elephant hearing are the lowest measured for any animals aside from the pigeon. By contrast, the average best frequency for animal hearing is 9.8 kHz, the average upper limit is 55 kHz. The ability to differentiate frequencies of two successive tones was also tested for this elephant using a similar conditioning paradigm. The elephant's responses were somewhat erratic, which is typical for mammals in this test. Nevertheless, the ability to discriminate sounds was best at frequencies below 1 kHz particularly at measurements of 500 Hz and 250 Hz. Tests of the ability to localize sounds also showed the significance of low frequency sound perception in elephants. Localization was tested by observing the successful orienting towards the left or the right source loudspeakers when they were positioned at different angles from the elephant's head. The elephant could localize sounds best at a frequency below 1 kHz, with perfect identification of the left or right speaker at angles of 20 degrees or more, and chance level discriminations below 2 degrees. Sound localization ability was measured to be best at 125 Hz and 250 Hz, intermediate at 500 Hz, 1 kHz, and 2 kHz, and very poor at frequencies at 4 kHz and above. A possible reason for this is that elephants are very good at using interaural phase differences which are effective for localizing low frequency sounds, but not as good at using interaural intensity differences which are better for higher frequency sounds. Because of the elephant head size and the large distance between their ears, interaural difference cues become confused when wavelengths are shorter, explaining why sound localization was very poor at frequencies above 4 kHz. It was observed that the elephant spread the pinna of its ears only during the sound localization tasks, however the precise effect of this behavior is unknown.  Birds  Although birds do not produce vocalizations in the infrasonic range, reactions to infrasonic stimuli have been observed in several species, such as the homing pigeon, the guinea fowl, and the Asian grouse. It is postulated that birds might use the detection of naturally occurring infrasound for long-range directional cues from distant landmarks, or for weather detection. Since hearing tests at infrasonic frequencies have been conducted on a small number of bird species, the true diversity of this ability among birds is unknown .  Pigeons  Infrasound perception has been observed and quantified in the homing pigeon which has particularly good long distance navigation skills. The precise relevance of such signals for the pigeon is still unknown, but several uses for infrasound have been hypothesized, such as navigation and detection of air turbulences when flying and landing. = Infrasound sensitivity = In experiments using heart-rate conditioning, pigeons have been found to be able to detect sounds in the infrasonic range at frequencies as low as 0.5 Hz. For frequencies below 10 Hz, the pigeon threshold is at about 55 dB which is at least 50 dB more sensitive than humans. Pigeons are able to discriminate small frequency differences in sounds at between 1 Hz and 20 Hz, with sensitivity ranging from a 1% shift at 20 Hz to a 7% shift at 1 Hz. Sensitivities are measured through a heart-rate conditioning test. In this test, an anesthetized bird is presented with a single sound or a sequence of sounds, followed by an electric shock. The bird's heart-rate will increase in anticipation of a shock. Therefore, a measure of the heart-rate can determine whether the bird is able to distinguish between stimuli that would be followed by a shock from stimuli that would not. Similar methods have also been used to determine the pigeon's sensitivity to barometric pressure changes, polarized light, and UV light. These experiments were conducted in sound isolation chambers to avoid the influence of ambient noise. Infrasonic stimuli are hard to produce and are often transmitted through a filter that attenuates higher frequency components. Also, the tone burst stimuli used in these experiments were presented with stimulus onset and offsets ramped on and off gradually in order to prevent initial turn-on and turn-off transients. In order to use infrasound for navigation, it is necessary to be able to localize the source of the sounds. The known mechanisms for sound localizations make use of the time difference cues at the two ears. However, infrasound has such long wavelengths that these mechanisms would not be effective for an animal the size of a pigeon. An alternative method that has been hypothesized is through the use of the Doppler shift. A Doppler shift occurs when there is relative motion between a sound source and a perceiver and slightly shifts the perceived frequency of the sound. When a flying bird is changing direction, the amplitude of the Doppler shift between it and an infrasonic source would change, enabling the bird to locate the source. This kind of mechanism would require the ability to detect very small changes in frequency. A pigeon typically flies at 20 km/hr, so a turn could cause up to a 12% modulation of an infrasonic stimulus. According to response measurements, pigeons are able to distinguish frequency changes of 1-7% in the infrasonic range, showing that the use of Doppler shifts for infrasound localization may be within the pigeon's perceptive capabilities. In early experiments with infrasound sensitivity in pigeons, surgical removal of the columella, a bone that links the tympanic membrane to the inner ear, in each ear severely reduced the ability to respond to infrasound, increasing the sensitivity threshold by about 50 dB. Complete surgical removal of the entire cochlea, lagena, and columellae completely abolished any response to infrasound. This shows that the receptors for infrasonic stimuli may be located in the inner ear. = Infrasound sensitive nerve fibers = Neural fibers that are sensitive to infrasonic stimuli have been identified in the pigeon and their characteristics have been studied. It turns out that, although these fibers also originate in the inner ear, they are quite different from normal acoustic fibers. Infrasound sensitive fibers have very high rates of spontaneous discharge, with a mean of 115imp/s, which is much higher than the spontaneous discharge of other auditory fibers. Recordings show that discharge rates do not increase in response to infrasound stimuli but are modulated at levels comparable to the behavioral thresholds. Modulation depth is dependent on stimulus frequency and intensity. The modulation is phase locked so that the discharge rate increases during one phase of the stimulus and decreases during the other, leaving the mean discharge rate constant. Such pulse-frequency modulation allows the stimulus analysis to be independent of the peripheral tuning of the basilar membrane or the hair cells, which is already poor at low auditory frequencies. Unlike other acoustic fibers, infrasonic fibers do not show any indication of being tuned to a particular characteristic frequency. By injecting fibers that were identified to be sensitive to infrasound with HRP (Horseradish Peroxidase), the location and morphology of the stained fibers can be observed in sections under a microscope. Infrasound sensitive fibers are found to be simple bipolar cells in the auditory ganglion with a diameter of 1.6-2.2 ¬µm at the axon and 0.9-1.2 ¬µm at the dendrites. They originate in the apical end of the cochlea and they are located near fibers that transmit low frequency sounds in the acoustic range. Unlike the ordinary acoustic fibers which terminate on the neural limbus, the infrasonic ones terminate on cells on the free basilar membrane. Furthermore, infrasonic fibers terminate on 2-9 hair cells while normal acoustic fibers connect to only one. Such characteristics would make these fibers analogous to fibers connecting to the outer hair cells in mammals, except that mammalian outer hair cells are known to have efferent fibers only and no afferents. These observations suggest that the infrasound sensitive fibers are in a class separate from ordinary acoustic fibers.  References   Further reading  *Cook, R.K. (1969) Atmospheric sound propagation.

This track is under the jurisdiction of Bangladesh Railway History Dhaka Kamalapur railway station Dhaka Bimanbandor railway station Intercity Tista Express that runs between Dhaka and Bahdurabad Ghat Mymensingh railway station The Dacca State Railway opened the long metre gauge railway from Narayanganj to Mymensingh via Dhaka in 1884‚Äì1885. This line was meant primarily for the collection of jute and its onward dispatch to Kolkata, then known as Calcutta. It was also used by passengers to and from Kolkata, making way from Narayanganj and vice versa to Goalundo Ghat which was connected to Kolkata by rail in 1871. The launch from Goalundo Ghat to Narayanganj, across the Padma, traversed the course in about seven hours. The line was extended for another to Jagannathganj Ghat, on the east bank of the Jamuna, soon after its opening. The Bahadurabad Ghat‚ÄìJamalpur (also known as Singjhani) metre gauge line was opened in 1912, connecting it to another point on the Jamuna. The line from Santahar to Fulchhari (Tistamukhghat), on the west bank of the Jamuna, opened during 1899‚Äì1900. It was connected to Bahadurabad by ferry. The 80-km long Iswardi-Sirajganj section was commissioned in 1916, connected it to another point on the Jamuna. This was connected to Jagannathganj Ghat by ferry. The ferries were operated by the railways. The construction of this track opened up the possibilities of linking such places as Gouripur, Kishoreganj, Bhairab Bazar and Mohanganj through branch lines. Ferries at Bahadurabad Ghat and Jagannathganj Ghat In Bangladesh, ferries are often an integrated part of the railway system. There were two major ferry points across the Jamuna, one between Bahadurabad Ghat and Tistamukh Ghat and the other between Jagannath Ghat and Sirajganj Ghat. The ferry system had reached the limits of its capacity. While marginal capacity additions were still feasible, to cope with any significant increase in capacity or even normal traffic growth was virtually felt to be impossible. The construction of the Bangabandhu Bridge has completely changed the scope of communication systems in this part of the country. The ferry system at both the Bahadurabad Ghat‚ÄìBalashi Ghat and the Jagannathganj Ghat-Sirajganj Ghat was virtually closed. Only limited freight transportation continued on the Bahadurabad Ghat-Balashi section. Even that has been closed down in 2010 because of formation of shoal in the river. As of 2010, the Teesta Express runs from Dhaka to Bahadurabad on all days except Monday when it terminates at Dewanganj. The Brahmaputra Express terminates at Dewanganj Bazar. There are a number of other trains terminating at Dewanganj. The Mymensingh Express terminates at Jagannathganj Ghat. The Jamuna Express terminates at Tarakandi. Locale This line followed the old channel of the Brahmaputra River, right from its point of separation with the Jamuna down to the mouth of the Shitalakshya River, a branch of the Brahmaputra. Tangail Tangail is on the Dhaka Cantonment-Iswardi broad gauge line. There are numerous buses from all around. According to the Mymensingh Gazetteer of 1917, Tangail used to be more difficult to reach: \\"At present travellers from Mymensingh to Tangail usually go by train to Jagannathganj, steamer to Porabari, and then 12 miles by country boat, bicycle or horse.\\" Kishoreganj The Mymensingh‚ÄìBhairab Bazar Railway Company constructed the Mymensingh‚ÄìGouripur‚ÄìKishoreganj‚ÄìBhairab Bazar Line between 1912 and 1918.

Twenty DEMU sets were purchased from Chinese manufacturer CRRC Tangshan for Tk 460 crore (US$59 million as of 2013). Each set consists of three carriages, with the engines incorporated into the ones on either end, and has a capacity of 149 seated passengers and 151 standing passengers. Eighteen months later, the Dhaka Tribune characterized the DEMU service as \\"a lemon\\" because travel time was little better than conventional service, carriages had inadequate ventilation, and there was a three-foot mismatch between carriage door and station platform heights.

Overview  From almost the beginning, Hollywood also got in on the action and produced a number of extremely lurid hippie exploitation films masquerading as cautionary public service announcements, but which were in fact aimed directly at feeding a morbid public appetite while pretending to take a moral stance. Often depicting drug-crazed hippies living and freaking out in \\"Manson family\\" style communes, such films as The Hallucination Generation (1967) and Riot on Sunset Strip (1967) depicted \\"hippie\\" youths running wild in an orgy of group sex, drugs, crime and even murder.\\" Other examples include The Love-ins, Psych-Out, The Trip, and Wild in the Streets. One of the strangest of these films is the horror film I Drink Your Blood. Loosely inspired by Charles Manson's \\"family\\", the film follows a group of nomadic Satanist hippies when they ride into a small town and terrorize the inhabitants. The town has largely become a ghost town thanks to a large mining project nearby, and all but a couple of houses are abandoned. A young local girl is badly beaten. Her grandfather confronts the group but is attacked and dosed with LSD.  Main examples  *Hallucination Generation is a 1967 film by Edward Mann. Purportedly intended as a warning against the dangers of pill-popping Sixties hedonism along the lines of 1936's Reefer Madness, the film's primary purpose appears to have been titillation, thus landing it in the genre of exploitation cinema. The film is a drama set in Spain where a small group of American young adults is living. The leader of the group is a drug dealer. The others are there living carefree lives as beatniks. The leader has more nefarious aims in mind, and uses drugs to lure the others into lives of crime. Most of the film is in black and white, but there is a psychedelic sequence depicting the purported effects of the group using LSD which was filmed in color. *Riot on Sunset Strip is a 1967 low-budget exploitation movie, released by American International Pictures, and filmed and released within six weeks of the actual late-1966 Sunset Strip curfew riots. Along with the attempt to capture the essence of the period around the Sunset Strip riots, a subplot of the movie revolves around a young girl (Mimsy Farmer)'s troubled relationship with her divorced parents (Ray and Hortense Petra). Her dosage with LSD by a would-be seductor, the subsequent 'acid trip' she experiences, and her later discovery by Ray (a police sergeant) as the victim of gang rape, are among the movie's peak moments. *The Love-Ins is a 1967 exploitation film about LSD that was directed by Arthur Dreifuss. The film is loosely based on the 1960s American figure, Timothy Leary and represents the 1960s San Francisco scene, particularly that of the Haight-Ashbury district. The plot basically centers around a Timothy Leary-type figure becoming the head of a cult-like following of hippies who all enjoy the effects of LSD. The production seems to be a typical representation of the producer Sam Katzman's work. The film featured a number of different musical acts popular at the time. The themes dealt with drug use and martyrdom. The film was generally poorly received, with a few exceptions. *Psych-Out (1968) is a feature film about hippies, psychedelic music, and recreational drugs, produced and released by American International Pictures. Jenny (played by Susan Strasberg) is a deaf runaway who arrives in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district, searching for her brother Steve. She encounters the aptly named Stoney (Jack Nicholson) and his hippie band \\"Mumblin' Jim\\" in a coffee shop. The group discovers an artist friend, Warren (Henry Jaglom), the man who designs the psychedelic posters advertising the band, freaking out badly in his gallery, apparently on STP. *I Love You, Alice B. Toklas is a 1968 film released by Warner Brothers. Attorney Harold Fine (Peter Sellers) is set to marry his longtime girlfriend Joyce, but is having deep second thoughts. He encounters his brother, a hippie living in Venice Beach, and falls for an attractive flower power hippie girl (played by Leigh Taylor-Young) who has a knack for making pot brownies. Harold ends up running out of his wedding to live with the hippie girl and attempts to find himself as well with the aid of a guru. *The Trip (1967) is a cult film released by American International Pictures, directed by Roger Corman, written by Jack Nicholson, and shot on location in and around Los Angeles, including on top of Kirkwood in Laurel Canyon, Hollywood Hills, and near Big Sur, California in 1966. Peter Fonda stars as a young television commercial director, Paul Groves. In this drama, Paul Groves (Peter Fonda) takes his first dose of LSD while experiencing the heartbreak and ambivalence of divorce from his beautiful but adulterous wife, played by Susan Strasberg. He starts his trip with a \\"guide,\\" John (Bruce Dern), but runs away and abandons out of fear. *Wild in the Streets is a 1968 film featuring Christopher Jones, Hal Holbrook, and Shelley Winters. The movie, described as both \\"ludicrous\\" and \\"cautionary,\\" was nominated for an Academy Award and became a cult classic. As teens either take over or threaten the reins of government, the Old Guard (those over 30) turn to Max to run for president, and assert his (their) control over the changing tide. Max again agrees, running as a Republican to his chagrin, but once in office, he turns the tide on his older supporters. With youth now in control of the United States, politically as well as economically, and similar revolutions breaking out in all the world's major countries, Max withdraws the military from around the world (turning them instead into de facto age police), puts computers and prodigies in charge of the Gross National Product, ships surplus grain for free to third world nations, disbands the FBI and Secret Service, and becomes the leader of \\"the most truly hedonistic society the world has ever known\\". *The Big Cube is a 1969 Warner Bros. thriller directed by Tito Davison and starring Lana Turner, Karin Mossberg (in her first and only role), George Chakiris, Dan O'Herlihy and Richard Egan; it was one of Lana Turner's last movies. It is notable for its aggressive portrayal of LSD use and the 1960s youth counterculture as vicious evils. *I Drink Your Blood is a cult horror film originally released in 1970. The film was written and directed by David E. Durston, produced by Jerry Gross, and starred Bhaskar Roy Chowdhury and Lynn Lowry (who is uncredited in the film).10 Strange Things You'd Better Not Eat or Drink!

The scale model is typically constructed in the laboratory and then loaded onto the end of the centrifuge, which is typically between in radius. The purpose of spinning the models on the centrifuge is to increase the g-forces on the model so that stresses in the model are equal to stresses in the prototype. For example, the stress beneath a layer of model soil spun at a centrifugal acceleration of 50 g produces stresses equivalent to those beneath a prototype layer of soil in earth's gravity. The idea to use centrifugal acceleration to simulate increased gravitational acceleration was first proposed by Phillips (1869). Pokrovsky and Fedorov (1936) in the Soviet Union and Bucky (1931) in the United States were the first to implement the idea. Andrew N. Schofield (e.g. Schofield 1980) played a key role in modern development of centrifuge modeling. Principles of centrifuge modeling Typical applications Model of a port structure loaded on the UC Davis centrifuge A geotechnical centrifuge is used to test models of geotechnical problems such as the strength, stiffness and capacity of foundations for bridges and buildings, settlement of embankments, stability of slopes, earth retaining structures, tunnel stability and seawalls. Other applications include explosive cratering, contaminant migration in ground water, frost heave and sea ice. The centrifuge may be useful for scale modeling of any large-scale nonlinear problem for which gravity is a primary driving force. Reason for model testing on the centrifuge Geotechnical materials such as soil and rock have non-linear mechanical properties that depend on the effective confining stress and stress history. The centrifuge applies an increased \\"gravitational\\" acceleration to physical models in order to produce identical self-weight stresses in the model and prototype. The one to one scaling of stress enhances the similarity of geotechnical models and makes it possible to obtain accurate data to help solve complex problems such as earthquake-induced liquefaction, soil-structure interaction and underground transport of pollutants such as dense non-aqueous phase liquids. Centrifuge model testing provides data to improve our understanding of basic mechanisms of deformation and failure and provides benchmarks useful for verification of numerical models. Scaling laws Note that in this article, the asterisk on any quantity represents the scale factor for that quantity. For example, in x^* = \\\\frac{x_{m}} {x_{p}}, the subscript m represents \\"model\\" and the subscript p represents \\"prototype\\" and x^* \\\\, represents the scale factor for the quantity x \\\\, (Garnier et al. 2007). The reason for spinning a model on a centrifuge is to enable small scale models to feel the same effective stresses as a full-scale prototype. This goal can be stated mathematically as :\\\\sigma'^* = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma'_{m}} {\\\\sigma'_{p}} = 1 where the asterisk represents the scaling factor for the quantity, \\\\sigma'_{m} is the effective stress in the model and \\\\sigma'_{p} is the effective stress in the prototype. In soil mechanics the vertical effective stress, \\\\sigma' for example, is typically calculated by :\\\\sigma' = \\\\sigma^t - u\\\\, where \\\\sigma^t is the total stress and u is the pore pressure. For a uniform layer with no pore pressure, the total vertical stress at a depth H may be calculated by: :\\\\sigma^t = \\\\rho g H \\\\, where \\\\rho represents the density of the layer and g represents gravity. In the conventional form of centrifuge modeling (Garnier et al. 2007), it is typical that the same materials are used in the model and prototype; therefore the densities are the same in model and prototype, i.e., : \\\\rho^* = 1 \\\\, Furthermore, in conventional centrifuge modeling all lengths are scaled by the same factor L^*. To produce the same stress in the model as in the prototype, we thus require \\\\rho^*g^*H^* = (1)g^*L^* = 1 \\\\,, which may be rewritten as :g^* = \\\\frac{1} {L^*} The above scaling law states that if lengths in the model are reduced by some factor, n, then gravitational accelerations must be increased by the same factor, n in order to preserve equal stresses in model and prototype. =Dynamic problems= For dynamic problems where gravity and accelerations are important, all accelerations must scale as gravity is scaled, i.e. :a^* = g^* = \\\\frac{1} {L^*} Since acceleration has units of \\\\frac{L} {T^2}, it is required that :a^* = \\\\frac{L^*} {T^{*2}} Hence it is required that :\\\\frac{1} {L^*} = \\\\frac{L^*} {T^{*2}}, or :T^* = L^* \\\\, Frequency has units of inverse of time, velocity has units of length per time, so for dynamic problems we also obtain :f^* = \\\\frac{1} {L{*}} :v^* = \\\\frac{L^*} {T{*}} = 1 =Diffusion problems= :T^* = L^{*2} \\\\, For model tests involving both dynamics and diffusion, the conflict in time scale factors may be resolved by scaling the permeability of the soil (Garnier et al. 2007) =Scaling of other quantitites= (this section obviously needs work!) scale factors for energy, force, pressure, acceleration, velocity, etc. Note that stress has units of pressure, or force per unit area. Thus we can show that Substituting F = m‚àôa (Newton's law, force = mass ‚àô acceleration) and r = m/L3 (from the definition of mass density). Scale factors for many other quantities can be derived from the above relationships. The table below summarizes common scale factors for centrifuge testing. Scale Factors for Centrifuge Model Tests (from Garnier et al. 2007) (Table is suggested to be added here) Value of centrifuge in geotechnical earthquake engineering Schematic of a model containing piles in sloping ground. The dimensions are given in prototype scale. For this experiment the scale factor was 30 or 50. Excavation of a centrifuge model after liquefaction and lateral spreading. Large earthquakes are infrequent and unrepeatable but they can be devastating. All of these factors make it difficult to obtain the required data to study their effects by post earthquake field investigations. Instrumentation of full scale structures is expensive to maintain over the large periods of time that may elapse between major temblors, and the instrumentation may not be placed in the most scientifically useful locations. Even if engineers are lucky enough to obtain timely recordings of data from real failures, there is no guarantee that the instrumentation is providing repeatable data. In addition, scientifically educational failures from real earthquakes come at the expense of the safety of the public. Understandably, after a real earthquake, most of the interesting data is rapidly cleared away before engineers have an opportunity to adequately study the failure modes. Centrifuge modeling is a valuable tool for studying the effects of ground shaking on critical structures without risking the safety of the public. The efficacy of alternative designs or seismic retrofitting techniques can compared in a repeatable scientific series of tests. Verification of numerical models Centrifuge tests can also be used to obtain experimental data to verify a design procedure or a computer model. The rapid development of computational power over recent decades has revolutionized engineering analysis. Many computer models have been developed to predict the behavior of geotechnical structures during earthquakes and other loads. Before a computer model can be used with confidence, it must be proven to be valid based on evidence. The meager and unrepeatable data provided by natural earthquakes, for example, is usually insufficient for this purpose. Verification of the validity of assumptions made by a computational algorithm is especially important in the area of geotechnical engineering due to the complexity of soil behavior. Soils exhibit highly non-linear behavior, their strength and stiffness depend on their stress history and on the water pressure in the pore fluid, all of which may evolve during the loading caused by an earthquake. The computer models which are intended to simulate these phenomena are very complex and require extensive verification. Experimental data from centrifuge tests is useful for verifying assumptions made by a computational algorithm. If the results show the computer model to be inaccurate, the centrifuge test data provides insight into the physical processes which in turn stimulates the development of better computer models.

It is native to North America, where it is widespread and abundant in much of Canada and the western and central United States. There are two subspecies, ssp. lanceolatus occurring throughout the species' range and ssp. psammophilus occurring in the Great Lakes region.Scher, Janette S. (2002). Elymus lanceolatus. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. Retrieved 12-20-2011. Elymus lanceolatus is a perennial, low growing, rhizomatous grass that actively grows in summer and spring. This plant is native to semiarid regions of the United StatesHumphrey DL, Pyke DA (2001) Ramet spacing of Elymus lanceolatus (thickspike wheatgrass) in response to neighbor density. Canadian Journal of Botany 79(9): 1122 ‚Äì1126.. Elymus lanceolatus is polymorphic, capable of growing in high altitude regions of the Rocky Mountains or at sea level near the Great Lakes in the United States. The bloom period for E. lanceolatus is mid-spring, and it is available commercially. Elymus lanceolatus is characterized by its yellow flowers, green or grey leaves, and brown seeds. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), it has a moderate harvest regrowth rate. Wheatgrass is unique in that in can adapt to fine, medium, and coarsely textured soils in the environment. However, it is shade intolerant, has a medium fertility requirement, and has a medium salinity tolerance. Studies suggest that amounts of soil needed for wheatgrass harvest can be approximated by understanding the plant‚Äôs water depletion rate and rainfall amount in the region, which consequently helps reduce drainage.Anderson JE, Shumar ML, Toft NL, Nowak RS (1987) Control of the soil water balance by sagebrush and three perennial grasses in a cold-desert environment. Arid Soil Research and Rehabilitation 4(1): 229-244. This grass produces hollow, erect stems up to tall. The grass grows from a dense network of roots and rhizomes thickly intertwined to form a sod. The leaves are up to long and wide and are flat or slightly rolled at the edges. In dry, hot weather the leaves roll completely into cylindrical shapes. The inflorescence is a narrow, compact spike at the top of the stem, measuring up to long. Each spikelet may have 2 to 11 flowers. The plant reproduces often by seed but in some areas, particularly in sandy substrates, it reproduces vegetatively by sprouting from its rhizome. New plants sprout from a soil seed bank, the seeds surviving in the soil for 3 to 4 years on average. The plant thrives under irrigation or in areas with 200-500 millimeters (8-20 inches) of annual precipitation. This grass is common and dominant in a number of habitat types in all stages of ecological succession. It can be found in forests, woodlands, sagebrush, shrubsteppe, desert, sandy lakeshores and sand dunes, and a wide variety of grassland and prairie ecosystems. It takes hold easily in disturbed areas such as roadsides. Though it rarely forms large monotypic stands, small pure stands of the species are common. It is highly drought- resistant and tolerant of wildfire and grazing pressure. Elymus lanceolatus shows potential to be used for restoring grasslands. This can indirectly help human food consumption as E. lanceolatus may improve soil health.Wilson SD (2015) Managing contingency in semiarid grassland restoration through repeated planning. Restoration Ecology 23(4): 385 ‚Äì 392. Soil health may be improved because it produces a sod due to its ability to form grass root networks and rhizomes. The term sod refers to grass which is held together by roots below soil. Plants may have a more difficult time forming rhizomes if there are neighboring roots nearby that would cause physical resistance. This plant‚Äôs growth is increased by removing other plants nearby and planting at a moderate density around 300-600 seeds/m2. In a study, Tamarix (a new invader species found in the United States) was grown with Elymus lanceolatus to examine if plant growth was improved or hindered. With Tamarix, species including wheatgrass had a greater biomass. The exact mechanism of why this occurred is unknown.Lenhoff EA, Menalled FD (2013) Impacts of Tamarix-mediated soil changes on restoration plant growth. Applied Vegetation Science16(3): 438 ‚Äì 447. Wheatgrass has also previously been shown to be beneficial for forage uses. This may be because it can be seeded with legumes in both warm and cool seasonsBiligetu B, Jefferson PG, Muni R, Schellenberg MP (2014) Late summer forage yield, nutritive value, compatibility of warm- and cool-season grasses seeded with legumes in western Canada. Canadian Journal of Plant Science94(7): 1139 ‚Äì 1148.. Elymus lanceolatus has specifically been used for animal foraging. Though E. lanceolatus does not produce a nut or berry product, it can be consumed by grazing animals. In the spring, it is a preferred food source for elk, horses, and cattle. It is additionally beneficial because it has a rapid vegetative spread rate even though its rate of spreading seeds is slow. Humans have not eaten E. lanceolatus because studies suggest that it may inedible for human consumption. However, it has a medium protein nutritive potential. Its protein levels are highest in the spring, at around 20%. This protein content decreases to about 4% as the plant matures. The amount of carbohydrates that can be digested (in animals) are about 45% in the growth period of E. lanceolatus. The USDA Plants Profile page suggests that E. lanceolatus is not palatable to humans. This grass makes a good forage for livestock, particularly when it is young and succulent. This grass may also be used for foraging in the summer season even though many other grass species are past their optimal nutritive and productive period. Wildlife such as elk also consume it. It is valuable for revegetation efforts in disturbed spaces such as pipeline construction sites and is good for rangeland rehabilitation. It is also used in urban areas. Its ability to form thick sod makes it good for erosion control, and the sod is so dense that many weeds are unable to invade stands of it. A number of cultivars have been introduced, such as 'Bannock,' 'Critana,' 'Elbee,' 'Schwendimar,' 'Secar,' and 'Sodar'. The grass, including its cultivars, has been shown to be effective at inhibiting the spread of weeds such as Russian knapweed (Acroptilon repens) and diffuse knapweed (Centaurea diffusa). This species can hybridize with some other wheatgrasses, such as bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata) and slender wheatgrass (Elymus trachycaulus). From an evolutionary biology standpoint, wheatgrass has adapted to environmental conditions over time. For example, streambank wheatgrass can grow in medium and heavily coarsed textured soil. Streambank wheatgrass is less coarse, less rhizomatous, and more tolerant to drought than western wheatgrass. There are cultivars of Elymus lanceolatus as well. For example, the Aberdeen Plant Materials Center developed a type of wheatgrass using E. lanceolatus known as Bannock. Overall, E. lanceolatus may be a species of interest to the agricultural community. References Further reading *Humphrey, L. D. and D. A. Pyke. (2001).

Joan Campbell was born in Geelong, Victoria in 1925. At the age of fifteen, in 1940, her family relocated to Western Australia.Joan Campbell, potter / edited by Luceille Hanley; with Rie Heymans, John McPhee and Ted Snell; photographs by Roger Garwood. Fremantle, W.A. : Fremantle Arts Centre Press, 1984. She took up pottery later in life, at first as just a hobby before pursuing it as a craft. She constructed a wood-fire kiln at her Scarborough home, teaching herself firing techniques. In 1959, Campbell worked with Johannes de Blanken, a Dutch potter who had moved to Western Australia. She then partnered with Eileen Keys and they resolved to use only locally available materials in their work. In 1966, the two experimented with the Raku firing techniques, which then became her preferred method of firing. Campbell held her first solo exhibition in 1969 at the Old Fire Station Gallery in Fremantle. In 1970 she travelled to the United States and worked with Paul Soldner. Campbell found herself being recognised as an exponent of Raku, and was invited in 1972 to exhibit at the International Academy of Ceramics Exhibition, with a selected group of Australian potters, at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. In 1968 Campbell helped establish the Western Australian Branch of the Crafts Association of Australia (later Craft Association of Western Australia) as the Association's secretary. She was a foundation member of the Crafts Board of the Australia Council (which was established in 1973), and was a member of the Australia Council from 1974 to 1977. Campbell established a studio at the Old Kerosene Store building on the shore of Bathers Beach, adjacent to the ruins of the original Fremantle Jetty (south of the South Mole of Fremantle Harbour) in 1975.

A state and national representative and prolific goal-kicker, he played his club football in Sydney mainly with Newtown, who have named him as one of their greatest ever players. A South Sydney junior player, Clifford started playing in the NSWRFL premiership for the Newtown club in 1951. He played at fullback for Newtown in their loss to Souths in the 1954 NSWRFL season's grand final, kicking six goals. In the grand final of the 1955 NSWRFL season the same two sides again faced each other. Clifford missed a 79th minute field goal attempt and Souths were again victorious. In 1956 Clifford was first selected to represent Australia in the 2nd Test against New Zealand, becoming Kangaroo No. 324. He was selected on the 1956‚Äì57 Kangaroo Tour and after the great Clive Churchill was injured in the 1st Test, Clifford took over as Australia's fullback playing in four Test matches and ten tour games and topping the tour points-scoring tally list with 94 points (2 tries, 44 goals). He made his first state appearance for New South Wales in 1957 and the following year with Churchill in his career twilight, Clifford displaced \\"the Little Master\\" in the domestic three Test series against the visiting British tourists. These would be Clifford's last representative appearances. He joined Eastern Suburbs for one season in 1960, and then retired from the sport.

Before 1994, the bank was known as the Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank or BFTB. UniCredit Bulbank was formed in 2007 as a merger between Bulbank, Biochim, and Hebros Bank, all of them owned by the UniCredit Group. History Bulbank's prototype, the Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank, started in 1964 as a fully state-owned bank, with a paid-up capital of BGL 40 million and statutory specialisation in foreign trade payments and finance. Representative offices of the Bank in London, Frankfurt, and Vienna were opened during the next two decades. BFTB took part of the establishment of two joint stock companies in 1987 and 1998 ‚Äî Bayerisch-Bulgarische Handelsbank GmbH (after 1998, HypoVereinsbank Bulgaria) with Bayerische Vereinsbank (HVB) and Bulgarsovinvest (after 1994, Corporate Commercial Bank) with Vnesheconombank, respectively. In 1991, after the 1989 coup, the Bank Consolidation Company (BCC) was founded as a holding company to consolidate the state ownership in the banking sector and to facilitate the privatisation of banks. BCC held 98% of Bulbank's share capital. Bulbank was the first Bulgarian bank to adopt SWIFT codes, whereby it significantly strengthened its operational performance and enhanced the reliability of its transactions. The 1992 meeting of shareholders changed the bank's status to a universal commercial bank, so the branch network was expanded (Plovdiv, Kardzhali, Burgas, Stara Zagora, etc.), focusing on customer service in the years to follow. In 1994, the meeting of shareholders passed a resolution to change the bank's name to Bulbank. In 1998 Bulbank co-branded its international card payment system with Visa International and Europay International. As a result of the privatisation procedure between 1998 and 2000 UniCredito Italiano possessed of 93% of the capital and Allianz had 5%. Bulbank sold its participations in Corporate Commercial Bank (99,9%), as well as that in United Bulgarian Bank (35%) and in HypoVereinsbank Bulgaria (49%). In 2001 Bulbank's major shareholder, UniCredito, sold minor stakes to the Italian SIMEST S.p.A., Rome, and the International Finance Corporation ‚Äî 2,5% and 5,3% of the share capital respectively. Since 2006, Bulbank has been in the process of merging with HVB Bank Biochim and Hebros Bank, after UniCredit Group's merger with HVB Group in 2005. On April 27 2007 the legal merger between Bulbank, HVB Bank Biochim and Hebros Bank was announced. The name of the merged institution is UniCredit Bulbank . Since 2001, the CEO of UniCredit Bulbank is Levon Hampartzoumian.

Qaramalik is surrounded by Aji Chay river from north, Ravasan and Tabriz railway station in south and Hokmavar and Sham Qazan in east. Qaramalik used to be a village near Tabriz, however after the destruction of the walls of the city in late nineteenth century and then expansion of the city, it became part of Tabriz and is now a part of district 6 of Tabriz municipality. During 1960s and 1970s Qaramalik changed rapidly from a village with agriculture economy into an industrial region, when Tabriz Mashin Sazi factory was established in the farm lands of the village. Later several other factories were founded in Qaramalik, such as Idem, Pumpiran. A poly-technique college was found later as well. Behruz Heschmat's Work and Thought sculpture, located in Qaramalik, is one of the symbols of modern Qaramalik. Unsustainable industrialization affected the village not only by adding a modern face to the still rural neighbourhood, but also by destroying most of the gardens and villages as well. Only a few farms have survived the land use change and the neighoubourhood suffers from the environmental effects of the factories. Qaramalik has an old main square, called Hoseiniyeh square. Qaramalik has ten mosques, among which the Friday mosque (Azerbaijani: B√ºy√ºk M…ôscid) is the most important one, which is located in Hoseiniyeh square. Also one cemetery-out of several historic cemeteries-of Qaramalik has survived. Qaramalik's role during Iranian Constitutional Revolution is a controversial topic. Some believe that Qaramalik was supporting grand ayatollah Hasan Mojtahed Tabrizi. Also it has been mentioned that Qaramalik was Mohammad Ali Shah forces' attack point against revolutionaries in Tabriz.

It is the only island in the lagoon on German territory. The first recorded mention of the island dates to the year 1252, when Duke Barnim I of Pomerania gifted this island along with other possessions to Eldena Abbey. It was then given it the Slavic name Wozstro.Klaus Conrad (Bearb.): Pommersches Urkundenbuch. Vol. 1. 2nd ed., B√∂hlau Verlag, Cologne and Vienna, 1970, No. 559. The present name of the island is derived from the village of Rieth on the southern shore of the bay. The island belongs to the district of Vorpommern-Greifswald in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and lies in the extreme northeast of Germany. It has national importance as a bird island. It is 0.79 km¬≤ in area and lies about a kilometre from the south and west shore of the Neuwarper See. The sea border with Poland runs immediately past the eastern tip of the island. Rare bird species such as the common tern and the snipe may be encountered here. White-tailed eagle, Montagu's harrier, marsh harrier, red kite, black kite, kestrel, hobby, honey buzzard and common buzzard are also found here.

Prompted by tensions along the Israeli‚ÄìSyrian border, Egypt deployed its armed forces on Israel's largely undefended southern front, catching Israel off guard. Although hostilities did not break out, the crisis influenced events leading up to the 1967 Six-Day War.  Background  Gamal Abdel-Nasser and Shukri al-Quwatli signing the Syria-Egypt union pact, forming the United Arab Republic Following Israel's withdrawal from Sinai, captured during the 1956 Suez Crisis, the peninsula remained de facto demilitarized of most Egyptian forces. It was garrisoned by one infantry brigade, elements of several reconnaissance regiments and up to 100 tanks. Although the outcome of the Suez Crisis had been politically positive for Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, Israel's Military Intelligence Directorate (Aman), as well as military and civilian decision makers, had regarded Israel's military victory in the war as an effective deterrent to future Egyptian designs. In early 1960, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, therefore, estimated that Egypt would seek \\"to avoid a military confrontation with Israel and keep the United Nations Emergency Force\\" (UNEF) installed in the Gaza Strip following the crisis. Unlike Israel's southern border, however, its northern border with Syria was prone to further conflicts, rooted in disputes over the nature and boundaries of Israel's demilitarized zones. These tensions along the border became more complicated in February 1958 with the establishment of the UAR, a short-lived political union of Egypt and Syria. Escalations on the northern border were, henceforth, likely to trigger a response on the relatively quiet front in the south.  Crisis   Tawafiq Raid  In late 1959 tensions along the northern border escalated once more over Israeli cultivation rights in the southern DMZ, on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. The Syrians eventually started shelling Israeli military positions with heavy mortars and, on January 31, 1960, an Israeli policeman was killed and two others were wounded. That same night, Israel's Golani Brigade carried out Operation Hargol (cricket), raiding Syrian positions in the village of al-Tawafiq. Nine Syrians were killed and 15 injured, while Israel suffered three fatalities and 17 wounded. In response, the Syrian military raised its state of alert, mobilized two reserve brigades and moved an artillery regiment and tank company closer to the border. Arab media portrayed the Tawafiq raid as an Israeli defeat, carrying reports of heavy Israel Defense Forces (IDF) losses. It also did not make any secret of the heightened state of alert in both Egypt and Syria. In Al-Ahram on February 1, Mohamed Hassanein Heikal, friend and adviser to President Gamal Abdel Nasser, wrote that Egypt had declared a state of emergency and moved its forces to the border, where \\"The two armies constitute an effective pincer against Israel.\\" Israel's military intelligence, however, found no evidence for such moves, and attributed the increased state of alert in both Egypt and Syria to fears of further Israeli attacks. Arab leaders appear to have genuinely believed Israel was preparing for an offensive. On February 8, Nasser went as far as to declare that the UAR was expecting an Israeli attack \\"any minute.\\" While Israel did bolster its forces following the Syrian moves, it had made no plans to initiate hostilities and was, rather, acting to de-escalate tensions in the north.  Egyptian mobilization  As neither side actually sought confrontation, tensions appeared to subside towards the second week of February. Israeli forces were recalled from the north. On February 12, however, two Israeli soldiers on patrol were killed by Syrian fire near Lake Hula. Although Israel responded with stern warnings, both sides initially remained calm. Yet beginning on February 15 and 16, the UAR began receiving intelligence of Israeli preparations for an attack on Syria. These included news of large IDF concentrations in the Galilee, mobilization of reserve formations, the closing off of Haifa Port for military shipments, the recall of pilots and officers from abroad, and sharp debates between Israel's leaders. Most of this intelligence, probably supplied by the Soviet Union, was untrue, yet the leadership of the UAR was convinced of an impending Israeli attack, probably scheduled for February 22. Nasser had apparently come to believe that the state of alert publicly declared after the Tawafiq incident had succeeded in deterring Israel from attacking Syria. Now that Israel was allegedly deploying its forces again, Nasser (probably on February 16) ordered the Egyptian army into the Sinai. Advanced detachments of the Egyptian army began crossing the Suez Canal on February 17 and between February 22 and 24 both the 2nd Infantry Division and 4th Armored Division moved into Sinai in radio silence. By February 27, 6 out of Egypt's 10 infantry brigades and all three Egyptian armoured brigades were in place. UAR forces on the Syrian front comprised seven additional brigades. Aman had gotten wind of the Egyptian decision to mobilize soon after it was taken, yet political fears of exasperating the already tense situation along the border delayed much needed reconnaissance flights. Only on February 23, after an American tip-off, did an Israeli Air Force (IAF) Sud-Ouest Vautour photograph the Suez Canal zone to bring back news that the 4th Armored Division had in fact left its garrison. A second flight over the Sinai a day later revealed the full extent of the Egyptian deployment. Egyptian forces had deployed both close to the border and in depth, and Israel's forces in the Negev, consisting of between 20 and 30 tanks, were now facing 500 Egyptian tanks and SU-100 tank destroyers. Sud-Ouest Vautour IIB 33 \\"Big Brother\\" at the Israeli Air Force Museum. This aircraft conducted both IAF reconnaissance flights on February 23 and 24.  Israeli response  On February 25 IDF Chief of Operations Yitzhak Rabin sent Ezer Weizman, commander in chief of the IAF, a note saying: \\"We've been caught with our pants down. During the next twenty four hours everything depends on the air force.\\" Israel had been caught off guard and the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces now issued a set of orders, codenamed \\"Rotem,\\" for an emergency movement of forces. Israel's plans for the defense of the south had called for the deployment of four brigades. Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion refused the IDF's request for a massive mobilization of reserves, but authorized the call-up of 7,000 men, the minimum required to maintain a heightened state-of-alert for a prolonged amount of time. Thus the units deployed in the next 24 hours were mostly regular army units. The 1st Golani Brigade and the 7th Armored Brigade deployed to the northern Negev, near the Rafah Opening, while the 35th Paratroopers Brigade and 37th Mechanized Brigade held the Ketziot region. As these moved into position, the air force was instructed to prepare for immediate action against Egyptian forces in the Sinai. Beyond the immediate danger of an Egyptian attack on its inadequate defenses, however, Israel also faced two additional threats. First, the massing of forces along both sides of the border could, even inadvertently, deteriorate into open warfare. Furthermore, a massive Egyptian presence on the border would force Israel to maintain its forces, mostly reserve troops, in the south for an indeterminate amount of time, a drain on national resources. These could also have repercussions on other points of conflict, such as Israeli shipping in the Red Sea. Ben-Gurion had refused a massive call-up of reservists in order to keep a low profile and prevent actions that might be deemed provocative, and also refused to allow additional reconnaissance flights over the Sinai. Censorship prevented the media from reporting the heightened state-of-alert, and Ben-Gurion met with newspaper editors to brief them on what they should not report.  United Nations role  Israel turned to the diplomatic front. In overtures to the United States and the United Nations it stressed both the increased Arab military presence on its borders and the faulty Arab intelligence regarding its intentions towards Syria. UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld was asked to intervene with Cairo, but told Israeli diplomats he did not consider the situation dire enough to take action, and that a dramatic change in his plans would only serve to exacerbate tensions. This response enraged Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir. On February 25, she asked Israel's representative at the UN, Yosef Tekoah, to speak to Hammarskjold again, regarding rumored Egyptian deployment in the Gaza Strip and the possible evacuation of the UN Emergency Force. Israeli officials were also upset that UN military personnel did not inform Israel of significant Egyptian military moves in the Gaza region, despite the previous practice of doing so. Hammarskjold would only suggest a visit to the region \\"in the near future,\\" or a meeting with Ben-Gurion during his upcoming visit the US. He pointed out that Egypt had informed the UN of the February 23 reconnaissance flight yet had not filed an official complaint, an indication of its own reluctance to escalate the crisis. It is unclear whether Hammarskjold had ever contacted Cairo regarding Israeli concerns, and Ben- Gurion soon concluded Hammarskjold could not be counted on for assistance.  De-escalation  Just as Egyptian forces were completing their deployment, Aman begun picking up indications of a decrease in Egypt's military state of alert. On February 27, Egyptian Air Force exercises resumed, and more such indications arrived in subsequent days. In light of this, Ben-Gurion and IDF Chief-of-Staff Haim Laskov authorized the demobilization of 6,000‚Äì7,000 Israeli troops, and the 7th and 35th brigades returned to routine standing. Although Egyptian forces were still fully deployed, all but 400 Israeli reservists had been discharged by March 5. On March 9, Egyptian forces also started to withdraw, starting with the 2nd division and followed in the second half of the month by the 4th. An editorial in Al-Ahram on the same day described the crisis from the Egyptian perspective: an Egyptian deployment had prevented Israel from attacking Syria, prompting the Israeli cabinet to act diplomatically rather than militarily. The Egyptian media, mostly silent on the affair since February 24, described the outcome as a brilliant victory for the Egyptian army.  Aftermath  Chief of the IDF General Staff at the time of the Rotem Crisis, Rav Aluf Haim Laskov Although neglected in the historiography of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, the Rotem Crisis was the most serious challenge to Israel's doctrine of deterrence in the years between the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War. Haim Laskov described it as the most dramatic event of his tenure. It revealed deficiencies in the Israeli intelligence community, which failed to provide warning of an imminent threat, and in the IDF's ability to translate such warnings into immediate action. Although intelligence had suggested Egyptian forces were on the move, a week went by before the full extent of the Egyptian deployment came to light and countermeasures were taken. Rabin, a future Chief-of-Staff, later wrote that Israeli intelligence had never been in worse shape. Laskov had lost all faith in the head of military intelligence, Chaim Herzog, but was prevented from dismissing him by Ben-Gurion. The crisis influenced Israeli national security policy, defining any Egyptian military build-up along its border as unacceptable, while the Israeli intelligence community took extensive measures to improve its collection capabilities. The crisis has come to be regarded as a \\"trial run\\" for the events that led to the 1967 Six-Day War. Israel and Egypt had drawn very different conclusions from the crisis. While the former came to believe new and restrictive rules had been set in place, the latter believed that it had gained more room to maneuver, able to deter Israel by the deployment of forces without the actual necessity of going to war. When, in 1967, Nasser once again moved the Egyptian army into the Sinai following renewed reports of tension along the Israeli-Syrian border, many in the IDF General Staff were reminded of events in 1960. Both Rabin and Weizman, in their respective memoirs, noted that events in 1967 at first seemed like a repeat of the Rotem crisis, and that lessons drawn from the first were applied in the second. There was initially little thought of war. In 1992, retired Major-General Jamal Mat'lum, Director of the Egyptian Army's Center for Strategic Studies, also noted the role played by the Rotem Crisis in Egyptian decision making in 1967: Yet while the Egyptian deployment in 1960 had been discreet, in 1967 it was carried out in full view of the public. The new deployment evoked widespread enthusiasm in the Arab world, leaving the various players with less room to maneuver. Nasser demanded the withdrawal of UNEF and the crisis soon gathered a momentum of its own, eventually leading to war.

This policy continued after the Second World War, and increased with annual purchases of the Permanente company and exhibitions of religious art at the Angelicum. Since the late 1960s, it began to make purchases at sales held by auction houses. The works of Istituto Bancario Italiano were added to its collection. It includes a portrait gallery of former Cariplo presidents. After the passage of the Amato Law donations increased, including the (Manara Grolle, Marcenaro legacy). Completing the collection of presidential portraits at the Cariplo, are paintings and sculptures of the nineteenth and twentieth century depicting many of the protagonists of the modern Italian economy. The collection was inherited the aftermath of the Amato Law, the Cariplo Foundation increased as a result of subsequent donations (legacy Manara, Grolla, Marcenaro).

Life Boudon was born in La F√®re in Picardy to Jean and Antoinette Jourdin Boudon. His father was lieutenant of the citadel. After 15 years of childless marriage his mother prayed for a child, which prayers became only more intense with the death of their first born shortly after birth. The town of Liesse-Notre-Dame is situated about northwest of Reims. Liesse-Notre-Dame (Our Lady of Joy) is a center of Marian pilgrimage, and was a favorite shrine of Princess Henrietta Maria of France.Wedgwood, C. V. (1970) The King's War: 1641‚Äì1647. London: Fontana On her way to Liesse, in company with her mother, Marie de' Medici, and sister-in-law, Anne of Austria, she happened to pass through La F√®re on the day of the infant Boudon's christening. The princess agreed to be the child's godmother and he was baptized Henri-Marie. Not long after his christening, his parents made a pilgrimage to Liesse, where his mother dedicated the child to Mary, Queen of Angels and invoked her protection of him. His father died shortly thereafter, and his mother soon remarried. At the age of eleven Henri-Marie was sent to attend the Jesuit college at Rouen. Later he studied at the Sorbonne.

His criticism was not well-received and made many enemies, as did his efforts to reform a disinterested and self- indulgent clergy. Boudon was a key figure in the French school of spirituality. A recurring theme in Boudon's work, characteristic of the French school, was the idea that the search for God requires detachment from all creatures. \\"God Alone\\"The life of Henri-Marie Boudon, (Edward Healy Thompson, ed.)

Above is a round drum surrounded by a rotunda of Ionic columns, capped by a dome. The ground floor was originally open and contained an arcade housing a market for grain and butter. The openings to the arcade were later filled with the current ground-floor windows. The building has served a number of purposes over the years; as well as housing Lancaster's Council Chamber and subsequently the City Museum, it also housed the town court (complete with lock-ups) and branches of Barclays Bank (until 1969) and the National Westminster Bank (until 1977). Collections The museum was founded in 1923, and its collections illustrate the archaeology and history of the city and surrounding areas. Among its highlights is the Lancaster Roman Tombstone, a memorial dating from c. 100 AD which was found locally in 2005. It depicts a Roman soldier on horseback with a decapitated opponent at his feet, and is described as \\"an iconic piece of Lancaster's dramatic past [giving] a crucial insight into the history of the county.\\" The museum has expressed an interest in acquiring the Viking-era Silverdale Hoard, discovered in the City of Lancaster district in 2011, for its collection. The collections also include the King's Own Royal Regiment Museum. The Museums, Libraries and Archives Council granted the museum \\"Accredited\\" status; since 1 October 2011 accreditation is a responsibility of Arts Council England.

It can be divided into two types, zooming in and zooming out.  Zooming in  When zooming in, the storytellers guides the reader to follow his/her point of view. At the start, it is usually an aerial shot of the fictional world, giving a bird's eye view of the place. The writer then delimits the reader's scope and finally leads the reader to the object of focus, or the focalized object. Since the introduction of the object is suspended, the ending may be surprising. It is known as a surprise ending.  Zooming out  When zooming out, an object is focused first. Then, the writer widens the view of the reader and eventually introduces the overview of the fictional world. It can give the reader a general idea of the place.

The series is based on Piper Kerman's memoir, Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison (2010), about her experiences at FCI Danbury, a minimum- security federal prison. Produced by Tilted Productions in association with Lionsgate Television, Orange Is the New Black premiered on Netflix on July 11, 2013. In February 2016, the series was renewed for a fifth, sixth, and seventh season. Its seventh and final season was released on July 26, 2019. Orange Is the New Black is Netflix's most-watched original series. It was widely acclaimed throughout its run, and has received many accolades. For its first season, the series garnered 12 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, and Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series, winning three. A new Emmy rule in 2015 forced the series to change categories from comedy to drama. For its second season, the series received four Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series, and Uzo Aduba won for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. Orange Is the New Black is the first series to score Emmy nominations in both comedy and drama categories. The series has also received six Golden Globe Award nominations, six Writers Guild of America Award nominations, a Producers Guild of America Award, an American Film Institute award, and a Peabody Award. Plot The series begins revolving around Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), a woman in her thirties living in New York City who is sentenced to 15 months in Litchfield Penitentiary, a minimum-security women's federal prison in upstate New York. Chapman was convicted of transporting a suitcase full of drug money for her girlfriend Alex Vause (Laura Prepon), an international drug smuggler. The offense had occurred 10 years before the start of the series and in that time Chapman had moved on to a quiet, law-abiding life among New York's upper middle class. Her sudden and unexpected indictment disrupts her relationships with her fianc√©, family and friends. In prison, Chapman is reunited with Vause (who named Chapman in her trial, resulting in Chapman's arrest), and they re-examine their relationship. Simultaneously, Chapman, along with the other inmates, attempt to grapple with prison's numerous, inherent struggles. Episodes often feature flashbacks of significant events from various inmates' and prison guards' pasts. These flashbacks typically depict how an inmate came to be in prison or develop a character's backstory. The prison is initially operated by the \\"Federal Department of Corrections\\" (a fictional version of the Federal Bureau of Prisons), and was in a later season acquired by the Management & Correction Corporation (MCC), a private prison company. The fifth season shows the prisoners revolting against the guards, wardens and the system after MCC's failed handling of an inmate's death at the hands of a guard in the fourth season. The inmate death had followed a peaceful protest and subsequent instigation of an inmate fight by another guard. Fueled by the conditions the inmates are forced to tolerate, as well as grudges against the prison guards, a three-day riot ensues. During the riot, some inmates attempt to negotiate better living conditions and seek justice for the death of the inmate, while others pursue their own interests and entertainment, and a few seek no involvement. At the emergence of the riot, the guard who incited the fight in the prior season is critically wounded by an inmate who took the gun the guard illegally brought into the prison. At the end of the season, SWAT raids the prison to end the riot and remove all inmates from the facility. During this raid, a correctional officer is fatally wounded by a corrupt \\"strike team\\", which then conspires to blame the guard's death on inmates who hid in an underground bunker and had taken the guard hostage. All inmates are transported to other prisons. The consequences of the riot are shown in the sixth season. A number of the inmates, including Chapman and Vause, are transported to Litchfield Maximum Security. Most of these inmates are interrogated, and several of them charged and sentenced for their involvement in the riot. In max, new inmates are introduced, alliances are made, and a gang-like war emerges between two prison blocks, spearheaded by a longstanding feud between two sisters and a grudge harbored by them toward a former maximum-security inmate who returned as a consequence of the riot (she had been moved to the minimum security prison). Inmates who arrived from the minimum security prison are either caught up or willingly participate in the war between prison blocks. The season portrays further corruption and guard brutality. The seventh season provides an ending to various inmate's stories. Chapman and Vause continue their on/off again relationship. The season shows how some prisoners are able to move beyond their time in prison while others are captured by the system and through their own flaws and/or systemic problems in the structure of US society and its justice system are unable to progress. In addition to the established setting of Litchfield Max, a significant portion of the season takes place in a newly created ICE detention center for detained presumed illegal immigrants, showing their struggles and lack of access to outside help in large part because of complete or extreme disregard of the law. Throughout the series, it is shown how various forms of corruption, funding cuts by the corporate owner to increase profit by millions, privatization of prison, overcrowding, guard brutality and racial discrimination (among other issues), affect the prisoners' safety, health and well-being; the correctional officers‚Äô lives; and the prison's basic inability to fulfill its fundamental legal responsibilities and ethical obligations as a corrections institution. One of the show's key conflicts involves the minimum- security prison's Director of Human Activities (aka the warden, under privatization nomenclature), Joe Caputo, whose efforts and aims as a warden constantly conflict with the corporate interests of MCC, which acquired the facility when it was about to be shut down. This theme is continued when a new forward-thinking & caring warden is hired at the maximum security prison, and unlike Caputo actually institutes educational programs and positive changes. She is fired for these actions and her attitude toward the corporate corruption, although her short-lived changes have profound positive results.

She then set up a meeting with Kerman to pitch her on a TV adaptation, which she notes she \\"screwed up\\" as she spent most of the time asking Kerman about her experiences she described in the book rather than selling her on the show. This appealed to Kerman as it let her know that she was a fan and she signed off on the adaptation. Kohan would later go on to describe the main character, Piper Chapman, as a \\"trojan horse\\" for the series, allowing it to focus on characters whose demographics would not normally be represented on TV. In July 2011, it was revealed that Netflix was in negotiations with Lionsgate for a 13-episode TV adaptation of Kerman's memoirs with Kohan as creator. In November 2011, negotiations were finalized and the series had been greenlit. Kohan had initially wanted to cast Katie Holmes in the role of Piper Chapman, and met with the actress to discuss it, but Holmes had other commitments. Casting announcements began in August 2012 with Taylor Schilling, the first to be cast, as Piper Chapman, followed by Jason Biggs as Piper's fianc√© Larry Bloom. Laura Prepon and Yael Stone were next to join the series, as Alex Vause and Lorna Morello, respectively. Abigail Savage, who plays Gina, and Alysia Reiner, who plays Fig, had auditioned for role of Alex Vause. Prepon initially auditioned for Piper Chapman, however Kohan felt she would not worry about her [in prison], noting a \\"toughness and a presence to her that wasn't right for the character.\\" Kohan instead gave her the role of Alex. Stone had originally auditioned for the role of Nicky Nichols, but she was not considered \\"tough enough\\" for the character; she was asked to audition for Lorna Morello instead. Likability was important for Morello, whom casting director Jen Euston deemed \\"a very helpful, nice, sweet Italian girl.\\" Natasha Lyonne was to audition for Alex, but was asked to read for the character Nicky Nichols; \\"[Kohan knew] she could do Nicky with her eyes closed. She was perfect,\\" said Euston. Laverne Cox, a black transgender woman, was cast as Sophia Burset, a transgender character. The Advocate touted Orange Is the New Black as possibly the first women-in-prison narrative to cast a transgender woman for this type of role. Uzo Aduba read for the part of Janae Watson but was offered the character Suzanne \\"Crazy Eyes\\" Warren. Taryn Manning was offered the role of Tiffany \\"Pennsatucky\\" Doggett. This American Life host Ira Glass was offered a role as a public radio host, but he declined. The role instead went to Robert Stanton, who plays the fictional host Maury Kind. Orange is the New Black is set in a fictional minimum-security prison in Litchfield, New York, which is a real town in upstate New York, but it does not have a federal penitentiary. The series began filming in the former Rockland Children's Psychiatric Center in Rockland County, New York, on March 7, 2013. The building, part of the what was then the Rockland State Hospital campus, was completed in 1970 and closed by 2010. The title sequence features photos of real former female prisoners including Kerman herself, she is the one that blinks. On June 27, 2013, prior to the series' premiere, Netflix renewed the show for a second season consisting of 13 episodes. For the second season, Uzo Aduba, Taryn Manning, Danielle Brooks, and Natasha Lyonne were promoted to series regulars. Laura Prepon did not return as a series regular for a second season because of scheduling conflicts, but returned for season 3 as a regular. On May 5, 2014, the series was renewed for a third season, as revealed by actress Laura Prepon. For the third season, several actors were promoted to series regulars, including Selenis Leyva, Adrienne C. Moore, Dascha Polanco, Nick Sandow, Yael Stone, and Samira Wiley. Both Jason Biggs and Pablo Schreiber were confirmed as not returning for the third season, but Schreiber appeared in the 10th episode of the third season. The series was renewed for a fourth season on April 15, 2015, prior to its third-season release. For the fourth season, Jackie Cruz and Lea DeLaria were promoted to series regulars; with Elizabeth Rodriguez also being promoted by the season's sixth episode. On February 5, 2016, the series was renewed for a fifth, sixth and seventh season. In season six, Dale Soules, Laura G√≥mez, and Matt Peters were promoted to series regulars. On October 17, 2018, Netflix announced that the seventh season would be the series' last and would be released on July 26, 2019.

The first season began airing on broadcast television in the UK on Sony Channel from April 19, 2017. It has been shown in Ireland on TG4 since January 15, 2018. In April 2017, it was reported that a cybercriminal had stolen the first ten episodes of season 5, in a security breach of a post-production company. Netflix failed to respond to ransom demands, and the cybercriminal leaked the episodes online. Netflix confirmed the security breach and an ongoing investigation by federal law enforcement. Multichannel News reported that demand for the series significantly increased over the seven-day period following the leak of the episodes. It was also said that the leak would likely cause a decrease in demand for the fifth season when Netflix released it in June 2017. Ratings Orange Is the New Black generated more viewers and hours viewed in its first week than the other top Netflix original series House of Cards and Arrested Development. In October 2013, Netflix stated that the show is a \\"tremendous success\\" for the streaming platform. \\"It will end the year as our most watched original series ever and, as with each of our other previously launched originals, enjoys an audience comparable with successful shows on cable and broadcast TV.\\" As reported in February 2016, Orange Is the New Black remained Netflix's most-watched original series. In 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that Orange Is the New Black is one of the shows most watched in urban areas, and despite its \\"minority-rich ensemble cast\\", the series \\"appeals more to a white audience\\".

Naval life He was the tenth son of George Malcolm of Burnfoot, youngest brother of Sir Pulteney Malcolm and Sir John Malcolm, and was born at Burnfoot in Dumfriesshire on 5 September 1782. In 1791 his name was put on the books of the Vengeance, commanded by his uncle, Thomas Pasley, and in 1793 of the Penelope, of which his brother Pulteney was first lieutenant. He entered the Navy in 1795 on board the Fox, then commissioned by his brother, with whom he went out to the East Indies, and whom he followed to the Suffolk. He was promoted by the admiral to be lieutenant on that ship, 12 January 1799, and remained in her till 3 October 1801, when he was appointed acting commander of the Albatross sloop, a promotion which was confirmed by the admiralty to 28 May 1802. In 1803, Malcolm came home acting captain of the Eurydice, and on his arrival in England found that he had been previously promoted by the admiralty on 29 December 1802. In 1804 he commanded the Raisonnable in the North Sea; and from 1806 to 1809 the Narcissus frigate, actively employed on the coast of France and Portugal; at Oporto in 1807 he was able to preserve British property from falling into the hands of the French. At the beginning of 1809, Malcolm went out to the West Indies, and in April took part in the capture of the Saintes islands. On his return to England he was moved into the Rhin, in which during 1812 and 1813, he was employed in co-operating with the patriots on the north coast of Spain. In 1813, he went out to the West Indies with convoy; in 1814, he was cruising on the coast of Brazil; and on 18 July 1815, having been joined by the frigates Menelaus and Havannah, sloops Fly and Ferret, and schooner , he landed a party of seamen and marines at Corrijou (Kor√©jou, east of Abervrach on the coast of Brittany), stormed the battery, and brought out of the harbour three small armed vessels and a convoy under their protection. The action was the last of its kind during that war. In September 1817, he fitted out the Sibylle, as flag-captain to Sir Home Popham in the West Indies, from which station he invalided in February 1819. From 1822 to 1827 he commanded one or other of the yachts, William and Mary and Royal Charlotte, in attendance on Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, lord-lieutenant of Ireland, by whom he was knighted. In November 1827, he was appointed superintendent of the Bombay Marine, then reorganised and placed under new regulations, which required it to have a captain of the Royal Navy at its head: Malcolm arrived at Bombay in June 1828. On 1 May 1830 its name was officially changed to \\"His Majesty's Indian Navy\\"; it undertook police duties, and ran a school of surveyors. Malcolm held the post for ten years. The establishment of steam navigation in the Red Sea was also largely due to his exertions. Malcolm was promoted to be rear-admiral on 10 January 1837, and to be vice-admiral on 28 April 1847, but had no further service. Later life During his later years he gave attention to the organisation of charitable institutions. He also served on the council of the Royal Geographical Society. He died at Brighton 4 June 1851, and was buried there. Family Malcolm was twice married: first, in 1808, to his cousin Magdalene, daughter of Charles Pasley, his mother's brother; and secondly, in 1829, to Elmira Riddell, youngest daughter of Major-general Shaw.

The jacking gear rotates the shaft or rotor and associated machinery (such as reduction gears and main turbines), to ensure uniform cool-down. Without turning, hogging or sagging can occur. Additionally, the jacking gear's assistance in rotation can be used when inspecting the shaft, reduction gears, bearings, and turbines. As an auxiliary function, the jacking gear also helps to maintain a protective oil membrane at all shaft journal bearings. Hogging is when the shaft bows upwards due to thermal stratification. On the engine shaft of a marine vessel, this process also prevents the shaft from warping when a ship is preparing to achieve maneuvering status. Motor and drivetrain The jacking gear motor is designed to rotate the shaft at approximately 1/10rpm. Most jacking gear motors are rated at 5hp. The jacking gear motor assembly applies power and torque to the reduction gear by a flexible coupling or clutch that can freely engage and disengage to the high-pressure pinion (driving gear). Engaging is accomplished by means of a simple lever. Some newer propulsion arrangements utilize an automatic control system located in the engine room.

Description Eragrostis curvula is usually a long-lived perennial grass, but it is sometimes an annual plant. It is variable in appearance, and there are many different natural and cultivated forms. In general, it forms tufts of stems up to tall. The tufts may reach a diameter of . The grass grows from a thick root network. Plants have been noted to have roots penetrating over deep in the soil and laterally. The roots can grow per day. The first root to grow into the soil from a seedling can send out up to 60 small rootlets per inch. The dense root system forms a sod. The drooping leaves of the grass are up to long but just a few millimeters wide, and they may have rolled edges. The inflorescence is a panicle with branches lined with centimeter-long spikelets. Each spikelet may contain up to 15 flowers. One panicle may produce 1000 seeds. Cultivated plants may produce two crops of seed per year. The plant self-fertilizes or undergoes apomixis, without fertilization. Uses This grass is valuable as a forage for livestock in Africa, its native range.Ncanana, S., et al. (2005).

There are many ecotypes. Several of these ecotypes were collected and introduced in the United States as cultivars. The grass was first planted in the United States in Stillwater, Oklahoma, in 1935. It was good for livestock, and its massive root network made it a good plant for erosion control. It spread quickly as it was planted for ornamental purposes. It reached New York in the 1960s and in the 1970s and 80s it was planted alongside many highways such as the Long Island Expressway. Today it occurs as an invasive species in wild habitat from the southwestern United States to the East Coast. It can be found in woodlands, chaparral, prairie, grassland, and disturbed areas. It is tolerant of very acidic and very basic soils; it grows easily in mine spoils.

The movement led to the introduction of the Sikh Gurdwara Bill in 1925, which placed all the historical Sikh shrines in India under the control of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). The Akalis also participated in the Indian independence movement against the British Government, and supported the non-cooperation movement against them. Formation Sikh leaders of the Singh Sabha in a general meeting in Lahore in March 1919 formed the Central Sikh League in March 1919, which was formally inaugurated in December of that year. In its periodical, the Akali, it listed among its objectives the goals of bringing back control of the Khalsa College, Amritsar under the control of representatives of the Sikh community (accomplished in November 1920 by negating government control through refusing government grants), liberating gurdwaras from mahant control, and encouraging Sikhs to participate in the independence movement, lending support to the non- cooperation movement in October 1920. The Central Sikh League demanded the administration of the Golden Temple to be transferred from the government to an elected representative body of Sikhs answerable to the panth, and in October 1919 took control of the Golden Temple and Akal Takht. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre in April 1919 during the course of the national independence movement, subsequent words of support from Arur Singh, the head priest of the Golden Temple, to General Dyer, and the general disturbances in Punjab in 1919 provoked an outcry among Singh Sabha circles, and increased Sikh urgency to reclaim control of the gurdwaras. To pacify these sentiments, the colonial Punjab Government appointed a provisional committee of 36 members, entirely from Sikh landed aristocrat families, to formulate proposals regarding the operation of the Golden Temple. Following the Central Sikh League's disapproval of the committee's composition, expressed in a large gathering at the Golden Temple on 16 November 1920 attended by over 10,000 Sikhs, the committee in charge of the Golden Temple was reformulated with 175 members to form a managing committee for all gurdwaras. The government, publicly pursuing a policy of neutral non-interference though still managing to have some appointees on the committee, allowed the new committee, and in December 1920 the committee was named the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, or SGPC, which coordinated the activities of Akali jathas, or volunteer groups, to liberate all gurdwaras from the corrupt mahants. The Akali movement was started in 1920 by the Central Sikh League's political wing, the Akali Dal, which was founded in Amritsar in December 1920 and assisted the SGPC. The term Akali derives from the word Akal (\\"timeless\\" or \\"immortal\\") used in the Sikh scriptures. The movement was named for the Akalis, a Khalsa militant order from the time of Guru Gobind Singh which had risen to prominence under Akali Phula Singh, one of the commanders of the Sikh Empire.  Initial agitations  By the early 20th century, a number of Sikh gurdwaras in British India were under the control of the Udasi mahants (clergymen) or managers appointed by the Governors. The Udasis had come to control Sikh shrines in the eighteenth century during the period of increased persecution of the Khalsa by the Mughal Empire during that time forced them to yield control of Sikh institutions to those without external identifiers; the Khalsa would subsequently focus on political power resulting in the Sikh Empire. The main aim of the Akali movement was to have the Sikh gurdwaras released from the control of the traditional clergy, which had become powerful and ritualized. The non-violent movement began in 1920, with the jathas, led by Kartar Singh Jhabbar, playing a major role. The first shrine chosen for reform was the Babe di Ber gurdwara in Sialkot. It was under the control of the widow of the mahant Harnam Singh. She initially resisted the takeover of the gurdwara by the Akalis, as it was her only source of income, but relented after she was offered a pension. The control of the gurdwara was then transferred to an elected committee headed by Baba Kharak Singh. The next major target of the Akalis was the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple), the holiest shrine of the Sikhs. The priest of the Golden Temple had refused to allow low-caste Hindu converts to offer prayers in the shrine. Kartar Singh Jhabbar walked to the Akal Takht in the temple premises, urging the Sikhs to give up the caste-based restrictions and reform the gurdwaras. On 28 June 1920, the Golden Temple came under the control of an elected committee called Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). Gurdwara Panja Sahib at Hasan Abdal Next, the Akalis headed to Hasan Abdal, where Gurdwara Panja Sahib was under the control of Mahant Mitha Singh. Singh allowed sale of cigarettes inside the gurdwara, and was disliked by the Sikhs. The Akalis led by Kartar Singh Jhabbar took control of the gurdwara on 20 November 1920. However, the local Hindus, who also frequented the gurdwara for worship, opposed this takeover. Around 5-6 thousand of them surrounded the gurdwara on the night of the Akali takeover, but were dispersed by the police. The next day, around 200-300 Hindu women squatted at the Gurdwara. Nevertheless, the gurdwara was later successfully brought under the authority of the SGPC. The Akalis then took control of the Gurdwara Sacha Sauda at Chuhar Kana (in present-day Pakistan). They then turned their attention to the Gurdwara Sri Tarn Taran Sahib, whose clergymen were accused of allowing dancing girls, smoking and drinking inside the shrine's premises. The clergymen were also accused of spreading the teachings of Arya Samaj, a Hindu reform movement some of whose leaders had criticized Sikhism. A group of 40 Akalis, led by Kartar Singh, arrived at the gurdwara on 25 January 1921, performed ardas (Sikh prayer) and declared that the gurdwara was now under their control. Henchmen employed by the mahants attacked the Akalis with crude bombs and bricks while the latter were sleeping. Two Akalis were killed and several wounded, and a jatha two weeks prior had also been beaten. The next day, the Sikhs from the surrounding villages took control of the Gurdwara, and a managing committee appointed by the SGPC. Following this, the Akalis led by Kartar Singh then took control of five more gurdwaras, including the Gurdwara Guru ka Bagh near Amritsar. The British, believing that gurdwara control could be contested in court, did not like the control of gurdwaras passing under the control of committees appointed by the SGPC.  Nankana massacre  Gurdwara Janam Asthan at Nankana Sahib In 1921, the Akalis turned their focus to the gurdwara at Nankana Sahib, the birthplace of the first Sikh Guru Nanak. The gurdwara was under the control of a mahant called Narain Das, who was accused of allowing immoral activities in the temple premises, including licentiousness and the misappropriation of gurdwara funds. One of the clergymen at the gurdwara had allegedly raped the 13-year-old daughter of a Hindu devotee from Sindh. The mahant's conduct had been widely condemned by the local congregation, though the large revenue from the gurdwara estates insulated him from public pressure. With the movement gaining momentum, public meetings passed resolutions condemning his conduct, and worried about being ousted by the Akalis, he turned to the government for help. When the government did respond, Narain Das made his own arrangements, preemptively fortifying the premises and hiring approximately 80 mercenaries. When a jatha of over 100 Sikh made an unscheduled trip to Nankana on 20 February 1921 without any intention yet of taking it, the Pashtun guards of the Mahant opened fire without warning, killing 130 people in what came to be known as the Nankana massacre. Visitors attempting to seek refuge in the gurdwara were chased and killed, and piles of dead and wounded were lit on fire to attempt to destroy evidence of the massacre. Reaction Two days later, Mahatma Gandhi and the Governor of the Punjab province visited the site, accompanied by a number of Sikh and Hindu leaders. Gandhi sympathized with the Sikhs and said that the Mahant had \\"out-Dyered Dyer.\\" The attending politicians utilized widespread anti-government feelings to exhort the Sikhs to join the national noncooperation movement, which was supported by a resolution passed by the SGPC in May 1921 appealing to Sikhs to begin civil disobedience. As the Sikh reformers were now aligned with the national movement, colonial administrators began to rethink its position on non-interference in gurdwara management and acceptance of the increasing control of the SGPC. Akalis headed to Nankana upon hearing the news in the thousands, and access to the gurdwara was restricted by the government, though eventually conceded. The British Government, finding itself under immense political pressure, agreed to transfer the control of the gurdwara to the Akalis on 3 March 1921. Narain Das and 26 of his henchmen were arrested. A section of Akalis rejected the peaceful methods adopted by SGPC, and formed the breakaway Babbar Akali movement to seize the control of the gurdwaras using violent methods. Some Akalis and Ghadarites would react against the killing of the Nankana massacre, attempting assassinations against officials held responsible for the killings, as well as their native supporters. Arrests of the militant leaders would follow, but the Babbar Akali Jatha, founded in August 1922 with the aim of defending the faith and political independence, would make overtures to ex- soldiers and the Akali reformers, as well as to Hindus and Muslims who opposed the authorities. They issued 15 issues of the Babbar Akali Doaba from a moving press throughout Jalandhar and Hoshiarpur from August 1922 to May 1923, and in 1923 committed a series of political assassinations; they were declared unlawful in August 1923 and in under a year most Babbar Akali leaders would be arrested or killed. Those arrested would be tried in 1925 and considered to be fighting for independence and Sikh rule, with six hangings in February 1926. Several organizations, including the Central Sikh League, would issued appeals to raise funds for the families of those killed and hanged, and they would be celebrated in poetry and literature.  Resistance movements  Amid the ongoing agitations, the SGPC urged the British Government to release the protestors and legalize its control of the gurdwaras. On 1 May 1921, the influential Sikh leaders passed a resolution for launching a passive resistance movement. The next day, a Sikh-Hindu conference was organized during the Punjab Congress Provincial Congress at Rawalpindi. The Jagat Guru Shankaracharya urged the Hindus to join the Sikhs in the struggle for taking control of the gurdwaras from mahants with personal interests. On 11 May, a number of Akali jathas were asked to proceed to designated gurdwaras to take over their control. Morcha Chabian (\\"Keys Campaign\\") In October 1921, the SGPC executive committee passed a resolution asking Sunder Singh Ramgharia, a mahant previously appointed by the government who subsequently assumed a position as an SGPC secretary, to relinquish the keys of the Golden Temple's toshakhana, or vault, to the committee, as he represented government control over the temple's treasures and artifacts. The government would take possession of the keys in November, when Sunder Singh would seek the advice of the Deputy Commissioner, who sent his subordinate Lala Amar Nath to take the keys. which prompted the SGPC to accuse the government of meddling in Sikh affairs, and appeal to Akali jathas to meet at Amritsar an organize protest meetings. The government would in response affix their own locks to the toshakhana in defiance, escalating the situation, and Akali protestors were arrested and given punishments. The conflict between the Sikhs and the government also lead to the consolidation of ties between the Akalis and noncooperation leaders, and the allegations of government interference in religious affairs began to affect the public opinion of Sikh soldiers, disbanded soldiers, and peasantry, on which colonial stability depended, and the threat of a major civil disobedience at the beginning of 1922. To prevent unrest, the government relented, handing over the toshakhana keys to the Baba Kharak Singh of the SGPC on 17 January 1922, and agreed to the unconditional release of all Sikhs arrested, the number of whom had been increasing up to that point. As Sikh concerns were now linked with the wider non-cooperation movement, Gandhi would telegraph the SGPC in January 1922 with \\"Congratulations, first decisive battle for India's freedom won.\\" The government's attitude toward the Akalis would grow more contentious by midyear however, as the Akalis would begin to consider independence as their best option. Guru-ka-Bagh The most notable conflict between the Akalis and the colonial government, highlighting the larger problem of private resource management of gurdwaras, occurred in August 1922 at the Guru-ka-Bagh (\\"garden of the guru\\") shrine 12 miles from Amritsar near Ajnala, built to mark a visit from Guru Arjan. The struggle between the Akalis and the mahant Sunder Das over the control of the site had resulted in the mahant keeping his position, though as part of a managing committee that would supervise him, similar to the toshakhana arrangement. However, in March 1921, the mahant reneged on the agreement, forcibly occupying the committee's office and destroying its records. A year later in August 1922, Akali volunteers chopped wood on land to fuel the fires of the gurdwara's free community kitchen, for which the mahant had them arrested for theft at the encouragement of the authorities, provoking a major struggle with the Akalis, who contended that the mahant could not claim private possession of the property, as it belonged to the Sikh panth, or congregation. The Akalis warned the government that denying Sikhs the right to gather fuel for the community kitchen was to deliberately undermine their faith, and the arrests drew more Akali volunteers to the site, with the SGPC launching a campaign to send non-violent Akali jathas to the gurdwara daily. Over 200 volunteers were arrested by August 25, and by October 19 over 2,450 would be arrested by authorities. As continuous waves of Akalis kept arriving, the authorities began to use violent methods, being declared an unlawful assembly, as bands of 50 to 100, and sometimes over 200, Akalis would take blows in non-violent resistance. On October 25, a jatha of retired soldiers reached the site, which was deemed by the government to be potentially destabilizing. National noncooperation leaders rallied to the cause by making speeches at the site, though support from Congress would wane after Gandhi's release in February 1924 as he wanted to separate the political issue of independence from religion. Christian missionary C.F. Andrews, visiting the site in September 1922, was shocked at the administration's brutality, describing Akali tactics as \\"a new lesson in moral warfare.\\" He protested to the Edward MacLagan, the Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab, and the conflict was settled by having the mahant sell the land to Sir Ganga Ram, a private Hindu philanthropist, who handed it over to the Akalis on 17 November 1922. Over 5,000 volunteers were released in March 1923. Gurdwara Bill The Government meanwhile launched a \\"Gurdwara Bill\\" to facilitate the settlement of the gurdwara disputes. The Bill provided setting up a Board of Commissioners for the management of the gurdwaras. However, the SGPC objected to the Government's right to appoint the Board members, and the bill was postponed. In On 17 November 1922, the \\"Sikh Gurdwaras and Shrines Bill\\" was introduced in the Punjab Legislative Assembly. All the Sikh and the Hindu members opposed the bill, but it was passed by 41 votes to 31 votes.  Jaitu and Bhai Pheru agitations  In 1923, the Akalis made plans to bring under their control Gurdwara Gangsar at Jaitu (or Jaito) in the Nabha State. The erstwhile Maharaja (ruler) of Nabha Ripudaman Singh had been sympathetic to the Akali and the Indian nationalist cause, but was deposed by the British Government, made to abdicate to his minor son on 9 July 1923. The SGPC held protest meetings, and on 4 August resolved to take up the cause, condemning the act in a meeting at Jaito on 25 August. When the SGPC launched an agitation, its leaders and members were arrested on the charge of sedition. Subsequently, several marches were organized in support of the agitation. The protesters were arrested, beaten and shot at by the police at various instances. With the disruption of a subsequent Akhand Path ceremony, the SGPC condemned the act and resolved to fight for the Sikh right of free worship, sending jathas from the Akal Takht to Jaito to complete the ceremony. The SGPC and Akali Dal were declared to be unlawful organizations on 12 October 1923, with the 60 members of the Jaito morcha committee arrested for treason against the Crown, though the members were replaced and the morcha continued. A jatha of 500 Akalis, seen off from Amritsar by a crowd of 30,000, was sent to mark the third anniversary of the Nankana massacre, and was fired upon by on the command of British administrators in Nabha, with about 300 injured, resulting in about 100 deaths. Jathas continued to Jaito until 101 akhand paths were completed on 6 August 1925, establishing the right to free worship. The Indian National Congress declared its support for the Akali agitation in at the special Congress Session in Delhi. The Akalis were then joined by several non- Sikhs, including Jawaharlal Nehru (later the first Prime Minister of India) and Kasturiranga Santhanam. Nehru and others were arrested during one such march. Finally, the Government of Punjab relented and agreed to transfer the control of the gurdwara to the Akalis. While the Jaitu agitation was on, the Akalis also sought the control of the gurdwara at Bhai Pheru. The gurdwara was controlled by Udasi mahants including Pala Ram, the brother of Narain Das (who was responsible for the Nankana massacre). The mahant agreed to transfer the control of the gurdwara to SGPC, after being offered a pension. However, in August 1923, when the Akalis decided to eject the Udasi tenants housed in the gurdwara premises, they faced considerable resistance. On 4 December 1923, a group of Akalis damaged a mahant's residence attached to the shrine. The police arrested 11 Akalis following a complaint. In December, the Government recognized the SGPC as the manager of the gurdwara, but also ordered the Akalis to follow the legal process for ejecting the Udasi mahants out of the premises. On 1 January 1924, an Akali jatha forcibly took the possession of the property occupied by Pala Ram. Around 34 Akalis were arrested by the police for this action on the next day. In subsequent days, a number of Akali jathas staged demonstrations at the site. A total of 5,251 persons were arrested for the demonstrations, and 3,092 of these were sent to the prison.  Sikh Gurdwara Bill  The British Government considered the Akali movement to be a greater threat than Mahatma Gandhi's civil disobedience movement. A 1921 memorandum signed by D. Petrie, the Assistant Director of CID, Punjab states: In 1925, after further demands and protests from SGPC, a new \\"Sikh Gurdwara Bill\\" was introduced in the Punjab Legislative Assembly on 7 May and adopted in July. It came into force on 1 November 1925, and awarded the control of all the historical shrines to SGPC. A tribunal was set up to judge the disputes, and all the Akali prisoners were released. By this time, an estimated 30,000 people had been arrested by the British Government; over 400 had been killed and another 2,000 had been injured during the movement. The movement fueled the anti-British Government feeling among the Sikhs. It also led to an anti-Hindu sentiment among a section of Sikhs, who identified the pro-Udasi mahants such as Narain Das and their supporters with the Hindu community. As the British authorities came to see the Akali movement to be a movement to overthrow the British and therefore to be suppressed, in addition to the casualties and arrests, there had been confiscation of properties and jagirs, fines, court-martials for wearing the kirpan, or Sikh dagger, and black turbans traditionally signalling revolt, and penalties against publishers, editors, and presses supportive of the movement. The movement found support from almost all sections of the Sikh community, especially the peasantry, artisans, laborers, ex-soldiers, and emigrants returning from abroad.

The regiment was raised in March 1915, and eventually assigned as the mounted regiment for the Australian Corps. During the war the regiment fought against the forces of the Ottoman Empire, at Gallipoli, and against the German Empire on the Western Front. For its role in the war the regiment was awarded twelve battle honours. In 1921, it was later re-raised as a part-time unit of the Citizens Forces, and was briefly amalgamated with the 19th Light Horse.

When the Australian infantry units had been dispatched to Gallipoli earlier that year, it was thought the terrain was unsuitable for mounted troops, and the light horse regiments had remained in Egypt. However, heavy casualties resulted in their deployment in May and the 13th Light Horse Regiment in turn was sent into battle in September 1915 in a dismounted role. The regiment was deployed defending the trenches at Lone Pine, a strongly contested stretch of the front line around Anzac Cove. Two months later in December, the regiment was withdrawn back to Egypt when the Allied forces were evacuated from the peninsula. Western Front Two squadrons - \\"B\\" and \\"D\\" - which had originally been part of the 4th Light Horse Regiment took part in the Battle of Messines, the Third Battle of Ypres, the Battle of Broodseinde, the Battle of Passchendaele, the Battle of the Lys, the Battle of Kemmel, the Second Battle of the Marne and the Battle of Tardenois. The two squadrons, together with a squadron from New Zealand, were eventually amalgamated and renamed the II Anzac Corps Mounted Regiment, and together earned nine battle honours on the Western Front. When the infantry component of the Australian Imperial Force was expanded to five divisions, the 13th Light Horse Regiment was broken up to provide a reconnaissance squadron for the 2nd, 4th, and 5th Divisions. The squadrons then moved to the Western Front in France between March and June 1916. They were soon reunited, however, as the \\"I ANZAC Mounted Regiment\\". The static nature of the fighting along the Western Front limited the use of mounted troops and they were mostly in a secondary role; doing traffic control, rear area security, escorting prisoners and during an attack reconnaissance and probing the German rear areas. The pinnacle of the regiment's service on the Western Front was following the Hundred Days Offensive when they led the advance of the Australian Corps. When the war ended the regiment was resting, and gradually its personnel were returned to Australia. Their total casualties during the war were 57 killed, and 328 wounded. Perpetuation In 1921, Australia's part-time military forces were re-organised to perpetuate the numerical designations of the AIF following its demobilisation. Through this process, the 13th Light Horse was re-raised as a Citizens Forces unit in Victoria, adopting the territorial designation of the \\"Gippsland Light Horse\\". In 1939, the regiment was amalgamated with the 19th Light Horse to become the 13th/19th Light Horse. In August 1940, during the opening stages of the Second World War, the 13th was re-formed in its own right. It was later mechanised and re-designated the \\"13th Motor Regiment\\" in March 1942, based at Gherang, Victoria. In May that year, it was converted into an armoured regiment ‚Äì designated as the \\"13th Armoured Regiment\\" ‚Äì as part of the 2nd Armoured Division's 6th Armoured Brigade, which had been formed for defensive duties to guard against a possible invasion of mainland Australia. After moving to Puckapunyal in July, the regiment was equipped with M3 Grant tanks. Further training was undertaken in Murgon, Queensland, throughout 1943. By that time, manpower within the Army was scarce and as the threat of an invasion by the Japanese diminished during the year, so too did the need for large-scale armoured forces. A number of armoured units were subsequently disbanded as men and equipment were reallocated as the Army reorganised for jungle warfare. As a result, the 13th was disbanded in October 1943. In the post war period, the unit was perpetuated by the 8th/13th Victorian Mounted Rifles, which existed between 1948 and 1991-92\\\\.

Edward Manville 1909 After a successful career as an electrical engineering consultant for local and foreign projects, Manville became chairman of Daimler Motor Company, later Daimler Company, from 1905 to 1933. He was also the chairman of several other companies, including the Baird Television Development Company throughout its existence from 1927 to 1928. He served as Member of Parliament for Coventry from 1918 to 1923. Early life Manville was born in Paddington, London 27 September 1862 to London surgeon dentist Benjamin Ephraim Manville (formerly Mosely) and Adeline Hyam, who were Jews.William D. Rubinstein, Michael Jolles, Hilary L. Rubinstein, The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History, Palgrave Macmillan (2011), p. 642 He was educated at University College School, London and technical institutions. Electrical engineering Early career and projects Memorial of first electric tram in Buenos Aires Manville had been attracted to the practical study of electricity at a time of invention and discovery. He obtained an apprenticeship with the well-known electrical firm of Woodhouse and Rawson where he met Madgen, with whom he first set up a practice as consulting electrical engineers. He later joined the Westminster firm of Kincaid and Waller, and was responsible for many important undertakings, including the tram system of Buenos Aires, considered a model of its kind. Association with Dudley Docker Manville, a pioneer British of electro-technology, was a partner in a Westminster electrical engineering consultancy which advised on the electrification of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway and Docker's Metropolitan Amalgamated Carriage and Wagon Company supplied the equipment. They both served on the board of directors of the Metropolitan Railway and they stuck together during the First World War, with Manville leading the Association of British Chambers of Commerce and Docker presiding over the Federation of British Industry. Motor industry Daimler car 1903 Daimler car 1925 In the automobile industry, as chairman of both Birmingham Small Arms Company and its wholly owned subsidiary The Daimler Company, he personally brought about the introduction of the Knight sleeve- valve engine and its acquisition by Daimler, and the incorporation of the fluid flywheel and epicyclic transmission system throughout Daimler's full range of vehicles. He shared his electrical engineering background with Daimler's managing director, American-born Percy Martin. Together they took Daimler to its greatest success, with Manville serving on its board for 28 years, from 1905 until his death in 1933. With backgrounds as electrical engineers, Martin and Manville often chose projects based on technical viability instead of commercial value. Under their leadership, Daimler had a sedate image, seeming to cater to \\"dowagers or the dead\\". Lanchester was acquired with the intent to show a different image, but in the event their cars, like BSA's, became Daimlers wearing different names. Manville was president of The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders from 1907 to 1913. Manville's election to the House of Commons was an outcome of his association with Daimler. Motorsport In his early days on Daimler's board, Manville drove works-prepared cars in competition. His first wife, Maud, would also compete, driving another car. The Manvilles competed in the five-day Herkomer Trophy in 1905 and 1906. Maud, driving a works-prepared 45 hp Daimler, won the speed section of the 1905 event ahead of Edward, who took second place in that section. In the 1906 event, however, they were uncompetitive against thinly- disguised racing cars, and Maud finished in 11th place, just behind the highest-placed Daimler. The Kaiser's brother, Prince Henry of Prussia, apologised to her for the lack of consideration from most of the other entrants. Manville stated that Daimler would not compete in the event again. Parliament Edward Manville was Unionist member of Parliament for Coventry from 1918 to 1923 and was knighted in 1923 at the end of his term. Involvement with early television development Manville was first chairman of the Baird Television Development Company, which held its first meeting on 18 July 1927. The object of the company was to develop commercially the Baird television and other inventions. As a professional electrical engineer, Manville felt obliged to keep abreast of all of Baird's developments. His frequent questions and suggestions irritated Baird, who altered the doorway to his laboratory to be too narrow for Manville to pass through without effort. Baird said he preferred to keep a distance from Manville's \\"booming voice\\" and just view him at the far end of the boardroom table \\"like a florid sunset seen through a cloud of cigar smoke\\". Commercial exploitation was continued by Baird International Television Limited, launched in June 1928. Government and BBC having become important, Lord Ampthill, a former acting viceroy of India, was made chairman and Manville a director. Other interests and involvements Manville was also chairman of Car and General Insurance Corporation, Reinsurance Corporation and Phoenix Oil and Transport. In addition, he was formerly president of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce and vice-president of the Federation of British Industries, as well as a director of about 15 other companies. When compelled to reveal all directorships by the 1930 Companies Act, Manville reported that he was on 27 boards of directors. He found time for civil and masonic activities and was a Past Master of several City Livery Companies. Death Sir Edward Manville died after a short illness in London on 17 March 1933, aged 70. He was survived by his second wife Rachel, daughter of Mr. John Holmes, a civil engineer of Calcutta who died in 1940. His first wife, Maud, daughter of Colonel C.T. Wallis, had died in 1909. There were no children from either marriage.

A Type 285 gunnery radar was mounted on top of the HACS director and a Type 271/73 surface search radar was installed abaft the two-pounder guns on the forecastle. Woolwichs main deck consisted of armour plate over the machinery spaces and her platform deck was thick over the magazines. Construction and service The ship was ordered on 4 April 1933Lenton, p. 591 as part of the 1932 Naval Construction Programme. She was laid down by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in Govan on the River Clyde on 24 May 1933. Woolwich was launched on 20 September 1934 and completed on 28 June 1935. She was deployed to the Mediterranean after completion and was in Alexandria at the beginning of World War II in September 1939. The ship returned home and was based at Scapa Flow supporting destroyers of the Home Fleet by mid-1940. Woolwich sailed again for the Mediterranean in September; while circumnavigating Africa, she had to put into Mombasa, Kenya for repairs to her boilers before she arrived in Alexandria in November. In mid-June 1942, Vice-Admiral Henry Harwood, Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet, ordered all non-essential ships to leave Alexandria as he was preparing to demolish the port facilities there to prevent their capture by the advancing Panzer Army Africa. Woolwich and the repair ship , escorted by six destroyers, were transferred south of the Suez Canal until the victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein in October allowed them to return to Alexandria. She remained there until late 1943 when she was assigned to the Eastern Fleet and based at Trincomalee for the rest of the war. Woolwich sailed back to England in 1946, but rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet the following year where she served as flagship for the Flag Officer, Mediterranean Fleet Destroyers. The ship sailed from Valletta, Malta on 7 February 1948 for Harwich where she served as a maintenance and accommodation ship for reserve ships based there. Woolwich was refitted in Rosyth in 1952 and then transferred to Gare Loch to perform similar duties there.

The album was created by Steve Marriott, Ian McLagan, Kenney Jones and Rick Wills when they reformed in the late seventies and recorded it along with the album 78 in the Shade. Ronnie Lane left before the album was recorded. Reunion: 1975‚Äì1978 Following the break-up of Faces in 1975, the original Small Faces line-up reformed briefly to film videos miming to the reissued \\"Itchycoo Park\\", which hit the charts again. The group tried recording together again but Lane left after the first rehearsal due to an argument. Unbeknownst to the others, he was just beginning to show the symptoms of multiple sclerosis, and his behaviour was misinterpreted by Marriott and the others as a drunken tantrum. Lane subsequently began recording Rough Mix with the Who's Pete Townshend shortly after the argument. Nevertheless, McLagan, Jones and Marriott decided to stay together as Small Faces, recruiting ex-Peter Frampton and Roxy Music bassist Rick Wills to take Lane's place. This iteration of Small Faces recorded two albums: Playmates (1977) and 78 in the Shade (1978), released on Atlantic Records. Both albums were later reissued on Wounded Bird Records. Guitarist Jimmy McCulloch also briefly joined this line-up after leaving Wings. When McCulloch phoned Paul McCartney, who had found him increasingly difficult to work with, to announce he was joining Marriott, McCartney reportedly said \\"I was a little put out at first, but, well, what can you say to that?\\" McCulloch's tenure with the band lasted only for a few months in late 1977. He recorded only one album, 78 in the Shade in 1978 with the band. Unfortunately for the band, mainstream music in Britain was rapidly changing direction, punk rock having been established around this time. The reunion albums, as a result, were both critical and commercial failures. Small Faces broke up again in 1978.

Naming Etymology The genus \\"Vigna\\" is named for Dominico Vigna, an Italian doctor and horticulturalist who was a professor of botany at the University of Pisa; he died in 1647. The specific epithet \\"marina\\", from the Latin word for \\"sea\\", refers to the plant's coastal habitat. Synonyms Synonyms of this species include: *Dolichos luteus Sw. *Phaseolus marinus *Scytalis anomala *Scytalis retusa E. Mey. *Vigna anomala Walp. *Vigna lutea (Sw.) A. Gray *Vigna repens var. lutea (Sw.) Kuntze *Vigna retusa (E. Mey.) Walp. Hawaiian names In Hawaii, this plant is known by various names, including: *Lemuomakili *Mohihihi *Nanea *Nenea *P≈´hili *P≈´hilihili *P≈´lihilihi *Wahine  ª≈çma ªo * ª≈åkolemakili Description Stem The stems grow up to 3 metres long, and often have purplish stripes. Leaves The leaves are trifoliate and are light green in colour. They grow from the stems, each on a stalk of about 2 to 5 cm long, and are arranged alternately. Small, triangular leaf-like stipules are located at the junction where the leaf stalk meets the stem. Three triple-nerved leaflets comprise each leaf. These are smooth-edged, and broadly oval to oblong in shape, with a pointed tip. They grow from 4 to 10 cm in length, and 2 to 5 cm in width. Flowers Flower The flowers are yellow in colour, and are pea-type in shape. They grow from stalks which have a maximum length of approximately 10 cm. The flowers are between 15 and 18 mm long, and grow in clusters around the tip of the stalk. These flowers occur year round, but mostly in the autumn and early winter. The flowers have no fragrance. Fruit The peas are circular to oblong in shape, and have a greyish-brown colour. They grow within rounded pods in groups of 4 to 9. The pods are up to 8 cm in length and 6 mm wide. The ripened peas are released when the pod opens and then twists. Distribution This species is salt-tolerant and is found on tropical beaches around the world, such as those in Hawaii and on various islands in the Pacific Ocean, Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands, the coast of Bahia, Brazil, the Atlantic and Indian coasts of Africa, Madagascar, the Seychelles, India and Sri Lanka, Indo-China and the Chinese island of Hainan, Malesia, and along the Australian coast in Queensland and the Northern Territory. Habitat Habitat Vigna marina grows at the vegetation line on sandy beaches, frontal dunes, and beach ridges near the seashore. Rarely, it occurs on inland sea cliffs and dry slopes among shrubs up to approximately 395 feet above the sea. Uses and benefits As a treatment to help heal wounds such as boils, running sore, or ulcers (known locally as hƒìhƒì), early Hawaiians ground the leaves, stalks, midribs (kua), and stems of the plant, and applied the softened materials directly onto the affected area. As is the case in many pea species, Vigna marina is able to fix nitrogen from the air around it roots. This is done by microorganisms on the nodules of the roots. The resultant nitrogen is used by the plant, and also increases the nitrogen content in the surrounding sand. This helps other plants in the vicinity to grow. Vigna marina can prevent coastal erosion. Propagation This species will grow from seed. Light scarification can bring the seed out of dormancy and help it germinate. Nodulation can take place without inoculation with any specific rhizobium. Related species V. marina is one of three species of Vigna native to the Hawaiian Islands. One of the others, Vigna adenantha, also known as \\"wild pea\\", was formerly found on O ªahu and Hawai ªi Island but was last reported in the 1850s. Vigna o-wahuensis is a rare species endemic to the Hawaiian Islands and is considered endangered. Vigna marina is a close relative of other Vigna species that are grown as crops worldwide. These include: *Vigna angularis - azuki bean *Vigna mungo - urad bean or black gram *Vigna umbellata - rice bean *Vigna radiata - mung bean *Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis - yardlong bean or Chinese long bean *Vigna unguiculata spp. dekindtiana - black-eyed pea References External links * Image of leaves * Image of flowers * Image of seeds * Images * Images marina Plants described in 1917 Pantropical flora Taxa named by Elmer Drew Merrill ","title":"Vigna marina"},{"id":"34120485","text":"Nebulosa bialbifera is a moth of the family Notodontidae.

As captain of HMS Endymion, he was involved in the action on 14 January 1815 which ended in the capture of the American warship USS President. Early years Hope was the eldest son of Charles Hope, the grandson of Charles Hope-Vere, and the nephew of the army officer Henry Hope who became lieutenant-governor of the Province of Quebec. On 2 April 1798, he joined the yacht on the River Thames as a 3rd Class volunteer. In May 1800, he transferred as a midshipman to the 74-gun third rate ship of the line , which was under the command of his cousin, Captain William Johnstone Hope. Kent took Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercrombie to Egypt where he commanded the British campaign to dislodge the French invasion of Egypt. She then served in blockade of Alexandria. Hope transferred to , another 74-gun third rate. Whilst Swiftsure was at sea, her captain, Benjamin Hallowell, learnt that a French squadron under Admiral Ganteaume had put to sea. Hallowell decided to return to reinforce Sir John Warren's squadron, but on 24 June 1801 Swiftsure encountered Ganteaume's force, which quickly overtook the damaged, slow, and undermanned Swiftsure. The French force consisted of four ships of the line and a frigate. The Indivisible and Dix-Ao√ªt succeeded in shooting away Swiftsures yards and masts, forcing her to surrender. Two men were killed, two were mortally wounded, and another six were wounded aboard Swiftsure, whilst the French lost 33 killed and wounded. Hope was taken prisoner. (The French Navy took Swiftsure into service under her existing name.Capture du Swiftsure) Hope was freed in September and joined the frigate , which was under the command of Captain George Johnstone Hope. He continued to serve on Leda in the Mediterranean and the Home station under Captains John (or James) Hardy and Robert Honyman (or Honeyman). In June 1803 Hope left Leda and transferred to the 74-gun third rates and later the under captains George Johnstone Hope and William Johnstone Hope. Commissioned officer Henry Hope was appointed lieutenant on 3 May 1804. He then joined Captain George Burlton in the 50-gun fourth rate , which had just spent a year undergoing refitting. Hope then sailed with Captain Ross Donnelly on the 32-gun frigate . He was with Narcissus when the British re-occupied the Cape of Good Hope on 16 January 1806. Hope was promoted to commander on 22 January 1806 and was appointed to command the Cruizer-class brig-sloop . He served on her until January 1808. Hope then served under Captain Thomas Seccombe aboard the 56-gun . In January 1808 Glatton and the brig-sloop had received information that the French had captured four Sicilian gunboats and taken them into Scylla, near Reggio, Calabria.Hepper (1994), p.122. On 31 January 1808, as Delight approached the port, a strong current pushed her towards the shore and she grounded. Seccombe went on board Delight to supervise the recovery effort. As they were trying to free Delight, her boats and those of Glatton came under intense fire from the shore. They were unsuccessful in freeing Delight, and Delights captain, Commander Phillip Crosby Handfield, late of , and many of his crew were killed. Although the crew took to the boats, not all were able to escape and a number of the men on her, including Seccombe, became prisoners of war.Grocott (1997), p.251. Glatton came under the command of Commander Henry Hope (acting) until March 1808.Winfield (2008) On 22 May 1808 Hope was made post captain. He took command of the 36-gun fifth rate frigate on 17 November. Next, Hope took command of the 32-gun frigate on 4 May 1809. On October 1809, a squadron under Rear-Admiral George Martin, of Cuthbert Collingwood's fleet, chased an enemy convoy off the south of France. They succeeded in driving two of the three escorting ships of the line, Robuste and Lion, ashore near Frontignan, where their crews burnt them after dismantling them and stripping them of all usable material. The crews of the third ship of the line, Bor√©e, and the frigate Pauline escaped into S√®te.James (1837), Vol. 5, pp.143-4. The transports that had been part of the convoy, including the armed storeship Lamproie, of 18 guns, two bombards (Victoire and Grondeur), and the xebec Normande, sailed into the Bay of Rosas where they hoped that the castle of Rosas, Fort Trinidad and several shore batteries would protect them. On 30 October Topaze, and other ships sent in their boats. By the following morning the British had accounted for all eleven vessels in the bay, burning those they did not bring out. Some of the British boats took heavy casualties; Topaze lost four men killed and eight men wounded. On 21 June 1810, the boats of and Topaze captured two vessels in the bay of Martino in Corsica.This may be San-Martino- di-Lota, near Bastia. A landing party captured a battery of three guns that protected the entrance to the bay. They were able to capture and render the guns unserviceable, and kill or wound a number of the garrison. The British lost one man killed and two wounded in the action. On 24 August Topaze captured the Centinelle.The United service magazine, Vol. 171, p.125. Topaze was also involved in the Battle of Fuengirola in October 1810. In 1811 Captain Hope took command of , a Perseverance-class fifth-rate frigate of a nominal 36 guns. On 29 June 1811 she captured the slave ship Expedition off Mauritius.History 1793-1844 from the newspapers On 21 April 1812, Salsette captured the French privateer Com√®te in the Mediterranean. She carried two 18-pounder guns and had a crew of 45 men. Then on 14 October 1812 Salsette captured the three-masted lugger Mercure off the Isle of Wight.Ouseley reports that she was the former Marie Louise of Cherbourg. This vessel carried 16 guns and had a crew of 70,Norman (1887), p.449. and Salsette took her into Portsmouth.Ouseley (1823), Vol. 3, p.542. War of 1812 Captain Hope took command of on 13 May 1813. Endymion was a 40-gun fifth rate frigate that was being fitted out at Plymouth to counter the American 44-gun frigates, which had made an impact during the early engagements during the War of 1812. Hope then sailed Endymion to the Halifax station. On 7 March 1814, Endymion, and captured the American privateer Mars, which was armed with 15 guns and had a crew of 70 men. In August 1814, together with Armide, Endymion captured the American privateer Herald, of 17 guns and 100 men. In late 1814, Endymion joined the blockading-squadron off New York. On 11 October 1814 Endymion's boats attempted to capture the notorious American privateer Prince de Neufchatel, but were unsuccessful. Becalmed on the south side of Nantucket, the Prince de Neufchatel appeared vulnerable. Captain Henry Hope thereupon sent 111 men in five boats to cut out the privateer, which was defended by 40 Americans. After 20 minutes of savage fighting British casualties amounted to 28 killed, 37 wounded, and 28 taken prisoner. The Americans reported losing 7 men killed and 24 wounded.Ellis (2009), pp. 99-100.Naval Chronicle Capture of USS President On 14 January 1815, , under the command of Commodore Stephen Decatur, left New York for the Indian Ocean. She then fell in with the British blockading squadron, consisting of the razee (56 guns, Captain John Hayes), and the frigates Endymion (Captain Henry Hope), Pomone (38 guns, Captain John Richard Lumley), and (38 guns, Captain Hyde Parker). Immediately, the British squadron gave chase with Majestic leading. At noon, Endymion, being the much better sailer, overhauled her squadron and left them behind. At 2 pm she gained on the President and shortly afterwards both ships exchanged broadsides, with President still trying to escape. Endymion was able to rake President three times and did considerable damage to her; by contrast, President primarily directed her fire at Endymion's rigging in order to slow her down. At 7.58pm, President struck, hoisting a light in her rigging to signify her surrender. Endymion hove to and commenced repairs to her rigging. Captain Hope was unable to take immediate possession of his prize as he had no boats available that would \\"swim\\". Seeing Endymion hove to, Decatur attempted to escape, making sail at 8.30pm and running downwind. Endymion completed her hasty repairs and got under way at 9.05pm. In the meantime both Pomone and Tenedos were closing on President and by 9.05pm, Pomone had caught up, firing two broadsides at President, after which Decatur once again indicated his surrender.Lambert, Andrew (2012) The Challenge - Britain Against America in the War of 1812, (Faber and Faber) According to British accounts, President had lost 35 men killed and 70 wounded, including Decatur. American sources give their losses as 24 killed and 55 wounded. Endymion had 11 killed and 14 wounded.James (1824), vol.6, p. 367. Following the arrival of Endymion and the President in Bermuda, Captain Henry Hope was presented with a silver plate in honour of his success. Soon after Hope presented his officers with silver crooks that were probably made from that plate. The design of a crook was a play on the name Endymion, which had been named after a shepherd of Classical legend. These silver crooks have been named as the Midshipman's Badge, however they were given to the Endymion's 24 officers rather than the midshipman. On 15 January 1815 Hope was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath for his role in the capture of President. Endymion and President arrived at Spithead on 28 March 1815. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issue to any still surviving crew from Endymion of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Endymion wh. President\\". Personal life On 21 July 1828 Hope married Jane Sophia Sawyer, the youngest daughter of Admiral Sir Herbert Sawyer. She died in 1829. Later career Henry Hope was named to be an Extra Naval Aide-de- Camp to His Majesty, on 5 September 1831, and he was named to be a Naval Aide- de-Camp to His Majesty on 9 November 1846. He was appointed rear-admiral on 9 November 1846, vice-admiral on 2 April 1853, and admiral on 20 January 1858.  References  ;Footnotes ;Citations ;See Also * ;Sources *Ellis, James H.

As of 2011, it was one of the four monasteries still operating in the region. Its history goes back to the 14th-century missionary activities of St. Sergius of Radonezh and his disciples. History The monastery was founded by Dmitry Prilutsky, formerly a hegumen of the Nikolsky Monastery in Pereslavl-Zalessky. Dmitry left Pereslavl since he thought it was too crowded, and moved north. He first decided to settle down on the Obnora River, currently in Gryazovetsky District of Vologda Oblast, but he was not accepted warmly by the local population, and he moved further north. At the current location of the monastery, which was at the time relatively far from the city of Vologda, he built a wooden church and the cells. The end of the 14th century was the time of rapid expansion of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and Dmitry Donskoy, the prince of Moscow, considered it very important as an influence point of the Moscow State in the north. The princes of Moscow and later tsars belonged to the main benefactors of the monastery. Vasily III visited the monastery personally in 1528, when he and his wife, Elena Glinskaya, childless for a long time, made a pilgrimage to a number of Russian monasteries in hope to get a child. (The child who was eventually born was Ivan the Terrible). On December 16, 1612, the monastery was captured and burned by Polish-Lithuanian brigands, the so-called Lisowczycy. In August 1924, the monastery was abolished. The buildings were subsequently used for a variety of purposes, including living quarters, a prison, a depot, and a museum. All the buildings consisting the ensemble of the monastery were preserved though. In 1991, the monastery was re- established. The selo of Priluki, where the monastery was located, in 1993 was included into the city of Vologda. As of January 2013, images of the monastery and grounds were available via Google Street View. Architecture The monastery is built as a fortress, has an approximately rectangular shape, and is completely surrounded by a wall, which has four corner towers and three gates. The northern wall has the main gate and the gate Resurrection Church, the western wall has a gate leading to the Vologda River, and the southern wall has the third gate which is now defunct. The wall was completed in 1656. The construction started after the monastery was plundered by Polish armies in the Time of Troubles. The main cathedral, located in the center of the monastery, is the Saint Saviour Cathedral, built in 1537-1542. It was the first stone building in Vologda. The bell-tower was built between 1639 and 1654. In 1811, the cathedral burnt down and was only restored in 1813-1817. In the meanwhile, during the French invasion of Russia, the Napoleon army occupied Moscow, and some of the treasures belonging to the church were speedily evacuated from Moscow. They were kept in Spaso-Prilutsky Monastery, in the cathedral which at the time was still not restored. The cathedral is connected to a set of buildings, including the Presentation Church, built before 1623. The Church of All Saints was built in 1721, and the Church of Saint Catherine originates from 1830.

Whittle's kidnapping and murder dominated national headlines for 11 months. The investigation involved over 400 officers from the West Mercia Constabulary, Staffordshire and West Midlands police forces and the Metropolitan Police. Whittle, aged 17, was kidnapped from her home in Highley, Shropshire, by Donald Neilson, who by that time had committed over 400 burglaries and three murders. He was known to the British press as the Black Panther, for the black balaclava he wore during robberies of post offices. Neilson held Whittle in an underground drainage shaft of a reservoir at Bathpool Park in Kidsgrove, Staffordshire. He had placed a hood over her head, left her naked, and tethered her to the side of the shaft by a wire noose. After what was later seen as a bungled police operation, including two failed attempts to engage with Neilson's demand for a ransom of ¬£50,000, her body was found hanging in the shaft on 7 March 1975. After being arrested 11 months later in Mansfield, in July 1976 at Oxford Crown Court Neilson was convicted of the kidnapping and murder of Whittle, for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Three weeks later he was convicted of the murder of three post office workers, and given three further life sentences. Lesley Whittle Lesley Whittle, born in 1957, was the daughter of George Whittle, a co-owner of Whittle Coaches, and his girlfriend Dorothy. At the time of her kidnapping, she was a student at Wulfrun College, Wolverhampton. Background To avoid estate taxes, George Whittle gave three houses plus ¬£70,000 in cash to Dorothy, ¬£107,000 to his son Ronald, and ¬£82,000 to Lesley during his life. He died in 1970, aged 65. As he had left nothing to her, George's estranged wife, Selina Whittle, began legal proceedings in May 1972 to obtain money from her husband's estate. The story was picked up by the Daily Express. Kidnapping Requiring money, Neilson read about a dispute between Whittle and Selina. He decided he was going to kidnap either Ronald or Dorothy Whittle and hold them until a ¬£50,000 ransom had been paid. He had estimated that the Whittles could easily afford ¬£50,000. Police subsequently found that ex-British Army soldier Neilson had put three years of planning into the kidnapping, having read a 1972 news article pertaining to inheritance Dorothy had been bequeathed when her father had passed away.A History of Policing in England and Wales from 1974: A Turbulent Journey p. 44 On 14 January 1975, Dorothy Whittle returned to the house in Highley, Shropshire, at 1:30 am. Having found her daughter asleep in bed, Dorothy took two sleeping tablets and went to bed herself. Neilson later cut the telephone line (suspecting a burglar alarm) and then entered the Whittles' home through the garage. Encountering Lesley by mistake, he decided to kidnap her instead. Gagging the teenager, who was wearing only her dressing gown and slippers, he took her to his green Morris 1100 car, where he tied her up and laid her down on the back seat. Neilson then drove Lesley to Bathpool Park in Kidsgrove, Staffordshire. There he forced her down into the drainage shaft of the nearby reservoir. Inside the shaft he placed a hood over her head, removed the dressing gown leaving her naked and then tethered her to the side of the shaft by a wire noose. There was a mattress and a sleeping bag. The following morning, after her daughter failed to come down for breakfast, Dorothy discovered in Lesley's bedroom that her daughter's clothes for that day were untouched and a ransom note punched out on a 6 ft strip of Dymotape. It demanded ¬£50,000 and instructed the family not to contact the police, but to wait for a telephone call at a phonebox at the Swan shopping centre in Kidderminster that evening. Dorothy picked up her home telephone to ring Lesley's brother Ronald, but on finding it dead, rushed in her dressing gown to her car. She drove to Ronald's house and then returned with Ronald and his wife, Gaynor, back to the Whittle family home, where they found a second copy of the Dymotape ransom note tucked inside a box of Turkish Delight in the lounge. After finding that Lesley's dressing gown and slippers were missing, confirming that she had been kidnapped, Ronald Whittle immediately called the police. Investigation An investigation led by Detective Chief Superintendent Robert Booth of West Mercia Police, with assistance from Scotland Yard sent a team led by Commander John Morrison that included DCI Walter Boreham. During the height of the investigation, it involved over 250 officers from the Shropshire, Staffordshire and West Midlands police forces, plus Scotland Yard. But a series of police bungles and other circumstances delayed the investigation. The story quickly leaked to the press, and was carried on the evening television news that day. No telephone call came to the Swan shopping centre phonebox in Kidderminster. At 11:45 pm on 16 January, in a tape played by Neilson over the telephone, a message recorded by Lesley told her family that she was alright, and that someone from her family was to go to the phonebox in Kidsgrove, Stoke-on-Trent, to retrieve a second message that was behind the back-board of the phonebox. Verifying the voice as Lesley's, it was agreed that Ronald Whittle would undertake the drop, monitored by a police radio network that could give him assistance within two minutes. After the police had taken two hours to make extensive arrangements, Ronald left Bridgnorth police station at 1:30 am on 17 January, with a suitcase packed with ¬£50,000 to drive to Kidsgrove. But being unfamiliar with the area he got lost, eventually arriving at Kidsgrove Post Office phonebox late. After searching for thirty minutes, he found a Dymotape message that directed him to Bathpool Park, which was situated about away. The message instructed him to: Arriving at Bathpool Park 90 minutes late, Ronald turned into the \\"No Entry\\" sign as instructed, but in the dark he did not see the low wall that edged the railway bridge, and drove to the end of the lane. He stopped, flashed his lights and then got out of the car and shouted; there was no-one there. Ronald left the park and met up again with the police at an arranged meeting point. West Mercia police officers put the blame for the failed operation onto Staffordshire Police, after a patrol car was seen driving through the area. A courting couple in a car had also parked near where the ransom was to have been left. A subsequent search of Bathpool Park by police revealed no clues. A week later, West Midlands Police contacted West Mercia. On the same night of the failed ransom drop, a car had been left near the Dudley Freightliner Terminal, where security guard Gerald Smith had been shot in the back six times, and was now in hospital recovering. In the car were a cassette tape with Lesley Whittle's voice on it, asking her relatives to co-operate with the kidnapper, her slippers, and a roll of plastic tape, all of which linked Neilson to the kidnapping. Ballistics evidence and finger prints on the cartridges also linked the same man to the Freightliner shooting, the previous post office robberies and thus the Black Panther murders. On 10 February 1975, the news black-out was lifted. On 5 March, Chief Superintendent Booth and Ronald Whittle appeared together on both national and local television. The next day a headmaster at a local school told police that a pupil had brought him a piece of Dymotape that read \\"DROP SUITCASE INTO HOLE\\" and, subsequently, other pupils had found a torch wedged in the grilles of what was locally known as the \\"glory-hole\\", one of the capped ventilation shafts of the old Harecastle Tunnel. The boys who found the torch in Bathpool Park had given it to the headmaster several weeks before, but neither had realised the significance of the find until the television broadcast. On 6 March 1975, police started a second thorough search of Bathpool Park, starting with the glory-hole, within which a detective constable found a Dymotape machine and a roll of Dymotape. An inspection of the second shaft revealed nothing. The third shaft, the deepest of the three and once an air ventilation shaft for Nelson's Coal Mine, was then uncapped. As it was subject to HM Inspectorate of Mines regulations it had to be checked for gas, and so late in the day the investigation was suspended. On Friday, 7 March 1975, after gas tests had been passed, police officers and mine rescue staff entered the third shaft. Accessed by a vertical ladder, down on the first landing, a broken police torch was found from the previous day's work. A further down on a second landing, a cassette tape recorder was found. A further down on a third landing, the team found a rolled up sleeping bag that was acting as a pillow, a yellow foam mattress and a survival blanket. Whittle's body was found hanging from a steel wire, only from the bottom of the shaft. Subsequent inspection of the floor of the shaft, below the third landing, found 3 inch strips of elastoplast which had been used as a blindfold; a pair of brown size 7 trainers; more Dymotape; a cassette tape; a microphone and lead; a Thermos flask; blue cord trousers; and a reporter's note pad. Out of all of the items recovered from the three shafts which were later forensically inspected by the police, there was only one partial fingerprint, on the reporter's notepad. After four months of every other fingerprint investigation in the nation practically being put on hold, no match could be found. Consequent actions Chief Superintendent Bob Booth, who led the investigation into Whittle's kidnapping, was subsequently demoted from CID to a uniformed beat officer. DCI Walter Boreham later recalled that, although the Scotland Yard team finished up with several million handwritten index cards, as well as tens of thousands of statements and other documents, Home Office computer scientists were sceptical that computerising the case, then a rarity, would be an improvement. Alex Rennie, who was Chief Constable of West Mercia Police when Whittle was murdered, had all of the notes not used during the trial destroyed when he retired. Rennie, in retirement, later said: Cause of Whittle's death and post mortem findings It is widely believed that Neilson pushed Whittle off the ledge in the drainage shaft, strangling her. An alternative scenario is that Neilson was not present when Whittle died and that he fled on the night of the failed ransom collection without returning to the shaft, believing the police were closing in on him, leaving Whittle alive in the dark for a considerable period of time before falling to her death. Post-mortem examination showed that Whittle had not died from strangulation but had died instantly from vagal inhibition. The shock of the fall had caused her heart to stop beating. The pathologist, Dr John Brown, reported that this would have been induced by high blood pressure in her carotid artery, caused by the constrictive wire loop around her neck triggering an alarm to her brain via the vagus nerve. The brain's response to this urgent signal for reduction in artery pressure would be to radically slow down the heart, and when that failed, her heart stopped altogether. The pathologist reported that Whittle weighed only 7 stone (98 lb or 44 kg) when found; her stomach and intestines were completely empty, she had lost a considerable amount of weight and she was emaciated. Arrest and conviction Neilson subsequently became Britain's most wanted man. In December 1975, two police officers spotted a man seen acting suspiciously in Mansfield, who turned out to be Neilson. Armed with a sawn-off shotgun, he was arrested with the help of several customers in a nearby fish and chip shop. In the subsequent investigation, Neilson's fingerprints were found to match one of those in the drain shaft. In the interview at Kidsgrove police station when he confessed to Whittle's kidnapping, Neilson gave an 18-page statement to DCS Harold Wright, head of Staffordshire CID, and Commander Morrison of Scotland Yard, with the statement hand-written by DCI Walter Boreham. During his trial at Oxford Crown Court, Neilson's defence lawyer suggested that Whittle had accidentally fallen from the ledge and had hanged herself, and that Neilson had cared for her, feeding her chicken soup, spaghetti and meatballs, and buying her fish and chips and chicken legs. In July 1976, Neilson was convicted of Whittle's murder, for which he was given a life sentence; and a total of 61 years (running concurrently, with the longest being 21 years) for other offences. Three weeks later he was convicted of the murder of three post office workers, and given three further life sentences. The offences regarding the shooting of security guard Gerald Smith were left on file, as Smith had died more than a year and a day after the shooting. 2008 appeal and Neilson's death In 2008, Neilson was suffering from motor neurone disease and appealed against his sentence, requesting it be commuted to a maximum of 30 years. Mr Justice Teare ruled that he must never be released from prison, saying: Neilson died in hospital, still serving his sentence, in December 2011.

A direct sequel to Dead or Alive (2010), it is Clancy's first of three collaborations with Greaney and features Jack Ryan Jr. and The Campus as they try to avert a nuclear threat from a rogue Pakistani general, as well as his father Jack Sr. in his presidential campaign. The book debuted at number two on the New York Times bestseller list. Plot summary A year after the Emir's capture, The Campus investigates Pakistani intelligence official and brigadier general Riaz Rehan. Unbeknownst to them, Rehan plots to bring his country and India to nuclear war by orchestrating terrorist attacks behind the scenes on behalf of terror groups allegedly backed by the Pakistani government, aiming to create an Islamic caliphate in its aftermath. For the final step of his operation, he steals two nuclear weapons from the Pakistani military armory and then secretly gives them to Dagestani terrorist organization Jamaat Shariat, who would then use them to attack Moscow using space delivery rockets. Meanwhile, former president Jack Ryan is in the middle of his presidential campaign and ahead at the polls. Even though his opponent and successor Ed Kealty publicly reveals the capture of the Emir in their second presidential debate in a desperate attempt to win voters, Ryan opposes his plan to a public trial for the terrorist. The resulting turnaround in public opinion enrages Czech billionaire and Kealty supporter Paul Laska, later launching a vendetta to discredit Ryan six weeks before the presidential election. Laska's progressive organization provides the Emir with a legal defense team. After CIA deputy director Charles Sumner Alden identifies Campus operatives John Clark and Domingo \\"Ding\\" Chavez from the Emir's rough sketches of the men who captured him, Laska enlists the help of SVR officer Valentin Kovalenko for collecting information about the former's CIA activities. Kovalenko uncovers Clark's unauthorized assassination of an East German Stasi operative in Berlin in 1981, which is not part of the full presidential pardon Ryan had signed for his friend and making him accountable for murder. Laska covertly gives the dossier to Kealty, who then orders the FBI to hunt down Clark. Campus operative Sam Driscoll goes to Miranshah, Pakistan to investigate a lead on Rehan regarding his connection with the Haqqani terror network. However, he was captured by Rehan's men in an attack on his safehouse, while his asset, ISI official Mohammed al Darkur, barely escapes. Driscoll was later kept by Haqqani forces in a North Waziristan prison. Meanwhile, Chavez and his colleagues Dominic \\"Dom\\" Caruso and Jack Ryan Jr. surveil Rehan's safe house in Abu Dhabi and later rescue al Darkur from Rehan's men; the Pakistani general barely escapes. They find out that Driscoll had been captured, and after al Darkur later pinpoints Driscoll's whereabouts, Chavez, Caruso, and Ryan, along with the ISI major and his trusted Zarrar battalion commandos, storm the Haqqani prison and free Driscoll. Meanwhile, Clark goes on the run and travels to Europe in order to find out the source of the information on the Berlin hit. It was revealed that he had been personally tasked by his friend and CIA station chief of Berlin with giving money to extorting Stasi officers who had caught him in a honey trap; when it became apparent that the Stasi officers wanted more than their fair share, Clark kills one of them while escaping from the botched swap. As soon as Clark finds out about Kovalenko and Laska in Moscow, he gets captured by French investigators hired as cutouts by Laska. After the Frenchmen fail to get information from Clark, Laska blackmails Kovalenko into torturing him for information about his current employer. In Kazakhstan, Jamaat Shariat forces led by the head of a Russian space company allied with them hijack the Baikonur Cosmodrome, threatening to launch the nuclear-tipped missiles and send them into Moscow unless their imprisoned commander has been freed from military custody. When Russian special forces and later Rainbow fail to retake the facility, the desperate Russian government decides to assign Clark as the temporary head of Rainbow in order to resolve the crisis. The FSB then frees Clark from Kovalenko, who is arrested. The former then contacts Chavez to take part in the operation, which becomes successful. However, they find out that the hijackers had been fooled by Rehan into using only one nuclear weapon and that the Pakistani had switched out the other bomb at the last minute, intent on using it himself to attack India. Meanwhile, the CIA tracks down Rehan to war- torn Lahore; Ryan, Caruso, and al Darkur are immediately deployed there. When they find out about the missing nuke, Ryan later dispatches Rehan after a lengthy chase across the train tracks, while Caruso and al Darkur defuse the bomb. Ryan wins the presidential election with a narrow percentage of the popular vote. Alden was later arrested, and the Emir was sent to Guantanamo Bay. However, Ryan Junior's girlfriend, a CIA intelligence officer, is revealed to be a spy planted by Alden to find out his affiliation with Clark and The Campus.

A year later, the mass-market paperback edition of the book also peaked at number two in the same list. In addition, it debuted at number nine on the USA Today's Best-selling Books list. Critical The novel received positive reviews. Chicago Tribune praised the book, saying that \\"Ultimately, it's Clancy's gift for taking three novels' worth of plotting and knitting it into a single continuous and compelling story that makes this new offering so successful.\\" The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette gave it a mixed review, noting the implausibility of the plot but concluding that \\"the action is nearly nonstop and only occasionally wildly improbable; the description of weapons and tactics employed by protagonists and antagonists is accurate and comprehensive, and is inserted smoothly into the narrative.\\" References 2011 American novels American thriller novels Techno-thriller novels Novels by Tom Clancy Ryanverse G.

History The company is named after the Norwegian John J. Tokheim. Working in a hardware store in Iowa, he was conscious of the dangers of storing fuel. In 1898, he designed an exterior storage system, served by a modified water pump. This development had the advantage of allowing him to accurately meter the delivery of fuel. In 1901, he patented the world's first vehicle fuel dispenser.T. Coulibaly (2007), Il y a un si√®cle, l'automobile, pp. 19-20 The popularity of his invention, the Tokheim Dome Oil Pump, led to the founding of the Tokheim Manufacturing Company in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 1901. In 1918, a group of executives from Fort Wayne, Indiana, purchased the company and moved the business there. It later grew to become Tokheim Corporation.

The presenter Ri Chun-hee announced that he had died on 17 December at 8:32 am of a massive heart attack while travelling by train to an area outside Pyongyang. Reportedly, he had received medical treatment for cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases. During the trip though, he was said to have had an advanced acute myocardial infarction, complicated with a serious heart shock. His son Kim Jong-un was announced as North Korea's next leader with the title of \\"The Great Successor\\" during the same newscast. Jong-il's funeral was held on 28 December in Pyongyang, with a mourning period lasting until the following day. Announcement North Korean State media did not report Kim Jong-il's death until 51 hours after it occurred, apparently due to the political jockeying and discussions that surrounded the official version of Jong-il's legacy, as well as agreeing upon the membership of the Funeral Committee of Kim Jong-il. On the morning of 19 December, all work units, schools, government agencies, and military personnel were informed of a major announcement to take place at noon. At noon, Ri Chun-hee, a Korean Central Television news anchor, clad in full black traditional Korean clothing, announced the death of Kim Jong-il. Ri had previously announced the death of Kim Il-sung in 1994. During the announcement, a portrait of a smiling, idealized image of Kim Jong-il was released, continuing the tradition of issuing official posthumous portraits of supreme leaders of North Korea after their death. Following the official notice, a male news anchor wearing a suit and black tie proceeded to announce the entire funeral committee of Kim Jong- il in order of the rankings established by the authorities. The committee had 233 names; Kim Jong-un was ranked first. However, it was reported in December 2012 by South Korean media that he had died in a fit of rage over construction faults in a crucial power plant project at Huichon in Jagang Province. Speculation by South Korea The head of South Korea's National Intelligence Service said surveillance footage revealed that Kim's personal train, on which he is said to have died, did not move over the weekend. This implied that the train was stationary when North Korean authorities claimed he had died. According to editors of The Chosun Ilbo newspaper, it was reported circumstances surrounding Kim's death were inconsistent with what would be generally expected during official business trips: specifically inclement weather conditions were present and the time of day when Kim was supposedly travelling conflicted with his usual circadian rhythm. Furthermore, a low number of witnesses observed the events. Reactions Many countries, organizations, and individuals issued reactions to the death. According to CNN, reactions were \\"somewhat muted\\" in comparison to deaths of other world leaders. Just a few countries reacted immediately after Kim's death was announced on North Korea's KCTV. Some countries, like the United States, took the opportunity to comment on their relationship with South Korea. South Korea decided not to offer official condolences, mirroring both worsened relations after the ROKS Cheonan sinking and the bombardment of Yeonpyeong and its position after the death of Kim Il-sung in 1994. Chinese Foreign Ministry called Kim a \\"great leader\\" and added that Beijing would continue to offer its support. Japan expressed condolences and said it hoped Kim's death would not affect the region adversely. Reactions in Europe were \\"a mix of hope and watchfulness\\". In North Korea, the official reaction was grief and support for the succession of Kim Jong-un. Funeral committee North Korea announced a 232-member funeral committee headed by Kim Jong-un that planned and oversaw Jong-il's funeral, which took place on 28 December. Observers believe the order of names on the list gives clues to the rankings of individuals in the regime's power structure with Kim Jong-un's position on top a further indication that he is Jong-il's successor as supreme leader. According to Kim Keun-sik of Kyungnam University, \\"The list is in the order of members of the standing committee of the Politburo, then members and candidate members. It shows that the party will be stronger power than the military,\\" because Kim Jong-il's brother-in-law Jang Song-taek or O Kuk-ryol, the vice-chairman of the National Defense Commission, are listed further down.\\" The National Funeral Committee released the following details on 19 December 2011: Members The 232 members of the funeral committee were: # Kim Jong-un # Kim Yong-nam # Choe Yong-rim # Ri Yong-ho # Kim Yong-chun # Jon Pyong-ho # Kim Kuk-thae # Kim Ki-nam # Choe Thae-bok # Yang Hyong-sop # Kang Sok-ju # Pyon Yong-rip # Ri Yong-mu # Kim Kyong-hui # Kim Yang-gon # Kim Yong-il # Pak To- chun # Choe Ryong-hae # Jang Song-thaek # Ju Kyu-chang # Kim Rak-hui # Thae Jong-su # Kim Phyong-hae # Kim Jong-gak # U Tong-chuk # Kim Chang-sop # Mun Kyong-dok # Ri Thae-nam # O Kuk-ryol # Kim Chol-man # Ri Ul-sol # Jon Ha-chol # Kang Nung-su # Ro Tu-chol # Jo Pyong-ju # Han Kwang-bok # Paek Se-bong # Ri Yong-su # Choe Hui-jong # O Il-jong # Kim Jong-im # Chae Hui-jong # Kim Ki- ryong # Jang Pyong-gyu # Kim Pyong-ryul # Hong In-bom # Ri Man-gon # Ju Yong- sik # Kwak Pom-gi # O Su-yong # Ro Pae-gwon # Pak Thae-dok # Kim Hi-thaek # Kang Yang-mo # Rim Kyong-man # Kim Kyong-ok # Kim Myong-guk # Kim Won-hong # Hyon Chol-hae # Han Tong-gun # Jo Kyong-chol # Pak Jae-gyong # Pyon In-son # Yun Jong-rin # Jong Myong-do # Ri Pyong-chol # Choe Sang-ryo # Kim Yong-chol # Kang Phyo-yong # Kim Hyong-ryong # Ri Yong-hwan # Kim Chun-sam # Choe Kyong- song # Ri Myong-su # Jon Hui-jong # Ri Yong-gil # Hyon Yong-chol # Choe Pu-il # Yang Tong-hun # Ri Pong-juk # Kim Song-chol # Pak Kwang-chol # Ri Pyong-sam # Jon Chang-bok # O Kum-chol # Kim In-sik # Kim Song-dok # Ryo Chun-sok # Pak Sung-won # Ri Yong-chol # Pak Ui-chun # Kim Hyong-sik # Kim Thae-bong # Jon Kil-su # Ri Mu-yong # An Jong-su # Ri Ryong-nam # Ryu Yong-sop # Pak Myong- chol # Kim Yong-jin # Jang Chol # Song Ja-rip # Kim Jong-suk # Kang Tong-yun # Kim Pyong-ho # Cha Sung-su # Ryang Man-gil # Yun Tong-hyon # Ko Pyong-hyon # Ri Pong-dok # Pak Jong-gun # Choe Yong-dok # Jong In-guk # Jon Ryong-guk # Ri Hyong-gun # Hwang Sun-hui # Paek Kye-ryong # Kim Tong-il # Kim Tong-i # Ri Jae-il # Pak Pong-ju # Jong Myong-hak # Kang Kwan-il # Hwang Pyong-so # Kwon Hyok-bong # Hong Sung-mu # Kim U-ho # Han Chang-sun # Ri Chun-il # Ri Thae-sop # Jo Song-hwan # Tong Yong-il # Ri Chang-han # Ko Su-il # Ri Kuk-jun # Sin Sung-hun # Ri Thae-chol # Yang In-guk # Ri Hi-su # Ri Chol # Hyon Sang-ju # Ri Myong-gil # Ro Song-sil # Tong Jong-ho # Kang Min-chol # Kim Hui-yong # Jo Yong-chol # Hwang Hak-won # An Tong-chun # Paek Ryong-chon # Hong Kwan-sun # Ri Su-yong # Kim Yong-ho # Pang Ri-sun # Choe Chun-sik # Ri Je-son # Ri Sang- gun # Ri Hong-sop # Cha Yong-myong # Kang Kwan-ju # Thae Hyong-chol # Kim Pyong-hun # Kim Kye-gwan # Han Chang-nam # Kim Chang-myong # Jon Chang-rim # O Chol-san # Son Chong-nam # Jong Un-hak # Cha Kyong-il # Kang Ki-sop # Choi Tae-il # Choe Yong-do # Ri Yong-ju # Jon Kwang-rok # Ri Chan-hwa # So Tong- myong # Jon Song-ung # Ji Jae-ryong # Kim Yong-jae # Ri Yong-ho # Hong So-hon # Kim Tong-il # Kim Tong-un # Kim Pong-ryong # Jo Jae-yong # Choe Chan-gon # Ryom In-yun # Kim Chon-ho # Jang Ho-chan # Song Kwang-chol # Ri Ki-su # Ri Jong-sik # Choe Hyon # Jang Myong-hak # Kang Hyong-bong # Kim Chung-gol # Kim Yong-gwang # Choe Kwan-jun # Jang Yong-gol # Kim Myong-sik # Ho Song-gil # No Kwang-chol # Jong Pong-gun # Pak Chang-bom # Choe Pong-ho # Jong Mong-phil # Jon Kyong-son # Ri Song-gwon # Choe Yong # Kim Thae-mun # Kim Yong-suk # Cha Jin-sun # Ri Min-chol # Ri Il-nam # Kim Chang-su # Pak Myong-sun # Choe Pae- jin # Kim Chol # Sim Chol-ho # O Ryong-il # Kye Yong-sam # Ryu Hyon-sik # Ko Myong-hui # Pang Yong-uk # Jang Jong-ju # Ho Kwang-uk # Ji Tong-sik # Jong Pong-sok # Choe Kwon-su # Kim Yong-dae # Ryu Mi-yong Lying in state On 20 December, Jong-il's embalmed body lay in state in a glass coffin at the Kumsusan Memorial Palace, where his father Kim Il-sung is also interred, for an 11-day mourning period prior to the funeral. Like his father, Kim's body was covered in a red flag and surrounded by blossoms of his namesake flowers, red kimjongilia. It is expected that the body will be placed next to his father's bier following the funeral and mourning period. As solemn music played, Kim Jong-un entered the hall to view his father's bier, surrounded by military honour guards. He observed a moment of solemn silence, then circled the bier, followed by other officials.Kim Jong-un pays respects to Kim Jong- il's body as it is displayed in North Korea, The Telegraph On Saturday 24 December Kim Jong-un made a third visit to the palace where his father's body is lying in state. At this broadcast, Jang Sung-taek, whom South Korean intelligence assumed would play larger roles supporting the heir, stood with military uniform near young Kim, who wept this time, as he paid respects to Kim Jong-il's body lying in state. Funeral and memorial service The funeral itself occurred on 28 December. The , 3-hour funeral procession was covered in snow (which local newscasters described as \\"heaven's tears\\") as soldiers beat their chests and called out \\"Father, Father.\\" A Lincoln Continental limousineAmericans Are Prominent at the Funeral of Kim Jong-il carried a giant portrait of Jong-il. Jong-il's casket, draped by the Korean Workers' Party flag, was carried on top of another Lincoln Continental hearse while Kim Jong-un and his uncle Jang Sung-taek were immediately behind. Army chief of the general staff Ri Yong-ho and defence minister Vice-Marshal Kim Yong-chun walked along the opposite side of the vehicle during the procession segments in the Kumsusan Memorial Palace. The procession returned to Kumsusan Palace where Jong-un stood flanked by the top party and military officials who are expected to be his inner circle of advisers as rifles fired 21 times, then saluted again as goose-stepping soldiers carrying flags and rifles marched by the palace square.Thousands mourn at N. Korean leader‚Äôs funeral The Associated Press Posted : Wednesday 28 December 2011 8:48:57 Reportedly, Jong-il's body will be embalmed and put on display indefinitely in the manner of Kim Il-sung and other Communist leaders such as Lenin, Mao, and Ho Chi Minh. The convoy during the funeral procession was composed of lead patrol cars, the funeral hearse and its escorts, military escorts, motorised colour guards, an OB van of Korean Central Television, various cars (including a fleet of black Mercedes), and trucks carrying wreaths and five military bands from the KPA. On the day of the memorial service, 29 December, Chairman of the Presidium, Kim Yong-nam, gave an address to mourners gathered in Kim Il-sung Square. Kim Young-nam told mourners that \\"The great heart of comrade Kim Jong-il has ceased to beat... such an unexpected and early departure from us is the biggest and the most unimaginable loss to our party and the revolution,\\" and that North Korea would \\"transform the sorrow into strength and courage 1,000 times greater under the leadership of comrade Kim Jong-un.\\" The chairman also affirmed Kim Jong-un's position as his father's successor saying \\"Respected Comrade Kim Jong-un is our party, military and country‚Äôs supreme leader who inherits great comrade Kim Jong-il‚Äôs ideology, leadership, character, virtues, grit and courage\\". General Kim Jong-gak addressing the memorial service on behalf of the military, saying \\"Our people's military will serve comrade Kim Jong-un at the head of our revolutionary troops and will continue to maintain and complete the Songun accomplishments of great leader Kim Jong-il\\". Songun refers to Kim Jong-il's policy of prioritising the \\"military first\\" in economic decisions. Kim Jong-un did not make an address but stood with his head bowed, watching from a balcony of the Grand People's Study House, overlooking the square. He was flanked by his aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, her husband, Jang Sung-taek, and senior party and military officials. After the speeches, and a nationwide observance of three-minute silence, a row of heavy artillery guns were fired off in a 21-gun salute followed by a cacophony of sirens, horns and whistles sounded off simultaneously from trains and ships across the country to mark the end of the mourning period. The assembly concluded with a military band playing The Internationale. State television then broadcast a military choir and wind band performing The Song of General Kim Jong Il to formally conclude. Kim Jong-un's elder brothers, Kim Jong-nam and Kim Jong-chol, are not known to have been in attendance either at the lying in state or on either date, the funeral or the memorial service. The funeral showcased seven officials who are believed to be mentors or major aides to Kim Jong-un: Jang Song-taek, Mr. Kim's uncle and a vice-chairman of the National Defense Commission; Kim Ki-nam, North Korea's propaganda chief; Choe Tae-bok, the party secretary in charge of external affairs; Vice Marshal Ri Yong-ho, head of the military's general staff; Kim Yong-chun, the defence minister; Kim Jong-gak, a four-star general whose job is to monitor the allegiance of other generals; and U Dong-chuk, head of the North's secret police and spy agency.North Korea Declares Kim Jong-un Supreme Leader (NYT) On 1 January 2012 the Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun reported that Kim Jong-Nam secretly flew to Pyongyang from Macau on 17 December 2011, after learning about his father's death that day and is presumed to have accompanied Kim Jong-Un when paying his last respects to their father. He left after a few days to return to Macau and was not in attendance at the funeral in order to avoid speculation about the succession. According to Daily NK, anyone who did not participate in the organised mourning sessions or did not seem genuine enough in their sorrow has been sentenced to at least six months in a labour camp. Mourners were also barred from wearing hats, gloves or scarves even though the temperature that day was ‚Äîpresumably so authorities could check to make sure they were displaying sufficient grief. North Korea angrily denied this accusation, blaming it on \\"reptile media\\" in the pay of the South Korean government. A photo slideshow from The Los Angeles Times does show multiple mourners with gloves and scarves. Reports of mourning The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) claimed that strange natural phenomena occurred in North Korea around the time of Kim Jong-il's death: In the past, the North Korean government has been known to encourage stories of miraculous deeds and supernatural events credited to Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il. KCNA also claimed that more than five million North Koreans, more than 25% of the national population, had shown up to mourn Kim.

Both nations are members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, Association of Academies of the Spanish Language and the United Nations. History Mexico and the Philippines share many traditions and customs, which derive from ties established over 400 years. In 1521 Hern√°n Cort√©s conquered the Aztec empire; and in the same year, Ferdinand Magellan travelled to Asia and claimed the Philippine islands for the Spanish crown. In 1543, after their discovery, the explorer Ruy L√≥pez de Villalobos sailed from Barra de Navidad, Jalisco, Mexico, to recognize and name these islands. They were named the Philippine Islands, in honor of Prince Felipe of Asturias.Philippine History In 1565, Spanish Governor General Miguel Lopez de Legazpi claimed the Philippines as a Spanish Colony and designated Manila as its capital in 1571. Due to its distance from Spain, the Spanish Government assigned Manila's administration and government to the Viceroyalty of New Spain for two and a half centuries. Evangelization and commercialization constituted the core of intercontinental ties between Asia and America that materialized with the Manila-Acapulco galleons trade.Bilateral relations between Mexico and the Philippines (in Spanish) Due to the grand exchange with the Philippines in those days, many cultural traits were adopted by one another, with Mexicans remaining in the Philippines, and Filipinos establishing in Mexico, particularly the central west coast, near the port town of Acapulco. Many Nahuatl words were adopted and popularized in the Philippines, such as Tianggui (market fair) and Zapote (a fruit). Philippines under the Viceroyalty of New Spain The Philippines was built as a Spanish colony in 1565, when Miguel Lopez de Legazpi was appointed Governor General. He selected Manila as the capital in 1571. The islands were very remote, so the Spanish Royal Family commissioned the Philippine government administration to the Viceroyalty of New Spain based in Mexico City for over two and half centuries. Hence many of the Filipino governors were Mexican-Creole. The army was recruited from all the populations of New Spain, which led to ethnic and cultural mingling between Mexicans and Filipinos. Evangelization and commerce connected America and Asia, exemplified by the galleon trade. The trade between Canton and Acapulco passed through Manila, where Chinese ships came laden with silks and porcelain to be sent to America, in exchange for silver. And the exchange of ideas accompanied the exchange of products. Independent relationships President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto and Secretary of Foreign Affairs Claudia Ruiz Massieu visit the monument to the 201st Fighter Squadron in Manila, November 2015. In 1842, after the colonial period, Mexico stationed an independent representative in Manila. However, the earliest reference to a Mexican diplomat in the Philippines is found during the Revolution, in the Porfiriato, with the appointment, in 1878, of Evaristo Hernandez Butler, as Consul. During World War II, Mexico participated in the Pacific campaign against Japan and sent the 201 Squadron, with a contingent of the Mexican Expeditionary Air Force, which arrived in Manila on 30 April 1945, commanded by Colonel Antonio Cardenas Rodriguez. The Mexican air force participated in the Battle of Luzon. After Philippine independence The independence of the Philippines brought forth a new era of relations between these countries. Mexico dispatched an envoy to participate in the festivities to celebrate the birth of the Southeast Asian nation. Diplomatic ties between both countries were formalized on 14 April 1953. The year of 1964 was decreed the \\"Year of Philippine-Mexican Friendship\\" to celebrate the Fourth Centennial of the expedition of Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi. In modern day, the conquest of the Philippines is seen as a Spanish initiative, while Mexico is viewed as a country of historical link and friendship, and several groups intend on strengthening the bond between the two countries.Relaciones bilaterales entre M√©xico y las Filipinas (in Spanish) The Philippine Legation in Mexico opened its doors, with Carlos Guti√©rrez Macias, as Minister Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, on 17 September 1953. It was elevated to the rank of an embassy on 25 July 1961. That same year, Mexico opened an embassy in Manila. High-level visits Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos attending the North‚ÄìSouth Summit in Canc√∫n along with his Mexican counterpart President Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo, 1981 During the presidency of Diosdado Macapagal, the President of Mexico, Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos, paid a state visit to the Philippines from October 20 to 23, 1962, to respond to the trip to Mexico in 1960, by then Vice President Macapagal. The year 1964 was designated the Year of the Mexican-Filipino Friendship to celebrate the fourth centenary of the expedition of Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo visited Mexico on 21 November 2001 to attend the international conference of the Christian Democratic parties, at which President Vicente Fox represented Mexico. President Arroyo was the guest of Mexico during the Tenth APEC Leaders Meeting held in La Paz, Baja California in October 2002. In November 2011, former Mexican First Lady Margarita Zavala made a two-day special visit to the Philippines. Margarita Zavala met the Philippine President in the Malaca√±ang Palace. She also visited Fort Santiago and the Nayong Kabataan shelter for children. Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto made a visit to the Philippines on 17 November 2015 on during the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Manila. During his visit, President Pe√±a Nieto and Philippine President Benigno Aquino III discussed enhancing trade relations and witnessed the signing of bilateral agreements on the avoidance of double taxation, tourism cooperation, and combating illegal drug trade.

UNESCO Partnership In late 2014, the idea to nominate the Manila‚ÄìAcapulco Galleon Trade Route was initiated by the Mexican ambassador to UNESCO with the Filipino ambassador to UNESCO after a meeting between the two sides during a documentary showing of the galleons was held in Cuernavaca, Mexico.http://mexicope.dfa.gov.ph/site-administrator/events2/123-manila- acapulco-galleon An Experts' Roundtable Meeting was held at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) on 23 April 2015 as part of the preparation of the Philippines for the possible transnational nomination of the Manila‚ÄìAcapulco Galleon Trade Route to the World Heritage List. The nomination will be made jointly with Mexico. The meeting focused on the tornaviaje, shipyards in the Bicol region, underwater archaeology, maps and cartography, fortifications in the Philippines, food, textile, and historical dimension. The papers presented and discussed during the roundtable meeting will be synthesized into a working document to establish the route's outstanding universal value. The Mexican side reiterated that they will also follow suit with the preparations for the route's nomination. Spain has also backed the nomination of the route in the World Heritage List and has also suggested the archives related to the route under the possession of the Philippines, Mexico, and Spain to be nominated as part of another UNESCO list, the Memory of the World Register.http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/07/05/1473367/spain-backs- inclusion-galleon-trade-route-world-heritage-list The Gale√≥n: Manila‚ÄìAcapulco Galleon Museum, or Museo de Galleon, had its soft opening in the capital of the Philippines in 2017.

EHDN was founded in 2003 and is financially supported by the CHDI Foundation. EHDN provides an infrastructure for multi-national observational studies and interventional clinical trials in HD; organises biannual plenary meetings attended by professionals and HD family members; supports a range of working groups focusing on aspects of the disease; and provides endorsement and seed funding for individual research projects. At December 2011, EHDN had over 1000 regular members in 26 countries. EHDN's activities are governed by an elected Scientific and Bioethics Advisory Committee and an Executive Committee. The core project of EHDN is the REGISTRY study, a multi-national observational project that aims to study the natural history of HD and expedite recruitment of suitable volunteers into clinical trials. At December 2011, REGISTRY had enrolled over 7700 subjects in 145 sites, and generated nine peer-reviewed publications.

The regiment was raised in August 1914, and assigned to the 4th Light Horse Brigade. The regiment fought against the forces of the Ottoman Empire, in Egypt, at Gallipoli, on the Sinai Peninsula, and in Palestine and Jordan. After the armistice the regiment eventually returned to Australia in March 1919. For its role in the war the regiment was awarded fourteen battle honours. During the inter-war years, the regiment was re-raised as a part-time unit based in the Darling Downs region of Queensland. It was later converted to a motor regiment during the Second World War but was disbanded in 1943 without having been deployed overseas. Formation The 11th Light Horse Regiment was raised in Queensland and South Australia, and came together in Brisbane in May 1915. Light horse regiments normally comprised twenty-five officers and 497 other ranks serving in three squadrons, each of six troops.Gullett 1941, p. 54. Each troop was divided into eight sections, of four men each. In action one man of each section, was nominated as a horse holder reducing the regiment's rifle strength by a quarter.Horner and Williams, Chapter: Setting up the Light Horse Once formed the regiment was assigned to the 4th Light Horse Brigade. All Australian Light Horse regiments used cavalry unit designations, but were mounted infantry,Gullett 1941, p. 29. and mounted exclusively on the Australian Waler horse.Gullet 1941, p. 38. Operational history Aden The 11th Light Horse Regiment divided into two contingents sailed for the Middle East in June 1915. The first group were diverted to Aden to assist the small British garrison against an expected assault from Ottoman forces. The attack did not materialise and the regiment's contingent re-embarked in July 1915, never having seen any action. Gallipoli campaign When the Australian infantry units were dispatched to Gallipoli, it was thought the terrain was unsuitable for mounted troops, and the light horse regiments remained in Egypt. However, heavy casualties amongst the Australian infantry resulted in the deployment of the 4th Light Horse Brigade as reinforcements in August 1915. The 4th Light Horse Brigade was subsequently disbanded.Bou 2010, p. 145. On arrival, the regiment was split up to reinforce other light horse regiments that had landed earlier that were understrength. The regiment's A Squadron served with the 2nd Light Horse Regiment, B Squadron the 5th Light Horse Regiment, and C Squadron to the 9th Light Horse Regiment. Sinai and Palestine campaign C Squadron resting their horses en route to Beersheba When the British forces were withdrawn from Gallipoli, the 11th Light Horse Regiment was reformed in Egypt. Their first deployment was in defence of the Suez Canal in July 1916, and patrolling into the Sinai desert. In 1916, plans were made to convert the 11th Light Horse, along with the 4th and 12th Light Horse Regiments into cameleers, but this plan was not followed through.Bou 2010, p. 152. In early 1917, the 4th Light Horse Brigade was re-formed as part of the Imperial Mounted Division (later designated as the Australian Mounted Division), and the 11th Light Horse Regiment was re-assigned to the brigade, having been unattached until this time.Falls & MacMunn 1930, pp. 273‚Äì274. In April 1917, following the withdrawal of Ottoman forces, the regiment moved into Palestine. Its first battle as a regiment, was the unsuccessful second battle of Gaza, where they fought on foot. In October, during their next battle at Beersheba while the other two regiments in the brigade, the 4th and 12th Light Horse Regiments took part in a mounted charge, the 11th was providing flank protection and was too widely dispersed to take part. They did, however, with the 12th Light Horse carry out a charge on 7 November, during the Battle of Sheria. Faced with heavy Ottoman gun-fire, the regiment had to dismount to continue the attack, but were eventually forced to withdraw. When Gaza was captured in November 1917, the Ottoman forces withdrew into Palestine, and the 11th were involved in the pursuit. They then spent the early months of 1918, training and resting. The regiment then moved to the River Jordan, taking part in the raid on Es Salt in April and May. They were still on the river in July, helping to defeat heavy German and Ottoman attacks in July. In August 1918, the regiment was issued with the traditional cavalry sabre and training began in cavalry tactics, so they were ready to resume the British advance in September. Advancing along the coast, the 11th Light Horse took part in the battle of Samakh on 25 September. The regiment first charged the Ottoman defences on horseback using their sabres, then dismounted and cleared the town with their rifles and bayonets. The Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October 1918, and the war in the Middle East ended. However, the regiment had to return to Egypt, where rioting had started in March 1919. Finally, in July 1919, the regiment sailed for Australia. The war cost the regiment over 100 per cent casualties, with 95 killed and 521 wounded. Perpetuation In 1921, Australia's part-time military forces were re- organised to perpetuate the numerical designations of the AIF following its demobilisation.Grey 2008, p. 125. Through this process, the 11th Light Horse was re-raised as a Citizens Forces unit within the 1st Military District in the Darling Downs region of Queensland, drawing lineage from several previously existing units through which it could trace its history back to the 14th Australian Light Horse Regiment (Queensland Mounted Infantry), which had been formed in 1903. This unit remained in existence throughout the inter-war years, and in December 1941 it was converted into a motor regiment, adopting the designation of the \\"11th Motor Regiment (Darling Downs Light Horse)(QMI)\\". In 1943, the regiment was re-designated the \\"11th Australian Motor Regiment\\" and was gazetted as an AIF unit,Festberg 1972, p. 46. meaning that it could be deployed outside of Australian territory to fight if necessary.Grey 2008, p. 183. Nevertheless, as part of a gradual demobilisation of the Australian Army the regiment was deemed surplus to requirements and on 3 July 1943 it was disbanded without having seen operational service during the war; its personnel were re-allocated to the 2/10th Infantry Battalion as reinforcements.Finlayson 2012, p. 203. The regiment was part of the 1st Cavalry Brigade and then later, the 1st Motor Brigade when the cavalry units were reorganised.

Route description From the south, LA 181 begins at an intersection with LA 115 at a point known as Lone Pine in northern Evangeline Parish. LA 115 heads east toward Bunkie and south toward St. Landry. From this intersection, LA 181 proceeds north along Cheneyville Road. later, after curving to the northeast, LA 181 crosses into Rapides Parish. across the parish line, LA 181 passes through an interchange with I-49, which connects to Alexandria on the north and Opelousas on the south. LA 181 continues northeast for another , where it enters the town of Cheneyville on Greenwood Avenue. Immediately after crossing the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) tracks, the route ends at an intersection with US 71 (Front Street). US 71 parallels I-49 northward toward Alexandria and heads southeast toward Baton Rouge. The route is classified as a rural minor collector by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD) with an average daily traffic volume of 620 in 2013. It has a posted speed limit of , reduced to entering Cheneyville and as it approaches US 71. LA 181 is an undivided two- lane highway for the majority of its route, widening briefly to a divided four-lane highway through the interchange with I-49. History In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 181 made up the northern portion of State Route 271. Route 271 was designated in 1928 by an act of the state legislature. It roughly followed the present route of LA 115 from LA 106 west of St. Landry northward along Bayou Cocodrie to Lone Pine. From there, it continued along the present route of LA 181 to US 71 in Cheneyville. Here, it made a jog southeast onto US 71 then north through town across Bayou Boeuf, ending at Bayou Road. The route was originally projected to continue northward to Echo, but no such roadway was built in the pre-1955 system. LA 181 was created with the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering following the portion of former Route 271 from Lone Pine to Cheneyville. Its route has remained the same to the present day. Future La DOTD is currently engaged in a program that aims to transfer about of state- owned roadways to local governments over the next several years. Under this plan of \\"right-sizing\\" the state highway system, the entire route of LA 181 is proposed for deletion as it does not meet a significant interurban travel function.

Originally he was an Eastern Orthodox deacon, but converted in 1860 to Catholic Church. In 1865, he became Administrator of the Bulgarian Byzantine Catholic Church in the Ottoman Empire and was ordained as bishop.Catholic Hierarchy: Bishop Rafail Popov Biography Raphael Popov was born on 15 November 1830 in Strelcha, to an Eastern Orthodox family. In the period from 1849 to 1851 he was a teacher in the village of Popintsi and from 1851 he taught in Plovdiv, and in the next year, in the village of Poibrene. On August 24, 1854 he took monastic orders in Karlukovo monastery near Pleven. He taught for three years in Berkovitsa. In early January 1859 he went to the Rila Monastery and accepted the offer of Avksentii Veleshki to be ordained a deacon. In December the same year both arrived in Constantinople. On April 3, 1860 he served with Ilarion during the Easter action, when Bulgarians rejected the name of the Greek Patriarch of Constantinople. On December 30, 1860 Popov joined the Catholic Church. He participated in the Bulgarian Uniates delegation to the Pope Pius IX in the spring of 1861, when Joseph Sokolsky was ordained Bulgarian Byzantine-Catholic Archbishop. After the detachment of Joseph Sokolsky for Russia in summer 1861, Raphael Popov remained one of the main leaders of Catholic Bulgarians of Byzantine Rite in Ottoman Empire. He was ordained priest in August 1861 and became Archimandrite in 1862. Since it was probable that Joseph Sokolsky will not be returning from Russia, Rafael Popov was elected by local community in 1863 and recognized as \\"vicar and popular leader of the Bulgarians united with the Roman Catholic Church\\" by the Ottoman authorities on February 10, 1864. Soon after that, on March 28, 1865 Rafael Popov was appointed Apostolic Administrator of the Bulgarian Byzantine-Catholic Church and its vicariate in Constantinople. On November 19, 1865 he was ordained a bishop in the cathedral church \\"St. John Chrysostom\\" in Constantinople.Catholic Hierarchy: Diocese of Bulgarian United Church At the beginning of next year, he settled in Edirne. As a bishop he developed vigorous activity. Two years later, due to the great need of priests he ordained his brother a priest and sent him to take care of the parish in Pokrovan. In April 1866 Rafail Popov undertook an extensive tour in Macedonia and Thrace. In 1869-1870 he undertook a journey to Rome to take part in meetings of the First Vatican Council, which proclaimed papal infallibility in matters of faith. Rafail Popov served as bishop and administrator of Bulgarian Catholic Apostolic Vicariate for 11 years. His successful mission among Catholic Bulgarians of the Byzantine Rite worried opponents of the Bulgarian national revival. He died on March 6, 1876 and was buried in the side altar of Edirne Eastern Catholic Episcopal cathedral \\"St. Elias\\", where he served during his lifetime. He was succeeded by bishop Nil Izvorov.

Biography He was born in Kings Lynn, Norfolk, the eldest son of William Goodwin, who was a carpenter. He was trained as an architect by J. Coxedge in Kensington, London. In 1806 he exhibited a view of a chapel in Kings Lynn at the Royal Academy. He married twice, in 1808 to Mary Stort, and in 1818 to Elizabeth Reynolds. From the marriages he had at least five sons. Goodwin started his architectural career with work on two churches in Kings Lynn, His big opportunity came with the passing of the Church Building Act of 1818 which granted ¬£1 million (equivalent to ¬£ million in ) for the building of what became known as Commissioners' churches. Nine of the churches he designed for the commissioners were accepted and completed. He designed new churches for other clients, and also rebuilt or remodelled churches. Goodwin received commissions for civic buildings, in particular town halls for Manchester and Macclesfield, markets for Leeds and Salford, and for Derby Gaol. Most of the designs for churches were in Gothic Revival style, while those for the civic buildings were mainly Neoclassical. Later in his career he became involved with domestic architecture, in particular in designing Lissadell House in County Sligo, Ireland, for Sir Robert Gore-Booth. In 1833 Goodwin self- published his work entitled Domestic Architecture, being a Series of Designs for Mansions, Villas, Rectory Houses, Parsonage Houses, Bailiffs‚Äô Lodge, Gardener‚Äôs Lodge, Game-keeper‚Äôs Lodge, Park Gate Lodge etc. in the Grecian, Italian and Old English style of Architecture with Observations on the Appropriate Choice of Site; the Whole Designed with Strict Reference to the Practicability of Erection, And with Due Attention to the Important Consideration of Uniting Elegance, Convenience and Domestic Comfort with Economy; the Whole Being the Result of Upwards of Thirty Years Professional Experience with Accurate Estimates Appended to Each Design. In 1830 Goodwin prepared and published a Classical design for a ‚ÄòGrand National Cemetery‚Äô to be laid out probably at Primrose Hill ‚Äòintended for the prevention of the Danger and Inconvenience of Burying the Dead within the Metropolis: Proposed to be erected by a Capital of 400,000 l. [i.e. ¬£] in 16,000 shares at 25 l. each‚Äô. A copy of the prospectus is in the Guildhall Library. The Grand National Cemetery was not completed. Goodwin worked from an office near Bedford Square, London. According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography he used highly competitive measures to acquire commissions, and used employees to \\"chase commissions\\" in the Midlands and northern England using \\"the stagecoach system\\". He \\"inundated committees\\" with designs, and undercut his rivals' estimates. He also created unaccepted designs for a number of major buildings, including for King's College, Cambridge, Birmingham grammar school, and the new Houses of Parliament. Goodman died suddenly from \\"apoplexy\\" in 1835 at his home near Portman Square, London, and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

A typical dry pasta line consists of an extruder and a dryer.Hoseney, R. Carl. Principles of Cereal Science and Technology, 2nd Edition (St. Paul, MN: American Association of Cereal Chemists, Inc., 1986, 1994 and second printing 1998), P. 325-26. Modern machines are highly automated using programmable logic controllers. They are called \\"lines\\" because they contain a series of processing machines through which the dough passes. Extruder Automatic short cut dry pasta production machine built by Consolidated Macaroni Machine Corporation in the early 1930s The extruder mixes flour and water to make dough, kneads the dough and pushes it through a die to form the shape, and cuts the pasta to the correct length. Dry pasta lines typically use rectangular dies to extrude long goods pasta and round dies to extrude short goods pasta. The extruder typically uses a vacuum system in the mixing process to keep air out of the dough. Dryer The dryer dries the pasta to the correct moisture level, typically using sticks or screens to transport pasta inside the dryer depending on the length of the product. Long goods pasta such as spaghetti is hung vertically from sticks and short goods pasta such as penne is placed on long horizontal conveyors with mesh screen belts. Long goods pasta takes about 6-9 hours to dry depending on the temperature used in the drying process, and short goods pasta takes about 3-4 hours. Air circulation, heat and moisture control are critical factors to the pasta drying process. Post drying Manufacturers can store and package pasta in many ways after drying. After drying is complete, long pasta is usually stored in a section of the line called the accumulator, which holds the sticks with strands of pasta until it is further processed. The sticks are conveyed to a section called the \\"stripper\\", which removes the pasta from the stick, trims the strands to the correct length, and conveys it for further processing, such as a packaging machine. Finished short cut pasta is usually held in large storage silos until it is packaged or boxed. Each shape of pasta is stored in a separate silo.

Because of the religious nature of his subjects he was called a santero, but he did secular work too. His work was shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York with other artists of the Federal Art Project and he was feted as \\"a discovery.\\" He was the first Mexican American artist to receive national recognition. Early life Patroci√±o Barela's date of birth is unclear, but is assumed from his various accounts to have occurred between 1900 and 1904. His mother and younger sister both died early in his life, but these dates likewise are not clear. Barela did not attend school for more than a few weeks and was not able to write. He worked as a steelworker, miner, on the railway, as a farmhand, and as a unionized carpenter. In 1930, he married a widow and eventually with her had three more children (giving them seven in total). Career He found his calling as a carver of sacred objects in 1931. He repaired a figure of St Antonio and he later recounted that he knew that someone was going to make 20 dollars from his work and he was promised five. Although the five dollars never appeared, Barela realized that his work had value and he continued to make figures. He was taken on by the Works Progress Administration working with a horse and cart. His carvings were spotted and he was set to do those instead, eventually as part of the Public Works of Art Project. Because he was illiterate he was given a sheet filled with squares to which he would add a cross every day to record his work. This was in 1935 and eventually his work was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art but he had no ambition to see the eight objects chosen as part of a Federal Arts Project exhibition there. He was lauded by the museum as \\"the most dramatic discovery\\" and he was called \\"discovery of the year\\" by Time magazine. Two other exhibitions of his work in 1939 further established Barela nationally, the San Francisco Golden Gate Exposition and the American Art Today show at the New York World's Fair. He was discovered and was regarded almost immediately as a leading artist with his fluid sculptures carved from juniper wood. Barela's carvings found willing buyers but Barela was not a willing seller. He spent a great deal of time drinking and he would sell his work in small deals. He was driven to carve and he chose subjects from the Bible or imaginary subjects which usually had a spiritual nature. Death Barela died in a fire at the age of 62. His body was found in the corner of his studio after a fire overnight and it is presumed that inebriation combined with wood shavings and his own cigarette had created the fire. He was living at his studio in Ca√±on, near Taos, New Mexico still poor and illiterate but famous. His legacy is well regarded - The Taos art colony regard him as the first Mexican American artist to receive national recognition. Legacy The largest collection of his work is at the Harwood Museum of Art in Taos, part of the University of New Mexico. Another collection is on permanent exhibition at the Millicent Rogers Museum in Taos and consists of both three-dimensional carvings and a large relief- carved door. His other legacy is the family of artists including children and grandchildren, Luis and Carlos Barela, who carry on the tradition.

Flash-Gas The presence of flash-gas in the liquid lines reduces the efficiency of the refrigeration cycle.Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Technology, William Whitman. 2005 New York, Page 37. . It can also lead several expansion systems to work improperly, and increase superheating at the evaporator.HVAC Information - Troubleshooting. Flash-Gas This is normally perceived as an unwanted condition caused by dissociation between the volume of the system, and the pressures and temperatures that allow the refrigerant to be liquid. Flash-gas must not be confused with lack of condensation, but special gear such as receivers, internal heat exchangers, insulation, and refrigeration cycle optimizers may improve condensation and avoid gas in the liquid lines. Common Causes Heat absorption and pressure loss A small illustration of some of the most usual causes of the production of flash-gas.The most common causes driving the fluid to change its phase when in the liquid line are the excessive length of the pipeline, the small diameter of the pipelines, and the lack of subcooling. These create low pressure loci that may induce the fluid to begin changing its phase, especially if the pipeline is somehow exposed to heat absorption.Application Note 123, ACRP Remote Air-Cooled Condenser, Application and Placement, Ozan Tutunoglu. 2007, Page 1. If subcooling is not generous enough, the refrigerant remains in thermodynamic conditions close to saturation easing flash-gas appearance. The heat may be absorbed not only from high temperature sources, but from diverse energy sources such as friction in the pipeline. On the other hand, pressure in the liquid line may also be upset by artifacts and conditions including vertically rising pipes that reach too high; gear too small for the size of the piping; devices pumping refrigerant through the line, and several other strangling obstructions. Eventually, heat absorption and pressure losses in the liquid line modify the saturation conditions of the refrigerant in such manner that the refrigerant may boil and produce flash-gas. Quality and amount of refrigerant Refrigerant may also explain flash-gas occurrence. When a system lacks refrigerant, or has a leakage, it may exhibit flash-gas as the volume in the piping exceeds the capacity of the refrigerant to fill it as liquid. This may force the refrigerant into a phase change. On the other hand, lack of refrigerant can sometimes also produce the opposite effect: an overall increase on the subcooling (and superheating) which will depend on the size and design of the system and its piping. If the system‚Äôs refrigerant is degenerate, flash-gas may also be produced, as physical properties of the fluid change. This happens because the piping is designed for a specific refrigerant mixture that allows liquid in the liquid line, given certain thermodynamic conditions. If the refrigerant mixture changes its composition considerably, the original designs will not be adequate. Degenerated refrigerant produced by leakage, chemical decomposition or loading with gas when using a glided refrigerant; will most likely make the system perform very poorly, alter oil‚Äôs circulation or composition, and may eventually render gear inoperative. Gas production after expansion It is also common to find that refrigerant begins to evaporate immediately after the expansion valve, before arriving to the evaporator. This may also be considered as flash-gas but normally doesn‚Äôt produce complications in the refrigeration cycle. Many refrigeration systems have the expansion valve set up inside the room being cooled, consequently generating productive refrigeration if absorbing heat from the room, to produce this kind of flash-gas between the expansion and the evaporator. Besides, the expansion valve deregulates its operation if the fluid arriving to it is boiling. In this case, the boiling occurs after the expansion. Detection Flash-gas may be detected in the system by the observation of bubbles or gas presence in the liquid line, or the foamy aspect of the fluid. Depending on the location of the glass: this may also indicate an overwhelmed condenser, and the nonobservance of these at the glass isn‚Äôt definite of the nonoccurrence of flash-gas in the liquid line. Considering the saturation table for the refrigerant, if it is possible to confirm that a certain amount of condenser subcooling is being produced, and the glass still exhibits gas in the liquid line, one may identify this with flash-gas being produced between the condenser and the glass. The flash-gas phenomena may create a deceiving temperature drop on the liquid line that can be misinterpreted as subcooling. This is due to the fact that the refrigerant may use part of the heat obtained from lowering its temperature, to finish vaporizing itself to be able to occupy the volume of the pipes at those pressures. Prevention Efforts to prevent flash-gas in the liquid line include a cautious design of the cooling system and its piping, but also the incorporation of gear that might help solve this type of difficulty. The inclusion of a refrigerant receiver is a common, cheap and simple way of decreasing the gas ratio in the liquid line. The incorporation of a subcooling stage after the receiver reduces even more the chances to observe flash gas.Holdover Plates, Transport Refrigeration Systems. 2009 Hercules Manufacturing Company, Henderson, KY, Page 12. This subcooling may be done in a reserved portion of the main condenser, or separately with a heat exchanger. Some receivers may incorporate an internal heat exchanger that draws heat form the subcooled liquid to superheat the gas compressors suction. There are also many kinds of independent subcooling displays and applications such as refrigeration cycle optimizers; these help avoiding flash-gas in the liquid line by lowering the temperature away from the refrigerant‚Äôs saturation curves. Some systems deal with flash-gas by separating it from the refrigerant that goes to the evaporator, as that portion of the refrigerant already evaporated and will only increase superheating.SWEP, Refrigeration Systems. Two Stages One key feature when preventing flash-gas is the diameter of the piping. If the pipes are too thin and long, loss of pressure and friction tend to occur. If the evaporator is too high above the receiver, the rising pipes produce a small amount of vacuum at the topmost portion, making the fluid to undergo ebullition and produce flash-gas. On the contrary, a refrigerant column that creates weight and pressure may reduce the chances of finding flash-gas. If the evaporator is a plate exchanger placed below the level of the receiver, the pressure will not allow the refrigerant to boil easily. Insulating the liquid line can be helpful if one can determine that heat is being absorbed throughout the piping. On the contrary, if the liquid in the liquid line is hotter than the air outside, insulating the pipes on that section might increase flash-gas as natural subcooling is partially decreased. Effects on the rest of the system When preventing flash gas, one must take into account all the other features of the system and how they are affected. Increasing the pipeline diameter may have incidence on the oil circulation and affect the gas compressor. A column of refrigerant creating weight pressure in the liquid line can be a solution for flash-gas, but may have incidence in the expansion and evaporation. If the evaporator floods and liquid arrives to the gas compressor, serious complications will show up, most likely destroying the compressor (especially if the compressor is below the level of the receiver). Effects of Flash-Gas The main effect of the presence flash-gas in the liquid piping is the net loss of refrigeration capacity. In general terms this is produced in two ways. First, the expansion valve usually doesn‚Äôt work properly if injecting a gas-liquid mixture such as refrigerant with flash-gas presence. Second, a portion of the heat required for the refrigerant to flash into gaseous form is drawn from mechanical work such as pressure imbued by the gas compressor that moves the refrigerant. Both, lack of evaporation, and untimed transformations of energy from work to heat: increase the pressures and temperatures along the pipes; decrease the thermodynamic reversibility of the process, and raise the overall magnitude of entropy produced throughout the whole cycle. This means the refrigeration efficiency of the cycle worsens as it moves away from Carnot‚Äôs theoretical ideal efficiency. A loss of performance implies that the system uses more energy to produce less refrigeration. Besides, these kinds of efficiency losses not only underutilize gear, but may end up lowering the operative life of the main components, especially the expansion valve and the gas compressor.

Biography He was born in Bansko to Dimitar Poparabadzhiev, a Bulgarian Exarchate priest and a teacher. Dimitar wrote for the newspaper Bulgaria and corresponded with Dragan Tsankov, who would become the first Liberal Prime Minister of the country. Lazar's sister, Mila Dimitrova, was a member of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO). Mladenov attended a French Catholic school in Thessaloniki, graduated from highschool in Turin and attended the French college in Constantinople. After his spiritual education in Paris, he was ordained by the Archbishop of Paris. In June 1878, he was part of the French delegation to the Congress of Berlin. Later that year, he was sent to teach at the St. Benedict college in Constantinople, preferred a priestly vocation and began to serve in Thessaloniki. During the administrative reorganization of the Catholic Church in Bulgaria in 1883, he was appointed Apostolic Vicariate for Catholic Bulgarians in Macedonia on June 12, 1883, and was consecrated by archbishop Nil Izvorov in Constantinople. In early 1884, he was invited to a personal meeting with Pope Leo XIII in Rome, who confirmed the appointment of the young bishop of Apostolic Vicariate for Catholic Bulgarians in Macedonia, based in Thessaloniki. During his episcopal ministry in the late 1880s, the Uniat in Macedonia reached its apogee. Thanks to his energy and the financial backing he received from the Church, Mladenov was able to provide several initiatives with grants, found several schools in his diocese and started working on a highschool in Kilkis, which he wasn't able to finish. In 1890, his initiatives paved the way for the founding of the Bulgarian Catholic cathedral as his bishop's seat. In 1894, financial scandals and affairs caused conflicts between several Catholic factions, and eventually led to his departure from the Episcopal department at the end of October 1894.Kirche im Osten, V. 24/1981, S. 203 In early December 1894, Lazar Mladenov asked the Holy Synod in Sofia to be accepted into the Eastern Orthodox Church.

Occupying the historic FirstEnergy Powerhouse building located on the west bank of the Cuyahoga River in the city's Flats district, the aquarium, which opened in January 2012, consists of approximately of exhibition space and features 55 exhibits over 9 thematic concentrations representing both local and exotic species of fish. The facility is the only independent, free- standing aquarium in the state of Ohio and ended a 26-year period that the city lacked a public aquarium. History A former Cleveland Aquarium opened on February 6, 1954, and was located on the city's near-east side in Gordon Park. It was created by the Cleveland Aquarium Society, a group formed in the 1940s, the City of Cleveland and the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, which operated the facility. The aquarium was housed in a building constructed in the 1930s that previously served as bath house. In 1943, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History converted it into a trailside museum, displaying local flora and fauna as well as exhibits of freshwater fish of Lake Erie. That museum closed in 1953 when the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway cut Gordon Park in two. In the early 1950s, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, which had previously had aquatic exhibits on its second floor of former home, moved to its own new building and consolidated its aquatic collection into the Cleveland Aquarium. The old Gordon Park trailside museum was renovated by Cleveland Aquarium Society volunteers for about $25,000. The aquarium had 50 freshwater and marine exhibits including sharks, sawfish, seahorses, eels, squid, octopus, and coral. It acquired a pair of Australian lungfish in 1966 and a school of red-bellied piranhas in 1970. Under the Natural History Museum's direction, the aquarium often drew more visitors than the building could handle. A $300,000 gift from the Leonard C. Hanna Foundation financed the construction of a new octagonal wing in 1967 that tripled the aquarium's size and increased its tank capacity from . Despite annual deficits experienced during the decade, a city council override of a mayoral veto to increase the admission charges and keep aquarium operations with the museum was performed in 1979. Structural problems with the building forced the closing of the aquarium to the public in June 1985. The former aquarium site then became a police dog training facility for the City of Cleveland. On April 1, 1986, fish and exhibits were moved to the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, where they remain today in the Primate, Cat & Aquatics Building. A New Aquarium in Cleveland A new aquarium was conceived in 2009. It was originally envisioned as a more ambitious facility that would cost more than $50 million. However, planning of various forms occurred since the defunct Cleveland Aquarium closed in 1985. Although there were competing interests, the driving force behind the project was Jeffrey Jacobs, a local developer who envisioned it as being part of the Powerhouse, a complex he owned. The eventual facility was a collaboration. It was financed by a $2 million loan from the City of Cleveland, a $1.25 million investment from Marinescape, and an $11.75 million investment from the Nautica Phase 2 Limited Partnership, an affiliate of Jacobs Entertainment. The facility also supported by FirstEnergy and AMPCO, the parking lot operator for the Nautica Complex. A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held for the aquarium January 19, 2012, with the aquarium opening to the general public on January 21. Jacobs Entertainment purchased the aquarium outright in 2014. Facility The total cost of the facility was roughly $33 million: $18 million for the building and its related infrastructure and $15 million for aquarium exhibits. At the January 2012 opening, the aquarium 8 exhibition areas, including Ohio Lakes & Rivers, Lakes & Rivers of the World, Discovery Zone, Indo-Pacific, Northern Pacific, Coastal, Coral Reef and a main Shark SeaTube. It features a tank with a acrylic shark tunnel offering panoramic views of marine life, including sharks of various species. In 2018, the Greater Cleveland Aquarium announced plans to upgrade much of its public space using internal resources and many upcycled materials. In addition to upgrading animal life support systems, the Aquarium enhanced gallery theming, welcomed more than a dozen new species including weedy seadragons and splitfin flashlight fish, and expanded its annual passholder program. Approximately 75% of the Aquarium‚Äôs public spaces were part of the capital project. In the transformation, the Aquarium divided Lakes & Rivers of the World into two galleries‚ÄîAsia & Indonesia Gallery and Tropical Forest Gallery; created an Industry & Habitat Gallery to highlight the positive (biomimicry) and negative (habitat loss, pollution) intersections of nature and industry; added relevant conservation action opportunities in each gallery; created Imagiquarium, a toddler-friendly pretend-and-playspace; and expanded its Invasive Species Hut. Experiences  In addition to a calendar of special events including Hauntaquarium, Fin Fest and Scuba Claus, the Greater Cleveland Aquarium offers daily interactive experiences including aquarist talks, animal encounters, SCUBA diver underwater talks and exhibit feedings. The aquarium also offers SCUBA-certified divers the opportunity to dive in its Shark Gallery through its Shark Dive CLE program. Conservation Activities  In 2012, Greater Cleveland Aquarium General Manager Tami Brown established a non-profit Splash Fund ‚Äúto educate and encourage passion about aquatic life and participation in the conservation of fresh and saltwater habitats through sustainable human practices.‚Äù In 2019, Splash Fund Board Members include new General Manager Stephanie White, Deborah Altman, Bruce Akers, Richard Dorman, Scot Rourke and Trevor Gile. Monies raised by this nonprofit fund have been used to conduct regular community Adopt-A-Beach cleanups at Edgewater Park, provide schools with demonstrated need access to life science-based educational programs and works to encourage a more robust Northeast Ohio spotted turtle population. The Splash Fund is one of more than a dozen partners dedicated to the Saving and Protecting Ohio Turtle Diversity (SPOTD) program working to boost the native but threatened spotted turtle population in Northeast Ohio.

It roughly states that any element dominated by a positive element in a Riesz space with the principal projection property can in a sense be approximated uniformly by simple functions. Numerous well-known results may be derived from the Freudenthal spectral theorem. The well-known Radon‚ÄìNikodym theorem, the validity of the Poisson formula and the spectral theorem from the theory of normal operators can all be shown to follow as special cases of the Freudenthal spectral theorem.

In IRSp53, a ubiquitous regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, the IMD domain acts as conserved F-actin bundling domain involved in filopodium formation. Filopodium-inducing IMD activity is regulated by Cdc42 and Rac1 (Rho-family GTPases) and is SH3-independent. The IRSp53/MIM family is a novel F-actin bundling protein family that includes invertebrate relatives: * Vertebrate MIM (missing in metastasis) (MTSS1), an actin-binding scaffold protein that may be involved in cancer metastasis. * Vertebrate ABBA-1 (MTSS1L), a MIM-related protein. *Vertebrate brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2 (BAI1-associated protein 2) or insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53), a multifunctional adaptor protein that links Rac1 with a Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2/WASF2) to induce lamellipodia or Cdc42 with Mena to induce filopodia. * Vertebrate brain-specific angiogenesis nhibitor 1-associated protein 2-like proteins 1 and 2 (BAI1-associated protein 2-like proteins 1 and 2, BAIAP2L1 and BAIAP2L2). * Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly) CG32082-PA. * Caenorhabditis elegans M04F3.5 protein. The vertebrate IRSp53/MIM family is divided into two major groups: the IRSp53 subfamily and the MIM/ABBA subfamily. The putative invertebrate homologues are positioned between them. The IRSp53 subfamily members contain an SH3 domain, and the MIM/ABBA subfamily proteins contain a WH2 (WASP-homology 2) domain. The vertebrate SH3-containing subfamily is further divided into three groups according to the presence or absence of the WWB and the half-CRIB motif. The IMD domain can bind to and bundle actin filaments, bind to membranes and interact with the small GTPase Rac. The IMD domain folds as a coiled coil of three extended alpha-helices and a shorter C-terminal helix. Helix 4 packs tightly against the other three helices, and thus represents an integral part of the domain. The fold of the IMD domain closely resembles that of the BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-RVS) domain, a functional module serving both as a sensor and inducer of membrane curvature. The IMD domain is also known as the I-BAR domain because of its inverse curvature of the membrane binding surface compared to that of the BAR domain. The WH2 domain performs a scaffolding function.

Dr. Eichwald, while studying cancer in the 1940s, described the male-specific antigen and helped establish the foundations of transplantation immunology. He organized the first International Transplantation Conference, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in Harriman, N.Y., in 1953; founded and edited the journal, Transplantation Bulletin and its successor, Transplantation, for more than 30 years; and chaired the Transplantation Committee of the National Academy of Sciences from 1955 to 1967. His research played an important role in the development of successful protocols for organ transplantation in humans. Early years Ernst Julius Eichwald was born December 13, 1913, in Hannover, Germany. He earned his medical degrees from the University of Freiburg in 1938 and from the University of Utah School of Medicine in 1953. He served briefly in the German Wehrmacht in 1938, then moved to the United States the same year to begin his pathology training, first in Covington, Kentucky, followed by Dayton, Ohio, and then in Boston, at Children's Hospital. He subsequently worked as an Assistant in Pathology at Harvard Medical School, followed by service in the U.S. Army from 1944 to 1946 as Head of Laboratory Service at the 120th General Hospital, New Guinea, Manila, Philippines, and Kyoto, Japan. Upon completing his military service, he returned to Boston as an Assistant Pathologist at Boston Children's Hospital before accepting a faculty position in Pathology at the University of Utah in 1948. Montana years He was recruited to Montana Deaconess Hospital in Great Falls, Montana in 1953 under an arrangement that provided resources to support his research program. He established the Laboratory for Experimental Medicine in 1956 that evolved into the McLaughlin Research Institute in Great Falls, an independent biomedical research institute that continues to thrive.

The Umfraville family had been an important one in the north of England for centuries, and held major estates in Yorkshire. Among his ancestors, he counted the mormaers of Angus, and more recently his family had married into that of the Percies, a powerful local marcher family, with whom Umfraville was to be closely associated. Much of Sir Robert's career continued on the same path as his ancestors, which was primarily focused on defending the border with Scotland, which was in a state of semi-permanent warfare and had been so since the late thirteenth century. Umfraville fought under three English kings. Firstly, under Richard II, he began his career, probably fighting at the Battle of Otterburn with Henry \\"Hotspur\\" Percy. After King Richard was deposed by Henry Bolingbroke in 1399, Umfraville loyally served the new Lancastrian regime as both a bulwark against Scottish incursions and at the forefront of English aggression, whichever was required. Where necessary, however, he could also play the role of an effective diplomat, taking part in many embassies to Scotland and negotiating treaties when events made them possible. With the exception of Henry V's resumption of the Hundred Years' War in 1415‚Äìwhen Umfraville travelled with the King to France and took part in the Battle of Agincourt‚Äìall his martial activity was on the Scottish border. He was famed for his prowess; one contemporary chronicler, John Hardyng, who was also in Umfraville's service, praised him as the perfect knight. Umfraville's successes also attracted praise‚Äìand some reward‚Äìfrom the King. One campaign deep into Scottish territory resulted in his destroying Peebles and its market; he brought back so much booty that he was nicknamed \\"Robin Mendmarket.\\" Umfraville, although he married, never had any children, and his closest relative‚Äìhis nephew Gilbert‚Äìpredeceased him, perishing at the Battle of Baug√© in 1421. Although Umfraville remained in royal service almost to the last months of his life, it is uncertain how financially profitable this service was; most of his lands in the north would have been prone to frequent ravishing by marauding armies, so his Midlands estates may have been his main source of income. He carried out his last mission to Scotland in March 1436 and died early the next year. Background Robert Ufraville was the youngest son of Sir Thomas Umfraville, who died in 1387, and his family had been an important one in Anglo-Scottish relations and on the border since the twelfth century, holding major estates in Northumberland and counting amongst their ancestors the Earls of Angus. They owned much land around the Redesdale area, consisting of the c. old Regality of Redesdale, although both the Scottish wars and the growth of other, newer regional families, such as the Nevilles, had led to a decline in their status by the fifteenth century. Indeed, Sir Robert himself, still a minor at his father's death, served his wardship under the first Neville Earl of Westmorland. Career The Battle of Otterburn, 1388, from a fifteenth-century depiction; this was probably one of Umfraville's earliest military campaigns. Robert Umfraville's career was predominantly a military one. The chronicler John Hardyng (who entered Umfraville's service sometime between 1402 and 1403) reports that Umfraville fought at the Battle of Otterburn in 1388, as part of the contingent of Henry Hotspur (the son of the Earl of Northumberland). This, says Hardyng, was followed by the first of many border raids Umfraville led into Scotland in 1390. These continued following the deposition of King Richard II, and he probably took part in the Battle of Homildon Hill in 1402. In fact, notwithstanding the regime change of 1399, Umfraville's duties were very much unchanged, and the \\"old truths remained: royal service, local administration and the defence of the realm.\\" He was indentured to join Henry IV's invasion of Scotland in 1400, which came to very little; Umfraville subsequently inflicted a defeat on a large Scots army at Fulhope Law after an attempted a raid. He continued in defence of the border through the next decade, and his expertise in local politics helped him advise the Warden of the Eastern March, the King's son, John, Duke of Lancaster. Umfraville probably acted in the capacity of 'sub-warden' to the duke, in the now largely defunct middle march. In 1407, with his young nephew Gilbert V de Umfraville, he attended, as a tenant‚Äìin‚Äìchief, the enthronement of the new Bishop of Durham, Thomas Langley. Umfraville's loyalty to the new regime was appreciated by King Henry IV, who retained him for life for an annuity of forty pounds. At some point he was also knighted by the King; historian Henry Summerson has said this helped \\"to ensure his loyalty against the Percys, his former lords\\" who were growing increasingly dissatisfied with Henry. This paid off for the King, for, in 1405, when Archbishop Scrope rebelled, Umfraville joined the Earl of Westmorland in suppressing the uprising at Shipton Moor. Uncommonly for a younger son in the Middle Ages, and probably another reflection of the high standing in which he stood with the King, in 1408 Umfraville was elected to the Order of the Garter, whereupon he took the stall of Edmund, Earl of Kent, who had died that year. Umfraville's association with John Hardyng came about sometime after 1402, when Hardyng's previous patron, Hotspur, was killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury, and Hardyng joined Umfraville's service after receiving a royal pardon to do so. In the 1390s that Umfraville began sitting on Royal Commissions in his home county of Northumberland and was appointed its Sheriff in 1401. Three years later, the Earl of Northumberland gave him the command of Berwick Castle, and Umfraville received the keeping of Warkworth Castle in 1405, and appointed Hardyng his Constable there. He was also granted the lordship of Langley the same year. Following the Earl of Northumberland's defeat and death at the Battle of Bramham Moor in 1408 (which Umfraville had persuaded Westmorland to undertake) and in acknowledgment of the role Sir Robert played in it, Westmorland re-appointed Umfraville to the keeping of Warkworth, while Umfraville's diplomatic work with Scotland also increased as the result of the Percies' fall. Umfraville was the only Percy retainer that King Henry IV made an effort to reconcile to the new Lancastrian regime; as a \\"border warlord with impeccable lineage.\\" Umfraville earned great rewards from the crown while still commanding the respect of what remained of the Percy affinity in the north-west. Robert Umfraville had a close relationship with his nephew Gilbert, the son of Robert's elder brother Thomas, who had died in 1391. Through Gilbert, Robert also had a permanent connection to Ralph, Earl of Westmorland, as Gilbert married Ralph's daughter Anne. Robert was probably responsible for Gilbert's martial training, as the two spent the years of the late 1400s on the border; in 1408 they jointly-led a raid into Teviotdale: Harding describes how Robert was like an \\"olde dogge [that] hath grete joy to bayte his whelpe.\\" The raids continued, with another soon after on Jedburgh. Robert's service for the King was not confined to the northern border, and neither was it confined to fighting on land. In 1410, he was appointed lieutenant to Sir Thomas Beaufort, the Admiral of the seas. In this capacity, following the burning of Roxburgh, Umfraville commanded a force of ten ships and 600 men and destroyed Scottish shipping sheltered in the Firth of Forth, capturing 13 or 14 of them. This may well have been the documented occasion on which Umfraville utilised fire ships against them. As a result of his successes, he was appointed Captain of Roxburgh in place of John Neville, the Earl of Westmorland's son. Umfraville was owed ¬£666 for his naval expedition, and two years later, Bishop Langley paid Umfraville 100 marks to repair the walls of Berwick Castle, which by this time was in some disrepair. The 'Southampton Plot,' service in France and return Part the remains of Roxburgh Castle (in 2007), the focus of so much of Umfraville's career. In 1415 he was part of the Agincourt expedition with Henry V of England, fighting at that battle and at the Siege of Harfleur. Henry confirmed him in his ¬£40 annuity at this time. However, Henry Summerson has suggested that the reason for his presence in France rather than on the border was the result of the Southampton Plot against the King. The plot had been exposed to Henry just before the expedition sailed. Umfraville had been summoned‚Äì\\"by name\\"‚Äìto the King in August 1415, due to his military importance. This summons, says Summerson, was because Henry suspected Umfraville of \\"harbouring a residual loyalty to the Percys\\" and of \\"thus of being sympathetic to the Southampton plot of 1415, whose aims included a Percy restoration.\\" In July 1411, Umfraville had been appointed Captain of Roxburgh Castle for a six-year term. However, he had been relieved of his appointment just prior to his summons to the King. Since Umfraville was indentured by the King to serve abroad in the following year's campaign, he presumably had cleared himself of suspicion in the King's eyes, and in any case, by 1417 he had returned to the Northumberland and the border. The Duke of Albany had launched a \\"foul raid\\" on the county of Northumberland‚Äìwhich broke the existing truce‚Äìagainst Berwick that year. On 3 August Umfraville (as Chamberlain of Berwick and Captain of Roxburgh) was informed that Albany intended to invade England with an army of 60,000 and besiege Berwick. E. F. Jacob has suggested that the leaders of the Southampton Plot had expected Umfraville's support, but that, in the end, if he did let the Scots over the border, it was ultimately \\"only to destroy them.\\" Sir Robert led a series of retaliatory raids against Scotland in revenge, climaxing in 1419 with his assault upon the town of Peebles. As a result of his burning of the town on market day, Umfraville earned the moniker 'mendmarket.' John Hardyng's later verse proclaimed that Umfraville, being determined that not all the glory should be earned solely by those fighting the French, \\"made the warre on Scottes to have a name\\" for himself. As Alexander Rose put it, while Henry V was \\"sacking Caen and advancing into undefended Bayeux and Lisieux... Sir Robert Umfraville, his most ruthless lieutenant [had] free rein to tear south-eastern Scotland savagely apart for two years,\\" and John Hardying commented benevolently upon Umfraville's consequent winning of prisoners and booty. Later years Sir Robert had married a woman known only as Isabella by 1419, when he is also recorded as taking membership of the Durham confraternity. He also appears to have been friends with the Prior of Durham, John Wessington (with whom he dined at Durham Priory on at least one occasion that we know of) who had not only granted him his letters of confraternity, but had been entrusted by Umfraville with important family title deeds. Umfraville had a degree of religious devotion; in 1428, he was licensed to grant his manor of Farnacres, near Newcastle upon Tyne for the use of a chantry chapel, one of the few that was free-standing. The chapel, Umfraville charged, should be devoted to the souls of himself, his wife, Kings Henry IV and V, and to each past, present and future member of the Order of the Garter. In 1421 Robert acted as his nephew's executor, following Gilbert's death in the disastrous English defeat at the Battle of Baug√©. From his nephew, Umfraville inherited the Redesdale and Kyme estates; he had already lost his lordship of Langley in 1414 when the second Earl of Northumberland was restored to his patrimony. It was with this Henry Percy that Sir Robert spent much of the remainder of his military career in the north of England (this included not only fighting but diplomatic duties‚Äìfor instance in 1425, he was sent to King James to assist the ongoing negotiations, although the results of this particular embassy is unknown). His duties also involved administrative work such as presiding over the Warden's Marcher Court, negotiating temporary truces, attending peace conferences, and travelling on embassies. He also continued to keep the peace in his home county as well, for example helping to arbitrate the dispute between the Northumberland gentry families of Heron (of Ford Castle) and Manners between 1428 and 1431, although as a feoffee to Sir William Heron‚Äìand being one of \\"the two most powerful knights in the county\\"‚ÄìSir Robert took the part of Heron's wife, Isabel, after Heron was killed by Manners. This event, said James Raine, \\"abounds with incident, characterising, at the same time, the pugnacious state of the borders, the total absence of every thing in the shape of legal redress, and the omnipotence of the church.\\" In this arbitration, Prior Wessington acted as an umpire. In Umfraville's own words, he wished to see \\"gude rest and pece to be had in the cuntre.\\" Eventually, through Wessington's and Langley's arbitration, Umfraville informed the former on 3 April 1428 that he would request Isabel's lawsuit in London be withdrawn if Manners would pay a surety of 400 marks to Heron's widow and help Umfraville redeem the Heron estates from royal custody (for which he would attempt to get the amount of compensation demanded by the widow reduced). On the 23rd of the month, Manners may have indentured himself to Umfraville's \\"lytill and esy tretye,\\" as it was termed, to pay all Heron's debts and to establish chantries for those that died during the course of their dispute. A tripartite Indenture was eventually agreed and delivered at Newcastle on 24 May 1431, which Umfraville attended, and at which he received the first instalment of the 250 marks compensation he‚Äìand Heron's widow‚Äìwere now due from John Manners. Since Gilbert had been his closest relative, and Robert and Isabelle had had no children, his estates passed to a distant relative, Sir William Tailboys. How much these lands were actually worth, however, Summerson has queried: although his manors around Redesdale covered over , Scotland and England were in a state of war, and he suggests it is likely that these estates had been greatly ravaged. Possibly the only lands of Umfraville's that were worth their full value at the time, Summerson says, were those in Lincolnshire, which could have been worth up to ¬£400 per annum. Death and contemporary perception Historian Chris Given-Wilson has described Umfraville as one of \\"the most renowned warriors of their day.\\" This reflects the contemporary view of Robert Umfraville as something of a fifteenth-century hero: in 1426 the King's Council, on behalf of the then four-year old King Henry VI, had written to him, thanking him for his \\"great and notable services‚Ä¶ to your most renowned honour and praise and to the advantage of us and our whole realm,\\" whilst John Hardyng called Umfraville \\"a Jewell for a kynge, in wyse consayle and knyghtly dede of werre\\" as well as a \\"vision of the ideal knight... brave and wise in war, generous and loyal to his followers, a lover of justice and protector of the common good.\\" Sir Robert received his last commission to organise a truce with Scotland in March 1436 and died on 27 January the following year. He was buried in Newminster Abbey, where his wife, who died less than two years later in 1438, was buried beside him.

This has included the use of biological agents (microbes and plants) as well as the biotoxins, including venoms, derived from them. Before the 20th century, the use of biological agents took three major forms: * Deliberate contamination of food and water with poisonous or contagious material * Use of microbes, biological toxins, animals, or plants (living or dead) in a weapon system * Use of biologically inoculated fabrics and persons In the 20th century, sophisticated bacteriological and virological techniques allowed the production of significant stockpiles of weaponized bio-agents: *Bacterial agents: Anthrax, Brucella, Tularemia, etc. *Viral agents: Smallpox, Viral hemorrhagic fevers, etc. *Toxins: Botulinum, Ricin, etc. Antiquity The earliest documented incident of the intention to use biological weapons is possibly recorded in Hittite texts of 1500‚Äì1200 BCE, in which victims of tularemia were driven into enemy lands, causing an epidemic. Although the Assyrians knew of ergot, a parasitic fungus of rye which produces ergotism when ingested, there is no evidence that they poisoned enemy wells with the fungus, as has been claimed. According to Homer's epic poems about the legendary Trojan War, the Iliad and the Odyssey, spears and arrows were tipped with poison. During the First Sacred War in Greece, in about 590 BCE, Athens and the Amphictionic League poisoned the water supply of the besieged town of Kirrha (near Delphi) with the toxic plant hellebore.Mayor, Andrienne (2003), Greek Fire, Poison Arrows, and Scorpion Bombs: Biological and Chemical Warfare in the Ancient World, The Overlook Press, Peter Mayer Publishers, Inc., , pp 100‚Äì101 According to Herodotus, during the 4th century BC Scythian archers dipped their arrow tips into decomposing cadavers of humans and snakes or in blood mixed with manure, supposedly making them contaminated with dangerous bacterial agents like Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium tetani, and snake venom. In a naval battle against King Eumenes of Pergamon in 184 BC, Hannibal of Carthage had clay pots filled with venomous snakes and instructed his sailors to throw them onto the decks of enemy ships.Rothschild J.H. (1964), Tomorrow‚Äôs Weapons: Chemical and Biological, New York, New York: McGraw-Hill. The Roman commander Manius Aquillius poisoned the wells of besieged enemy cities in about 130 BC. In about AD 198, the Parthian city of Hatra (near Mosul, Iraq) repulsed the Roman army led by Septimius Severus by hurling clay pots filled with live scorpions at them.Cornelius Nepos, Hannibal 11.5‚Äì6. Herodian 3.9.3‚Äì8 and Dio Cassius 68.31‚Äì75 and Epitome 75.10 and 76.10. Like Scythian archers, Roman soldiers dipped their swords into excrements and cadavers too ‚Äî victims were commonly infected by tetanus as result. There are numerous other instances of the use of plant toxins, venoms, and other poisonous substances to create biological weapons in antiquity. Post- Classical Ages The Mongol Empire established commercial and political connections between the Eastern and Western areas of the world, through the most mobile army ever seen. The armies, composed of the most rapidly moving travelers who had ever moved between the steppes of East Asia (where bubonic plague was and remains endemic among small rodents), managed to keep the chain of infection without a break until they reached, and infected, peoples and rodents who had never encountered it. The ensuing Black Death may have killed up to 25 million total, including China and roughly a third of the population of Europe and in the next decades, changing the course of Asian and European history. Biologicals were extensively used in many parts of Africa from the sixteenth century AD, most of the time in the form of poisoned arrows, or powder spread on the war front as well as poisoning of horses and water supply of the enemy forces. In Borgu, there were specific mixtures to kill, hypnotize, make the enemy bold, and to act as an antidote against the poison of the enemy as well. The creation of biologicals was reserved for a specific and professional class of medicine-men. In South Sudan, the people of the Koalit Hills kept their country free of Arab invasions by using tsetse flies as a weapon of war. Several accounts can give an idea of the efficiency of the biologicals. For example, Mockley-Ferryman in 1892 commented on the Dahomean invasion of Borgu, stating that \\"their (Borgawa) poisoned arrows enabled them to hold their own with the forces of Dahomey notwithstanding the latter's muskets.\\" The same scenario happened to Portuguese raiders in Senegambia when they were defeated by Mali's Gambian forces, and to John Hawkins in Sierra Leone where he lost a number of his men to poisoned arrows. During the Middle Ages, victims of the bubonic plague were used for biological attacks, often by flinging fomites such as infected corpses and excrement over castle walls using catapults. Bodies would be tied along with canon balls and shot towards the city area. In 1346, during the siege of Caffa (now Feodossia, Crimea) the attacking Tartar Forces (subjugated by the Mongol empire under Genghis Khan more than a century ago), used the bodies of Mongol warriors of the Golden Horde who had died of plague, as weapons. An outbreak of plague followed and the defending forces retreated, followed by the conquest of the city by the Mongols. It has been speculated that this operation may have been responsible for the advent of the Black Death in Europe. At the time, the attackers thought that the stench was enough to kill them, though it was the disease that was deadly. At the siege of Thun-l'√âv√™que in 1340, during the Hundred Years' War, the attackers catapulted decomposing animals into the besieged area. In 1422, during the siege of Karlstein Castle in Bohemia, Hussite attackers used catapults to throw dead (but not plague-infected) bodies and 2000 carriage-loads of dung over the walls. English Longbowmen usually did not draw their arrows from a quiver; rather, they stuck their arrows into the ground in front of them. This allowed them to nock the arrows faster and the dirt and soil was likely to stick to the arrowheads, thus making the wounds much more likely to become infected. 17th and 18th century Europe The last known incident of using plague corpses for biological warfare occurred in 1710, when Russian forces attacked the Swedes by flinging plague- infected corpses over the city walls of Reval (Tallinn). However, during the 1785 siege of La Calle, Tunisian forces flung diseased clothing into the city. North America The British Army attempted use of smallpox against Native Americans during the Siege of Fort Pitt in June 1763. During a parley in midst of the siege on June 24, 1763, Captain Simeon Ecuyer gave representatives of the besieging Delawares two blankets and a handkerchief enclosed in small metal boxes that had been exposed to smallpox, in an attempt to spread the disease to the Natives in order to end the siege.Anderson, Crucible of War, 541‚Äì42; Jennings, Empire of Fortune, 447n26. William Trent, the trader turned militia commander who had come up with the plan, sent a bill to the British Army indicating that the purpose of giving the blankets was \\"to Convey the Smallpox to the Indians.\\" The invoice's approval confirms that the British command endorsed Trent's actions. A reported outbreak that began the spring before left as many as one hundred Native Americans dead in Ohio Country from 1763 to 1764. It is not clear, however, whether the smallpox was a result of the Fort Pitt incident or the virus was already present among the Delaware people as outbreaks happened on their own every dozen or so years and the delegates were met again later and they seemingly hadn't contracted smallpox. Trade and combat also provided ample opportunity for transmission of the disease. A month later British commander Lord Jeffery Amherst and Swiss- British officer Colonel Henry Bouquet discussed the topic of using blankets to spread smallpox amongst Natives. Four letters are cited from June 29, July 13, 16 and 26th, 1763. Excerpts: Amherst wrote on July 16, 1763, \\"P.S. You will Do well to try to Inocculate the Indians by means of Blankets, as well as to try Every other method that can serve to Extirpate this Execrable Race. I should be very glad your Scheme for Hunting them Down by Dogs could take Effect,...\\" Bouquet replied on July 26, 1763, \\"I received yesterday your Excellency's letters of 16th with their Inclosures. The signal for Indian Messengers, and all your directions will be observed.\\" Smallpox was highly contagious among the Native Americans, and ‚Äî together with measles, influenza, chicken pox, and other Old World diseases ‚Äî was a major cause of death since the arrival of Europeans and their animals.Crawford, Native Americans of the Pontiac's War, 245‚Äì250 New South Wales Australian aborigines (Kooris) have always maintained that the British deliberately spread smallpox in 1789,Foley, Dennis, ‚Äò‚Äô Repossession of our Spirit: Traditional Owners of Northern Sydney,‚Äô‚Äô (2001). Also Davis, Jack, in ‚Äò‚ÄôAborigines of the West: Their Past and Their Present‚Äô‚Äô ed. Berndt, RM and CH (1980), UWA Press, Perth. but this possibility has only been raised by historians from the 1980s when Dr Noel Butlin suggested; ‚Äúthere are some possibilities that ... disease could have been used deliberately as an exterminating agent‚Äù.Butlin, Noel, Our Original Aggression: Aboriginal Populations of Southeastern Australia 1788‚Äì1850 (1983), Allen & Unwin, Syd. In 1997, David Day claimed there ‚Äúremains considerable circumstantial evidence to suggest that officers other than Phillip, or perhaps convicts or soldiers ‚Ä¶ deliberately spread smallpox among aborigines‚ÄùDay, David, Claiming a Continent: a new history of Australia (1996), Angus & Robertson, Sydney, p63f. and in 2000 Dr John Lambert argued that ‚Äústrong circumstantial evidence suggests the smallpox epidemic which ravaged Aborigines in 1789, may have resulted from deliberate infection‚Äù.Lambert, JT., ‚Äò‚ÄôBrokers of Cultural Change‚Äô‚Äô (2000), , p245. Judy Campbell argued in 2002 that it is highly improbable that the First Fleet was the source of the epidemic as \\"smallpox had not occurred in any members of the First Fleet\\"; the only possible source of infection from the Fleet being exposure to variolous matter imported for the purposes of inoculation against smallpox. Campbell argued that, while there has been considerable speculation about a hypothetical exposure to the First Fleet's variolous matter, there was no evidence that Aboriginal people were ever actually exposed to it. She pointed to regular contact between fishing fleets from the Indonesia archipelago, where smallpox was always present, and Aboriginal people in Australia's North as a more likely source for the introduction of smallpox. She notes that while these fishermen are generally referred to as ‚ÄòMacassans‚Äô, referring to the port of Macassar on the island of Sulawesi from which most of the fishermen originated, ‚Äúsome travelled from islands as distant as New Guinea‚Äù. She noted that there is little disagreement that the smallpox epidemic of the 1860s was contracted from Macassan fishermen and spread through the Aboriginal population by Aborigines fleeing outbreaks and also via their traditional social, kinship and trading networks. She argued that the 1789‚Äì90 epidemic followed the same pattern.Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780 ‚Äì 1880, by Judy Campbell, Melbourne University Press, 2002, Foreword & pp 55, 61, 73‚Äì74, 181 These claims are controversial as it is argued that any smallpox virus brought to New South Wales probably would have been sterilised by heat and humidity encountered during the voyage of the First Fleet from England and incapable of biological warfare. However, in 2007, Christopher Warren demonstrated that the British smallpox may have been still viable. Since then some scholars have argued that the British committed biological warfare in 1789 near their new convict settlement at Port Jackson. In 2013 Warren reviewed the issue and argued that smallpox did not spread across Australia before 1824 and showed that there was no smallpox at Macassar that could have caused the outbreak at Sydney. Warren, however, did not address the issue of persons who joined the Macassan fleet from other islands and from parts of Sulawesi other than the port of Macassar. Warren concluded that the British were \\"the most likely candidates to have released smallpox\\" near Sydney Cove in 1789. Warren proposed that the British had no choice as they were confronted with dire circumstances when, among other factors, they ran out of ammunition for their muskets. Warren also uses native oral tradition and the archaeology of native graves to analyse the cause and effect of the spread of smallpox in 1789. Prior to the publication of Warren's article (2013), a professor of physiology John Carmody argued that the epidemic was an outbreak of chickenpox which took a drastic toll on an Aboriginal population without immunological resistance.For more detailed discussion of the chickenpox theory, as developed by Drs Carmody and G E Ford, and by the archaeologist Barry Wright, see Wikipedia's article on The History Wars. With regard to how smallpox might have reached the Sydney region, Dr Carmody said: \\"There is absolutely no evidence to support any of the theories and some of them are fanciful and far- fetched..\\" Warren argued against the chickenpox theory at endnote 3 of Smallpox at Sydney Cove ‚Äì Who, When, Why?.Journal of Australian Studies http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14443058.2013.849750#preview However, in a 2014 joint paper on historic Aboriginal demography, Carmody and the Australian National University's Boyd Hunter argued that the recorded behavior of the epidemic ruled out smallpox and indicated chickenpox.\\"Towards more consistent estimates of Aboriginal de-population in the early colonial Australia\\" by Jack Carmody and Boyd Hunter, presented to Asia-Pacific Economic & Business History conference in Hamilton (University of Waikato) 13‚Äì15 February 2014.

Jack London, in his short story '\\"Yah! Yah! Yah!\\"' (1909), described a punitive European expedition to a South Pacific island deliberately exposing the Polynesian population to measles, of which many of them died. London wrote another science fiction tale the following year, \\"The Unparalleled Invasion\\" (1910), in which the Western nations wipe out all of China with a biological attack. First World War During the First World War (1914‚Äì1918), the Empire of Germany made some early attempts at anti- agriculture biological warfare. Those attempts were made by special sabotage group headed by Rudolf Nadolny. Using diplomatic pouches and couriers, the German General Staff supplied small teams of saboteurs in the Russian Duchy of Finland, and in the then-neutral countries of Romania, the United States, and Argentina. In Finland, saboteurs mounted on reindeer placed ampoules of anthrax in stables of Russian horses in 1916.http://www.geocities.ws/jamie_bisher/anthrax.htm Anthrax was also supplied to the German military attach√© in Bucharest, as was glanders, which was employed against livestock destined for Allied service. German intelligence officer and US citizen Dr. Anton Casimir Dilger established a secret lab in the basement of his sister's home in Chevy Chase, Maryland, that produced glanders which was used to infect livestock in ports and inland collection points including, at least, Newport News, Norfolk, Baltimore, and New York City, and probably St. Louis and Covington, Kentucky. In Argentina, German agents also employed glanders in the port of Buenos Aires and also tried to ruin wheat harvests with a destructive fungus. Also, Germany itself became a victim of similar attacks ‚Äî horses bound for Germany were infected with Burkholderia by French operatives in Switzerland. The Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibited the use of chemical weapons and biological weapons, but said nothing about experimentation, production, storage, or transfer; later treaties did cover these aspects. Twentieth-century advances in microbiology enabled the first pure-culture biological agents to be developed by World War II. Interwar period and WWII In the interwar period, little research was done in biological warfare in both Britain and the United States at first. In the United Kingdom the preoccupation was mainly in withstanding the anticipated conventional bombing attacks that would be unleashed in the event of war with Germany. As tensions increased, Sir Frederick Banting began lobbying the British government to establish a research program into the research and development of biological weapons to effectively deter the Germans from launching a biological attack. Banting proposed a number of innovative schemes for the dissemination of pathogens, including aerial-spray attacks and germs distributed through the mail system. With the onset of hostilities, the Ministry of Supply finally established a biological weapons programme at Porton Down, headed by the microbiologist Paul Fildes. The research was championed by Winston Churchill and soon tularemia, anthrax, brucellosis, and botulism toxins had been effectively weaponized. In particular, Gruinard Island in Scotland, during a series of extensive tests, was contaminated with anthrax for the next 48 years. Although Britain never offensively used the biological weapons it developed, its program was the first to successfully weaponize a variety of deadly pathogens and bring them into industrial production. Other nations, notably France and Japan, had begun their own biological-weapons programs.Garrett, Laurie. Betrayal of Trust: The Collapse of Global Public Health, (Google Books), Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 340-41, (). When the United States entered the war, mounting British pressure for the creation of a similar research program for an Allied pooling of resources led to the creation of a large industrial complex at Fort Detrick, Maryland in 1942 under the direction of George W. Merck.Covert, Norman M. (2000), \\"A History of Fort Detrick, Maryland\\", 4th Edition: 2000. The biological and chemical weapons developed during that period were tested at the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah. Soon there were facilities for the mass production of anthrax spores, brucellosis, and botulism toxins, although the war was over before these weapons could be of much operational use. However, the most notorious program of the period was run by the secret Imperial Japanese Army Unit 731 during the war, based at Pingfan in Manchuria and commanded by Lieutenant General Shir≈ç Ishii. This unit did research on BW, conducted often fatal human experiments on prisoners, and produced biological weapons for combat use. Although the Japanese effort lacked the technological sophistication of the American or British programs, it far outstripped them in its widespread application and indiscriminate brutality. Biological weapons were used against both Chinese soldiers and civilians in several military campaigns. Three veterans of Unit 731 testified in a 1989 interview to the Asahi Shimbun that they contaminated the Horustein river with typhoid near the Soviet troops during the Battle of Khalkhin Gol.Hal Gold, Unit 731 testimony, 1996, p.64-66 In 1940, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force bombed Ningbo with ceramic bombs full of fleas carrying the bubonic plague.Japan triggered bubonic plague outbreak, doctor claims A film showing this operation was seen by the imperial princes Tsuneyoshi Takeda and Takahito Mikasa during a screening made by mastermind Shiro Ishii.Daniel Barenblatt, A Plague upon Humanity, 2004, p.32. During the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials the accused, such as Major General Kiyashi Kawashima, testified that as early as 1941 some 40 members of Unit 731 air-dropped plague-contaminated fleas on Changde. These operations caused epidemic plague outbreaks. Many of these operations were ineffective due to inefficient delivery systems, using disease-bearing insects rather than dispersing the agent as a bioaerosol cloud. Ban Shigeo, a technician at the Japanese Army's 9th Technical Research Institute, left an account of the activities at the Institute which was published in \\"The Truth About the Army Nororito Institute\\". Ban included an account of his trip to Nanking in 1941 to participate in the testing of poisons on Chinese prisoners. His testimony tied the Noborito Institute to the infamous Unit 731, which participated in biomedical research. During the final months of World War II, Japan planned to utilize plague as a biological weapon against U.S. civilians in San Diego, California, during Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night. They hope that it would kill tens of thousands of U.S. civilians and thereby dissuading America from attacking Japan. The plan was set to launch on September 22, 1945, at night, but it never came into fruition due to Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945.Naomi Baumslag, Murderous Medicine: Nazi Doctors, Human Experimentation, and Typhus, 2005, p.207 When the war ended, the US Army quietly enlisted certain members of Noborito in its efforts against the communist camp in the early years of the Cold War. The head of Unit 731, Shiro Ishii, was granted immunity from war crimes prosecution in exchange for providing information to the United States on the Unit's activities. Allegations were made that a \\"chemical section\\" of a US clandestine unit hidden within Yokosuka naval base was operational during the Korean War, and then worked on unspecified projects inside the United States from 1955 to 1959, before returning to Japan to enter the private sector. Some of the Unit 731 personnel were imprisoned by the Soviets, and may have been a potential source of information on Japanese weaponization. Postwar period Considerable research into BW was undertaken throughout the Cold War era by the US, UK and USSR, and probably other major nations as well, although it is generally believed that such weapons were never used. In Britain, the 1950s saw the weaponization of plague, brucellosis, tularemia and later equine encephalomyelitis and vaccinia viruses. Trial tests at sea were carried out including Operation Cauldron off Stornoway in 1952. The programme was cancelled in 1956, when the British government unilaterally renounced the use of biological and chemical weapons. The United States initiated its weaponization efforts with disease vectors in 1953, focused on Plague-fleas, EEE-mosquitoes, and yellow fever ‚Äì mosquitoes (OJ-AP). However, US medical scientists in occupied Japan undertook extensive research on insect vectors, with the assistance of former Unit 731 staff, as early as 1946. The United States Army Chemical Corps then initiated a crash program to weaponize anthrax (N) in the E61 1/2-lb hour-glass bomblet. Though the program was successful in meeting its development goals, the lack of validation on the infectivity of anthrax stalled standardization. The United States Air Force was also unsatisfied with the operational qualities of the M114/US bursting bomblet and labeled it an interim item until the Chemical Corps could deliver a superior weapon. Around 1950 the Chemical Corps also initiated a program to weaponize tularemia (UL). Shortly after the E61/N failed to make standardization, tularemia was standardized in the 3.4\\" M143 bursting spherical bomblet. This was intended for delivery by the MGM-29 Sergeant missile warhead and could produce 50% infection over a area.Countermeasures, Chapter 6 ‚Äì An Overview of Emerging Missile State Countermeasures, p. 14, accessed November 12, 2008. Although tularemia is treatable by antibiotics, treatment does not shorten the course of the disease. US conscientious objectors were used as consenting test subjects for tularemia in a program known as Operation Whitecoat. There were also many unpublicized tests carried out in public places with bio-agent simulants during the Cold War. E120 biological bomblet, developed before the U.S. signed the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention. In addition to the use of bursting bomblets for creating biological aerosols, the Chemical Corps started investigating aerosol-generating bomblets in the 1950s. The E99 was the first workable design, but was too complex to be manufactured. By the late 1950s the 4.5\\" E120 spraying spherical bomblet was developed; a B-47 bomber with a SUU-24/A dispenser could infect 50% or more of the population of a area with tularemia with the E120.Eitzen, Edward M. Medical Aspects of Chemical and Biological Warfare : Chapter 20 ‚Äì Use of Biological Weapons, (PDF: p. 6), Borden Institute, Textbooks of Military Medicine, PDF via Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base, accessed November 12, 2008. The E120 was later superseded by dry- type agents. Dry-type biologicals resemble talcum powder, and can be disseminated as aerosols using gas expulsion devices instead of a burster or complex sprayer. The Chemical Corps developed Flettner rotor bomblets and later triangular bomblets for wider coverage due to improved glide angles over Magnus-lift spherical bomblets. Weapons of this type were in advanced development by the time the program ended.Kirby, Reid. \\"The CB Battlefield Legacy: Understanding the Potential Problem of Clustered CB Weapons \\", Army Chemical Review, pp. 25‚Äì29, July‚ÄìDecember 2006, accessed November 16, 2008. From January 1962, Rocky Mountain Arsenal ‚Äúgrew, purified and biodemilitarized‚Äù plant pathogen Wheat Stem Rust (Agent TX), Puccinia graminis, var. tritici, for the Air Force biological anti-crop program. TX- treated grain was grown at the Arsenal from 1962‚Äì1968 in Sections 23‚Äì26. Unprocessed TX was also transported from Beale AFB for purification, storage, and disposal. Trichothecenes Mycotoxin is a toxin that can be extracted from Wheat Stem Rust and Rice Blast and can kill or incapacitate depending on the concentration used. The ‚Äúred mold disease‚Äù of wheat and barley in Japan is prevalent in the region that faces the Pacific Ocean. Toxic trichothecenes, including nivalenol, deoxynivalenol, and monoace tylnivalenol (fusarenon- X) from Fusarium nivale, can be isolated from moldy grains. In the suburbs of Tokyo, an illness similar to ‚Äúred mold disease‚Äù was described in an outbreak of a food borne disease, as a result of the consumption of Fusarium- infected rice. Ingestion of moldy grains that are contaminated with trichothecenes has been associated with mycotoxicosis. Although there is no evidence that biological weapons were used by the United States, China and North Korea accused the US of large-scale field testing of BW against them during the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953). At the time of the Korean War the United States had only weaponized one agent, brucellosis (\\"Agent US\\"), which is caused by Brucella suis. The original weaponized form used the M114 bursting bomblet in M33 cluster bombs. While the specific form of the biological bomb was classified until some years after the Korean War, in the various exhibits of biological weapons that Korea alleged were dropped on their country nothing resembled an M114 bomblet. There were ceramic containers that had some similarity to Japanese weapons used against the Chinese in World War II, developed by Unit 731. Cuba also accused the United States of spreading human and animal disease on their island nation. During the 1948 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war, International Red Cross reports raised suspicion that the Israeli Haganah militia had released Salmonella typhi bacteria into the water supply for the city of Acre, causing an outbreak of typhoid among the inhabitants. Egyptian troops later claimed to have captured disguised Haganah soldiers near wells in Gaza, whom they executed for allegedly attempting another attack. Israel denies these allegations.Typhoid- Biological WeaponsNTI: Country Overviews: Israel: Biological Chronology Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention In mid-1969, the UK and the Warsaw Pact, separately, introduced proposals to the UN to ban biological weapons, which would lead to the signing of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention in 1972. United States President Richard Nixon signed an executive order on November 1969, which stopped production of biological weapons in the United States and allowed only scientific research of lethal biological agents and defensive measures such as immunization and biosafety. The biological munition stockpiles were destroyed, and approximately 2,200 researchers became redundant.Alibek, K. and S. Handelman. Biohazard: The Chilling True Story of the Largest Covert Biological Weapons Program in the World‚Äì Told from Inside by the Man Who Ran it. Delta (2000) Special munitions for the United States Special Forces and the CIA and the Big Five Weapons for the military were destroyed in accordance with Nixon's executive order to end the offensive program. The CIA maintained its collection of biologicals well into 1975 when it became the subject of the senate Church Committee. The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention was signed by the US, UK, USSR and other nations, as a ban on \\"development, production and stockpiling of microbes or their poisonous products except in amounts necessary for protective and peaceful research\\" in 1972. The convention bound its signatories to a far more stringent set of regulations than had been envisioned by the 1925 Geneva Protocols. By 1996, 137 countries had signed the treaty; however it is believed that since the signing of the Convention the number of countries capable of producing such weapons has increased. The Soviet Union continued research and production of offensive biological weapons in a program called Biopreparat, despite having signed the convention. The United States had no solid proof of this program until Dr. Vladimir Pasechnik defected in 1989, and Dr. Kanatjan Alibekov, the first deputy director of Biopreparat defected in 1992. Pathogens developed by the organization would be used in open-air trials. It is known that Vozrozhdeniye Island, located in the Aral Sea, was used as a testing site. In 1971, such testing led to the accidental aerosol release of smallpox over the Aral Sea and a subsequent smallpox epidemic. During the closing stages of the Rhodesian Bush War, the Rhodesian government resorted to use chemical and biological warfare agents. Watercourses at several sites inside the Mozambique border were deliberately contaminated with cholera. These biological attacks had little impact on the fighting capability of ZANLA, but caused considerable distress to the local population. The Rhodesians also experimented with several other pathogens and toxins for use in their counterinsurgency.Glenn Cross. Dirty War: Rhodesia and Chemical Biological Warfare, 1975 to 1980. Solihull: Helion & Company (2017). After the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Iraq admitted to the United Nations inspection team to having produced 19,000 liters of concentrated botulinum toxin, of which approximately 10,000 L were loaded into military weapons; the 19,000 liters have never been fully accounted for. This is approximately three times the amount needed to kill the entire current human population by inhalation, although in practice it would be impossible to distribute it so efficiently, and, unless it is protected from oxygen, it deteriorates in storage. According to the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment 8 countries were generally reported as having undeclared offensive biological warfare programs in 1995: China, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Libya, North Korea, Syria and Taiwan. Five countries had admitted to having had offensive weapon or development programs in the past: United States, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Offensive BW programs in Iraq were dismantled by Coalition Forces and the UN after the first Gulf War (1990‚Äì91), although an Iraqi military BW program was covertly maintained in defiance of international agreements until it was apparently abandoned during 1995 and 1996.Adherence To and Compliance With Arms Control, Nonproliferation and Disarmament Agreements and Commitments, Washington, DC: US Department of State; 2005. Accessed November 18, 2008. 21st century On September 18, 2001, and for a few days thereafter, several letters were received by members of the U.S. Congress and American media outlets which contained intentionally prepared anthrax spores; the attack sickened at least 22 people of whom five died. The identity of the bioterrorist remained unknown until 2008, when an official suspect, who had committed suicide, was named. (See 2001 anthrax attacks.) Suspicions of an ongoing Iraqi biological warfare program were not substantiated in the wake of the March 2003 invasion of that country. Later that year, however, Muammar Gaddafi was persuaded to terminate Libya's biological warfare program. In 2008, according to a U.S. Congressional Research Service report, China, Cuba, Egypt, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Russia, Syria and Taiwan are considered, with varying degrees of certainty, to have some BW capability. By 2011, 165 countries had officially joined the BWC and pledged to disavow biological weapons.http://usiraq.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000678 List of historical Biological Weapons programs by country *United States biological weapons program *United Kingdom and weapons of mass destruction#Biological weapons *Soviet biological weapons program *Japanese special research units *Iraqi biological weapons program (see also Iraq and weapons of mass destruction) *South Africa and weapons of mass destruction#Biological and chemical weapons *Rhodesia and weapons of mass destruction See also *Biological warfare in popular culture References Citations Sanders- Zakre, Alicia. ‚ÄúTimeline of Syrian Chemical Weapons Activity, 2012-2018.‚Äù Arms Control Association.
