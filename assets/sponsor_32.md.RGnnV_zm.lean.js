Biography  Johann Gottfried Zinn was born in Schwabach. Considering his short life span, Zinn made a great contribution to the study of anatomy. In his book Descriptio anatomica oculi humani, he provided the first detailed and comprehensive anatomy of the human eye. In 1753 Johann Gottfried Zinn became director of the Botanic garden of the University of G√∂ttingen, and in 1755, professor in the medical faculty. In 1757 Zinn described the orchid genus Epipactis that belongs to the family Orchidaceae. He died in G√∂ttingen.  Eponyms  Botanist Carl Linnaeus designated a genus of flowers in the family Asteraceae native from Mexico as Zinnia in his honour. He coined the anatomic terms: * Zonula ciliaris Zinnii, now called Zonule of Zinn * Anulus tendineus communis also known as Annulus of Zinn (or Circle of Zinn).

The trunk of this plant is erect and 2‚Äì6 m tall. Fronds are bipinnate and 2‚Äì3 m in length. The rachis and stipe are pale to brown in colour, or flushed with red towards the pinnule rachis. The stipe is sparsely covered in narrow basal scales, which are pale to dark and have broad fragile edges. Characteristically of this species, the lowest one or two pairs of pinnae may be slightly reduced and occur towards the base of the stipe. Sori are located near the pinnule midvein and are partially or fully covered by indusia, which open towards the pinnule margin. Large and Braggins (2004) note that there is much variation between individual plants of C. affinis in terms of frond and scale details and Cyathea tahitensis, which is usually regarded as synonymous, may in fact represent a separate species. The closest relatives of C. affinis appear to be Cyathea plagiostegia and Cyathea solomonensis. This species differs from the former in its slightly larger size and larger indusia. C. affinis is not to be confused with Cyathea affinis (W. J. Hooker & Baker, 1874), a synonym of Cyathea medullaris, nor Cyathea affinis (Brackenridge, 1854), a synonym of Cyathea propinqua. Cyathea affinis (M. Martens & Galeotti, 1842) also shares its name with this taxon, but cannot be attributed to any species. Young shoots of C. affinis are eaten in the Marquesas Islands.

Opened in 1970, the mall features 153 stores in of mall shop space. Anchor stores are J. C. Penney, Macy's, and two locations of Dillard's. It is managed and owned by Simon Property Group, the successor of the same company that built it. History Melvin Simon & Associates, now known as Simon Property Group, built and developed Battlefield Mall. Their plans had begun in 1963 with a proposed Montgomery Ward department store. By 1968, J. C. Penney and Dillard's had also been confirmed as the second and third anchor stores. After two years of construction, it opened to the public on July 23, 1970. On opening day, the mall was 93 percent occupied, consisting of of shop space along with the three department stores. Among the tenants of the mall at the time were a McCrory dime store, Piccadilly Restaurants, and Osco Drug. After only five years in operation, the McCrory store was closed and converted to local department store Heer's, which opened there in 1975. The mall's owners announced an expansion plan in 1979, to consist of over of mall shops and two new anchor stores. Upon opening in 1982, this expansion added about 85 stores, including a Sears department store and a new location for Dillard's. At the same time, the original location of Dillard's in the mall was sold to Famous-Barr. In 2001, following the closure of Montgomery Ward, Dillard's moved some of its departments into the former Montgomery Ward location, while retaining other departments in the store built in 1982. This new store, known as Dillard's South, opened in 2002. The addition of Dillard's South allowed the chain to offer a greater variety of merchandise between the two stores. Another anchor store change ensued in 2006 when Federated Department Stores (now Macy's, Inc.) acquired Famous-Barr's parent company The May Department Stores Company, and renamed all of that company's stores to Macy's. On February 6, 2020 Sears announced after many years in business that it would be closing its Battlefield Mall location in mid April 2020 as part of a plan to close 39 stores nationwide.

Cyathea brownii) in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney Sphaeropteris intermedia in habitat in New Caledonia Sphaeropteris medullaris in Auckland, New Zealand Sphaeropteris is a genus of tree fern in the family Cyatheaceae. It has been treated as a subgenus within the genus Cyathea, but is accepted in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Description Species of Sphaeropteris have a treelike habit, usually with a single tall stem, and large fronds to or more in length. The stalk (stipe) of the frond is strawlike or purple in colour, with pale to brown scales. The sori (spore-bearing structures) are rounded, with or without indusia (covers). Sphaeropteris is now separated from the other genera in the family Cyatheaceae primarily on the basis of molecular phylogenetic studies. However, the scales on the stalks (petioles) provide a morphological distinction. Sphaeropteris has scales without distinct margins, whereas the other genera have scales with distinct margins. Taxonomy The genus Sphaeropteris was erected by Johann Jakob Bernhardi in 1801. It is placed in the family Cyatheaceae. The division of the family into genera has had a long and controversial history. Three or four clades have been suggested based on molecular phylogenetic studies. The Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) accepts three genera, related as shown in the cladogram below. Sphaeropteris is sister to the remaining members of the family.

Some species are also naturalized in Africa and western Australia. Species of Sphaeropteris are large plants and require space to grow. They usually prefer less shaded conditions than species of Alsophila. They are found in rain forests and tropical montane forests, often in clearings or on the margins, from the canopy layer down to the understorey layer. They are also found in ravines, swamps and disturbed areas.

Plot summary The Golden One is a combination of two stories. The first story deals with the search for an unknown tomb, one where some artifacts have started to appear on the black market. The second story follows Ramses Emerson as he is sent on another mission behind Turkish lines. After arriving in Egypt in January, 1917, Amelia acquires a magnificent cosmetic jar with the cartouche removed. Rumors of a new, previously untouched tomb are rife, and this is significant evidence. After a brief stay in Cairo, the family moves on to their home in Luxor. When the Emersons arrive in Luxor, they encounter Joe Albion and his family, a wealthy American collector of antiquities, who make no secret of his desire to deal on the black market. Cyrus Vandergelt is acquainted with Joe Albion, and tells Emerson he would do anything to get what he wanted. This riles Emerson, and relations with the Albions are frosty at best. Jamil, a former employee and Jumana‚Äôs brother, is at the center of the rumors about the tomb. Early in their excavations, the Emersons discover one looted tomb with links to Jamil. They learn that he is manipulating a number of people and even attempts to kill Emerson and Peabody. When his family confronts him, his ancient musket explodes, mortally wounding him. But before he dies, he leaves a clue to the location of the tomb ‚Äì ‚Äúin the hand of the God‚Äù. The Emerson and Vandergelt expeditions now try to figure out which ‚Äúhand of the God‚Äù Jamil meant. Just then Ramses is called back into service as an agent. An English spy, claiming to have converted to Islam, has become a tool of the Turks and is now known as Ismail, the Holy Infidel. Ramses is sent to discover if the turncoat is Sethos. It so happens that Ismail is in Gaza, just inside the Turkish lines. Ramses is forced to take a novice agent with him as well, but manages to get into Gaza without much trouble. While trying to get a look at Ismail, Ramses companion fires at Ismail and misses. In the confusion, Ramses is caught but the other agent makes his escape. The head of the Turkish secret service, Sahin Pasha, takes possession of Ramses, but makes a surprising offer: convert to Islam and marry his daughter, Esin, and he will set Ramses free. While Ramses is left to consider the offer in a dungeon, Esin engineers Ramses‚Äô escape. Meanwhile, the Emersons, who had secretly arrive in a town just behind the British lines, are ready to come to Ramses aid if needed. They get word of his capture and are working out a rescue plan when Ramses shows up. They prepare to make their getaway when Sethos also appears, with Esin in a rug. They are forced to escape to a temporary hiding place, where they again encounter Sethos. He was indeed Ismail, sent to destroy Sahin Pasha, which he has done by humiliating him. But his work is not done and he returns to Gaza. As the Emersons are about to leave for Cairo, Sahin appears, hoping to regain his status by returning with both his daughter and Ramses. Though he wounds Ramses, Emerson captures him, and they all return to Cairo. Sahin Pasha is turned over to the authorities, and Esin is sent to a secure home. When the Emersons return to Luxor, they concoct a story that for most people would be implausible, but does bear some resemblance to previous adventures, so no one asks much about it. However, the tomb is still undiscovered. The Albions are making it clear that nothing will stop them from getting what they want, and they seek to abuse Jumana‚Äôs trust as one means of doing so. Both Bertie Vandergelt and Ramses have encounters with the Albion son. When Jumana is caught by Peabody sneaking into the compound one night, Peabody assumes the worst and decides to harshly punish her. Peabody is terribly disappointed, and feels that Jumana has abused her position of trust in the family. But that morning, Cyrus and Bertie appear, unable to contain their excitement. Bertie, with help from Jumana, has found the tomb in the hills above Deir el Medina. The two of them had been climbing for the last few nights around a rock formation that looked like a fist, the ‚ÄúHand of the God‚Äù. It is a royal cache, containing the mummies and funerary times of four of the Wives of the God. Peabody realizes her mistake and for once is contrite about jumping to conclusions. Sethos reappears, and is amazed at the discovery. He also warns Emerson of the Albions. Sethos considers them unscrupulous, a serious charge coming from Sethos. But the Albions appear again, making it clear that they expect to get some of the items from the tomb. When they are sent away by Emerson and Cyrus, they decide to try force. Sethos warns Emerson, and the Emersons and Vandergelts ambush the Albions and their hired thugs. Caught by Emerson and Vandergelt, the Albions are forced to give up the few items they had bought from Jamil, and then disappear. The only thing left is the announcement that Ramses and Nefret are going to have a baby.

Advertising In the 1940s and 1950s, Parkay was the long-time sponsor of the radio program The Great Gildersleeve. Starting in 1973, a long-running advertising campaign was introduced for Parkay featuring a mechanically animated \\"talking tub\\" of the product. A typical ad depicted a sort of humorous verbal sparring match between a character mentioning Parkay, and the talking package (its lid flipping up in imitation of a mouth) correcting him by saying \\"butter\\" in a deadpan voice. The tagline: [announcer] \\"Parkay Margarine from Kraft--the flavor says...\\" [package] \\"...butter.\\" Along with the TV ad, there was a series of \\"PARKAY\\" radio jingles, :30 seconds, written by David Grober and with a variety of performers; the most famous of these performers was Thurl Ravenscroft, who was also the voice of Tony the Tiger. The 1973 commercial featured a voice over claiming Parkay tastes like butter. An argumentative housewife looks at a square box of Parkay in her kitchen and says \\"Parkay\\". The box of Parkay responds \\"butter\\", and they go back and forth until she tries a taste of it and she says \\"butter\\". At that point, the margarine says \\"Parkay!\\" This was possibly the first Parkay Margarine commercial that featured the phrase \\"the flavor says butter\\". The 1975 commercial featured a laughing Latino man argues with a square box of margarine because when he opens up the Parkay lid, it says to him \\"mantequilla\\" (butter) and he did know it is or was margarine. But when he finally tastes it, he then or momentarily says \\"butter\\" or \\"mantequilla\\" right before the box says \\"Parkay\\" in Spanish. The 1976 commercial featured Todd Bridges from Diff'rent Strokes and a white male kid laughs when one of us opens up a regular pound bowl of margarine that says \\"butter\\" until they decides to taste it, then one of them says \\"butter\\" right before the bowl says \\"Parkay.\\" Similar commercials feature actors Vic Tayback or Mel Stewart. This ad campaign was also spoofed in a skit from the PBS series The Electric Company (with cast member Skip Hinnant providing the foodstuff's voice).

The New Zealand Railways intended to replace steam locomotives for shunting duties with this class. They are physically similar to the Tasmanian Government Railways X class, which were also of English Electric design. Introduction Although NZR intended to use the class as a heavy transfer shunter, four of the DEs were used in pairs (each locomotive crewed) on 1953‚Äî1954 Royal Train tour when Queen Elizabeth II visited New Zealand. The DEs was trialled for use on suburban passenger trains in Auckland and Wellington as well as on lesser regional passenger services and branch line freight. The class was also the first to use the new Murupara Branch; for construction then for log trains on the still unsettled track bed. This has given the DE class an unofficial status of the first mainline diesel-electric locomotive in NZR service, a title correctly applied to another English Electric class, the DF class of 1954. The class was initially based in the North Island, but four of the class were sent to the South Island in 1981. The class was slowly dispersed to secondary yards on the New Zealand network, such as Napier, Dunedin and Invercargill. In the early 1980s, two DE class members received English Electric 6SRKT Mk 2 engines (which were fitted to the DG class locomotives). Withdrawal and Preservation As part of the New Zealand Railways Corporation plan to reduce the number of first-generation diesels in the late 1980s, a number of the class were scrapped or sold for preservation. Seven DE class locomotives have survived out of the original fifteen. All have operated in preservation at least once time: * DE 504/DE 1337 was sold to the Otago Polytechnic not long after being withdrawn. It was intended to use the engine in the locomotive for a recreation of a ships engine room. This never happened and the became surplus to their requirements in 1993 when it was sold to the Taieri Gorge Railway (now Dunedin Railways) who restored it to working order as DE 1337 and repainted in the TGRs Bahama Blue livery. It was repainted in 2006 to the original red livery with Larch Yellow nose stripes and wasp stripes on the headstocks as per the 1970s. DE 504 is not mainline certified. It sees occasional use pulling work trains and sometimes passenger excursions, but mostly can be see shunting in Dunedin Railways yard. It was put up for sale or leasing in mid-2015, but is still operational and can be seen being used for shunting around their depot occasionally. * DE 505/DE 1343 was sold to the Silver Stream Railway in 1984. It was one of two class members that did not receive the International Orange livery, instead bearing its original red livery with its head-stocks painted yellow until withdrawal. It is still in service on the SSR, albeit in its original livery but with the head-stocks repainted to black. * DE 507/DE 1372/GVR No.8 was sold to the Glenbrook Vintage Railway in 1988. It has since been repainted into its original livery and wears its original identity as DE 507 and GVR NO 8 in preservation. * DE 508/DE 1389 was brought to Wellington after withdrawal and restored by NZ Rail to become DE 508 in their Heritage Fleet. During this time it did some shunting work at Wellingtons carriage and wagon depot, and undertook some railfan trips. In 2003, Tranz Rail decided to disperse the Heritage Fleet with the result that the loco was given to the Rail Heritage Trust and moved to the Silver Stream Railway. The locomotive is still operational, and runs on SSR open days. It was fitted with a replica of its original cow-catcher in early 2014. * DE 509/DE 1395 was sold to the Glenbrook Vintage Railway in 1988. It kept its TMS identity as DE 1395 and its International Orange livery as it did not spend much time in service for its new owners, but instead ended up in storage by 1990 without ever carrying its new identity as GVR NO 9\\\\. This locomotive is the last surviving Royal Train DE. * DE 511/DE 1412 was sold to the Diesel Traction Group in 1988. It was restored as DE 511 and journeyed with DG 772 to Springfield on an excursion as part of the Rail 125 celebrations in 1988. The locomotive is currently undergoing repairs after being in storage. * DE 512/DE 1429 was sold to the Diesel Traction Group in 1988. It was restored as DE 1429, and has been the only operational DE to wear the International Orange livery in preservation. The locomotive still saw occasional use at Ferrymead, and has in the past attended the famous Waipara Vintage Festivals hosted by the Weka Pass Railway. The locomotive has been on long-term loan to the WPR since September 2015.

History  Oholei Torah, 2011 Oholei Torah was founded in early 1957 by Rabbi Michoel Teitelbaum, The curriculum focuses on torah study. The school opened in a synagogue in Brownsville with a handful of students. In 1958, the school expanded and a kindergarten for young boys was introduced. In 1964, Oholei Torah added a junior high school division, followed several years later by Oholei Torah Mesivta High School. The Beis HaMedrash, Talmudic Seminary Oholei Torah was founded in 1970, for post-high school Talmudic studies. In 1975, the school began renting space for the elementary classes at the Brooklyn Jewish Center at 667 Eastern Parkway, built in 1920, and purchased the building outright in 1982. Beginning in 1997, the building underwent a major expansion, with a new wing (known as the Deitsch Campus, after the school's major financial patron Dovid Deitsch) and a study hall for the Talmudical Seminary. In 1994, the elementary school was renamed \\"Oholei Menachem\\" in honor of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, though the old name persists in general usage. Today Oholei Torah enrolls approximately 1600 students in its various divisions. In 2016 the school was the subject of an expos√© in Newsweek for its failure for years to fire teachers who physically abused and molested students.Newsweek published 3rd March 2016, retrieved 23rd Jan 2020 =Divisions= Educational Institute Oholei Menachem (Oholei Torah) consists of a preschool grade (Pre-1A) and 8 elementary grades. Each grade has an average enrollment of about 100 students, so there are four or five classes for each grade. Oholei Torah's kindergarten elementary school and middle school are located in the Deitsch Campus at 667 Eastern Parkway. There is also a smaller kindergarten division at Cong. B'nai Abraham in East Flatbush, a synagogue where Rabbi Teitelbaum served as president until his death in 2005. Oholei Torah Mesivta is located at 417 Troy Avenue (the Rabbi Jacob J. Reines Shul). There is also a branch of the Mesivta, Yeshivas Beis Dovid Shlomo at 292 Norton Street., New Haven, Connecticut. The Beis Medrash, formally called Talmudical Seminary Oholei Torah, and colloquially as Oholei Torah Zal (Yiddish zal, [study] hall), is the largest Lubavitch yeshiva in the United States. The Seminary currently has around 250 students. About 1/3 of the students live locally; the rest come from other parts of the United States, as well as Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, France, Israel, South America and South Africa. Oholei Torah has a dormitory to house its Beis Medrash students. Located in a former apartment house at 645 Eastern Parkway, the dorm houses over 100 students. Publications Since 1979 the Beis Medrash has published a journal (formerly weekly, now biweekly) Haoros U'bi'urim Oholei Torah, and an annual volume, which has variously been called Kovetz Oholei Torah or Kovetz Pilpulim. Both contain essays on various torah topics, mostly contributed by current students and staff, as well as alumni. Occasionally prominent non-Lubavitch rabbis, such as Rabbi Gavriel Zinner, submit papers to the journal, which is edited by Rabbi Avrohom Y. Gerlitzky, who also contributes at least one essay to each issue.)

Akonting player in Bagaya The akonting (or ekonting in French transliteration) is the folk lute of the Jola people, found in Senegal, Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau in West Africa. It is a banjo-like instrument with a skin-headed gourd body, two long melody strings, and one short drone string, akin to the short fifth \\"thumb string\\" on the five-string banjo. Jola oral tradition places the birthplace of the akonting in the village of Kanjanka in Lower Casamance (Senegal), near the banks of the Casamance River. The name of the instrument's home village is recalled in the most common tuning pattern for the akonting's three open strings (from the 3rd short \\"thumb\\" string to the 1st long melody string): kan (the 5th note of the scale, tuned an octave higher), jan (root note), ka (flatted 7th note). Like in the traditional old-time/folk styles of playing the 5-string banjo, the akonting is tuned in different tunings. Using the kanjanka tuning pattern of 5/1/-7, a common tuning in Casamance is dGF. In Gambia, for another variant the 1st long melody is raised a semitone (half- step) higher to make a natural 7th note, as in cFE. Gambian Jola scholar/musician Daniel Laemouahuma Jatta, who pioneered the research and documentation of the akonting in the mid-1980s, describes the music of his people's folk lute as follows: The akonting is practically identical to the buchundu of the related Manjago people (also Man'yago, Manjaku, Manjaco and Manjaca) of Gambia and Guinea-Bissau, as well as the busunde of the Papel people and the kisinta of the Balanta people, both of Guinea-Bissau. Recent findings presented by researchers Daniel Laemouahuma Jatta, Ulf J√§gfors, and Shlomo Pestcoe at The 8th Annual Banjo Collectors Gathering (December, 2005) ‚Äì an annual international conference of the foremost collectors and scholars of 19th and early 20th century banjos, which also serves as the principal forum for presentations of new research on the banjo's history and organology ‚Äì indicate that the banjo is probably descended from the many different types of gourd-bodied folk/artisan plucked lutes found throughout West Africa, like the akonting and its aforementioned Senegambian siblings. Other varieties include the Frafra koliko (Ghana), The Kotokoli (also Tem or Temba) lawa (Togo, Benin and Ghana), the Gwari kaburu (Nigeria), and the Hausa gurmi, komo, komsa and wase (Nigeria, Niger, Ghana), to name but a few. The earliest forms of the banjo were, in fact, very similar gourd-bodied lutes, which enslaved West Africans in the Caribbean began making and playing sometime in the early 17th century. Construction According to the Jola tradition, the main body of the akonting is made from a gourd, the skin of an animal (in most cases it is likely to be a calf's skin), and a large papyrus stalk (though large wooden dowels/rods are also used). Firstly, a large gourd cut into a hemispherical shape is filled with packed sand, to aid in its structural integrity throughout the building process. in the sand, a line is marked out across the gourd's diameter for the papyrus stalk to snugly pass through later on. On either end of line, a notch is cut into the gourd, which is what the stalk will fit into later. With the help of several people, an animal skin is stretched over the open half of the gourd and tacks are inserted through the edge of the skin into the gourd to secure it in place and keep it at tension. the skin is then trimmed to size as closely to the tacks as possible. Often, a longer piece is left untrimmed in about four different places around the gourd, where any final pulling and retensioning of the skin can be made. These flaps can later be intricately cut and twisted and tacked into place for an artistic effect. The papyrus stalk is cut to size with a knife and sharpened to a point on one end. Above each place where the notches were carved into the gourd, a small slit is made in the skin, where the papyrus stalk is pushed through, spike first, all the way along so that the spike is at the 'head' of the instrument and a fairly small length of the stalk serves as a 'spike' or 'tail' sticking out of the back end of the gourd, from where the strings are attached. A circular hole is cut into the side of the gourd to empty the sand out of it. Often, an additional decorative hole will be cut into the gourd. A fairly thick bridge (compared to western standards) is cut from a block of wood, with three notches for the three strings. The strings themselves are made from 60-80 pound test fishing line. They are attached to the instrument first with a slip knot, which is attached to the bottom end of the papyrus stalk. Then it is attached at the top with a fairly complicated knot, which traditionally involves holding the string in place on the stalk while wrapping the excess length of the line around the stalk and itself six times, then on the next three times it is wrapped around the stalk and under the string, pulled upwards and fed through the loop made from where the maker's finger was holding the string in place. This keeps the string in place with high friction. After all three lengths of strings are attached, the bridge is fitted in the middle of the skin covering of the gourd, each foot of the bridge resting on either side of the stalk. The strings are tuned using a hard, flat object, such as the handle of a metal spoon, which is put underneath the string up against the top knot, and, using the leverage from the handle, is pulled upwards to sharpen the note. Missing link to the banjo? Of all the myriad variety of West African plucked lutes, the Jola akonting stands out as the one instrument today that bears the strongest resemblance to early North American gourd banjos. This is seen not just in its physiology but also in the traditional technique used to play the akonting, called o'teck (literally, \\"to stroke\\"), which is basically the same as the stroke, or frailing style, considered to be the oldest extant technique for playing the banjo. Both the akonting o'teck and the banjo stroke style are forms of down-picking, a technique in which the fingernail of a single finger ‚Äì either the index or middle finger ‚Äì is used to strike the individual melody strings in a downward motion, like a plectrum. This action is immediately followed by the player's thumb catching on the top short \\"thumb string\\" to create a rhythmic back-beat accompaniment. It was the stroke style of banjo that European American performers, who came to be known as blackface minstrels (see minstrel show), initially learned from African American musicians in the early 19th century. (The blackface minstrels popularized the banjo in the 1830s and 40s. Prior to that the banjo was a folk instrument exclusive to African American and African Caribbean musicians.) This was the prevalent form of playing the 5-string banjo until the advent of the guitar style of up- picking in the late 1860s, also referred to as finger-picking. The stroke style of down-picking has survived to this very day in the folk traditions of both the black and white communities of the rural South, where it's commonly referred to as frailing, clawhammer, thumping, among other terms. Remarkably, the Jola o'teck technique of playing the akonting is the only extant down- picking style of lute playing found in all of West Africa thus far. Even more pertinent to the ongoing search for the banjo's ancestors, it's the only West African lute with a banjo-like short \\"thumb string\\" which is played in this manner. In addition to the Jola akonting, the Manjago buchundu, the Papel busunde, the Balanta kisinta, and all the various kinds of wooden-bodied lutes that are exclusive to the griots (for example, the Mande ngoni, the Wolof xalam, the Fula hoddu, and the Soninke gambare) have a short \\"thumb string\\" drone. The \\"thumb string\\" seems to be a feature unique to lutes of Senegambian origin which have three or more strings and are played with the fingers, regardless of playing style. Conversely, 1-string lutes (e.g. the gourd-bodied gambra of the Haratin of Mauritania) and 2-string lutes (e.g. the gourd-bodied koliko of the Frafra of Ghana and the wooden-bodied garaya of the Hausa of Nigeria, Niger, and Ghana) are played with flat-pick type plectrums, so a drone string is useless on these instruments. The standard griot playing technique is a 2-finger up-picking pattern: the player's index finger plucks up on a melody string, followed by the thumb plucking the short drone string, and culminating with the index finger brushing down all the strings. While the griot technique is strikingly similar to some styles of old-time 2-finger up- picking found in various regions of rural southern United States, it is distinctly different from down-picking and not related to the early \\"stroke style\\" of playing the 5-string banjo or its descendants, the various old-time Southern down-picking styles. The Akonting today In the mid-1980s, when Gambian Jola scholar/musician Daniel Laemouahuma Jatta first began to research and document his people's folk lute, the akonting, the tradition of making and playing the instrument was relatively unknown outside of the rural Jola villages found throughout Senegambia. Even within these Jola communities, there were very few young people interested in carrying on the akonting tradition. Recognizing this fact, Daniel's father, a traditional akonting player originally from the instrument's birthplace, the Casamance region of Senegal, implored him to take up the akonting and help perpetuate this vital element of their people's cultural heritage. Today, there is a burgeoning revival of interest in the akonting within its home region of Senegambia. Young akonting players like Bouba Diedhiou, a teenage radio performer from a rural Casamance village is carrying on the traditional style; also, Sana Ndiaye, best known for his work with the Dakar-based hip hop group Gokh-Bi System, is introducing the instrument to broader audiences. Thanks to the work of Daniel Jatta, as well as the vital efforts of Swedish banjoist/researcher Ulf J√§gfors, British banjo historian Nick Bamber, American old-time country musician/scholar Ben Nelson, banjoist/ gourd musical instrument expert/builder Paul Sedgwick, and others, there is growing global awareness of the akonting and its siblings in the large diverse family of West African folk/artisan lutes, which have been hitherto overlooked. These instruments are just now beginning to get the international recognition and attention they deserve as living ancestors of the banjo. Many museums around the world have updated their collections to include the akonting and other members of the West African folk/artisan lute family, while banjo historians and ethnomusicologists have begun to broaden the range of their focus to include these instruments.

The mosque is the oldest mosque in the Zagros area and western Iran. It ranks as No. 228 in the Inventory of National Artefacts of Iran. The mosque located in the old district of Borujerd city previously called Do Dangeh. Jameh Mosque of Borujerd was built on an ancient fire-temple of the pre-Islamic Sassanid dynasty. History  Engraving in the mosque dating to the Safavid dynasty. The construction of this mosque is attributed to a certain Hamuyeh, or Hamuleh, said to have been appointed by the Abi-Dolaf rulers as the governor of Borujerd in the 3rd century A.H. (9th century CE). Judging by the evidences, continuous works of construction, reconstruction and restoration within the perimeter of the Jameh mosque of Borujerd are confirmed ever since the 3rd century up to the present; the culmination of this activity occurring in the Seljuk period. The architectural works done here in the 4th and 5th centuries have been compared ‚Äì owing to the execution of the main pillars, the round based pseudo-columns, the brick decorations ‚Äì to the mausoleum of Amir Esma‚Äôil the Samanid in Bukhara. The plan of the mosque's dome chamber and that of its secondary aisles at the corners of the perimeter have been likened to those of Heidaryyah Qazvin and the Jameh Mosque of Golpayegan. Assuming seven periods of restoration and essential repair, it is said that the most ancient part of the ensemble is its principle dome construction, now surrounded by adjunctions of later periods. The portico and minarets of the Jameh mosque are said to have been built in 1209 AH (1794/5 CE), as an adjunction to its lofty arch built under Ma‚Äômun and Mo‚Äôtassem. The religious and poetic inscriptions visible upon the entrance arch and on the wooden minbar and door of the mosque speak of these architectural alterations in the course of history. March 2006 earthquake. This mosque has two entrances, on its eastern and western sides. The interior fa√ßade of the dome-covered space, beside the architectural adjunction made in various periods, incorporates refined decorations, including an exquisite epigraph on the southern wall, above the mihrab. Beside the majesty and importance of this building and the delicacy of its architectural fabric, note must be made of the mosque's nine-stepped minbar, of particular importance. It was crafted by carpenter Dervish Yar-Muhammad upon an order from the Safavid king Shah Abbas II, and bears a poetic epigraph the last diptych of which gives, in Abjad figures, the construction date of the minbar [1069 AH = 1658/9 AD]. On the western entrance door, two other diptychs are carved, which beside the construction date of the mosque [1092 AH], gives the name of its builder. Jameh mosque has been used as a religious, trading and social affair centre. The complex includes the Jameh Mosque used for Friday Prayer and public gatherings, Gharib Khaneh (an asylum for the poor and invalids), a Hammam (public bathhouse), a field and an Ab-Anbar (underground water storehouse).

Patterson was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, and educated at the University of Manitoba. Patterson arrived in the United Kingdom in 1960. Trained as a nuclear physicist, Patterson has spent his life teaching, writing and campaigning. In 1972, he became Friends of the Earth's first energy campaigner (1972‚Äì78) at their London office. In 1984‚Äì5, Patterson acted as series advisor to the award-winning BBC drama series Edge of Darkness. Patterson has published fourteen books and hundreds of papers, articles and reviews, on nuclear power, coal technology, renewable energy, energy systems, energy policy, and electricity. His most recent book, self-published online in April 2015, is Electricity Vs Fire: The Fight For Our Future. It argues that a key cause of global problems is human use of fire - polluting city air worldwide, creating international tension about fuel to feed fire, and overheating the planet. To reduce the damage will entail using less fire, especially by improving buildings and by accelerating the shift from fire-based to fire-free electricity. Since 1991 Patterson has been a Fellow of what is now the Energy, Environment and Resources Programme at Chatham House in London. He is a Fellow of the Energy Institute, London, and a Visiting Fellow of the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex. He is chair of the Seoul International Energy Advisory Council and a founder-member of the International Energy Advisory Council.  Awards  In 2000, the Institute of Energy, now the Energy Institute, awarded Patterson its annual Melchett Medal. In 2004, Scientific American honoured Patterson as Energy Policy Leader for his work in pioneering the concept of distributed micropower generation.

This includes both auto racing and horse racing. The grandstand is in essence like a single section of a stadium, but differs from a stadium in that it does not wrap all or most of the way around. Grandstands may have basic bench seating, but usually have individual chairs like a stadium. Grandstands are also usually covered with a roof, but are open on the front. They are often multi-tiered. Grandstands are found at places like Epsom Downs Racecourse and Atlanta Motor Speedway. They may also be found at fairgrounds, circuses, and outdoor arenas used for rodeos. In the United States, smaller stands are called bleachers, and are usually far more basic and typically single-tiered (hence the difference from a \\"grand stand\\"). Early baseball games were often staged at fairgrounds, and the term \\"grandstand\\" came along when standalone baseball parks began to be built. A covered bleacher may be called a \\"pavilion\\", also to distinguish from the main \\"grandstand\\".

Explanation of the novel's title The title is an excerpt from an ancient Egyptian horoscope: :\\"The day of the children of the storm. Very dangerous. Do not go on the water this day.\\" Plot summary The 1919 season opens with the Vandergelts and Emersons packing the God's Wives treasures found (in the previous book) for Cyrus Vandergelt by his adopted son Bertie. Just after the Service d'Antiquit√©s representative comes to inspect their work, several items disappear together with the conservator Cyrus had hired on Sethos's recommendation. The conservator's skeleton is found later in the desert, without the objects. These events coincide with a visit from Emerson's brother Walter, his wife Evelyn, their daughter Lia and her husband David (the Emersons' adoptive son), plus their small children. Meanwhile, the Emersons meet up with Justin Fitzroyce, a young person with a strange mental malady, and his companion, Fran√ßois, who quickly develops a dislike of the family after Ramses mistakes his attentions to the boy for physical abuse. Justin is travelling with his grandmother, the elderly, sometimes confused, Mrs Fitzroyce; also with them is her companion, who turns out to be Maryam, the teenage daughter of Sethos, fallen on hard times. Amelia tries to befriend Maryam and helps her to rebuild her relationship with her father when he arrives to visit. She also reassures Maryam that the Emersons were not responsible for the death of the girl's mother, Bertha. Along the way, the Emerson family is dogged by a series of mysterious events ranging from strange pranks to near-fatal accidents. Most of these seem to be directed at the Arab servants, including Selim, who is badly injured when a motor-car imported by Emerson crashes as a result of the wheel-nuts having been removed. The exception is a mystery attacker who targets Maryam. In addition, Ramses is temporarily taken prisoner and drugged by a mysterious woman disguised as the goddess Hathor. The same woman later reappears at the temple ruins during the night but the Emersons fail to apprehend her. As the head of the Service arrives to take possession of the treasure for transport to Cairo, Nefret is captured by the criminal gang intent on stealing the treasure, and held prisoner on the dahabeeyah belonging to the FitzRoyces, as is Emerson when he impetuously comes to rescue her. \\"Justin\\" is revealed as Maryam's elder half- sister and \\"Mrs FitzRoyce\\" as an old associate of Bertha's. Through Emerson's efforts, Nefret escapes through a window of the boat, to be picked up by passing fishermen; meanwhile Maryam, who is implicated in the plot, shows her true loyalties by rescuing Emerson. The final chase scene has Amelia, Rameses, Sethos, Selim, Daoud, Cyrus, Walter, and Bertie racing down-river armed to the teeth to rescue Nefret and Emerson, and is unlike any other scene in the Amelia series. Characters in \\"Children of the Storm\\" This book is notable in that the entire Emerson clan is present: Professor and Amelia Emerson, Walter and Evelyn Emerson, Ramses and Nefret Emerson and their children David John and Charla, Sennia Emerson, David and Lia Todros and their children Dolly and Evie, Sethos, and Maryam. It is also in this book that Sethos finally reveals his given name (Seth), to Evelyn.

Its existence has been disputed; it may be stable below 0 ¬∞C or in suitable environments, but is unstable at room temperature, decomposing into metallic mercury and mercury(II) sulfide (mercuric sulfide, cinnabar). Ronald L. Rich (2007): \\"Zinc through Mercury\\". In: Inorganic Reactions in Water, pages 289‚Äì306. Published by Springer. History This compound was described in the 19th century by Berzelius as a black precipitate obtained by passing hydrogen sulfide through solutions of mercury(I) saltsBerzelius, Lehrb.Berzelius: Archiv des Apotheker Vereins im n√∂rdlichen Deutschland.Charles Baskerville (1903): \\"Mercurous sulphide\\". Journal of the American Chemical Society, volume 25, issue 8, pages 799‚Äì800. . As of 1825, the London Pharmacopoeia listed a compound called \\"Ethiops- mineral\\" or Hydrargyri Sulphuretum Nigrum (\\"black sulfide of mercury\\"), a black powder that was obtained by combining solid sulfur and mercury at room temperature. This preparation did not leave the characteristic stain of metallic mercury when rubbed onto gold. When a large amount of Ethiops-mineral was vigorously ground, however, it formed mercury and cinnabar with evolution of smoke and heat. However, the existence of mercurous sulfide was disputed in 1816 by French pharmacist N. Guibourt. In his thesis he claimed that the precipitate obtained in such a manner was nothing more than an intimate mixture of mercury(II) sulfide (mercuric sulfide, cinnabar) and metallic mercury , which could be separated by heating or grinding. (Guibourt also denied the reality of mercurous oxide , for the same reason.)Nicolas-Jean- Baptiste-Gaston Guibourt (1816): \\"Th√®se sur le Mercure et sur ses Combinaisons avec l‚ÄôOxig√®ne et le Soufre\\". √âcole Sp√©ciale de PharmacieNicolas-Jean- Baptiste-Gaston Guibourt (1816): \\"Th√®se sur le Mercure et sur ses Combinaisons avec l‚ÄôOxig√®ne et le Soufre\\".

Reviewing Guibourt's article in 1825, British chemist W. T. Brande disputed his conclusions. He observed that the proportions of mercury and sulfur in the precipitate are stoichometric for the formula ; and that nitrogen triiodide, silver fulminate, and mercury fulminate were accepted compounds, even though they were decomposed by slight friction. He claimed that the black precipitate did not show any sign of metallic mercury or cinnabar (although it was easily decomposed into them). He also noted that hot nitric acid does not attack cinnabar, whereas it quickly turns precipitated \\"mercurous sulfide\\" to mercuric nitrate without leaving any residue. In 1894, Italian chemists Antony and Sestini claimed to have determined that mercurous sulfide was stable at ‚Äì10 ¬∞C, but disproportionated into and when heated to 0 ¬∞C.Ubaldo Antony and Quirino Sestini (1894): Gazetta chimica italiana, volume 24 (XXIV), issue 1, pages 193-198.W. J. P. abstractor (1894): \\"Mercurous sulphide\\".Journal of the Chemical Society, Abstracts, volume 66, pages B318‚ÄìB319. Chemical properties According to W. T. Brande, mercurous sulfide is easily decomposed by trituration, exposure to sunlight, or heating to 300 ¬∞F. It reacts with hot nitric acid yielding mercuric nitrate. Boiling with potassium carbonate (\\"potassa\\", potash) removes part of the sulfur leaving pure cinnabar as residue. Structure The structural formula is supposed to contain two mercury atoms bound to each other, as in the real compound mercury(I) chloride (calomel), . The latter is an ionic compound with the dimercury(I) cation, or +Hg‚ÄìHg+, and chloride anions . However, like cinnabar, may be a covalent polymer rather than an ionic compound. Many stable polymeric mercury compounds with the bonding system E-Hg-Hg-E (E = N,P,As,Sb,O,S,Se,Sn) have been described since 1958.Klaus Brodersen, G√ºnter Liehr, and Wolfgang R√∂lz(1975): \\"Stabile Quecksilber(I)‚ÄêSchwefel‚ÄêVerbindungen, 1\\". Chemische Berichte, volume 108, issue 10, pages 3243‚Äì3246, One may also note that the stable compound , recently synthesized, was found to consist of two-dimensional polymeric cations [‚Äì(S‚Äì)‚ÄìHg‚ÄìHg‚Äì(S‚ÄìHg‚Äì)‚ÄìHg‚Äì balanced by one-dimensional polymeric anions [‚Äì‚Äì. In the cations, the sulfur atoms are trivalent, and the mercury atoms are divalent. In each unit, two of the mercury atoms form S‚ÄìHg‚ÄìS bridges, while the other two form an S‚ÄìHg‚ÄìHg‚ÄìS bridge.Alois Lecker (2011): \\"Synthese, Strukturchemie und physikalische Untersuchungen an Mangan-, Eisen- und Quecksilber-Chalkogenometallatverbindungen\\".

Preparation =New insight= New insights that might lead to the successful synthesis of has been coming since 1958 through the work of Klaus Brodersen and others. The reaction between dimercury(I) salts and Lewis bases in polar solvents normally destroys the Hg‚ÄìHg bond. The successful preparation of S‚ÄìHg‚ÄìHg‚ÄìS compounds can be achieved with nonpolar solvents, weak Lewis bases, and NH acidic nitrogen compounds. =Older claims= In the 19th and early 20th centuries, several preparation routes for have been described, but their reliability is questionable. According to W. T. Brande (1825), mercurous sulfide can be reliably obtained by passing through a very dilute solution of mercurous chloride (calomel) or nitrate, and carefully filtering the black precipitate. According to 19th- century pharmacopoeia, the preparation Ethiops-mineral, claimed to be mercurous sulfide, was prepared by gentle grinding of equal parts of mercury and sulfur, until the mercury globules were no longer visible. According to Scherer, could be obtained by reaction of mercurous nitrate and sodium thiosulfate . However, a review of the procedure by J. T. Norton in 1900 cast doubts on the claim.John T. Norton Jr. (1900), \\"The Titration of Meroury by Sodium Thiosulphate\\". American Journal of Science, volume 10, issue 55, article V, pages 48‚Äì54. A report from 1903 by American chemist Charles Baskerville claims that sulfuric acid left over metallic mercury in a closed bottle for over 5 years developed a crust over the metal that was found to be mercurous sulfide.

He was part of the consortium that brought the Atlanta Flames of the National Hockey League (NHL) to Calgary in 1980, and remained a part-owner of the Calgary Flames until shortly before his death. For much of that time, he was the team's governor, and hence the public face of the ownership group. He served as chairman of the board of the NHL between 1995 and 2007, and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder in 2006. A graduate of Michigan State University in 1951 and a geologist by trade, Hotchkiss moved to Calgary in 1951 and began a long career in the oil and gas industry. He served as president of Alcon Petroleum into the 1960s, and started up his own companies, including Sabre Petroleum with long-time business partners Byron and Doc Seaman. His peers remembered him as an \\"icon\\" in the industry. In 1980, he joined with Ralph T. Scurfield, Norman Green, Norman Kwong and the Seaman brothers to buy the Flames and move them to Calgary. A noted philanthropist, the University of Calgary's Hotchkiss Brain Institute is named in honour of his contributions. He also supported Hockey Canada, investing in the growth of the sport across the country. He was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1997, elevated to Companion in 2009, and named to the Alberta Order of Excellence in 1998.

He was designated as a National Artist of the Philippines for Sculpture in 1973, three years before his death. Early life and education Tolentino was born on July 24, 1890 in Malolos, Bulacan. He was the fourth child in his family and had seven siblings. Before being interested in sculptures, he learned how to play the guitar, a skill which he inherited from his father. The young Tolentino showed an early talent in sculpting, having been able to mold figures of horses and dogs out of clay. Tolentino started studying in Malolos Intermediate School and continued his high school years in the same city. After studying in Malolos, Tolentino went to Manila and attended classes in the School of Fine Arts of the University of the Philippines. In 1911, Tolentino made an illustration of prominent Filipinos posing for a studio portrait. Among those included were national heroes, revolutionaries, and politicians. The illustration was lithographed and published in a weekly magazine called Liwayway under the name \\"Grupo de Filipinos Ilustres\\" and became popular among homes in the 20th century. Tolentino, a student at the university when he made the illustration, didn't earn any money from it but didn't seem to mind about it. Tolentino graduated in 1915 with a degree in Fine Arts. Career Detail of Tolentino's statues of Bonifacio and the Katipuneros Tolentino, upon returning from Europe in 1925, was appointed as a professor at the University of the Philippines' School of Fine Arts and opened his studio in Manila on January 24. Along with thirteen artists, Tolentino joined a contest in 1930 to design the Bonifacio Monument. Instead of basing the statues on printed materials, he interviewed people who participated in the Philippine Revolution. Bonifacio's figure was based on the bone structure of Espiridiona Bonifacio, the Supremo's surviving sister. Down to seven entries, the committee had its winners by July 29. Tolentino's entry won first place and was given a cash prize of 3,000 pesos. In 1935, Rafael Palma, president of the University of the Philippines, commissioned Tolentino to sculpt the Oblation, a statue based on the second stanza of Jose Rizal's Mi ultimo adios. Tolentino used concrete to create the statue but it was painted to look like bronze. The statue's model was Anastacio Caedo, his assistant, whose physique was combined with the proportion of Virgilio Raymundo, his brother-in-law. The University of the Philippines Alumni Association requested Tolentino on October 25, 1935 to construct an arch commemorating the inauguration of the Commonwealth of the Philippines but it was never built, because of the war. In the absence of Fernando Amorsolo, Tolentino was appointed acting director of the School of Fine Arts and eventually became its director two years later, on August 4, 1953. Besides monuments, Tolentino made smaller sculptures, which are now located in the National Museum of Fine Arts and busts of heroes at the Malaca√±ang Palace. He also designed the medals of the Ramon Magsaysay Award and the seal of the Republic of the Philippines. Later Years In 1955, Tolentino retired from service in the University of the Philippines and returned to private practice. He received various awards and distinctions in his later years, most notably his declaration as National Artist by Ferdinand Marcos on May 15, 1973. Death Tolentino died at 8:00 in the evening on July 12, 1976 at his house in Retiro Street, Quezon City. He was interred at the Libingan ng mga Bayani, which was part of his privileges as a national artist.

The prison is operated by Serco. History Doncaster Prison was built on the site of Doncaster Power Station, and opened in 1994. Management of the prison was originally contracted out by the Home Office to Premier Prison Services Ltd, a joint venture between Serco and US company Wackenhut Corrections. In 2005, Serco bought out Wackenhut and now runs the prison alone. In 1999, the then Home Secretary, Jack Straw, was criticised for awarding Doncaster Prison a Charter Mark, when it emerged that Doncaster had the worst suicide record of any prison in England and Wales. Jack Straw defended his decision as an \\"unfortunate coincidence of timing\\". In 2004, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons accused Serco of \\"institutional meanness\\" at Doncaster Prison, and described conditions there as \\"squalid\\". Four years later, an unannounced inspection of the prison found inmates sleeping in toilets because of overcrowding. The prison today Classified as a 'local remand' prison, Doncaster can hold 1,145 inmates as of August 2007, considerably more than its original design envisaged. Accommodation at the prison comprises three houseblocks, each houseblock has 4 wings and each wing can hold a maximum of 90 prisoners. The Health Care Centre has 29 beds for in-patients on one floor with a further 36 beds on the lower floor for enhanced workers. The prison provides education ‚Äì literacy, numeracy, information technology and vocational skills - healthcare, drug and alcohol counselling, and offending behaviour courses. Doncaster has links with the local community in order to reduce the chances of former prisoners re-offending. Schemes have been set up with local employers, landlords and other agencies to try to ensure ex-prisoners have a successful resettlement into the community. The prison also has links with a ‚Äòhalfway house‚Äô in a nearby town where prisoners can live after release as they adjust to life beyond the prison wall. The prison has been nicknamed \\"Doncatraz\\" by inmates and locals, in reference to the famous Alcatraz prison, in San Francisco Bay. The prison lies between branches of the River Don, River Don Navigation and River Cheswold and appears to be on an 'island'. Doncaster Prison is overcrowded and frequently two prisoners are forced to share a cell designed for one. In July 2018 1,087 prisoners fitted into spaces designed for 738. Overcrowding leads to increased assaults on staff and on other prisoners.Concerns over levels of overcrowding in Doncaster jails =Controversial death= Jordan Hullock aged 19 died while imprisoned at Doncaster prison in 2015. Hullock had a number of physical conditions but died of meningitis; his health was for several days so bad that staff raised concerns with senior management but little was done. Nottinghamshire NHS Foundation Trust was responsible for prison healthcare at the time. Hullock had a heart condition which was at first overlooked though this information was given to the prison. He stated he felt unwell, he stopped eating and drinking and became dehydrated, incontinent and immobile, and fell to the floor several times. It appears the prison treated Hullock's condition as psychiatric, ignoring his raised body temperature and low blood pressure. It was a week before a GP saw Hullock, after which he was transferred urgently to hospital where he died. When Hullock stopped communicating his mother phoned and emailed the prison many times but this did not help.Inquest to explore extraordinary lack of response to ill health of teenager Jordan Hullock at HMP Doncaster An inquest jury found the cause of death was Bacterial Meningitis, pneumonia and his heart condition (Aortic Stenosis). The jury decided prison staff should have done more to get a GP to see Hullock earlier. The jury also stated, ‚ÄúThe facts show serious failures in the medical attention given to the deceased following his collapse on 23 June and prior to being seen by the doctor on 24 June 2015.‚Äù Hullock's mother, Marie Hullock, said, ‚ÄúNot being informed of our child's admission to hospital denied us of the chance to say goodbye. We cannot believe the inhuman and degrading treatment he received while in Doncaster prison. Four years on we are still devastated and angry that we have lost our loving son. We have persisted with this battle to try to get some answers and justice, not only for Jordan losing his life, but for the days and days of suffering he endured whilst he was ridiculously poorly in HMP Doncaster.\\"Teenager whose meningitis and heart condition was overlooked was failed by HMP Doncaster healthcare staff, inquest finds Notable former inmates * Prince Naseem Hamed, former boxing world champion, jailed for driving dangerously. * Baron Ahmed, a member of the House of Lords, jailed for driving dangerously. * Jordan Robertson, former footballer jailed for causing death by dangerous driving.

Plot summary The story begins in summer, 1907, ten years after the Emersons' expedition into the Nubian desert in The Last Camel Died at Noon, when the Emersons were lured to a Lost Oasis where the remains of a Meroitic - Ancient Egyptian civilization that had avoided the outside world for centuries still survived. It was during that journey that the Emersons brought back Nefret Forth to live with them in England. A messenger from the Lost Oasis now appears at their home in Kent, pleading for help for their friend, King Tarek, and they have no choice but to go to his aid, though they mistrust the young man who claims to be Tarek's younger half-brother. This time it is Ramses who experiences the feeling of foreboding that normally assails Amelia, as they head off to the Sudan and into the desert to help their friend. Unlike their first trip, they bring a far larger force, in full awareness that the Lost Oasis will no longer be a secret no matter what the outcome of this expedition. It soon becomes apparent that the Emersons are not the only ones interested in the Lost Oasis. They run into too many people who are interested in their travel plans, and ultimately bring some unexpected guests with them. These include a British adventurer who has in his company a mysterious young woman. The girl unsuccessfully attempts to seduce Ramses, but he remains strangely attracted to her, although he is really in love with Nefret. Upon their arrival, the family finds things have indeed become desperate for King Tarek, who has been deposed by the father of the duplicitous messenger who brought them to the oasis. The usurper's plan is to obtain the endorsement of the Emerson family in order to neutralise any popular resistance this regime. Nefret, who up until now has seemed to miss her old life, is taken from the group and made to resume her position as high priestess. When Amelia catches an intruder in their quarters, she is relieved to find that it is her old enemy and admirer Sethos, and he promises to help rescue Nefret. Amelia is up to her usual plotting and lists, Emerson is as bombastic as ever, Ramses plays the part of the action hero, and the assistance of Selim and Daoud becomes essential to the Father of Curses and the Sitt Hakim. Chronologically, this book covers the time period immediately after The Ape Who Guards the Balance, although it was published some years later than the books that follow it chronologically.

Early life and education His father was Julio Ernesto Denegri Cornejo - his grandfather was Marco Aurelio Denegri Valega - and his mother was Leonor Santagadea Arana. He attended Colegio San Andr√©s (formerly Colegio Anglo-Peruano). He later studied Law at Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, and then Sexology and Sociology. He said that he attended several universities; however, he considered himself a \\"self-taught polymath\\". Career During the 70s, Denegri was the editor of Revista Cient√≠fica y Art√≠stica de Cultural Sexual ‚Äì F√°scinum. Its first issue was published in April 1972. His career in Peruvian television began in 1973. From 1997 to 2000 he hosted A solas con Marco Aurelio Denegri on Cable Magico Cultural. He resigned in 2000 and then moved to TV Peru-, thanks to the aid of Jos√© Watanabe, and there he hosted a television program called La funci√≥n de la palabra, where he addressed various aspects of culture-from music to the beauty of the hands-although he considered it counter-cultural. He wrote articles for various Peruvian newspapers, which have been published in \\"De esto y de aquello\\" by Ricardo Palma University. He wrote a weekly column for El Comercio. Personal life Denegri never married and was very reserved regarding his private life. In some programs he expressed being friends with some intellectuals, although during the last years of his life he became totally isolated. His main link to the world was his assistant and maid Rosa Torres; anyone interested in speaking to Denegri had to ring her cellphone to request a telephone conversation with Denegri. After Denegri gave her permission, she connected the phone line and the person in question could communicate directly with him. During his youth he frequently visited Jir√≥n Huatica in Lima, a meeting place for prostitutes and their clients. In \\"Miscel√°nea human√≠stica\\" he drew a map of the location as he knew it. He was also a witness to peculiar sexual encounters. In one of the airings of \\"La funci√≥n de la palabra\\", he said that together with a group of people he witnessed a technical intercourse session which involved great endurance in resisting the urge to ejaculate. Denegri related that he saw a male prostitute enduring 45 minutes of passive oral sex without ejaculating. Furthermore, in an interview conducted by journalist Ra√∫l Tola, Denegri said that he attended an ejaculation contest which consisted in ejaculating up to the farthest distance. Amused by his story, Tola asked him where could one find such contests, to which Denegri only replied that several such contests exist. He was an audiophile and music lover and a Peruvian caj√≥n lover; for this reason he introduced the term cajon√≠stica to refer to the art of African-Peruvian caj√≥n playing. Death He died on July 27, 2018 due to pulmonary emphysema. Works * F√°scinum. Ensayos sexol√≥gicos. Palabras preliminares de Carlos Alberto Segu√≠n.

It has been reissued in numerous different formats since its first release. It spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart, and was the first of two Christmas-themed albums Presley would record, the other being Elvis Sings the Wonderful World of Christmas, released in 1971. The publication Music Vendor listed Elvis' Christmas Album on their singles charts for two weeks in December 1957 ‚Äì January 1958, with a peak position of No. 49. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Elvis' Christmas Album along with its reissues has shipped at least 17 million copies in the United States. It is the first Presley title to attain Diamond certification by the RIAA, and is also the best-selling Christmas album of all time in the United States. With total sales of more 20 million copies worldwide, it remains the world's best-selling Christmas album and one of the best-selling albums of all time. Content The original 1957 LP consisted of six popular Christmas songs, two traditional Christmas carols and four gospel songs which had been previously released on the EP Peace in the Valley, catalogue EPA 4054, issued March 1957, peaking at No. 3 on the Pop albums chart and at No. 39 on the singles chart.Guralnick, Peter. The King of Rock 'n' Roll: The Complete 50's Masters, 1992, insert booklet discography. US chart positions courtesy Billboard, compiled by Record Research. The two album sides divided into a program of secular Christmas songs on side one, with two traditional Christmas carols and the gospel numbers on side two. Those included two spirituals by innovator Thomas A. Dorsey, \\"Peace in the Valley\\" and \\"Take My Hand, Precious Lord.\\" Coincidentally, A Jolly Christmas from Frank Sinatra, released the previous month, was also divided into secular and traditional sides. While most of the songs selected were traditional Christmas fare, such as \\"White Christmas\\" and \\"Silent Night,\\" two new songs by regular suppliers of material for Presley were commissioned. One was \\"Santa Bring My Baby Back (to Me)\\" and the other (selected by Presley to open the album), was a blues-based rock and roll number, \\"Santa Claus Is Back in Town,\\" written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. This writer/producer team was responsible for some of 1950s rhythm and blues and rock and roll's most finely-honed satire in their work with the Coasters, as well as penning \\"Hound Dog\\" for Willie Mae Thornton and providing Presley with some of his biggest hits, including \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" and \\"Don't.\\" Presley asked the pair to come up with another Christmas song during sessions for the album; within a few minutes, they had the song written and ready for recording. Originally titled \\"Christmas Blues\\", this slyly risqu√© number is given a full-throated treatment by Presley who, aided by the gritty ensemble playing from his band, was determined to ensure that this Christmas album would not be easily ignored.Guralnick, Peter. The King of Rock 'n' Roll: The Complete 50s Masters, 1992, box set insert booklet, p.15. Much of the remaining program was performed in a more traditional manner appropriate to the solemnity of Christmas, although Presley's innate sense of occasion shone through on his left-of-centre reading of Ernest Tubb's 1949 hit, \\"Blue Christmas.\\" \\"Silent Night\\" and \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\" were arranged by Presley himself. The Bing Crosby holiday perennial \\"White Christmas,\\" which appeared every year on the Billboard charts from 1942 to 1962, became the center of controversy upon the album's release, with calls by the song's composer Irving Berlin to have the song, and the entire album, banned from radio airplay.Wolfe, Charles. Elvis Presley: If Every Day Was Like Christmas, liner notes, p.4. As the liner notes are not numbered, page 1 is deemed to be the first page of the text, with page numbers following in ascending page order. After hearing Presley's version of his song, which Berlin saw as a \\"profane parody of his cherished yuletide standard\\", he ordered his staff in New York to telephone radio stations across the United States, demanding the song be discontinued from radio play. While most US radio stations ignored Berlin's request, at least one disc jockey was fired for playing a song from the album, and most Canadian stations refused to play the album.Wolfe, Charles. Elvis Presley: If Every Day Was Like Christmas, liner notes p.7. The controversy was, ironically, fueled by Presley's performance of the song in a style mirroring the version by Clyde McPhatter's group, The Drifters, which had been a Top 10 hit on the R&B; singles chart in 1954 and 1955. Unlike Presley's recording, however, their version attracted virtually no adverse reaction, and certainly no reported opposition from Berlin. Part of the reason that The Drifters' version of \\"White Christmas\\" was less controversial was that this version was played only on black radio stations. Presley's version brought greater attention to The Drifters' version which gained prominence with its inclusion in the 1990 movie Home Alone. Packaging Original 1957 copies of Elvis' Christmas Album (LOC-1035) were issued with a red booklet- like album cover (as shown above) featuring promotional photos from Presley's third movie Jailhouse Rock. Even rarer than the cover and record itself is a gold foil price tag-shaped \\"gift giving\\" sticker attached to the shrink wrap, reading \\"TO __________, FROM _____________, ELVIS SINGS\\", followed by a list of the tracks. Original copies with the gold sticker intact on the shrink wrap have proven to be among the most valuable of Presley's albums. Adding to its already high value are limited red vinyl albums and album covers with gold print down the spine. Record labels for all original 1957 pressings are black with all-silver print, the famous RCA Victor \\"His Master's Voice\\" dog logo at the top of label, and \\"LONG 33 PLAY\\" at the bottom. 45 RPM releases The other new composition on the album, \\"Santa, Bring My Baby Back to Me\\" was paired with \\"Santa Claus Is Back In Town\\", and issued as a UK single concurrently with the album's release. The single reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart in November 1957.The King of Rock 'n' Roll: The Complete 50s Masters, 1992, discography. No singles were issued in the US until 1964, when \\"Blue Christmas\\" was paired with \\"Wooden Heart,\\" and reached No. 1 on the Billboard Christmas Singles chart; however, a pairing of \\"Blue Christmas\\" b/w \\"White Christmas\\" became a Top 20 UK hit in late 1964. \\"Santa Claus Is Back In Town\\"/\\"Blue Christmas\\" was a 1965 single release for the US market, and reached No. 4 on the Billboard Christmas Singles chart. \\"Blue Christmas\\" would re-enter the Christmas or Holiday Singles chart several times in the years that follow. Two different EPs, Elvis Sings Christmas Songs, EPA 4108 in December 1957, and Christmas with Elvis, EPA 4340 in December 1958, divided the eight Christmas numbers between them. The former topped the newly established Billboard EP Chart, while the latter failed to chart. Reissues =First reissue on RCA Victor= Elvis' Christmas Album was reissued two years after its first release in October 1959 while Presley was on duty in Germany. The deluxe fold-out cover was replaced with a regular cover with a close-up of Elvis as he posed against an outdoor, snowy backdrop. The album continued to reach the album charts each year until 1962, eventually selling more than three million copies in the U.S. =Second reissue on RCA Camden= In 1971, Elvis recorded a new Christmas album, Elvis Sings the Wonderful World of Christmas; The original Elvis' Christmas Album went out of print, but continued interest in the album prompted RCA to reissue a revised and truncated version on its budget label RCA Camden in November, 1970. This reissue replaced the four gospel tracks from the Peace in the Valley EP with the 1966 holiday single \\"If Every Day Was Like Christmas,\\" along with the 1970 non-seasonal B-side \\"Mama Liked the Roses\\", issued as the flip to Elvis's top ten single \\"The Wonder of You\\" and originating from Presley's acclaimed 1969 Memphis sessions; neither track had been available on LP format previously. With ten tracks and a shorter running time, it fit the standard for RCA's budget Camden label issues at the time. The religious and secular Christmas songs were also mixed. The initial cover of this revised version echoed that of the 1958 reissue, except a more recent photograph with Elvis wearing a blue racing jacket with two white stripes on the left was used from the set of the 1967 movie Speedway. The album was also released in the UK with an album cover that featured Elvis's face from the 1970 Camden release in a circle in the middle surrounded in white with the title and the song selections in red. The four Peace in the Valley tracks were reissued the next year on the RCA Camden compilation You'll Never Walk Alone. =Third reissue on Pickwick= During the mid-1970s, RCA leased the rights to some of its Camden recordings to the budget reissue label Pickwick Records. Pickwick reissued the 10 track Camden Christmas album in 1975 with yet another cover design, Elvis's photo from the RCA Camden version surrounded by red ribbons with holly underneath with a blue background. Before and during the holiday season after Presley's death in August 1977, the Pickwick LP was advertised and sold on television via mail order to enormous sales, later certified by the RIAA as selling in excess of ten million copies. Demand for Presley's recordings increased greatly after his death, and RCA promptly reclaimed the reissue rights to its Camden line from Pickwick. The Christmas Album was reissued in the 1980s on LP and compact disc as an RCA Special Products release on the RCA Camden label. This reissue, with its Pickwick cover art but carrying RCA logos, was in print throughout the 1990s; the track listing remained unchanged from the original 1970 RCA Camden release. =Later reissues= In 1976, the album was reissued on cassette with the title Blue Christmas; this reissue also had an alternate track listing. In 1985, the album was reissued again but with a new title, It's Christmas Time, shortly after which RCA reissued the original 1957 version of the album with a recreation of its original cover art on CD, and gatefold sleeve on LP. By the second decade of the 21st Century, It's Christmas Time had become the second biggest selling album in the series, earning a 4X Platinum certification on March 8, 2018, prompting the 1957 version to be available once again in the 2016 60 CD boxed set containing all of Presley's original RCA albums, Elvis Presley - The RCA Album Collection. In the January 5, 2019 issue of Billboard, It's Christmas Time appeared, for the first time inside the Top 40 albums amongst the Billboard 200 chart, and placing at #25. All of the above tracks are also available on several other RCA compilations of Presley's Christmas recordings, including Christmas Peace from 2003, and Elvis Christmas from 2006. All the album's songs are also included in the 1992 RCA boxed set The King of Rock 'n' Roll: The Complete 50's Masters. In late 2007, Speaker's Corner Records from Germany reissued the album on a high quality heavy vinyl pressing; this reissue also featured a reproduction of the original album cover and RCA Victor label from 1957. In addition, in 2010, a DVD was released in a series from Sony Music called The Yule Log DVD, in which the music from Elvis' Christmas Album (but without \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\") is featured with three different holiday visuals (one of them the yule log of the series' title). The original LP cover is featured on the DVD menu.

The park also has a playground, an open athletic field for sports like rugby or soccer, and athletic courts for baseball, basketball, and bocce. The park is situated in a ravine with steep slopes. Development scandal In the late 1980s, Fairbank Park became embroiled in a major political scandal. Several politicians, including City of York deputy mayor Tony Mandarano, became involved in a secret deal with land developer Lou Charles. Mandarano received more than $100,000 in bribes, and York Council member Jim Fera received $341,000; in exchange, they agreed to speak in favour of Charles's development plans during council meetings, the most prominent of which involved tearing down Fairbank Park and selling the land to Charles so that he could construct condominiums on the site. Councilwoman Frances Nunziata was instrumental in exposing the scandal, which resulted in six of the eight council members losing their seats in the 1991 election. Mandarano received a sentence of 15 months in prison in a plea bargain, while Fera accepted an 18-month sentence in a similar deal. The decision to sell part of the park before redesignating the land for residential development was illegal, as it did not follow the City of York's Official Plan. In addition, the public input on the proposed project was limited and the public's support of the new condominiums was debatable.

The sketch is one of many to include Jack Mitchell the swagman as its main character and narrator. The story concerns a rooster that Mitchell's family once owned, named Bill, who was unknowingly ventriloquistic and always yearning to fight other roosters. Plot summary The story begins with Mitchell reminiscing about the first time a cousin noticed that Bill the rooster was a ventriloquist. Not even Bill himself recognised his own peculiar skill, and he always \\"thought it was another rooster challenging him, and he wanted badly to find that other bird.\\" When Mitchell's neighbour, an Irishman named Page, brings home a big white rooster, the two birds become involved in a vicious cock-fight. Though Bill emerges victorious, Page announces that it was \\"a grand foight\\" and bears no malice, yet he is then constantly on the lookout for a fighting-cock that may topple Bill. Page borrows an experienced game-bird from town. Page and Mitchell's father agree on a fight, and Mitchell is forbidden to attend. Mitchell scales a tree and watches the fight unfold over a fence. Jim, the more experienced bird, runs Bill in circles for a whole hour until the large rooster can no longer move.

Since the mid-20th century, the term \\"social science\\" has come to refer more generally, not just to sociology, but to all those disciplines which analyze society and culture; from anthropology to linguistics to media studies. The idea that society may be studied in a standardized and objective manner, with scholarly rules and methodology, is comparatively recent. While there is evidence of early sociology in medieval Islam, and while philosophers such as Confucius had long since theorised on topics such as social roles, the scientific analysis of \\"Man\\" is peculiar to the intellectual break away from the Age of Enlightenment and toward the discourses of Modernity. Social sciences came forth from the moral philosophy of the time and was influenced by the Age of Revolutions, such as the Industrial revolution and the French revolution.Adam Kuper and Jessica Kuper, The Social Science Encyclopedia (1985) The beginnings of the social sciences in the 18th century are reflected in the grand encyclopedia of Diderot, with articles from Rousseau and other pioneers. Around the start of the 20th century, Enlightenment philosophy was challenged in various quarters. After the use of classical theories since the end of the scientific revolution, various fields substituted mathematics studies for experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure. The development of social science subfields became very quantitative in methodology. Conversely, the interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behavior and social and environmental factors affecting it made many of the natural sciences interested in some aspects of social science methodology.Vessuri, Hebe. (2000). \\"Ethical Challenges for the Social Sciences on the Threshold of the 21st Century\\". Current Sociology 50, no. 1 (January): 135‚Äì150. , Social Science Ethics: A Bibliography, Sharon Stoerger MLS, MBA Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social studies of medicine, sociobiology, neuropsychology, bioeconomics and the history and sociology of science. Increasingly, quantitative and qualitative methods are being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences. In the first half of the 20th century, statistics became a free-standing discipline of applied mathematics. Statistical methods were used confidently. In the contemporary period, there continues to be little movement toward consensus on what methodology might have the power and refinement to connect a proposed \\"grand theory\\" with the various midrange theories that, with considerable success, continue to provide usable frameworks for massive, growing data banks.

He is best known for his Muqaddimah. =Modern period= = Early modern = Near the Renaissance, which began around the 14th century, Buridanus and Oresmius wrote on money. In the 15th century St. Atonine of Florence wrote of a comprehensive economic process. In the 16th century Leonard de Leys (Lessius), Juan de Lego, and particularly Luis Molina wrote on economic topics. These writers focused on explaining property as something for \\"public good\\". Representative figures of the 17th century include David Hartley, Hugo Grotius, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Samuel von Putendorf. Thomas Hobbes argued that deductive reasoning from axioms created a scientific framework, and hence his Leviathan was a scientific description of a political commonwealth. In the 18th century, social science was called moral philosophy, as contrasted from natural philosophy and mathematics, and included the study of natural theology, natural ethics, natural jurisprudence, and policy (\\"police\\"), which included economics and finance (\\"revenue\\"). Pure philosophy, logic, literature, and history were outside these two categories. Adam Smith was a professor of moral philosophy, and he was taught by Francis Hutcheson. Figures of the time included Fran√ßois Quesnay, Rousseau, Giambattista Vico, William Godwin, Gabriel Bonnet de Mably, and Andre Morellet. The Encyclop√©die of the time contained various works on the social sciences. = Late modern = This unity of science as descriptive remains, for example, in the time of Thomas Hobbes who argued that deductive reasoning from axioms created a scientific framework, and hence his Leviathan was a scientific description of a political commonwealth. What would happen within decades of his work was a revolution in what constituted \\"science\\", particularly the work of Isaac Newton in physics. Newton, by revolutionizing what was then called \\"natural philosophy\\", changed the basic framework by which individuals understood what was \\"scientific\\". While he was merely the archetype of an accelerating trend, the important distinction is that for Newton, the mathematical flowed from a presumed reality independent of the observer, and working by its own rules. For philosophers of the same period, mathematical expression of philosophical ideals was taken to be symbolic of natural human relationships as well: the same laws moved physical and spiritual reality. For examples see Blaise Pascal, Gottfried Leibniz and Johannes Kepler, each of whom took mathematical examples as models for human behavior directly. In Pascal's case, the famous wager; for Leibniz, the invention of binary computation; and for Kepler, the intervention of angels to guide the planets (citation needed). In the realm of other disciplines, this created a pressure to express ideas in the form of mathematical relationships. Such relationships, called \\"Laws\\" after the usage of the time (see philosophy of science) became the model which other disciplines would emulate.  19th century  The term \\"social science\\" first appeared in the 1824 book An Inquiry into the Principles of the Distribution of Wealth Most Conducive to Human Happiness; applied to the Newly Proposed System of Voluntary Equality of Wealth by William Thompson (1775‚Äì1833). Auguste Comte (1797‚Äì1857) argued that ideas pass through three rising stages, theological, philosophical and scientific. He defined the difference as the first being rooted in assumption, the second in critical thinking, and the third in positive observation. This framework, still rejected by many, encapsulates the thinking which was to push economic study from being a descriptive to a mathematically based discipline. Karl Marx was one of the first writers to claim that his methods of research represented a scientific view of history in this model. With the late 19th century, attempts to apply equations to statements about human behavior became increasingly common. Among the first were the \\"Laws\\" of philology, which attempted to map the change over time of sounds in a language. Sociology was established by Comte in 1838.A Dictionary of Sociology, Article: Comte, Auguste He had earlier used the term \\"social physics\\", but that had subsequently been appropriated by others, most notably the Belgian statistician Adolphe Quetelet. Comte endeavoured to unify history, psychology and economics through the scientific understanding of the social realm. Writing shortly after the malaise of the French Revolution, he proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological positivism, an epistemological approach outlined in The Course in Positive Philosophy [1830‚Äì1842] and A General View of Positivism (1844). Comte believed a positivist stage would mark the final era, after conjectural theological and metaphysical phases, in the progression of human understanding.Dictionary of the Social Sciences, Article: Comte, Auguste It was with the work of Charles Darwin that the descriptive version of social theory received another shock. Biology had, seemingly, resisted mathematical study, and yet the theory of natural selection and the implied idea of genetic inheritance‚Äîlater found to have been enunciated by Gregor Mendel, seemed to point in the direction of a scientific biology based, like physics and chemistry, on mathematical relationships. The first thinkers to attempt to combine inquiry of the type they saw in Darwin with exploration of human relationships, which, evolutionary theory implied, would be based on selective forces, were Freud in Austria and William James in the United States. Freud's theory of the functioning of the mind, and James' work on experimental psychology would have enormous impact on those that followed. Freud, in particular, created a framework which would appeal not only to those studying psychology, but artists and writers as well. Though Comte is generally regarded as the \\"Father of Sociology\\", the discipline was formally established by another French thinker, √âmile Durkheim (1858‚Äì1917), who developed positivism in greater detail. Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux in 1895, publishing his Rules of the Sociological Method. In 1896, he established the journal L'Ann√©e Sociologique. Durkheim's seminal monograph, Suicide (1897), a case study of suicide rates among Catholic and Protestant populations, distinguished sociological analysis from psychology or philosophy. It also marked a major contribution to the concept of structural functionalism.Gianfranco Poggi (2000). Durkheim. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Chapter 1. Today, Durkheim, Marx and Max Weber are typically cited as the three principal architects of social science in the science of society sense of the term.http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weber/ \\"Max Weber\\". Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy \\"Social science\\", however, has since become an umbrella term to describe all those disciplines, outside of physical science and art, which analyse human societies.  20th century  In the first half of the 20th century, statistics became a free-standing discipline of applied mathematics. Statistical methods were used confidently, for example in an increasingly statistical view of biology. The first thinkers to attempt to combine inquiry of the type they saw in Darwin with exploration of human relationships, which, evolutionary theory implied, would be based on selective forces, were Freud in Austria and William James in the United States. Freud's theory of the functioning of the mind, and James' work on experimental psychology would have enormous impact on those that followed. Freud, in particular, created a framework which would appeal not only to those studying psychology, but artists and writers as well. One of the most persuasive advocates for the view of scientific treatment of philosophy would be John Dewey (1859‚Äì1952). He began, as Marx did, in an attempt to weld Hegelian idealism and logic to experimental science, for example in his Psychology of 1887. However, he abandoned Hegelian constructs. Influenced by both Charles Sanders Peirce and William James, he joined the movement in America called pragmatism. He then formulated his basic doctrine, enunciated in essays such as \\"The Influence of Darwin on Philosophy\\" (1910). This idea, based on his theory of how organisms respond, states that there are three phases to the process of inquiry: # Problematic Situation, where the typical response is inadequate. # Isolation of Data or subject matter. # Reflective, which is tested empirically. With the rise of the idea of quantitative measurement in the physical sciences, for example Lord Rutherford's famous maxim that any knowledge that one cannot measure numerically \\"is a poor sort of knowledge\\", the stage was set for the conception of the humanities as being precursors to \\"social science.\\" This change was not, and is not, without its detractors, both inside of academia and outside. The range of critiques begin from those who believe that the physical sciences are qualitatively different from social sciences, through those who do not believe in statistical science of any kind, through those who disagree with the methodology and kinds of conclusion of social science, to those who believe the entire framework of scientificizing these disciplines is mostly from a desire for prestige. In 1924, prominent social scientists established the Pi Gamma Mu honor society for the social sciences. Among its key objectives were to promote interdisciplinary cooperation and develop an integrated theory of human personality and organization. Toward these ends, a journal for interdisciplinary scholarship in the various social sciences and lectureship grants were established.  Interwar period  Theodore Porter argued in The Rise of Statistical Thinking that the effort to provide a synthetic social science is a matter of both administration and discovery combined, and that the rise of social science was, therefore, marked by both pragmatic needs as much as by theoretical purity. An example of this is the rise of the concept of Intelligence Quotient, or IQ. It is unclear precisely what is being measured by IQ, but the measurement is useful in that it predicts success in various endeavors. The rise of industrialism had created a series of social, economic, and political problems, particularly in managing supply and demand in their political economy, the management of resources for military and developmental use, the creation of mass education systems to train individuals in symbolic reasoning and problems in managing the effects of industrialization itself. The perceived senselessness of the \\"Great War\\" as it was then called, of 1914‚Äì18, now called World War I, based in what were perceived to be \\"emotional\\" and \\"irrational\\" decisions, provided an immediate impetus for a form of decision making that was more \\"scientific\\" and easier to manage. Simply put, to manage the new multi-national enterprises, private and governmental, required more data. More data required a means of reducing it to information upon which to make decisions. Numbers and charts could be interpreted more quickly and moved more efficiently than long texts. Conversely, the interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behavior and social and environmental factors affecting it have made many of the so-called hard sciences dependent on social science methodology. Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social studies of medicine, neuropsychology, bioeconomics and the history and sociology of science. Increasingly, quantitative and qualitative methods are being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences. In the 1930s this new model of managing decision making became cemented with the New Deal in the US, and in Europe with the increasing need to manage industrial production and governmental affairs. Institutions such as The New School for Social Research, International Institute of Social History, and departments of \\"social research\\" at prestigious universities were meant to fill the growing demand for individuals who could quantify human interactions and produce models for decision making on this basis. Coupled with this pragmatic need was the belief that the clarity and simplicity of mathematical expression avoided systematic errors of holistic thinking and logic rooted in traditional argument. This trend, part of the larger movement known as modernism provided the rhetorical edge for the expansion of social sciences. = Contemporary developments = There continues to be little movement toward consensus on what methodology might have the power and refinement to connect a proposed \\"grand theory\\" with the various midrange theories which, with considerable success, continue to provide usable frameworks for massive, growing data banks (see consilience).Clifford Geertz, \\"Empowering Aristotle\\", Science, vol. 293, July 6, 2001, p. 53.

It is a resident breeding species from southwest Mexico to northwestern Costa Rica. This large wren breeds in lowlands and foothills from sea level up to altitude in forest or open woodland, scrub, second growth and savanna. It is found mainly on the Pacific side of the central mountain ranges. Its spherical nest has a side entrance and is lined with seed down. It is constructed high in thorny trees or shrubs, especially bull's-horn acacia. This species sometimes nests close to the nests of wasps and there is experimental evidence that those that do so are afforded substantial protection from predation by doing so. The female alone incubates the three to five brown- or black-spotted white eggs for about two weeks until hatching, and the young fledge after about the same length of time again. After breeding, families sleep together in dormitory nests like those used for breeding. in Guanacaste province, Costa Rica The adult rufous- backed wren is long and weighs . It has a black crown and eyestripe separated by a strong white supercilium, a rufous nape, and cinnamon-brown upperparts streaked with black and white, especially on the rump. The wings and tail are barred with black and greyish-white. The underparts are white. Young birds have duller upperparts and buff underparts. This species has a short rasping call. The song is a mix of rich whistles, chatters and gurgles often given as a duet. The rufous-naped wren forages actively in low vegetation in pairs or family groups. It eats mainly insects, spiders and other invertebrates. This species is often tame and inquisitive. Three main populations vary markedly in size and coloration, and now represent separate species: Veracruz wren (restricted to central coastal Veracruz), Sclater's wren (north and west from western Chiapas), and rufous-backed wren (south and east from western Chiapas).

Pillai found that the Nair community was beset with many unnecessary customs and traditions that prevented the groups progress. He tried to stop the celebration of such extravagant and ridiculous ceremonies like Thalikettu, Therandu Kalyaanam, Pulikudi, etc. He campaigned for the discontinuation of the out-dated matrilineal system observed by the Nairs. He initiated the Smastha Kerala Nair Samajam meetings for this purpose. He started a monthly newspaper called Samudaya Parishkarini. Pillai paved the way for the formation of the Nair Service Society in 1914. He did not survive to witness the growth and development of the society.

That is, if :k[x_1, x_2,\\\\ldots, x_n] is a polynomial ring, the ring of radical polynomials is the subring generated by the polynomial :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2. Radical polynomials are characterized as precisely those polynomials that are invariant under the action of the orthogonal group. The ring of radical polynomials is a graded subalgebra of the ring of all polynomials. The standard separation of variables theorem asserts that every polynomial can be expressed as a finite sum of terms, each term being a product of a radical polynomial and a harmonic polynomial.

He was active in central France, mainly Chartres, and was one of the composers listed by Eloy d'Amerval in his long 1508 poem Le livre de la deablerie as one of the great composers of the age, resident in Paradise ‚Äì even though he was still alive. While he probably wrote a substantial number of works, only four secular compositions survive.  Life  Nothing is known about his origin, but he first appears in the cathedral of Chartres as a boy singer in 1462. He became choirmaster of the boys in the Chartres choir school in 1469, which makes a birthdate of 1450 a fair approximation. In 1472 he became a canon. Between March and November 1483 he made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, being replaced in his duties at Chartres by the young Antoine Brumel (this is the earliest mention of this renowned composer). The following year Mureau made another pilgrimage, this one to Santiago de Compostela. Details of his subsequent career are spotty, and he may have remained in Chartres or the general area. He evidently knew many of the prominent composers in central France around the turn of the 16th century. Johannes Tinctoris and Johannes Ockeghem are two he certainly knew personally, as the former was also associated with Chartres, and Ockeghem was at Tours, the church of which was closely connected with Chartres. An obituary for Mureau is recorded in Chartres in July 1512.  Music  Only four pieces by Mureau survive, all rondeaux. They are found in various sources, including Petrucci's famous Odhecaton. They are typical of the refined French secular music of the late 15th century, with balanced phrases, careful attention to melody and clear delineation of the text; some brief portions use imitation.

South Park Studio's use of computer animation allows it to edit episodes in days, quickly commenting on recent events, including Eli√°n Gonz√°lez, 2000 U.S. presidential election, the capture of Saddam Hussein, and the election of Barack Obama/Donald Trump. The creators also have engendered a mix of socially liberal and fiscally conservative viewpoints, espousing a libertarian ideology in both real life and on the show. However, the show's creators call themselves \\"equal opportunity offenders\\", and reject the notion that they are trying to put forth any consistent ideological agenda through the show. List =Abortion= Abortion is heavily lampooned in South Park. * \\"Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut\\": Cartman's Mom attempted to get her son a \\"42nd trimester\\" abortion, and finds out that such a late abortion is illegal, she says \\"Well, I think you need to keep your laws off of my body.\\" Later in the episode, Mrs Cartman says \\"I should've thought of raising a child before having sex.\\" She was later informed that she confused the word \\"abortion\\" with \\"adoption\\". * \\"Cartman Joins NAMBLA\\": Upon learning that his parents want to have another child, Kenny attempts to prevent the event of having a younger sibling. He attempts to give his mother morning-after abortion pills, tries to get her to drink liquor and encourages her to ride on an intense amusement park attraction in order to provoke a miscarriage. None of his attempts work, however, leaving the newborn child to become a miniature reincarnation of Kenny himself. * \\"Chef Goes Nanners\\": The substitute teacher shows that the class had participated in different debates, with one being \\"Pro-Choice vs. Cartman\\". * \\"Kenny Dies\\": Cartman attempts to get stem cell research (using aborted fetuses) legalized in a feigned attempt to save Kenny's life. It is revealed at the end of the episode he really wanted to use stem cells to clone his favorite pizza restaurant. * \\"A Ladder to Heaven\\": Upon realizing that Kenny's soul is inside his body, Cartman decides to go somewhere where they \\"remove living souls from inside\\" of him. He then proceeds to go to an abortion clinic where he gets into an argument with the lady at the counter, stating that he can't live this way and demanding that they just suck Kenny's soul out. A couple walk in and upon hearing Cartman's rant, the girlfriend states that she \\"can't do this\\" and runs out. At that point, the visibly angry boyfriend throws a rock at Cartman. * \\"Woodland Critter Christmas\\": The mountain lion cubs are taught at an abortion clinic how to stop the Antichrist porcupine from being born. During the episode's final confrontation, they give Kyle an \\"abortion\\", expelling the Antichrist from his body so that Santa can crush it with a sledgehammer. * \\"Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina\\": The newly sex-changed Mrs. Garrison becomes convinced she is pregnant because she doesn't start menstruating. She asks the doctor whether he would \\"vacuum it (the fetus) out or scramble its brains\\" because \\"a woman can do whatever she wants with her body,\\" only to find out at the abortion clinic that uteruses are not created in sex change operations; therefore she cannot get pregnant. * \\"Eek, a Penis!\\": Cartman spends most of the episode teaching inner-city kids that it is okay to cheat. In counseling a pregnant teenager, he says that \\"Abortion isn't wrong...abortion is the ultimate form of cheating. You're cheating nature itself. Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortions when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly out of a chance at life.\\" * South Park: The Stick of Truth: A section of the game takes place in the abortion clinic, named Unplanned Parenthood, as the New Kid goes undercover dressing as a girl to recover a girl's abortion records for Wendy's crew. Along the way, he has to perform an \\"abortion\\" on Randy Marsh in disguise to fool the government agents and deal with an outbreak of Nazi Zombie Fetuses that overrun the clinic. This section was censored in the release of the game in certain regions. =Celebrities= * Barbra Streisand: in \\"Mecha- Streisand\\", \\"200\\", and \\"201\\", she gains evil-powers and destroys the town as a Mechagodzilla-style creature; in \\"Spookyfish\\", different visages from her TV and film work appear as \\"Spooky Streisand\\" sidebars. Her name also seems to be something of a curse word in the South Park universe, as in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut and \\"Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants.\\" * \\"Starvin' Marvin\\" and \\"Starvin' Marvin in Space\\" lampoon the charity efforts of Sally Struthers, who appears as a Jabba the Hutt figure in the latter episode. * Dr. Oz: in \\"Butterballs (South Park)\\", Dr. Oz spouts false medical babble and bullies Butters while interviewing him about the anti-bullying video he is starring in. * \\"Butters' Very Own Episode\\": The parents of Butters Stotch try to conceal Butters' mother's attempted murder of their son with the help of Gary Condit, O. J. Simpson, and the parents of JonBen√©t Ramsey. * \\"Fat Butt and Pancake Head\\": Cartman makes a Jennifer Lopez hand puppet, which suddenly develops a personality of its own and becomes a singing sensation. As a result, the real J-Lo is fired from her record label and Ben Affleck falls in love with the hand puppet. * Affleck, prior to \\"Fat Butt and Pancake Head\\", also appears in \\"How to Eat with Your Butt\\", where it is revealed that he is the long-lost son of a couple suffering from a fictitious congenital condition called \\"torsonic polarity syndrome\\" (TPS), which causes victims to appear to have buttocks in place of their face. * Rob Reiner is derided as a hypocritical activist who works to outlaw smoking in public places for reasons of health, despite the fact that he is obese on account of poor dietary habits, in \\"Butt Out\\". His obesity hits home whenever he needs butter to get out of tight places such as a car. * John Edward's mentalist/medium practices are criticized in \\"The Biggest Douche in the Universe\\". * Jared Fogle is satirized in \\"Jared Has Aides\\": a play on his use of personal trainers in the episode. He also appeared in the episode \\"Stunning and Brave\\". * Russell Crowe is playfully mocked for his Gladiator role and his violent fights in \\"The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer\\". * \\"The Biggest Douche in the Universe\\": Rob Schneider is shown in four movie previews. The previews depict Schneider transforming into a stapler, a carrot, and Kenny McCormick. One of the previews is more like a template with often used phrases \\"Until one day\\", \\"From the creators of\\", and \\"Rob Schneider is\\" between which it's filled with nonsensical gibberish. Schneider is shown dancing in a discoth√®que, walking into a lamp post, drinking some liquid in a laboratory, and falling down stairs. * Mel Gibson is the subject of Cartman's admiration after Cartman watches Gibson's film, The Passion of the Christ, culminating in \\"The Passion of the Jew\\", wherein Gibson responds to Stan and Kenny's demand for a refund of the money they spent on The Passion by masochistic tendencies with which he accuses Stan and Kenny of threatening to torture him, and by chasing after the two after they steal the money from his home. He later defecates on Cartman and smears his feces on a South Park building, ruining his standing with Cartman and his Christian South Park fans. He later appears in the \\"Imaginationland Episode III\\", in which he provides story ideas to the United States government, in order to inspire a possible avenue of investigation into the invasion of Imaginationland. Despite his bizarre, erratic behavior, the Pentagon officials observe, his experience as a director and his understanding of story structure actually provide a useful idea, where previous directors consulted, Michael Bay and M. Night Shyamalan, merely suggested special effects and plot twists. * Michael Jackson is portrayed with the character \\"Mr. Jefferson\\" in the episode \\"The Jeffersons\\", in which he moves to South Park with his son Blanket to a house full of arcade games and animals, inevitably attracting all the kids in the town. * Jackson is later parodied in the season 13 episode \\"Dead Celebrities\\" as a ghost possessing Ike because of his denial of being dead, being a man, being an adult and being black. ** \\"Dead Celebrities\\" also featured Billy Mays, Ed McMahon, Farrah Fawcett, Patrick Swayze, Walter Cronkite, Dom DeLuise, Ted Kennedy, Natasha Richardson, Bea Arthur, David Carradine, DJ AM, Ricardo Montalb√°n, and Steve McNair as celebrities trapped in purgatory, which is like being in a plane on the tarmac, because Michael Jackson refuses to acknowledge his death. ** The Boys get help from Ghost Hunters co-stars Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson in the same episode. * Paris Hilton is caricatured as a \\"skank\\" in \\"Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset\\". The episode implies (and in some cases explicitly states) that Paris Hilton is a stupid, spoiled, drunken whore who has done nothing to deserve her fame except being rich and spoiled. The episode also criticizes how she has become a role model for young girls (the girls of South Park, with the exception of Wendy Testaburger, quickly take up her supposedly promiscuous and mindless attitude towards life after the opening of the \\"Stupid spoiled whore\\" shop). * Tom Cruise and John Travolta are famously caricatured in \\"Trapped in the Closet\\" for their participation in Scientology. This episode resulted in the departure of Isaac Hayes as Chef in \\"The Return of Chef\\", where Chef is brainwashed into a made-up organization lampooning Scientology (of which Hayes is a member, and claimed religious insult because of \\"Closet\\"). The title of the \\"Closet\\" episode references \\"Trapped in the Closet\\" by R. Kelly, who is also a participant in \\"Closet.\\" * Prior to \\"Trapped in the Closet\\", Travolta was featured in \\"The Entity\\", demonstrating Mr. Garrison's mono-wheel vehicle known as \\"IT.\\" * George Clooney is considered a source of \\"smug\\" in \\"Smug Alert!\\" for his speech giving Hollywood credit in the American Civil Rights Movement, and in the movie for the doctor. * \\"Super Best Friends\\": David Blaine is the leader of a cult known as \\"Blaintology\\". * \\"Red Hot Catholic Love\\": Martha Stewart uses Cartman's method of digestion (which involves shoving food up the anus and defecating out the mouth) to eat a whole turkey. * \\"Here Comes the Neighborhood\\": Token convinces rich African-American celebrities such as Will Smith, Oprah Winfrey, Sean Combs and Bill Cosby (who is shown having an obsession with Jell-O pudding) to move to South Park. Oprah also makes an appearance on the episode \\"A Million Little Fibers\\", where she talks about selecting Towelie's memoirs as her book of the month. * U.S. Army troops mistake a goat for Fleetwood Mac lead vocalist Stevie Nicks in the episode \\"Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants\\". * \\"Tsst\\": Cesar Millan from the show Dog Whisperer is brought in to discipline Cartman after Nanny 911 and Supernanny fail. * Al Gore is satirized in the episode \\"ManBearPig\\", where he warns the town of South Park about a terrible creature that is \\"half-man, half-bear and half-pig.\\" * Both are further explored in Season 22 as both Gore and ManBearPig return. Gore becomes a friend of the boys as they try to defeat the monster. * \\"Ginger Kids\\": When Cartman presents his report about red-haired, pale-skin, freckled people, his slideshow displays pictures of Carrot Top and Ron Howard. * The Fab Five from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy are parodied as Crab People in the episode \\"South Park Is Gay!\\". * \\"The Snuke\\": Hillary Clinton has a nuclear weapon in her vagina. * \\"Britney's New Look\\": Britney Spears' popularity is due to her being a sacrifice for corn Harvest. * Both Taylor Swifting and Faith Hilling were parodied in South Park. * \\"About Last Night...\\": Barack Obama, John McCain, Sarah Palin, and Michelle Obama are members of an elite team of professional thieves after the Hope Diamond. * Bono is parodied in the episode \\"More Crap\\", which highlights his humanitarian efforts, coupled with his pretentious, often narcissistic personality. It's revealed that he is actually a world-record setting \\"piece of crap\\"; Stan explains: \\"That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit.\\" Measurements in the episode are measured in Courics. * \\"Imaginationland Episode II\\": Kurt Russell is depicted making fun of the film Stargate. He goes into the imagination portal where he is raped by Cartman's made-up forest critters. * \\"The Ring\\": The Jonas Brothers are part of an evil plot by Mickey Mouse, unbeknownst to The Jonas Brothers, to help Mickey Mouse sell sex to young girls. * \\"Sexual Healing\\": Instead of claiming responsibility for the sex scandals, various celebrities such as Michael Douglas, Michael Jordan, Ben Roethlisberger, David Duchovny, Charlie Sheen, David Letterman, Bill Clinton, Billy Bob Thornton, Kobe Bryant, Elliot Spitzer, and Tiger Woods use excuses such as sex addiction cast on them by an \\"Alien Wizard\\" to justify their own actions. * \\"Prehistoric Ice Man\\": Marilyn Manson is performing a song called \\"Stinky Britches\\" on a TV in a shop before Larry angrily smashes the glass and the TV. *Caitlyn Jenner was mocked in several episodes of the nineteenth season, with many episodes referencing Jenner's hit-and-run accident (by showing Jenner driving over numerous people). =Censorship= The primary subject of South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is censorship, also a repeatedly cited concern in multiple episodes. Notable episodes involving censorship include \\"Death\\", \\"It Hits the Fan\\", \\"Cartoon Wars Part I\\", \\"Cartoon Wars Part II\\", \\"200\\", \\"201\\", and \\"Band in China\\". * \\"Cartoon Wars Part II\\": Cartman wishes the President a major news corporation to prevent an episode of Family Guy from airing, and to prevent Kyle from interfering with his plan, Cartman states, \\"okay, I'll make it easy for you\\", and pulls out a gun and aims it at the President. When the President responds with, \\"okay, I'll listen to you\\", Kyle states to the President, \\"you can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!\\" When the president then responds with, \\"I can't be responsible for people getting hurt. Especially me\\", Kyle states, \\"yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that... you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here\\". =Drugs= * \\"Ike's Wee Wee\\": Mr. Mackey is forced out of his job for losing a marijuana bud in a drug-education class. Ironically, he goes through a cycle of experimentation (ending up in his adopting hippie ideology and happily marrying a woman he meets), before an enforced treatment (after being captured during his honeymoon in India by the A-Team, no less) and reverting to his position as a spokesman against drugs. * \\"My Future Self n' Me\\": Stan and Butters' parents find an indirect and strange way to try to prevent their children from using drugs. They hire representatives to act as though they were future versions of the children, who travel back in time to tell them how the use of drugs has made their lives miserable. While the episode does condemn the use of drugs, it parodies the tendency of people (especially parents) to overreact to the substances and deceive their children to ensure their safety. * \\"Towelie\\" and \\"A Million Little Fibers\\": Towelie is forced to confront his marijuana addiction in times of crisis, eventually coming to the \\"conclusion\\" that he should only partake in drug use when he accomplishes something good, not in order to. ** Towelie later puts his marijuana addiction to good use as he is a state government inspector that approves and later works at Randy Marsh's marijuana farm in Season 22. * \\"Up the Down Steroid\\": Jimmy Valmer is chronicled through his use of steroids; combines the subject of performance-enhancing drug controversy frequently seen in baseball and other sports with a Lifestories: Families in Crisis episode about steroid use. * \\"Die Hippie, Die\\": The hippies have their Jamfest in South Park to \\"Stop Corporations\\" and Kenny, Kyle and Stan join the hippies. In the end, the boys realize the hippies smoke way too much pot and are just as selfish as the corporations they complain about by trying to forget about their troubles when they don't have any. * \\"Major Boobage\\": Kids across the nation, particularly Kenny, have found a new way to get high. The episode references the glue- sniffing, paint snorting, and marker sniffing epidemics. * \\"Quest for Ratings\\" To get ideas for South Park Elementary's closed-circuit television system, the boys decide to get high on cough medicine. Remembering that they had seen Craig's program while high and thought it to be brilliant, they conclude that a majority of the school must be perpetually high on cough medicine, accounting for his ratings. They then decide to produce a special report that gets cough medicine banned from school. * \\"Medicinal Fried Chicken\\": Medical marijuana becomes legal while KFC is portrayed as a newly illegal addictive drug, featuring a Cartman subplot that parodies the film Scarface. * \\"Best Friends Forever\\": An archangel presenting a battle strategy to Kenny on a whiteboard while casually sniffing the marker he's using. * \\"Guitar Queer-O\\": Stan plays a video game called \\"Heroin Hero\\", in which the only objective was to shoot up heroin and chase a dragon around. * \\"Hummels & Heroin\\": When a number of costumed characters begin to overdose on painkillers at children's birthday parties, Stan discovers that the drugs are being trafficked out of Grandpa Marsh's nursing home, stored inside German Hummels. The episode parodies the growing opioid epidemic, while also comparing retirement homes to prisons. * \\"Tegridy Farms\\": Randy and Sharon move out to a cannabis farm, where he harvests the plant and manufactures a variety of products from hemp. =Environmentalism and global warming= * \\"Rainforest Shmainforest\\" parodies environmental activism and portrays celebrity environmental activism as motivated by a desire to feel better about themselves. * \\"Spontaneous Combustion\\" uses global warming as a source of trouble for the townspeople, caused by their own flatulence. * \\"Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow\\" and \\"ManBearPig\\" make fun of overreactions and doomsday predictions concerning global warming. \\"Two Days...\\" also mocks the government's response in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, while \\"ManBearPig\\" is more specifically a mockery of Al Gore. * \\"Smug Alert!\\": Hybrid automobiles, while praised, nonetheless have owners who are touted as a source of \\"smug\\" (caused by the incredible selfish and self-centered behavior of their owners); San Francisco is considered as the \\"smug\\" capital, destroyed in a \\"smug-storm\\" √† la The Perfect Storm. The \\"smug-storm\\" was represented by an Oscar Acceptance speech given by George Clooney a few weeks before the episode originally aired. * In \\"Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow\\" Earth Day people come to South Park. The Earth Day people utilize a jedi mind trick to make the townspeople not only believe that all they say is correct, while that which conservatives say is slander, but to also build for them a massive Earth Day celebration. When Stan says \\"My dad is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming\\", they answer \\"That's not true, global warming is going to kill us all. The Republicans are responsible\\". * In \\"Time to Get Cereal\\" and \\"Nobody Got Cereal?\\", after ManBearPig comes to South Park and goes on a murderous rampage, the boys seek out Al Gore to help stop him. ManBearPig serves as a metaphor for the devastating effects climate change, while the town's indifferent reaction parodies the views of climate change deniers. Some critics have suggested that Parker & Stone made the episodes as an \\"apology\\" to Gore for mocking him in the past. * \\"Whale Whores\\" addresses the subject matter of Japanese whaling. =Homosexuality and gay marriage= * Big Gay Al is used in several episodes and the movie to promote tolerance and acceptance for homosexuals. * Mr. Garrison later comes out as gay for several seasons, and lives with Mr. Slave until he undergoes a sex change operation in \\"Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina\\". After the sex change, \\"Mrs. Garrison\\" briefly becomes a lesbian in \\"D-Yikes!\\". *Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave are later married in \\"Follow That Egg!\\". South Park parodies the real-life \\"civil union\\" compromise by proposing gay couples be allowed to have the same rights as married groups, but be called \\"butt buddies\\". * The 2007 episode \\"Cartman Sucks\\" parodied and criticized the ex-gay movement, focusing on children whose parents force them to attend conversion therapy. * Stan's dog 'Sparky', who is voiced by George Clooney, is gay, and humps other male dogs in \\"Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride\\". * In \\"The F Word\\", the word fag is used quite satirically to reference middle-aged men who ride Harley-Davidsons and even the homosexuals petition for the word's definition to be changed from meaning homosexuals to middle-aged bikies. * In \\"Trapped In the Closet\\", many references are made about the rumors of Tom Cruise being gay. He locks himself in Stan's bedroom closet and the characters say \\"Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.\\" John Travolta and R. Kelly also join in. =Literature= * In \\"Chickenlover\\", Officer Barbrady is forced to confront his illiteracy while attempting to solve the case of the \\"chickenlover\\", a man who goes around having sex with local chickens. In the end, it's revealed that the \\"chickenlover\\" is the owner of a local bookmobile, whose motive was to help Barbrady learn to read by leaving clues in book passages. He gives him a copy of Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand, which Barbrady reads and decries, \\"I read every last word of this garbage and because of this piece of SHIT, I'm never reading again!\\" * In \\"A Ladder to Heaven\\", kittylitter is a collection of books. * In \\"Timmy 2000\\", a doctor diagnoses Timmy and the other children with ADD by reading them the novels The Great Gatsby and A Farewell to Arms in their entirety, then asking them a trivial question about a single passage; he deduces from their unresponsive boredom that they weren't paying attention and prescribes them all Ritalin. * In \\"Pip\\", the book Great Expectations is parodied throughout. British actor Malcolm McDowell provides narration. * In \\"Mystery of the Urinal Deuce\\", cases are solved by the \\"Hardly Boys\\", a direct parody of The Hardy Boys. * In \\"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs\\", books that (allegedly) cause the death of a major celebrity are often barred from sale, explicitly referencing the supposed role of The Catcher in the Rye in the shootings of John Lennon and Ronald Reagan. It is also a fact that if an author finds success, people will always assume that the written work contains hidden meanings. * In \\"Over Logging\\", internet access \\"dries up\\" for people across the Midwest, so Randy decides to move his family \\"out Californee way\\" in search of more. The episode is a parody of John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes of Wrath and its film adaptation. * In ‚ÄúD-Yikes!‚Äù, the boys hire Mexican day laborers to read The Old Man and the Sea and write book reports for them. The Mexicans misunderstand the request to write four ‚Äúessays‚Äù and instead write letters to their √©ses. * Every author is obsessed with receiving approval from Oprah, especially Towelie. The episode \\"A Million Little Fibers\\" spoofs the controversy surrounding author James Frey after his memoir A Million Little Pieces was lauded on The Oprah Winfrey Show and selected for Oprah's Book Club, only to later be discovered that it was largely fictionalized. =Religion= * \\"Starvin' Marvin in Space\\": Christian missionaries and Pat Robertson attempt to cajole Starvin Marvin's people and the Marklar into accepting their faith. This episode in general portrays missionaries in a rather unfavorable manner, as when the missionary character attempts to get the Africans to read the Bible. \\"Remember, reading the Bible plus accepting Jesus equals FOOD\\", suggesting that the Christians would have let the emaciated Africans starve if they did not convert. * \\"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus\\" addresses the Year 2000 hype/hysteria and introduces God (in a non-stereotypical visage) to the series. * \\"Super Best Friends\\" has the key members of the world's faiths join together to fight a cult. * Christian rock music is the subject of \\"Christian Rock Hard\\": Cartman attempts to start a Christian Rock band as a scheme to win a bet with Kyle. * \\"Red Hot Catholic Love\\" parodies the Catholic sex abuse scandal (the town's pastor is seen trying to convert other Catholic priests from molestation) and the separation of church and state as demanded by atheists; the issue of sex abuse was lampooned again in \\"A Boy and a Priest\\", which came in the wake of renewed scrutiny of the Church following an extensive Pennsylvania grand jury report. In the latter episode, the archdiocese in Denver sends three priests to South Park in order to clean up Father Mackie's mess when he is only having a non- sexual relationship with Butters. The episode involves the pastor becoming the butt of jokes by the townspeople. * Cartman Sucks features Butters' stay in a Christian conversion therapy camp, where he, completely oblivious to the euphemisms used to designate homosexuality (\\"confusion\\", \\"bi-curious\\"), witnesses suicides and the psychological pressure applied on homosexual children. The episode ends with Butters realizing that \\"If I'm bi-curious and I'm made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious too.\\" * \\"All About the Mormons?\\" chronicles the arrival of a Mormon family in South Park, and lampoons the story of Joseph Smith. Yet in conclusion to the episode, Gary, Stan's Mormon friend, tells Stan, \\"Look, maybe us Mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense, and maybe Joseph Smith did make it all up, but I have a great life. and a great family, and I have the Book of Mormon to thank for that. The truth is, I don't care if Joseph Smith made it all up, because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. And even though people in this town might think that's stupid, I still choose to believe in it. All I ever did was try to be your friend, Stan, but you're so high and mighty you couldn't look past my religion and just be my friend back. You've got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls\\". * \\"Bloody Mary\\" was criticized for its portrayal of a Virgin Mary statue as bleeding from her anus (later found out to be from her vagina, as declared by Pope Benedict XVI in the episode). It also addressed the religious origins of Alcoholics Anonymous. * \\"Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?\\" and \\"Probably\\" depicts Stan, Cartman, and Kenny being frightened by the town Priest's descriptions of hell and those who are headed there. Determined to save their souls and those of their friends, including Kyle, a Jew and Timmy, who is mentally handicapped, they seek out advice from the local clergy. When the boys find the priest having sex in the confessional, they decide to make their own church aimed at salvation. They continue this course until it is revealed that Cartman, in an obvious nod to televangelism, only did it to make ten million dollars, and Jesus shows up to bring an end to Cartman's prosperity gospel church. The episode pokes fun at charismatic evangelicals. * Scientology is the subject of \\"Trapped in the Closet\\" where Stan is declared the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. * \\"Go God Go\\" and sequel, \\"Go God Go XII\\" attempt to show that atheism can be just as radical as religion. In the future, all religion has been destroyed by Richard Dawkins and Mrs. Garrison and everyone is atheist in hopes that reason will prevent war. However, fanaticism nonetheless grows and there are several warring factions trying to decide whose logic is correct in determining their name. They also use 'Science' as an alternative to 'God' as a curse, e.g. 'Science Damn You', 'Science H Logic!'. * In \\"Fantastic Easter Special\\", the episode suggested (lampooning The Da Vinci Code) that Saint Peter was a rabbit and that God wanted all the popes to be rabbits so they would keep their mouths shut. It also villainizes Bill Donohue, the controversial leader of the Catholic League, who previously criticized the show after the \\"Bloody Mary\\" episode. * \\"Canada on Strike\\": A husband and wife driving are witness to Ike holding a sign: \\"Honk if you support Canada\\", the husband honks twice, and upon his wife confirming to him \\"Oh, we're supporting unions\\" he states to her \\"That's right; we're a very progressive couple\\", and later \\"Well we've done our good deed for the week. I think now I can make love to your anus without making God angry\\". * \\"Imaginationland Episode III\\": Within a plead to US generals not to \\"nuke our imagination\\" despite it having gone wild in the Pentagon's Operation Imagination Doorway, Kyle states that \\"I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of 'real'. They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us\\" * \\"Ginger Cow\\": Cartman's prank, dressing a cow as a \\"ginger\\", fools Christians, Muslims, and Jews into thinking it is a doomsday prophecy. They come together in peace and harmony, while Cartman blackmails Kyle to hide the truth to keep the peace going. =Politics= * \\"Trapper Keeper\\": The kindergarten class votes for Class President; satire on the 2000 U.S. presidential election and the inclusion of many famous figures (especially Rosie O'Donnell) only further complicating issues. * \\"Douche and Turd\\": the school votes for a new mascot, and P. Diddy terrorizes the cast into voting; satire on the 2004 U.S. presidential election. This episode essentially depicts the Democratic Party and the Republican Party as being not particularly desirable (a douche and a turd sandwich). When Stan points out that there isn't any point in voting if the only options are a douche and a turd, at the end it is pointed out that most elections that will ever occur will be between a douche and a turd. * The concept of political correctness is criticized in \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\", \\"Chef Goes Nanners\\", \\"Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000\\", and virtually the entire nineteenth season, where it served as a central theme and introduced a new character, PC Principal. * The first episode of the seventeenth season, \\"Let Go, Let Gov\\", satirizes the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures in which Cartman infiltrates the NSA and eventually becomes a whistleblower, similar to Edward Snowden. * The sixth episode of the eighth season, \\"Goobacks\\", deals with illegal immigration. * In \\"Obama Wins!,\\" Cartman manages to steal ballots in the 2012 presidential election swing states of Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Nevada, and Colorado in an attempt to ensure that Barack Obama wins the election and Cartman gets a part in the next Star Wars movie. Also, China is discovered as making a deal with President Obama. Ironically, Mitt Romney won North Carolina in real life. This means that Obama would have won reelection even with the ballots Cartman stole as the President had the 270 needed to secure reelection. Saddam Hussein, 9/11, the War on Terror, and the Iraq War * In \\"Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus\\" and onward, Saddam tries to take over Canada, becomes Satan's lover in Bigger, Longer & Uncut, in future episodes is caught trying to manufacture weapons of mass destruction in Heaven, and is eventually captured in \\"It's Christmas in Canada\\" (after the real-life one was captured in Iraq). * The U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and September 11 attacks are used as backgrounds for \\"Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants\\". * The Iraq War is also premised or discussed in \\"Red Sleigh Down\\". * In \\"I'm a Little Bit Country\\", war protesters are portrayed as needing the war supporters so that the United States would not become weak and unable to defend itself from attack, while war supporters are shown as needing the war protesters so the U.S. would not seem like a power hungry or tyrannical government. The theory was discovered by Cartman (in a flashback) to have originated from the founding fathers, who referred to it as \\"having your cake and eating it too\\". * \\"Mystery of the Urinal Deuce\\" discusses and parodies many of the 9/11 conspiracy theories, which are shown as being created by the government in an effort to appear to have power over the events. * \\"Reverse Cowgirl\\" has a parody of the TSA which is created when Clyde's Mom dies because somebody left the toilet seat up. =Other= * \\"Conjoined Fetus Lady\\" and \\"Timmy 2000\\" address the acceptance of people with disabilities. * \\"Proper Condom Use\\" addresses the teaching of sexual education in schools with a Mad Max 2-esque storyline. * \\"Sexual Harassment Panda\\" addresses frivolous lawsuits ‚Äì especially those against public institutions. * \\"Here Comes the Neighborhood\\" lampoons Class hate with allusions to racism by pitting townspeople who happen be white against \\"richers\\" who happen be black. * \\"Gnomes\\" addresses corporate take over of small businesses, and makes the point that America was founded on free enterprise and capitalism. * \\"Best Friends Forever\\" satirizes the final days of the Terri Schiavo case and the debate over right to die. Schiavo died on March 31, 2005, the day after the episode initially aired. * \\"Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina\\" has a subplot about Kyle and his father having both self and body image problems with themselves not being perfect. They refuse to accept their physical appearance (Kyle not being tall black and Gerald not being and wanting to be a dolphin) and they used cosmetic surgery to \\"help\\" the problem. * \\"Night of the Living Homeless\\" addresses homelessness with a storyline similar to George Romero's Living Dead series. *\\"Tonsil Trouble\\" has a subplot about Cartman having HIV and Kyle laughing at Cartman for having it and Cartman infecting Kyle with HIV and they turn to Magic Johnson for help, It also addresses the using of HIV positive jokes. * \\"Butters' Bottom Bitch\\" points out the social disadvantages to prostitution being illegal, and proposes an alternate system wherein prostitutes need not suffer abuse and instead receive housing and health care. * \\"Crack Baby Athletic Association\\" addresses the disparity between the profitability of college sports, particularly basketball, and the lack of compensation for student athletes. * \\"The Hobbit\\" also addresses body and self-image issues as well as the views of a world with programs like Photoshop. * \\"You Have 0 Friends\\" addressed the matter of Facebook and social isolation. * \\"Cock Magic\\" deals with the issue of Illegal gambling, Cockfighting in particular . * \\"Le Petit Tourette deals with the issue of Tourette syndrome. * \\"W.T.F.\\" parodies several aspects of professional wrestling, highlighting the sport's emphasis on such theatrical elements as costumes, back stories and scripted storylines. * \\"PC Principal Final Justice\\" features a subplot that lampoons American's pervasive gun culture. *\\"Dead Kids\\" addresses the frequency of school shootings in the United States and the American public's growing desensitization to mass shootings in general. * \\"The Pandemic Special\\" tackles a wide range of issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic including: the economic impact, the United States' response, racial unrest, police brutality, mental health, improper mask wearing, education, sinophobia, and the movement to Defund the police.

Walter after Walter left Mary Baker Eddy's Christian Science church in 1912. He named his organization \\"The Walter Method of Christian Science\\"; the term Eschatology as a trade mark for Walter's teaching was not used until the 1920s. William W. Walter Will WalterWilliam Wilfred Walter was born in Sublette, Illinois on July 13, 1869. Raised in a Catholic family, as a teenager he started to visit other church denominations. He left home at seventeen and moved to Aurora, Illinois. He later returned home and bought a barber shop. There he learned the trade, but soon after returned to his former job in Aurora and at twenty-one married his fianc√©e Barbara Stenger. The couple had a son who became sick and handicapped. The boy was fourteen when Walter became involved in the Christian Science church.Background information - Biographical sketch of Walter by the Eschatology Foundation. (Most of the biographical information of this section is taken from this source.) At twenty-seven Walter was a buyer in a department store, a job he held the rest of his life. He never obtained formal education and had fishing as a hobby. The condition of the son depressed him and by thirty Walter caught tuberculosis. In his writings he claims that after seven years of struggling using the Christian Science healing techniques he finally overcame his illness. Walter thus became involved in trying to heal others as a Christian Science practitioner. Between 1907 and 1910 he wrote three novels about mental healing for his clients and also for people outside the church. In 1910 Walter published The Christ Way under a pseudonym, in which he presented Christian Science concepts without mentioning the religion itself or Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the church. The book was relatively rejected by church members but widely accepted by outsiders. Walter reprinted the book, this time with his real name. Between 1912 and 1916 Walter wrote several more books. In 1916 he also published his first Plain Talk series booklets, which heavily drew upon Eddy's teaching while adding many of his own ideas. In 1917 Walter held a class at his home for his closest followers and started a teaching plan for his \\"Walter Method of Christ Science.\\" He also continued to publish books and booklets for his successive courses. By 1920 some of his students started teaching new students, though Walter always examined them. Walter stipulated that each teacher requested an annual renewal of a permit that he alone granted. He called his teaching \\"the Science of Eschatology\\" and, like Eddy did before, claimed that the science was taught by Jesus. However, unlike Eddy, Walter rejected Christianity as a religion and never founded a church: he restrained himself to teach the \\"Science of Life\\" at his home: a phrase he took freely from Eddy. In the final chapter of The Sharp Sickle, the official textbook of Eschatology published in 1928, Walter, who had written The Sickle a decade before, sees the biblical book of Revelation as prophesizing his own work, but didn't claim any special mission from a personal God: : \\"You might ask how he could know that the individual who unveiled his Revelation would bring it out in two volumes. John knew that the individual who would gain sufficient understanding to do the unveiling would also have wisdom enough to be guided by his great wisdom.\\"William W. Walter, The Sharp Sickle, p. 551 Though Walter claimed that it is impossible \\"to have a leader without a follower\\" he remained the sole leader of Eschatology. In 1941 Walter died suddenly at 72 at his home in St. Petersburg, Florida.\\"William Walter Dies Suddenly in Florida Home\\", Aurora Beacon News, 6 March 1941 He was survived by his wife and his son Arthur. Even though the title of this article says that Eschatology (The Walter Method) is a religious movement, this is incorrect. Mr. Walter was very adamant that this study was a *science* and had nothing to do with religion. Mr. Walter stated in his booklet \\"Our Plan\\" that 'the Walter Method, which is nothing more or less than a plain and practical explanation and application of the method of mental healing given the present age by Mary Baker Eddy, and the further unfoldment of actual life as taught in the science of last things, Eschatology.'  Christian Science and Eschatology  There are some similarities between Eschatology, Christianity, Christian Science, and New Thought and other metaphysical systems. In his 1993 book, Martin Gardner wrote he \\"was astonished by the extent to which today's New Age fantasies were so thoroughly aired a hundred years ago by New Thought leaders.\\" Chapter 14 is dedicated to \\"New Thought, Unity, and Ella Wheeler Wilcox\\" Since Eschatology resulted, specifically, from a schism from Christian Science certain metaphysical doctrines are shared by the two groups, though there are many doctrinal differences as well. =Similarities = Many tenets of Christian Science are shared by students of Eschatology. Both groups: * take the Bible as their guide, but they differ from fundamentalists in that they regard the Bible as having a symbolic meaning in addition to a literal one; for instance they reject the physical existence of hell as eternal damnation (a belief that still appears in Eschatology, a book written by Pope Benedict XVI); * regard Mary Baker Eddy as the re-discoverer of the \\"Science of Life\\" * believe that suffering, especially disease, occur mentally first in belief, or fear in the reality of the problem (\\"mortal mind\\" in Eddy's jargon, \\"wrong thinking\\" in Walter's) before being manifest on the body; * display reservations to accept medical assistance when confronted with illness (though not prohibited, especially to new students); * posit objections to the notion of the material world and regard it as a kind of consensual illusion of the perception (like idealist philosopher George Berkeley); * consider that Jesus healed by his knowledge of a Science of Life: a healing Science that both organizations claim was lost in early Christianity; * like some New Age groups believe that every man is \\"arbiter of his own fate\\"; =Differences = Even though Christian Science differs from orthodox Christianity in some ways, it is still a theistic religion. Eschatology strongly rejects the belief of a personal God. In the chapter \\"Experiments and experiences\\" of The Sickle Walter confess the extreme tribulation, or \\"mental warfare\\" as he called it, that he endured in the process of abandoning theism and the ideas inculcated in him as a child. Walter and the Eschatologists' view of God are much closer to New Thought and the New Age movement than to Christian Scientists. Subsequent to his tribulation and inner deliverance, Walter developed the notion that after Eddy's death a conspiracy within the Christian Science church veiled the original meaning of the book Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, the ideological foundation of the Christian Science movement. Christian scientists deny this and there is no evidence that there have been alterations from Eddy's texts, since the editions of the texts printed today are the same as the ones printed right before Eddy's death. Throughout his later career Walter maintained that in her unaltered writings Eddy's notion of God was non- theistic and that, after the alteration, the writings were given a theistic taint. However, there is no evidence that Eddy rejected the belief of a personal God as radically as Walter did. Walter also believed in the existence of controversial phenomena (known to the secular world as psychokinesis) that can be developed through their respective techniques to the point of conquering old age and even death.  Eschatology after Walter  After Walter's unexpected death in 1941 the movement fell into confusion. Eventually Genevieve L. Rader, who began her study with Walter in 1921, continued his work. In the early 1960s she moved the organization's headquarters from Aurora to Pacific Palisades in California. Rader wrote the Questions and Answers commentary to Walter's four stages in the teaching of Eschatology: the Beginners Course, The Sickle Course, the Primary Notes Course and The Sharp Sickle Course. She also delivered the annual Teacher's Graduate Course. In July 1981 Rader relinquished the responsibility of Director of Teaching and was succeeded by her secretary, Evelyn Durling. In July 1987, at Durling's recommendation, Marjorie D. Westad was appointed as her successor, and in August 1998 Westad recommended Bruce C. Smith, who is the current Director of Eschatology. From the 1970s through the 21st century the movement has flourished in other countries, particularly in Mexico. Criticism The Journal of the American Medical Association (22 September 1989) reported on a study of Christian Scientists. The death rate among Christian scientists in the study from cancer double the national average, and 6 percent of them died from causes considered preventable by doctors. The non-\\"Scientists\\" on the average lived four years longer if they were women and two longer if they were men. For critics this study is relevant to Eschatologists as well. For example, on May 2001 Juan del R√≠o, founder of a school based on Eschatology teachings in Mexico City and author of S√°nate a ti mismo (How to heal yourself) died of cancer after a four-year battle with the disease. Eschatologists counter that not every practitioner correctly applies the techniques, and claim that a school \\"based on Eschatology teachings\\" or Christian Science as it stands today is not Eschatology as taught by William Walter.

Santa Domenica Vittoria is named after a Calabrian saint, who was a victim of the Roman persecution of Christians under Diocletian. Festival Feast of St. Anthony The main folklore event in the town is the Feast of St. Anthony, the town's patron. The actual feast day is 17 January, but given the cold winters that are usually accompanied by heavy snow and below freezing conditions, it is celebrated on the first Sunday of September. Before the day of celebrations there are seven days of prayer in the local church. On the day of the feast many of the men of the town dress in white and carry a statue of St Anthony in a procession through every street of town and the townspeople traditionally pin money to the statue as it passes by their balconies. The day ends with a fireworks display and a party in the town's main piazza. Gallery File:Chiesa Madre di Santa Domenica Vittoria.JPGMother Church in Santa Domenica Vittoria.

It begins with an author's note explaining that the origin of the story and that in the original Hindu version of the story, God is Shiva and the archangel is his wife, Parvati. It is not listed in the contents of Nightmares & Dreamscapes. Plot summary It tells the tale of an old beggar named Ramu who has had a miserable life. One day Ramu is walking along thinking about his unhappy existence and feeling angry at God. God, at the request of an archangel who felt pity for the beggar, drops a massive diamond on his path in plain sight. The diamond is worth so much that it would feed him and all his descendants for several generations. On the ground, Ramu has decided after some pondering that he should not be angry about his life or blame God because he still has a few things to be grateful for, such as retaining his sight at such an old age. To illustrate to himself how much worse life could be if he were blind, he decides to close his eyes as he walks. Ironically, he does not see the diamond because of this and merrily walks past it, missing it by just inches. God takes back the diamond and puts an ironwood branch further up the path.

The exterior of Tom's Restaurant on the corner of West 112th Street and Broadway, near Columbia University, which first appears in season 1 episode 3, \\"The Robbery,\\" is often shown on the show as the exterior of Monk's, though the interiors were shot on a sound stage. The restaurant consists of a number of booths, tables, and a counter. Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer normally sit in the first or second booth from the entrance. The owner of the fictional caf√© is Larry the Cook, played by Lawrence Mandley. He first appears in \\"The Outing\\" during season 4. In the season 4 finale, \\"The Pilot\\", Elaine is incensed that Monk's \\"new management\\" is hiring nothing but big-breasted waitresses. The new owner is identified as Mr. Visaki (played by Al Ruscio) and the well-endowed employees turn out to be his daughters. However, in the season 5 episode, \\"The Wife\\", Larry has returned as the owner/manager and appears in that role throughout the remainder of the show's run. Monk's cashier's name is Ruth Cohen, sharing her name with the actress that portrays her. \\"Ruthie\\" appears in 101 of the 180 Seinfeld episodes, the most of any character other than the four leads. In most appearances, she appears as a non-speaking background character. Jerry refers to a competing coffee shop, Reggie's, as \\"the bizarro coffee shop.\\" According to George, it has practically the same menu but is disliked by Jerry and Elaine (in \\"The Soup\\") for its failure to serve an \\"egg white omelette\\" or the famed \\"big salad.\\" In \\"The Pool Guy\\" George eats at Reggie's because there is no room for him at the table in Monk's, with Susan taking up the fourth spot. Jerry Seinfeld and writer Larry David, who created Seinfeld, called the coffee shop Monk's because there was a poster of the pianist and jazz great Thelonious Monk in the office in which they were writing. In the original pilot \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles,\\" the luncheonette was known as Pete's, and featured a waitress named Claire (played by Lee Garlington); Claire was originally conceived as a regular for the show, but was written out (and Pete's replaced by Monk's) by the time the show went to series, because it was decided that having the female lead be from such a different social status compared to the rest of the cast would be unworkable.

He was previously Guinea's Ambassador to France from 1978 to 1984 and was Secretary-General of the Unity and Progress Party (PUP) from 1995 to 2002. Political career until 2002 Sompar√© was born in Dakonta, located in Bok√© Prefecture. He was the Regional Director of Education in Lab√© from August 1970 to September 1973, Director-General of Secondary Education at the Ministry of Pre-University Education from September 1973 to December 1976, and Director- General of the Information Services from December 1976 to February 1978. Subsequently, he was posted to Paris as Guinea's Ambassador to France from February 1978 to September 1984; after his return from Paris, he was an advisor at the Ministry of Administrative Reform and the Civil Service from November 1984 to July 1986. He was then Administrator of the Palace of Nations (the presidential palace) in Conakry from July 1986 to May 1987 and Rector of the University of Conakry from May 1987 to May 1989. From August 1989 to October 1990, Sompar√© was the National Coordinator of the Adjustment Programme for the Education Sector; he was then Secretary-General of the Ministry of the Interior and Decentralization from October 1990 to March 1992. Later, he was elected to the National Assembly in the June 1995 parliamentary election, and at that time he became Secretary-General of the PUP as well as President of the PUP/PCN Parliamentary Group. He remained in those positions until 2002. President of the National Assembly After Sompar√© was re-elected to the National Assembly in the June 2002 parliamentary election,\\"Aboubacar Sompar√© √©lu pr√©sident de l‚ÄôAssembl√©e lors d‚Äôune s√©ance boycott√©e par les ambassadeurs du G7\\" , Afrique Express, number 256, 2 October 2002 . he was chosen by President Lansana Cont√© to become President of the National Assembly. Cont√© had some difficulty obtaining the necessary support for Sompar√© among parliamentary deputies, and for that reason he delayed the opening of the National Assembly.Abou Bakr and Rukmini Callimachi, \\"Guinea coup leader parades through capital\\", Associated Press, 25 December 2008. Ultimately he was elected as President of the National Assembly at a special session\\"Aboubacar Sompar√© √©lu pr√©sident de l'Assembl√©e guin√©enne\\", Panapress, 24 September 2002 . on 23 September 2002, receiving the support of 87 of the 106 deputies who voted. Although Sompar√© held a key post as President of the National Assembly, it was believed that the ailing President Cont√© disliked him;Paul Melly, \\"Guinea: Early Warning Analysis\\", Writenet, August 2003, page 3. he was also reportedly unpopular with the army and much of the PUP leadership.\\"Guinea in Transition\\", Crisis Group Africa Briefing, number 37, 11 April 2006, page 5. During that time, Sompar√© was apparently engaged in a rivalry with PUP Secretary-General S√©kou Konat√©. Sompar√©'s position as Cont√©'s constitutional successor concerned some, who believed he would be unwilling to surrender power if he ever obtained it. On the other hand, it was noted that Sompar√© enjoyed little popularity with any group and therefore might lack the political base to perpetuate himself in power. In early 2006, when Cont√© left Guinea to receive medical treatment in Switzerland, Sompar√© reportedly met with military officers to discuss the presidential succession; Cont√© was said to be infuriated by that move. Speaking to Jeune Afrique in 2008, Sompar√© said that he thought Cont√©, who was known to be in extremely poor health, would not be a candidate for re-election in the planned 2010 presidential election. He also addressed the failure to hold a parliamentary election on schedule (as the parliamentary term began in 2002, it would normally have expired in 2007), saying that an election should only be held if it would \\"contribute to strengthen the social fabric and democracy\\" and not if it would \\"contribute to disorder\\".Djibril S.

Created by former head writers Kay Alden and John F. Smith, the character made his debut during the episode airing on July 11, 2003. Rikaart's portrayal of the role was only slated to be short term, however, the character's popularity resulted in the actor being placed on contract. Introduced as an internet predator, the character later developed into a \\"good person\\", keeping away from criminal activity. Kevin is known for his relationships with Jana Hawkes (Emily O'Brien), which was well received by viewers and garnered a fan following, as well, with Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson). Their romance has been subject to mixed reviews. Rikaart has been praised for his portrayal of the role; Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps considers him to be \\"one of the most talented and best young actors on daytime\\". Rikaart's performance has been met with critical acclaim, having garnered him Daytime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2018, winning the award in 2005. Development =Early years= Kevin was introduced as an internet predator, and later committed multiple other felonies. After his criminal activity died down, Rikaart commented that, \\"In a way, it's almost like he got what he wanted\\". He stated: \\"This life that has always seemed so appealing to him - a wife, he owns his own business, and is respected in the community. But he's had a moment to reflect and say, 'Wait a second, is that it?' I think it seems kind of complacent and boring to him, and again, it's fighting the urges of his past versus what he knows is the right thing to do. And let's be real‚Äîif he stopped being who he was, people might like him, but eventually they'd grow tired of watching Kevin just pour coffee.\\" He added that, \\"Most of us are good people, but we've done bad things, and if someone has a mean streak, it doesn't mean they're incapable of doing good things.\\" Upon his debut, Kevin targeted Lily Winters (Christel Khalil); they had a sexual encounter and he infected Lily with the sexually transmitted disease chlamydia. Khalil taped public service announcements related to the story, and considered the plot one of her favorites. She stated: \\"How many soaps have really covered that? The meeting on the Internet, getting an STD, it was really great stuff.\\" When asked why he is able to \\"tap into Kevin's vulnerability so well\\", Rikaart stated: \\"I think showing vulnerability gets me through the tough stuff that comes his way sometimes, where it‚Äôs like me as an ethical person might judge Kevin‚Äôs motives.\\" Rikaart stated what he liked most about Kevin is \\"the push/pull that happens in his brain, where he is like, ‚ÄúI want to be a better person. I want to be a good guy.‚Äù Then it's really easy for him to get lured into some sort of underhanded stuff.\\" =Relationships= Greg Rikaart stated that his personal relationship with Elizabeth Hendrickson influenced former head writer Maria Arena Bell to pair their characters. In 2008, Kevin married Jana Hawkes (Emily O'Brien), and their pairing garnered a fan following. Of their relationship, Rikaart stated: \\"Jana's very suspicious of Kevin and what he's done, and feels really bad about it. I have faith that we're solid as a couple to survive that, but it's also going to provide some really great, and much needed, conflict between the two.\\" Jana later began to have bizarre behavior, which was explained after her diagnosis of a brain tumor. Rikaart stated: \\"That is what we are banking on, at least for Kevin. The tumor was this great explanation for Jana‚Äôs behavior. I think he never really understood why she did what she did. Kevin is trying to create this whole defense for her; that everything she did was because of the tumor.\\" In 2010, Kevin divorced Jana and later began dating Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson). Rikaart and Hendrickson later stated that their personal relationship influenced former head writer Maria Arena Bell to pair the characters. Of Kevin's love and relationship with Chloe, Rikaart stated, \\"It came out of that sort of build of emotions that have been happening within him, that whether he realized it or not, has been going on for a long time already.\\" Hendrickson added that she thought Chloe \\"had been through so much with guys, and even if she had feelings for Kevin, it was so deep down that it wasn‚Äôt even something she was willing to recognize. I think that what happened between her two great loves had damaged her so much, that I don‚Äôt think she was willing to accept the fact that this is possibly what love could be like.\\" In 2011, when she first arrived in Genoa City, Angelina Veneziano (Diana DeGarmo) set her eyes on Kevin, whom she developed a huge crush on. Of her crazy crush, DeGarmo said: \\"Ooh, she wants him bad! Angie has her eyes, her heart and her body set on landing Kevin ‚Äî and it scares him to death.\\" She said that Kevin was too sweet and nervous, and is weakened to Angelina's preying on him. \\"She loves seeing him squirm\\", DeGarmo stated. Of working with Rikaart, she said: \\"Greg and I can't stop laughing during our scenes together.\\" During an interview with MSN, she stated: \\"I've had the great pleasure sharing the screen with Mr. Greg Rikaart. Angelina gets a little bit of a crush on Kevin, and she's not afraid not to show it. It's a blast, because she makes him incredibly nervous The sparks that fly on screen are just hilarious. It's wonderful to be a part of.\\" Just before Kevin was set to marry Chloe, Angelina persuaded him to help her escape town, as she was in danger. Things later got to the stage where Angelina's father forced Kevin to marry his daughter. Becca Badget of Yahoo! wrote: \\"Kevin keeps to himself that he married Angelina to avoid a bullet from Angelo's henchman. The guests are unaware that he married her to stay alive.\\" On whether or not Kevin will ever love her, DeGarmo said: \\"I know she sure hopes so. She did try to get him to marry her.\\" The relationship, however, ended when Angelina realizes that he never loved her. DeGarmo said: \\"Kevin does see the light inside Angelina, even though that light may be a little dim sometimes.\\" Kevin and Chloe were able to marry in March 2012. They decided to start a website together, titled TagNGrab. In 2013, Kevin and Chloe battle money struggles, causing him to commit crimes in order to obtain money. Hendrickson stated they were having \\"a blast\\" with the storyline, saying: \\"Money is usually a common issue between couples. They‚Äôre kind of battling through this struggle. He‚Äôs trying to do his best to take care of the family and morally, it just doesn‚Äôt sit well with her. Especially with what he‚Äôs been through in the past.\\" Rikaart told On-Air On-Soaps that he and Hendrickson have discussed wanting the characters to break up, \\"We always say, 'We have done this. We have played this. Now let‚Äôs play breaking up.' That will be different.\\" Kevin and Chloe's relationship has been subject to mixed reviews. Although Zap2it praised the pairing in 2010, they later listed the pair on their \\"10 Worst Soap Opera Couples of 2012\\". They stated: \\"We were all fans of John Hughes' movies in the '80s, but sometimes the Geek and the Glamour Puss are meant to just be friends; this is certainly the case with Kevin Fisher's (Greg Rikaart) sexless romance with Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson) on The Young and the Restless. We adore Kev and Chloe‚Äîseparately‚Äîbut as a couple they do absolutely nothing for us.\\" In May 2017, it was reported that Rikaart would be exiting the show, last airing in August. Rikaart last aired on July 18, 2017, alongside Elizabeth Hendrickson's Chloe Mitchell. However, Rikaart continued to make appearances until February 20, 2018. In April 2019, following Rikaart's departure from Days of Our Lives, it was announced that he would return in the role, returning during the final moments of the June 7, 2019, episode. Storylines In 2003, teenaged Lily Winters met a mentally unstable internet predator, Kevin Fisher, in an online chat room. Even though Kevin was much older than Lily, the two start dating, and Kevin often persuaded Lily to skip school to hang out with him. He eventually convinced her to have sex with him. The statutory rape resulted in Kevin giving Lily chlamydia, a common sexually transmitted disease. Colleen Carlton, Lily's best friend, hated Kevin and Lily's relationship and often told Kevin how she felt. In return, Kevin attempted to kill Colleen by locking her in the refrigerator at local restaurant, Gina's, and then setting it on fire. He was never found guilty for these crimes. However, in 2004, while working as a bookkeeper at Marilyn's Cabaret, Kevin was wrongly accused of electrocuting Brittany Hodges. Desperate to avoid jail time, Kevin turned to his half-brother, Michael, for help. They were soon joined by their mother, Gloria, after Kevin ran away back home to Detroit, fearing that he would be sent to jail. Gloria decided to return with Kevin and Michael after Michael made a deal with the police. Later, Kevin was sent to prison, where he was beaten to a pulp by cellmates because they knew that he committed statutory rape. Later, Kevin befriended Daniel Romalotti, who just returned to Genoa City from boarding school, and MacKenzie Browning. Mac was a very good friend to Kevin, and she persuaded him to seek counseling to become a better person. Michael won some money in the lottery and gave Kevin some money to enter a partnership with Mac and purchase Crimson Lights Coffee House from Nicholas Newman and his wife, Sharon Newman. Kevin's abusive father, \\"Terrible Tom\\" Fisher, surfaced in 2005 and Kevin was forced to relive the memories of the physical and emotional violence that Tom inflicted upon him as a child. Tom was later shot by John Abbott, who later died in prison while serving time for the killing. In 2006, Mac left town after a bad break up with J.T. Hellstrom, and Kevin was left to run Crimson Lights alone. Shortly after Mac left, Kevin began dating new Crimson Lights worker, Jana Hawkes. Kevin and Jana married and it was later revealed that, suffering from a brain tumor, Jana had killed Carmen Mesta. She was freed from jail after being found not responsible for her actions due to her medical condition. In February 2007, Jana staged the kidnapping of herself and Colleen and set up Kevin for kidnapping and attempted murder. Kevin and Jana reunited after it was revealed that Jana's brain tumor had caused her deranged behavior. Kevin proposed to Jana on Thanksgiving Day. Months later, the two were married in an Ashram in Malibu, California, by a guru who turned out to be Michael's father, Lowell \\"River\\" Baldwin. Lowell was later revealed to be a con man. Later, Katherine was kidnapped by Clint Radison, with whom she'd had trouble twenty years earlier. As Clint and his accomplices, Roger and Annie Wilkes, held Katherine and her maid, Esther Valentine, hostage in a motel, Kevin and Amber Moore managed to track them down. However, Kevin was tricked by Clint and drugged. The three criminals took photos of Kevin holding a bomb to make it seem as if he was planning to blow up the motel with Katherine and Esther inside. Kevin was then locked in a closet where he was forced to relive the abuse he suffered as a child from \\"Terrible Tom.\\" Meanwhile, Kay and Esther were rescued by Gloria and Amber. While being held hostage, Kevin (wearing a giant chipmunk mascot head) was ordered to rob banks. Clint had a sudden heart attack and died. Amber soon found Kevin, who was not in his right mind. She was taken hostage by Kevin and forced to rob a bank with him. Kevin and Amber were arrested and Michael had Kevin admitted for psychological evaluation. While Kevin was going through his own problems, Jana had her fair share of misfortunes as well; she and Lauren Fenmore were kidnapped by Kevin's half- siblings, Daisy Carter and Ryder Callahan, and locked in a cage at an amusement park. After their rescue, Kevin was devastated to discover that Jana had begun an affair with Ryder. Kevin then found a friend in Chloe Mitchell, who was dealing with some devastation of her own after breaking up with her fiance, Chance Chancellor, after he revealed to her that he had had a one- night stand with Heather Stevens. Jana became jealous of Kevin and Chloe's growing closeness. Jana, still wanting Kevin for herself, kidnapped Daniel's daughter, Lucy, and Chloe's daughter, Delia. Kevin told Jana to let the girls go and she then took Kevin hostage and forced him go into a closet, making him again relive \\"Terrible Tom's\\" abuse. Jana ended up dying in a struggle with Chloe, who had come to rescue Kevin. Jana's autopsy revealed she had died of natural causes. As Chloe and Kevin were to get married he called it off after Angelina Veneziano convinced him her boyfriend Carmine was after Kevin and that he and Angelina were in danger. Kevin told Chloe they could not get married at that time, leaving her heartbroken. First Kevin and Angelina ran off to a hotel room in Niagara Falls. Angelina then revealed the truth to Kevin: she put the whole scheme together in hopes he would fall in love with her while on the run. Meanwhile, Anglina's mobster father, Angelo, sent a goon, Dino, to find them and kill Kevin. Angelina told her father over the phone that she and Kevin were getting married. Kevin and Angelina were forced into marrying each other in front of Dino in order to save Kevin's life. Back in Genoa City, Kevin told Chloe why he had to leave her at the altar. He lets her know that there was never any doubt in his mind about their relationship whatsoever, that she is the one he wants to be with, not Angelina. Eventually, Angelina released Kevin from the marriage. Kevin and Chloe stop Gloria from marrying Angelo and Michael announces that Kevin's marriage to Angelina has been annulled. Jeffrey and Kevin then get down on their knees and propose to both Gloria and Chloe, who both accept. Both couples marry on March 27, 2012. Kevin and Chloe get married and turn their attention to running Crimson Lights. Their marriage falls apart after Delia dies, but Kevin still stays friends with Chloe worried about her mental well-being. Chloe briefly returns to Genoa City on the one-year anniversary of Delia's death. She reveals to Kevin that she had been given a 24-hour pass from the clinic in order to visit the accident site. She tells Kevin that she also does not plan on returning to Genoa City, instead wishing to begin a new life somewhere else, without Kevin and her family. As she leaves, she rubs her pregnant belly, assuring Delia that her emptiness would once again by fulfilled, believing that the child is Billy's when it could also be Kevin's. She returns again in 2016, working as an outside aid to Victor under the alias of Dorothy Gale, helping plot out his revenge against Adam. When Victor ends up shot and in the hospital, Chloe unveils herself and confesses that she and her daughter, Bella, will be making a permanent return to Genoa City, to make sure Adam ultimately pays for his crimes, once and for all. She later shoots Adam and orchestrates an explosion, leading to his death, but covers up her involvement in the ordeal with Victor's help. After returning to Genoa City permanently with her daughter, Chloe reconnects with Kevin and Chelsea as she and Kevin prepare to remarry. However, Nick Newman expresses suspicion to Chelsea over Chloe's possible role in Adam's death and her crimes are revealed at her wedding to Kevin; once again with Victor's help, she arranges to disappear again. Meanwhile, Bella is revealed as Kevin's biological daughter. Chloe later fakes her death and brings Kevin into her scheme, convincing him it was the only way for them to be a family with their daughter. They move to Portland, Oregon under different names and disappear; however, Kevin later returns to Genoa City with Bella, with no mention of Chloe's whereabouts as she is believed to be dead.

It was established in 1962 by Ryoichi Sasakawa, a late statesman and businessman. The foundation's mission is to direct Japanese motorboat racing revenue into philanthropic activities, and it uses these monies to pursue global maritime development and assistance for humanitarian work, both at home and abroad. In the humanitarian field, it focuses on such fields as social welfare, public health, and education. The current chairman is Yohei Sasakawa, World Health Organization Goodwill Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination, Special Envoy of the Government of Japan for National Reconciliation in Myanmar, and the son of the foundation's founder, Ryoichi Sasakawa.

The law and the foundation were initiatives of Ryoichi Sasakawa who, as chair, used them to both help rebuild the Japanese shipbuilding sector, and to conduct philanthropic activities around the world. This system of using gambling revenue to provide aid to needy sectors was a novel one in Japan at that time, and came under intense scrutiny. In response, the foundation strove for transparency\\"Nippon Foundation financial statements (Japanese) ,\\" in conducting its activities, making its records publicly accessible from its earliest days. Initiatives pursued in this period include research for the development of super tankers and their engines, direct support for the shipbuilding industry, and the protection of safety in the Strait of Malacca‚Äîvital to Japan's national security, due to the fact that more than 80 percent of her oil passes this way. In the field of public welfare, the foundation pursued such youth-oriented initiatives as the building of sports facilities, the building of day care centers and the promotion of traffic safety education. In addition, it began donating mobile clinics and blood-mobiles, as well as constructing blood banks around the country. ;1971‚Äì1980 Vehicle with wheelchair slope In the 1970s, the foundation continued to pursue its efforts to improve social services through such measures as the distribution of ambulances, training in the use of fire fighting equipment, the development of preventative measures for earthquakes and PR for the fire-fighting sector. It also donated medical ships to provide medical aid for people living on remote islands in Japan's inland sea. In 1971, it began its overseas work, and in 1974 established the Sasakawa Memorial Health Foundation\\"Sasakawa Memorial Health Foundation\\" for the purpose of eliminating leprosy as a public health problem‚Äîan effort that has resulted in its elimination in all but 1 of the 122 countries where the disease was initially prevalent.\\"Eliminating Leprosy, the Nippon Foundation\\" ;1981‚Äì1990 Support for the maritime world remained an important focus in the 1980s, building on the work of the previous decade. Examples of projects include \\"Swift Wings\\", which was a sail system designed for modern cargo ships, and research toward a \\"Techno Superliner\\", a 1,000-ton cargo vessel that could attain speeds of up to 50 knots. On the international cooperative support front, the foundation involved itself heavily in disaster relief, sending aid to help the victims of major disasters in countries around the world, and establishing the United Nations Sasakawa Award for Disaster Relief.\\"United Nations Sasakawa Award for Disaster Relief,\\" Health initiatives that began in this decade include the establishment of the WHO Sasakawa Health prize and a massive project to aid the victims of the Chernobyl nuclear power disaster, under which the foundation spent a total of more than US$50 million over ten years, screening over 200,000 children for thyroid cancer.Chernobyl: Message for the 21st Century, p xvii. Up until 1988, the foundation went by the name the Japanese Shipbuilding Industry Foundation (JSIF), and even donated some supposedly $500,000 worth of fireworks to the Los Angeles 1984 Organizing Committee for use in those Olympics. It was much more than the LA Organizing Committee wanted to use, and they were forced to come up with a 25-minute fireworks show to accommodate the gift and NOT slight the Foundation. Sometime around 1988‚Äì1989, the foundation dropped that moniker and went by several other names including the all-inclusive \\"Nippon\\" Foundation. In response to the Ethiopian famine of the mid-1980s, the foundation began a program of agricultural education throughout sub-Saharan Africa that eventually reached 14 countries, improving farmers‚Äô yields by up to six times in some places. Finally, as a part of its human resources development program, the foundation created the Sasakawa Young Leaders‚Äô Fellowship Fund,\\"Sasakawa Young Leaders‚Äô Fellowship Fund\\" a program that would eventually establish million-dollar funds at a total of 68 major universities around the world. ;1991‚Äì2000 In the 1990s, on the home front, the Nippon Foundation invested heavily in the elderly of Japan, pushing for the improvement of retirement homes, building model retirement homes, and helping the nation to develop its hospice system nearly from the ground up. Related to this field, the foundation also began donating specially equipped vehicles\\"The Nippon Foundation's mobility services program\\" to social welfare facilities and groups, enabling them to provide mobility services to the elderly and those with disability. The decade also saw one of Japan's worst earthquakes of the 20th century, and the disorganization of volunteer groups in the wake of the quake lead the foundation to put special attention on bringing these many groups together under one umbrella‚Äîthe volunteer support center‚Äîa central body that coordinated volunteer effort in the event of a major disaster. In the maritime development field, the foundation began to turn its eye to the disparity in the level of training received by maritime experts in various countries. As a result, it provided funding for a scholarship for people from developing countries to attend the World Maritime University, in Malm√∂, Sweden. In perhaps an even broader effort, it created the International Association of Maritime Universities, uniting 50 institutions around the world, in an effort to standardize both the level of education and the materials used. ;2001‚Äìpresent The past years have seen the foundation continue to build on its work of the first four decades, working in the maritime, welfare and international cooperation fields. Since its origins, the foundation has been interested in aiding the nation's shipbuilding and maritime efforts, leading it to support both a display of a North Korean spy vessel that had been sunk by the Japanese Self Defense Forces, and a survey of Okinotori Island. In addition, the foundation is providing support toward the establishment of a user-pays system to help the nations surrounding the Strait of Malacca in their efforts to both police the waters and maintain their environmental integrity. In international affairs, the foundation has most recently built more than 100 elementary schools in Myanmar and 100 in Cambodia. It has established a novel program to provide Mongolian nomadic families with boxes full of traditional medicines that can be replenished, at the cost only of those medicines used, a few times a year, when they come to market.

Controversial remarks =Apology to Canadians= In a five-minute segment broadcast on March 17, 2009, Gutfeld and his panel discussed Canadian Lieutenant General Andrew Leslie's statement that the Canadian Armed Forces may require a one-year \\"synchronized break\\" once Canada's mission in Afghanistan ended in 2011. \\"Meaning, the Canadian military wants to take a breather to do some yoga, paint landscapes, run on the beach in gorgeous white Capri pants,\\" Gutfeld said. \\"I didn't even know they were in the war\\", comedian panelist Doug Benson added, then continued, \\"I thought that's where you go if you don't want to fight. Go chill in Canada.\\" Gutfeld also said: \\"Isn't this the perfect time to invade this ridiculous country? They have no army!\\" The segment drew wide attention and outrage in Canada after being posted on YouTube following the reported deaths of four Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan three days earlier. Canada, at the time, had been in command of the NATO mission in the Kandahar Province, the birthplace and former capital of the Taliban, for the preceding three years. Along with the Helmand Province, the two provinces were \\"home to some of the fiercest opposition to coalition forces\\" and reported to \\"have the highest casualty rates per province.\\" Canadian Defence Minister Peter MacKay called on Fox to apologize for the satirical comments, describing the remarks as \\"despicable, hurtful and ignorant.\\" Gutfeld in response maintained the show is satirical and irreverent but offered the following apology: \\"The March 17 episode of Red Eye included a segment discussing Canada's plan for a 'synchronized break,' which was in no way an attempt to make light of troop efforts. However, I realize that my words may have been misunderstood. It was not my intent to disrespect the brave men, women and families of the Canadian military, and for that I apologize.\\" =Ground Zero mosque= On August 9, 2010, Gutfeld stated that he planned on constructing New York City's first Islamic-friendly gay bar next to the Park51 Islamic community center.

It has since expanded to a site on the waterfront at Pier 29 on The Embarcadero in San Francisco, California.  History  Teatro ZinZanni was created by Norman Langill, and was once described as \\"the Moulin Rouge meets Cirque du Soleil.\\" The show is a blend of European cabaret, circus arts, fine dining, and vaudeville performed in a Belgian spiegeltent (mirror tent). Until mid-2011 the show was produced by the Seattle-based non-profit events company, One Reel. Teatro Zinzanni is now an independent company. Teatro ZinZanni began in Seattle in October 1998 for an eight-week run and ended up playing to sold- out houses until it closed on December 31, 1999. It then moved its operation to San Francisco, opening there in March 2000. In 2002, it reopened a permanent operation in Seattle's Belltown district. The operation has since moved to Seattle's theatre district on Mercer Street across from Seattle Center. As of 2017, Teatro ZinZanni has moved To Redmond WA, in the Marymoor Park Area. This is said to be a temporary location through April 2018, at which time they will move to a permanent location. Teatro ZinZanni's San Francisco location closed its operation on December 31, 2011, due to the city's preparation for the America's Cup, but has plan to reopen at another location on the Embarcadero after fund-raising is complete. Teatro ZinZanni also has a Chicago location in the downtown theatre district. It's a permanent location opened in 2019. The many performers in Teatro ZinZanni productions have included Joan Baez, Duffy Bishop, Yamil Borges, Kevin Kent, Martha Davis of the rock group The Motels, Michael Davis, El Vez, Frank Ferrante, Geoff Hoyle, Sally Kellerman, Liliane Montevecchi, Maria Muldaur, Melanie Stace, Puddles Pity Party, Wayne Doba, also known for being San Francisco Giants mascot the Crazy Crab, Andrea Conway and Ann Wilson of the rock group Heart.

The game was developed by Bezerk and enjoyed its peak popularity during the late 90s.  Gameplay  The player enters a lobby and proceeds to pick a game room, where a game is about to begin or is already underway. Players are shown a picture at the top left corner of the screen, and each user must enter a caption in an allotted amount of time. When the time elapses, the quotes are displayed for all to see but with no mention of their author. Those present in the room then vote to decide which quote is the funniest; the player with the most points at the game's end is declared the winner. In addition to the regular rounds, all games ended with a specialty round where more points were at stake, and usually required a caption of specific nature (ex. in the style of an advertisement).  Current status  Bezerk included advertisements between rounds, but due to lack of revenue produced by these adverts, the game was abandoned.

It is one of several types of trapiche or trapiche-like minerals, which also include trapiche ruby, sapphire, garnet, chiastolite and tourmaline. The name comes from the Spanish term trapiche, a sugar mill, because of the resemblance of the pattern to the spokes of a grinding wheel. Trapiche emeralds were first described by √âmile Bertrand in 1879. They are generally only (and rarely) found in the western part of the Eastern Cordillera basin, in the Muzo, Coscuez and Pe√±as Blancas mines of Colombia (but likely not in Chivor as reported in older literature). Singular finds in Brazil and Madagascar have also been reported. The radial pattern exhibits considerable variance, and often includes a hexagonal structure at the core. There is not yet consensus about the mechanism by which the pattern forms, or the conditions required for it. Various models have been proposed. According to one interpretation the black impurities are remains of the shale matrix in which the emeralds formed, trapped between the radial dendrites of the growing emerald. The trapiche pattern is not an asterism, an optically similar pattern that forms in a different process.

Normally the mine is buried so that only the prongs are visible. The safety clip has been removed from this mine, so the fuze mechanism should be considered to be armed The PROM-1 is a Yugoslavian manufactured bounding type of anti-personnel mine. It consists of a cylindrical body with a pronged fuze inserted into the top of the mine. It is broadly similar in operation to the German S-mine. The mine is triggered by the tilting of the prongs situated on top of the mine. This is caused by either direct pressure on the prongs or by tension on a tripwire attached to them. Tilting the prongs allows at least one of three striker retaining balls to escape. This releases the spring-loaded striker, which is flipped downwards into the percussion cap and fires the three gram propellant charge. The explosion of the propellant charge forces the upper half of the mine body out of the ground and up into the air, shearing off several brass screws and leaving the base plug of the mine behind in the ground. The mine's body is tethered to its base by a short length of wire, which unwinds behind it as it rises. When the mine reaches a height of approximately 65 centimetres the wire is pulled. This jerks the detonator assembly downwards into the striker. The detonator fires, triggering the main explosive charge, which shatters the internally grooved body into a large number of high-velocity steel fragments, which spray in all directions. Because the time taken from triggering the mine to detonation is so short (typically one second), there is no time to take cover from the blast. As with all bounding mines the PROM-1 is lethal at relatively long distances. It is capable of projecting dangerous fragments to range of 100 metres or more, with a potentially lethal range of around 50 metres. This mine will almost certainly kill or seriously injure anyone caught within 30 metres of the blast. As with any bounding mine, wearing standard kevlar body armour offers no guarantee of safety: the large number of fragments produced by a PROM-1 will wound the unprotected limbs, face and eyes of its victim(s). A PROM-1 which has been buried so that only the prongs of the fuze are visible. A tripwire could be connected to the central prong (which has a hole in it) to increase the activation area The PROM-1 can be particularly hard to spot in undergrowth because, apart from the prongs, most of it is buried underground and therefore cannot be seen. Although this mine contains much steel (thereby making it easy to detect with a mine-detector) the act of sweeping the detection head over the ground can easily strike the prongs (or connected tripwire) and detonate the mine. In any case, PROM-1s in a minefield may be surrounded by various types of minimum metal antipersonnel blast mines (e.g. the VS-50) which further hinders the clearance process. The PROM-1 is difficult to render safe because its fuze becomes unstable after being exposed to weather for several years. Most deminers therefore recommend that this mine is destroyed in situ by detonating an explosive charge next to it. PROM-1 in the hands of a deminer. Note that the safety clip is in place, to prevent detonation. Usually (though not always) trip-wires measuring around 20 feet (6 meters) in length are fitted to this mine in order to increase its activation area. When tracking trip-wires back to their source, deminers must keep in mind that other landmines may have been planted along its length. It is all too easy to concentrate on following a trip-wire back to its source, forgetting that there could be PMA-3, PMN or similar blast mines lying buried underneath. The mine has been found in Angola, Bosnia, Chile, Croatia, Eritrea, Iraq, Kosovo, Mozambique and Namibia. Specifications Side view of a PROM-1 mine.

Career McGlynn was born in Dublin and attended Col√°iste na RinneThe Journal of Music in Ireland (Jan./Feb. 2002). and Blackrock College. He was a student of Music and English at University College Dublin and Trinity College where he studied for an M.Litt degree. He was a member of the RT√â Chamber Choir and in 1987 he founded the Irish choral group An√∫na (originally spelt \\"An Ua√≠thne\\").Axel Klein: \\"Die Musik Irlands im 20. Jahrhundert\\" (Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1996), p. 430. An√∫na have released fourteen albums, almost exclusively featuring his arrangements and original works. Deep Dead Blue was nominated for a Classical Brit Award in 2000 and went Top 5 in the UK Classical Charts. An√∫na: Celtic Origins was the biggest selling world music CD in the US in August 2007 according to Nielsen Soundscan , and remained in the top twenty albums of the Billboard World Music Charts until early 2008. Although best known as a writer of choral music, McGlynn has written orchestral and instrumental works as well as cantatas and masses. 2007 saw the premiere of the cantata St. Francis commissioned by RT√â, the Irish National broadcasting station. It is a setting of texts associated with Francis of Assisi for tenor, choir and symphony orchestra. The album Behind the Closed Eye is a collaboration with the Ulster Orchestra, Northern Ireland's premiere orchestra. McGlynn has written music for theatre, including the Adrian Noble/Cusack family production of Anton Chekhov's \\"Three Sisters\\" at the Gate Theatre, Dublin, and the Royal Court, London. He is also a vocal and choral clinician, working recently in the University of Miami (US), Sumida Hall (Japan) and Festival 500 in Newfoundland (Canada). He was an Eminent Scholar at Florida Atlantic University for the 2011‚Äì12 academic year.Contemporary Music Centre, Ireland website In 2017 he was awarded the University College Dublin Alumni Award for Arts and Humanities.University College Dublin Alumni Awards 2017 . McGlynn will be the Artistic Director of the 2021 Tampere Vocal Music Festival in Finland.Tampere Vocal Music Festival New Artistic Director . McGlynn's music has been recorded and performed by such internationally recognised performers and ensembles as Rajaton, Dawn Upshaw, the National Youth Choir of Great Britain, The Dale Warland Singers, the Phoenix Chorale [formerly the Phoenix Bach Choir], Conspirare, the BBC Singers and Chanticleer. Musical language McGlynn's harmonic language combines elements of traditional Irish music such as modal melodic lines and ornamentation, fixed and shifting drones and liberal use of jazz-tinged chordal clusters and sonorities. These features can be heard in his contribution to the Chanticleer-commissioned And on Earth Peace: A Chanticleer Mass. McGlynn contributed the 'Agnus Dei' to this multi-composer work.Gramophone Magazine McGlynn says \\"One of the misapprehensions about my music is that I am not actually concerned with saving Irish traditional music; I am not a traditionalist. The only exposure I had [to traditional Irish song] was during my year at Col√°iste na Rinne in D√∫n Garbh√°n. The songs that I set are not from a specific collection; they are more impressions of the songs I remembered.\\"Stacie Lee Rossow: The Choral Music of Irish Composer Michael McGlynn (2010): . McGlynn also created new compositions that could be perceived as arrangements of Irish songs but were, in fact, new melodies composed to traditional texts. He has stated that \\"People just assume that I have just found a 'living' version. In fact I have done what has made solo traditional music so viable: I have created a new version. I take the songs and reinterpret them in a new way. My priority is always to create a choral version that works.\\" His most successful choral work in this genre is \\"D√∫lam√°n\\", a setting of the traditional Irish poem of the same name. This work has been performed and recorded extensively by professional choral groups such as Chanticleer and Cantus. It features another characteristic aspect of his musical language in its use of multiple alternating rhythms. Karen Marrolli for her 2010 thesis on McGlynn writes: \\"Throughout all of McGlynn's work, while there are a good amount of compositional thumbprints and overarching characteristics, there also is a great deal of variety. This is an incredibly refreshing aspect to McGlynn's choral writing. Various constant influences are present in his music and give his canon a sense of identity; however, he does not simply reconstruct successful pieces over and over again in an attempt to rest on his laurels. His body of work displays a great range of techniques and musical ideas and continues to develop and mature. Further study of some of his more recently recorded works, such as O Maria and the brilliant work Victimae (both released on the 2009 An√∫na CD Sanctus) would reveal how his musical influences factor into his compositional efforts in ever-evolving ways. This continuous growth bodes well for the longevity of this composer as he takes his place among the important composers of our time.An Overview of the Choral Music of Michael McGlynn with a Conductor's Preparatory Guide to His Celtic Mass (2010) Selected works A selection of McGlynn's original works:Rossow, Stacie Lee, \\"The Choral Music of Irish Composer Michael McGlynn\\": * Invocation (Tenor & mixed-chorus) * Four Tenebrae Responsories (Tenebrae I, II, III & IV.

Thomas Gibson Bowles (15 January 1842 ‚Äì 12 January 1922), known generally as Tommy Bowles, was the founder of the magazines The Lady and the English Vanity Fair, a sailor, Member of parliament and the maternal grandfather of the Mitford sisters. Parents He was the illegitimate offspring of Thomas Milner Gibson and a servant named Susannah Bowles. He attended school in France and then studied for a year at King's College London. His father gave him a yearly stipend of ¬£90 and helped him find a job at Somerset House. Journalism He began his journalism and publishing career by writing a column for the Morning Post in 1866. His coverage of the Siege of Paris sent by balloon and pigeon post ensured his fame. He borrowed ¬£200 to found Vanity Fair in 1868. Shattered by the death of his wife Jessica (n√©e Evans-Gordon) in childbirth, he sold his stake in Vanity Fair to Arthur H. Evans in 1887 for ¬£20,000. He founded The Lady magazine in 1885, supposedly spurred by advice Jessica had once given to him. He became a competent sailor and wrote for decades in support of the Royal Navy. Bowles (nicknamed Jehu Junior after a biblical prophet who effected the downfall of his enemies) compiled the biographical notes that went with the caricatures. He was editor for twenty years and shaped magazine policy so that no-one was exempt from his enquiring eye. This approach made for an entertaining and popular magazine. The targets of Jehu Junior's satire usually considered themselves honoured to have been chosen, and although the scrutiny was acute, it was humorous rather than malicious. Bowles managed to achieve this extraordinarily difficult balancing act throughout his association with the magazine. Politics At the 1892 general election, he was elected as Conservative Party Member of Parliament for King's Lynn and served in the House of Commons until losing his seat at the 1906 election. He was re-elected at the January 1910 as a Liberal, but lost his seat again at the December 1910 election. He stood in the 1916 Harborough by-election as an independent. His late wife's brother Sir William Evans-Gordon also sat as a Conservative MP in 1900-07. He died while on a holiday at Algeciras, Spain, and is buried in Gibraltar. Family In 1875, he married Jessica (1852‚Äì87), daughter of General Charles Evans-Gordon (1813‚Äì1901), a descendant of \\"Gordon of Lochinvar\\", and his wife Catherine, n√©e Rose. Their children were: * George (1877‚Äì1955) RN, MP & barrister who married Madeline Mary Tobin (b. 1893) * Geoffrey (1879‚Äì1968) Royal Navy Commander; * Sydney (1880‚Äì1963) married the then Hon. David Mitford in 1902, and was the mother of the Mitford sisters; * Dorothy (1885‚Äì1971) who married Col. Percy Bailey. According to his granddaughter Julia Budworth, Bowles also fathered the last three of the four children of assistant Rita Shell (his children's governess, after the death of his wife Jessica Evans-Gordon), who changed her surname to Stewart. She later became editor of The Lady. They were Humphrey (b. 1891), Oliver (b. 1895) and Peter (b. 1900). (See \\"Never Forget\\" pp. 616‚Äì618\\"). Peter Stewart later assisted at Marlborough House when it was used by Queen Mary.

Patrick Johnson is the incoming dean of the Northwestern University School of Communication. He is the Carlos Montezuma Professor of Performance Studies and Professor of African-American Studies at Northwestern University. He currently serves as the Chair of the African-American Studies Department at Northwestern University and is a Visiting Scholar at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. Johnson is the Founding Director of the Black Arts Initiative at Northwestern. His scholarly and artistic contributions focus on Performance Studies, African-American Studies and Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies. Early life Born Elondust Patrick Johnson on March 1, 1967, the youngest of seven children in Hickory, North Carolina, Johnson was raised by his mother, Sarah M. Johnson, a factory worker. They grew up in a one-bedroom apartment in Ridgeview, a majority-Black section of Hickory. Though she had only acquired a 10th grade education herself, his mother emphasized schooling and nurtured Johnson's creative talents early on and entered him in community talent shows. His first grade teacher, Beverly \\"Bunny\\" White, was instrumental in nurturing his creative and academic talents as well, by providing access to spaces that were closed to blacks and by providing financial support. He was also mentored by black women in the Ridgeview Community, including Z. Ann Hoyle, who became the first black alderman of Hickory's city council. Hoyle would eventually spearhead a resolution to honor Johnson with his own day in 1996. He attended Hickory High School, where he was Senior Class President, and later the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. At UNC-Chapel Hill, he was involved with a number of campus groups, including the Black Student Movement and the gospel choir. He entered college as a theater major, but after becoming a work-study student in the Speech Communications department, he switched his major. It was in that department that he was introduced to performance studies, oral history, and performance ethnography and influenced by his teachers and mentors D. Soyini Madison, Della Pollock, and Trudier Harris. Johnson received both his bachelor and master's degrees from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill in Speech Communications before completing his PhD in Speech Communications at Louisiana State University with certificates in English and Anthropology. Career After earning his PhD, Johnson became an Assistant Professor of English at Amherst College. In 2000, Johnson joined the faculty of the Department of Performance Studies Department at Northwestern University as an Assistant Professor before receiving tenure and a joint appointment in African-American Studies in 2003. From 2003‚Äì2006 and 2014‚Äì2016, Johnson served as the Director of Graduate Studies for the Department of Performance Studies. Later, he would also serve as the Chair of Performance Studies from 2006‚Äì2011. Johnson was promoted to Full Professor of African-American Studies and Performance Studies in 2007 before becoming the Carlos Montezuma Professor of African-American Studies and Performance Studies in 2011. He currently serves as the Chair of the African-American Studies Department. Influence Johnson's introduction of \\"quare\\" as a theoretical concept became particularly influential in the fields of queer theory, women, gender and sexuality and black studies. Originally published in Text & Performance Quarterly, \\"Quare' Studies Or (Almost) Everything I Know About Queer Studies I Learned From My Grandmother\\" went on to be reprinted numerous times. \\"Quare\\" signaled a significant departure from the lack of engagement with race and class by queer theorists and with gender and sexuality among black studies scholars. Conceptually, \\"Quare\\" took seriously the lived experiences and knowledge of black queer people and such an understanding necessitated a shift toward enabling black queer people to articulate their own identities, knowledge and experiences. Further, the manner in which Johnson wrote the article blurs the line between art and scholarship as the article employs prose, poetry and theoretical ideas simultaneously. In 2000, Johnson convened the Black Queer Studies in the Millennium Conference which served as the beginning of black queer studies as a field. Research Johnson's first book, Appropriating Blackness: Performance and the Politics of Authenticity, examines how blackness is appropriated and performed‚Äîtoward widely divergent ends‚Äîboth within and outside African American culture and won the Lilla A. Heston Award and the Errol Hill Award. His second book, Sweet Tea: Black Gay Men of the South‚ÄîAn Oral History (2008) is an ethnographic oral history of the lives of black gay men in the US South, a traditionally uninterrogated region. This book got the Stonewall Book Award from the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Round Table of the American Library Association. Published in 2005 with Mae G. Henderson, Black Queer Studies: A Critical Anthology interrogates the experiences of black queer people whose subjectivities, beliefs, struggles, triumphs and desires had not previously been interrogated by either Queer Theory or Black Studies. The anthology includes writings from scholars including Cathy Cohen, Kara Keeling, Roderick Ferguson, Rinaldo Walcott and Dwight McBride. Published in 2014 with Ramon H. Rivera-Servera, solo/black/woman: scripts, interviews and essays is a collection of writings that feature seven solo performances by emerging and established feminist performance artists from the past three decades. The book received an Honorable Mention for the Errol Hill Book Award. In 2013, Johnson published Cultural Struggles: Performance, Ethnography, Praxis, an edited collection of essays written by Dwight Conquergood. Conquergood selected Johnson to publish his work before his death in 2004. Conquergood was an ethnographer in the field of performance studies whose ethnographic methods focused on power, privilege and researcher reflexivity/responsibility. Published in 2016, No Tea, No Shade: New Writings in Black Queer Studies features the next generation of black queer theorists who follow in the lineage of writings in Black Queer Studies: A Critical Anthology. The text was a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award and features writings by Amber Jamilla Musser, Omise'eke Natasha Tinsley, Jafari Sinclaire Allen, Lyndon Gill and Marlon M. Bailey. Published in 2016, Blacktino Queer Performance (with Ramon H. Rivera-Servera) is a collection of nine performance scripts by established and emerging black and Latina/o queer playwrights and performance artists. Each script is accompanied by an interview and critical essay by scholars across a range of interdisciplinary fields. Black. Queer. Southern. Women‚ÄîAn Oral History is a forthcoming text examining the experiences of black women who love other women and live in the US South. In this text, Johnson employed similar methods (ethnographic oral history) as he did in Sweet Tea. Creative scholarship =Sweet Tea‚ÄîThe Play = Inspired to present a more comprehensive version of Sweet Tea and the men that Johnson interviewed, in 2006 he created a solo Reader's Theater performance, called Pouring Tea: Black Gay Men of the South Tell Their Tales, based on selected stories of the men that he interviewed. Pouring Tea toured across the country to over 100 universities, conferences and events over a decade. In 2010, in collaboration with Jane M. Saks, Columbia College and About Face Theatre Company in Chicago, Johnson developed the show into full production called Sweet Tea‚ÄîThe Play. After its Chicago debut, the show traveled to Austin, Texas to the Warfield Center (2010), Signature Theater in Arlington, Virginia in 2011; Dixon Place in New York City (2012), the Durham Arts Council (2014), Rites and Reasons Theater in Providence, Rhode Island (2014), Towne Street Theater in Hollywood, California (2015), Northwestern University's Wirtz Center (2015), and to the National Black Theater Festival in Winston-Salem, NC (2015). Johnson won the Black Theater Alliance Bert Williams Award for Best Solo Performance for the show in 2010. = Honey Pot = This text (2019) is the creative nonfiction companion to Black. Queer.

This wood pigeon was endemic to the Laurel forest habitat. Generality It is an extinct species of pigeon that was endemic to islands in the Okinawa archipelago south-west of the Japanese mainland. In the Okinawa group, it has been recorded from Iheyajima, Izenajima, Okinawa proper and the nearby islet Yagachijima. In the Kerama Retto to the west of Okinawa, it was found on Zamamijima, whereas in the Dait≈ç group, some 300 km to the SE of Okinawa, it occurred on both major islets, Kita Dait≈çjima and Minami Dait≈çjima. In earlier times, it was most likely also found on other islands near Okinawa, such as Iejima. The species' scientific name honors Stejneger's friend, the specimen collector Pierre Louis Jouy. Extinction Like all species of Japanese wood pigeons, the Ryukyu wood pigeon was very susceptible to habitat destruction. It required substantial areas of undisturbed subtropical forest to thrive. Iejima, for example, was largely deforested for settlement and agriculture even before scientific exploration began, which explains the absence of records from this island. The species was last recorded on Okinawa in 1904, probably succumbing to hunting. In the Dait≈ç group, it disappeared after 1936 due to these small islands being completely deforested by settlement and construction activity prior to World War II. It was presumed to continue to exist on the outlying islands in the Okinawa group, but has never been found again. Theoretically, there is sufficient habitat remaining in the mountains of Okinawa. Still, the military activity during World War II and hunting by the Japanese garrison would probably have yielded sightings, if birds still had existed there. More puzzling is the absence of any records from Tokashikijima in the Kerama Retto, which, despite being small, has still mostly intact forest cover even today; Zamamijima, where the species is known to have occurred is smaller still and situated farther away from the Okinawan mainland.

The horse gained nationwide popularity in 2003, not due to her success, but rather, due to a long string of consecutive losses. Background Haru Urara, a bay mare, was foaled on February 27, 1996, on Nobuta Bokujo, Utafue, Mitsuishi, Hokkaido. She was sired by Nippo Teio, a top-class racehorse whose wins included the Tenno Sho and the Yasuda Kinen. Unable to find a buyer for their filly, the farm began training Haru Urara as a racehorse, under their own ownership. Racing career At her debut, on November 17, 1998 at the K≈çchi Racetrack, Haru Urara lost, placing fifth--and last. Over the next four-and-a-half years, she would compete once or twice every month, but was unable to obtain a single victory. In June 2003, after garnering her 80th consecutive loss, the story was picked up by the national Japanese media, making \\"Haru Urara\\" a household name. She quickly became very popular in Japan, and was called , for continuing to run with all her heart, despite her seemingly endless losing streak. This surge in popularity was dubbed \\"The Haru Urara Boom\\", and news about Haru Urara even reached the international community, being reported in the United States, Canada, Germany and elsewhere. During the boom, Haru Urara betting tickets began to be used as o-mamori, particularly for protection against traffic accidents: the word in Japanese can mean both \\"to lose a bet\\" and \\"to avoid being struck\\", so it was said that a Haru Urara betting ticket--a guaranteed loss--could protect the owner's car from being hit. In September 2003, the K≈çchi Prefecture Horse Racing Association introduced a service wherein they would stamp the word on any betting ticket related to Haru Urara. O-mamori were also created from mane and tail hairs that were said to have fallen out during brushing, but production was soon halted, due to concerns expressed by animal welfare groups. At a race held on March 22, 2004, during the peak of her popularity, more than 13,000 spectators packed the Kochi Racetrack, 3,000 of whom had gathered outside before the gates opened, forcing the track to open 30 minutes earlier than scheduled. Some people waited in line for up to five hours to buy tickets at the \\"Haru Urara Commemorative Ticket Booth\\", which was established especially for the event. Fans bet a grand total of ¬•121,751,200 on a Haru Urara victory, an impressive sum, particularly for a horse that had not won once in more than 100 attempts. The race ended in disappointment, but not surprise: despite being ridden by Japan's premier jockey, Yutaka Take, Haru Urara earned her 106th consecutive loss, placing 10th among 11 horses running. Numerous products using Haru Urara's name or image have been produced, including stuffed toys, key rings, mobile phone straps, stickers, stamps, train tickets, rice, shochu, hats, T-shirts and bras. A number of books and songs, as well as a movie, were also written about Haru Urara during the boom period. The Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said \\"I'd like to see Haru Urara win, even just once.

She was helped in her modelling career by supermodel Kate Moss, who chose her as the cover model for an issue of Vogue: Paris and who also made her the face of her clothing line Topshop. As a musician, she is closely associated with Pete Doherty, to whom she was engaged twice, but never married. Her debut album Some Place Along the Way was produced by Sean Lennon.  Early life  LƒÉzƒÉreanu was born in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, and at age 5, immigrated to Canada, settling into the Montreal suburb of Saint-Hubert, Quebec with her parents. At the age of 13, she moved to London to study ballet until she was derailed by a broken knee. She met Pete Doherty at the age of 15 whom she later dated briefly and was engaged to in 2007.  Modeling career  At age 17 LƒÉzƒÉreanu attended an open call and signed with Giovanni modelling agency in Montreal with the hopes that it would help pay rent. From then on she did the usual rounds of London and Paris, occasionally appearing in Barcelona, Australia and Madrid fashion weeks. She was chosen by acquaintance Kate Moss to model for the December/January 2005/2006 issue of Vogue: Paris, which Moss guest edited. Immediately after, she also appeared on the cover of Vogue Italia's January 2006 issue, photographed by Steven Meisel. LƒÉzƒÉreanu has since become an increasingly popular fashion model, breaking the record for most runway work in one season. She has modelled for many top designers, including Chanel, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen, Anna Sui, Lanvin, Versace, and many more. She is affiliated with the modeling agencies The Society Management in New York City, Elite Model Management in Paris, Why Not Models in Milan, and Select Model Management in London. In March 2007, LƒÉzƒÉreanu was chosen by Kate Moss as the model for her new Topshop clothing range.  Personal style  LƒÉzƒÉreanu is known for her quirky, vintage-inspired style ‚Äì which has arguably contributed to the rise of her modelling career. When asked about her style, LƒÉzƒÉreanu says: \\"I‚Äôm very influenced by the whole 1960s‚Äì1970s London era, not only in terms of my clothes but also in terms of the music I listen to, the movies I watch, the writers I read. Those influences probably translates into my personal style in an unconscious way.\\" Michelle McCool of Cosmopolitan magazine writes that \\"(Irina) has a great rock'n'roll vibe. It's all about the hair and her flatness. I love that she has no boobs.\\" LƒÉzƒÉreanu is often described as having a distinctive look, as Emmanuelle Alt of Vogue Paris adds; \\"On the runway, no matter what, she cannot be transformed. She always has her unique look and style.\\" As a result of her striking features and rock'n'roll semblance, LƒÉzƒÉreanu has developed the status of 'official muse' to designers Nicolas Ghesqui√®re and Karl Lagerfeld, with whom she shot the Chanel Cruise campaign.  Music career  LƒÉzƒÉreanu met musician Pete Doherty then a member of the Libertines, at a party in Shepherd's Bush while she was a ballet student. Doherty and LƒÉzƒÉreanu bonded over their shared interest in artists such as Oscar Wilde and Nina Simone. LƒÉzƒÉreanu became closely involved with Doherty's band Babyshambles and toured with them in 2004, although she has denied the widespread rumor that she served as their drummer. LƒÉzƒÉreanu reportedly helped Doherty write the song \\"La Belle et la B√™te\\" which featured Kate Moss on the Babyshambles' Down in Albion album. She recorded a folk album, entitled Some Place Along the Way, which musician Sean Lennon produced and collaborated on. It was to be released in late 2006 but was delayed until 2010. LƒÉzƒÉreanu has said that \\"My music isn't commercial...I just want to learn from people and do the best I can do\\" and cites Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Leonard Cohen and Joan Baez as her musical influences. In February 2007 LƒÉzƒÉreanu announced that she will collaborate with Sean Lennon and Pete Doherty on a cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Girl from the North Country\\". In December 2007, during a special presentation for Chanel in London, LƒÉzƒÉreanu debuted four songs off her album, which acted as the soundtrack to the show. Sean Lennon accompanied her on guitar. In June 2010 LƒÉzƒÉreanu organized a benefit concert in NYC and was set to perform with Doherty, Lennon, Charlotte Kemp Muhl, and Adam Green. Doherty was, however, refused entry into the United States ‚Äì despite having a visa. The band played without him.  Personal life  LƒÉzƒÉreanu has twice been briefly engaged to musician Pete Doherty, first for a period in 2004 following the break-up of his band The Libertines< and then for the second time in October 2007.

Known as Juan Smith, he plays as a blindside flanker, although he has also played number eight. Career Smith made his international debut for South Africa on 7 June 2003 as a reserve in the 29‚Äì25 victory over Scotland at Kings Park Stadium in Durban. He was also named in the Springboks' team for the second Scottish Test the following week. He then played at number 8 during the 2003 Tri Nations Series against Australia and the All Blacks. Smith was included in the Springboks squad for the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia. He played in four matches at the World Cup and scored a try in the match against Manu Samoa. Although he only played the one Test for South Africa during 2004 ‚Äì against Wales at Millennium Stadium in Cardiff in November, he was capped 10 times for the Springboks the following season. He was a reserve in matches against Uruguay and France, before being moving up into the starting line-up again as a flanker for the 2005 Tri Nations Series. The Free State Cheetahs made it to the 2005 Currie Cup final, where they defeated the Blue Bulls to win the championship. He then played in the 20‚Äì16 loss against France at Stade de France in Paris. The Cheetahs gained entrance into the Super 14, and competed in the 2006 season. Smith captained the side, which ended up doing remarkably well for a new team, and the Cheetahs finished above the other new team, the Western Force, as well as three other Super 14 teams. He played in the 2006 mid-year rugby tests wins over Scotland, as well as the loss against France in South Africa, then being named in the Springboks' 2006 Tri Nations Series squad. Smith was a key part of the World Cup-winning team to lift the Webb Ellis trophy in 2007. Although Smith wears the number seven on the back of his shirt, implying that he is an open side flanker, he is actually a blindside flanker, as the custom in South Africa is for openside to wear the number six rather than seven. Renowned for his strong ball carrying, Smith is one of the best blindside flankers in the world. On 25 February 2011, in a Super Rugby match against the Bulls in Bloemfontein, Smith tore his Achilles tendon, which caused him to miss the rest of the 2011 Super Rugby season, as well as the Tri Nations and the 2011 Rugby World Cup. In April 2012, Smith announced that he would be taking an indefinite break from rugby due to the ongoing battle with his Achilles injury. He had had four operations on the injury but was concerned that the recovery was taking longer than he had hoped. \\"The right thing to do now is to give my injury sufficient time to heal 100%,\\" Smith said in an interview with the Volksblad newspaper. Despite making his long-awaited comeback for the playing against the in a pre-season game in February 2013, the results of a subsequent MRI scan forced Smith to announce his retirement from the game. On 10 September 2013 it was announced that Smith had been persuaded to come out of retirement and had signed a deal with RC Toulonnais. Smith's 2013 season return to rugby resembles a fairytale story. Returning from a career ending injury to an unprecedentedly successful season, Toulon won the Heineken Cup, becoming only the third team ever to retain the title. On 24 May 2014, Smith scored the decisive try in the 60th minute of the final against Saracens. He also played a crucial part in the final of the French Top 14 a week later on 31 May 2014, in which Toulon defeated Castres Olympique to win the title for the first time since 1992.http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/match_report/0,,11069_65529_1,00.html Subsequently, and capping a remarkable comeback year, on 6 August 2014, Smith was recalled to the Springboks team for the Rugby Championship against New Zealand, Australia and Argentina. In 2015 Smith again won the European Rugby Champions Cup with Toulon.

Best known for his work with the Straitjacket Fits, he later led the band Bike. In 1996 he was shortlisted for the APRA Silver Scroll and in 2008 he was inducted into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame.  Early life  Brough was born in Wellington in 1963, the eldest of four children of former missionary Gordon Brough and his wife Catherine. The family moved to Dargaville in the Northland Region when Andrew was about three, and later to Christchurch. Andrew's parents separated in the early 1970s, with Gordon moving south to Dunedin. Andrew joined him around 1974, with his siblings (two boys and a girl) staying in Christchurch, and would attend Logan Park High School.  The Blue Meanies and The Orange  Brough, who had always been a keen singer, began his rock music career as the singer for university student band The Blue Meanies, alongside Martin Kean on bass, Max Satchell on guitar and Richard Allen on drums. They were regular performers at venues like Dunedin's Empire Tavern, but didn't leave behind any studio recordings. At the time, Brough was influenced by 1960s pop. \\"I spent three or four years listening to that music after I left school. [...] In the sixties they had a strong sense of melody, which influenced me a lot.\\" Following the demise of The Blue Meanies, Brough formed the Dunedin sound three-piece The Orange with Jonathan Moore (bass, formerly of Bored Games) and Peter Bragan (drums) in 1984. He had \\"hated just being a frontman\\", so played guitar as well as singing with The Orange. They played gigs in Dunedin at venues including the Oriental Tavern, where a live recording of the song 'Number One' was made in 1985. It was included in a local compilation tape, Whistle Up A Wind, the next year. Their only studio recording, a five-track EP entitled Fruit Salad Lives, was released by Flying Nun Records shortly before the band broke up in 1986. Writing under the pseudonym 'Buffy O'Reilly', Shayne Carter said that \\"Brough's airy vocals and melodic, unabrasive guitar lends the five track EP a floating, almost Chilly quality.\\" Later that year, The Orange disbanded when Brough and Carter became bandmates.  Straitjacket Fits (1986‚Äì1991) Brough became better known as guitarist and vocalist alongside Shayne Carter in Straitjacket Fits, a role he held from 1986 (prior to that band's first release) until 1991, when he left the group following the tour to support their second album, Melt. In his book, Dead People I Have Known, Carter writes that Straitjacket Fits began as a three-piece, with a mutual friend recommending Brough as a fourth member. ‚Ä≥Andrew seemed a good fit for our band, because I really wanted to have harmonies and another singer, like in The Beatles. The first time Andrew stepped on the mic and played his round, Revolver guitar, we knew we'd hit on a sound.\\" Shayne Carter and Andrew Brough were often likened to Lennon and McCartney ‚Äì a pair of songwriting, guitar-playing bandmates with different styles (one tending towards pop and the other more aggressive), which made for a successful musical collaboration but a difficult personal dynamic. Brough was a regular backing vocalist, his voice providing a contrasting counterpoint to Carter's. In his five years with the band he wrote and sang seven songs. =Life in One Chord EP (1987)= 'Sparkle That Shines' was on the band's debut release, the Life in One Chord EP (1987), and also the UK/US version of Hail (1988). Looking back on the song, Brough said \\"I don‚Äôt like the singing so much [...] because it‚Äôs quite pompous and young. [...] I remember in the studio when it was coming together, you could tell that it was going to work.\\" But he liked the band's first recording: \\"The first EP, I was really proud of. I was thinking, 'Shit, I‚Äôm on that! I was part of that', it was good.\\" =Hail and touring (1988‚Äì1989)= 'Take From the Years' and 'Fabulous Things' are found on all versions of Hail (the New Zealand version didn't include 'Sparkle That Shines', but the US/UK one did). Brough said that the album \\"didn‚Äôt come to fruition musically. It wasn‚Äôt something I was proud of. [...] I did two songs on that Hail record, and I didn‚Äôt like either of them very much.\\" In 1989 Straitjacket Fits toured overseas for the first time, visiting the USA and Europe. \\"For me it was just a big holiday, to see the world. I was so into American movies and American culture [...] It didn‚Äôt bother me if we didn‚Äôt have a good gig or not, we were there, doing it!\\" =Melt (1990)= Melt (1990) included 'Down in Splendour', 'Such a Daze', and 'Hand in Mine'. Another Brough song, 'In Spite of it All', was recorded during sessions for Melt and included on the Missing From Melt EP (it was also the b-side of the 'Bad Note For a Heart' single). 'Down in Splendour' was released as a single (Audioculture calls it \\"the most radio and record company friendly track on the album\\") and became Brough's most successful Straitjacket Fits song. In 2001, it was voted 32nd in the APRA Top 100 New Zealand Songs of All Time. =Departure (1991) and recognition (2008)= Brough's time with Straitjacket Fits ended after the band toured North America in 1991, when he \\"thought that musically I wasn't achieving what I wanted to achieve\\". Their American label, Arista, wanted more Brough songs from the band and Brough himself also wanted to write more. The other three members of the band preferred Carter's heavier numbers. There had been \\"a good tension\\" between the two songwriters, but \\"the last few weeks of that American tour were quite argumentative.\\" Carter believed that Brough had stopped committing to the band: \\"Andrew went off on a really weird trip, and completely dark-manned out. He wasn‚Äôt trying at gigs, he would actually give up on stage, we‚Äôd be playing a show, and look across at this dude who was sitting there. It just became impossible to work together, and it was no fun either.\\" In a 2008 interview, bassist David Wood said that Shayne Carter and Andrew Brough had \\"no relationship\\" and \\"the two did not work closely together\\". Brough left Auckland and moved to Dunedin. Mark Peterson replaced him and was a member of Straitjacket Fits until their split in 1994. While a lot of focus was given to the tension between them, Shayne Carter has written that they also had a lot of common ground. He praised the melody and extra dimension Brough brought to the band, and wrote that Straitjacket Fits \\"never worked as well\\" and \\"became a plainer band\\" without Brough. Brough was invited but did not take part in a Straitjacket Fits reunion in 2005. In September 2008 all five band members, including Brough, received the Legacy Award at the New Zealand Music Awards, and were inducted into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame at the APRA Silver Scroll Awards.  Bike (1992‚Äì1998) After leaving Straitjacket Fits Brough moved to Dunedin, then Auckland. In Dunedin he spent 6 months writing songs, then re-emerged fronting a group known as Tumble before switching the name to Bike (inspired by the 1967 Pink Floyd song of the same name). Brough's new band played their first show in Dunedin in October 1992, supporting The Verlaines. In Auckland he put together Bike's first acknowledged line-up, finding drummer Karl Buckley through an advertisement, then recruiting bassist Tristan Mason through a family connection of Buckley's. (Buckley was later replaced by Wayne Bell, then Bevan Sweeney). Bike was deliberately designed as a vehicle for Brough's songs. After being a minority contributor to Straitjacket Fits he wanted to \\"be in charge of a band where I have to write music\\". Brough described Bike's sound as \\"powerful pop songs\\", while others used descriptions like \\"soothing, cheerful and sunny\\". Dave Eggleton, in Ready To Fly, said \\"Bike's sound was a homage to 1960's psychedalia\\". Bike first toured New Zealand in 1994, having already been offered an album deal by Flying Nun but not yet released any music. Their first song to be released was \\"My Love, My Life\\", on 1995 Abba tribute album Abbasalutely. Brough described the song as, \\"drippy - yes but with a worthy enough hook to throw some guitars at.\\"Liner notes, Abbasalutely, Flying Nun Records FNCD315 D31437, 1995 Bike released a self-titled EP in 1996: the song 'Save My Life', was a songwriting finalist at the 1996 APRA Silver Scrolls, and Bike was nominated as 'most promising new band' at the New Zealand Music Awards. =Take in the Sun = 'Save My Life' was followed up with the single 'Circus Kids' in 1997, and a debut record, Take in the Sun, later that year. Through the previous years of writing, rehearsing and touring, Brough had a clear template for the album before recording began. \\"The fact that most of the songs were demoed to death in the proceeding couple of years, meant that going into the studio, I had it fairly well worked out what it was going to sound like in the end, just through a lot of four-track demoing.\\" While the album was funded by Mushroom Records, like all of Bike's material it was released by Flying Nun Records. The American version of the album, part of the March Records catalogue, had a slightly altered cover with different typography. Take in the Sun made the New Zealand album charts, at number 47, in October 1997. The band toured New Zealand and overseas to support the release, while Brough was featured on the covers of magazines including Pavement and Real Groove. Increased media attention, including a large photo in a Sunday newspaper, led Brough to worry about being \\"recognised in the street\\". The video for Welcome to My World featured Shayne Carter, Brough's old Straitjacket Fits bandmate, as a policeman. Along with the Circus Kids video, it was directed by Jonathan King. The Save My Life video was directed by Mark Tierney. Bike's music was sometimes heard in the background of television soaps including Australia's Home and Away. This was believed to be main source of Brough's music-related income. As long-time broadcaster Jonathan Alley of RRR recounts, \\"After a Bike song was licensed for use on television, it created [for] Andrew a bit of windfall and with that money he brought a house.\\" Andy Dandy (2000) The last Andrew Brough song to be released was a version of James K. Baxter's poem Andy Dandy. It was made especially for the 2000 album Baxter. Brough's was one of 12 contributions to the project, which was conceived and managed by musician Charlotte Yates. He was initially reluctant to accept her invitation to be a part of Baxter, and chose not to appear at the accompanying concert. Music critic Graham Reid said that \\"Andrew Brough has taken one of Baxter's children's poems and turned it into an archetypical dreamscape of layered guitars.\\" Death Brough died in Dunedin on 2 February 2020. Public reports of his death were first made two days later, on 4 February. He was 56 years old.

He currently performs with heavy metal band Circle II Circle. Stevens is also a drummer and has a degree in psychology but is not, as is often reported, a licensed, practicing psychologist. Career Stevens first achieved fame singing for a band called Wicked Witch. However, after Savatage co-founder Jon Oliva stepped down from the fore of the band at the conclusion of their tour in support of Streets: A Rock Opera in 1992 to concentrate on other projects, namely his other band Doctor Butcher and a Broadway-bound musical entitled Romanov, Savatage required a replacement. Jon hand-picked his replacement, who was discovered and introduced to the band by Criss Oliva's best friend and guitar technician Savatage's lead guitarist, and their long-time producer Paul O'Neill heard demos of Stevens and wanted him to sing for the band. After an initial audition, Stevens was considered to be the right man for the job and joined Savatage in 1993. He first appeared on the album Edge of Thorns. Stevens's vocals were considered to be a departure from that of Jon Oliva, and some Savatage fans prefer to distinguish between the Jon Oliva lead albums and those with Stevens on lead vocals. The album Dead Winter Dead contains lead vocals from both Oliva and Stevens and contains the song \\"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\\", which gave rise to and became a hit for the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. In 1996, Stevens appeared along with other Savatage members in the Trans-Siberian Orchestra project. His last album recorded with Savatage was The Wake of Magellan (1997), which some fans consider to be Savatage's best work in the post-1993 Savatage canon. In 2000, Stevens quit Savatage, citing that he wanted to spend more time with his young family. During the winter of 2001, Zak started his comeback. His Savatage connections remained evident, as Jon Oliva produced the first Circle II Circle album, Watching in Silence, and guitarist Chris Caffery recorded guitar on some songs. Oliva and Caffery also co-wrote several of the songs on Watching in Silence. In 2003, Stevens's band left Circle II Circle to join Jon Oliva's band Pain. Stevens then hired an all-new band. Circle II Circle has released three additional full-length albums since, 2005's The Middle of Nowhere, Burden of Truth in 2006, and Delusions of Grandeur in 2008. In April 2014 \\"Ancient Rites of the Moon\\", the first album of the Stardust Reverie Project (Graham Bonnet, Lynn Meredith, Bill Hudson and Melissa Ferlaak), was released. \\"Mighty Roar\\" becomes one of Stevens' most impressive songs to date. During several gigs with Circle II Circle, not only were certain Savatage songs played but also entire albums featuring Stevens, among them The Wake of Magellan and Edge of Thorns.

The Digital Monster is a digital pet released in 1997 by Bandai. This pet was a masculine counterpart to the Tamagotchi, which was deemed more appropriate for girls. It spawned the Digimon franchise. It was similar to earlier virtual pets with the distinctions of being a fighting pet that could connect with others like it. The original Digital Monster model that was released in 1997 sold units worldwide, including in Japan and overseas, up until March 2004. By 2005, more than Digital Monster units had been sold. In 2017, a 20th anniversary edition was released in Japan which allows the owner to choose from any of the eggs from the first 5 versions of the original toy, as well as several new ones unlocked through various methods. This edition was released worldwide in 2019, the anniversary of the franchise outside of its home country. Gameplay The Digimon game consists of the following functions: * Checking the pet's status (age, weight, strength, hunger and energy) * Feeding the Digimon to increase the pet's fullness, strength, and energy * Training the Digimon to lose weight and increase strength * Battle mode (once activated, the owner can link their console to another owner's Digimon and begin a battle) * Cleaning up the Digimon's droppings (leaving droppings uncleaned for too long causes the Digimon to become ill) * Toggling the light. If the Digimon fell asleep and the light was never turned off, its overall condition (an unviewable stat) would decrease, and its chances of a high-power evolution would decrease. * Healing the Digimon. If the Digimon got sick or injured in battle, it would have to be healed before it could battle again. Device operation The original Digimon Device has three buttons and one reset button, located to the right of the screen. The top \\"A\\" button scrolls through the icons and options on the screens. The middle \\"B\\" button activates the selected function. The bottom \\"C\\" button cancels out whatever is on the screen. Pressing \\"A\\" and \\"C\\" simultaneously toggles the sound. The reset button could only be pressed with a pen or other sharp object. Changes for US market When the product brought to the US, elements such as the \\"Megalithic Mainframe\\" were added to soften the concept of death (thus Digimon cannot die, but instead return to a fictional world). Devimon was renamed Darkmon because of censorship and the Japanese-related reference in Monzaemon's name was removed in favor of Teddymon. These names were never used in the franchise again, as the games and anime would use Devimon and Monzaemon. Digimon Pendulums =Original Pendulum series= In 1998, Bandai released a follow-up virtual pet series known as Pendulums which features higher evolution levels and is the first to introduce the Jogress function which enable combination between certain type of digimons. The pendulum is used to count the number of times the device has been shaken. Five versions of the Digimon Pendulum were released which is Nature Spirit for version 1, Deep Savers for version 2, Nightmare Soldier for version 3, Wind Guardian for version 4 and finally Metal Empire for version 5. Each of these being followed by a 0.5 version which contained a slightly- altered character lineup. A Version 0 representing Virus Busters was also later released. =Pendulum Progress series= Pendulum Progress was the successor of the original Pendulum series. There are three in total; the Pendulum Progress is an upgrade similar to the Tamagotchi Connection. The character lineup on each is expanded and it retains the pendulum feature that became a series standard; it also has the ability to have the current monster fight a computer monster in battle as opposed to linking up with another device. =Pendulum X series= The successor of the Pendulum Progress, the Pendulum X series, was released in 2003. It combined the RPG elements of the Digivice games with the standard pet-raising. Unlike its predecessors, the Pendulum X line was accompanied by a story titled , which was told mostly through prose text interspersed with short, non-sequitur six-page manga comics printed in the booklets. There were four \\"chapters\\", one sold with each progressive version of the Pendulum X. Plot In this storyline, the Digital World is controlled by an intelligent computer named Yggdrasil. Digimon have multiplied so much that Yggdrasil is unable to handle the load and the Digital Hazard occurs. This leads to the creation of the \\"New Digital World\\", which consists of three layers known as Urd (past), Versandi (present), and Skuld (future). Yggdrasil then lets loose the Project Ark as well as the X Program to eliminate any Digimon it no longer wants. However, some Digimon adapt by obtaining a program called the X-Antibody, which strengthens them, changes their appearances, and immunizes them against the X Program. Yggdrasil sends in the thirteen Royal Knights to keep order in the Digital World. After that, three human boys, Kouta, Yuuji, and Shinji, find their way into the Digital World and meet their respective partner Digimon, Dorumon, Ryuudamon and Omnimon X. Kouta and Yuuji resist Yggdrasil and the Royal Knights, while Shinji sides with the computer and the thirteen Digimon. 15 years later, in 2019, the Manga received a sequel titled \\"Digimon Chronicle X\\", which followed the story of the Royal Knights and Seven Great Demon Lords fighting against each other in their X forms. Digimon Mini The Digimon Mini is modeled similarly to the original pets but at a much smaller size. The character set has been minimized and functions are limited. For example, there is no status screen to view the Digimon's hunger. The player must simply feed it when it is hungry. The Mini also uses the three-prong connector; it is thus compatible with the Pendulum X, the Digimon Accelerator, and the Digimon iC. The third Mini updates the character roster, expanding the available Digimon from 13 to 18. WonderSwan Digital Monster Ver. WonderSwan is a Japanese handheld version of the original Digimon pet for the WonderSwan. It includes all of the original Digimon from the first four virtual pet devices and the first pendulum device. In this game the player can have up to eight different Digimon with them at a time. It has computer-controlled opponents to battle with. The game has the ability to connect to another WonderSwan through a special link cable. It can also hook up to the original pets through a Digimon \\"dock N rock\\" connector.

He held charge of Multan, Samana, and Sivistan at various times during Alauddin's reign. Associated with Alauddin since the latter's days as a governor of Kara, Zafar Khan led a major division of Alauddin's army from Kara to Delhi after Alauddin assassinated his predecessor Jalaluddin in 1296. Along with Alauddin's brother Ulugh Khan, he led the army that invaded Multan to eliminate the surviving members of Jalaluddin's family. Zafar Khan, along with Ulugh Khan, probably led the Delhi army that inflicted a crushing defeat on the Chagatai Mongol invaders at Jaran Manjur in 1298. Later that year, Alauddin dispatched Zafar Khan to recapture Sivistan, which had been occupied by Mongol invaders. Zafar Khan decisively defeated the invaders, and took their leader to Delhi as a prisoner. In 1299, he was killed in the Battle of Kili against the Mongol invaders led by Qutlugh Khwaja. Before being killed in action, he inflicted heavy casualties on the Mongols, which was an important factor in the subsequent Mongol retreat. However, his legacy was not recognized in the Sultanate's chronicles, as he had disobeyed Alauddin's orders in recklessly attacking the Mongols during the battle.  Early career  Little is known about the early life of Hizabruddin Zafar Khan. He was not a Turk and likely an Indian Muslim. The 15th century chronicler, Yahya, says that his original name was Yusuf, and also that he was a son of a sister of Alauddin. The 16th century chronicler \`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni) calls him Badruddin instead of Hizabruddin. Zafar Khan led Alauddin's forces even before Alauddin became the Sultan of Delhi. After Alauddin assassinated his predecessor Jalaluddin at Kara, Zafar Khan led one of Alauddin's two contingents that marched to Delhi. The first contingent was headed by Alauddin and Nusrat Khan; Zafar Khan headed the second contingent that arrived in Delhi via Koil (modern Aligarh). After taking control of the throne in Delhi, Alaudidn appointed Zafar Khan as Ariz-i-Mumalik (Minister of War).  Siege of Multan  After establishing his power in Delhi, Alauddin decided to eliminate Jalaluddin's surviving family members, who were in Multan. In November 1296, he sent a 30,000-40,000-strong army led by his brother Ulugh Khan and Zafar Khan to conquer Multan. The defending forces, facing a certain defeat, surrendered after a short siege. Zafar Khan was later given charge of Multan.  Battle of Jaran Manjur  In the winter of 1297-98, Duwa, the ruler of the Mongol Chagatai Khanate, sent an expedition to the Delhi Sultanate. The army, led by his noyan Kadar, ransacked the Punjab region, advancing up to Kasur. According to Ziauddin Barani, Alauddin dispatched Ulugh Khan and Zafar Khan to check the Mongol invasion. Alauddin's courtier Amir Khusrau omits Zafar Khan's name, but Barani is probably correct. (Zafar Khan's name was omitted in the dynasty's official chronicles because Alauddin was unhappy with his reckless disobedience during the Battle of Kili). The Delhi army decisively defeated Mongols with on 6 February 1298 at Jaran-Manjur, a place located on the banks of the Sutlej River. According to Khusrau, 20,000 Mongols were killed in the battle.  Siege of Sivistan  Zafar Khan subsequently served as Alauddin's governor of Samana in the Punjab region. In 1298-99, a Mongol army (possibly Neguderi fugitives) led by Saldi invaded the Sindh region, and occupied the fort of Sivistan. At this time, a large part of Alauddin's army had marched to Gujarat under Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan. In their absence, Alauddin dispatched Zafar Khan to recapture Sivistan. Despite a barrage of arrows from the Mongols and despite not making use of any siege engines, Zafar Khan's army captured the fort using short ranged weapons like axes, swords, javelins, and spears. Zafar Khan took Saldi and other Mongols to Delhi as prisoners. He was given charge of Sivistan. The victory established Zafar Khan's reputation as a brilliant general. According to the chronicler Ziauddin Barani, Alauddin once thought of establishing a new religion just like Muhammad had established Islam. He compared his four brave and loyal generals (Alp Khan, Nusrat Khan, Ulugh Khan, and Zafar Khan) to Muhammad's Rashidun companions Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali. Barani also states that Zafar Khan's success at Sivistan made both Alauddin and his brother Ulugh Khan jealous. According to Barani, Alauddin thought of sending Zafar Khan away from Delhi, by ordering him to conquer and govern Bengal. Barani also claims that Alauddin and Ulugh Khan made plans to blind or poison Zafar Khan. Historian Banarsi Prasad Saksena doubts the truthfulness of Barani's allegations.  Death at the Battle of Kili  In 1299, a Mongol army from Chagatai Khanate, led by prince Qutlugh Khwaja, invaded India. As the governor of Samana, Zafar Khan challenged them to a battle as they passed through Punjab, but Qutlugh Khwaja refused the offer, declaring that \\"kings only fight kings\\". He asked Zafar to fight under the banner of his master Alauddin at Delhi. The Mongols encamped at Kili near Delhi, and Alauddin personally led a force against the invaders. Zafar Khan was given charge of the Delhi army's right wing, which was supported by Hindu warriors. He was one of the five lead commanders of the Delhi army; the other four being Alauddin, Nusrat Khan, Akat Khan, and Ulugh Khan. Alauddin's strategy was to delay the battle, as he was expecting reinforcements to arrive from his provincial armies, and hoped that scarcity of provisions would ultimately force the Mongols to retreat. He asked his generals not to make a move without his orders, but Zafar Khan disregarded these instructions, and attacked one of the Mongol contingents. The Mongols feigned retreat, tricking Zafar Khan and his cavalry into following them to an isolated location. After covering approximately 55 kilometers, Zafar Khan realized that his infantry had been left behind, and he had only 1,000 horsemen left with him. Another Mongol contingent blocked his return to the Delhi camp. Finding themselves in a tough situation, Zafar Khan and his companions determined that a return to the Delhi camp was not possible, and even if it happened, Alauddin would punish them for disobedience and cowardice. Therefore, they decided to die fighting. According to Ziauddin Barani's Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, Qutlugh Khwaja offered Zafar Khan an opportunity to surrender, promising to give him a bigger position at the Chagatai court than he held at the Delhi court. But Zafar Khan refused this offer. According to the 14th century chronicler Isami, Zafar Khan and his companions managed to kill 5,000 Mongols, while losing only 800. After this, Zafar Khan put up a last stand with his 200 surviving soldiers. After his horse was cut down, he fought on foot, and engaged in a hand-to-hand combat with the Mongol commander Hijlak. He was killed by an arrow that bypassed his armour and pierced his heart. The Mongols ultimately decided to retreat after two days, without any further action on the battlefield. Barani states that the Mongols retreated because of the terror that Zafar Khan's attack had caused among them. According to him, whenever their horses refused to drink water, the Mongols would ask them if they had seen Zafar Khan. The actual reason for the Mongol retreat seems to be that Qutlugh Khwaja was seriously wounded in action.  Legacy  Although Zafar Khan was killed in action, Alauddin resented the fact that he had disobeyed the royal orders. Nobody in the Delhi court praised Zafar Khan's gallantry; on the contrary, Alauddin denounced his recklessness and disobedience. Zafar Khan's name was omitted in the subsequent royal chronicles written during Alauddin's reign. For example, Amir Khusrau's Khazainul Futuh makes no mention of him. While describing the military victories accomplished during Alauddin's reign, Khusrau completely omits the Siege of Sivistan which established Zafar Khan's reputation as a general. However, the battle is mentioned by the later chroniclers such as Ziauddin Barani, Isami and Firishta. In 1301, when Alauddin was at Ranthambore, a group of Zafar Khan's followers helped his officer Malik Hamiduddin suppress Haji Maula's rebellion in Delhi. After Alauddin's death, his son Qutb ud din Mubarak Shah bestowed Zafar Khan's title on Malik Dinar, who had earlier served as the Sultanate's master of the elephants (Shihna-yi pil).

Early years Nordlund was born in √ñvre Stubbersbo, near S√§ter outside Falun. He had two siblings, Joel, an older brother who was a deafmute, and a younger brother named Rickard. Histories are told of the young Nordlund as an odd child who never laughed. In 1882 the family moved to Falun where Nordlund went to school, but being of an impatient nature he never finished school. Instead he took to the road, at first with a classmate who was an orphan, in 1886. Later that year, he was spotted by a friend of his parents in Hedemora, and returned to home. In 1887 he was on the run again, and as a person of both size and strength he had the ability to work, passing as an adult. For a brief period, one and a half years, he worked at a lumber mill in Korsn√§s, which, according to himself, was the only time he tried to live an honest life. Still he gave in to temptation and forged a bill, which got him fired from the lumber mill. His parents had now moved to G√§vle; Nordlund also lived there for a short period of time. Nordlund had gotten used to thieving during his time on the road and in 1891 he was arrested and sentenced to four months in prison for cattle rustling by a court in Ljusdal. Later the same year he received his first long term prison sentence, this time for stealing, when he was sentenced to three years in prison. The prison term was served at the county jail in Malm√∂. In 1895 he received another three-year sentence which was to be served in L√•ngholmen Prison in Stockholm, where he was enrolled as prisoner number two. Due to unruly behaviour in prison and other things he was to serve four years and according to letters written by himself in 1900, it was here his plan for the future took its final and drastic shape. The 20th of April 1900, Nordlund was released from L√•ngholmen and with the help of his younger brother, who was now living in Stockholm and working as a clerk, he went home to G√§vle. As an ex-convict he had difficulties getting a job, so soon he returned to his old life, but this time with a disastrous plan of one final big hit that would solve his problems. The mass murder on the steam boat ferry Prins Carl On the night of 16th and 17 May 1900 Nordlund committed the act that would make him the bogeyman of several years to come, and reserve a place for him in the criminal history of Sweden. He boarded the ferry in Arboga and bought a ticket for Stockholm on the evening with an evil plan. The contents of his luggage were two revolvers, several knives and padlocks, with which he had planned to lock the door to the engine room. His plan was to rob and kill as many people as possible on the ship and steal the ship's register. To avoid early detection he also planned to torch the ship. This plan failed however, partly because scared passengers on the boat managed to attract the attention of another ferry, the \\"K√∂ping\\". Still he managed to commit one of the worst murder sprees in known Swedish history by killing four and wounding nine (of whom 8 survived) and a partly trashed ship. The victims of Nordlund's rampage included the ship's captain (Olof R√∂nngren), a butcher, an old lady, a farmer and a cattle merchant. His plan also failed in the aspect that he did not manage to steal the ship's register, leaving his booty at 845 kronor. He managed to escape from the ship because no one thought that one single man could be strong enough to put one of the life boats in the sea and row away. The next day he was arrested by three police officers at the train station in Skogstorp near Eskilstuna, where he had bought some new clothes earlier and avoided detection. He had planned to take the train to Oxel√∂sund and travel to Copenhagen via Gothenburg. When he was arrested he is supposed to have shouted things like; \\"This was my revenge on humanity\\" and \\"Be glad that you arrested me here ‚Äì if I had gotten on the train several more would have been killed\\". After the arrest \\"The Mass Murderer Nordlund. Sentenced to death!\\" He was put in a holding cell in Eskilstuna, in which the guards were barely able to keep an angry mob from killing him. The 18th of May he wrote a letter to his family, explaining what he had done and that he was the one responsible for the newspaper headlines. The letter was published by the newspapers (both Gefle Dagblad and Aftonbladet). In the letter he wrote that he had to explain himself to someone and that he realised that he would receive only one more sentence, capital punishment. He also told them not to grieve and that he welcomed the end since he never felt that he was a part of the society at all. In court he never tried to act in a manner which would result in a lighter sentence; he never pleaded insanity, he showed no remorse saying only that he regretted not having killed everyone on the ferry. He was sentenced to death and to forever lose all privileges as a citizen for five murders, eight attempted murders and theft. Twice he tried to flee from his cell in V√§ster√•s county jail injuring the jailors with a sharp object that he managed to manufacture in the cell. He attempted to escape once, because he had nothing to lose but to await execution. The act that he committed resulted in a media hysteria comparable to the ones we see today, partly because the ruthlessness of the crimes. Several papers competed with each other on several numbers of victims. In some papers the number of victims was exaggerated, claiming a much larger death toll. Several skillingtryck were made about the events on Prins Carl with songs detailing the horrors of the night of May 17. The execution Nordlund had the possibility of writing a letter to the king, Oscar II, to plead for mercy, which he chose not to do. Strangely enough, he took the time to write a letter to the Supreme Court complaining about the fact that he had been wrongfully sentenced for robbery of people that he did not rob. The Supreme Court wrote in their answer (of November 13) that this was irrelevant and that the sentence passed by the court was correct. While awaiting his execution he met his mother several times (the last time five days before his execution). In addition the priest from L√•ngholmen, August Hylander came to visit him several times. In his final letter to his parents he actually asked the lord for redemption and told his parents good bye. On the morning of December 10 Nordlund was escorted to the prison yard of V√§ster√•s County Jail where he was strapped to a stretcher-resembling block and beheaded by the high executioner Dahlman using a manual blade, rather much resembling a meat cleaver. Nordlund's execution was swift, striking the head off in a single blow. The aftermath The year 1900 was one of the darkest for the people who wanted to abolish capital punishment in Sweden with three executions in the same year, all by decapitation (between 1866 and 1900 there were 11 executions in total). The people who argued that one inherited the role as a criminal and the people who wanted to keep the death penalty used Nordlund as an example of why this penalty was necessary. Abolitionists such as Hjalmar Branting only argued that it was unfortunate that Nordlund had been released from prison. Some have claimed that the way Nordlund acted after being caught is a proof of insanity, and that his lack of empathy for his victims also proves this. It has been said that had he not committed the act in a time when several gruesome murders were committed he would probably have received a lighter sentence (or been sent to an insanity asylum). The claims of insanity and the fact that two of the three persons executed in 1900 were claimed to have been insane, probably had an effect on the justice system with a 10-year stretch of reprieves until the execution of Alfred Ander by guillotine, the last ever in Sweden.

He served as the eighth president of the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod (LCMS) from 1969 to 1981. He was a major figure in the \\"Seminex\\" theological/political controversy, which resulted in a schism in the LCMS during the early 1970s. Career Preus was born on January 8, 1920, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He attended Luther Theological Seminary in Minneapolis, Minnesota, graduating in 1945. While in school he married Delpha Mae Holleque on June 12, 1943. He was ordained a pastor and served several congregations in Minnesota. He received a Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in 1951. In 1958, he moved to Concordia Theological Seminary, then in Springfield, Illinois as a professor. He became the president of the seminary in 1962. In 1969, Preus was elected president of the LCMS, upsetting the incumbent, Oliver R. Harms. Preus represented a theologically more conservative wing of the LCMS, and his administration worked to reverse the policies of the more moderate administration preceding his. In 1973-74, a battle over teachings at the LCMS's flagship seminary, Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, resulted in the suspension of the president of the seminary, John Tietjen, and the walkout of most of seminary's professors and students to form a rival seminary known as Concordia Seminary-in-Exile or Seminex. This resulted in a schism in the LCMS, with a small group eventually leaving the synod to form the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches in 1976. The AELC served as a catalyst for the merger of the moderate and liberal Lutheran churches in the United States into the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in 1988. Preus was named President Emeritus of the LCMS in 1992. He died in Burnsville, Minnesota on August 13, 1994. Scholarship Preus was known as a scholar of the Orthodoxy period of Lutheran history, especially of Lutheran Protestant theologian Martin Chemnitz (1522-1586). He translated many of Chemnitz's works into English, including The Two Natures in Christ (1971), The Lord's Supper (1979), Justification: The Chief Article of Christian Doctrine as Expounded in Loci Theologici (1985), and Loci theologici (1989). His own works include What Stands Between? (1949) and It Is Written (1971). His last work, published in 1994, was a biography of Chemnitz titled The Second Martin: The Life and Theology of Martin Chemnitz. Relatives Preus' grandfather Herman Amberg Preus was an influential Midwestern Norwegian Lutheran seminary professor. His father, Jacob A. O. (\\"Jake\\") Preus, was a politician who served as Minnesota's eighth state auditor and 20th governor in the 1920s. His brother, Robert Preus, was a professor, at the Evangelical Lutheran Synod's Bethany Lutheran Theological Seminary and the LCMS's Concordia Seminary, and later was president of Concordia Theological Seminary in Fort Wayne, Indiana. His son, Jacob A. O. Preus III, was a professor at Concordia Seminary and is the past president of Concordia University in Irvine, California. His cousin David W. Preus served as president/presiding bishop of the American Lutheran Church in the 1970s.

Electric matches use a bridgewire consisting of a heating element to ignite a pyrogen, which is a quantity of readily ignited pyrotechnic initiator composition. Electric matches can be used in any application where source of heat is needed at a precisely controlled point in time, typically to ignite a propellant or explosive. Examples include airbags, pyrotechnics, and military or commercial explosives.  Design  fuse Electric matches consist of two parts, a bridgewire and a pyrogen. The bridgewire is a heating element, typically in the form of a loop or coil of thin wire, which is encased in the pyrogen, which is a quantity of readily ignited pyrotechnic initiator composition. If the pyrogen is sufficiently conductive, it can act as the bridgewire as well. Electric matches also come with provisions for attaching an electric current source, and they may be provided with a protective cover and/or a means to attach them to the device to be ignited. To operate an electric match, a source of electricity of appropriate voltage and current is needed to provide current to the match. When sufficient electric current is passed through the bridgewire, the resistive heating causes the element to rise above the ignition temperature of the pyrogen, and the pyrogen begins to burn. Commercial electric match manufacturers often specify 3 key parameters of an electric match: the resistance (often around 2 Ohm), a recommended firing current (often around 1 A), and a maximum no-fire current. The \\"test\\" button on a firing systems typically tests a setup by sending a current limited to well below the no-fire current (often 0.2 A) to detect common problems (short circuits and disconnected open circuits).  Applications  A partial list of applications is: * Airbag deployment * Pyrotechnics * Military or commercial explosives * Model rocketry * Fireplaces: natural gas, propane * Gas stoves and barbecues Electric matches, or electronic ignition, is used in natural gas and propane fueled commercial and household appliances and amenities. Some examples are gas stoves and barbecues, interior and swimming pool hot water heaters and boilers, fireplaces and garden fire pits, and clothes dryers and central heating systems. Electric matches may be regulated, as they can be used to ignite explosives; for amateur pyrotechnics use, electric matches can be built from scratch or from kit form. Kits include the thin wire needed for the bridgewire, such as nichrome wire, along with components for mixing the pyrogen. Scratch-built matches use thin wire which may be purchased or salvaged from sources such as light bulb filaments, and copper wiring. In addition to the readily ignitable component of the electric match pyrogen, some matches may also add additional components to provide a hotter, longer-lasting flame, for igniting items that are difficult to ignite. For example, igniters for solid fuel model rocket motors often include powdered metals, which provide more heat and duration to the match flame, and a more reliable ignition of the motor.

It hosts collections of holography, technology-related artworks, artificial intelligence, robotics, maritime history, and the history of MIT. Its holography collection of 1800 pieces is the largest in the world, though not all of it is exhibited. , holographic art, and works by the kinetic artist Arthur Ganson are the two largest long- running displays. There is a regular program of temporary special exhibitions, often on the intersections of art and technology. In addition to serving the MIT community, the museum offers numerous outreach programs to school-age children and adults in the public at large. The widely attended annual Cambridge Science Festival was originated by and continues to be coordinated by the museum. A major expansion program is underway, with expected relocation to a new building in the Kendall Square innovation district in late 2021.  History  The museum was founded in 1971 by Warren Seamans, originally as part of an exhibit project of the Office of the President and the Department of Humanities for the inauguration of President Jerome Wiesner. The committee involved was named the \\"Historical Collections\\" in December 1971 and served as the predecessor to the museum. Its purpose was to collect and preserve historical artifacts and documents scattered throughout MIT. It was renamed the \\"MIT Museum\\" in 1980, and began developing exhibits and educational programs for the MIT community as well as society at large. Since 2005 the official mission of the MIT Museum has been, \\"to engage the wider community with MIT‚Äôs science, technology and other areas of scholarship in ways that will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century.\\" The museum is directed by MIT Professor John Durant, and operates under MIT's Associate Provost for the Arts, who also oversees the List Visual Arts Center and the MIT Office of the Arts. Durant is also a faculty member of the MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (SHASS) in its Program in Science, Technology, and Society (STS). He teaches courses on the development of science exhibits and communication between scientists, engineers, and the general public. The museum was accredited by the organization now called the American Alliance of Museums (AAM) in 1984, and reaccredited in 2002 and 2013. The MIT Museum also belongs to the Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC), Museum Computer Network, New England Museum Association, International Confederation of Architectural Museums, and the International Council of Maritime Museums.  Exhibits  The Mark Epstein Innovation Gallery occupies on the ground floor, and showcases recent research at MIT. After dark during the winter season, large holograms from the museum's collection have sometimes been displayed through large windows fronting on Massachusetts Avenue. Other exhibits have included selections from the museum's large collection of slide rules and nomographs, and research archives and camera prototypes from Edwin H. Land and the Polaroid Corporation. The majority of exhibits have been developed by the museum staff, but touring shows are occasionally exhibited, including a European show about the origins and design of everyday technology, such as the adhesive bandage. =Photography= The Kurtz Gallery for Photography on the second floor displays temporary shows of photography related to art, science, and technology, including works connected to MIT and people who have worked or studied there. For example, a photo exhibit of Berenice Abbott's work was on display through 2012, highlighting her scientific visualization work which captured elementary physics principles for science education, including the picture Bouncing ball in diminishing arcs. Many of these photos were incorporated into a landmark high school physics textbook developed by the Physical Science Study Committee, which was headquartered at MIT. The works of scientific photographer Felice Frankel have also been exhibited at the museum. = Kinetic art = One of the most popular permanent galleries features approximately a dozen works of kinetic art by Arthur Ganson. In November 2013, the museum opened 5000 Moving Parts, a year- long exhibition of kinetic art, featuring the work of Ganson, Anne Lilly, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, John Douglas Powers, and Takis. The exhibition inaugurated a \\"year of kinetic art\\" at the museum, featuring special programming related to the artform. = Holography collection = In 1993, the MIT Museum acquired the complete collection and archives of the Museum of Holography (MOH), formerly on Mercer Street in the SoHo district of Manhattan. The MOH had been dissolved the previous year, and the collection was to be dispersed at auction. At that time an anonymous buyer bought the entire collection and donated it to the MIT Museum, which continues to preserve, expand, and display it for researchers and the general public. Today, the collection is the largest and most comprehensive collection of holograms in the world, containing many specimens of historic, scientific, and artistic value. Only a small fraction of the collection is viewable by the public at any given time, due to space and funding constraints. The MIT Museum continues to host occasional international symposia on holography every few years. The contents of the collection may be searched via an online accessible database. = Hacker relics and Building 20 memorial = For a number of years, the museum housed a Hall of Hacks showcasing some of the famous MIT student pranks, but the section was closed in 2001. This was done to free up gallery space for other exhibits; the artifacts and documentation have been retained for future historical research and exhibition. A few selected larger relics of past hacks are now on semi-permanent display inside the MIT Stata Center, including a \\"fire hose\\" drinking fountain, and full-size replicas of a cow and a police car which had been placed atop the Great Dome (but not at the same time); see the MIT hacks article for details. In the ground floor elevator lobby of the Dreyfoos Tower are located a large time capsule box plus informational panels describing MIT's historic Building 20, which was sited where the Stata Center is now. = MIT 150 = In January 2011, the museum reopened its upper galleries, including the Thomas Peterson '57 Gallery, after an extensive renovation. The first exhibit in the renovated space was The MIT 150 Exhibition in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of MIT's founding charter on April 10, 1861. The special exhibit consisted of 150 objects, documents, and other artifacts showing the history of people, places, and ideas related to MIT. A website was set up in tandem, including supplemental information and an online timeline. Video interviews specially created for the exhibition were available for viewing onsite and online. =Student showcase= Inventions: student showcase displays inventions and kinetic art made by MIT students, often as part of coursework such as \\"STS.035 Exhibiting Science\\". Some of these projects were built at the MIT Museum Studio, a makerspace for students, while others were created in a variety of courses and laboratories at MIT.  Programs  The MIT Museum conducts a number of activities for middle and high school students, including group tours and individual events such as workshops, art studios, contests, and performances. Special week-long programming is scheduled for school vacation weeks in February and April. In addition, the museum has regular outreach programs for the adult community, including evening discussion panels and guest appearances by MIT researchers, plus invited artists, historians, and scholars from the world at large. Mature, interested children are usually also welcome at these events, which often focus on new developments and controversies in science, technology, art, and public policy. = Friday After Thanksgiving (F.A.T.) competition = The museum has run an annual \\"Friday After Thanksgiving\\" (F.A.T.) chain reaction, which was emceed by kinetic artists Arthur Ganson and Jeff Lieberman, who also constructed the last contraption in the giant event. Teams of contestants constructed elaborate Rube Goldberg style chain-reaction machines on tables arranged around MIT's gymnasium. Typically, each apparatus would be linked by a string or ramp to its predecessor and successor machine. The initial string was ceremonially pulled, and the ensuing events were videotaped in closeup, and simultaneously projected on large screens for viewing by the live audience. After the entire cascade of events finished, prizes were then awarded in various categories and age levels. Videos from several previous years' contests are viewable on the MIT Museum website. On November 29, 2019, an event billed as \\"FINAL!! Friday After Thanksgiving (F.A.T.) Chain Reaction\\" was held. This was to be the final occurrence of the contest, after more than 20 years of annual restaging. Both Ganson and Lieberman have relocated (separately) outside the Boston area, and nobody has stepped forward to continue organizing the competition. = Cambridge Science Festival = In 2007, John Durant (then the newly appointed Director of the MIT Museum) initiated the annual Cambridge Science Festival. This was the first event of its type in the United States, and has since inspired similar events in other cities, coordinated via the Science Festival Alliance. Durant had been inspired by a similar festival in England, where he had worked previously. MIT, Harvard University, the City of Cambridge, and the Museum of Science, Boston were the founding sponsors of the event, and continue in their support today. All Festival events are open to the general public, and are intended for ages ranging from pre-school up through senior citizens. The great majority of events are free, but some limited performances and workshops require a fee. Information and program schedules are available online, and free printed program booklets are distributed throughout the city before each Festival. The Festival is usually scheduled for around 10 days near the end of April. Location The MIT Museum is located at the northern edge of the main MIT campus in Cambridge. It is served by the MBTA #1 \\"Harvard/Holyoke Gate - Dudley Station via Massachusetts Avenue\\" bus, one of the \\"key bus routes\\" with frequent service and extended hours. The museum is a short walk along Massachusetts Avenue southeast of the Central Square restaurant and nightclub district in the center of Cambridge, served by Central station on the MBTA Red Line subway. The MIT Museum building is readily identified by a large cloth name banner hanging from the front corner of the structure. Visible through large windows near the main entrance are some temporary exhibit and event spaces on the ground floor. The museum store and complimentary lockers for storing personal belongings are located here as well. However, the bulk of the museum is upstairs in an adjacent building, connected by an interior stainless steel stairway. The museum is fully wheelchair accessible. In October 2016, the museum gained a new neighbor located at 301 Massachusetts Avenue, a short distance north. The MIT Press Bookstore, formerly located next to a subway entrance to Kendall/MIT station, was temporarily relocated to Central Square, because of impending construction at its former location. Once major construction is completed in late 2021, the MIT Museum will accompany the bookstore in moving back to Kendall Square, at sites adjacent to a subway entrance to Kendall/MIT station.

A native of Addison, Vermont, he worked in Chicago, New York, and Pittsburgh, in addition to studies and travels in Germany. Between 1868 and 1871, he studied under Theodor Kullak, among others, but he suffered a wrist injury during a lesson, which prevented his becoming a professional concert pianist. On a later trip to Germany, following a performance of Pratt's works, Franz Liszt gave him encouragement and advice. Pratt is known to have completed at least three operas, one of which he later revised; only two were ever performed. His musical allegory, The Triumph of Columbus, was composed for the quadricentennial of Columbus's discovery of the New World, and was performed at Carnegie Hall on 10 October 1892. Among his other compositions was a symphony about the sinking of the Titanic, completed in June 1913. He was also the first composer to set \\"America the Beautiful\\". Pratt is known to have taught piano for a time in Joliet, Illinois. In 1895, he was appointed principal of the West End School of Music in New York. He later moved to Pittsburgh, and established the Pratt Institute of Music and Art in 1906; he served as the Institute's president until his death in 1916. He was buried in Chicago. Pratt is said to have once met Richard Wagner, who called him the \\"Richard Wagner of the United States\\"; reportedly, Pratt then responded that Wagner was \\"the Silas G. Pratt of Germany\\".

In 1830, merchants from Alexandria (which at the time was within the jurisdiction of the federal District of Columbia) proposed linking their city to Georgetown to capitalize on the new Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C&O; Canal). Congress granted a charter to the Alexandria Canal Company in 1830. Construction began in 1833 and was completed in 1843. The Aqueduct Bridge (also begun in 1833 and completed in 1843) enabled canal boats from the C&O; Canal to cross the Potomac River without descending to the river level. The boats would then continue their trips downstream on a canal on the southwest side of the Potomac until they reached Alexandria's seaport. The canal ran southwards for seven miles through today's Arlington County and City of Alexandria, Virginia, dropping 38 feet through a series of four locks between Washington Street and the Potomac River in the northern portion of Alexandria. The Canal ended at a Tidal Basin (Pool No. 1) and a Tidal Lock (Lift Lock No. 1) located at the north end of Old Town Alexandria. The canal was abandoned in 1886. Ten years after the canal closed, an electric trolley line was constructed in 1896 in Arlington on the bed of the towpath that traveled near and along the canal's west side (see: Washington-Mount Vernon line of the Washington, Alexandria, and Mount Vernon Electric Railway).(1) 1900 map showing the route of the \\"Washington, Alexandria & Mt.

It is part of School District 39 Vancouver.  History  The school is located next to the intersection of Kingsway and Joyce Street and the original schoolhouse was central to the Collingwood community since its completion in 1896. It is ranked an \\"A\\" category heritage building in Vancouver's Heritage Register. Originally named the Vancouver East School, its name was changed to Collingwood Heights in 1908, and then to its present name in 1911. The school is named after Guy Carleton, the lieutenant-governor of Quebec during the late 18th century. = 2008 schoolhouse fire = At around midnight on March 2, 2008, the original schoolhouse was set ablaze by arsonists. The kindergarten classes that were taught in the schoolhouse had to be temporarily relocated due to the fire. After the fire, the Vancouver School Board (VSB) considered demolishing the charred building; however, the idea was met with heavy protest, and the idea was later scrapped. In 2012, Green Thumb Theatre entered into a lease agreement with the VSB, restoring the two outbuildings.

Its complex structure is developed on eight levels, with three main buildings separated by two partially covered inner alleys. Built completely in stone over the course of many centuries, the hamlet is composed of 160 rooms with vaulted ceilings (either barrel or cross vaults), linked with each other by an intricate and amazing labyrinth of stairways, terraces and alleys. The total length of the village is 50 metres along the north‚Äìsouth axis, and 30 metres along the east‚Äìwest axis. The total covered area is close to 3000 square metres. The stone used for the buildings is of local origin and was obtained from marine deposits present in the valley, or from the Bevera riverbed. The natural lime used in the mortar came from stones also found in the riverbed, where the sand was extracted. Torri Superiore has been called by some a labyrinth or a fortress, and offers a remarkable interest for its compactness and its state of preservation. Today it is mostly restored and open to ecologically minded visitors for cultural initiatives and group activities.  History The village of Torri is mentioned for the first time in a document dated in 1073 with the sentence: \\"Actum in castro ubi Ture dicitur\\" (Cais, \\"Contea di Ventimiglia\\"). The origin of the settlement of Torri Superiore is uncertain, and may date back to the late 13th century, a time of great social and religious unrest. This would explain its peculiar appearance, a stronghold that could offer protection to its few inhabitants, and is remarkable for its height (eight levels from the foundations to the roofs) and width. The latest parts of the hamlet were presumably built around the end of the 18th century, when the village reached its greatest population. Traces remain of communal living, a large hall used possibly as a common kitchen, an open air oven, and an intricate, closely knit pattern of rooms and terraces that create unexpected and charming effects.  The restoration: New life in the village  During the course of the last century, the village was gradually abandoned to decay, slowly turning into a ghost town with its beautiful towers almost completely deserted and in a state of ruin. In the early 90s, a new group of people approached Torri Superiore with the idea to restore it, create homes for a community of residents, and design a careful and well thought-out ‚Äúrecycling plan‚Äù, based on the respect for the original historical character of the buildings and for the surrounding environment. In the course of several years, a detailed study of the structure has led to the creation of a complex restoration programme that preserves and enhances the peculiarity of the medieval village. Small local firms, supported by volunteer efforts of all members and residents, did a large part of the building work. Since 1997, 14 residential units have been restored out of the 20 planned, and an ample part of the cultural centre, property of the Association, has been completed.

The test consists of nine index cards picturing different geometric designs. The cards are presented individually and test subjects are asked to copy the design before the next card is shown. Test results are scored based on the accuracy and organization of the reproductions. The Bender-Gestalt test was originally developed in 1938 by child psychiatrist Lauretta Bender. Additional versions were developed by other later practitioners, although adaptations designed as projective tests have been heavily criticized in the clinical literature due to their lack of psychometric validity. All versions follow the same general format but differ in how results are evaluated and scored. Background The first version of the Bender-Gestalt test was developed in 1938 by child neuropsychiatrist Lauretta Bender. The original test consists of nine index cards with different figures on each card. The subject is shown each figure and asked to copy it onto a piece of blank paper. The test typically takes 7‚Äì10 minutes, after which the results are scored based on accuracy and organization. It can be administered on both children and adults ages three and older. Bender first described her Visual-Motor Gestalt Test in a 1938 monograph titled A Visual Motor Gestalt Test and Its Clinical Use. The figures were derived from the work of the Gestalt psychologist Max Wertheimer. It ranked in the top five most popular psychological tests used by mental health practitioners, particularly school psychologists, from the 1960s until the early 1990s when participation in the required training began to decline. It measures perceptual motor skills, perceptual motor development, and gives an indication of neurological deficits. Additional versions were developed by later practitioners, although adaptations designed as projective tests have been heavily criticized in the clinical literature due to their lack of psychometric validity. All versions follow the same general format, but differ in how results are evaluated and scored. History The impetus for the clinical use of the Bender Gestalt came in the late 1930s when Max L. Hutt, an Instructor at the Educational Clinic of City College of New York became interested in developing a nonverbal projective personality test. The advantages of such an instrument would eliminate problems with language as well as prevent the test subjects from consciously screening their responses and the reproduction of the nine Bender Test Figures by test subjects could be accomplished in as little as ten minutes. Reasoning that providing a test subject with several sheets of blank paper, a pencil, and explaining that \\"you are going to be shown some cards, one at a time, with a simple design on each of them and you are to copy them as well as you can. Do it any way you think is best for you. This is not a test of artistic ability, but try to copy the designs as well as you can\\" would confront the subject with an ambiguous problem to solve. With no further instructions and the response of \\"do it in any way you think is best\\" to any questions, the subject was forced to interpret the task and proceed in a manner that was consistent with the individual's accustomed personality style. Hutt subsequently developed a series of \\"test factors\\" with suggestions as to the personality characteristics with which they might be associated. However, nothing regarding this preliminary work was published and it remained out of the mainstream of educational psychology, which at that time was virtually limited to intelligence, ability and vocational interest testing. However, with the United States entering into World War II in 1941, Hutt was commissioned in the U.S. Army and assigned as a consultant in Psychology to the Surgeon General's Office in Washington. The Army was experiencing a need to quickly train and deploy both Psychiatrists and Psychologists to meet the vastly increased need of professionals to diagnose and treat the emotional problems that develop in the stress of wartime military duty. Hutt's first assignment was to train Psychologists as clinicians and he established classes at Brooke Army Hospital in San Antonio, Texas. There he introduced the Bender-Gestalt Test to classes of inducted and commissioned psychologists who in prior years had experience in educational clinics, schools, and mental institutions. In 1945 he published and distributed a mimeographed \\"Tentative Guide for the Administration and Interpretation of the Bender-Gestalt Test\\" which had, in the previous three years, been widely adopted and utilized in the U.S. military. The clinicians trained by Hutt and now discharged and continuing the practice and teaching of Clinical Psychology in civilian life made the Bender-Gestalt one of the most widely utilized psychological tests. In 1959, Hutt met with a former student and recent Army Officer and Psychologist, Dr. Gerald J. Briskin, who had served during the Korean War and who had made considerable use of the Bender- Gestalt during his military service. Briskin had acquired extensive experience with that test in treating and diagnosing brain damage and stress-related psychological and psychiatric disorders. Their discussions and exchange of clinical findings led to the decision to bring their joint extensive experience with the Bender Gestalt in one definitive volume and that led to the publication of \\"The Clinical use of the Revised Bender-Gestalt Test, N.Y. Grune and Stratton, 1960. Subsequently, Elizabeth M. Koppitz adopted several of the Hutt and Briskin scoring factors in her subsequent work, The Bender- Gestalt Test for Young Children.Koppitz, Elizabeth M. (1964). The Bender- Gestalt Test for Young Children. New York: Grune and Stratton. ASIN B009NOJJ5G. The test has been used as a screening device for brain damage. Bender herself said it was \\"a method of evaluating maturation of gestalt functioning children 4-11's brain functioning by which it responds to a given constellation of stimuli as a whole, the response being a motor process of patterning the perceived gestalt.\\" Bender-II Originally published by the American Orthopsychiatric Association, it was purchased in the 1990s by Riverside Publishing company and released with a revised qualitative scoring system as the Bender-II under the direction of Dr. Gary Brannigan and Dr. Scott L. Decker. The Bender-II contains 16 figures versus 9 in the original. The new or revised scoring system for the Bender-II was developed based on empirical investigation of numerous scoring systems. The Global Scoring System was, tangentially related to Bender's original scoring method and a revision of a system devised by Branigan in the 1980s, was selected based on reliability and validity studies, as well as its ease of use and construct clarity. Elizabeth Koppitz, a clinical child psychologist and school psychologist (who worked most of her career in New York), developed a scoring system in the 1960s devoted to assessing the maturation of visual-motor skills in children, remaining true to Bender's aim for the test, and popularized its use in the schools. For decades, the Koppitz version, known as the Bender- Gestalt Test for Young Children, was one of the most frequently used scoring systems for the Bender-Gestalt in the United States. After Koppitz's death in the early 1980s, the use of the method held its popularity until the mid-1990s, when it was withdrawn from the market as a result of publishing company consolidations. Steve Mathews and Cecil Reynolds (a friend of Koppitz for some years near the end of her life) were eventually able to locate the publishing rights to the Koppitz version of the Bender-Gestalt, and these rights were subsequently acquired by Pro-Ed Publishing Company of Austin Texas, which then retained Cecil Reynolds to revise the Koppitz version. It was released under Reynolds' authorship in 2007 by Pro-Ed as the Koppitz-2: The Koppitz Developmental Scoring System for the Bender-Gestalt Test. A portion of the proceeds of all sales of the Koppitz-2 goes to the American Psychological Foundation to support the Koppitz scholarships in child clinical psychology. It is important to note that when the test-taker has a mental age less than 9, brain damage, a nonverbal learning disability, or an emotional problem, an error can occur in the results of the test.

Chot Reyes is a five-time PBA Coach of the Year. He is the President of TV5 Network, Inc. (from October 3, 2016 to June 2, 2019, replacing Noel Lorenzana) and president of Media5, which served as the sales and marketing arm of TV5. Formerly, he was the head of Sports5, TV5's Sports division until 2015 and Digital5 (now D5 Studio). On October 30, 2014, Reyes was removed as the head coach of the Philippine national team after the disbandment of the current roster, Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas head Manny V. Pangilinan said that there will be a new national team that will be formed by a pool by PBA commissioner Chito Salud. Professional coaching career Reyes was one of Earl Timothy Cone's assistant coaches during the early 90s with the Alaska Milkmen. Then only 27, Reyes took over the coaching for the Milkmen during the 1991 All-Filipino Conference as Cone was barred from coaching due to a case filed by the Basketball Coaches Association of the Philippines questioning Cone's hiring over other Filipinos. Reyes steered the Alaska franchise to third place finish in after beating San Miguel in a best- of-three series.Tim Cone was once banned from coaching in the PBA. Here's why In 1993, Reyes was hired head coach of the Coney Island Ice Cream Stars, now known as the Purefoods Tender Juicy Giants. In his first conference, he led the Ice Cream Stars that was bannered by Alvin Patrimonio and Jerry Codi√±era to a 4-2 series win over the San Miguel Beermen to win the All-Filipino Conference, creating history by being the youngest coach to win a championship in his first tournament at age 29. This feat led him to win his first Coach- of-the-Year award. In 1994, he again led the Purefoods to the Commissioner's Cup title over the Alaska Milkmen with Kenny Redfield as import. Reyes spent two more seasons with the Purefoods franchise before he was hired in 1997 by the Sta. Lucia Realtors. That year, he led the Realtors to a third-place finish in the All-Filipino and two respectable fourth-place finishes in the Commissioner's and Governor's Cup. However, he left the team in 1998 to join the newly formed Metropolitan Basketball Association. During his short time, he introduced some innovative yet criticized rules such as the Free-Three, the 23-second shot clock, and the eight second backcourt rule. Two years later, however, FIBA adopted the eight second backcourt rule which is in effect today, both for the international and pro game. After a while, he became the assistant coach of Tim Cone for the Philippine Centennial Team that went home with the bronze medal in the 1998 Asian Games. In 2000, Reyes became the new head coach of the Pop Cola Panthers, spending two seasons there. After a frustrating first season, he led the Panthers to a third-place finish in the 2001 All-Filipino Cup, with a rebuilt lineup of Rudy Hatfield, Johnny Abarrientos, and Poch Juinio. The Pop Cola franchise was then sold to food conglomerate San Miguel Corporation and was renamed as the Coca-Cola Tigers. The SMC management retained Reyes as coach and that year he led a Tigers team, depleted with the injuries of Abarrientos and Jeffrey Cariaso, to the 2002 PBA All-Filipino title - again creating history by being the first team in the PBA's history to win a title in its rookie year. Again, this feat led to Reyes' winning his second PBA Coach-of-the Year award. In 2003, he led Coke to three successive Finals appearances, winning the Reinforced Conference championship with Artemus McClary as import. This in turn led to his third Coach-of-the-Year award, thus becoming the only coach to win 3 COY awards thus far. Philippine national team Reyes giving instructions to Jimmy Alapag After the PBA and the Basketball Association of the Philippines agreed to a memorandum, the PBA hired Reyes as the coach of Team Pilipinas, a team composed of several professional and collegiate players. Reyes started the program in 2005, leading Team Pilipinas to a fifth-place finish in the FIBA- Asia Champions Cup, third-place in the William Jones Cup and the title in the 2005 Brunei Sultan Cup. Reyes confirmed that he is ready to be one of Toroman's coaching staff for Asian Games 2010 in China. However, the suspension of the national team by FIBA (which has since been lifted) had hindered the preparation of the team. In the 2006 William Jones Cup, Team Pilipinas finished a dismal sixth place in the tournament. It was due to the lack of player availabilities. Because of the uncertainty brought about by the FIBA suspension, many PBA players declined the invitation to participate. Instead, then-incoming pros LA Tenorio, Joseph Yeo, Abby Santos, Arwind Santos and several PBA players played in the Jones Cup squad. With the return of his core players to the national team, however, Reyes led Team Pilipinas to a 2-game sweep of Lebanon, which beat Venezuela and France in the 2006 World Championships in Japan. Reyes' team then went on the defend its title in the 2006 Brunei Sultan Cup via a rare 7-game sweep. After the Brunei Cup, Team Pilipinas was left for a while awaiting the lifting of the FIBA suspension that was handed down since 2005. However, with the approval of the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas as the new national sport association for basketball in the country, Reyes returned as the coach of the national squad. On October 30, 2014, Reyes was removed as the head coach of the Philippine national team after the disbandment of the current roster, Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas head Manny V. Pangilinan said that there will be a new national team that will be formed by a pool by PBA commissioner Chito Salud. On October 18, 2016, SBP executive director Sonny Barrios announced that Reyes will return as head coach of Gilas. Beyond coaching Prior to his participation as coach, Reyes worked for the Purefoods Corporation in a corporate setting before being hired by Cone as Alaska's assistant. In 2003, Reyes established coachcom.inc, an executive and coaching company that helps develop coaching aspects in sports and in other fields such as business. He also in 1998, Reyes appeared as a color commentator of the Metropolitan Basketball Association's coverage on Studio 23 it has been produced by ABS-CBN Sports during its maiden season of the league. He has also appeared as a color commentator for the PBA on ABC coverage. During his time as Purefoods head coach, he would appear in several coverages as a guest colleague, a time when Vintage practices inviting PBA coaches and assistants to do commentary. At some time in 2005 and 2006, Reyes appeared for ABC Sports as a pre-game, halftime, and post-game analyst during a game in two finals series.

It is the third book in the Ramona series, and follows Ramona Quimby and her classmates (some of them were in her kindergarten class for the previous year) going into first grade. Ramona the Brave was first published in 1975, seven years after Ramona the Pest. It was originally illustrated by Alan Tiegreen. Plot summary Ramona Quimby has spent most of the summer with her friend Howie Kemp, pounding old bricks into dust in a game called Brick Factory. Brick Factory makes Ramona feel powerful, something that doesn't happen very often since she is the youngest in her family. Longing to be brave and grown-up, Ramona sticks up for her older sister, Beatrice \\"Beezus\\" Quimby, when some boys tease about her nickname (calling her \\"Beezus Jesus\\" or \\"Jesus Beezus\\") by claiming they will go to hell for mocking Jesus. However, Ramona is crushed to realize that instead of considering her a hero, Beezus is embarrassed, and becomes angrier at Ramona for defending her than she is at the boys for teasing her. By the end of summer, Mother gets a part-time job and some workmen cut a hole in their house to add an extra bedroom (especially since Beezus and Ramona would bicker often when they shared a room). Beezus and Ramona are going to take turns using the new room (for half a year), and Ramona gets to be first, though she finds it frightening to go to sleep in the new room alone. When first grade starts, Ramona begins learning to read. However, she is convinced that her teacher, Mrs. Griggs, dislikes her. This feeling is worsened by Ramona's tendency to get into trouble. One day when her class is making paper-bag owls for Parents' Night, Ramona sees Susan, her kindergarten nemesis, copying Ramona's owl. Mrs. Griggs sees Susan's owl first and shows it off to the class. Ramona is outraged at Susan for copying as now Ramona's owl isn't special, and destroys both owls. The next day, Ramona is forced to apologize to Susan in front of the whole class, but things improve when the class is nice to her afterward. One day on her way to school a big dog comes after Ramona, so she takes off her shoe and throws it at him. The dog picks up her shoe and carries it away, forcing Ramona to limp her way back to school. That turns out to be the morning Mrs. Griggs finally chooses Ramona to lead the morning flag salute, and Mrs. Griggs discovers that Ramona is only wearing one shoe. Ramona uses her ingenuity to deal with the situation, and when her shoe is returned, the school secretary compliments her bravery, resulting in her nickname \\"the Brave\\". Reception Kirkus Reviews praised the novel, stating that the writing was \\"amusing, sound, empathic. . . as always.\\" As of 2014, 97 editions of Ramona the Brave had been published in 6 languages.

They were built to a variety of designs, many under licence from Germany. They served throughout the war against Italian, French and British shipping in the Mediterranean Sea with some success, losing eight of the twenty eight boats in service in return. They were reinforced by the Imperial German Navy‚Äôs Pola Flotilla, mainly comprising coastal U-boats transported by rail from Germany's northern shipyards to the Austrian ports on the Adriatic Sea. Following the end of the war in 1918, all Austrian submarines were surrendered to the Entente powers, who disposed of them individually. As both Austria and Hungary became landlocked in the aftermath of the war, no Austrian or Hungarian submarines (or any other naval vessels) have been commissioned since. In some sources Austro-Hungarian U-boats are referenced with Roman numerals as a way to distinguish them from German U-boats with similar numbers, but the Austro-Hungarian Navy itself used Arabic numerals. There are gaps in the numbering for several reasons. One series of Austro-Hungarian U-boats under construction in Germany was sold and commissioned into the Imperial German Navy. In other cases, U-boats commissioned into the Imperial German Navy were temporarily assigned Austro-Hungarian numbers when they operated in the Mediterranean. One final reason, in the case of the unassigned U-13, was superstition. This is a list of all U-boats commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy. (Submarines on which construction was begun but which were not completed or commissioned during World War I are not included.) U-1 class The U-1 class consisted of two submarines or U-boats named U-1 and U-2, which were built for and operated by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The U-1-class boats were built to an American design at the navy yard in Pola.Gardiner, p. 342. The class was a part of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's efforts to competitively evaluate three foreign submarine designs.Gardiner, p. 340. The two U-1-class boats, both launched in 1909, were long and as built were each powered by two gasoline engines while surfaced, and two electric motors when submerged. Neither boat was operational at the beginning of World War I because both were in drydock awaiting replacement diesel engines for their problematic gasoline engines.Gardiner, p. 341. Beginning in 1915, both boats conducted reconnaissance cruises out of either Trieste or Pola until declared obsolete in early 1918. Both remained in service as a training boats at the submarine base on Brioni, but each was at Pola at the end of the war.Gibson and Prendergast, p. 388. They were ceded to Italy as war reparations in 1920 and scrapped at Pola. Neither submarine sank any ships during the war. U-3 class The U-3 class consisted of two U-boats, U-3 and U-4, and was also a part of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's efforts to competitively evaluate three foreign submarine designs. The U-3-class boats were designed and built by Germaniawerft of Kiel, Germany.Gardiner, p. 340. During the evaluations conducted by the Navy, the U-3 design bested the U-1 (Lake) and U-5 (Holland) classes in reliability and provided the best living conditions. They did, however, have the worst diving abilities of the three designs, and produced excessive exhaust smoke.The results of the evaluation led the Austro-Hungarian Navy to order five new U-boats from Germaniawerft as the . The two U-3-class boats, both launched in 1908, were just under long and were each powered by two kerosene two-stroke engines while surfaced, and two electric motors when submerged.Sieche, p. 17 The U-3 class initially had diving problems that were alleviated after several modifications to fins and diving planes. Both boats of the class served in combat during World War I. , the lead boat of the class, was sunk by gunfire in August 1915. was the longest-serving Austro-Hungarian submarine and sank over of ships, including the Italian armored cruiser Giuseppe Garibaldi in July 1915. U-4 was handed over to France as a war reparation in 1920 and scrapped.  U-5 class  The U-5 class consisted of three U-boats, U-5, U-6, and U-12, and was also a part of the efforts of Austro-Hungarian navy to competitively evaluate three foreign submarine designs. The design of the boats was based upon John Philip Holland's submarine design and the boats featured a single, teardrop-shaped hull, which resembled the design of modern nuclear submarines.Sieche, p. 21. The class members were just over long and displaced surfaced and submerged.Gardiner, p. 343. All were originally equipped with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry four torpedoes. The first two boats, U-5 and U-6, built specifically for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, were partially constructed in the United States and completed at Whitehead & Co. at Fiume. The third was completely constructed by Whitehead's at Fiume and purchased by Austria- Hungary to bolster their U-boat fleet after the outbreak of World War I. All three boats had successes during World War I, between them, sinking five ships with a combined gross register tonnage (GRT) of 22,391. In addition they captured seven ships as prizes and damaged a French dreadnought of . All three boats were sunk during the war, though U-5, the lead boat of the class, was raised and recommissioned after her sinking. After the war's end, U-5, the only surviving example of the class, was ceded to Italy as a war reparation and was broken up in 1920.Sieche, p. 22  U-10 class  The U-10 class was a class of five U-boats ‚ÄîU-10, U-11, U-15, U-16, and U-17‚Äî of the Austro- Hungarian Navy during World War I. The class was similar to the German Type UB I submarine of the German Imperial Navy (). The boats were small coastal submarines that displaced surfaced and submerged. The first two boats delivered to Austria-Hungary had previously been commissioned in February 1915 by the Kaiserliche Marine, while the remaining three were commissioned by the Austro-Hungarian marine in April 1915. The U-10 class as a whole did not have much wartime success, with three of the boats sinking either one or no ships. Only one boat, sank more than of enemy ships. Of the five submarines of the class, only was sunk during the war; the remaining four were delivered as war reparations and broken up by 1920.  U-14 class  SM U-14 or U-XIV was a U-boat of the Austro-Hungarian Navy during World War I. She was launched in 1912 as the French Curie (Q 87), but captured and rebuilt for service in the Austro-Hungarian Navy. At war's end, the submarine was returned to France and restored to her former name. Curie was launched in July 1912 at Toulon and completed in 1914. She measured just under long and displaced nearly on the surface and just over when submerged. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Curie was assigned to duty in the Mediterranean. In mid-December, Curies commander conceived a plan to infiltrate the Austro-Hungarian Navy's main base at Pola, but during the 20 December attempt, the vessel became ensnared in harbor defenses. Two Austro-Hungarian ships sank Curie, killing three of her crew; the remainder were taken prisoner. The Austro-Hungarian Navy, which had a small and largely obsolete U-boat fleet, immediately began salvage efforts and succeeded in raising the lightly damaged submarine in early February 1915. After a refit, the boat was commissioned as SM U-14 in June, but had little success early in her career. When her commander fell ill in October, he was replaced by Georg Ludwig von Trapp. U-14 was damaged by a depth charge attack in February 1916, and underwent an extensive modernization through November. Resuming duty under von Trapp, U-14 sank her first ship in April 1917, but had her most successful patrol in August, when she sank five ships‚Äîincluding , reportedly the largest cargo ship in the world‚Äîin a six-day span. In January 1918, von Trapp was replaced as commander, but neither of his two successors were able to match his accomplishments. In all, U-14 sank 11 ships with a combined gross register tonnage of nearly 48,000 tons. Returned to France at the end of the war, she rejoined the French Navy in July 1919 under her former name of Curie. She was stricken in 1928 and scrapped in 1929.  U-20 class  The U-20 class was a class of four U-boats, U-20, U-21, U-22, and U-23. The class is sometimes referred to as the Havmanden class because it was based upon the design of the Royal Danish Navy's 1911 Havmanden class submarines, three of which were built in Fiume. Even though the Havmanden-class design was largely obsolete by the beginning of the war, four boats were ordered by the Austro-Hungarian Navy in 1915, in part because construction could begin immediately. Political considerations caused the order to be split between Austrian and Hungarian firms, which contributed to construction problems and delays, keeping any of the boats from being operational until mid-1917. The class boats were just over long and were armed with two front torpedo tubes, a deck gun, and a machine gun. The engines for the boats were unreliable, which compounded handling problems with the design. The U-20 class did not claim any wartime successes, yet lost two of the boats‚ÄîU-20 and U-23‚Äîto enemy action during the war. The remaining two were delivered as war reparations and broken up. The conning tower from U-20, which was raised and salvaged in 1962, is on display in a military museum in Vienna.  U-27 class  The U-27 class was a class of eight U-boats ‚ÄîU-27, U-28, U-29, U-30, U-31, U-32, U-40, and U-41‚Äîbased upon the German Type UB II design of the German Imperial Navy and was constructed under license in Austria-Hungary. After the Austro-Hungarian Navy had filled its most urgent needs for submarines after the outbreak of World War I, they selected the German Type UB II design for its next group of submarines in mid-1915. Orders for the first six boats were placed in October 1915 with the Austrian firm of Cantiere Navale Triestino and the Hungarian firm of Ganz Danubius. Two more boats were ordered in 1916, bringing the class total to eight. The boats were just over long and were armed with two bow torpedo tubes, a deck gun, and a machine gun. For propulsion they were equipped with twin diesel engines for surface running and twin electric motors for subsurface movement. Although the class was based on the German design, the Austro-Hungarian U-boats were heavier and slightly faster underwater, but less heavily armed than their German counterparts All eight boats were commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy between 1917 and 1918 and saw active service during the war. and were the most successful in terms of ships sunk and gross register tonnage sunk, respectively. Two boats sank only one ship each, and a third, , sank no ships. U-30 was also the only boat of the class to be lost during the war. The remaining seven were ceded to France and Italy as war reparations and six were scrapped by 1920; the seventh sank while being towed to Bizerta for scrapping.  U-43 class  The U-43 class was a class of two coastal U-boats which were Type UB II submarines ‚ÄîU-43, and U-47‚Äîof the Imperial German Navy, making the two classes identical. From the beginning of World War I, Austria-Hungary had been working to increase the size of its U-boat fleet, so the Imperial German Navy, which was finding it difficult to obtain trained submarine crews, sold two of its UB II boats, and , to its ally in June 1917. The German Type UB II design incorporated improvements over Type UB I boats, the first coastal submarines of the German Imperial Navy. Among these were twin engines and shafts for more redundancy during operations, a higher top speed, and larger torpedo tubes with double the complement of torpedoes. As a result the UB II boats were nearly twice as heavy as their predecessor UB I boats. Both boats of the class were selected for German service in the Mediterranean while under construction. They were shipped via rail to Pola, assembled, launched, and commissioned in the German Imperial Navy, where both enjoyed great success against Allied shipping. In June 1917, the boats were decommissioned, handed over to Austria-Hungary, and then commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in July. The B in the designation of both boats was dropped, but the submarines retained the same numbers, becoming U-43 and U-47 under the Austro-Hungarian flag. At the end of the war and were ceded to Italy and France, respectively, and had been scrapped by 1920. Other classes Several other classes were designed, but none of these ended up being operated by the Austro-Hungarian navy. The U-7-class was a class of five U-boats built by Germaniawerft of Kiel to their 506d design for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The five boats were sold to the Imperial Germany Navy at the beginning of World War I when it was thought impossible for the submarines to reach the Mediterranean for delivery to Austria-Hungary. The U-boats were operated by the German Imperial Navy () during World War I. and were alternately referred to as the U-66-class or the Type UD. The Austro-Hungarian Navy, after competitively evaluating six submarines of three foreign designs, had selected the Germaniwerft 506d design over a design from Whitehead & Co. for the U-7 class. The boats, numbered U-7 to U-11, were designed to be long and displace between when surfaced and submerged. They were to be armed with five torpedo tubes and a deck gun. For propulsion the design called for twin diesel engines for surface running and twin electric motors for subsurface movement. The Austro-Hungarian Navy ordered the boats in February 1913 and construction began on the first boats in November. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Austro- Hungarian Navy became convinced that delivery of the still-unfinished submarines to the Mediterranean via Gibraltar would be impossible. As a result, they sold the five boats to the Imperial German Navy in November 1914. The German Navy assigned the numbers U-66 to U-70 to the five submarines and had them redesigned and reconstructed to their specifications. These changes, which included a larger deck gun, increased the displacement of the U-boats by almost surfaced and nearly submerged. The U-48 class was a class of four U-boats planned for the Austro-Hungarian Navy ( or ) during World War I. The design of the boats was based on plans purchased from the German firm of AG Weser in January 1916. The Navy authorized Cantiere Navale Triestino to begin construction of the submarines in Pola in September 1916. Only two of the planned four boats were laid down, but both of them were never launched or completed. Both incomplete submarines were scrapped after the war ended. The U-50 class was a class of four ocean-going U-boats planned for the Austro- Hungarian Navy ( or ) during World War I. The design of the boats was based on the Project 835 design purchased from the German firm of Germaniawerft in July 1915. The Navy authorized Ganz-Danubius to begin construction of the submarines in Fiume in February 1916. Only two of the planned four boats were laid down, but neither were ever launched or completed. The two incomplete submarines were scrapped after the war ended. The U-52 class was a class of four ocean-going U-boats planned for the Austro-Hungarian Navy ( or ) during World War I. The submarine design was based on the A 6 proposal submitted by Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) as part of a Navy design competition. STT, under its wartime name of Austriawerft, began construction on the first two boats in 1916, but neither boat was launched or completed before the end of the war. Both incomplete submarines were scrapped after the war ended. Neither of the third and fourth submarines was ever laid down. The U-101 class was a class of nine U-boats planned for the Austro-Hungarian Navy ( or ) during World War I. The class was based on the Type 1916 S 1 design from Ungarische Unterseebotsbau AG. The first three boats were laid down in late 1917 and early 1918 by Austriawerft in Trieste, but none were launched or completed before the end of the war. None of the other six submarines was ever laid down. The U-107 class was a class of U-boats planned for the Austro- Hungarian Navy ( or ) during World War I. The design was similar to the Germaniawerft UD design which had formed the basis for the Austro-Hungarian Navy's s. Two boats (U-107 and U-108) were laid down in early 1918 by Ganz- Danubius in Fiume, but neither was launched or completed before the end of the war. No other submarines of the class were ever laid down.

He generally plays fullback or wing. He played in 69 tests for the Springboks. Youth and early career Pietersen was educated at the Ho√´rskool Generaal Hertzog in Witbank, but made his provincial debut with the as a 19-year-old during the 2005 Currie Cup season. His 2006 Super 14 season was disrupted by injuries but despite this, he was included in the South African under-21 team to compete at the 2006 Under 21 Rugby World Championship. South Africa made the final, but were defeated by the hosts, France. International career Upon arriving back to South Africa after the under-21 World Championship he was named in the Springboks' 2006 Tri Nations Series squad where he debuted against New Zealand at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg. Pietersen's deceptive pace and gliding runs make him an unpredictable back-line player, with the ability to break the line at will and create attacking opportunities for his team. He is also a clinical finisher, and was the leading try scorer in the 2007 Super 14 competition with 12 tries from 15 games. Pietersen remains a firm fan favourite for the unpredictable and exciting dimension his play brings to the team. Before the emergence of Francois Steyn at the Sharks franchise, Pietersen was seen as the ideal replacement for Percy Montgomery as fullback, however with Steyn being able to play at fullback, wing or fly-half, Pietersen focused on wing as his primary position, and it is in this role that most of his appearances have been made for club and country. He was selected into the Springboks 2007 Rugby World Cup squad. Starting in the first two matches, Pietersen scored three tries. He was impressive in the game against England, scoring two tries and setting up a third. The top try-scorer in the 2007 Super 14 failed to score even one in 2008, a fact acknowledged by both AJ Venter and Stefan Terblanche in the October 2008 edition of SA Sports Illustrated. However, post World Cup Pietersen went on to establish the most capped wing combination in Springbok history with Bryan Habana, standing currently at 25 tests, ten more than next best, James Small and Jaques Olivier. Aside from his obvious attacking abilities, Pietersen is widely regarded for his outstanding defence. His cover defence being the saving grace of the Springbok's 2008 End of Year Tour, manfully keeping the Welsh at bay, and dominating his opposite Shane Williams. His all-round skills remain of the highest standard, maturing into one of the best wings since South Africa's readmission to international sport. Pietersen was called up for South Africa's 2011 Rugby World Cup campaign starting the first game in a 17‚Äì16 victory for the Springboks against Wales. South Africa then thrashed Fiji 49‚Äì3 with Pietersen this time playing on the left wing. Pietersen did not play when South Africa thrashed Namibia 87‚Äì0. He started again on the right wing as South Africa squeezed past Samoa 13‚Äì5. South Africa were then through to the quarter-finals of the world cup. South Africa were then knocked out of the tournament losing 11‚Äì9 against Australia. He has also scored 4 tries in the 2015 world cup. In April 2013, it was announced that he would play for Panasonic Wild Knights in the 2013‚Äì14 Top League in Japan, meaning he missed out on the ' 2013 Currie Cup Premier Division campaign, but would return to the for the 2014 Super Rugby season. Pietersen signed a three-year deal to join English Premiership side Leicester Tigers prior to the 2016‚Äì2017 season. However, as of 20 June 2017, Pieterson was granted early release from Welford Road to join top French club Toulon in the Top 14 from the 2017-18 season.

It is the largest university in the state of Bahia and one of Brazil's most prestigious educational institutions. Students can study there without paying tuition fees, as it is a public university. To join the university they must pass an annual examination, known as the \\"ENEM\\" (National High School Exam). History UFBA was created on April 8, 1946, through Decree-Law 9155. Earlier, the Federal University of Bahia was formed by the School of Medicine and their associated schools, Dentistry and Pharmacy, and the schools of Philosophy, Economics, Law beyond the Polytechnic School. The actual installation of the university took place on July 2, 1946, the oldest center of higher education in the country, the School of Medicine at the Shrine of Jesus. Four years later, the Federal University of Bahia was federalized. On December 4, 1950, the government enacted the 2234 law setting the Federal System of Higher Education. Since then, the university has been called the Federal University of Bahia. The history of higher education in the state dates back to 1808 when, for determination of the Portuguese court, the first school of medical education in the country was established: the Medical School of Bahia. This was followed by the Faculty of Pharmacy (1832), School of Fine Arts (1877), School of Law (1891), Polytechnique School (1897), School of Economics (1905), School of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters (1943), School of Librarianship (1942) that formed part of others since 1946.About UFBA From that date onwards, new courses were created to meet the scientific and cultural needs of society. The work was coordinated by Edgard Santos, dean of the university from 1946 to 1961. During this period of activity, the following installations were added: the Central Teaching Hospital, the Schools of Architecture and Education, the School of Music and Scenic art, the School of Geology, the Institutes of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Health Sciences, the Center for Afro-Oriental Studies and the Museum of Sacred art.Historical Information - UFBA Student life The university has 57 undergraduate courses, 82 post-graduate courses and more than 100 postgraduate courses.

He rose to prominence in the mid-1990s for his Miss Attitude retail chain. He has held many public appointments and was invited by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair to serve on a government advisory panel on small businesses and on the Competitiveness Council. He served on the seven-man government task force which was asked to review and then report on the Department of Culture, Media, and Sport.http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/peerreview.pdf He was appointed to the DTIs Competitiveness Council and the Small Business Council by the government and is known as the \\"British Bill Gates\\". He is also an advocate for the National Living Wage.  Education  Singh studied English, Business Studies, Politics and General Studies A-levels after doing his GCSEs. In 2004, he received an honorary doctorate from Guru Nanak Dev University for his contribution to entrepreneurship. Career Reuben Singh was born into a wealthy family who ran a large importing business, Sabco, and had business interests in Canada. They came to England in the 1970s and had a family home in Poynton, a village in Cheshire. His first business, Miss Attitude, was a retail chain which sold girls' accessories and opened in 1995 in the Manchester Arndale Centre. Within a few years, there were more than 100 Miss Attitude shops across the UK. He sold the business in 1999 for an undisclosed price while at university. Reports in the British press initially suggested a sum that ranged wildly between ¬£1 and ¬£22m. Due to the deal being subject to a confidentiality agreement, the actual sum remains unknown. = alldayPA = Singh launched alldayPA, a contact centre company, in 2000. The company's financial statements recorded increased profits year on year (between 2004‚Äì2011) and Singh began to build up partnerships with multinational companies such as T-Mobile and MBNA credit card. The company was estimated to be valued at around the ¬£85 million mark. Singh remained on the management team of the company until he was declared bankrupt in October 2007 on the petition of Bank of Scotland, in a dispute over a loan he had personally guaranteed (a case that lasted from 2004 till 2007). He was automatically discharged from bankruptcy after one year, as is standard procedure in the UK, in October 2008. Singh has since overseen a ¬£15m investment in new technology at the company, and in 2017 saw the largest number of calls answered for its clients in a 12-month period - over 20 million. In 2015 alldayPA moved into a 300-seat call centre in Salford Quays, promising the creation of a further 200 jobs. Singh further expanded the digital footprint of alldayPA in 2016 and launched an app, investing ¬£250,000. It allows tracking of incoming calls, monitoring of usage cost data and receiving notifications of inbound messages easily. The company currently has over 24,000 clients is regarded as a specialist in call answering and business support and a key investor in Salford. = Isher Capital = Singh is CEO of Isher Capital, a 'boutique' private equity firm launched in 2014 and based in London and Manchester. In 2018, Isher Capital announced a ¬£20m investment into acquiring smaller contact centers across the UK to push Isher Capital¬ís current contact center portfolio which is to create and secure 1,500 jobs. Philanthropy His charitable work has included supporting the Prince's Trust working with young entrepreneurs and supporting interfaith partnerships in the UK. In 2015, he launched the Reuben Singh Scholarship to support young people in higher education to work on their business ideas while studying. It was made open to any UK undergraduate who showed business endeavors or entrepreneurial spirit. Honors and awards On 26 January 2003 The World Economic Forum honoured him as one of the \\"Global Leaders of Tomorrow\\" (GLT) in Davos. On 13 October 2003 his portrait was included in the UK National Portrait Gallery in a photograph taken by Trevor Ray Hart in December 1999. In 2003 the MIT Boston Technology Review Magazine voted him one of the World's top Innovators in their prestigious review. In May 2005 he was invited to Dubai by His Royal Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum the Dubai Crown Prince to address an audience of over 1000 business leaders and entrepreneurs. He was entered into the 1998 Guinness Book of Records as the world's youngest self-made millionaire and also featured at joint 7th in the 2002 Sunday Times 'Rich List'.  Financial disagreements  In 2002, an article in the Manchester Evening News ‚Äì followed a few days later by an article in the Financial Mail ‚Äì called him little more than a fantasist and that his wealth and business success was considerably less than he claimed. It also revealed that the buyer of Miss Attitude, American financier Gary Klesch, claimed to have bought the debt-laden business for ¬£1. However, independent articles noted that it may have been a \\"deliberate character-assassination attempt.\\" Singh himself told Sathnam Sanghera of the Financial Times that, \\"these stories are just rumours based on jealousy and are a total misrepresentation\\", adding that a confidentiality clause prohibited him from discussing the matter.Sathnam Sanghera interviews Reuben Singh He then, suffered somewhat of a backlash from the media. The Manchester Evening News, which had previously printed positive stories about Singh, began to run negative pieces and sought to expose any discrepancies in his affairs. The paper alleged that he had used the press to his advantage, using inaccurate reports about his business prowess to further inflate his reputation as a successful entrepreneur. MP Graham Stringer called for tighter regulations after Singh was able to gain a position on a Government advisory panel without any prior checks. Another company set up by Singh, a health food company called Robson & Steinberg, folded after less than a year of trading, with debts of ¬£250,000.Cosmetic success: The fallen business star ‚Äì Home News, UK ‚Äì Independent.co.uk Questions were raised about what Singh called the 'Reuben Singh Group of Companies.' According to Singh, these were 12 trading entities dealing in currency trading, property, retail and construction. However a search in the Britain, Companies House listed only two British companies with any net assets of ¬£1000 and ¬£100. The other five British companies that Singh was listed as the director had never filed any accounts but the concern was raised on a ¬£2.64m payment that Singh paid overseas from one of the companies. Further problems arose in relation to a multimillion-pound overdraft which Singh had guaranteed. In 2004 he was sued by the Royal Bank of Scotland, with judge Michael Kershaw QC ordering Singh to pay the bank ¬£1,229,966 for an overdraft and their legal costs. The judge commented, \\"(The banker) was, I think, to some extent a victim of Mr Singh's personality as well as Mr Singh's lies.\\" References British businesspeople People from Poynton 1976 births Living people ","title":"Reuben Singh"},{"id":"5756465","text":"A growing region is an area suited by climate and soil conditions to the cultivation of a certain type of crop or plant group.

Growing regions, because of the need for climate consistency, are usually oriented along a general latitude, and in the United States these are often called \\"belts\\".

The siege lasted from 26 January to 19 February 1598. Background Yang Hao, Ma Gui, and Gwon Yul met up at Gyeongju on the 26 January 1598 and marched on Ulsan with an army of 50,000. Battle The allied army reached Ulsan on 29 January. The battle began with a false retreat that lured the Japanese garrison into a frontal attack. They were defeated with 500 losses and were forced to retreat to Tosan fortress. The allies occupied the city of Ulsan. On 30 January the allies bombarded the fortress and then took the outer wall of Tosan. The Japanese abandoned much of their food supplies and retreated into the inner fortress. The allies assaulted the inner fortress, at one point even taking a portion of the wall, but suffered heavy casualties. Their cannons were of no help since the fortress was situated too high to reach. Eventually the attack was called off and a long siege began. On 19 February the allied forces attacked again and were repelled. Seeing Japanese reinforcements arrive, Yang Hao decided to lift the siege and retreat, but the disorganized movement led to many stragglers being cut down by the Japanese, leading to heavy casualties. Aftermath According to one source, of the original 10,000 garrisoned at Ulsan, less than 1,000 survived the siege. However other sources put the original garrison force at 20,000 and 23,000. Yang Hao would ultimately be called back to Beijing for his failure at Ulsan on 12 August 1598.

However, Dury had been contributing to Viz since as early as 1985, often delivering his cartoons by hand to Donald's house. Early creations, Donald noted, tended to have names that rhymed such as Tristam Banks and his Jocular Pranks or Albert Gordon the Traffic Warden.

Its definition and power were provided by Parliament in the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. Control orders were also included in the Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005. The control orders section of the Prevention of Terrorism Act provides for extremely limited rights of appeal and the absence of double jeopardy restrictions (i.e. if a recipient managed to win an appeal in the Court of Appeal or other tribunal, the Home Office could simply re-apply the same order again). This has led to many court rulings highly critical of the orders.Judges reject government appeal over control orders The Prevention of Terrorism Act and control orders were repealed in December 2011 by the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act 2011.  Powers  The list of possible restrictions and obligations that can be included in a control order is long. It can place restrictions on what the person can use or possess, their place of work, place of residence, whom they speak to, and where they can travel. Furthermore, the person can be ordered to surrender their passport, let the police visit their home at any time, report to officials at a specific time and place, and allow themselves to be electronically tagged so their movements can be tracked. In short, it provides for a graduated scale of technological \\"prisons without bars\\" that are intended to work within the European Convention on Human Rights. When the control order crosses the line and \\"deprives liberty\\", rather than \\"restricts liberty\\", it is called a derogating control order because it infringes Article 5 of the ECHR. This can only happen if there is a derogation according to Article 15, and the Home Secretary must apply to a court for the authority. Derogation is only allowed when there is a \\"war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation\\". The ECHR states that the government cannot deprive any person of their liberty without due process of law. This process must include informing the person of the accusation against him, giving him access to legal assistance to prepare his defence, and giving him the right to have his case heard and decided in public before a competent court. The government has claimed that the terrorist allegations against certain individuals are of such a nature and from such sources that they cannot be prosecuted \\"because that would mean revealing sensitive and dangerous intelligence\\". =List of restrictions= *Possession and/or use of specified objects and substances. *Use of specified services and/or facilities. *Certain occupations and employment. *Carrying out specified activities. *Restriction on association and communications with specified people, or people in general. *Restriction of place of residence, and visitors to the residence. *Movements at certain times of the day, or to certain places. *Passport must be surrendered. *A requirement to admit specified persons to certain premises. *A requirement to allow specified persons to confiscate and/or scientifically examine any object on premises owned by the subject. *A requirement to allow electronic surveillance to be carried out and photographs taken. *Any other restrictions whatsoever for up to 24hrs, when it is deemed necessary.  History  The power to make control orders was voted through Parliament on the evening of 11 March 2005 after a famously long session of Parliamentary ping-pong. The ten detainees being held under Part 4 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 were released from Belmarsh and were immediately subject to control orders. On March 24, 2005, one of the men, Abu Rideh, gave a newspaper interview where he denied having any connection with terrorism, and was able to outline the contents of his order. * He is not allowed to make arrangements to meet anybody, but he can meet them if he does so unannounced * He cannot attend any prearranged meetings or gatherings, but was present at the anti-war demonstration at Hyde Park the previous Saturday. He says he stumbled across it while playing football in the park with his children * He is banned from having visitors to his home unless they are vetted in advance, but he is allowed to arrange to attend group prayers at a mosque On April 16, 2005, it was reported that all 10 control orders had been printed with the same reason, connecting individuals with the Wood Green \\"ricin plot\\". It was blamed on a \\"clerical error\\". On 23 May 2011, following a Government Review of Counter-Terrorism and Security Measures published in January 2011,http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/counter- terrorism/review-of-ct-security-powers/review-findings-and-rec?view=Binary the Home Office announced the scheme intended to replace the control orders: Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIM).http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/about-us/legislation/tpim- bill/ Although intended to be more flexible and to focus more on the investigation of the individual suspected of terrorism-related activity with increased judicial oversight, they have been dubbed as mere re-brandings of control orders. Timeline of ministerial statements and legal challenges Section 14 requires the Home Secretary to make a statement to Parliament every three months reporting about their exercise of the control order powers. * 11 March 2005 - The act came into force and 11 orders were in place, all against former Belmarsh prisoners who had been held under the previous Anti-terrorism regime. * 16 June 2005 - Nothing had changed, except that 3 of the orders were varied to take account of change of address. * 10 October 2005 - 9 orders had been revoked, one new one in made against a British national.

I do not consider that this is a borderline case.\\" * 11 September 2006 - 9 new orders were made; 2 were against British citizens on 19 June and 5 September, the rest against foreign nationals, one on 31 July and the other 6 on 1 August. There were now 15 orders in force, 6 of which are against British citizens. * 16 October 2006 - the Home Office revealed that two men who are subject to control orders had absconded and were on the run.

The plot concerns three gold miners and their dog, and the farcical consequences of leaving a bomb cartridge unattended. The story was first published in the collection Joe Wilson and His Mates in 1901.The Penguin Henry Lawson Short Stories (first published 1986); with an introduction by John Barnes, Camberwell, Victoria: Penguin Books Australia, pp. 13, 224-5 Plot summary Three gold miners named Dave Regan, Jim Bently, and Andy Page are sinking a shaft at Stony Creek. The trio own a young retriever dog named Tommy, described as \\"an overgrown pup... a big foolish, four-footed mate.\\" Andy and Dave, fishing enthusiasts, devise a unique method of catching fish using explosives. The dog picks up an explosive cartridge in its mouth, and runs the fuse through the campfire, prompting the three men to flee. Tommy, thinking it a game, playfully chases down his \\"two-legged mates,\\" who try everything in their power to escape the cartridge. Jim tries to climb a tree and then drops down a mine shaft, meanwhile Andy has hidden behind a log. When Dave seeks refuge in the local pub, the dog bounds in after him, causing the Bushmen inside to scatter. Tommy comes across a \\"vicious yellow mongrel cattle-dog sulking and nursing his nastiness under [the kitchen],\\" who takes the cartridge for himself. A crowd of dogs, curious about this unusual object, gather around the cartridge. The subsequent explosion blows apart the yellow cattle-dog and maims numerous others. For half an hour, the Bushmen who witnessed the spectacle are laughing hysterically. Tommy the retriever trots home after Dave, \\"smiling his broadest, longest, and reddest smile of amiability, and apparently satisfied for one afternoon with the fun he‚Äôd had.\\". Characters *Tommy the retriever: A black, overgrown pup \\"who was always slobbering... Most of his head was usually a red, idiotic, slobbering grin of appreciation of his own silliness. He seemed to take life, the world, his two-legged mates, and his own instinct as a huge joke.\\" *Dave Regan: A laid-back gold miner, who is fond of fishing. It is Dave's idea to use a cartridge to catch fish. *Andy Page: A fellow gold miner, who \\"usually put Dave‚Äôs theories into practice if they were practicable, or bore the blame for the failure and the chaffing of his mates if they weren‚Äôt.\\" *Jim Bently: Described as being uninterested in the \\"damned silliness\\" of Dave and Andy's scheme. He enjoys eating fish, but has no interest in fishing.

John Barnes cites the story as being illustrative of Lawson's talent for humorous writing, calling it a \\"hilarious farce.\\" Barnes further remarks that, despite focusing on the actions of the dog, \\"Lawson raises the story above the level of stock farce by making what happens the result of Dave Regan's bright idea.\\" See also * Dog Barbos and Unusual Cross References 1899 short stories Short stories by Henry Lawson ","title":"The Loaded Dog"},{"id":"5756505","text":"Battle Squadron is a vertically scrolling shooter for the Amiga and ported a year later to the Sega Mega Drive console, for one or two players.

The game was later ported to iOS devices (2011), Android (2012) and in 2013 also to AmigaOS 4, Windows, OS X and MorphOS. 4 screenshots of Battle Squadron Story Taking place many years in the future in another star system, a century long war is waging between the Earth Defense Fleet and the Barrax Empire. Two Earth Defense Commanders, Lori Bergin and Barry Mayers, were returning from a research and destroy mission regarding the latest Barrax technologies on planet Urania, when suddenly a Barrax cruiser materialized behind them, brought their ship in and took the commanders hostage on planet Terrainia. The player's mission is to rescue the Commanders and eliminate all Barrax threats in the process. Gameplay Battle Squadron supports both mouse- and joystick-controlled styles of play. Players play the game from the perspective of elite fighter pilots of the Earth Defense Fleet, known as the Battle Squadron sent to rescue two human agents, Commanders Berry D. Mayers and Lori Bergin, from the clutches of the ruthless alien empire, known as the Barrax. The player's fighters carry unlimited projectile weaponry and a finite number of Nova Smart Bombs. Players acquire weapons by shooting down Barraxian Artillery Gunships which carry weapon Power-Up icons. Weapons include the Red Magnetic Torps, the powerful Green Emerald Laser, the two-way firing Blue Anti-Matter Particle Beam and the sideways firing Orange Magma Wave. Other pick-up items include Barraxian jewel caches marked by small green X's which are worth 1000 points each. The player has the option to increase the number and speed of enemy bullets therefore altering the game's difficulty. Notable features of the game are relatively big sprites (with Predator-esque cloaking effects applied to a few) and numerous weapon upgrades (supposedly 25 in total). Barraxian opponents consist of ground installations (generally gun turrets and launch platforms), ground vehicles, aircraft and numerous genetically-engineered living weapons. Specific enemies of note include: *Cargo vehicles that drop weapon upgrades upon destruction. *Four-craft squadrons of Barrax fighters that will release an extra, collectable Nova Bomb upon destruction of the entire squadron. *Two different varieties of gigantic, apparently robotic terror machines, functioning as the bosses of two separate levels. *What appear to be several giant faces in the terrain, once again, serving as end-of-level bosses. *The Barrax Nova Cruiser, the end-game boss.

The Springboks won 34‚Äì19, with Pretorius kicking three conversions and one penalty goal. He played in the subsequent 19‚Äì8 victory over the Welsh. He notched up one try, five conversions and three penalty goals in his third match as a Springbok against Argentina. After playing in another Test against Samoa, in which he again played a large role with his kicking ability, Pretorius was included in the Springboks 2002 Tri Nations Series squad. He played in three Tri Nations matches, two against the All Blacks and one against Australia, with South Africa losing all three. He earned a further three caps for the Springboks that year in November against Northern Hemisphere sides, playing matches against France, England and Scotland, all of which South Africa lost.

A Return to Love was a New York Times Best seller. Contents The book contains Williamson's reflections on the book A Course in Miracles and her thoughts on finding inner peace through love. Amazon.com describes its theme as \\"how we each can become a miracle worker by accepting God and by the expression of love in our daily lives.\\" The book is divided into two main parts, Principles and Practice. The Principles section has chapters entitled \\"Hell\\", \\"God\\", \\"You\\", \\"Surrender\\" and \\"Miracles\\". The Practice section has chapters \\"Relationships\\", \\"Body\\", \\"Work\\" and \\"Heaven\\". In each chapter, Williamson defines certain concepts. For example, she defines \\"darkness\\" as internalized fear. Williamson also provides personal experiences and anecdotes to further explain the concepts. Strong Christian references are woven throughout the book. The book is written with the understanding that the reader will have a working knowledge of religious concepts. Some of Williamson's explanations are not mainstream Christian theology views. For example, in chapter 3 (\\"You\\"), section 2 (\\"The divine mind\\"), when referring to Christ she writes \\"The word 'Christ' is a psychological term. No religion has a monopoly on the truth. Christ refers to the common thread of divine love that is the core and essence of every human mind.\\" Reception =Praise= Reviews of the book were generally favorable. A Return to Love spent 39 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list in 1992 and was number one on the Publishers Weekly non-fiction best-sellers list for 11 weeks. It was credited as having been written by one of the two authors that helped bring New Age perspectives to the American mainstream, the other being Thomas Moore. Williamson promoted the book as well as A Course in Miracles when she appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show, an episode that received more pro-viewer mail than any other show for 1992. She also spoke of the book, and The Course, when she was interviewed by Barbara Walters on the ABC television show 20/20.Skeptics Dictionary ACIM listing Retrieved June 30, 2006 In July 2012, twenty years after the book was published, Williamson was interviewed by Oprah Winfrey on a Super Soul Sunday (OWN TV) episode titled, \\"20 Years After A Return to Love\\". =Criticism= The book has also been labeled by critics as having paranormal and anti-science philosophy in regard to health issues. However, Williamson has rebuffed such framing: Chapter 8 of the book, titled \\"Body\\", is the most criticized. In it, Williamson states: * \\"A friend of mine told me that we're not punished for our sins, but by our sins. Sickness is not a sign of God‚Äôs judgment on us, but of our judgment on ourselves. If we were to think that God created our sickness, how could we turn to Him for healing? As we‚Äôve already established, God is all that is good. He creates only love, therefore he did not create sickness. Sickness is an illusion and does not actually exist. It is part of our worldly dream, our self-created nightmare. Our prayer to God is that He awaken us from the dream.\\" * ‚ÄúHealing results from transformed perception of our relationships to illness, one in which we respond to the problem with love instead of fear. When a child presents a cut finger to his or her mother, the woman doesn‚Äôt say, 'Bad cut.' Rather, she kisses the finger, showers it with love in an unconscious, instinctive activation of the healing process. Why should we think differently about critical illness? Cancer and AIDS and other serious illnesses are physical manifestations of a psychic scream and their message is not 'hate me, but 'Love me.'\\" * \\"In the traditional Western medical model, a healer‚Äôs job is to attack disease. But if the consciousness of attack is the ultimate problem, how could it be the ultimate answer? A miracle worker‚Äôs job is not to attack illness, but rather to stimulate the natural forces of healing. We turn our eyes away from sickness to the love that lies beyond it. No sickness can diminish our capacity to love. Does that mean that it is a mistake to take medicine? Absolutely not.\\" * \\"When the cure for AIDS is finally found, we will give prizes to a few scientists, but many of us will know that millions and millions of prayers helped it happen.\\" =Reviews= Bob Carroll, of The Skeptic's Dictionary, wrote: \\"Williamson might be called Oprah's patron saint. She's all about love and healing, yin and yang, being wounded, and using love and prayer to heal all wounds.\\" Writing in Commentary magazine, John Podhoretz described Return to Love as \\"almost unspeakably tasteless\\" in its blithe misappropriation of concepts central to the world's major religions...[it is] a work of surpassing vulgarity in a surpassingly vulgar field [that, nevertheless] offers both sound and surprisingly moving advice.\\" Readers are advised to seek meaning in something larger than themselves, to get over the issues of their past, and, \\"to act on wisdom from your grandmother, expressed in sugarcoated cliches: Always look on the bright side. If God gives you lemons, make lemonade.\\" Quotations Notable quotations from the book include: * \\"...a miracle is a reasonable thing to ask for.\\" * \\"A person acting from a motivation of contribution and service rises to such a level of moral authority that worldly success is a natural result.\\" =\\"Our deepest fear\\"= One particular passage from the book has become popular as an inspirational quotation: The passage was paraphrased in the 2005 film, Coach Carter, and in the 2006 film Akeelah and the Bee. It has also been popularized because it has mistakenly been attributed to Nelson Mandela since 1996. Williamson herself is quoted as saying, \\"As honored as I would be had President Mandela quoted my words, indeed he did not. I have no idea where that story came from, but I am gratified that the paragraph has come to mean so much to so many people.\\" Although Williamson is not a proclaimed Christian, the passage appears to echo the biblical passage stated by Jesus and found in Matthew 5:16, \\"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\\" References 1992 non-fiction books A Course in Miracles Debut books HarperCollins books Marianne Williamson New Age books Self-help books ","title":"A Return to Love"},{"id":"5756607","text":"David Clifford Davies (born 26 November 1959),Dod's Parliamentary Companion - Google Books commonly known as Dai Davies, is a Welsh politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Blaenau Gwent constituency in South Wales from 2006 to 2010, representing the Blaenau Gwent People's Voice Group. He was elected at a by-election in June 2006 following the death of independent MP Peter Law, but lost his seat the at the 2010 general election to Labour's Nick Smith by 10,516 votes. Background Davies was born in Ebbw Vale in 1959 and was the son and grandson of steelworkers. He attended Willowtown Secondary Modern School.The Almanac of British Politics - Robert Waller, Byron Criddle - Google Books After leaving school at the age of 16, Davies worked in the electrical department at the Ebbw Vale Steelworks for 26 years; he was a senior trade union shop steward for over 15 years and a member of the Nation Industrial Committee for Steel.No welcome in these valleys for Labour - Telegraph After losing his job at the steelworks that was shortly to close, he took a job with the union and he oversaw the loss of thousands of jobs. He was a trustee of the British Steel plc Pension Scheme. Davies was a voluntary school governor at both primary and secondary level, a former Chair of a Community Health Council and a Community First Partnership Board. He has been a Director of a Development Trust. Political career Davies was agent for both Llew Smith and Peter Law, and a political research officer and campaign manager for Law.https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jul/28/famous- independent-parliamentary-candidates Until his defeat in 2010, he was the leader of Blaenau Gwent People's Voice Group, a political party that had announced intentions to expand outside his own constituency in the 2007 Assembly elections. The election result was the first occasion an independent had held a seat occupied by a previous independent in a by-election since Sir C. V. F. Townshend held The Wrekin in 1920. The traditionally Labour seat 'returned to the fold' in electing Nick Smith on 6 May 2010, on a 29% swing to Labour and with a majority of over 10,000. Whilst Davies was in the House of Commons, two other MPs had the same phonetic name as him: David Davies, a Welsh Conservative MP elected in 2005, and David Davis, an English Conservative MP and runner-up in that party's previous leadership election. The resignation of Davis from the Commons in June 2008 allegedly proved problematic for the Monmouthshire MP, and one could assume that Dai Davies was also included in this confusion. On 23 June 2010, Davies gave his first interview since being defeated by his former party. He stated that he would be leaving frontline politics and standing down as Leader of The People's Voice; after these comments the future of the party he led from 2006 became unclear. He said he would still try and work for the people of Blaenau Gwent. Davies has refused to comment on recent rumours that he wants his former running mate Trish Law to stand aside and give him a chance of trying to win a seat in the National Assembly for Wales. In 2017 he was elected as one of three councillors for the Ebbw Vale North Ward on Blaenau Gwent Council.

Also listed are soldiers who defected to North Korea.  Background  Prisoner repatriation was one of the greatest stumbling blocks in the long cease-fire negotiations between the forces of the United Nations and those of China and North Korea. The warring factions finally agreed on an exchange of sick and wounded prisoners, Operation Little Switch, which was carried out in April and May 1953. That June, the two sides agreed that no prisoner who did not wish to be repatriated would be forced to do so (this had long been a sticking point in negotiations, with the Chinese and North Koreans wanting all prisoners returned to their home countries). Prisoners who did not wish to go back to their home countries would be given 90 days in a neutral compound near Panmunjom to reconsider before being allowed to stay in enemy territory. Following the armistice that was signed on 27 July 1953, effectively ending the Korean War (South Korea never signed), the main prisoner exchange was free to proceed. Operation Big Switch, the exchange of remaining prisoners of war, commenced in early August 1953, and lasted into December. 75,823 Communist fighters (70,183 North Koreans, 5,640 Chinese) were returned to their homelands. 12,773 U.N. soldiers (7,862 South Koreans, 3,597 Americans, and 946 British) were sent back south across the armistice line. Over 14,000 Communist soldiers, many of whom were former Republic of China soldiers who fought against the Communists in the Chinese Civil War, refused repatriation.Tucker, Spencer C. (2012). Almanac of American Military History. ABC-CLIO. Similarly, one Briton and 23 American soldiers (along with 327 South Koreans) also refused to be returned to their homelands. Two, Corporal Claude Batchelor and Corporal Edward Dickenson, changed their minds before the 90-day window expired. Both were court-martialed and sentenced to prison terms, with Batchelor serving 4¬Ω years and Dickenson 3¬Ω.Operations Big and Little Switch This left 22 U.N. soldiers who voluntarily stayed with the Communists after the final exchange of prisoners. The 21 Americans were given dishonorable discharges. This had the unintended consequence of rendering them immune to court-martial when they finally returned to the United States (which the majority eventually did), because they were no longer active-duty military. However, they were still criminally culpable for any acts of collaboration or offenses against fellow prisoners committed while they were POWs. At about 4:00 am on 24 February 1954, a train carrying the 21 American defectors crossed the Yalu River into China. The Chinese soon shipped some of the men off to study language and politics. Others went to mills, factories, and farms across Eastern China. However, all but 4 of them subsequently returned to the West. List of defectors =American= #Adams, Clarence (Cpl.). A soldier from Memphis, Tennessee. Adams, an African-American, cited racial discrimination in the United States as the reason he refused repatriation. While a prisoner, Adams took classes in Communist political theory, and afterwards lectured other prisoners in the camps. Because of this and other collaboration with his captors, his prosecution by the Army was likely upon his repatriation. During the Vietnam War, Adams made propaganda broadcasts for Radio Hanoi from their Chinese office, telling black American soldiers not to fight: \\"You are supposedly fighting for the freedom of the Vietnamese, but what kind of freedom do you have at home, sitting in the back of the bus, being barred from restaurants, stores and certain neighborhoods, and being denied the right to vote. ... Go home and fight for equality in America.\\" Adams married a Chinese woman and lived in China until the increasingly anti- Western atmosphere of the Cultural Revolution led him to return to the United States in 1966. The House Un-American Activities Committee subpoenaed Adams upon his return but did not question him publicly. He later started a Chinese restaurant business in Memphis. Clarence Adams died in 1999. Adams' autobiography An American Dream: The Life of an African American Soldier and POW Who Spent Twelve Years in Communist China was posthumously published in 2007 by his daughter Della Adams and Lewis H.

Allegations of biological warfare during the Korean War have been reported to have influenced Condron's decision to live in China; however, those who knew him have said he was motivated by admiration of Maoism and Marxist theory. Regarding his desertion Condron said \\"I made my gesture because I am against war. I have spent my years in China learning a lot.\\" The British Government refused to rule out the possibility of arrest and trial if he returned to the United Kingdom. Regarding Condron, Lieutenant Colonel J. L. Lindop of the Intelligence Division of the Admiralty stated that the Royal Navy \\"regard Condron as a deserter and ... he is liable to be arrested and charged with desertion\\" and as a result it was difficult for Condron to return to the UK. In 1955, Condron was included in the editor's list for a book entitled: Thinking Soldiers ‚Äì by Men Who Fought in Korea. In the following quotation written by Condron he expresses his disillusionment with military life: > '... the soldier today can no longer be viewed as a robot. The more > different kinds of experience he has, the more he fits them together in his > mind. That is why all those who consider the soldier merely as a thing to be > used, like the rifle he carries or the pack he wears, are bound to come out > very badly in their calculations.

Despite political and personal reasons for his defection, Condron's lifestyle in China challenged the core socialist values of the regime. The Foreign Office and British Embassy in Beijing reported Condron had been drinking \\"on a fairly hearty scale\\" and fraternising with Chinese girls, which was taboo at the time. In 1959 Condron was in a relationship with Jaquelin Hsiung-Baudet, an illegitimate daughter of the French diplomat Philipe Baudet whom he met while working as an English teacher at the Beijing Language and Culture University. Condron returned to the United Kingdom in 1960 due to growing xenophobia in China, and received an honourable discharge from the Royal Marines. In 1962 Jaquelin moved to the UK to join her then husband. In 1963 Condron worked selling the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica door-to-door, while Jaquelin worked at the BBC World Service. Condron and his wife had a son, Simon, who attended the University of Cambridge in the 1970s. Jaquelin divorced Condron due to alcoholism and later emigrated to the US. His son, Simon, worked at the BBC and Condron lived in his London flat until his death in March 1996 aged 68.

Reilly. It was released by the Buena Vista Distribution Company. Plot Set in the late 1580s, the film very loosely follows the real-life exploits of the 16th century Irish prince Hugh Roe \\"Red Hugh\\" O'Donnell. The story begins when Hugh's father, the Chief of the Name, dies, leaving his son as Chief of Clan O'Donnell. With his ascension to the throne, an Irish prophecy is seemingly fulfilled which promises independence from Elizabethan and English rule. In response, the Queen's Lord Lieutenant abducts him and imprisons him in Dublin Castle as a hostage for the Clan's good behavior. After a daring escape, he flies across Ireland with the sons of Hugh Roe O'Neill. The O'Donnell lords see this occurrence as the opportunity to strike back at the foreigners by force, but Hugh convinces them the right plan is to band together with the other clans of the island, and bargain for their freedom from a position of strength. As he prepares for battle, O'Donnell also courts the beautiful Kathleen McSweeney, to further augment the clans of Ireland.

He is best known for his light art, which he named lumia, and his designs for color organs called Clavilux. Wilfred was not fond of the term \\"color organ\\", and coined the word \\"Clavilux\\" from Latin meaning \\"light played by key\\". His innovative, kinetic works prefigured the advent of light art in America, and influenced subsequent generations of visual artists. Biography Wilfred's father ran a photography studio, and young Wilfred was exposed to the arts at a young age. He studied painting and poetry in Paris, and found early success as \\"Wilfred the Lute Player\\" traveling Europe and America performing minstrel songs on the archaic lute. Around 1905, Wilfred began to experiment with bits of colored glass and light sources. After moving to New York he, along with Claude Fayette Bragdon and 'Kirk' Kirkpatrick Brice cofounded a group of Theosophists called the Prometheans. The Prometheans were dedicated to exploring spiritual matters through modern artistic expression. Brice served also as patron to the group. While many people had experimented with light as an artistic medium (most notably the color organs) Wilfred was the first to speak of light as a formal art. He coined the term \\"lumia\\" to describe \\"an eighth art\\" where light would stand on its own as an expressive art-form. Wilfred was passionate that lumia should be a silent art. Wilfred's mechanisms were often complex designs that have been described as from the \\"Rube Goldberg school\\". He was a trained artist, but had little mechanical schooling. That said, his devices were very sturdy, and many still function with most of the original parts. In 1919, Wilfred constructed the Clavilux Model A in his Long Island studio (located on the Brice estate). The first public recital came in 1922 and featured performances on the Clavilux Model B for audiences at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York. The press was highly receptive. In the audience that first night was Leopold Stokowski. The Clavilux was a complex instrument which allowed a person to create and perform lumia compositions. Later models B-H were touring and lecture models, the last one being built prior to W.W.II. Wilfred founded the Art Institute of Light, which had a recital hall in Chelsea, and then later at the Grand Central Palace. World War II found the Grand Central Palace theatre turned into an Army induction center, and Wilfred did his part for the Allies by serving as a translator. After the war, Wilfred no longer performed Clavilux recitals, concentrating his work on recorded lumia and theatrical projection. Wilfred was also an early pioneer in working with projected scenery for the theatre. His initial success in this was a 1930 Broadway production of Ibsen's The Vikings. Wilfred did seminal work in the 1950s with the University of Washington's John Ashby Conway in this field. Clavilux works Starting in the late 1920s, Wilfred began to create smaller, less complex lumia devices, some were meant for home exhibition, while others were designed for installation in museums and art galleries: * Tabletop Clavilux, or \\"Luminar\\" * Home Clavilux, or \\"Clavilux Jr.\\" * Home Clavilux (these differed from the Clavilux Jr.) * Recorded Lumia Compositions Starting in 1931, he began to shift his emphasis with lumia from concert recitals to museum and gallery exhibitions. There are only about thirty-five extant Clavilux Jr. and lumia compositions. Wilfred has explicitly stated his objections to recording lumia works on film (in his writings collected in Thomas Wilfred's Clavilux), making the survival of his works dependent on the existence of his machines. Most of the extant works are in the Epstein Collection, and the Epstein family has loaned lumia compositions to museums world-wide. In 2003, two of the original Clavilux (Models E & G) were rescued from an East Village eviction dumpster, and are now stored in Seattle, Washington awaiting restoration by the Epsteins. Museum Exhibitions In 1952, he was included in the influential Museum of Modern Art exhibition 15 Americans, alongside Abstract Expressionists such as Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Mark Rothko. At this point in his career, Wilfred shifted from a musical to a painting-based analogy for lumia in an attempt to explain it to the broader public. One of his installations, \\"Lumia Suite, Opus 158,\\" enchanted MoMA visitors from 1964 until 1980, when it was dismantled and placed in storage. The Museum of Modern Art owns three Wilfred lumia compositions, and many artists of the Psychedelic era were inspired to work with light after seeing the MoMA compositions. Because of his influence on this generation of artists, Wilfred's final work \\"Lucatta, Opus 162\\" was included in the \\"Summer of Love\\" exhibition, which was hosted by the Whitney Museum in the spring of 2007. In 2017, Yale University Art Gallery organized the first exhibition dedicated solely to Wilfred and his light compositions in more than forty years. It was on view at Yale University Art Gallery from February 17, 2017 ‚Äì July 23, 2017, before traveling to the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C. from October 6, 2017 ‚Äì January 7, 2018.  In popular culture  In 2011, brief excerpts of \\"Opus 161\\", Wilfred's penultimate lumia work, was featured at several important points in the Terrence Malick film The Tree of Life.

The words are by Cecil Frances Alexander and were first published in her Hymns for Little Children. The melody originated from the 17th-century English country dance tune \\"The 29th of May.\\" This was later adapted by Martin Shaw and William Henry Monk. There have also been other adaptations, such as a full choral piece by John Rutter. In earlier editions of the Church of Scotland's Church Hymnary, the tunes \\"God in Nature\\" by John Stainer and \\"All Things Bright\\" by Frederick Arthur Gore Ouseley had been used. The chorus has been recommended as a Christian song for children to learn, even for children as young as five years of age.The Power to Comprehend with All the Saints: The Formation and Practice of a Pastor-Theologian, edited by Wallace M. Alston Jr., Cynthia A. Jarvis, page 44, from the chapter entitled \\"Raising Pastor-Theologians\\" by Brant S. Copeland History The hymn was first published in 1848 in Mrs Cecil Alexander's Hymns for Little Children. It consists of a series of stanzas that elaborate upon verses of the Apostles' Creed. It may have been inspired by Psalm 104, verses 24 and 25: \\"Oh Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts\\". The hymn may have been inspired as well by a verse from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner: \\"He prayeth best, who loveth best; All things great and small; For the dear God who loveth us; He made and loveth all.\\" Alternatively, inspiration may have come from William Paley's Natural Theology, published in 1802, that argues for God as the designer of the natural world. For example, the hymn's second verse alludes to \\"wings\\" and verse 7 refers to \\"eyes\\". Paley cited wings and eyes as examples of complexity of design, analogous to that of a watch, with God as the Divine Watchmaker. Alexander's composition of the hymn's text has been attributed to four locations: Llanwenarth House in Govilon, Monmouthshire ‚Äì the refrain \\"The purple headed mountains, The river running by\\" possibly referring to the Sugar Loaf and Blorenge mountains and to the River Usk; Markree Castle near Sligo, and Minehead and the nearby village of Dunster in 1848, in which case the \\"purple headed mountain\\" might refer to Grabbist Hill and the river to the River Avill. However, a more credible account is given by Sir John Heygate of Bellarena House in County Londonderry, which links the hymn to the many visits paid by the Alexanders to what was then the Gage family residence, a fmily into which Sir John's ancestor -Sir Frederick Heygate-married in 1850. Writing in 1973, Sir John attributed \\"the purple headed mountain\\" to nearby Benevenagh, and \\"the river running by\\" to the River Roe which flows past Bellerena House. Sir John had heard the story from the late Sir Norman Stronge, speaker of the Northern Ireland House of Commons, whose family also had ties to the area. Words Alexander's text reads:Hymns Ancient and Modern (Second Edition ‚Äì 1875) :1. :All things bright and beautiful, :All creatures great and small, :All things wise and wonderful, :The Lord God made them all. :2. :Each little flower that opens, :Each little bird that sings, :He made their glowing colours, :He made their tiny wings. :All things bright ... :3. :The rich man in his castle, :The poor man at his gate, :God made them high and lowly, :And ordered their estate. :All things bright ... :4. :The purple headed mountain, :The river running by, :The sunset and the morning, :That brightens up the sky;‚àí :All things bright ... :5. :The cold wind in the winter, :The pleasant summer sun, :The ripe fruits in the garden,‚àí :He made them every one: :All things bright ... :6. :The tall trees in the greenwood, :The meadows where we play, :The rushes by the water, :We gather every day;‚àí :All things bright ... :7. :He gave us eyes to see them, :And lips that we might tell, :How great is God Almighty, :Who has made all things well. :All things bright ... :(Amen) Many later versions and performances of the hymn omit the third verse. http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/a/l/l/allthing.htm The United Church of Canada includes a fourth verse: \\"The rocky mountain splendour, / the lone wolf's haunting call, / the Great Lakes and the prairies, / the forest in the fall.\\"Voices United: The Hymn and Worship Book of the United Church of Canada, (Toronto: The United Church Publishing House, c. 1996), #291 Cultural references The second line was used as the title to James Herriot's book All Creatures Great and Small, which was centred around a veterinarian practice in 1930s Yorkshire in Northern England. Subsequently it became the title of the film and television series. Later Herriot used the rest of the lines of the refrain for the books that followed: All Things Bright and Beautiful, All Things Wise and Wonderful, and The Lord God Made Them All. In the 1970 film Beneath the Planet of the Apes, a congregation of mutated humans, who worship an atomic bomb, sing a hymn adapted from All Things Bright and Beautiful. Script-writer Paul Dehn specifically wanted his new lyrics to be used not as a parody, but to emphasise that the mutants genuinely regarded themselves as beautiful. The hymn was parodied by The Goodies on their 1978 The Goodies Beastly Record as \\"I'm a Carnivore\\". They had previously recorded a cover of it on their 1973 The Goodies Sing Songs from The Goodies and an earlier version was heard on the BBC Radio show I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again, of whose cast all three Goodies were part, in 1966. It was also parodied by the Monty Python song \\"All Things Dull and Ugly\\", included on their 1980 album Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album and on the 1989 collection Monty Python Sings. The music of the William Henry Monk arrangement is used in a famous (within Australia) 1988 television advertisement for the Australian RSPCA, still shown on Australian television. The advertisement shows numerous animals (including, among many others, deer, an elephant, mice, a raccoon, kangaroos, an ostrich, cows and a wombat) passing by the viewer in front of a plain background while the music plays. At the end of the parade of animals, a voice states: \\"RSPCA. For all creatures great and small\\". Comedian Stewart Lee parodied the hymn with a routine that deconstructed its lyrics, criticising the redundancy in them through the use of a Venn diagram. The title of the poem is also the title for the third studio album by the synthpop act Owl City, released in June 2011. The Hong Kong animated McDull films contain a childish version of the song sung in a Cantonese accent by The Pancakes. A cinema advert for the environmental group Friends of the Earth's Scottish branch depicted the world disappearing while a single child sings the first verse of the song, amending the last line (\\"The Lord God made them all\\") to \\"All gone; we killed them all\\". Michael Markowski quotes the melody in his 2009 concert band composition, Instinctive Travels. This song plays in the background of Donna and Joe's wedding in a 2015 episode of Parks and Recreation.

Mobberley railway station is on the Manchester to Chester line. Manchester Airport lies to the north of the village.  History  Mobberley is mentioned, as \\"Motburlege\\", in the Domesday Book of 1086. A priory was located here. Antrobus Hall was built in 1709. The church was mainly constructed around 1245. It was originally dedicated to both St Wilfrid & St Mary although in recent years St Mary has been \\"dropped\\". Hill House, is a 17th century black and white timbered framed house, that was originally in Woodlane Mobberley. It was the home of the Bacon family. The house was deconstructed and rebuilt on Nursery Lane in Nether Alderley to avoid destruction by the building of the second runway at Manchester Airport. The Grade II listed Hanson House, formerly the home of the Riddick family, was similarly relocated due to the runway construction, and is now located on Moss Lane, Siddington. Mobberley was the home of the Mallory family: George Mallory (1886‚Äì1924), a mountaineer who died attempting Mount Everest, and Air Chief Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory (1892‚Äì1944), who was air commander for the Allied Invasion of Normandy during World War II were both born in Mobberley. Their father, The Rev. Herbert Leigh Mallory, was rector of Mobberley. The Victory Hall was built in 1921 as a World War I memorial at a cost of ¬£4,500 on a plot of three quarters of an acre given by Mr R O Leycester. It was officially opened on 30 December 1921 and was refurbished in 1992. It is also home to many village organisations including the Women's Institute, Village Society and playgroup and is a regular place for locals ‚Äì and wider ‚Äì to hold a variety of celebrations and meetings. Mobberley has seen much change in recent years: first the opening of the nearby M56 from Manchester to Chester and then the Second Runway at Manchester Airport. These developments have led to Mobberley becoming largely a dormitory village of Manchester. Mobberley is well served by pubs. Mobberley appears in the opening chapter of the children's fantasy novel The Weirdstone of Brisingamen by Alan Garner.

Owing to the partnership's bidding system or a bridge convention, partner must \\"keep the bidding open\\", i.e. not pass, thereby preventing his left-hand opponent from ending the auction with a pass and enabling the \\"forcing bidder\\" to bid further. A forcing bid that creates no further obligation is called forcing for one round. A bid that is forcing and promises a rebid creates an obligation on the forcing bidder next round (typically, up to some level of the auction). A game forcing bids creates a mutual obligation to continue bidding at least to game level, or to double the opponents. All bridge bidding systems use forcing bids. For instance, one over one and two over one responses to one-of-a-suit opening bids are treated as forcing in almost all bidding systems. Also, introducing a new suit at three level is generally treated as forcing provided this bid is made in a non-limited hand. The main reason it is necessary to have certain bids in the system designated as forcing is to allow the partnership to start a dialogue exploring for the right contract. Partnership agreement on which bids are forcing is essential. This is no easy territory, as is exemplified by the fact that in certain auctions even a pass can be forcing. In particular, the following bidding situations require agreement as to their forcing character, i.e. non-forcing, round forcing or forcing to a specified level: * responses to preempts * responses to overcalls * various responses to a reverse bid of opener * 2NT in competitive bidding situations See also * Forcing pass References Contract bridge bidding ","title":"Forcing bid"},{"id":"5756683","text":"Sphaeropteris albidosquamata, synonym Cyathea albidosquamata, is a species of tree fern native to the Maluku Islands and New Guinea, where it grows in rain forest and montane forest at an altitude of 1200‚Äì1500 m.

The Folly had fallen into disrepair but was restored in 2002 by Mr. Jeff Pears, upon whose land it is sited. He rebuilt it at his own expense as a gift to the community of Penistone. It has since occasionally been open to the public, such as on 1 August 2006 when Penistone hosted the ‚ÄòYorkshire Day‚Äô celebrations.

His stories have been translated into many languages. Education Long is a 1971 graduate of Upland High School in Upland, California, Long studied humanities at the University of LaVerne (graduating with departmental honors), Claremont Graduate School and Claremont School of Theology. Stonemasters John Long joined teenage climbers John Bachar, Rick Accomazzo, Richard Harrison, Tobin Sorenson, Robs Muir, Gib Lewis (climber), Lynn Hill, Jim Wilson, and Mike Graham as members of a group of climbers in Yosemite Valley, known as the \\"Stonemasters\\". As the result of the groups exploits, from the French Alps to the North Pole, combined with Long's popular writings, the Stonemaster ethos was central in the \\"extreme\\" adventure sports culture. While Long and the Stonemasters branched out into diverse disciplines including caving, river running and first descents, extreme skiing, big wave surfing, trans- continental traverses, BASE jumping and Himalaya alpine climbing, the original renown sprang from establishing scores of daring new rock climbs‚Äîthroughout the 1970s and 1980s‚Äîin Southern California and Northern Mexico, most notably at Tahquitz and Suicide Rock in Idyllwild, Joshua Tree National Park, and Yosemite Valley, all in California, and El Gran Trono Blanco, in Baja, Mexico. Noted climbs Long's many climbing feats include the first one-day ascent of the most sought after rock climb in North America, the 3,000 foot Nose route on El Capitan, on Memorial Day, 1975, with Jim Bridwell and Billy Westbay. The following year, partnered with Dale Bard, Long made the second one-day ascent of El Cap via the West Face, in the remarkable time of five hours. He followed this with blitz ascents of Leaning Tower, Washington Column, Half Dome and Ribbon Falls, precipitating the modern speed climbing movement so popular today, both in Yosemite Valley and beyond. After the First One Day Ascent of El Capitan, Yosemite Valley, California A skilled free climber, Long popularized \\"free soloing\\" (climbing with no rope) during his high school days out at Joshua Tree National Park, first introducing John Bachar to the practice in 1974 with their now f√™ted ascent of Double Cross, at Joshua Tree. Bachar would soon establish himself as the world's leading solo rock climber. In 1977, Long and Bachar toured the Western States, repeating most of John Gill's notorious boulder problems at Horse Tooth Reservoir, Ft. Collins, Split Rocks, Estes Park, the Badlands, Pueblo (all in Colorado), and at the Needles of South Dakota. Long's two seminal photo articles, \\"Pumping Sandstone,\\" in 1976, and \\"Pumping Granite,\\" in 1977, both featured in Climbing Magazine, inspired an entire generation of free climbers throughout the US and Western Europe, and helped establish bouldering in general, and \\"High Balling\\" (high bouldering sans rope) in particular, as a valid and extreme expression of traditional climbing. Long's 1973 ascent of Paisano Overhang (5.12c) at Suicide Rock in Southern California, helped to firmly establish the 5.12 grade and was likely the most technically difficult free climb in the world at that time. His 1978 ascent of Hangover (5.13b), at nearby Tahquitz Rock, was arguably the first climb achieved at that grade. In 1975, along with Ron Kauk and John Bachar, Long became the first to free climb a legitimate big wall with the first free ascent of the East Face of Washington Column, in Yosemite Valley, later dubbed Astroman, for two decades widely considered \\"The World‚Äôs Greatest Free Climb.\\" The following year, also in Yosemite, and with British climber Pete Livesey, Long free climbed the second big wall in history ‚Äì the 1,700 foot Chouinard/Herbert route on Sentinel Rock. On June 15, 2011, Alex Honnold free soloed the Chouinard/Herbert for CBS News, with Long hosting alongside 60 Minutes correspondent, Lara Logan. Starting in 1980, with a kayaking expedition to Baja California, Long transitioned into international exploration. Many notable expeditions followed, including the first coast-to- coast traverse of Borneo, transcontinental traverse of Irian Jaya, discovery and exploration of the world's largest river cave, Gulf Province, Papua New Guinea, First Descent, Angel Falls, Venezuela, First Descent of the Kayan River, Kalimantan, Indonesia, as well as expeditions to the Troll Wall, Norway, Hand of Fatima, Mali, West Africa, Mt. Asgard, Baffin Island, Ellesmere Island and the North Pole. Film and television Starting in 1980, Long began working for David Frost Productions, writing and producing ABC and BBC specials, including the International Guinness Book of World Records, which also became a long-running syndicated series. Moving into feature films in the 1990s, Long worked on the second unit for dozens of motion pictures, including the Rambo series. His novella, Rogue‚Äôs Babylon, was the basis for Sylvester Stallone's hit movie, Cliffhanger. During this time Long also worked for Bennett Productions, in Santa Monica, writing and producing action sport shows for TBS, NBC, CBS, FOX, HDTV, RUSH and others. Highlights include the Emmy nominated Red Bull Cliff Diving World Championships in La‚Äônai, Hawaii, and the International Monitor Award (International Emmy) Winning show, Hawaiian Waterman (big wave surfing), for Asahi (Japanese HD TV). Later work with New Wave Entertainment involved writing and producing long form shows for Discovery, History Channel, Showtime, A&E;, Lifetime, and HBO. His 2008 documentary for Code Black Entertainment and Ebony Magazine, Why We Laugh: The History of African American Humor, was a featured documentary (Spectrum Series) at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. His most recent (2010) DVD, Who You Callin‚Äô Crazy? featured comedian Katt Williams. In September 2013, Long and Jeff Jackson, were signed by Steven Schwartz and Chockstone Pictures to write Chico Jones (working title), based in part on Long's previous short story volume, Gorilla Monsoon. One Night Stand (also written with Jeff Jackson), a new television series, is currently in development with producer Randy Cordray, longtime producer of the hit series The Office, and current producer of the series Dads (Fox). Books Long has over forty titles varying from Pale Moon: American Indian Folklore and Legends, to short-form literary fiction anthologies, to photos/narrative books on beach culture and big wave surfing. His how-to books on adventure sports have been industry leaders for twenty years. His Advanced Rock Climbing won the Banff Film Festival Award for Mountain Exposition, and he is the 2006 recipient of the Literary Award from the American Alpine Club, their highest honor, rarely bestowed. In the Aug/Sep 2009 issue of Rock & Ice magazine, Long was recognized as \\"the most influential adventurer in the world\\" over the last twenty‚Äìfive years, principally owing to his writing. He has had literary best sellers in Polish (Long on Adventure) and Spain (Rogue‚Äôs Babylon). His large format book, The Stonemasters: California Rock Climbers in the Seventies, was released in October 2009, and on November 4, 2010, won the Grand Prize at the Banff Mountain Book Festival. Yosemite: The Vertical Evolution, another large format book on modern free climbing in Yosemite, was released in July 2011. The Big Juice, companion to The Big Drop, Long's seminal big wave surfing book of 2000, was released in August 2011. Stone Nudes, a hardback, black and white art photo book (photography by seminal fashion shooter, Dean Fidelman) with essays, was released to international critical acclaim in January 2011,. Long's work with other photographers includes Sand in my Hair: Beach Culture so Help me God, with Dane Peterson and Glam Utopia, on high fashion models, with photographer Jim Herrington. TheTrad Climber‚Äôs Bible, co-written with Peter Croft and featuring the photography of Nat Geo shooter Andrew Burr (and others) went to press in November 2013, and will be Falcon Press's major release for 2014. Long has also agreed to write another large format, retro art book (on the 1950s) with designer Tom Adler and photographer Dean Fidelman, the team that previous partnered for the acclaimed Stonemaster book.

He was appointed by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, and later served under subsequent Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert and Binyamin Netanyahu. Early life and education Diskin was born in Givatayim. In 1974 he joined the Israel Defense Forces, and served as deputy company commander of Sayeret Shaked, the command Sayeret of the Israeli Southern Command. Diskin obtained a bachelor's degree in Israeli Studies and political science from Bar Ilan University, and a master's degree in political science and public administration from the University of Haifa. Career in the secret service, 1978-2011 In 1978, following his mandatory military service, Diskin joined the Shabak and in the following years served in several operational positions in the Nablus district in the Judea and Samaria region, and in Beirut and Sidon during the 1982 Lebanon War. In 1984 he was appointed head of operations in the Nablus district and by 1989, the Jenin and Tulkarm districts, also in the northern Judea and Samaria area. During this time he was in charge of gathering and analyzing intelligence on the activities of terrorist groups in the area, and performing operations based on this intelligence. In 1990, he was appointed head of department in Shabak's Counter Terrorism Division, which was responsible for the collection and analysis of intelligence and carrying out operations based on information received. In 1993 he was entrusted, by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and then- director general of the Shabak Yaakov Peri, to establish ties with the Palestinian security forces as part of the Oslo Peace Accord.Al Kotzo Shel Yod, Yedioth Ahronoth, 27.5.2011 (Hebrew) In 1994, he became the overall head of the Intelligence and Counter Terrorism Division and Counter Intelligence Division. In 1997, Diskin was appointed commander of the Jerusalem District. During his tenure, the Shabak developed sophisticated operating methods, advanced technological and data mining capabilities, and by implementing them was able to debilitate Hamas's military wing in the Judea and Samaria area, which led to a major decline in the number of terrorist and suicide attacks in Israel. From 2000 to 2003, as the Shabak's Deputy Director, he implemented the use of advanced technological methods and operational doctrines. During the time of the Second Intifada, Diskin led the Shabak's activities in the field of counter-terrorism, developing operational capabilities and countermeasures against the suicide attacks, that had cost hundreds of lives. He also developed the doctrine of \\"Command and Control Operation Centers\\" (CCOC), in which he established a combined intelligence gathering, analysis and implementation process between the Shabak and different intelligence and security bodies in order to produce more accurate, actionable intelligence. In 2003, during a sabbatical, he became special advisor to Mossad Director, Meir Dagan. During this time he established a methodology for the Mossad's new operational tactics. On May 15, 2005, he was appointed by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to replace Avi Dichter as the Director of the Shabak. In 2006, the Shabak's major concerns were suicide attacks, obtaining highly accurate intelligence, and assessing the situation in regards to the elections in the Palestinian Legislative Council. Diskin and the Shabak were among the few people in the Israeli security forces who predicted Hamas winning the elections. Later that year, Diskin warned about the increasing rate of smuggling in the Philadelphi Route, which was under Egyptian control, and stated that in two years the Gaza strip would become a \\"Lebanon\\". In accordance, the Shabak focused on improving its technological, operational and intelligence-gathering capabilities at the Egyptian border. Diskin publicly objected to the prisoner exchange in which Gilad Shalit was released. He iterated that his objection was based on the perception that this sort of exchange encourages the kidnapping of soldiers and civilians, strengthens the terrorist infrastructure in the long term, and weakens Israel's deterrence capabilities. During his tenure as Director, Diskin led the development of the Shabak's cyber capabilities. These counter-cyberterrorism capabilities are both offensive‚Äîpreventing terrorist and suicide attacks to the point of their termination in Israel,Shabak Official Website as well as defensive, as in protecting Israel's essential infrastructure, such as electricity, transport, telecommunications and banking. He also championed a revision in Israel's Counter Cyber Threats Authority, transforming it from a purely regulatory body to an active body, which works toward identifying and preventing cyber attacks. In 2009, in an unusual act, the Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu requested Diskin to extend his service, due to his integral and unique role in maintaining the national security of Israel.Diskin service extended, Ynet 25.10.2009 On May 15, 2011, Diskin was replaced as Director by his former deputy, Yoram Cohen. Career since 2011 In 2011, Diskin co- founded with the former head of operational technologies department and the former head of the IT department in the Shabak, a high-tech cyber security company, where he serves as chairman. The company offers cyber security solutions for major multinational corporations. In February 2015, Avi Primor, ex ambassador to Germany, introduced Diskin as the head of Diskin Advanced Technologies to Ferdinand Pi√´ch, VW-CEO \\"as a favor\\". As a result of the meeting Diskin and Pi√´ch founded a company named Cymotive Technologies in Herzliya, with 40% ownership through VW¬¥s AutoVision, and 60% by Diskin Advanced Technologies, to close cybersecurity gaps of linked cars. Primor told Pi√´ch about the impending dieselgate. =Views and opinions= In January 2013, prior to Israel's parliamentary elections, Diskin harshly criticized Binyamin Netanyahu¬¥s leadership. Diskin, along with former Mossad Director Meir Dagan and former IDF Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi, have been highly critical of the diplomatic positions of Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition; since his retirement from the Shabak, he has spoken on a number of occasions on his view of the need for diplomatic progress vis-√†-vis the Palestinian Authority and the wider Arab world. Personal life Diskin is married to Dr. Isabel Arend Diskin, Cognitive Neuroscience researcher in Ben-Gurion University.

In Japan, structural engineers designing structures exceeding a certain floor area or number of storeys must submit drawings and calculations to the authorities, demonstrating that the building is safe (e.g. earthquake-resistant, etc.) \\"Structural Calculation Forgery Problem\\" (ÊßãÈÄ†Ë®àÁÆóÊõ∏ÂÅΩÈÄ†ÂïèÈ°å, k≈çz≈ç keisansho giz≈ç mondai) refers to a series of incidents, set off by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport's November 17, 2005, announcement that structural engineer Hidetsugu Aneha of Aneha Architectural Design Office in Chiba Prefecture had falsified earthquake design calculations. A number of Japanese construction and real estate companies have had to declare bankruptcy due to their involvement in the affair, including Kimura Construction and Huser. Note that Aneha is frequently referred to as an architect, as Japan has a unique licensing system where structural engineers designing buildings are registered as first-class architects. It is suggested that one of the causes for the problem was that the (privately owned) oversight agencies responsible for confirming compliance to Japanese safety standards did not detect the forgery. Prior to 1999, oversight was managed solely by regional governments, however, a change made to Japanese law that year allowed private organizations to conduct investigations as well. It was said that these private organizations, such as \\"EHomes\\" and \\"Nihon ERI\\" did not adequately function in their oversight roles, however, it was later revealed that government oversight agencies had also failed to detect some instances of forgery. Of 14 hotels that had already been built under false pretenses when the problem first came to light, two of them were shown to fail Japan's earthquake resistance standards. Because the concrete had insufficient reinforcing steel, there was a fear that an earthquake of magnitude 5 on the Japanese Shindo scale could cause the buildings to collapse. None of the buildings in question have yet collapsed, but the safety of high-rise buildings in earthquake-prone Japan has been called into question, particularly in the light of the 1995 Sampoong Department Store collapse in Korea. Residents of the areas around the affected buildings live in a constant state of unease, not knowing if or when the buildings will collapse. Some hotels, unable to guarantee the safety of their customers, have ceased operations. As the architect concerned in the matter has participated in the construction of a large number of buildings, the full extent of the problem is still unknown. In Japan, the incident was first publicized by bloggers. Hidetsugu Aneha, Moriyoshi Kimura, Akira Shinozuka and Togo Fujita etc. were arrested on April 26, 2006, and Huser's president Susumu Ojima was arrested on May 17 of the same year.

She was the youngest ever minister appointed in Belgium.  Education and move into politics  Freya Van den Bossche followed her secondary education at the Royal Atheneum Voskenslaan in Ghent. She studied law from 1993 to 1995 at the University of Ghent, but did not obtain a degree, and ultimately graduated from the University of Ghent with a master's degree in Communication Sciences in 1999. From 1996 to 1997, she studied at the University of Amsterdam as part of an exchange programme. In 2006, while she was vice-premier in the federal government, Knack, a prominent Flemish magazine in Belgium alleged that she had not written the obligatory thesis for her master's degree herself. Rather, due to the complexity of the thesis she submitted, Knack journalist alleged that the thesis had actually been written by , also a former Knack journalist and a friend of Freya Van den Bossche's father, the prominent socialist politician, Luc Van den Bossche. Knack posted a version of her thesis online, but offered no other proof. Freya Van den Bossche subsequently submitted a criminal complaint against Koen Meulenaere for slander and defamation. In response to a question posed by the Flemish newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws on whether she did in fact write her thesis, Ms. Van den Bossche replied: \\"Would that make a difference? I can show you my notes because I have nothing to hide\\". Knack ultimately removed the thesis from its website and ceased coverage of the matter. From 1999 to 2000, she found employment as an Attach√©e, responsible for communication and drug-related problems, of the then Mayer of Ghent Frank Beke. Freya first came to national attention in Belgium in a televised debating competition between candidates in a municipal election who were the children of well-known politicians. She performed strongly in the debate and was considered by many to be very attractive and articulate. In addition, during the campaign her election advertising included a postcard of a black and white photograph that included her long bare legs that was quite revealing, showing a black slip. Partly as a result of these profile building exercises, Freya polled well and was elected in that municipal poll in 2000.  Federal minister  She was quickly promoted and was put on her Social Democrat Party's list in East Flanders for the federal parliament in 2003, attracting 105,000 votes. On 12 July 2003 she was appointed the youngest minister in Belgium's historyTime article on gender quotas appointed aged 28 as Minister of Environment, Consumer Affairs and Sustainable Development in Government Verhofstadt II. In July 2004, she became responsible for Work and Consumer Affairs. After the departure of Johan Vande Lanotte in October 2005 she was again promoted, this time to become the nation's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Budget and Consumer Affairs. She lost that position in 2008 when the government fell. In a recent poll she was rated as the seventh most popular politician in Belgium. A Spanish newspaper included her in an internet poll of the world's most beautiful female politicians. Time magazine wrote about her: But by the time she ran for national parliament as a Flemish Socialist (SP.A) candidate in 2003, the law required that both sexes be represented in the top three slots on every party list ‚Äì so her name was placed in a vote-getting position no novice male would have enjoyed. And part of her popularity, it must be said, has to do with her bright blue eyes and throaty voice.

Since 2003, its Australian sites became a joint venture between Village Roadshow and Amalgamated Holdings Limited (AHL) (Now known as Event Hospitality and Entertainment), forming Australian Theatres. Previous to this, Village Cinemas was the founding entity of parent company, Village Roadshow from 1954 when the first drive-in theatre was established, and from 1988 Warner Bros. owned a third share in the chain. The Village Cinemas brand also operates in various forms within some international markets, either as a joint venture with Village Roadshow, or under licence, where they also operate within Event Hospitality and Entertainment's Event Cinemas/Greater Union/Birch Carroll & Coyle, and many international cinema chains. Village Cinemas has output deals with all major film distributors and selectively screens some independently sourced films depending on material. History Bourke Street in the Melbourne CBD. It operated from 1986 to 2006, with Village Roadshow's headquarters located in the upper levels (the HQ has since been relocated to The Jam Factory near their other cinemas). Some of its opening movies were Short Circuit and The Color Purple. This building has since being redeveloped and renamed as, '206 Bourke Street.' In 1954, the company origins of Village Roadshow and Village Cinemas came from the foundation in one of Australia's first drive-in theatre operations in Croydon, an outer Eastern suburb of Melbourne (Melbourne's third drive-in, but only the fourth in the entire country), established by Roc Kirby. The drive-in was adjacent to the shopping strip, Croydon Village; hence the company adopted the 'Village' name. Kirby had already operated traditional indoor cinemas, under the Kirby Theatres name, but the outdoor Village-brand concept was to provide the motor for the company's growth. The original Village Drive-In featured capacity for 454 cars, later being redeveloped to offer features such as a swimming pool and a go-cart track, as well as a walk-in area for customers without cars. Kirby's company also built and operated a motel facing the theatre. Kirby rapidly expanded Village Drive-In Pty Limited through the late 1950s, with the circuit opening in the Melbourne suburbs of Rowville and Essendon; Victorian regional areas of Hamilton, Wangaratta and Stawell; and regional Tasmania in Launceston. Village also went into its first partnership with Greater Union to build a Geelong drive-in, and by the beginning of the 1960s, operated 27 drive-in theatres throughout the states of Victoria and Tasmania. Village Drive-In Pty Limited then began to expand throughout the rest of Australia, particularly after the company began adding so-called \\"hard-top\\" (enclosed) cinemas in the 1960s. While drive-ins catered to Australia's suburban and vast regional markets, the hard-top theatres targeted the country's growing inner-city areas where their populations were less reliant on private automobile ownership. Joining Roc Kirby in the company's expansion were his sons, Robert and John, who helped out by serving popcorn and soft drinks, and Graham Burke, who commenced with the company in 1960 sweeping floors at one of its theatres. Burke later became integral to the business, joining the Kirbys in Village Roadshow's expansion beyond exhibition. In 1967, the company entered the film distribution side, founding Roadshow Distributors. That operation later grew into Australia's largest, while also adding film production to its portfolio during the 1970s. The advent of home video in the late-1970s, however, spelled the end of the drive- in theatres. Although Village Roadshow continued to operate a number of drive- ins until the 1990s, the format itself faded quickly with the growing availability of videocassettes and VCRs (the original Croydon drive-in closed in 1990). However, Village Coburg Drive-In, within the inner-Melbourne suburb of Coburg North, survived this period and is the last drive-in still operated by Village to this day. However, Village Roadshow responded to these new trends, adding its own video distribution and video rental operations in 1985. Village Roadshow responded to another expanding trend, that of the multiplex cinema in the 1980s and '90s. Multiplexes were a reaction by the movie exhibition industry to the rise of video; the multiplex offered a choice of screenings in a single building, some containing up to 20 screens. Village Roadshow became a pioneer in building and converting its existing single or 'twin' screen cinemas into the multiplex concept, investing in new sound and projection technologies and introducing new features, such as stadium-style seating. By this change in business operations, Village Roadshow and their competitor cinema operators were able to attract audiences back into their theatres and were the forerunners to the multiplexes of today. Warner Village Cinema in Leicester Square, in the West End of London, United Kingdom. These cinemas operated from 1996 until 2004, and are now part of the Vue network of multiplexes. In 1988, Village Roadshow sold two-thirds in Village Cinemas and entered into an equal joint-venture partnership with Warner Bros. and Greater Union to develop a new chain of multiplex cinemas throughout Australia. The partnership, called the Australian Multiplex Joint Venture, grew quickly through the 1990s, establishing a chain of nearly 30 theatres with nearly 320 screens. The first joint-venture multiplex opened in Melbourne's Airport West as 'Village Greater Union 8' in 1989. In 1995, Village Roadshow added a new retail format from the creation of joint-venture, Village Nine Leisure, with Publishing & Broadcasting Limited and Westfield Holdings, to open a string of 'virtual entertainment' shops known as, Intencity. These video arcades expanded to most states and territories throughout Australia, usually co-locating with most Village Cinema sites in Victoria and Tasmania, and Greater Union/Birch Carroll & Coyle sites in other states (replacing some rival Timezone video arcade locations). Village Roadshow wholly acquired the chain in 1999, and since 2005, rationalised most locations down to the current nine arcades. With the company being led by John and Robert Kirby (who alternated in the chairman's position) and Graham Burke, who undertook the managing director's position, Village Roadshow began expanding its cinemas overseas in the 1990s. This saw New Zealand (Village Force and Village Rialto) became the company's first foreign market in 1991 after it established its first cinema in Manukau (the original Village Force cinema closed in late-2008 to open a new Skycity Cinema in Westfield Manukau City, now an Event Cinema). In 1992, the company entered Singapore with Hong Kong-based joint-venture partner, Golden Harvest, to form the Golden Village chain. Golden Village's success in Singapore further fuelled its international expansion in the mid-90s. In 1994, the company entered Thailand (Entertain Golden Village and Mongkol Golden Harvest), followed by Malaysia (Tanjong Golden Village and Golden Screen Cinemas) in 1995. By 1996, the company was actively expanding its cinema circuit in 20 different markets, including Hong Kong (Golden Village), joining with Orange Sky Golden Harvest again. In Europe, the company's purchase of half ownership in Warner International Theatres gave it a stake in 135 screens within the United Kingdom and 17 more in Germany, forming Warner Village Cinemas. By the end of 1996, the company had entered Fiji (Damodar Village Cinemas), Hungary (Hollywood Cinemas), and Argentina (Village Cines) as well. Also in 1996, Village Roadshow turned to its shareholders to fund further international expansion, raising $A216 million. The company added a number of new foreign markets, including Greece (Village Cinemas), Italy (Warner Village Cinemas), and India in 1997 (the Indian operations were a 60/40 joint-venture with local firm, Priya Exhibitors Private Limited to form PVR Cinemas ‚Äì Priya Village Roadshow Limited). In 1998, it also moved into Taiwan (Golden Village), South Korea (CJ Golden Village), and France (Village Cinemas). In February 1997, Village Cinemas and Warner Bros. partnered again to open Australia's first 24-hour cinema in Melbourne's new Crown Casino complex when it also opened (it reverted to normal cinema hours in 2001). It also included another new type of cinema, four Gold Class auditoriums, a luxury cinema format. By July 1999, Gold Class had already expanded to three auditoriums in Village Cinemas at Southland Shopping Centre; two at Century City Walk; three at Sunshine Marketplace; and one at The Jam Factory. Also by that time, the concept broadened to Birch Carroll & Coyle sites in Brisbane; with two screens at Indooroopilly Shopping Centre; and another two at Garden City. In October 1998, the Cinema Europa concept was introduced when three auditoriums were added to the Village Cinemas in The Jam Factory, closely followed by another three screens in Village Southland. As with Gold Class, this type of cinema would later be rolled out across other Village Cinemas in Melbourne before expanding overseas. PVR Cinema in Select Citywalk, Saket District Centre, within New Delhi. The establishment of this cinema in 1997 started the chain's Indian operations for Priya Exhibitors and Village Roadshow. The brand continues to trade after Village withdrew their involvement in 2002, with Gold Class and Cinema Europa screens held under licence (it operates IMAX instead of Vmax). In August 1999, it was announced that the Village Force and Village Rialto cinema chains in New Zealand (both being 50/50 joint ventures between Village Roadshow and NZ-based Force Corporation) would sell half their combined share in both multiplex networks to Hoyts to obtain half ownership in Hoyts' own NZ operations. Village Force, Village Rialto and Hoyts remained separate brands (similar to the Australian arrangements between joint venture partners, Village Cinemas and Greater Union/Birch Carroll & Coyle), yet merged back- office operations and marketing, leaving half-a-dozen staff redundant. The ownership structure saw Village Roadshow and Force Corporation keep 25% each, with Hoyts holding the remaining 50%. It was estimated by some business analysts that the combined group controlled more than two-thirds of all box office sales in New Zealand which concerned the Commerce Commission. However, after months of negotiations and legal threats from the Commission, Village Force and Hoyts jointly announced in September 2000 that they would unwind the new partnership going back to their original ownership structures. Both companies said the courts would have upheld the alliance in the end, but conceded the costs and time required in legal actions meant it was not worth battling the Commerce Commission over the issue. Village Force chief executive, Joe Moodabe told The New Zealand Herald, \\"there were so many uncertainties and frustrations and the cost as well, it's just time to say, 'We gave it a good shot and let's put it behind us.\\" He added that, \\"everybody's fed up with the whole thing now and wants to get on with life.\\" This left Hoyts NZ to find another head office location, while Force Corporation would later be subject to an acquisition by Skycity Entertainment Group in March 2001, resulting in the cinema chain being renamed to Village Skycity. Yet, the international market remained the company's clear priority as growth opportunities within its home market remained limited. Graham Burke told the Herald Sun, \\"We will be a worldwide entertainment giant ‚Äì if we are not already ‚Äì in five years.\\" By the end of 2000, the Village Cinemas brand had entered a number of new foreign markets, including Austria, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic. In early 2001, Village Roadshow's swift international cinema expansion had not convinced investors, and amid falling profits and a floundering share price, the public company was forced to abandon its ambition of establishing a global cinema empire. The company began exiting a number of foreign markets, with plans to drop back to just ten of its more profitable country markets. Village Roadshow also began shedding a number of its other non-core operations at the time while giving greater focus to its film distribution and production arms which included more major co-productions with Warner Bros. In late 2001, the company continued its international rationalisation, selling off its Swiss and Hungarian theatres. Germany and France followed, and, by the end of 2002, the company had sold off its cinema businesses in Malaysia, India, and Thailand as well. Not all the company's cinema businesses were in regression, however, as the company added extra theatres to its existing chains in the Czech Republic, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom that year. In early 2003, Burke and the Kirby brothers admitted that they saw Village Roadshow's future chiefly in film production, particularly given the seemingly saturated status of the exhibition market. That year, Warner Bros. sold their 33.3% share in the Australian Multiplex Joint Venture back to Village Roadshow and Amalgamated Holdings Limited who increased their stakes to 50/50, forming Australian Theatres, the overall owner of Village Cinemas and Greater Union/Birch Carroll & Coyle (Event Cinemas would be later introduced outside Village's Vic/Tas markets in 2009). Andƒõl, Prague, the capitol of the Czech Republic. These cinemas operated from 1999 until 2009, and are now part of the CineStar network of multiplexes. In November 2005, Village Roadshow and their New Zealand cinema partner Skycity Entertainment Group, sold their 50/50 joint venture in Argentina's 6 theatre, 69 screen, Village Cines chain to two US-based investment funds, Southern Screens Entertainment II and Blue Ridge at 78% and 22% respectively. The Village brand and concepts were also acquired under licence with plans to open a nine-screen cinema the next month in Caballito, Buenos Aires continued under the new owners. At the time, Hoyts was the leading Argentine exhibitor, with a 29% market share. In 2007, Village Roadshow sold its Warner Village Cinema operations in Italy, its two cinemas in Austria, and disposed of its 25% interest in the Palace Cinemas circuit in Australia. In New Zealand and Fiji, the company sold its 50% holding in Village Skycity Cinemas, the arthouse Village Rialto chain, and Damodar Village Cinemas to Skycity Entertainment Group. This left Skycity with 100% control over the NZ Village Skycity circuit (promptly renaming the chain, Skycity Cinemas), 50% partners in Village Rialto with Rialto Distribution (renaming them Rialto Cinemas), and 50% partners with the Fijian Damodar Brothers in the Damodar Village Cinemas chain (retaining the half Village branding) ‚Äì it lasted until January 2010 when Skycity divested all their exhibition interests to Village's Australian cinema partner, Amalgamated Holdings Limited. However, also in 2007, the company undertook a cinema refurbishment program in Greece, transitioning the chain from its original old style cinema designs to the new 'Village World' concept that included the debut of Vmax and Gold Class screens, in addition to caf√©s, bowling alleys and movie merchandise stores. In October 2008, the company entered the United States exhibition market by opening the first Village Roadshow Gold Class cinema in the wealthy Chicago suburb of South Barrington, followed by a second at Redmond, Washington. Local joint venture partners, Crescent Entertainment and the Alabama Pension Fund, owned a combined 40% stake in the new business with Village owning the majority. The company signed up a total of 12 sites across the US, all in up-market shopping areas, including New York City and Seattle, with plans to grow to about 40 complexes within three to five years. Like Gold Class cinemas in other countries, the US chain was targeting affluent movie goers willing to pay $US35 ($A43) a ticket for bigger chairs and the chance to order alcohol and gourmet food with their film. The only difference with the American chain saw its Gold Class screens located as stand-alone cinemas, while other international markets have theirs form part of the actual Village Cinema multiplexes. managing director, Graham Burke, commented on luxury movie watching as a new concept for America, \\"we will be the first mover in that market.\\" Yet, he added a reassurance for shareholders, \\"Australia is the 51st state, the culture is very similar and it's worked so well in Australia.\\" Village Roadshow Gold Class was headquartered in Burbank, California and led by CEO, Kirk Senior. In October 2009, local diversified investment holding company, Demco Group, acquired 100% of Village Roadshow's Greek operations including all seven Village Cinema multiplexes, in addition to the film production and distribution arms, under licence. In June 2012, Demco expanded the Village brand further by establishing a Pay TV movie channel in Greece called, Village Cinema, on the OTE TV platform. The year before, Demco announced they were establishing the first Village Cinema within Romania, in Ia»ôi's new Palas Mall. The 10-screen multiplex (including one Vmax screen) was slated for a September 2012 opening, however (as of October 2013), obtaining information on its current operations have been unsuccessful thus far. In September 2010, the company sold its majority stake in the six-theatre Village Roadshow Gold Class Cinemas LLC (Gold Class USA) to iPic Entertainment's new subsidiary, iPic-Gold Class Entertainment LLC, with Village retaining a 30% interest. Village Roadshow released a statement, admitting to shareholders; \\"The financial performance of the Gold Class USA cinemas has been disappointing from the outset.\\" Over the next year, the new owners rebranded the chain to iPic Theaters, reduced ticket prices, added extra seating, outsourced restaurant services, and added extra locations while closing others. In February 2013, all four Tasmanian Village Cinemas joined Australian Theatres after the long-standing joint venture between Village Roadshow and WIN Corporation ceased when WIN sold out. WIN's 50% investment was a legacy involvement from the mid-1980s, carried over from former Launceston-based media company, ENT Limited, which initially bought the stake (WIN acquired ENT in 1995). In June 2017, Village Roadshow's 50% stake in Golden Village was set to be acquired by Singapore-based media mini- conglomerate MM2 Asia. However, mm2's bid to acquire 50% of Golden Village cinema chain fell through as Village Roadshow failed to secure the approval of Golden Screen (also known as Orange Sky Golden Harvest), the other joint venture partner. Instead, in October 2017, Orange Sky Golden Harvest purchased the Village Roadshow's 50% stake, therefore having full ownership of Golden Village. It is unknown whether the Village name will be dropped from Golden Village as a result of the acquisition. The chain was forced to temporarily close all cinemas across the country in early 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but is set to reopen at the end of June.

Each Europa location features separate toilets and a licensed lounge bar and caf√©. Some Europa auditoriums are upholstered in blue, as opposed to red in the regular/traditional auditoriums. Village Cinemas' Albury affiliate, Regent Cinemas, operates a similar brand called, Showcase Cinema which is also upholstered in blue. However, since 2010, Village has scaled back the Cinema Europa brand and stopped staffing and promoting the screens at Jam Factory, Doncaster and Karingal although some of these locations are still screening Europa-type films. In Melbourne, Rivoli Cinemas is used by Village as the main outlet for films with very limited screenings such as, Frances Ha and The Turning. In Hobart, the regular Village Cinema at Eastlands is occasionally used this way ‚Äì it was the only cinema in Tasmania to screen Spring Breakers and Thanks for Sharing.

Sound is available via FM stereo broadcast. A retro 1950s style diner is also on site, which offers an SMS ordering service, which delivers food and drinks to your car. =Digital 3D= In early 2011 Village Cinemas Australia converted all of their auditoriums and cinemas to Digital Projectors, seeing traditional film and prints become extinct. The installation of these projectors means that all auditoriums are now RealD Cinema 3D capable. Initially the price of the 3D glasses required to watch films in 3D were included in the ticket price, however this has recently changed and the $1 cost of the glasses is being changed separately, making it cheaper for guests as it encourages people to keep and re-use their glasses for future sessions. VPremium There are VPremium auditoriums at the following sites: * Hobart (2 auditoriums) * Jam Factory * Southland  4DX  On 27 October 2017, the first 4DX screen owned by Village was opened. 4DX allows a motion picture presentation to be augmented with environmental effects such as seat motion, wind, rain, fog, lights, and scents along with the standard video and audio. As such, theaters must be specially designed for and equipped with 4DX technology. There are 4DX screens at the following sites: * Century City  Partnerships  In April 2015, BMW Australia and Village Gold Class Cinemas, in joint venture with AHL, announced a partnership where BMW Australia was named as the presenting partner for Village Gold Class Cinemas.

It was founded as an opposition to the New Left generation of the 1960s. Its intellectually oriented proponents distance themselves from Old Right Nazi traditions and emphasize similarities between the far-right and the conservative spectrum. A common denominator of the Neue Rechte is a skeptical or negative stance towards the basic tenets of the German constitution, often in the sense of an ethnic (v√∂lkisch) nationalism. History When in 1964 the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) was founded, its younger members began to call themselves Junge Rechte, in order to differ from Nazi models and to counter the German student movement. Contrary to their hopes, the NPD failed to enter the Bundestag parliament in the 1969 federal elections, whereafter they initiated a far-right renewal movement. In 1972, Henning Eichberg drafted the policy declaration of the Aktion Neue Rechte offshoot, conveying ideas of an 'anti-imperialistic liberation nationalism', which included the expulsion of the Allied 'occupying forces' to pave the way for German unification and national rebirth. From 1974, the movement disintegrated into numerous splinter groups, some defending the traditional ideas of a German Volksgemeinschaft, some affiliating to the rising ecology movement. Eichberg and his followers continued to fight an 'over- foreignization' (√úberfremdung) by the superpowers and advocated a Third Position in opposition to both capitalism and communism. They made attempts to build up ties to left-wing sectarian and ecological groups, as well as to the German peace movement. About 1980, a new tendency arose to approach the ideas of the French Nouvelle Droite and its founder Alain de Benoist. The adherents stressed the perspective of a pan-European 'cultural struggle'; their concepts were embodied by the foundation of the Thule-Seminar as the German branch of the French Groupement de recherche et d'√©tudes pour la civilisation europ√©enne (GRECE). In the late 1980s, proponents of a national revolutionary movement attempted to infiltrate right-wing populist parties like The Republicans, while other associated with the national liberal spectrum. The movement gained a new momentum in the course of German reunification. The rise of right-wing parties as The Republicans led by Franz Sch√∂nhuber, the Pro Movement, and recently the Alternative for Germany (AfD) is a matter of ongoing debate among German political scientists. They draw parallels to the success of European parties such as the Italian Alleanza Nazionale and the Lega Nord, the Freedom Party of Austria (FP√ñ), the French Front National, the Swiss People's Party (SVP) or the Belgian Vlaams Belang as well as to the US Tea Party movement. The programmatic statements of 'New Right' parties span from neoliberal to far-right elements and thereby have become compatible to conservative and liberal circles. Ideology Historically, the Neue Rechte is linked to the positions of right-wing ideologues in the Weimar Republic, later summarized under the heading 'Conservative Revolution' by apologists like Armin Mohler. These forces included such people as Arthur Moeller van den Bruck (Das Dritte Reich), Carl Schmitt, Edgar Julius Jung, Ernst J√ºnger, Oswald Spengler (The Decline of the West) and Ernst von Salomon. During the interwar period, they openly rejected Marxism as well as liberalism and the parliamentary system in favour of an authoritarian regime and a German Sonderweg. Their views towards rising Nazism remained ambivalent, nevertheless they contributed to the fierce political infighting that preceded the Nazi seizure of power in 1933. Several members of the Neue Rechte also refer to theorists like Georges Sorel, Vilfredo Pareto, Robert Michels, Julius Evola, and Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera seen as fascist pioneers. Some even base themselves on Marxist philosophers like Antonio Gramsci and his ideas of cultural hegemony. Textually, the Neue Rechte challenges the principles of the Enlightenment, such as pluralism and social equality underlying the doctrine of human rights. Racist elements are superseded by the concept of ethnopluralism, combining both neoconservative and far-right approaches. Ideologists disparage the ideals of the 1968 protests and feminism, they refuse to accept a multicultural society and seek for a strengthened 'national identity'. Therefore, they tend to historical revisionism and to battle against what they call a German 'cult of guilt' with regard to The Holocaust. According to Roger Griffin, the Neue Rechte share the deep cultural pessimism of their precursors in the interwar period. Referring to a v√∂lkisch nationalism, the movement seeks refuge not in the restoration of traditional values, but in a 'national rebirth' according to palingenetic concepts.\\"Der umstrittene Begriff des Faschismus. Interview in: DISS-Journal 13, 2004, p. 13 . They parallel the French Nouvelle Droite as a political movement, somewhat similar in their general political stance including the Anti-American sentiment advocated by Alain de Benoist. However, the Nouvelle Droite's neo-pagan leanings are the opposite to the Christian foundation of many Neue Rechte members, though the movement also comprises occult groups. So far, the Neue Rechte movement has not achieved an integrated opposite position to Western liberalism: while a main neoconservative tendency strongly refers to pre-war traditions and even affect centre-right parties, a second wing openly uses terms like \\"revolution\\" or \\"socialism\\" in political disputes, based on the model of Ernst Niekisch and Strasserist concepts. They have made attempts to build up a Querfront strategy with originally 'left' anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist circles. Networks Well-known scholars and influential figures of the Neue Rechte beside Henning Eichberg and Armin Mohler include Gerd-Klaus Kaltenbrunner, Hans-Dietrich Sander, Robert Hepp, Caspar von Schrenck-Notzing, Karlheinz Weissmann and G√∂tz Kubitschek. The medium commonly associated with the Neue Rechte is the weekly newspaper Junge Freiheit founded in 1986. However, its chief editor Dieter Stein, a former member of The Republicans, denounces the term and instead advocates a more traditionally Christian, yet decidedly nationalist and democratic conservatism. Yet the term is frequently used as a self-description by the bi-monthly magazine Sezession, which is closely linked to Junge Freiheit. Other periodicals affiliated with the Neue Rechte are Nation und Europa (discontinued in 2009) and its Zuerst! successor. The Studienzentrum Weikersheim founded by the CDU politician Hans Filbinger considers itself a Christian-conservative think tank. The Bibliothek des Konservatismus (BdK) is another connecting element in the network of the far- right in central Europe. Opened in 2012 and located in Fasanenstra√üe in Berlin-Charlottenburg the main focus of the library is conservative and far- right literature. It is the first library with this content in Germany and was founded by Caspar von Schrenck-Notzing and his foundation F√∂rderstiftung konservative Bildung und Forschung (FKBF). FKBF is running the library. There are 27.000 medias (2014) in the library.

The story concerns an eccentric old man, who lives alone with only his dog for company, and his discovery and treatment of a friend's deceased body. Plot summary The sketch begins with old man preparing dinner for himself and his beloved dog, Five Bob. Dinner consumed, the man gathers a pick and shovel and travels to a \\"blackfellow's grave about which he was curious.\\" He digs up the bones, places them in a bag, and starts for home. He discovers the body of a man, parched by the intense Australian sun. After close examination, the deceased man is determined to be a friend of the old man, an alcoholic named Brummy. The old man, somewhat ingeniously, devises a way of carrying Brummy back home, but he is startled by numerous large, greasy black goannas. He wonders why the peculiar lizards are so abundant today. He only discovers later, when he shoots one near the house, that they are attracted to Brummy's body. When the old man returns to his home, he decides that Brummy deserves a respectful funeral. He buries his friend, and decides that something must be said. He is unsure of Brummy's religion, or if he even has a religion at all, but the old man does his best.

It is not known who invented the term. The British politician David Miliband used it when he was appointed Secretary of State for the Environment in May 2006, both in his blog, and in an article on the BBC News website. He initiated the launch of a wiki, to form an environmental contract. However, the site was edited heavily by Government officials, rendering pointless the exercise to interact with the public. The term can be seen as an invitation to invite parallels with the idea of a social contract between workers, employers and the state which underpinned the foundation of the welfare state. Some have argued that, just as the social contract was a way of addressing social dislocation, so the environmental contract can be a way of addressing the environmental impacts which pose a threat to people and the planet in the 21st century.  Environmental citizenship  Environmental citizenship (EC) is defined as the responsible pro-environmental behavior of citizens who act and participate in society as agents of change in the private and public sphere, on a local, national and global scale, through individual and collective actions, in the direction of solving contemporary environmental problems, preventing the creation of new environmental problems, achieving sustainability as well as developing a healthy relationship with nature. Environmental citizenship includes the exercise of environmental rights and duties, as well as the identification of the underlying structural causes of environmental degradation and environmental problems, the development of the willingness and the competences for critical and active engagement and civic participation to address those structural causes, acting individually and collectively within democratic means, and taking into account inter- and intra-generational justice. Environmental citizenship is a key factor in EU's growth strategy (Europe 2020) and its vision for Sustainable Development, Green and Cycle economy and Low-carbon society (EU-roadmap 2050). Because of its emphasis on rights and responsibilities, there are clear links between the environmental contract and notions of environmental citizenship. EC may shed light on the research of environmental contract into the way publics are built in everyday settings, if it is built firmly around the notions of justice, knowledge and language.  Criticism  = Sustainability justifiable in its own right = The idea can seem to boil down to a sort of 'I will if You will' type of idea. But action for sustainability, such as having regard for the needs of future generations (including addressing environmental impacts) is arguably justifiable in its own right. Similarly, if there is the view that action on climate change, for example, is urgent and imperative, then an 'I will, irrespective of what you do' approach might be argued as more responsible. = Further criticism = Some of the criticism of the idea of social contract would also seem to apply here.

Early literature =Kojiki= The Kojiki is Japan's oldest extant book. Compiled in 712 AD, it contains passages about Yamato Takeru, the son of the emperor Keiko. It includes references to the use and admiration of the sword by Japanese warriors: :The many-clouds-rising :Izumo Takeru :Wears a Sword :With many vines wrapped around it, :But no blade inside, alas. or this: :Next to the maiden's :Sleeping place :I left :The sabre, the sword ‚Äî :Alas, that sword. Yamato Takeru may be considered the rough ideal of the Japanese warrior to come. Most important, his portrayal in the Kojiki shows the ideal of harmonizing the literary with the martial may have been an early trait of Japanese civilization, appealing to the Japanese long before its introduction from Confucian China. =Shoku Nihongi= The Shoku Nihongi (797 AD) is an early history of Japan compiled in 797. A section of the book covering the year 723 is notable for an early use of the term \\"bushi\\" in Japanese literature and a reference to the educated warrior-poet ideal: :\\"Again, the August Personage said, \\"Literary men and warriors are they whom the nation values.\\" In the Kokin Wakash≈´ (905) there is an early reference to \\"Saburau\\"‚Äîoriginally a verb meaning \\"to wait upon or accompany a person in the upper ranks of society.\\" The term would come to mean \\"those who serve in close attendance to the nobility.\\" From the mid-Heian Period these attendants were armed and served as guardians to the higher nobility. :Attendant to nobility :Ask for your master's umbrella. :The dews neath the trees of Miyagino :Are thicker than rain. : (Poem #1091) By the end of the 12th century, samurai became synonymous with bushi almost entirely and the word was closely associated with the middle and upper echelons of the warrior class. Literature of the 13th to 16th centuries =Heike Monogatari= Written in 1371, The Heike Monogatari chronicles the struggle between the Minamoto and Taira clans for control of Japan at the end of the 12th century, a conflict known as the Genpei War. The Heike Monogatari is one of the longest and most beautifully composed of the genre called gunki monogatari, or war chronicles. Clearly depicted throughout the Heike Monogatari is the ideal of the cultivated warrior. This ideal is symbolized in the character Êñå or uruwashii, meaning a situation of balance and harmony between the exterior pattern, or beauty (Êñá), and the interior essence, or substance (Ê≠¶). Men who possess this quality will be as accomplished in the world of the arts as in the world of martial skill and courage. One such example is Taira no Tadanori: :Friends and foes alike wet their sleeves with tears and said, :\\"What a pity! Tadanori was a great general, : pre-eminent in the arts of both sword and poetry.\\" : (Kitagawa and Tsuchida, 1975) The warriors in the Heike Monogatari served as models for the educated warriors of later generations, and the ideals depicted by them were not assumed to be beyond reach. Rather, these ideals were vigorously pursued in the upper echelons of warrior society and recommended as the proper form of the Japanese man of arms. With the Heike Monogatari, the image of the Japanese warrior in literature came to its full maturity. (Wilson, 1982) =The Message Of Master Gokurakuji= In the year 1256, the Shogunal Deputy in Kyoto, H≈çj≈ç Shigetoki (1198-1261) wrote a letter to his son and house elders of his clan. The letter, now known as \\"The Message Of Master Gokurakuji\\", emphasized the importance of loyalty to one's master: :When one is serving officially or in the master's court, he should not think of a hundred or a thousand people, but should consider only the importance of the master. Nor should he draw the line at his own life or anything else he considers valuable. Even if the master is being phlegmatic and one goes unrecognized, he should know that he will surely have the divine protection of the gods and Buddhas ... One should rely on neither age nor youth. But he who reveres the master and protects the people may be called a sage. :If one treats men roughly in this existence, he will be roughly treated by them in the next, for karma is never-ending in all things. And if one would rid himself of bad karma in this round of existence, he should treat well those who are not so kind to him. For if one is dealt with kindly by people, he can rejoice in his previous existence; but if he is handled roughly in this world, his previous existence is a matter for regret.\\" Written in kanamajiri style, \\"The Message Of Master Gokurakuji\\" is described as being \\"....basically concerned with man's moral duties and the ideal behavior for leaders of the warrior class. The predominant tone of the work is a Buddhist sympathy for all living beings and an awareness of the functions of karma. Women, children, and those of lower social standing are to be treated kindly and with regard, and even the concept of loyalty to superiors is dealt with more in a religious sense than a Confucian one.\\" =The Chikubash≈ç= The feudal lord Shiba Yoshimasa (1350 - 1410) wrote the Chikubash≈ç, a set of precepts for the young men of the Shiba clan. Chikubash≈ç translates literally as \\"The Bamboo Stilt Anthology\\". Shiba Yoshimasa was a warrior leader during the Namboku and Muromachi Periods, and was known as an administrator, general, and poet. The Chikubash≈ç consists of one volume and was completed in 1383. William Scott Wilson, author of Ideals of the Samurai describes the Chikubasho as \\"A short list of precepts written in a classical Japanese style, the Chikubasho displays both the ethical morality of the warrior and the tasteful lifestyle of the aristocracy. Its tone is a combination of a manly Confucian approach reflecting honesty and fairness, and a Buddhist sympathy for others.\\" In his writings, Shiba Yoshimasa dictated that a warrior should not hesitate to lay down his life for an important cause such as the defense of the emperor: :First, a man whose profession is the use of arms should think and then act upon not only his own fame, but also that of his descendants. He should not scandalize his name forever by holding his one and only life too dear. On the other hand, in the light of this, to consider this life that is given to us only once as nothing more than dust and ashes, and lose it at a time when one should not, would be to gain a reputation that is not worth mentioning. One's main purpose in throwing away his life is to do so either for the sake of the Emperor or in some great undertaking of a military general. =Imagawa Ry≈çshun (1325‚Äì1420)= Imagawa Ry≈çshun was a leading general and strategist of his time. His writings are central to the development of bushid≈ç and represent the \\"Way of the Warrior\\" at its maturity. Historian Carl Steenstrup describes Imagawa thusly: \\"He became one of the most influential literary critics of his time, a competent historian, and expert in the philosophy of government, and a prolific poet. In addition, he showed genuine talent for public administration, and gained military experience at an early age.\\" Imagawa wrote prolifically despite being posted to military hotspots by the sh≈çgun. His job was to suppress rebellion by rival samurai clans. Famed for his writings \\"Nan Taiheiki\\" and \\"Michiyukiburi\\", he penned \\"The Regulations\\" to his brother Tadaki in traditional kanbun script. Having taken Buddhist vows, Imagawa Ryoshun was greatly admired as having achieved the warrior ideal--striking a balance between the military and literary arts. According to Steenstrup, \\"The Letter soon became a historical force in its own right. First it became a textbook of ethics for the Imagawa clan, including its retainers. From the Imagawa, an appreciation of the text spread to other clans; as early as before the outbreak of the ≈ånin War, 1467, the Letter appears to have been used as an Office Manual for warrior bureaucrats even outside the Imagawa domains. When the Tokugawa established their hegemony in 1600, the Letter was already in use as a primer. The staff of Ieyasu included the text in the collection of the most important 'house-laws' which they compiled, probably for use as reference material in the drafting of the fundamental laws of the Tokugawa system which were issued in 1615.\\" Even after Japan's feudal era, they were a required study for traditional Japanese as a guide to proper moral behavior. Widely respected, \\"The Regulations\\" remained popular until World War II. =H≈çj≈ç Nagauji (1432‚Äì1519)= Near the beginning of the 16th century, the Samurai general H≈çj≈ç Nagauji (1432‚Äì1519) would write: :\\"Above all, believe in the gods and Buddhas. To worship the gods and Buddhas is the correct conduct for a man. It can be said that one will be in conformity with the feelings of the gods and Buddhas if he will simply make his heart straightforward and calm, respect honestly and wholeheartedly those above him and have pity on those below, consider that which exists to exist and that which does not exist to not exist, and recognize things just as they are. With such a frame of mind, one will have divine protection even though he does not pray. But if his mind is not straight, he had best be prudent lest it be said that he has been abandoned by Heaven, prayerful or not. :It is hardly necessary to record that both Learning and the military arts are the Way of the Warrior, for it is an ancient law that one should have Learning on the left and the martial arts on the right. But this is something that will not be obtainable if one has not prepared for it beforehand.\\" H≈çj≈ç concluded his list of precepts by stating: \\"To be a samurai is to be polite at all times\\". Also known as H≈çj≈ç , Lord H≈çj≈ç was greatly admired by other daimy≈çs as a good general and administrator. In addition to attracting more samurai to Odawara, he cut crop taxes from one- half to two-fifths of the harvest, and generally looked out for the welfare of his people. H≈çj≈ç's Twenty-One Precepts were written some time after H≈çj≈ç had become a priest, and reflect the fullness of his own experiences. The articles are basically rules for the daily life of the common warrior, and show his familiarity and sympathy for those in the lower echelons. The subject matter ranges from encouraging the study of poetry and horsemanship and the avoidance of games like chess and go, to advice on how to keep one's house in better order and well-protected. There is a strong tone of self-reliance throughout, reflecting H≈çj≈ç 's unsparingly meticulous character and his own rise to power. =Takeda Shingen (1521‚Äì1573)= The great Warlord Takeda Shingen (1521‚Äì1573) wrote in his house codes: :\\"Everyone knows that if a man doesn't hold filial piety toward his own parents he would also neglect his duties toward his lord. Such a neglect means a disloyalty toward humanity. Therefore such a man doesn't deserve to be called 'samurai'.\\" =Kat≈ç Kiyomasa (1562‚Äì1611)= Some famous sengoku daimy≈çs used the word Bushid≈ç in their writings. In a set of precepts addressed to \\"All samurai, regardless of rank\\" the feudal lord Kat≈ç Kiyomasa (1562‚Äì1611) orders his men to follow it: :If a man does not investigate into the matter of Bushid≈ç daily, it will be difficult for him to die a brave and manly death. Thus it is essential to engrave this business of the warrior into one's mind well ... One should put forth great effort in matters of learning. One should read books concerning military matters, and direct his attention exclusively to the virtues of loyalty and filial piety ... Having been born into the house of a warrior, one's intentions should be to grasp the long and the short swords and to die. Kat≈ç Kiyomasa was one of the most ferocious Samurai who ever lived. The son of a blacksmith, he joined Toyotomi Hideyoshi at age 18 and became legendary for his ferocity in combat, distinguishing himself at the battle of Shizugatake. A senior general, he was awarded lordship of Kumamoto castle in Higo at the age of 26. Awarded a large fief of 250,000 koku in Higo province, Kat≈ç ruthlessly suppressed Christianity. A follower of Nichiren Buddhism, he soon came into conflict with the lord of a neighboring province, a Christian named Konishi Yukinaga. In 1592, Kato Kiyomasa led part of Hideyoshi's army in his campaigns in Korea‚Äîalongside his rival, the daimy≈ç Konishi. He occupied the city of Seoul and later crossed the Tumen River into China. Historian Stephen Turnbull describes the horror and destruction of the Korean Invasions in several of his books as seen through the eyes of the Priest Keinen who accompanied the samurai during the campaign.[De Bary, W., Keene, Donald, Tanabe, George, Gluck, Carol, Tiedemann, Arthur, & Tsunoda, Ryusaku. (2001). Sources of Japanese Tradition, From earliest times to 1600 (2.nd ed., Introduction to Asian Civilizations). New York: Columbia University Press. Page 467], Keinen did not travel to Korea until the second Invasion in 1597, and he was accompanying Lord Hish≈´, not Kat≈ç Kiyomasa. Keinen's diary \\"Korea Day by Day\\" was so controversial that it remained unpublished until 1965. Turnbull also described Kato Kiyomasa's motivation for attacking the Jurchens of Manchuria in 1592 was 'to show the savages the mettle of the Japanese'. Kato stood poised to conquer all of Asia, but a Korean naval blockade prevented him from receiving reinforcements and provisions necessary to support his 150,000-man army. In 1597, Kato again led Hideyoshi's forces in Korea. The second invasion did not proceed well for the Samurai, but Kat≈ç's reputation for valor only increased. Surrounded at Yolsan, the Samurai army held out against incredible odds. Konishi Yukinaga had run into fierce fighting and tried to negotiate a peace treaty with the Korean and Chinese forces surrounding him. Kat≈ç was infuriated by the surrender attempt and upon his return to Japan, he ravaged the Konishi family's neighboring domain in retaliation. Konishi was mercilessly executed in the aftermath of Sekigahara and his domain was awarded to Kato, bringing his total fiefdom to 540,000 koku. Known for hunting tigers for sport armed with only a spear, the Koreans greatly feared Kato Kiyomasa and called him \\"Kishokan\\"‚Äî\\"The Devil General\\". William Scott Wilson describes Kat≈ç Kiyomasa thus: \\"He was a military man first and last, outlawing even the recitation of poetry, putting the martial arts above all else. His precepts show the single-mindedness and Spartan attitudes of the man, (they) demonstrate emphatically that the warrior's first duty in the early 17th century was simply to \\"grasp the sword and die.\\" Contemporary accounts of Kat≈ç describe him as \\"awe-inspiring, yet not unfriendly, and a natural leader of men\\". =Nabeshima Naoshige (1538‚Äì1618)= In the late 16th century, the feudal lord Nabeshima Naoshige (1538‚Äì1618) would write a set of wall inscriptions for his followers. Historians describe the wall inscriptions as \\"Everyday wisdom, rather than house laws proper\\" Lord Nabeshima's written works also include a mention of bushid≈ç: :\\"Bushid≈ç is in being crazy to die. Fifty or more could not kill one such a man\\" In 1584, Nabeshima Naoshige was the chief retainer for the Lord of Hizen until he was killed in battle by the forces of the powerful Shimazu Clan. After his lord's death, Nabeshima became the true leader of the fiefdom and fought against the Shimazu again in 1587. A Sengoku-period warlord, Nabeshima distinguished himself in battle by killing hundreds of men. He was later sent on Hideyoshi's Korean campaigns where he struck up a friendship with Kato Kiyomasa and upon his return to Hizen, Tokugawa Ieyasu. At Sekigahara, Lord Nabeshima's son, Katsushige, was convinced to take sides against Tokugawa Ieyasu. Nabeshima wisely recalled him to attack Tokugawa's enemies in Ky≈´sh≈´, thus saving the clan from disaster. Historians describe Nabeshima as \\"a survivor and a man of quick intelligence\\" who saved his domain from invasion several times. His actions and sayings are immortalized in the third chapter of the Hagakure by writer Yamamoto Tsunetomo, a close attendant of Nabeshima Naoshige's grandson, Mitsushige. Literature of the 17th to 19th centuries =Torii Mototada (1539‚Äì1600)= The Last Statement of Torii Mototada outlines the justification, written to his son, for his decision to remain behind at Fushimi Castle. His decision to remain, even though vastly outnumbered, articulates clearly the beliefs that encapsulates Bushid≈ç philosophy. To serve, to be honourable, to be compassionate and in the end to die a glorious death in battle. :\\"But that is not the true meaning of being a warrior, and it would be difficult to account as loyalty. Rather, I will stand off the forces of the entire country here, and, without even one one-hundredth of the men necessary to do so, will throw up a defense and die a resplendent death. By doing so I will show that to abandon a castle that should be defended, or to value one's life so much as to avoid danger and to show the enemy one's weakness is not within the family traditions of my master Ieyasu.\\" and :\\"Be first of all prudent in your conduct and have correct manners, develop harmony between master and retainers, and have compassion on those beneath you. Be correct in the degree of rewards and punishments, and let there be no partiality in your degree of intimacy with your retainers. the foundation of man's duty as a man is in \\"truth\\". Beyond this, there is nothing to be said\\". =Kuroda Nagamasa (1568‚Äì1623)= In 1622, the daimy≈ç Kuroda Nagamasa (1568‚Äì1623) would emphasize the balance of the arts of peace (Confucian learning and literature) with the arts of war, and encourages fairness and sympathy toward the other three classes of people in his writings: :\\"If a general who is to maintain the province does not have a special consciousness, his task will be a difficult one to attain. His attitudes must not be the same as the ordinary man's. Firstly, he must be correct in manners and etiquette, must not let self-interest into government, and must take care of the common people ... he should not forget even for a moment that he is the model for the four classes of people. :Generally speaking, the master of a province should discharge his duties with love and humanity, should not listen to slander, and should exercise the good. His governing should be as clear as the bright sun in the bright sky, and he should think things over deeply in his mind and make no mistakes. :The arts of peace and the arts of war are like the two wheels of a cart which, lacking one, will have difficulty in standing ... When one has been born into the house of a military commander, he should not forget the arts of war even for a moment ... it is essential that he know the Way of Truth, that he be particular about his efforts in the scrutinizing of every matter, that he be just in all affairs and make no mistakes, that he be correct in recognizing good and evil and demonstrate rewards and punishments clearly, and that he have a deep sympathy for all people. Again, what is called cherishing the Way of the Warrior is not a matter of extolling the martial arts above all things and becoming a scaremonger. It is rather in being well-informed in military strategy, in forever pondering one's resources of pacifying disturbances, in training one's soldiers without remiss, in rewarding those who have done meritorious deeds and punishing those who have committed crimes, in being correct in one's evaluation of bravery and cowardice, and in not forgetting this matter of \\"the battle\\" even when the world is at peace. It is simply brashness to make a specialty of the martial arts and to be absorbed in one's individual efforts. Such is certainly not the Way of the Warrior of a provincial lord or military commander. Kuroda Nagamasa was the son of a Christian daimy≈ç, Kuroda Josui, and was baptized Simeon in 1583. He was to become well known as a great strategist. While still young, Kuroda was put under the auspices of Oda Nobunaga and later served under Toyotomi Hideyoshi. In 1592 and again in 1597 he shared command of the vanguard invasion troops in Korea with Konishi Yukinaga and Kat≈ç Kiyomasa. Although he had helped Konishi out of some military tight spots in Korea and was‚Äîlike Konishi‚Äîa Christian, Kuroda supported Tokugawa Ieyasu during the fighting at Sekigahara, and for his efforts was enfieffed at Chikuzen becoming Lord of Fukuoka Castle. Both Kuroda Nagamasa and his father Josui were well known for their regard for the advice of others, and Nagamasa even set aside one night a month when he would sit with a number of his trusted retainers and allow all to talk freely with the mutual promise that none would become angry over what was said, or gossip about it later. These were called the \\"Meetings Without Anger\\". The Regulations given here were written a year before Kuroda's death to his eldest son, Tadayuki. =Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645)= Go Rin No Sho (The Book of Five Rings) Unlike many other early writings, Miyamoto Musashi's Go Rin no Sho was written in Japanese, rather than the Chinese common in such works. It is also written in a simplistic, straightforward way which makes for somewhat clumsy literary work,The Book of Five Rings, Miyamoto Musashi, translated by Thomas Cleary, Shambhala Publications, 1993. its innate clarity has allowed it to be readily accessible to readers across the ages and across cultures. :It is said the warrior's is the twofold way of pen and sword, and he should have a taste for both ways. Even if a man has no natural ability he can be a warrior by sticking assiduously to both divisions of the Way. Generally speaking, the way of the warrior is resolute acceptance of death. :Know the smallest things and the biggest things, the shallowest things and the deepest things. As if it were a straight road mapped out on the ground ... These things cannot be explained in detail. From one thing, know ten thousand things. When you attain the Way of strategy there will not be one thing you cannot see. You must study hard. Dokkod≈ç (1645) He wrote his final work \\"Dokkod≈ç\\" (The Way of Walking Alone) in a cave called Reigand≈ç before passing away at the age of 60 in 1645. Musashi's last request was to be buried in full armor and bearing his sword, guarding the T≈çkaid≈ç road to Edo (present day Tokyo). =The 47 r≈çnin= In the 15th year of Genroku, the 47 r≈çnin of Ak≈ç cited Confucian edict as the reason for their famous vendetta. (As Translated by Algernon Bertram Freeman-Mitford (1837‚Äì1916), Lord Redesdale, British Ambassador to Japan in his book Tales of Old Japan.) :\\"...still we, who have eaten of your food, could not without blushing repeat the verse, 'Thou shalt not live under the same heaven nor tread the same earth with the enemy of thy father or lord,' nor could we have dared to leave hell and present ourselves before you in paradise, unless we had carried out the vengeance which you began.\\" The 47 R≈çnin were retainers of Lord Asano Takuminokami Naganori, daimy≈ç of Ak≈ç Castle. A man 35 years of age, his family was a branch of the powerful Asano Clan. Strict followers of Confucianism, the Asano Clan was a proud and traditional family. By the year 1700, Japan had been at peace for a hundred years, unified under the sword of Tokugawa Ieyasu. In the absence of warfare, society prospered and the samurai had become more like government bureaucrats. In the capital of Edo, they preoccupied themselves with literature, artwork and fine clothing. They had even begun to lose their fighting skills. The more traditional families like the Asano looked upon the city samurai with disdain. To prevent warfare, the shogunate's law of sankin-k≈çtai (alternate attendance) required all daimy≈çs to spend every other year in the capitol of Edo as hostages. While in Edo, Lord Asano was chosen to host a very important Imperial envoy during the holidays. Because he was from the countryside he wasn't accustomed to the manners required for such a fancy ceremony. The Tokugawa sh≈çguns master of ceremonies, Lord Kira Kozukenosuke was appointed to teach Asano the required etiquette. Although it was his job to do so, Lord Kira demanded a bribe of Asano. Asano refused to pay the bribe, offering only a token gift. Kira refused to teach Asano the correct manners and so he made embarrassing mistakes during the ceremony. Lord Kira began taunting Asano's mistakes and so Lord Asano lashed out with his short sword, injuring Kira. The drawing of a sword inside Edo castle was a capital offense and so Asano was ordered to commit seppuku. Asano's bodyguards rushed home with the bad news, covering more than 425 miles in five days. Asano's men later learned that Kira had survived the attack. A member of a powerful family, Kira had surveillance placed on Lord Asano's followers. The leaders of the Ak≈ç Domain met to discuss their options. \\"They discussed siege, capitulation, vengeance and self-immolation.\\" The Bakufu (military government) ordered that Asano's han (domain) be forfeit to the shogunate. \\"Oishi Kuranosuke decided on capitulation, and about 50 or so ageed with him.\\" The loss of reputation of their lord and the thought of life as r≈çnin was unbearable to the samurai of Ako. In a solemn and dramatic ceremony, the 322 retainers of Lord Asano secretly swore a blood oath to avenge their dead lord after the surveillance ended. (note: in Japanese, the word \\"r≈çnin\\" means \\"wave man\\", a person destined to wander aimlessly forever, like the waves in the sea. The word came to mean a samurai who was no longer in the service of a lord for some reason or another. It was considered undesirable to be a r≈çnin, because it meant being without a stipend from a lord, measured in koku of rice, a koku being equal to a roughly 180 liters/150 kg, enough rice to feed a man for one year.) The warriors of Ako disbursed as R≈çnin with Kira's spies watching their every move. They lay in wait for years before attacking. Spies carefully noted the layout of Kira's house. One man married the daughter of the architect who designed Kira's manor, in order to obtain copies of the floorplans. Some of the men divorced their wives and sent them back to their parents. The r≈çnin endured incredible humiliation. Because they walked in disgrace, they could not enter the service of another lord. Many of the men would even refuse to consider serving Lord Asano's brother, Asano Daigaku, stating \\"The brother of my lord is not my lord.\\" Some of the R≈çnin worked at non-warrior occupations and some even pretended to be drunks. Samurai from other provinces would happen upon the men laying drunk in the streets and ridicule their inaction. The drunken and unruly behavior of the Ak≈ç r≈çnin fooled the spies into lowering their guard after two years. On a dark and snowy December night (December 14, 1702), disguised as firemen, the 47 men attacked the fortress of Lord Kira. A member of a wealthy family, Kira was surrounded by an armed retinue of 60 samurai bodyguards. Using a giant sledge, the r≈çnin stormed the front and back gates at the same time. Archers were posted on the roof tops to kill any escaping samurai. Because no one liked him, none of Kira's neighbors or his nearby family came to his aid. (note: The 47 R≈çnin are always depicted wearing clothing with a zig-zag pattern on them meant to symbolize eternal fidelity, the faithfulness of night following day.) Lord Kira was captured and members of his clan were put to the sword. Kira was presented with the same knife which Lord Asano used for his seppuku. Instead of killing himself, he knelt trembling and Oishi was forced to behead him. The R≈çnin marched through the snow with Lord Kira's head in a firebucket. People along the path praised the men and offered them food. \\"The forty-six retainers without Terasaka Kichiemon arrived at the Sengakuji Temple at 10 o'clock. They placed Kira Kozukenosuke's severed head on the tomb of Asano Takuminokami.\\" Also placed on the tomb is the knife used by Lord Asano in his seppuku ritual. The same knife was used to kill lord Kira. The 46 men then prayed for the soul of Asano to rest in peace. Gathering all of the money they had left, the R≈çnin of Ako begged the Abbot of Sengaku-ji for a proper burial after death. Normally a stern and stoic man, it is said that he had tears in his eyes when he heard their final request. After a months long debate among legal scholars, the R≈çnin of Ako were condemned to hara-kiri. In the 1860s, Lord Redesdale lived in a house within sight of Sengaku-ji where the 47 R≈çnin were buried. Impressed by the loyalty displayed by the r≈çnin, he toured Sengaku-ji and finding tattered and yellowed letters amongst the relics, he translated them for his book \\"Tales of Old Japan.\\" Each of the r≈çnin carried letters spelling out their intentions in case they were captured or killed. Also translated were the receipt provided by the relatives of Lord Kira for the return of his severed head and the final statement placed by the men on Lord Asano's tomb before surrendering for court martial. Each of the men were aware of the seriousness of their actions. Onodera Junai would state in a letter to his wife in Kyoto: :\\"... Even if my dead body is shown, I think my duty will be fulfilled because my dead body will demonstrate Samurai loyalty to the entire country and it will strengthen their resolve.\\" In John Allyn's book, \\"The 47 Ronin Story\\", the leader of the 47 R≈çnin Oishi Kuranosuke is quoted as saying: :Some people live all their lives without knowing which path is right. They're buffeted by this wind or that and never really know where they're going. That's largely the fate of the commoners‚Äîthose who have no choice over their destiny. For those of us born as samurai, life is something else. We know the path of duty and we follow it without question. \\"Sengakuji Temple (Resting Place of the 47 Ronin)\\" *Uncommon Valor: On December 14, 2002, More than 130,000 people gathered at Sengaku-ji to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the attack on Lord Kira's Mansion by the warriors of Ako.

J. Cherryh's Alliance-Union universe to travel faster-than-light (FTL). Jump can also be a verb, and is the act of travelling FTL using jump technology. Development of FTL travel In 2220, Estelle Bok, a physicist investigating FTL travel, arrived at Cyteen Station with a group of immigrants. She continued her research there and achieved a major breakthrough in 2230 when she found a loophole allowing the Einsteinian limit to be breached. This enabled her to derive the Bok Equation, the theoretical basis for FTL travel. Cyteen management immediately initiated a program to apply Bok's principle to ship drives, and in 2248 the first FTL probe, Aurora, set out from Cyteen Station to Mariner Station, 6.8 light years away, and back. As news of the FTL technology spread, ships began arriving at Cyteen Station requesting FTL conversions. However, it was not until 2261 that Earth learned of these developments and attached top priority to acquiring the new technology. When the technology finally reached Pell Station in 2262, Earth began studying it, and launched its first FTL warship in 2266. Mechanics of jump In the Alliance-Union universe faster-than-light (FTL) ships have two major drive systems, slower-than-light (STL) thrusters and FTL jump engines. The jump engines comprise vanes that are attached to the outside of the ship. When the vanes are pulsed, they generate gravity waves which create a field, or \\"bubble\\", around the ship that pulls it (and anything else in the field) along the interface between realspace (Einsteinian space) and hyperspace (jumpspace). Jump takes place between two massive objects, called jump-points, which are generally stars, brown dwarves, or \\"rogue planets\\" sufficiently massive to make \\"pockmarks\\" in hyperspace. Prior to jumping, the ship's navigators calculate an outbound vector, targeting the destination jump-point with direction and speed. The ship accelerates along this vector with a long STL burn until it is clear of the current jump-point's gravity well. The jump engines are then engaged and the ship punctures the interface between realspace and enters jumpspace. Provided the proper heading was achieved prior to jump entry, the ship is drawn through jumpspace to the nearest gravity well on the outbound vector, the destination jump-point. Here it re-enters realspace, traveling at the same heading as it was before it entered the jumpspace, but at a velocity which is a large fraction of C (the speed of light).Cherryh, C.J. (1982) Merchanter's Luck p. 43 & 44. Back in normal space the ship dumps velocity by cycling its vanes to graze the interface, like casting an anchor hyperspace, before the STL thrusters take are used to slow the ship further at system-safe velocities. It is possible to pass through several jump-points without slowing down, but this is risky as it can cause the ship's velocity to become uncontrollable. Calculating the correct outbound vector prior to jumping is crucial, and the mass of the ship and its load have to be factored in. The more momentum the ship has in jumpspace, the closer to the destination jump-point it will re-appear. Too much momentum could result in it dropping into realspace too close to, or even inside, the destination mass. The ship can also \\"overshoot\\" the jump-point with too much momentum and will then drift through hyperspace until a sufficiently massive object is encountered which could drop it \\"anywhere\\" in realspace. Not enough momentum, or targeting an object not massive enough to pull the ship out of hyperspace will also leave the ship drifting. A ship's power-to-mass is significant, allowing an unloaded ship to travel faster in jumpspace than a loaded ship of similar design, even enabling the former to \\"over-jump\\" the latter. Warships have high power-to-mass ratios, making them fast despite their size. If another ship happens to be at your ship's re-entry point, both ships will be destroyed. In theory it is possible to jump \\"any\\" distance, but the practical limit is about ten light-years. Calculating trajectories beyond a certain distance become too unreliable because of the unpredictable nature of n-dimensional hyperspace. Over short distances the calculation discrepancies are negligible, but over longer distances, the errors multiply. In addition, there is the interference of nearby stars that are likely to alter the intended trajectory. Contrary to other \\"jump technologies\\", jump in the Alliance-Union universe is not instantaneous. However, just how long a ship actually spends in jumpspace is difficult to gauge because jump-time (also called \\"no-time\\") is not real-time. But sufficient time does elapse for minor injuries on \\"tranked\\" (tranquilized) crew's bodies to heal and for \\"night- walkers\\" to move about the ship. Typically subjective time aboard a ship in jumpspace can vary from a few days to several weeks. =Disappearances= If a ship fails to return to realspace, whether through pilot error, or some other failing, it remains in hyperspace, lost permanently. Only one of Cherryh's novels, Port Eternity (1982), deals with this, although it is unclear when in the Alliance-Union timeline it takes place, except that it is after the establishment of the Alliance and Union and occurs in Union-side space. =The Knnn= The technologically advanced and enigmatic methane-breathing Knnn from Cherryh's Compact space are the only known species that can change a ship's vector during jump. Knnn ships also have the ability to jump together in synchronisation, sometimes up to a dozen at a time. A single jump-field is created around all the ships and they are pulled into hyperspace as a unit. The Knnn sometimes use this ability to transport ships of other species through jumpspace. They cluster around an unsuspecting vessel, create a single jump-field and haul the ship with them. Effects of jump =Time dilation= One of the relativistic effects of jump is time dilation, that is, time slows down for objects in motion relative to those at rest, and the faster the object moves, the more pronounced the effect. Crew that spend much of their time aboard spaceships that jump frequently age slower than space station personnel and this gives rise to the notion of \\"ship-time\\" and \\"station-time\\" (or \\"Universal time\\"). A navigator on a merchant ship may be 30 years old ship-time, but considerably older in terms of station-time. To resolve this dilemma, a person's \\"true age\\" is calculated with medical computers using parameters such as what ships he or she has been on, what routes these ships took, and what load they carried. =Disorientation= Jump is a disorientating experience for those using it, although the degree of discomfort varies depending on the species. Most humans experience extreme psychological distress, potentially resulting in madness, and need to \\"trank down\\" or tranquilize themselves prior to each jump. The oxygen-breathing species native to Cherryh's Compact space, with the exception of the Stsho, do not require drugs during jump as their bodies naturally enter a deep sleep. However, some species in the Alliance-Union universe can function normally during jump and require little to no assistance (presumably the Knnn, since their ships can change course in mid-jump, but also the Kif, who keep this capability secret). For humans, the jump from realspace to hyperspace is perceived as the ship (and themselves) coming apart, and it became necessary to develop \\"trank-packs\\" that administer tranquilizers to the crews of FTL ships prior to jumping. Tranking down puts the crew into a quasi-sleep state for the duration of the jump, leaving them only marginally aware of their surroundings. \\"Nutri-packs\\" were also developed to provide essential sustenance for the crew upon waking after system re-entry, as jumps can sometimes last up to a few weeks of \\"no-time\\", leaving them extremely hungry, thirsty and nauseated. Ships with tranked crews are always at their most vulnerable when they drop back into realspace. The crew is groggy and slow reacting to the current status of their ship and the possible presence of other ships in the vicinity. =Night-walkers= A \\"night-walker\\" is someone from a species that normally sleep during jump (naturally or via trank) who have learnt to function normally while in jump-time. They embrace this alternate reality, with all its unworldly shapes and sounds, and believe there are new \\"worlds\\" to be found out there. New jump-points and routes are often discovered by night-walkers. Notable night-walkers in Cherryh's Alliance-Union universe include Chur Anify (hani) in Chanur's Homecoming (1986), Hallan Meras (hani) in Chanur's Legacy (1992), and Capella (human) in Tripoint (1994). Night-walkers who are also navigators, like Capella, are valued because they are awake on re-entry into realspace and can therefore react quicker than crew still recovering from trank. They can also sometimes \\"hear\\" potential problems while in hyperspace, for example the presence of an enemy ship. However, they can't navigate the ship, as their computers do not work in hyperspace. But aside from just listening, they sometimes amuse themselves by wandering around the ship and entering tranked crewmates' rooms.

The success of the revolution marked the beginning of the Sexenio Democr√°tico with the installment of a provisional government. Background An 1866 rebellion led by General Juan Prim and a revolt of the sergeants at San Gil barracks, in Madrid, sent a signal to Spanish liberals and republicans that there was serious unrest that could be harnessed if it were properly led. Liberals and republican exiles abroad made agreements at Ostend in 1866 and Brussels in 1867. These agreements laid the framework for a major uprising, this time not merely to replace the Prime Minister with a Liberal, but to overthrow Queen Isabella, whom Spanish liberals and republicans began to see as the source of Spain's difficulties. Her continual vacillation between liberal and conservative quarters had, by 1868, outraged the moderates, the progressives, and the members of the Uni√≥n Liberal. An opposition to her government had developed that crossed party lines. Leopoldo O'Donnell's death in 1867 caused the Uni√≥n Liberal to unravel; many of its supporters, who had crossed party lines to create the party initially, joined the growing movement to overthrow Isabella in favor of a more effective regime. Revolution Battle of Alcolea on 28 September 1868 In September 1868 naval forces under admiral Juan Bautista Topete mutinied in Cadiz. This was the same city where a half-century before, Rafael del Riego had launched his coup against Isabella's father. When the generals Prim and Francisco Serrano denounced the government, much of the army defected to the revolutionary generals on their arrival in Spain. The queen made a brief show of force at the Battle of Alcolea, where her loyal moderado generals under Manuel Pavia were defeated by General Serrano. In 1868 Queen Isabella crossed into France and retired from Spanish politics. She lived there in exile, at the Palacio Castilla in Paris, until her death in 1904.  Aftermath  General Juan Prim, an architect of the 1868 revolution against Queen Isabella II. The revolutionary spirit that had just overthrown the Spanish government lacked direction; the coalition of liberals, moderates, and republicans were faced with the incredible task of creating a government that would suit them better than had Isabella. Control of the government passed to Francisco Serrano, an architect of the revolution against Baldomero Espartero's dictatorship. The Cortes initially rejected the notion of a republic; Serrano was named regent while a search was launched for a suitable monarch to lead the country. In 1869, the Cortes wrote and promulgated a liberal constitution, the first such constitution in Spain since 1812. Queen Isabella II of Spain in exile in Paris. The search for a suitable king proved to be problematic for the Cortes. The republicans were mostly willing to accept a monarch if he was capable and abided by a constitution. Prim, a perennial rebel against the Isabelline governments, was named regent in 1869. The aged Espartero was brought up as an option, still having considerable sway among the progressives; even after he rejected the notion of being named king, he received eight votes for his coronation in the final tally. Many proposed Isabella's young son Alfonso (the future Alfonso XII of Spain), but others thought that he would be dominated by his mother and inherit her flaws. Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg, the former regent of neighboring Portugal, was sometimes mentioned as a possibility. Politicians feared that a nomination offered to Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen would trigger a Franco- Prussian War. Satiric depiction of the Carlists (1869) In August 1870, they selected an Italian prince, Amadeo of Savoy. The younger son of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, Amadeo had less of the troublesome political baggage that a German or French claimant would bring, and his liberal credentials were strong. He was elected King as Amadeo I of Spain on November 3, 1870. He landed in Cartagena on November 27, the same day that Juan Prim was assassinated while leaving the Cortes. Amadeo swore upon the general's corpse that he would uphold Spain's constitution. He lasted two years, after which the parties formed the first Spanish Republic. That in turn lasted two years. No political force was willing to restore Isabella; instead, in 1875 the Cortes proclaimed Isabella's son as King Alfonso XII.

According to an American obituary bridge column, he was known in Hungary as \\"the ultimate authority on Hungarian prose\\".  Biography  Ottlik was born and died in Budapest. He attended the military school at K≈ëszeg and Budapest, and studied mathematics and physics at Budapest University 1931‚Äì1935. After a brief career on Hungarian radio, he was a secretary of Hungarian PEN Club from 1945 to 1957. As he was unable to publish his works for political reasons, he earned his living translating. He translated mainly from English (Charles Dickens, George Bernard Shaw, John Osborne, Evelyn Waugh); and German (Thomas Mann, G. Keller, Stefan Zweig). He was a passionate bridge player and advanced theoretician. In a bridge column three months after Ottlik's death, Alan Truscott placed him \\"among the strongest candidates\\" for \\"the bridge writer with the greatest creativity in terms of card-play theory\\". His 1979 book Adventures in Card Play, written with Hugh Kelsey, introduced and developed many new concepts (such as Backwash squeeze and Entry-shifting squeeze).

Causes A number of liberal laws, advocated by Mouzinho da Silveira had come into effect in Portugal. These included the abolition of chapels with an income of less than 200,000 reais per year, the abolition of tax on the transfer of ownership in real estate, except for sale or exchange of lands in connection with church tithes and special jurisdictions; the suppression of the distilling and wine exporting privileges of the Companhia de Vinhos and the Alto Duero, and the establishment of a new judiciary structure, with new court circuits called \\"distritos de relacionamento\\". These reforms were significant changes aimed at putting into practice the principles of free trade and economic liberalism embraced by the government established under the Constitutional Charter of 1826. There reforms did not meet with the expected success. The sale of national property only benefited a limited group of the landed wealthy, which was enriched and added to its already extensive properties. Most people continued to live in poverty. The country‚Äôs economy continued to be highly dependent on the United Kingdom, particularly since the 1810 treaty that allowed preferential access to the Portuguese market for British goods. Portugal continued to lack manufacturing and remained backward in comparison with many other European countries. Another cause of discontent was the fact that the Constitutional Charter of 1826, granted by King Pedro IV, lacked legitimacy as it had not been passed by a constituent assembly. The Mutiny of La Granja de San Ildefonso in Spain against Queen Maria Christina in August 1836 gave Portuguese liberals further encouragement. The revolution The revolutionary movement started in Oporto, where radicals calling for the restoration of the Constitution of 1822 were returned in the general election of 17 July. The outgoing government of the Duke of Terceira won a clear majority (79 seats to 41 for the opposition), but when the opposition representatives from Oporto arrived in Lisbon on 9 September, various pamphlets and other publications had already circulated in the capital, spreading revolutionary ideas and attacking the government. For the most part, the people of the city welcomed the movement with open arms. As the representatives disembarked they were met by a giant crowd, shouting slogans in favour of the revolution and for the Constitution of 1822. Queen Maria II and the government had no means to fight the revolution, all the less since the National Guard has declared its loyalty to the movement, and relinquished power to its leaders, the Count of Linhares, S√° da Bandeira and Passos Manuel. None of these had taken a direct part in the revolution itself, but stood out as the most capable men among those who defended it. The revolution of 9 September was one of the few in Portuguese history that began with a popular civil society movement, which only later received support from the military.

Ascanius, son of Aretaon, should not be confused with Ascanius (son of Aeneas) or Ascanius (son of Priam), who also feature in legends of the Trojan War. In the 1920s, the region was known for rice production. In 2014, during aerial photography to survey the local monuments, the remains of an underwater Byzantine basilica -possibly erected in the 4th century- were identified, a discovery which was named one of the top 10 discoveries by the Archeological Institute of America. The basilica was dedicated to St. Neophytos of Nicaea and it is thought that the effects of an earthquake which took place in A.D. 740 provoked its collapse.

It was a division of Lord Kitchener's New Army volunteers, mostly \\"bantam\\" recruits of below regulation height. It was later briefly reformed as a fictional deception formation in the Second World War, and during the early years of the Cold War was recreated a third time to garrison Hong Kong. History = First World War = The 40th Division was originally formed as a Kitchener's Army 'Bantam' division between September and December 1915 for service in the First World War. 'Bantam' personnel were those who were under the Army regulation height but otherwise fit for service. It comprised the 119th, 120th, and 121st Brigades. The 40th Division moved to the Western Front in June 1916 and served there throughout the First World War. The most notable action of the division may be its participation in the Battle of Cambrai in late 1917. By 22 November the British were left exposed in a salient on the battlefield. Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front, wanted Bourlon Ridge and the exhausted 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division was replaced by the 40th Division, commanded by Major-General John Ponsonby, on 23 November. Supported by almost a hundred tanks and 430 guns, the 40th attacked into the woods of Bourlon Ridge on the morning of the 23rd. They made little progress. The Germans had put two divisions of Gruppe Arras on the ridge with another two in reserve and Gruppe Caudry was reinforced. The 40th Division reached the crest of the ridge but were held there and suffered over 4,000 casualties for their efforts in three days. The division was subsequently driven back in the German counterattacks, suffering many more losses.Whitton 1926, p.86-153 From July 1918 until March 1919, the division was led by General Sir William Peyton and took part in the Hundred Days advance through Flanders.

The route connects the former town of Basalt to the rest of Mineral County. A road has been in the place of SR 360 since 1919, and became State Route 10 by 1929. View from the south end of SR 360 looking northbound Route description State Route 360 begins near the border of the Inyo National Forest northeast of the California state line, at the site of the former town of Basalt on U.S. Route 6 (US 6). From there, the highway proceeds north for about before turning northeast to roughly parallel the Mineral‚ÄìEsmeralda county line. The route winds around some mountains and valleys, including following the southeast tip of the Excelsior Mountains. SR 360 reaches its terminus at U.S. Route 95 near the former town of Rhodes, south of Mina. History SR 360 is a part of former State Route 10 A route approximating the alignment of State Route 360 appears on maps as early as 1919. This road paralleled the path of the Southern Pacific Railroad from Rhodes through Basalt and into California. By 1929, the road had been designated as a part of State Route 10. The southern , between the California state line and Basalt, had been paved by 1936. This section became part of US 6 when it was extended through Nevada in 1937. The remainder of SR 10 was paved by 1955. Once the highway was paved, it remained relatively unchanged for several years. In 1976, Nevada began a renumbering of its state highways. In the route reassignment process, the portion of SR 10 concurrent with US 6 no longer carried a state highway number; the remainder of the highway north of Basalt became State Route 360. This action took place on July 1, 1976, and was first seen on state maps with the 1978 edition.

In that role he participated in Ernst Sch√§fer's 1938 journey to Tibet, helped the Race and Settlement Office, or SS-Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt, of the SS identify Jews, and later helped select human subjects to be killed to create an anatomical study collection of Jewish skeletons.De.Wikipedia.org: August Hirt:de:August Hirt#skelettsammlung Early life Beger (right) with the Tibet expedition and their Sikkimese interpreters, Kaiser Bahadur Thapa and Rabden Khazi, in 1938. Beger was born in 1911 to an old Heidelberg family that soon after came upon hard times when Beger's father was killed in World War I, but a family friend paid for him to attend the University of Jena where he was first exposed to Hans F. K. G√ºnther during a lecture, a man who would encourage him through his early academic career in anthropology and ethnology. Service in the SS In 1934, Beger began working a part-time job in the Race and Settlement Office of the SS where he eventually became a section head. Beger was asked to be part of an expedition to Hawaii, but while this was awaiting final approval, he was invited on a trip to Tibet led by Ernst Sch√§fer which he accepted instead. In a proposal he wrote to Sch√§fer, Beger stated his contribution to the expedition would be \\"to study the current racial-anthropological situation through measurements, trait research, photography and moulds... and to collect material about the proportion, origins, significance and development of the Nordic race in this region.\\"Joseph Cummins, History's great untold stories: obscure events of lasting importance, Murdoch Books, 2006, p. 327.

His assignment, which he carried out, was to provide the Nazi doctor with detainees of diverse ethnic types from various concentration camps in order to serve Hirt's lethal racial experiments. The work involved selecting over 100 individuals from Auschwitz to be murdered for their skeletons and exhibited as the Jewish skeleton collection. They were mainly Jews, and the crime was exposed during the Nuremberg trials in 1946. The collection was sanctioned by Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, and designed by and under the direction of August Hirt, with Rudolf Brandt and Wolfram Sievers, general manager of the Ahnenerbe, being responsible for procuring and preparing the corpses. The victims were sent to Natzweiler concentration camp for gassing by SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Joseph Kramer, the Kommandant of the camp. Their corpses were then sent to Hirt in Strasburg. In these endeavours he was assisted by doctors Hans Endres, Hans Fleischhacker, Heinrich R√ºbel and Rudolf Trojan. After the war In February 1948, Beger was classified as \\"exonerated\\" by a denazification tribunal unaware of his role in the skeleton collection. In 1960, an investigation into the collection began in Ludwigsburg, and Beger was taken into custody on 30 March 1960. He was released four months later. The investigation continued until coming to trial on 27 October 1970. Beger claimed that he was unaware the Auschwitz prisoners he measured were to be killed. While two others indicted in the trial were released, Beger was convicted on 6 April 1971, and sentenced to three years in prison for being an accomplice in the murder of 86 Jews. Upon appeal his sentence was reduced to three years of probation. Neither of his colleagues with whom he was tried, Hans Fleischhacker and Wolf-Dietrich Wolff, were convicted. According to his family, Beger died in K√∂nigstein im Taunus on 12 October 2009.

History  Allianz first created a separate asset management business in 1998 under the leadership of board member, Joachim Faber. Through a combination of asset management acquisitions as well as acquisitions of other businesses that had asset management units, Allianz established a large asset management division comprising different investment ‚Äòboutiques‚Äô. By 2010 the Allianz asset management division, going under the name of Allianz Global Investors by then had reached EUR 1500bn. In 2011, a decision was taken to combine most of the different investment managers into a globally integrated asset manager; from 2012 Allianz moved to what they call a ‚Äútwo pillar‚Äù model where Allianz Global Investors and PIMCO operate separately from each other despite common ownership. When Allianz Global Investors was established as an integrated asset manager in 2012, it was managing EUR 279bn in assets. By March 2019, assets under management were EUR 535bn; these assets were split between investments in equity (25%), fixed income (35%), multi asset (26%) and alternatives (14%).

Combs Mountain Parkway, commonly known as the Mountain Parkway, is a freeway in eastern Kentucky. The route runs from Interstate 64 just east of Winchester southeast for 75.627 miles (121.710 km) to a junction with U.S. Route 460 near Salyersville. The first , beginning at the western terminus in Winchester is a four-lane limited access highway with only minor design standard differences from an Interstate Highway, while the remainder is a limited access Super two highway. History A large portion of the parkway is four lanes wide The Bert T. Combs Mountain Parkway was built in the early 1960s and opened in January 1963 as Kentucky's second toll road. The route was originally signed only as the 'Mountain Parkway'. In the late 1970s, the \\"Bert T. Combs\\" name was added to honor the governor from the mountains who spearheaded construction of the highway. Auxiliary plates were added above the circular Mountain Parkway signs to mark the designation. As with all of Kentucky's toll roads, the tolls were removed as the construction bonds were paid off. Tolls were removed from the four-lane section in 1985, and the road became a freeway in 1986 when the remaining tolls were removed from the two- lane section. The Mountain Parkway used a circular shield used until the 2000s. The route was designated Kentucky Route 114 in April 1985. In August, the road was redesignated Kentucky Route 402. Later, in February 1990, the parkway was designated Kentucky Route 9000 from its western terminus to Kentucky Route 15 Spur near Campton and Kentucky Route 9009 from KY 15 Spur to the parkway's eastern terminus. Both designations are unsigned. On January 15, 2014, Kentucky governor Steve Beshear announced plans to extend the parkway to US 23 in Prestonsburg, which would include widening the highway to four lanes for its entire length. The project, which would cost more than $750 million and requires approval by the Kentucky General Assembly, would run through 2020, and is expected to lead to the reinstatement of tolls on the highway. On July 26, 2019, Matt Bevin announced a $70M plan to expand the parkway.http://www.news- expressky.com/news/article_200dde2a-b024-11e9-a5f9-73d9d4710d05.html Exit list References External links *Mountain Parkway exit list 9000 Two-lane freeways in the United States Kentucky parkway system ","title":"Bert T.

Population: 7,815 (2002 Census; 10,900 (1967). History Verkhoturye was founded in 1598 by Vasily Golovin and Ivan Voyeykov on the site of the Vogul settlement of Neromkar. There were major fires in 1674 and 1738. The railroad arrived in 1906. It lost town status in 1926 and regained it in 1947. Two oil pipelines pass through the area and there are plans to build an oil refinery. In contrast to the surrounding mining towns, Verkhoturye has been relatively untouched by industrialization and much of its historic appearance has been preserved. Being one of the oldest Russian settlements east of the Urals, and with forty churches in the area, Verkhoturye is considered one of the centers of Russian Christianity. Famous churches include the Trinity Church (1703‚Äî1712), Nikolay Monastery (established in 1604) with the Cathedral of Exaltation of the Holy Cross (1905‚Äî1913), and Transfiguration Church (1821). In addition, the town houses the oldest female monastery beyond Urals (established in 1621). =The Gateway to Siberia= The Trinity Cathedral was built in 1703-12 The relatively low middle Ural Mountains at the latitude of Verkhoturye form a natural gateway into Siberia from the west. With the Russian conquest of Siberia and the foundation of the trans-Ural Russian towns of Tyumen in 1586 and Tobolsk in 1587 the problem arose of finding the best route to them from European Russia. Around 1580, Yermak Timofeyevich had ascended the Chusovaya River south of Verkhoturye and crossed to the Barancha, a tributary of the Tagil River. This route was abandoned because the upper Tagil was too shallow. Around 1590 a more northerly route was opened from Cherdyn north of Solikamsk up to the Vishera River and down the Lozva River. In 1597 Artemy Babinov pioneered what became the standard route. This Babinsky Road ran overland from Solikamsk on the western slope of the Urals to Verkhoturye. An ostrog (fort) was built at Verkhoturye in 1598 and a customs house in 1600 or 1601. Until about 1763, Babinov's route was the main road into Siberia. All winter sledges would haul goods from Solikamsk to Verkhoturye where they were stockpiled until the spring thaw. Siberian furs collected as yasak (tribute) passed through Verkhoturye en route to the Sable Treasury in Moscow. Privately owned furs leaving Siberia paid a 10% tax unless the merchant could prove that the tax had been paid in Siberia. Goods entering Siberia paid a 4% tax (in addition to the 10% paid when the goods were sold). Goods coming and going were inspected and inventoried to prevent contraband. Guard posts were set up in the region to prevent people from slipping around the custom house. Verkhoturye in 1910 Around 1600, Turinsk was built downriver and a winter ice-road was built to connect the two settlements. At some point the Irbit Fair downriver became a major trading place. In 1695, all routes from the Kama basin except Verkhoturye were legally closed. Verkhoturye declined from about 1763 when the Siberian Route was built through Yekaterinburg to the south. In the 1770s the toll for crossing into Siberia was abolished or reduced. =Other Ural crossings= To the north the three crossing points were the Arctic Ocean, the Usa River, and the Northern Sosva River. These all connected the lower Ob River to the Pechora River and the export port of Arkhangelsk. The routes around Verkhoturye connected Tobolsk to the Kama River tributary of the Volga and on to the Sable Treasury at Moscow. Below Verkhoturye there was an old caravan route which led to the Ufa steppe and the Volga River. This became more important as the Volga population increased, but remained minor because it did not lead to either Moscow or Arkhangelsk.

(b) Dissolution of Provincial Assembly by the Governor on the approval by the President. ‚Äì Clause 2 of the same Article again empowers the Governor to dissolve Provincial Assembly subject to the approval of the President, where he is of the opinion, that after having been passed a vote of no confidence against the Chief Minister, there is no other member of the Provincial Assembly to command the confidence of the majority of the members of the Provincial Assembly, in a session of the Provincial Assembly summoned for the purpose. =Executive Authority of a province= Executive Authority is exercised by the Governor and under Article 105, he shall act in accordance with advice of the cabinet or the Chief Minister. =Appointment and ascertainment of Chief Minister= According to clause 2-A of Article 130, the Governor of a Province invites the member of the Provincial Assembly to be the Chief Minister who commands the confidence of the majority of the members of the Provincial Assembly as ascertained in the session of the Assembly summoned for the purpose in accordance with the provisions of the constitution. =Powers and functions of Provincial Assembly= There are three major functions or powers of a Provincial Assembly: # To make laws (Article 141 and 142 of the Constitution of Pakistan) # To manage the purse of the nation (Article 123 (3)) # To keep checks on the policies and practices of the Government (Article 130) =Limitations= One of the major functions of the Provincial Assembly is to make laws as provided in Article 141 of the Constitution for conferring of functions upon officers or authorities subordinate to the Provincial Governments, Constitutionally. This function is subject to some limitations. # Under Article 142, a Provincial Assembly cannot legislate when an emergency is declared in the country. # A Provincial Assembly cannot make law which is against fundamental rights. # Principles of policy or rule of law should be the base of each law. # A law cannot be enacted if it is not in conformity with the injunctions of Islam. =Federal Legislative List and Concurrent Legislative List= By virtue of Article 142, the Provincial Assembly cannot legislate on matters which do not fall within its purview. However, under the same article, the Provincial Assembly can legislate on matters mentioned in Concurrent Legislative List. But where parliament makes a law in Concurrent Legislative List, and Provincial Assembly also legislates on it, the Provincial law will be void to the extent that it conflicts with the Federal law. =Residuary List= The Provincial Assembly has exclusive powers to make law with respect to any matter not enumerated either in the Federal Legislative List or in the Concurrent Legislative List. Such list is called a Residuary List. Residuary matters are exclusively within Provincial autonomy. From the above, it cannot be extracted that the Province is subordinate to the Federation or Federation is subordinate to Province. In fact, legislative powers are distributed between Federation and Provinces vide Article 142. And one institution cannot take over powers of other institution. However, this provincial law making power comes to an end and shifts to the Federation during emergency when declared vide Articles 232, 233 or 234. Manager of purse of a nation The second important function of Provincial Assembly under Article 123 (3) is that it acts as a manager or custodian of the purse of a nation. Provincial Consolidated Fund No expenditure from the Provincial Consolidated Fund is deemed to be duly authorised unless it is specified in the schedule so authenticated and is laid before the Provincial Assembly. Provincial Assembly exercises checks over executive through control over the Finance. Article 119 provides custody and withdrawal of money from Provincial Consolidated Fund, (defined in Article 118) and public accounts of a Province, unless it is regulated by the Act of the Provincial Assembly. =Annual and supplementary Budget statement= Provisions given under Article 120 dealing with annual budget statement and Article 124 dealing with supplementary budget or excess grant become effective, when it is approved by the Provincial Assembly. =Approval of budgets= Article 122(2) and Article 124 authorise Provincial Assembly to approve or refuse any demand and reduce the amount specified in the demand. Once budget is approved, the Government has no right to deviate from these sanctions. For excess expenditure, Government has to seek regularization from the Assembly. Similarly under Article 88 read with Article 127, accounts and audit reports of the Government are further scrutinized by the public accounts Committee of the Assembly. =To keep checks on the policies and practices of the Government= The significance of Provincial Assembly is that it is a representative institution and keeps checks upon policies, practices and performance of the Government. Article 130 (4) says that the Cabinet shall be collectively responsible to the Provincial Assembly. Devices of accountability Issues relating to Public interest are raised by the Members for discussion in the House in the form of questions, adjournment motions, call attention notices, general discussion, resolutions and various Reports. The Members make the Executive accountable to the legislature through these devices according to the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997. Members Support Programme This programme is meant to serve Members of the Provincial Assembly in different areas. They are provided legislative help in drafting private members bills. They are provided useful and informative books. An Internet facility is also available to them, and through Internet research they can polish their ideas. To provide these facilities to the Members, in 1997 the Research and Reference Division was formed. It was established to provide information to the Members when needed, and to collect up-to-date information from the resources available. The Library and Computer Sections were included in this division. It was also meant to provide help to the representatives in legislative procedures, such as the drafting of a bill. Prior to the establishment of the Research and Reference Wing, this service was performed by the Legislation Branch. Automation Section and Library Section The primary function of Library Section is to provide data to the Members and to the Research Section. Information such as the Assembly's agenda, date of next sitting, schedule of committee meetings and information about Members is available due to installation of the latest PBX. The Assembly Secretariat has stored vital information in the computer and it is accessible from anywhere around the clock. Moreover, Research and Reference Division has designed a web page to provide information to the Members about the Assembly Secretariat and proceedings of the Assembly including its schedule and agenda, and a summary of its proceedings. This web page also includes the procedural rules for the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab and some other important laws of the country.

Today it is a sport in its own right, enjoying popularity not only in Egypt but in other countries. Several of these countries make up the International Federation of Speed-Ball (FISB).  Description  thumb A hollow ball in latex revolves around a metallic mast (1,70m high) which is linked by a nylon thread (fishing thread type) of 1,70m length. The thread is knotted to the mast by a loop or a plastic ring freely revolving around a reel. The mast is fixed in a base from 40 kg to 90 kg. The ball is elliptic and is hit with a rigid plastic racquet with a small handle and a strings around 25 cm of diameter. The speed-ball court is about 6x4 m. for the single match and 8x6 m. for the doubles.  Rules for speed-ball  Speed-ball is played alone (super- solo), with two players (single match), or four players (double match),or four players (relay) = Super-solo = thumb In Super-solo, the aim is to hit the ball a maximum times in one minute. At first with the right hand, then a minute again with the left hand, then with two racquets in fore-hand only, then with two racquets in back-hand only. The number of hits of each movement is added to make the final score of the solo. The duration of one movement is 30 seconds for the players under 14 years old and one minute for older players. A break of 30 seconds for all classes is granted behind each movement. The best players can do up to 160 hits in one minute. The current men's world record is 614 hits, set by Egypt's Mohamed Nagy, while the women's record of 539 hits set by Egyptian Noha AbouZeid in the 26th world championship In Kuwait. = Single match = thumb The single match is played by two players, each with one racquet. Each player has his own ground, separated by a neutral strip 60 cm wide (the diameter of the speed-ball's base). A match is divided into games of 10 points. The players attempt to hit the ball once each in turn, inverting its direction of rotation. To score points, the ball must pass twice successively across the opponent's ground, without the opponent being able to return it. If there is a fault, the point is missed and there is a new service. The service is alternated according to who wins each point. The first player to score 10 points wins the game. The first player who wins two games (three games for men's seniors) wins the match. = Double match = thumb The double match takes place like the single, in two teams of two players. In each team, the players serve and hit the ball alternatively. The general rules are the same as the single. Specific mistakes involve the player's rotation and reception of the ball.  Federation  The International Federation of Speed-Ball (FISB) was founded in 1984 by the membership of Egypt, France, and Japan. Several other countries joined the federation (Kuwait, KSA, Austria, Slovenia, Denmark, Pakistan, Sudan, India, Lebanon, Nigeria, Afghanistan, UAE, ...).

Philipp Albert Stapfer (Bern, 23 September 1766 ‚Äì Paris, 27 March 1840) was a Swiss politician and philosopher. He was the plenipotentiary envoi of the Helvetic Republic to the French consulate in Paris from 1801 till 1803. ( Act of Mediation ) He married and settled in France, at the Chateau de Talcy (Loir-et-Cher) and in Paris where he became the friend of Maine de Biran -in 1805 at informal gatherings of Cabanis circle at Auteuil. He was also vice-president of the Paris Protestant society. He is the recipient of Maine de Biran's essay: : \\"R√©ponses aux arguments contre l'aperception imm√©diate d'une liaison causale entre le vouloir primitif et la motion et contre la d√©rivation d'un principe universel et n√©cessaire de causalit√©s de cette source.\\" (1818); an important r√©sum√© known as: \\"R√©ponses √† Stapfer\\" Pestalozzi Philipp Albert Stapfer also shared with Maine de Biran a pronounced interest in the educational experiments of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. As a Minister of Sciences and Arts of the Helvetic Republic in 1798 he arranged the nomination of Pestalozzi as chief editor of the government paper \\"Helvetisches Volksblatt\\" -a post from which Pestalozzi quickly resigned. In Paris Stapfer pleaded Pestalozzi's case for educational reform with Napoleon Bonaparte, who denigrated the program for its alleged lack of real science. Maine de Biran however -following the encounters with Stapfer at Auteuil and his own appointement as \\"sous-pr√©fet\\" of the Dordogne in 1806- reformed the education in his department by inviting to Bergerac a teacher formed by Pestalozzi at Yverdon. Philosopher Apart from being an involved and tolerant Protestant philosopher Stapfer, with Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re, Joseph-Marie de G√©rando, Pierre Paul Royer-Collard, Georges Cuvier and many others was a regular participant in the philosophical debates organised by Maine de Biran, after the latter finally settled in Paris as an administrator in 1812. Together with Deg√©rando, who introduced Kant studies in France, he was one of Maine de Biran's main sources on the philosophy of Immanuel Kant whose work he followed in its development by one of Kant's pupils: Friedrich Bouterwek (1766-1828), professor in Philosophy at the Georg August University in G√∂ttingen. Meyers Lexicon Mannheim 1990 links Bouterwek with Maine de Biran. Bouterwek was already lecturing on Kant at G√∂ttingen when Stapfer studied there in 1789-1790. The extent of Stapfer's knowledge of Kant can be judged from the substantial (pagelong) notes he appended to Maine de Biran's: \\"Exposition de la doctrine philosophique de Leibniz. Compos√©e pour la Biographie Universelle\\" (Paris: Michaud ed 1819). This exposition written at the instigation of Stapfer is one of only two (authorised) philosophical texts by Maine de Biran published during his lifetime. (Stapfer's notes were republished by Pierre Tisserand in his Oeuvres de Maine de Biran,1939 -Tome XI pp435‚Äì489 ) Stapfer long survived his immediate contemporaries de Biran and Bouterwek. He arranged for his own salon, inviting guests such as Victor Cousin, Sainte-Beuve, Guizot to whom he became an important material witness of the preceding decades. It took the untiring persistence of Stapfer to encourage Victor Cousin and Joseph Lain√© to classify and publish the works of Maine de Biran.

He is Auditor General of the Nation since June 2020. He was National Senator for R√≠o Negro Province for eighteen years and was the vice-presidential candidate of Juntos por el Cambio in 2019. Biography Pichetto was born in Banfield, Buenos Aires. He earned a law degree at the National University of La Plata in 1976 and relocated to R√≠o Negro Province, where he served as counsel for Hierro Patag√≥nico Sierra Grande, a pig iron smelter, and for the Provincial Government. Political career He was elected to the Sierra Grande City Council in 1983, and in 1985 became mayor of the city, serving until 1987. Pichetto married Mar√≠a Teresa Minassian, with whom he had two children. Pichetto was elected to the Provincial Assembly in 1988, and was re-elected in 1991. He was named president of the R√≠o Negro Province chapter of the PJ, and was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies in 1993. He was named Vice-President of the Justicialist caucus in the Lower House in 1997; elections that year resulted in steep losses for the PJ, and Pichetto was not re-elected to a second term. Throughout his career he was a \\"disciplined\\" party man, and supported President Carlos Menem's neo-liberal break from the traditionally populist PJ platform during the 1990s. Pichetto took a leading role on legal, justice and penal matters and was appointed to the Council of Magistracy of the Nation, the senior justice advisory body, in 1998, and re-elected in 2001. He sat on the committees on prosecution, the appointment of judges and judicial school, and later chaired the disciplinary committee, and served on the administration and finance committees. Pichetto was elected senator in 2001, his term ending in 2007. He was elected President of the PJ caucus in the Senate on December 30, 2002, and despite his earlier support for the more conservative Menem, became a prominent Kirchnerist. He thus joined the center-left Front for Victory faction of the PJ in support of President N√©stor Kirchner. Pichetto campaigned for governor of R√≠o Negro Province in the 2007 elections. There was some doubt as to whether Kirchner would support fellow Peronist Pichetto, or the incumbent UCR governor, Miguel Saiz, who was a leading supporter of Kirchner from (the opposition) UCR ranks. Kirchner ultimately kept out of the provincial elections, and Pichetto lost to Saiz. Pichetto was re-elected to the Senate that year, however. He retained a key role in the passage of numerous Kirchnerist initiatives through the Senate, though differences arose with President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner over his support of the Law of the Protection of Glaciers in 2010: he was among those who voted for the bill, which passed on September 30 and was later vetoed by the president. Pichetto also objected to the president's support of R√≠o Negro Governor Miguel Saiz of the UCR (to whom he lost in 2007). These differences cost Pichetto clout in the Senate among fellow Kirchnerists, and contributed to the president's decision against endorsing Pichetto as the PJ candidate for governor in 2011; Carlos Soria won the nomination instead, and was ultimately elected governor. The untimely death of Governor Soria in January 2012 enhanced Pichetto's role in R√≠o Negro politics. He was appointed president of the R√≠o Negro PJ, and his son, Juan Manuel Pichetto, was appointed Minister of Production in the horticulture-rich province - becoming thought of by opponents as a \\"shadow governor\\" to Soria's successor, Alberto Weretilneck. From his bench Pichetto accompanied the main projects of the government of Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, such as resolution 125, the nationalization of the AFJP and the media law. After Mauricio Macri assumed the presidency in 2015, Pichetto accompanied several of the legislative projects of the new management. One of them was the voluntary payment of USD 9.3 billion to the vulture funds, which would allow him to leave the country of the default in which he was. He also supported the pension reform carried out in 2017. The interior minister, Rogelio Frigerio, highlighted the role of Pichetto, since it has been fundamental for the approval of more than 200 laws favorable to the government of Cambiemos.

Robert is probably the same Robert as mentioned in some, or all, of the following references:- * 1232-33 Sir Robert de Scales lord of the manors of Bedenested and Scolegh in Essex, Parva Willington in Kent and Lynne, Middelton and Ilsington in Norfolk.Book of Fees * 1242-43 Sir Robert de Scales lord of the manors of Parva Wilmynton in Kent, Wilton, Hocwolde, Herdwic and Nudebonve in Norfolk, Wetherden and Wridelincton in Suffolk =Peter de Scales= Robert's eldest son who inherited his father's lands but died shortly afterwards in 1258. =Robert de Scales= Peter's younger brother who inherited their father's lands upons Peter's death in 1258. Robert was involved in several expeditions to France and had summons to Parliament. He was listed at Dover Castle from 1261-2, as was a Sir Radulfus de Escales. Upon Robert's death in 1266 he was succeeded by his son Robert, who he had by his wife Muriel, and who was to become the first of the Baron Scales. Left a widow called ClemenciaPatent Rolls History of the Barony The Scales barony was created in 1299 by writ for Robert de Scales. The last known holders were Elizabeth de Scales and her husband Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers. After Elisabeth's death in 1473, Anthony was summoned in her right. Anthony was beheaded by Richard III at Pontefract on 24 Jun 1483 and the peerage fell into abeyance. However, after the death of Anthony, his younger brother Edward Woodville, a supporter of Henry Tudor, styled himself Lord Scales, having been bequeathed Elizabeth's land by his brother.C. P. Wilkins, \\"Woodville, Sir Edward (d. 1488), soldier and courtier\\", Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press 2011. Several people have subsequently tried to claim the title but none have been successful. The most recent was made by Sir Charles Robert Tempest who claimed to be a co-heir in 1857.House of Lords, Supplemental Case of the House of Lords Residences The Scales family's main residences were Middleton in Norfolk, Newsells in Hertfordshire and Rivenhall in Essex but also held other lands including Ouresby and Torneton in Lincolnshire.Patent Rolls Barons Scales (1299) * Robert de Scales, 1st Baron Scales (d. 1304) * Robert de Scales, 2nd Baron Scales (d. 1324) * Robert de Scales, 3rd Baron Scales (d. 1369) * Roger de Scales, 4th Baron Scales (d. 1386) * Robert de Scales, 5th Baron Scales (d. 1402) * Robert de Scales, 6th Baron Scales (d. 1418) * Thomas de Scales, 7th Baron Scales (d. 1460) * Elizabeth de Scales Woodville, Baroness Scales (d. 2 September 1473) References 1299 establishments in England Abeyant baronies in the Peerage of England Noble titles created in 1299 ","title":"Baron Scales"},{"id":"5757357","text":"Nepenthes laevis may refer to: *Nepenthes laevis Lindl.

It is widely used for hay and forage. It is a principal species in the widespread National Vegetation Classification habitat community MG1 (Arrhenatherum elatius grassland) in the United Kingdom, and so can be found with Arrhenatherum elatius (false oat grass). Dactylis glomerata in Swakane Canyon, Chelan County Washington It can be found in meadows, pasture, roadsides, and rough grassland. It has been introduced into North America, New Zealand and Australia, and is now widely naturalised. In some areas, it has become an invasive species. One of the keys to distinguishing this species from other grasses are its flat stems Description Cock's-foot grows in dense perennial tussocks to tall, with grey-green leaves long and up to broad, and a distinctive tufted triangular flowerhead long, which may be either green or red- to purple-tinged (usually green in shade, redder in full sun), turning pale grey-brown at seed maturity. The spikelets are long, typically containing two to five flowers. It has a characteristic flattened stem base which distinguishes it from many other grasses. It flowers from June to September.Hubbard, C. E. Grasses. Penguin. 1978. Flower head Taxonomy Dactylis glomerata is treated as the sole species in the genus Dactylis by some authors, while others include one to four other species.Species Records of Dactylis, Dactylis glomerata. Germplasm Resources Information Network. It is commonly divided into several regional subspecies, particularly by those authors accepting only the single species: *Dactylis glomerata subsp. glomerata.

Tetraploid forms are larger and coarser than diploid forms. Cultivation and uses Cock's-foot is widely used as a hay grass and for pastures because of its high yields and sugar content, which makes it sweeter than most other temperate grasses. In dry areas as in much of Australia, Mediterranean subspecies such as subsp. hispanica are preferred for their greater drought tolerance.NSW Department of Primary Industries PrimeFacts: Cocksfoot It requires careful grazing management; if it is undergrazed it becomes coarse and unpalatable. In some areas to which it has been introduced, cock's-foot has become an invasive weed, notably some areas of the eastern United States. As with other grasses, the pollen can cause allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in some people. The grass is popularly grown to satisfy the craving of domestic cats to chew grass, hence its colloquial name cat grass.Victoria Nursery: Catgrass plant The seeds were first collected by Rogers Parker in Hertfordshire; this was then developed by the agricultural reformer Coke of Norfolk.

Olivier and Holloway do their own singing in this film, but Dorothy Tutin and several others were dubbed. This was Laurence Olivier's only film musical. With additional dialogue and lyrics by Christopher Fry, the film expands on some elements in the opera, such as giving Mrs Trapes (Athene Seyler) a larger role and adding dramatic action sequences to Macheath's escape. The framing device is also changed: the Beggar (Hugh Griffith) is himself a prisoner in Newgate with the real Macheath, who escapes at the end under cover of the confusion created when the Beggar decides that his fictional Macheath should be reprieved. The film was the cinema directing debut for renowned stage director Brook, and also includes one of the first film performances of the comic actor Kenneth Williams. Plot In the 1700s, a beggar is tossed into London's Newgate jail, along with a pile of papers upon which his unfinished opera is scribbled. The beggar boasts to the other prisoners that his opera, unlike others of the day, is about a real person, the dashing highwayman Captain Macheath, who, dressed in a red coat, holds off the world with a pistol in each hand, seduces women with five notes of a tune, and generally leaps from misfortune. To the beggar's disappointment, the other prisoners point out that his hero Macheath is among them, in irons and behind bars, and Macheath, who is scheduled to be executed the next morning, admits that there is \\"no arguing with reality.\\" Taking the first page of the opera, Macheath begins singing, and the beggar, encouraged by Macheath's good voice, urges him to continue, until the following story, the beggar's opera, is sung for the prison inmates: While riding to London, feeling merry and free, Macheath robs a carriage, and steals a kiss and a locket from a maiden. Later, in London, Macheath's wife, Polly Peachum, pines for him. Polly's parents, shopkeepers Mr. Peachum and his wife, are scandalized to learn from their employee Filch that Polly has secretly married the highwayman. To make the best of the situation, as they are always eager to make money, they urge her to lure Macheath into a trap and collect the reward for his capture. Meanwhile, outside of town, Macheath encounters a carriage ridden by Newgate's jailor Mr. Lockit, Lockit's daughter Lucy and Mrs. Trapes, whom Lockit is wooing. Lucy, who met Macheath when he was once imprisoned, scolds him for taking her virtue without making good on his promise to wed. When Macheath rides off, Mrs. Trapes suggests that Lucy betray him for the reward and give the money to her father. Later, during a tryst in a hayloft, Polly warns Macheath that her parents are mounting an ambush. Macheath escapes with Polly's help after a swashbuckling fight, then hides in a back room of a tavern, where he is unable to resist socializing with the prostitutes, whom he considers friends. However, prostitute Jenny Diver has been bribed by Peachum and Lockit to betray him, and with the help of her colleagues, Macheath is soon captured. From his jail cell, Macheath urges Lucy to steal the jail keys and set him free, promising to marry her in return, but then Polly shows up and he is forced to introduce the women to each other. During the night, Lucy steals the keys and releases him, but later Polly sneaks back and, finding Macheath gone from the cell, screams in anguish without thinking, thus drawing attention to his escape. Meanwhile, Macheath disguises himself in the stolen cape and gloves of a lord and slips into a gaming house to avoid making good his promise to unite with Lucy. However, the proprietor recognizes the cape and alerts Lockit and Peachum about the impostor wearing it. Back at the jail, Polly is accused of freeing Macheath and is locked in Lucy's room, where Lucy, after losing track of Macheath, attempts to drug her. When they hear the recaptured Macheath being returned to prison, Lucy and Polly proceed to Macheath's cell and demand that he choose between them. He refuses, as he will soon be hanged and sees no reason to disappoint either of them. The next morning, riding atop his coffin as it is carted through the streets to the gallows, Macheath waves farewell to the friendly crowd that has gathered to see him off. At the gallows, after kissing both Lucy and Polly goodbye, Macheath is blindfolded and awaits his fate, and the opera comes to its incomplete end. The real Macheath, who is still in the jail, protests that he should not have to hang twice. After pondering the complaint, the beggar agrees and yells for Macheath's reprieve. The rest of the prisoners join in the chant and mob the turnkey, who comes to investigate the ruckus, allowing Macheath to escape. The highwayman steals a horse from the cart containing his coffin and when safely out of London, sings that his freedom has been returned because of a beggar's opera. Cast Production Olivier received a fee of ¬£50,000, ¬£30,000 of which he deferred because he was interested in working with Peter Brook. While the film was being shot, producer Herbert Wilcox was directing another film, Laughing Anne. Wilcox later wrote that during the film \\"Larry and I were in complete harmony but we could not get to first base with Peter.\\"Wilcox p 164 He claims Olivier and he constantly offered Brook practical suggestions which were ignored. Olivier was injured during filming performing a stunt. This caused insurance dramas and Wilcox had to pay ¬£31,000 out of his own pocket. Wilcox's fee was ¬£50,000, ¬£30,000 of which was deferred. Alexander Korda provided finance for foreign rights. The film was sold to Jack Warner for $700,000 - who bought it without seeing it - so Korda made a profit but Olivier and Wilcox did not receive their deferred payment.Wilcox p 167 References External links 1953 films 1950s historical musical films British historical musical films British films English-language films Films based on operas Films directed by Peter Brook Films set in the 1720s Films about capital punishment Films set in London Laurence Olivier 1953 directorial debut films ","title":"The Beggar's Opera (film)"},{"id":"5757369","text":"Punjab Assembly may refer to: * Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, the unicameral legislature in Lahore, Pakistan * Punjab Legislative Assembly, the unicameral legislature of the state of Punjab, northern India * Punjab Legislative Assembly (British India), the legislature of the province of Punjab in British India, established by British authorities in 1910 ","title":"Punjab Assembly"},{"id":"5757370","text":"M.DIA was a footwear trademark founded in 1999, in suburbs of Paris (France), by Mohamed Dia.

Cities are listed alphabetically by their current best-known name in English. The English version is followed by variants in other languages, in alphabetical order by name, and then by any historical variants and former names. Several cities have diacritics in their listed name in English. It is very common that the press strip the diacritics and that means a parallel diacritic-free version is very often used in English.

Background Melo Autunes was the son of Ernesto Augusto Antunes (1907‚Äì1986) and Maria Jos√© Forjaz de Melo (1911‚Äì1987). Born in Lisbon, he moved to Angola at the age of 6, as a result of his father's military posting. He returned to Portugal at the age of 10 and lived in Aveiro and Tavira. Under pressure from his family, he entered military college in 1953. An avid reader since youth, he attended classes at the University of Lisbon in Philosophy (his main interest) and Law. His intellectual curiosity led him to read Marx and other authors prohibited by the Portuguese Dictatorship, and led to his exile to the Azores in 1957. Deeply involved in cultural and political activities he formed in 1962, with Manuel Alegre, the Patriotic Action of the Azores. The group which supported activities to counter political propaganda. His most daring project was instigating a military and popular revolt in the Azores, with the promised support of General Humberto Delgado. This attempt was unsuccessful, as General Delgado withdrew support. In 1971-1973, he completed his third and last combat posting in Angola, an experience that was instrumental in forming his anti-colonialist political thinking. It was a traumatic experience, which led him to declare that he had fought on the \\"wrong side.\\" His initial participation in the Movement of Captains, a military group plotting to overthrow the dictatorship, occurred in 1974. He was recognised immediately for his solid knowledge, and he was asked to draft the political program of the Movement of the Armed Forces (MFA). Thus began his role as the \\"intellectual in uniform\\" and his role as the author of some of the most important political documents of the Carnation Revolution. Career highlights Melo Antunes was the principal author of the political program of the military movement that overthrew the regime, the Movement of the Armed Forces. Known as the 3 D's, the Programme of the MFA proposed decolonization, democratization, and development. After the revolution, Melo Antunes was in the forefront of political power and highly respected. He was a member of the Coordinating Commission of the Movement (MFA), and after the revolutionary period was member of the Portuguese Council of State. He was Minister without Portfolio of the II and II Provisional Governments. One of his first roles was to manage the complex decolonization process, following the promulgation of Law 7/74 on July 27, 1974 that \\"acknowledged the independence of overseas territories.\\" Melo Antunes was the main negotiator of the independence of Guinea-Bissau. He was responsible for a Working Group tasked to establish a Socio-Economic Program, under the III Provisional Government. Although the Working Group comprised key socio-economic figures of the period (Rui Vilar, Silva Lopes, Maria de Lurdes Pintasilgo and Vitor Constancio), the document became known as the Plan Melo Antunes. It was a controversial plan, which caused tensions within the Movement of the Armed Forces (MFA), and this was finally overturned on March 11, 1975. Appointed member of the Revolutionary Council on March 14, 1975, he retained this position until dissolution of the Council as a result of the Constitutional Revision of 1982. He was Minister of Foreign Affairs in the IV (March 26 to August 8, 1975) and VI (September 19, 1975 to July 22, 1976) Provisional Governments. During the summer (Verao Quente) of intense political-ideological struggle, Melo Antunes produced on August 7, 1975 the Document of Nine (Documento dos Nove), a document released by the Movement of Nine (Movimento dos Nove). This document proposed a third way in the form of an original political platform that rejected the extreme left-wing and the Communist Bloc-inspired action of the Portuguese Communist Party, as well as the social-democratic model of many countries of Western Europe, while maintaining the importance of a pluralistic democracy. This document was welcomed with relief by both the military and civilian population, disenchanted with the increasing hegemony of Vasco Goncalves and the Portuguese Communist Party, and ended up adopted by all as a common program. Another of his major political intervention occurred on November 25, 1975, when in the face of pressure to ban the Communist Party, he appeared on television to defend its right to continued existence as an integral part of Portuguese democracy. This act caused him enemies lasting throughout his life, but also led to great admiration for his courage and to his being perceived by many as the \\"guiding light\\" for members of the Revolutionary Military who did not wish to see a new dictatorship imposed. Between 1977 and 1983, he served as President of the Constitutional Commission, the percursor to the Constitutional Tribunal. During the second Presidency of Ant√≥nio Ramalho Eanes, he served as member of the Council of State, and again during the Presidency of Jorge Sampaio. He was Advisor (1984) and Assistant Director General (1986‚Äì1988) of UNESCO. Despite calls for his candidacy for the Presidency of UNESCO in 1992, the Portuguese Government declined support. In 1991, he joined the Socialist Party, his first formal adherence to any political party. In 2004, he was promoted posthumously to Colonel. Decorations He received the Grand Cross of the Order of Liberty for his services to the country and to democracy. Marriage and issue He married Gabriela Maria da C√¢mara de Ataide Mota (b. 9 July 1941), daughter of Lu√≠s de Ata√≠de Mota (1912‚Äì1969) and Maria Eduarda de Medeiros da C√¢mara de Melo Cabral (b.

It runs from Leipziger Platz, an octagonal square adjacent to Potsdamer Platz in the west, to Spittelmarkt in the east. Part of the Bundesstra√üe 1 highway, it is today one of the city's main east‚Äìwest road links. History Leipziger Stra√üe has existed along this line since about the Baroque Friedrichstadt extension, laid out in 1688 at the behest of Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg. It was named after Leipzig Gate near Spittelmarkt, part of the Berlin Fortress which was finally slighted in 1738. In 1734 the road was extended up to the new Potsdam Gate, present-day Potsdamer Platz, one of the western entrances in what was then the Berlin Customs Wall. Near the eastern end, Leipziger Stra√üe traversed , named after Prussian general lieutenant Alexander von D√∂nhoff (1683‚Äì1742), where an obelisk marked the zero point of the mileage on the road to Potsdam. Prime minister Karl August von Hardenberg (1750‚Äì1822) had a city palais built here, which from 1848 served as seat of the Prussian Landtag. Around the corner a Concerthaus was erected in the 1860s, the concert hall of the Benjamin Bilse orchestra, predecessor of the Berlin Philharmonic. Next to it Oscar Tietz opened his first department store in 1900, financed by his uncle Hermann Tietz (Hertie), starting the development of Leipziger Stra√üe into a major shopping street. Nearby is the intersection with Jerusalemer Stra√üe, named after Jerusalem Church, one of Berlin's oldest churches, dating from the late 15th century, rebuilt in the 19th century according to plans designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. The church was heavily damaged by Allied bombing in World War II and its ruins were demolished by the Senate of West Berlin in March 1961 to build the Axel Springer AG headquarters. Wertheim department store in the 1920s At its western end Leipziger Platz was given its current name in 1815 in celebration of the Coalition victory over the French Empire at the Battle of Leipzig, and it is sometimes assumed that Leipziger Stra√üe was named at the same time: in fact it already had this name after the historic trade route to Leipzig. On the corner with Leipziger Stra√üe stood the Wertheim department store, then the biggest in Europe. Demolished in 1955/56 the preserved basement of its ruins housed the Tresor techno nightclub in the 1990s. It is now the site of the Mall of Berlin shopping mall. The area around the Wilhelmstra√üe intersection before World War II was one of the centres of German national administration, being the location of various governmental buildings. Near Leipziger Platz was the first seat of the German Reichstag parliament, before the inauguration of the Reichstag building in 1894. The neighbouring house, former residence of Abraham Mendelssohn Bartholdy (1776‚Äì1835), was purchased by the Prussian state in 1856 as seat of the Prussian House of Lords. The present-day building which now houses the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German Parliament, was erected between 1899 and 1903. After the House of Lords was abolished in 1918, the building became the seat of the Prussian State Council of the Free State of Prussia, where delegates from the provinces met for annual sittings. The Cologne mayor Konrad Adenauer served as president of this body until the Nazi Machtergreifung in 1933, when the building became the seat of the (Preu√üenhaus Foundation), controlled by Hermann G√∂ring. The building suffered severe damage during World War II, but was repaired and used during the GDR period to house several government offices, where the East German government was seized by insurgents during the Uprising of 17 June 1953. The Bundesrat held its first session in this building in 2000. Between 1933 and 1936 Hermann G√∂ring oversaw the construction of the vast Reich Air Ministry building next to the Preu√üenhaus at Leipziger Stra√üe No. 7, on the corner of Wilhelmstra√üe. After 1949, when Leipziger Stra√üe was located in East Berlin, the barely damaged complex became the headquarters of the GDR Council of Ministers. Today it houses the German Federal Ministry of Finance. Further east was the Reichspost Ministry building, today home of the Museum for Communication. Today Komplex Leipziger Stra√üe buildings Large sections of Leipziger Stra√üe were destroyed in World War II. Upon the erection of the Berlin Wall, the east‚Äìwest connection at Potsdamer Platz was closed. Despite the low traffic volume, the eastern half of the road between Spittelmarkt and Charlottenstra√üe from 1969 onwards was broadened and rebuilt as a prestigious street of a Socialist capital with four car lanes in each direction, a median and broad pavements including an underpass for pedestrians. On both sides large housing estates of the were erected. D√∂nhoffplatz was rebuilt as a green area and decorated with the reconstructed 18th century colonnades by Carl von Gontard, installed roughly at the historic site. The western half of the road retained its historic dimensions and has been newly built-up almost completely since German reunification. A tram line from Alexanderplatz to Potsdamer Platz along Leipziger Stra√üe is planned, tracks are already installed on some sections. Other buildings along Leipziger Stra√üe include the Bulgarian and New Zealand embassies.

It was under the influence of Srivijaya for some time, but later became independent from it. The name had been forgotten until scholars recognized Tambralinga as Nakhon Si Thammarat (Nagara Sri Dharmaraja). In Sanskrit and Prakrit, tƒÅm(b)ra means \\"copper\\", \\"copper-coloured\\" or \\"red\\" and linga means \\"symbol\\" or \\"creation\\", typically representing the divine energy of Shiva. Tambralinga first sent an embassy to China under the Song dynasty in 1001. In the twelfth century it may have been under the suzerainty of the Burmese Pagan Kingdom and Sri Lanka. At its height in the mid-13th century, under King Chandrabhanu, Tambralinga was independent, regrouping and consolidating its power and even invading its former suzerain Sri Lanka. By the end of the 13th century, Tambralinga was recorded in Siamese history as Nakhon Si Thammarat, under the suzerainty of the Tai Sukhothai Kingdom.  Tambralinga in records  The Chinese Songhuiyaogao chronicle mentions a country named Danliumei (Tan-liu-mei), stating many details during the period from 970 to 1070. It gives the impression that the kingdom was an independent state at that time, sending embassies to the court of China under the Song dynasty in 1001, 1016 and 1070. Danliumei is assumed to be a Chinese rendering of Tambralinga, the location of that state however is not precisely described. The chronicle of Ma Duanlin and the Songshi, mention similarly named states, Zhoumeiliu (Chou-mei-liu) and Danmeiliu (Tan-liu-mei) respectively, that are also reported to have sent their first mission to China in 1001, which makes it likely that they refer to the same state. In his 13th- century work Zhu Fan Zhi, Chinese historian Zhao Rugua mentions the state Danmaling (Tan-ma-ling, ), describing it as a vassal of Srivijaya. Whether Danmaling can be identified with Tambralinga is dubious; sinologist Roderich Ptak proposes instead to locate it in the Tembeling region of Pahang. An indigenous source of Tambralinga history is an inscription dating to 1183, written in Old Khmer, engraved on the base of a bronze Buddha statue found at Wat Hua Wiang in Chaiya District, Surat Thani Province. It gives an impression of the political situation of Tambralinga in the late-twelfth century. Another important source is a Sanskrit inscription ascribed to King Chandrabhanu of Tambralinga, dated 1230. It gives the king the epithet \\"≈örƒ´ DharmarƒÅja\\", which is an evidence for the identification of Tambralinga with Nakhon Si Thammarat (Nagara ≈örƒ´ DharmarƒÅja in Sanskrit).  Golden age  Chedi Phrae Boromadhatu According to the inscription no.24 found at Hua-wieng temple in Chaiya near to Nakhon Si Thammarat, the ruler of Tambralinga named Chandrabhanu Sridhamaraja was the king of Patama vamsa (lotus dynasty). He began to reign in 1230, he had the Phrae Boromadhatu (chedi in Nakhon Si Thammaraj, from Sanskrit dhatu - element, component, or relic + garbha - storehouse or repository) reparation and celebration in the same year. Chandrabhanu Sridhamaraja brought Tambralinga reached the pinnacle of its power in the mid-thirteenth century. From the Sri Lankan and Tamil materials, this Chandrabhanu was a Savakan king from Tambralinga who had invaded Sri Lanka in 1247. His navy launched an assault on the southern part of the island but was defeated by the Sri Lankan king. However Chandrabhanu was able to establish an independent regime in the north of the island over the Jaffna kingdom, but in 1258 he was attacked and subjugated by the south Indian Emperor Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan. He was compelled to pay a tribute to the Pandyan Dynasty of precious jewels and elephants. In 1262 Chandrabhanu launched another attack on the south of the island, his army strengthened this time by the addition of Tamil and Sinhalese forces, only to be defeated when Pandya sided with the Sri Lankan side; this time Jatarvarman Sundara Pandyan's brother Jatavarman Veera Pandyan intervened and Chandrabhanu himself was killed in the fighting. Chandrabhanu‚Äôs son Savakanmaindan inherited the throne and submitted to Veera Pandyan's rule, received rewards and retained control over the northern kingdom. His regime too had disappeared following Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I's ascension to the Pandyan empire's throne and another invasion of the island by the army of the Pandyan Dynasty in the late 1270s. Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I installed his minister in charge of the invasion, Kulasekara Cinkaiariyan, an Aryachakravarti as the new king of Jaffna. In at least two senses, the rapid expansion of Tambralinga is exceptional in the history of Southeast Asia. In the first place, Candrabhanu‚Äôs invasion of Sri Lanka and occupation of the Jaffna kingdom marks the only time that a Southeast Asian power has launched an overseas military expedition beyond the immediate Southeast Asian region. In the second place, in the historiography of Southeast Asia the southern Thailand has generally played a secondary role to that of places like Java, the Malacca Strait region (Srivijaya in the seventh~eighth century, Melaka in the fifteenth century), Cambodia, Champa, Vietnam, and Burma. Tambralinga‚Äôs sudden appearance on centre-stage in the thirteenth century was thus highly unusual.  Decline  By the end of the fourteenth century, Tambralinga had been submerged by the Sumatran Melayu Kingdom which had the backing of Java. Finally, in 1365 Majapahit Kingdom of Java recognized Nakorn Sri Dharmaraja as Dharmanagari written in Nagarakretagama. Despite its rapid rise to prominence in the thirteenth century, that is, by the following century Danmaling, or Tambralinga, the former member state of Sanfoshih ‚Äì Javaka, had become a part of Siam.  Heritage and restoration  Northern Gate The city chronicle already mentions a fortification when the town was refounded in 1278. The Ram Khamhaeng inscription of 1283 lists Nakhon Si Thammarat as one of the tributary kingdoms of Sukhothai. In the Old Javanese Desawarnana document of 1365, the Majapahit kingdom also recognised Nakhon Si Thammarat as belonging to Siam. In the Palatinate law of King Trailok dated 1468, Nakhon Si Thammarat was listed as one of eight great cities (Phraya maha nakhon) belonging to the Ayutthaya Kingdom. During the reign of King Naresuan (r. 1590‚Äì1605) it became a first class province (Mueang Ek). Restorations were recorded at the time of King Ramesuan (1388‚Äì95), as well as King Narai (1656‚Äì88) of Ayutthaya. The latter one was supported by the French engineer M. de la Mare. The walls spread 456 m from East to West, and 2238 m North to South, thus enclosing an area of about one square kilometre. The northern wall had only one gate, called Pratu Chai Nuea or Pratu Chai Sak, also the southern wall had only one gate. To the east there were three gates, which connected the town with the sea. To the west were five gates. Today only the northern gate still exists, together with a short stretch of the northern city wall.

New Delhi: Samskrita Bharati. Mission and motivations The basic mission of this organization is to democratize and popularize Sanskrit by encouraging the use of simple Sanskrit in everyday conversational contexts. More recently, the organization has started to focus on the maintenance of the \\"mother-tongue- ness\\" (‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•É‡§≠‡§æ‡§∑‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§Æ‡•ç) of Sanskrit by means of Sanskrit households.‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Æ‡•á‡§≤‡§®‡§∏‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡§ø‡§É ‡§¶‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§ø‡§£‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§‡•Ä‡§Ø‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ó‡•É‡§π‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Æ‡•á‡§≤‡§®‡§Æ‡•ç. Bangalore: BhƒÅratƒ´ Additionally, the primary impetus is on direct Sanskrit language instruction through Sanskrit itself as the medium of instruction. =Motivation= As its founder says, \\"Sanskrit is the best tool to remove the five types of social differences; linguistic, class, caste, sect and the north vs south division.\\"Licked by the Mother Tongue: Imagining Everyday Sanskrit at Home and in the World, Adi Hastings Journal of Linguistic Anthropology A basic goal is to create a nation of Sanskrit speakers, (re)creating a national unity for India through common linguistic practice. Another one of the main premises of the movement is to allow direct access to the vast storehouse of the Sanskrit textual tradition. Pedagogical principles The organization's pedagogical philosophy is based on the idea that listening and speaking must precede reading and writing. Rejecting both Western-style grammatical instruction (or more recent innovations) and Indian traditions of Sanskrit instruction emphasizing systematic memorization, Samskrita Bharati instead has focused its energies on immersion through conversation. A common aphorism used in their literature is: \\"Speak in Samskrit, not about Samskrit.\\" This follows a theory of linguistic practice which imagines a progression from the capacity for \\"general communication\\" (simple reference and predication), through the capacity for expressing thought or reasoning (logical argumentation), culminating in the capacity for the outward manifestation of emotions.‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§£‡§Æ‡•ç - ‡§ï‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡§∂‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§É ‡•ß‡•Ø‡•Ø‡•Ø =Simple Sanskrit Usage= To provide a gentler introduction to Sanskrit, Samskrita Bharati has developed a simple and effective method of Sanskrit instruction through Sanskrit. Initial instruction is on simple use of the language, which while conforming to Panini's grammar, focuses on the use of very regular forms for conversational purposes at initial stages. As Dr Hastings observes: > the \\"simple\\" of simple Sanskrit points to the fact that it is designed to > act as a bridge between the modern vernacular(s) a simple Sanskrit learner > already knows and, ideally, acquisition of the elaborated Classical Sanskrit > grammar... \\"simple Sanskrit\\" is a variety of the language which has been > subjected to what we could call distributional simplification. That is, > almost all of the differences between simple Sanskrit and Classical Sanskrit > are differences in the distribution of forms rather than grammatical\\". This form of simple use of language exists and is practiced in several languages in India. A news anchor, or a stage speaker, might for instance, construct sentences using advanced grammatical or literary phrases. These advanced constructions are found widely in literature, however, not required for day-to-day communication, and can be acquired and understood overtime. (Note that this is NOT the difference between colloquial and formal language). Simple use of Sanskrit is very much formal and grammatically accurate. Work SambhƒÅ·π£a·πáa Sande≈õa·∏• - the organization's official Sanskrit Magazine Samskrita Bharati is primarily a volunteer-driven organization, with volunteers from all walks of life spending time educating people to speak Sanskrit. Their most popular offering is the 10-day capsule of two-hour classes designed to impart simple Sanskrit conversational skills. Besides this, the organization conducts the following programs: * A two-week intense residential teaching program called Samvaadashala (‡§∏‡§Ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶‡§∂‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ), is conducted in New Delhi, India every summer. * Weekend camps and yearly residential camps as well in many parts of the US and India. * Development and publication of Simple Sanskrit books, tapes and CDs for learning practical conversations in Samskritam at various levels are developed systematically to allow new speakers to effectively use Sanskrit for conversations. * Publication of the ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§≠‡§æ‡§∑‡§£‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ magazine. * Distance learning programs or duurastha shikShaNam (‡§¶‡•Ç‡§∞‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§∂‡§ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§£‡§Æ‡•ç). * Sanskrit as a Foreign Language program for children in USA. * Competitions to encourage Sanskrit learning amongst children. =Effectiveness= Even as he acknowledges that \\"end of the ten days, the participants have a reasonable command of many basic features of (simple) Sanskrit and can formulate a wide variety of expressions.\\", Hastings notes: > While the Sanskrit conversation camps have garnered a great degree of public > visibility for the Sanskrit revival movement, they have not generated as > large and dedicated a following as Samskrita Bharati would hope. The > organization has a host of follow-up activities for graduates of the > introductory ten-day camps, but there is a substantial attrition rate after > initial exposure in the camps. Origin Chamu Krishna Shastry, a Sanskrit scholar from Tirupati Sanskrit College along with five of his colleagues, after graduating in Sanskrit, came up with a methodology of teaching spoken Sanskrit through the \\"Speak Samskritam\\" (called a SambhashanaShibiram) course with ten day capsule classes of two hours duration. Within a short span of time, this methodology became a trend blazer in the field of teaching Sanskritam. This \\"Speak Samskritam\\" Movement took off in 1981 from Bangalore city, and later \\"Samskrita Bharati\\" - a national level organization - was established in New Delhi in 1995.

Adaptive enemies and a more complex environment were seen as requiring conventional forces to maintain the ability to decentralize decision making and distribute their forces. The overarching goal of DO is to maximize a Marine Air Ground Task Force commander's ability to employ tactical units across the depth and breadth of a non-linear battlespace. Distributed Operations is a form of maneuver warfare where small, highly capable units spread across a large area of operations will create an advantage over an adversary through the deliberate use of separation and coordinated, independent tactical actions. DO units will use close combat or supporting arms to disrupt the enemy's access to key terrain and avenues of approach. This type of warfare will be dependent on well trained and professional small unit leaders, focused and energetic training of small units and more robust communications and tactical mobility assets for those smaller units. A greater focus will also be placed on language and cultural training. DO has two deployment modes; disburse and coalesce. In the disbursal mode distributed units spread out to find targets, gather intel, and secure lightly defended infrastructure. In Coalesce mode units coalesce to concentrate all of their firepower on large, heavily defended targets of opportunity, high value targets, perhaps with the aid of air and sea-based bombardment. The general model is that of an immune system. When a pathogen is located, the antibody attacks the pathogen, but not before messaging the body to send more resources to finish attack.

It is a subsidiary of Transdev Blazefield. Commencing in July 2016, the business is progressively being rebranded from Lancashire United. History Plaxton President bodied Volvo B7TL in Accrington in February 2008 In April 2001, Stagecoach sold its East Lancashire operations to the Blazefield Travel. Soon after the business was split in two. The Blackburn, Bolton, Clitheroe and Hyndburn became Lancashire United and the remainder Burnley & Pendle. Investment commenced in new vehicles almost immediately, with the first of 30 new Wright Renown bodied Volvo B10BLEs arriving in September 2001. A number of service revisions followed with many marginal services withdrawn and a number of school contracts were terminated. Much of this work, mainly contracted to Lancashire County Council, was picked up by Northern Blue. A focus was then made on developing high quality trunk routes, namely the 152, 225 & Hyndburn Circulars. Also later the X1. In 2002, the Bolton garage was sold on to independent operator Blue Bus. The contracted services in the Clitheroe area were relinquished and the garage was sold to a housing developer. Most of the Clitheroe contracted work passed to Northern Blue. In January 2006, Lancashire United was included in the sale of Blazefield Travel to Transdev.Transdev acquires Blazefield Group Bus & Coach Professional 7 January 2006A new stop for Blazefield Yorkshire Post 9 January 2006 Unlike the other Transdev Blazefield subsidiaries it retained its pre-acquisition trading name.

In March 2008, Lancashire United took over the Accrington local bus network from Accrington Transport. This resulted in Clitheroe services being reacquired by Lancashire United for a second time through the Northern Blue takeover, however these ceased to be operated in June 2008.

Hyndburn Circular This was a circular service that connected Blackburn with the towns of Rishton, Clayton-le-Moors, Great Harwood, Oswaldtwistle and Accrington in the district of Hyndburn. The service was taken over from Stagecoach Ribble's Blackburn depot in 2001 and shortly after a brand new fleet were purchased and carried branding for this service. From May 2007 the service was part of the Spot On network. September 2013 saw the routes rebranded as The Hyndburn Connect The Outer Circle The Blackburn Outer Circle was a circular service that connected schools, hospitals and leisure opportunities around the edge of the town. It was started by Blackburn Borough Transport in 1980 as the 50 (clockwise) and the 51 (anticlockwise). The Transport Department did not register the service for commercial operation, and after deregulation, it became one of several routes in the area won by GM Buses on a nil tender basis. GM Buses found out that these services were not as profitable as they had imagined and pulled out of the area entirely, on 26 January 1987 the route was returned to Blackburn Transport, who re-instated Leyland Atlantean double-deckers to operate the service. At the next round of tenders, the services passed to Ribble, who operated it using Leyland Olympians from Preston's Frenchwood garage. The route again reverted to Blackburn Transport using Optare Metroriders, the route was then renumbered as Track 5 with an A or C suffix denoting direction of travel. In March 2006 the route became the OC and used Volvo Olympians which received a purple and orange livery with route branding, the vehicles and branding were retained on takeover by Lancashire United. As of August 2016 this route no longer operates due to budget cuts by Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council. The Hyndburn Connect Launched on 2 September 2013, Hyndburn Circular services 6 and 7 that link Blackburn with Oswaldtwistle, Accrington, Clayton-Le-Moors, Great Harwood and Rishton, a new Hyndburn Connect ticket was also introduced to replace the Spot On Hyndburn ticket and buses received branding for this service The X1 The X1 was a semi-express route linking Clitheroe, Whalley and Accrington with Manchester. The route was for a time operated by a fleet of route branded Volvo Olympians and won a number of awards. The X1 and associated X2 were replaced with the X40/X41 service running between Blackburn, Accrington and Manchester. Route 241 was created for passengers between Clitheroe and Accrington, however this route has since passed in and out of the company's control a number of times and now no longer runs. A very limited number of journeys still commenced at Great Harwood. The Lancashire Way Replaced by the Red Express and Hotline brands in 2016. This was first introduced to complement the Witch Way branding for route X40/X41 from Manchester to Blackburn/Great Harwood/Whalley via Accrington. Originally using buses in a black and red livery with a Lancashire Rose. For a time buses on route 152 also used this branding. Then later using Yellow and blue Wright Eclipse Geminis. In 2016 the more rural Whalley and Great Harwood journeys were axed in favour of the urban Blackburn, Accrington, Haslingden, Prestwich, Manchester service. The Whalley Ranger This service was introduced in late 2009 following customer requests after two years of the Whalley Range area being unserved by bus. The route used specially branded buses and operated every 10 minutes with a flat single fare of ¬£1, on 14 June 2010 the service was extended to serve Openshaw Drive to replace Spot On route 24, with the frequency reduced to every 15 minutes and period tickets became valid. It was announced on 16 November 2010 that this service was to be withdrawn due to low patronage, the last service operated on 24 December 2010. Route 124 This route was renumbered '2' on 2 September 2013 and operated as a through service from Chorley to Blackburn, Blackburn Hospital and Darwen. From March 2014 the Blackburn to Chorley section was once again split from the Darwen section. The service running as route 24. Route 225 Route 225 was a long established route which ran from Clitheroe to Bolton via Whalley, Blackburn & Darwen. The route was taken over from Stagecoach Ribble in 2001 and a new fleet of route branded low floor buses operated it. As of 16 September 2012 this route was divided into two separate services with all buses now terminating in Blackburn town centre. The Blackburn to Clitheroe section being renumbered as Route 22 and the Blackburn to Bolton section became Route 1 which has subsequently replaced Spot On 1. Spot On Following the acquisition of Blackburn Transport, both its services and Lancashire United's Hyndburn Circular routes were combined and branded as 'Spot On', the service was launched on 14 May 2007 with a fleet of 25 brand new single deck buses .Transport Company's Change Of Name (from Lancashire Telegraph)\\"Spot On Timetables\\" As of July 2014 the brand have been dropped with the remaining services which operated under the former 'Spot On' brand now operate under the 'Lancashire United' brand.. =Spot on 1= As of 16 September 2012 this route was divided into two separate services replacing the Spot On branding from this route, renumbered as Route 41 to operate alongside the X41 between Blackburn and Accrington with the Blackburn to Darwen section becoming Route 1. Contract services On 2 April 2011, Lancashire United lost the contract to routes C1 and 241. 2014 saw the loss of service 39 which has been handed over to several operators. Fleet Eastern Coach Works bodied Leyland Olympian in Lancashire United's school bus livery in Darwen Spot On branded Wright Renown bodied Volvo B10BLE in Chorley in March 2013 =Fleet history= When Lancashire United took over Stagecoach Ribble in April 2001, the fleet was predominantly made up of aging buses. These included double-decker models such as Bristol VRs and Leyland Atlanteans and single-decker models such as Leyland Lynxs and Leyland Nationals. The new company also inherited a couple of Plaxton Pointer bodied Dennis Darts and Mercedes-Benz Vario minibuses at the Clitheroe depot. By September 2001, most of these had been replaced by more modern Leyland Olympians, more Leyland Lynxs and the first of 30 new Wright Renown bodied Volvo B10BLEs. Whilst the Leyland Olympians and Volvo B10BLEs remained with the company for years, other models were bought and sold, mainly middle aged versions at the time. Included were Dennis Darts, Volvo Olympians and some other Volvo single-deckers, many cascaded from Blazefield's other operations in Yorkshire. In 2007, Lancashire United took delivery of 25 Wright Eclipse bodied Volvo B7RLEs, these were painted in a white and sandy gold livery, with purple Spot On brandings for routes 6 and 7 and a deeper shade of purple for route 1. These were originally destined for Burnley & Pendle, but due to the acquisition of Blackburn Transport they were diverted to Lancashire United.The other word isn't offOmnibuses.blogsot.com 14 May 2007 In July 2016, a batch of new Optare Versas carrying Blackburn Bus Company branding in a two tone blue livery and operate on the currently branded Hyndburn Connect 6 and 7 routes.

In September 2010 following the introduction of the new eight Optare Tempos, the interurban fleet received the new Lancashire United livery of blue and yellow with most buses receiving route branding. In August 2016 the company was branded as The Blackburn Bus Company as part of the rebranding of Blazefield companies, a new batch of 18 Optare Versas were the first to wear this new livery. * The Blackburn Bus Company - This new livery consists of a two tone blue with branding replacing the current Lancashire United livery, the first new buses to wear this livery featured 6 & 7 branding. * Hotline - Two tone Purple with route branding and advertisements for the Preston to Burnley via Blackburn service. * School buses - Older double-decker buses used on school and college services carry an all-yellow livery scheme. * Eclipse Driver Training - white with blue and yellow stripes * Red Express - brand identity for the X41 between Blackburn, Accrington and Manchester, predominant blue with a diagonal red front. * Valley Line - New brand identity for the 22 between Shadsworth, Blackburn, Whalley & Clitheroe, predominantly blue with a diagonal yellow front. =Former liveries= A small number of double-deckers inherited from the former Blackburn Transport operations still retained the old two-tone green and cream livery and the green and yellow Schools+ livery while two still wore the purple and orange Outer Circle livery. * Lancashire United - This new style livery consists of yellow and blue with a distinctive red rose swooping up along the curve, the livery also carries a new Lancashire United logo, The new Optare Tempos were the first to carry this livery with route branding for route 225, the fleet was standardized into this livery replacing both the Spot On and The Lancashire Way liveries.

The Paramount Compton Organ has been recently rebuilt, and was the reason why the cinema was renamed from the Metro Cinema. The Compton Organ was built in 1937 by the John Compton Organ Company in London, especially for the Paramount Theatre in Birmingham. Compton Organ The organ was removed from there in 1988 when the cinema was refurbished and made into a multiplex. It was then moved to the Regal in Oswestry, where it stayed until the cinema closed in 1994. In 2000 The Penistone Cinema Organ Trust purchased the organ, and all of the 1000 pipes were cleaned out as part of the organ restoration. The trust then made an agreement with the council for the organ to be based there. The cinema was then renamed as the Paramount in honour of the new resident. The building itself remains the property of Barnsley Metropolitan District Council, and is leased back to Penistone Town Council to keep it open as a cinema. The cinema was featured on the BBC Politics Show as an example of how a small provincial community cinema can survive.

It marks the transfer of the islands from Denmark to the United States that took place in 1917. The islands were initially held by various European countries, and would be under the sole control of Denmark in 1754. Transfer Day could have potentially been years earlier, but due to the construction and funding of the Panama Canal, the United States Senate rejected negotiations. Following money shortages from war and potential German invasion on Denmark, both sides saw the exchange as mutually beneficial. Transfer Day is now celebrated in a variety of ways on the various islands including parades, parties, and reenactment of the original Transfer Day itself. The holiday is the subject of Sophie Schiller's 2012 novel Transfer Day.International Standard Book Number: .  Danish control  The Virgin Islands were exploited by numerous European countries after Christopher Columbus discovered the islands in 1493, land previously unknown to the East. The Virgin Islands and the natives were subject to the negative externalities of imperialism and colonialism. A number of European countries occupied the Virgin Islands including France, Britain, Spain, and most importantly Denmark. While all of the countries listed exploited the VI in some form, Denmark had the most impact due to their control over the islands. After gaining full control of the islands in 1754, purchased from the Danish West Indian Company, the Danish began to exploit the land by setting up a sugar industry. This sugar industry also used slave labor to increase production. When the sugar industry became less profitable, \\"the Danish West Indies continued throughout the 19th century to enjoy a commercial boom as a free port and as a coaling station in the days of sailing vessels and paddle steamers.\\"  Transfer Day  The Virgin Islands were of long interest of the United States, \\"‚Ä¶but as far back as the Civil War the U.S. was aware of their value as a possible U.S. Naval depot, commanding as they do the most important sea approaches from the Atlantic to the Caribbean\\". Following the decline of the sugar industry, the Danish began to have interest in selling the islands, but the United States senate was disinterested in the deal because of the building of the Panama Canal which significantly affect global trade and specifically United States Trade. Years later, there was mutual interest due to the fact that Denmark was struggling financially from war with Prussia and Austria, the United States had interest because Denmark was under threat of German invasion which caused fear that the Germans would then inhabit the Virgin Islands. In January of 1917, the United States would agree to purchase the Virgin Islands for \\"$25 million ($295 per acre), then regarded as an exorbitant sum for land that amounted to hardly more than a tenth of the size of Rhode Island, the smallest state.\\". The first Transfer Day celebration/ceremony occurred on March 31, 1917. The news was immediately telegraphed to New York, then cabled to San Juan, Puerto Rico, flashed by wireless to the cruiser Hancock in the harbor at Charlotte Amalie, and carried ashore to St. Thomas via rowboat. There, Danish and American honor guards in white uniforms stood in formation on opposite sides of the parade ground before red-walled Fort Christian. Once the message had been delivered, at 4:48 p.m, the Danish honor guard presented arms, the Danish national anthem was played, and a cannon boomed 21 times as the red and white Danish flag was slowly lowered for the final time after 251 years of Danish rule. At 4:53 p.m. the American honor guard presented arms, a band played the \\"Star-Spangled Banner,\\" and to the roar of the cannon the American flag was raised. As a last gesture, Admiral Henri Konow of Denmark and Admiral Edwin T. Pollock of the United States Navy drew their ceremonial swords. The Virgin Islands now have annual celebrations in honor of transfer day. According to a St. Croix website, \\"Transfer Day is commemorated annually with a military parade and various ceremonies and cultural events across all of the islands\\". The celebration varies by year, for example in 1987, \\"A reenactment of the transfer will begin at 4 p.m. Tuesday on the lawns of the 1874 lime- green, white-shuttered Legislature building. That's the precise time the event originally occurred on March 31, 1917\\". In addition to reenacting the transfer, the Danish also replicated their departure, \\"The 196-foot-long, three-masted, full-rigged Danish government training ship Danmark has sailed here from Copenhagen especially for the celebration. The Danmark 80 cadets and 18 officers will represent the officers and crew of the Danish cruiser Valkyrien which in 1917 carried back to Denmark the last Danish governor and his official party\\".  Key actors  Constantin Brun, a Danish royal administrator and merchant, was in Washington D.C. on Transfer Day as representative of Denmark accepting payment for the Virgin Islands on behalf of the acting President Woodrow Wilson. Following payment, various telegraphs were sent to the islands in order to inform them of the sale. As mentioned previously, a final act of respect would be displayed by Admiral Henri Konow of Denmark and Admiral Edwin T. Pollock of the United States Navy.

The effect of a duplex mismatch is a link that operates inefficiently. Duplex mismatch may be caused by manually setting two connected network interfaces at different duplex modes or by connecting a device that performs autonegotiation to one that is manually set to a full duplex mode.  Duplex mismatch due to autonegotiation  When a device set to autonegotiation is connected to a device that is not using autonegotiation, the autonegotiation process fails. The autonegotiating end of the connection is still able to correctly detect the speed of the other end, but cannot correctly detect the duplex mode. For backwards compatibility with Ethernet hubs, the standard requires the autonegotiating device to use half duplex in these conditions. Therefore, the autonegotiating end of the connection uses half duplex while the non- negotiating peer is locked at full duplex, and this is a duplex mismatch. The Ethernet standards and major Ethernet equipment manufacturers recommend enabling autonegotiation. Nevertheless, network equipment allows autonegotiation to be disabled and on some networks, autonegotiation is disabled on all ports and a fixed modality of 100 Mbit/s and full duplex is used. That was often done by network administrators intentionally upon the introduction of autonegotiation, because of interoperability issues with the initial autonegotiation specification. The fixed mode of operation works well if both ends of a connection are locked to the same settings. However, maintaining such a network and guaranteeing consistency is difficult. Since autonegotiation is generally the manufacturer‚Äôs default setting it is almost certain that, in an environment where the policy is to have fixed port settings, someone will sooner or later leave a port set to use autonegotiation by mistake.  Effects of duplex mismatch  Communication is possible over a connection in spite of a duplex mismatch. Single packets are sent and acknowledged without problems. As a result, a simple ping command fails to detect a duplex mismatch because single packets and their resulting acknowledgments at 1-second intervals do not cause any problem on the network. A terminal session which sends data slowly (in very short bursts) can also communicate successfully. However, as soon as either end of the connection attempts to send any significant amount of data, the network suddenly slows to very low speed. Since the network is otherwise working, the cause is not so readily apparent. A duplex mismatch causes problems when both ends of the connection attempt to transfer data at the same time. This happens even if the channel is used (from a high-level or user's perspective) in one direction only, in case of large data transfers. Indeed, when a large data transfer is sent over a TCP, data is sent in multiple packets, some of which will trigger an acknowledgment packet back to the sender. This results in packets being sent in both directions at the same time. In such conditions, the full-duplex end of the connection sends its packets while receiving other packets; this is exactly the point of a full-duplex connection. Meanwhile, the half-duplex end cannot accept the incoming data while it is sending ‚Äì it will sense it as a collision. The half-duplex device ceases its current data transmission, sends a jam signal instead and then retries later as per CSMA/CD. This results in the full-duplex side receiving an incomplete frame with CRC error or a runt frame. It does not detect any collision since CSMA/CD is disabled on the full- duplex side. As a result, when both devices are attempting to transmit at (nearly) the same time, the packet sent by the full-duplex end will be discarded and lost due to an assumed collision and the packet sent by the half duplex device will be delayed or lost due to a CRC error in the frame. The lost packets force the TCP protocol to perform error recovery, but the initial (streamlined) recovery attempts fail because the retransmitted packets are lost in exactly the same way as the original packets. Eventually, the TCP transmission window becomes full and the TCP protocol refuses to transmit any further data until the previously-transmitted data is acknowledged. This, in turn, will quiesce the new traffic over the connection, leaving only the retransmissions and acknowledgments. Since the retransmission timer grows progressively longer between attempts, eventually a retransmission will occur when there is no reverse traffic on the connection, and the acknowledgment are finally received. This will restart the TCP traffic, which in turn immediately causes lost packets as streaming resumes. The end result is a connection that is working but performs extremely poorly because of the duplex mismatch. Symptoms of a duplex mismatch are connections that seem to work fine with a ping command, but \\"lock up\\" easily with very low throughput on data transfers; the effective data transfer rate is likely to be asymmetrical, performing much worse in the half-duplex to full-duplex direction than the other. In normal half-duplex operations late collisions do not occur. However, in a duplex mismatch the collisions seen on the half-duplex side of the link are often late collisions. The full-duplex side usually will register frame check sequence errors, or runt frames. Viewing these standard Ethernet statistics can help diagnose the problem. Contrary to what one might reasonably expect, both sides of a connection need to be identically configured for proper operation. In other words, setting one side to automatic (either speed or duplex or both) and setting the other to be fixed (either speed or duplex or both) will likely result in either a speed mismatch, a duplex mismatch or both. A duplex mismatch can be fixed by either enabling autonegotiation (if available and working) on both ends or by forcing the same settings on both ends (availability of a configuration interface permitting). If there is no option but to have a locked setting on one end and autonegotiation the other (for example, an old device with broken autonegotiation connected to an unmanaged switch) half duplex must be used. All modern LAN equipment comes with autonegotiation enabled and the various compatibility issues have been resolved. The best way to avoid duplex mismatches is to use autonegotiation and to replace any legacy equipment that does not use autonegotiation or does not autonegotiate correctly.

While in high school in 1948, she studied under Clair Omar Musser at Northwestern University and was a member of his marimba orchestra, which performed in Chicago in 1948. Chenoweth also studied composition and wrote pieces for marimba. She attended William Woods College in Missouri, transferring to Northwestern for her final two years of study and emerged with a double degree in music criticism and marimba performance. For graduate school, Chenoweth attended the American Conservatory in Chicago from 1952 to 1953, where she studied pedagogy of music theory, and canon and fugue with Stella Roberts, a pupil of Nadia Boulanger, and earned a double degree in music theory and percussion. Music career Chenoweth made her solo debut in Chicago in 1956, followed by a successful recital in New York and numerous other concerts around the world. In 1959 she premiered the Concerto for Marimba composed for her by Robert Kurka, and in 1961, she performed Paul Creston's Concertino for Marimba, both with the Orchestra of America conducted by Richard Korn. She was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 1994. As linguist and ethnomusicologist In 1961 she nearly lost the fingers of her right hand in a gas oven explosion which left her hand severely burned. Unable to regain complete freedom of movement, she turned her attention toward linguistics and ethnomusicology. She went to the Territory of New Guinea and served for thirteen years with Wycliffe Bible Translators as a linguist and Bible translator. There, with colleague Darlene Bee, she lived with the Usarufa tribe and learned their unwritten language. After Dr. Bee‚Äôs death, she completed a translation of the New Testament in Usarufa. Meanwhile, she studied the music of the Usarufas and many other tribes and became internationally known as a scholar who pioneered a new method of ethnic music analysis. She authored eleven books, including her textbooks Melodic Perception and Analysis and The Usarufas and Their Music, and numerous articles on the validity of oral music traditions throughout the world. She then developed a program in ethnomusicology for the Wheaton College Conservatory of Music based on her own theory of analyzing the music of unwritten music traditions. She has since retired as International Consultant for Wycliffe and as Professor of Ethnomusicology at Wheaton College and has archived her nearly 1000 field tapes of world music in the Library of Congress. In 1974 she earned a Ph.D. in ethnomusicology at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.

The MFF oversees the Burmese men's national team, the women's national team, and youth national teams as well as national football championships and professional club competitions. Headquarters History Reportedly introduced during the British colonial era by James George Scott, a British colonial administrator, football has been the most popular sport in the country. The Burma Football Federation was founded in 1947, a year before the country's independence from the United Kingdom. The BFF joined FIFA in 1952, and the AFC in 1954. The federation launched the first States and Divisions Football Championship in 1952. The highly popular annual competition became the main venue from which to draw out talented players from around the country. This rudimentary level of talent development seemed sufficient for a while. Burma was a top Asian football power, along with Iran and South Korea, in the 1960s and early 1970s, winning two Asian Games tournaments (1966, 1970) and then unprecedented five South East Asian Games tournaments (1965-1973) as well as coming in second in the 1968 Asian Cup tournament. During a ten-year span between 1961 and 1970, Burma thoroughly dominated the U-19/U-20 Asian Cup, reaching the finals nine times and winning the tournament seven times. Starting from the mid-1970s, the country's football success‚Äîa source of much national pride‚Äîalso declined rapidly, along with the country's precipitous economic decline. (Aside from a few regional tournament wins, the Burmese men's national team has not won any major football competition since 1973.) The federation did (or could do) little to promote development of football, or nurture the talent through professional league competitions. Until 1996, the country's main football league consisted of Yangon-based clubs run by government ministries and known for corruption. Although private football clubs were allowed to join the Myanmar Premier League in 1996, the league still did not attract much following by Burmese public. In December 2008, the MFF announced the formation a new national professional league, Myanmar National League, which will start its first full season in 2010. In accordance with FIFA regulations, the MFF reportedly became an independent organization, free of government control, in March 2009. Competitions run by the MFF * Myanmar National League * MNL-2 * General Aung San Shield * Myanmar Women League  Programmes  Together with Youri Djorkaeff, Aung San Suu Kyi meets the school kids at FIFA Football For Schools launching ceremony. The MFF has launched the FIFA Football for Schools project with the support of the FIFA Foundation on 31st January 2020. The event, hosted by MFF President Zaw Zaw, was attended by the State Counsellor H. E. Aung San Suu Kyi, Union Minister for the Health and Sports Dr. Myint Htwe, Union Minister for Education Dr. Myo Thein Gyi, FIFA Foundation CEO Youri Djorkaeff, together with guests, presidents and secretaries from local township football associations.  Sponsorships  Since 2013, 100PLUS has been the sponsor of MFF and Myanmar National League. 100PLUS' sponsorship is extended to 2020 to support major football events in the country, the various football teams within the national setup, football tournaments for youth development and the local professional competitions.

Overview Iravi Kuttipillai belonged to the Valiya Veedu Nair family of Keralapuram in Kalkulam,Travancore now in the Kanyakumari District of Tamil Nadu. His mother was Easvari pillai. Kuzhikkottu Paduvilakathu Kochu Narayana Pillai was his Guru in warfare. He became a minister under the King Unni Kerala Varma of Venad. During his time, Madurai Thirumala Naickar attacked Venad. Pillai was asked to lead the Venad army and the attack which was spearheaded by Velayyan was repulsed. As a reward, Iravikkutti Pillai was appointed the Chief Minister and the Commander-in-Chief of Venad. But Thirumala Naickar sent another army under the leadership of Ramappayyan to attack Venad. The battle at Kaniyamkulam near Nagercoil was decisive. Some army commanders betrayed the Venad army out of jealousy towards Pillai and the Madurai army defeated the Venad army. Iravikkutti Pillai was killed in the battle. This incident became the theme for the folk song for the Villadichan Paattu ‚ÄòKaniyakulathu Poru‚Äô in the local Malayalam dialect. This song describes the life history of Iravikkutti Pillai and his trusted disciple Thengapattanath Kunjirakottu Kaali Nair. His cemetery was near Keralapuram Siva temple close to his ancestral house. There is also have Bhadra kali temple which is called as Padathalavan Bhadrakali Temple.

SPM is responsible for the edition of scientific journal Portugali√¶ Mathematica, Boletim SPM, Gazeta de Matem√°tica and several books. Its activities include the organization of congresses, conferences, scientific meetings and training courses for teachers. SPM organizes the Portuguese Mathematical Olympiad and it also promotes the television show \\"This is mathematics\\", broadcast on SIC Not√≠cias and SIC International. It brings together teachers and math researchers interested in the progress of the discipline in the country. History The 1930s and 1940s have been special decades for Mathematics in Portugal. A generation of brilliant mathematicians such as Bento de Jesus Cara√ßa, Ruy Lu√≠s Gomes, Alfredo Pereira Gomes, Ant√≥nio Aniceto Monteiro and Hugo Ribeiro, among others, gave a new life to mathematics research in the country. They have successfully promoted several projects, including the scientific journal Portugali√¶ Mathematica (1937), the Mathematical Seminar in Lisbon (1938), the Center of Mathematical Studies Applied to Economics (1938), the magazine Gazeta de Matem√°tica (1939) and the Mathematical Studies Center in Lisbon and Oporto (1940 and 1942, respectively). It was in this context that on 12 December 1940, the Portuguese Mathematical Society (SPM) was founded. The first board of directors was constituted by Pedro Jos√© da Cunha (President), Victor Hugo Duarte Lemos (Vice President), Ant√≥nio Aniceto Monteiro (General Secretary), Manuel Zaluar Nunes (Treasurer), Maria Pilar Baptista Ribeiro and Augusto S√° da Costa (1st and 2nd Secretaries). Ruy Lu√≠s Gomes and Bento de Jesus Caraga were also key pieces in the development of the Society, which has gathered a considerable number of members from the beginning. But since its creation the Society has faced many difficulties due to the political events occurred during the 20th century in Portugal. The dictatorial regime didn't allow the registration of SPM, which was legalized only after the revolution of 1974, in October 10 of 1977 - almost 40 years after its foundation. During the regime mathematicians and scientists in general have been persecuted, and in 1945 Ant√≥nio Aniceto Monteiro was forced to leave the country. In 1946 and 1947 the government has unleashed an offensive against the Universities, preventing Bento de Jesus Cara√ßa, Ruy Lu√≠s Gomes, Zaluar Nunes, Hugo Ribeiro, Alfredo Pereira Gomes, among others, from pursuing their careers. The Mathematics centers were virtually extinct and the Mathematics Clubs, created by SPM, were declared illegal and banned. The Portuguese Mathematical Society was prevented from holding its normal meetings because gatherings of many people displeased the political authorities. Moreover, it was forbidden to elect another committee. Pressured by PIDE- the political police - many founding members of SPM departed into exile and the Society activity declined. Although some magazines have remained - such as Portugali√¶ Mathematica, thanks to Zaluar Nunes efforts, and Gazeta de Matem√°tica, thanks to Gaspar Teixeira - Mathematics in Portugal entered a numbness period. Despite these almost impossible circumstances the Portuguese Mathematical Society did manage to avoid total extinction, although it could not function in any meaningful way. Only after the revolution of April 25, 1974, SPM was able to fully work and achieve the objectives set by its founders: to promote mathematical knowledge and the quality of mathematics teaching and to disseminate the Portuguese mathematical research. Portugaliae Mathematica had been published since 1939 and continued to be published through the years when the Society could not function. However, with the Society flourishing again, it took over control of the journal. The Society took on its role of organising meetings and conferences and began to organize Olympiad competitions in 1980. In 1989, Portugal participated in the International Mathematics Olympiad competition for the first time.

Campus building subsequent to closure. The Lyman School for Boys was established by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts about 1886 and was closed in 1971. It was the first reform school, or training school in the United States, replacing the State Reform School for Boys near the same site, which was opened in 1848. The school was named for its principal benefactor, Theodore Lyman, who had been a mayor of Boston, Massachusetts in 1834 and a philanthropist. Lyman School is not used for its original purpose today but remains a nationally registered historic place. Location and changing economy Lyman School was situated near Lake Chauncy in the town of Westborough, on Powder Hill, off State Route 9. It comprised about one thousand acres (4 km¬≤) of which about five hundred acres (2 km¬≤) were prime farmland, maintained by its students. The farm remained a principal means of support for the school until about 1955 when the economy of the region became predominantly industrial rather than agricultural due to the placement of major companies along State Route 9. At that time training of the students was changed to adapt to the new economy. Population established by courts Students were sent to the Lyman School when the courts had determined that it would be in the public interest. Until about 1970, juveniles in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts were afforded none of the (now) commonly accepted Constitutional rights. Therefore, many boys were sent to this reform school for \\"crimes\\" such as truancy and being a stubborn child. In fact, an ancient law in the Commonwealth allowed stubborn children to be put to death. It remained on the books even though it was never ostensibly invoked. Several famous criminals attended the Lyman School, one of them being the Boston Strangler, Albert DeSalvo. Cottage system of administration Worcester/Westview CottageStudents at the school were subject to strict discipline. They were required to conform at all times to rules that were enforced with corporal punishment. Students lived in so-called cottages. These were large brick buildings providing shelter for about 100 boys in each. The top floor comprised a dormitory and the lower floors, the living space. Each cottage was ruled by a cottage master and usually a cottage matron. This husband-and-wife team lived in a cottage apartment and was on duty 24 hours a day. In the late 1950s, it became difficult to find cottage parents willing to work such long hours, so several changes were made. Doctoral dissertation. The cottages were named for towns or places of geographical importance. In the 1950 to 1960 era, the cottages were Lyman Hall, Chauncey, Overlook, Sunset, Hillside, Wachusett, Worcester, Elms, and Oak. Lyman Hall was the induction center for all new students. Oak Cottage was the discipline cottage. Runaways, troublemakers, and returnees were put there for attitude adjustment. Residents were usually graded according to age. The youngest boys lived in Chauncey Cottage and the oldest in Elms Cottage. The photograph of this subsection shows a typical cottage. This large building comprised Worcester and Westview. Worcester and Wachusett cottages share the same building. Religious education The Lyman School auditorium and churchReligious education was required. Each boy was supplied a suit of clothes that he wore to religious services on Sunday. Any boy who was not Catholic was assumed Protestant. The auditorium used for church services was also used for the showing of movies on Saturday afternoon. Watching movies was one of the privileges that could be revoked for maintaining order and discipline. Society at the school Two authors are known to have attended the Lyman School and gone on to write about it. They are Mark D. Devlin, the author of Stubborn Child, who died in 2005, and Richard B. Johnson, author of Abominable Firebug, who writes considerable details about students' daily activities at the school. The Lyman School was a nearly complete town in itself. It looked like a college campus. All of the maintenance, construction, and repair of the facilities were performed by its students. They were supervised by trade masters. A student attending the Lyman School would learn a trade whether he wanted to or not. It was not optional. The trades taught were grounds-keeping, laundry, cooking and other cafeteria skills, carpentry, painting, masonry, janitorial work, electrical work, plumbing and steam-fitting, boiler maintenance, and printing. The entire official corpus of printed documents of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and all the government stationery, were printed in the Lyman School print shop. The Lyman School for Boys has a less than pacific social history ranging from its nearly complete destruction by arson in its early years to runaways who were never caught nor heard from again. Institutional folklore had it that missing runaways were not runaways at all, but children killed by the cottage or trade masters, with their bodies buried in the swamps behind the hill. Attendee total Approximately three hundred boys \\"graduated\\" from the Lyman School for Boys every year. Sherrie Connelly project During the 1960s, college students from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, including Ted Todd, regularly visited boys at Lyman School. In the fall of 1964, Sherrie Connelly, then a student at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, visited the school with Todd and developed a Christmas project involving about 100 college students who sent Christmas cards and gifts to boys at Lyman School. One of the boys Sherrie got to know was a sweet and appreciative boy, who had L*O*V*E tattooed on his fingers. Many boys were very appreciative of visits, gifts and cards, and some correspondences developed. Connelly later conducted a project for a college organization behavior class studying the school from the perspectives of people in different roles at the school. Not surprisingly, in retrospect, people in different roles had very different ideas about the success of the school depending on their responsibilities as dorm parents, cafeteria workers, teachers or administrators. Closure During the administration of Governor Endicott Peabody (1962‚Äì1965), various trade unions complained that maintenance of state-owned buildings at the Lyman School was being performed by non-union labor. If the trade unions were to have their way, the cost to the Commonwealth to maintain each student at the institution would increase from about five thousand to fifty thousand dollars per year. The institution was closed in 1971 by the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services just two years after Governor Francis Sargent appointed Jerome G. Miller as its Commissioner. Miller's Last One Over the Wall describes his involvement in the institution's closing.

At the time, it was the administrative center of Pustoshkinskaya Volost of Sebezhsky Uyezd in Pskov Governorate. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds and governorates were abolished and Pustoshkinsky District, with the administrative center in Pustoshka, was established as a part of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Leningrad Oblast.Administrative-Territorial Structure of Pskov Oblast, pp. 11‚Äì16 It included parts of former Nevelsky, Opochetsky, and Sebezhsky Uyezds. On June 3, 1929, Pustoshkinsky District was transferred to Western Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were also abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 29, 1935, Western Oblast was abolished and the district was transferred to Kalinin Oblast, and on February 5 of the same year, Pustoshkinsky District became a part of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Kalinin Oblast, one of the okrugs abutting the state boundaries of the Soviet Union. On May 4, 1938, the district was transferred to Opochka Okrug. On February 5, 1941, the okrug was abolished. Between July 16, 1941 and February 27, 1944, Pustoshka was occupied by German troops. On August 22, 1944, the district was transferred to newly established Velikiye Luki Oblast. On October 2, 1957, Velikiye Luki Oblast was abolished and Pustoshkinsky District was transferred to Pskov Oblast. The district was abolished on February 1, 1963 but reinstated on January 12, 1965. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Pustoshka serves as the administrative center of Pustoshkinsky District, to which it is directly subordinated.Law #833-oz stipulates that the borders of the administrative districts are identical to the borders of the municipal districts. The Law #420-oz, which describes the borders and the composition of the municipal districts, lists the town of Pustoshka as a part of Pustoshkinsky District. As a municipal division, the town of Pustoshka is incorporated within Pustoshkinsky Municipal District as Pustoshka Urban Settlement.Law #420-oz Economy =Industry= The biggest industrial enterprise is the milk production factory. =Transportation= The railway connecting Moscow and Riga passes Pustoshka. There are two significant highways crossing close to the town. The M9 Highway, which connects Moscow and Riga, runs in the east‚Äìwest direction, whereas the M20 Highway connects St. Petersburg and Kiev, running from north to south. There are also local roads. Culture and recreation Pustoshka contains one cultural heritage monument of federal significance and additionally three objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance.

They are the main source of federal aid to state and local governments and can be used only for specified categories of state and local spending, such as education or roads. These grants have been accompanying rules and guidelines that constrain the recipient government in the use of grant funds. Categorical grants are intended to help states improve the overall well-being of their residents, but also empower the federal government to exert more power over the states within a specific policy area.  Types of federal funding  The United States federal government gives financial assistance to states, local governments, and other entities. They are defined and governed by the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977, as incorporated in Title 31 Section 6304 of the U.S. Code. A Federal grant is a: > \\"...legal instrument reflecting the relationship between the United States > Government and a State, a local government, or other entity when 1) the > principal purpose of the relationship is to transfer a thing of value to the > State or local government or other recipient to carry out a public purpose > of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the United States instead > of acquiring (by purchase, lease, or barter) property or services for the > direct benefit or use of the United States Government; and 2) substantial > involvement is not expected between the executive agency and the State, > local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity > contemplated in the agreement.‚Äù Federal agencies offer more than a thousand grant programs each year. Federal grants are mainly categorized into block grants and categorical grants. Block grants are not project-specific and have much broader range of uses within a concern.  Categorical grant distribution  The way categorical grants are distributed is either through project grants or formula grants. = Project grant funding = Project grant funding is given to help subsidize a specific service for a specified amount of time. These grants are competitive and follow a specific cycle. An agency makes a funding program based on their mission, Administration, and/or congressional initiatives. Then the grant making agency announces the funding opportunity and invites groups to apply. After the application is closed all applicants are reviewed by the agency and award recipients are chosen. States compete for project grant funding by going through the application process and those that best meet the application criteria are selected. An example of project grant funding is the grants given by the Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services which operates the Wildlife Services Program. Applicants who meet the goal and the criteria might receive this funding for programs that help ‚ÄúReduce damage caused by mammals and birds and those mammal and bird species that are reservoirs for zoonotic diseases, (except for urban rodent control through control and research activities).\\" as the grants objectives specify. = Formula grant funding = Formula grant funding is for services that help a particular group of people, such as low income students or children with disabilities. Unlike project grants, these do not involve a competitive process. All applicants who apply and meet the criteria receive funding based on a formula created by the federal government. Congress decides how much money to spend in an area and then they divvy it up to applicants (usually states) by their formula. This formula can be based on population or project goals. For example, the United States Department of Health and Human Services operates the Nutrition Services Incentive Program. This program offers grant funding for states to give nutritious meals to the elderly in a geographic location. The formula used to determine how much grant money to give a state is based on how many meals were given out the year before within that state. Categorical grants  Head Start was created in 1965 as a summer school program to help low income students catch up before the start of their first year in school. Now they serve more than 1 million low income families per year in education health and encouraging parental involvement. Head Start programs are partially funded by categorical grants and in 2014 Congress gave over 500 million towards the program. Head Start categorical grant participants have to follow conditions of the grant meaning they have to make reports to the US Department of Health and Human Services periodically as well as submit to an annual audit. Medicaid is also partially funded by categorical grants. Funds are given in the form of a formula grant to each state. Medicaid like Head Start is group specific in that it is meant to help low income persons and families. Other categorical grant funded programs include Food Stamps program, Magnet School programs.  Cooperative federalism  Categorical grants increase the ability of the federal government to influence policy at the state and local levels. The founding fathers, particularly the antifederalists, were skeptical of the power of the national government, and so the Constitution does not afford the federal government many tools to steer policy at the state and local levels. This means that when Congress has ideas about things they would like to implement on a national level, they have to have a way to get states to comply or agree. Categorical grants and other grants provide a way for the federal government to work cooperatively with the states and still get a broader national outcome. This outlines the basic idea of cooperative federalism where the states and the federal government work cooperatively and equally to achieve something bigger than either can do alone. Grants become incentives in this way for states to help implement federal government national plans. An example would be the federal government offering grant money to fix highways on the condition that states enforce the drinking age.  Economic theory  Possible Crowd Out of Categorical Grant Economists have studied the idea of categorical grants through the systems they support, such as Medicaid, food stamps, and education programs. Specifically, they have looked at how these grants might cause the income and crowding out effects. The crowding out effect is when the government's giving essentially lowers the amount of money the private sector would be able to provide themselves. This is always a concern with government grants. For example, if the government provides a categorical grant for education then some states might end up spending less on education than they would have without it because they are able to move to a better level of education without spending as much. This problem occurs when the amount of the grant is less than the state would have been willing to spend originally. They then use the grant to replace what they would have spent and therefore have more money to spend on other goods. Some economists believe in the Flypaper effect instead meaning that when more money is given to an area it tends to stick there like flypaper. This means that the state would essentially raise the budget for a good or service if they continued to get more money for it.

In its role as a membership organisation it connects businesses around its mission of improving the practice of management in Ireland. An alliance between University College Cork and the Irish Management Institute was announced in June 2011 by Taoiseach Enda Kenny. The IMI and UCC have been collaborating since 2009. As of 2014, the majority of the degrees offered by the IMI are accredited by UCC.  History  The idea for the institute originated from a committee set up by Michael Dargan, T.P. Hogan and other businessmen. The motivation was to establish an organisation that would further the science and practice of business management in Ireland. Those involved were inspired primarily by the American Management Association and The Conference Board. At the same time the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Se√°n Lemass had prompted a separate group of leading semi-state and private bosses into investigating a similar idea. Both groups merged and the inaugural meeting of the Irish Management Institute was held on 9 December 1952 in the Gresham Hotel. The founding chairman was Sir Charles Harvey. The objective of the institute was to raise the standard of management in Ireland. Originally it did this through corporate and personal memberships, regular lectures and conferences, a journal called Irish Management, research and the establishment of a members library. After its first decade the institute became involved in management training courses. Part of IMI's original brief had been to encourage the universities to develop management education. In the early 1960s both UCD and Trinity College introduced master's degrees in management. This was an indication of management's growing stature as an academic discipline. In turn IMI created the Sir Charles Harvey Award for exceptional graduates of these courses. The first recipient was Patrick J. Murphy. IMI later went on to become a provider of education. Its popular Certificate in Supervisory Management (CISM) was the first academic course run by IMI and was the institute's first progression into all-island distance learning.Cox, p. 97 In 1973 IMI partnered with Trinity for the MSc (Management). The MSc epitomised IMI's teaching philosophy and is notable for being the first management degree in the world to be based on action learning.Cox, p. 149 Related courses followed over the next three decades. Other affiliations with Irish universities have included a Masters in information technology development with NUI Galway and a research alliance with the University of Limerick.Cox, p. 151 In 2003 IMI launched their support and delivery of the Flexible Executive Henley MBA programme. In 2011 the institute began an alliance with UCC. UCC now accredits IMI's diploma and degree courses. UCC controversially bought the IMI and the IMI was merged into UCC.UCC bought private college without liability for pensions by Niall Murray, Educational Correspondent, Irish Examiner, May 10, 2017.  Board and Council  IMI is owned by its members. Its council acts an advisory body for IMI management and is elected from a group of senior executives from member organisations. Council members serve as ambassadors for IMI within Irish industry and are the electoral college for IMI's board of directors. The board is responsible for IMI's strategy and planning. The CEO (formerly the director general) is in charge of managing the institute.  Campus  The institute was originally headquartered upstairs in 81 Grafton Street. As its activities increased it required greater space prompting further moves to 79 Merrion Square in 1954, 12 Leeson Park in 1956, Errigal on the Orwell Road in Rathgar in 1963 and, finally, the purpose-built, 13-acre (53,000 m2) National Management Centre in Sandyford, which opened on 25 September 1974.Cox, pp. 43‚Äì211 Around the time of sale the secluded site was considered a prospective location by Soviet Russia for its embassy in Ireland.Cox, p. 200 The architect Arthur Gibney was awarded with the RIAI Gold Medal 1974-1976 for the building, which took design inspiration from the system of step terraces used in the Oakland museum of California. The site was developed to incorporate existing natural features, its distinctive trees and small hills, as well as Clonard, a mid-nineteenth century house. A sculpture by Michael Warren called Dolmen was erected in 2000. A residential block and conference centre were later added, for which Arthur Gibney & Partners won the RIAI Best Commercial Building Award in 2005.

It is a Java application, so it can run in Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It also has a version that can run as an Eclipse plugin.  Release cycle  Oxygen XML has three types of releases, not counting betas or development versions. Major releases, such as 17 as of the end of 2015, occur on average once per year. Minor releases, 17.1 as of the end of 2015, are made at least once every few months after a major release, occasionally twice a year. Incremental build releases are provided on an as needed basis, usually in response to either bugs or security issues. Build numbering is based upon the date and time (to the hour) of the build. As of the end of 2015 the current full version and build number is \\"oXygen XML Editor 17.1, build 2015121117\\" with a full release history available online., Build History of Editor, Developer, and Author Releases (20/12/2015).  XML editing features  Oxygen XML offers a number of features for editing XML documents. Documents can be checked for proper XML form. They can also be validated against a schema. For validation purposes, the documents can be validated against DTD, W3C XML Schema, RELAX NG, Schematron, NRL and NVDL schemas. The editor can also validate the XML as it is entered. For additional schema types, a validation scenario can be generated, which allows oXygen to call out to arbitrary programs to perform validation. Also, the program has support for XML catalogs. An XML catalog is an XML file of a specific format that maps a schema definition string to an actual file name on the disk or web. Using catalogs allows the user to specify a web address for a schema, but allows oXygen to find a file form of the address if the catalog specifies one. Oxygen XML comes with schemas and DTDs for popular or major XML and XSL formats including DocBook (versions 4.0 and 5.0), TEI format, XSLT (versions 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0), DITA, XHTML and HTML 5. Extending to new XML dialects or specialisations is achieved by adding the relevant framework or implementation to the software or loading the document type or schema, thus enabling an adaptable environment which is itself configured entirely by XML, which draws parallels with Emacs and its ability to edit itself while implementing the Lisp dialect it runs in. The program is aware of XInclude, and all validation and transformation services can follow the XInclude statements to their included files. Oxygen XML offers three views designed for editing XML documents. These views are text, grid, and author. = Text view = The text view is the default view for editing an XML document. As the name suggests, this view shows the XML text as text. For documents that are associated with an XML schema, Oxygen XML offers tag completion. Oxygen XML can use a number of XML schema languages, including DTD, W3C XML Schema, RELAX NG (both compact and full). Both W3C XML Schema and RELAX NG schemas can include embedded Schematron rules. It also can use the NRL and NVDL routing languages, which allow multiple schemas of different types to be applied to different files. In addition to tag completion, annotations in the schema will be displayed as tooltips for the elements that those annotations apply to. For schema formats that do not have a standard mechanism to bind the schema to the XML file, Oxygen XML provides a processing instruction that instructs the program as to which schemas to use. For documents that do not have a schema, Oxygen can analyze the structure of the document and generate a schema. = Grid view = The grid view shows the XML document in a spreadsheet-like fashion. The left-most column shows the elements, including comments and processing instructions, at the root level. The next column shows attributes of root elements, and every unique first child of the root XML element. If the root element has six children all named \\"section\\", then the grid view will show only one section element and a notation that there are six of them. This iteration continues for the next column. This view is not often useful for HTML or other document-like formats, but it can be useful for certain XML formats that resemble spreadsheets. With the exception of spaces, this view shows the entire structure of the XML file. All of the textual information in the file will be presented in this view. = Author view = New to Oxygen XML v9.x was an author view providing a WYSIWYM view of the XML document. This smaller version of the Editor, called oXygenXML Author, is provided as a cheaper option in the commercial options where the full feature set may not be required. Author is centered on general XML document editing., Feature Matrix: Editor vs. Author (retrieved 20/12/2015). This view is based on providing a CSS file for the document that specifies the data type for each element in the document's schema. Oxygen XML comes with document CSS files for formats like DITA, DocBook, and TEI. XML tags and attributes in this view can be completely disabled or can be shown in various combinations. Editing in this view is an intermediate step between true WYSIWYG and editing in the regular text view in terms of complexity for the author. The XML elements are made more human-readable and intuitive, but the nesting and semantics of the XML document are still clear. The cursor can be placed between any elements, and when the cursor's position is ambiguous, a tool-tip window will appear showing a local view of the XML tree and the cursor's position in it. A bar along the top of the view shows the list of elements from the document root to the element under the cursor. XML elements are never implicitly inserted into the document. However, a common action in editing document-like XML files is to create a new element of the same name following the current one. The author view will perform this operation if the user presses the enter key twice (pressing it once brings up a dialog of possible elements to add, if tag competition is available). Inserting elements can be done through oXygen's XML refactoring commands to insert an element at the current cursor location. Even if XML tags are set to be non-visible, an indication for an empty element is always displayed using that element's name. Attributes on XML elements cannot directly be edited. However, Oxygen XML does have an attribute panel that, when content completion information is available, can be used to both see and set the value of attributes on the current element.  Editing of specialized XML formats  Though Oxygen XML can edit any XML document, providing content completion for documents with a schema binding, it is able to recognize certain XML documents innately. Oxygen XML provides schema editing features for both W3C XML Schema and RELAX NG's XML form. It offers visual editing support for both, as well as schema-less syntax highlighting and content completion. Oxygen XML offers support for XSLT documents, both version 1.0 (with EXSLT extensions) and 2.0. XSLT elements are recognized and drawn in a different color from non-XSLT XML elements. It also provides special validation services for XSLT documents. For example, it can validate that an attribute containing an XPath string is a valid XPath. oXygen XML automatically assumes that documents with the .xsl and .xslt extensions are XSLT files, and it treats them accordingly. It also offers support for editing XSL-FO documents, though it does not provide visual editing features for it.  Editing of non-XML files  Though Oxygen XML is primarily an XML editor, it does come with the ability to edit a number of non-XML textual formats. It has syntax completion for DTD, RELAX NG's compact format, XQuery, CSS and regular HTML. It also provides basic syntax highlighting support for a number of common web scripting languages to a degree, such as Python, Perl, and JavaScript, among others.  Document transformation  XSLT-based document transformation is a common operation on XML files, and Oxygen XML provides support for these operations. It allows the user to define a transformation scenario that specifies the application of a particular XSLT file to the current XML document. Each transformation scenario is aware of all of the parameters of its designated XSLT file and provides for editing them graphically. Additionally, the results of the transformation scenario can be piped through an XSL-FO processor, whether that be the built-in FOP processor or an external one. The final output filename, path and extension can be specified for a transform scenario, as can command-line parameters. Transform scenarios can be local to a particular Oxygen XML-project workspace or global to all projects. Oxygen XML comes with a number of standard global-transform scenarios for common tasks, e.g., from DocBook documents into PDF through XSL- FO and FOP, or into HTML. It also comes with a recent version of the DocBook XSL XSLT transformation suite. Oxygen XML comes with DITA Open Toolkit, which allows publishing (exporting) entire DITA-document structures to different output formats, including PDF, WebHelp, and EPUB.  XSLT debugger  Oxygen XML provides comprehensive debugging facilities for XSLTs. It offers features comparable to source-code debuggers like gdb, including breakpoints, the ability to look at the current context and \\"memory\\", and single-stepping through the XSLT. It can debug both XSLT version 1.0 and 2.0.  Licensing  A choice of either \\"Named User\\" or server based floating licensing. The former favours small businesses or individual developers, who may install it anywhere as long as it is just the specific named user utilising it. The latter favours larger teams that can benefit by sharing licenses across a global network spanning multiple time zones. An additional group license is available for the academic version only., Licensing FAQ section (retrieved 20/12/2015). Academic licenses are available to academic staff, students and educational institutions, but the license limits use of the software to academic or research purposes only and cannot be used for commercial purposes., Academic license (retrieved 20/12/2015). Commercial licenses are available in a Professional stream and an Enterprise stream for both the Author only edition and the full Editor edition., Professional and Enterprise licenses (retrieved 20/12/2015). Either user or floating licenses are available for each stream with value gaining for the latter with a larger number of users. Chief differences between the Enterprise edition and the Professional edition is the high-end databases directly supported. Though the Professional edition still provides direct support for Berkeley DB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, JDBC connections and generating an XML schema from a relational database structure., Academic/Enterprise vs. Professional/Personal features (retrieved 20/12/2015). Additionally there is a Personal edition for independent developers or free lancers paying for it themselves rather than by their employer. The Personal edition is identical to the Professional edition with regards to features, the only differences are the much lower price, though higher than a single academic license, as well as providing the full Editor edition rather than just the Author component., Personal license (retrieved 20/12/2015). An optional support and maintenance subscription is available which includes full upgrades, including for major releases during the maintenance period. With 17 major releases across 13 years of operation the annual maintenance offers (averaging around 20% of the full license cost) is cost effective. The term of the maintenance can be extended effectively indefinitely by renewing prior to the expiration date., support and maintenance FAQ section (retrieved 20/12/2015).

Vanity Fair (1868‚Äì1914), British The second Vanity Fair is a British weekly magazine published from 1868 to 1914. Subtitled \\"A Weekly Show of Political, Social and Literary Wares\\", it was founded by Thomas Gibson Bowles, who aimed to expose the contemporary vanities of Victorian society. The first issue appeared in London on November 7, 1868. It offered its readership articles on fashion, current events, the theatre, books, social events and the latest scandals, together with serial fiction, word games and other trivia. Bowles wrote much of the magazine himself under various pseudonyms such as \\"Jehu Junior\\", but contributors included Lewis Carroll, Willie Wilde, P. G. Wodehouse, Jessie Pope and Bertram Fletcher Robinson (editor: June 1904 ‚Äì October 1906). A full-page, color lithograph of a contemporary celebrity or dignitary appeared in most issues, and it is for these caricatures that Vanity Fair is best known today. Subjects included artists, athletes, royalty, statesmen, scientists, authors, actors, soldiers, religious personalities, business people and scholars. More than two thousand of these images appeared, and they are considered the chief cultural legacy of the magazine, forming a pictorial record of the period. The final issue of the British Vanity Fair appeared on February 5, 1914.

By this time, he was already known as a left-leaning intellectual. In 1910 he launched L‚ÄôEffort libre, a \\"review of revolutionary civilization\\". He joined the French Army in World War One and was injured three times on the battlefields of the Marne and in Verdun. After the war, he felt remorse for having joined the army. He also suffered from neurosis caused by the horrors of war and by the premature death of his youngest daughter, Solange. It was during this time that Bloch traveled to Africa on the advice of a friend. His logbook made during this maritime voyage was published in newspapers and magazines of the period and was later serialized into a three volume book set. In 1937, he was responsible for organising Naissance d'une cit√©, a \\"popular spectacle\\" performed on 19 October as part of the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne.

Yodo had a clipper bow and two smokestacks, whereas Mogami had a straight raked bow with three smokestacks.Conway, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1905‚Äì1922, page 236 Background Designed and built domestically in Japan, the lightly armed and lightly armored Yodo-class vessels were intended for scouting, high speed reconnaissance, and to serve as dispatch vessels. However, they were already obsolete when designed, with the development of wireless communication used during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. Yodo was the first warship to be built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries at its Kawasaki Shipyard in Kobe. Service life Sketch of Yodo in 1909 by Oscar Parkes Completed after the end of the Russo-Japanese War, Yodo was used initially for training and coastal patrol duties. In November 1911, Yodo was dispatched to Bangkok, Siam as part of the Japanese naval delegation attending the coronation ceremonies for King Rama VI of Thailand. Yodo was re-classified as a 1st class gunboat on 12 October 1912. In World War I, she was assigned to the Japanese 2nd fleet, and although present at the Battle of Tsingtao, did not see any combat. She was subsequently assigned to patrols of former German Micronesia, which has been occupied by Japan during the early stages of the war. After World War I, Yodo was used as a surveying ship and made various survey trips along the China coast, along with being assigned various miscellaneous auxiliary duties, from its home port at Kure Naval District. With the growing conflict in China following in 1931 Manchurian Incident, Yodo was assigned primarily to patrols of the north China coastline in the 1930s, with her patrol area extending to the central China coastline after the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Yodo was demilitarized on 1 April 1940 and renamed Hulk #13. It remained moored to a pier at Iwakuni throughout World War II, and was towed to Hikari, where she was broken up for scrap in 1945.

It is the biggest satellite town of Taiping. During the Malayan Emergency between 1948 and 1960, Kamunting was the site of a major British/Commonwealth military base, there being a large garrison for the 28th Commonwealth Independent Infantry Brigade and also one of the three British Military Hospitals (BMHs) in Malaya. Between Taiping and Kamunting is one of the main Military Cemeteries in Malaya. Over the many years of the conflict against the Communist terrorists, thousands of British, Australian, New Zealand, Fijian and Gurkha troops lived - and died - in and around Kamunting and Taiping. Kamunting houses the main bus station (Kamunting Raya) for Taiping town. Soon the Taiping train station will relocate there too. It has a weekly night market every Saturday night near the bus station that sells all sorts of local fresh produce and food stuffs. There are also fruit sellers along the road leading to the Kamunting bus stops which sell seasonal fruits like durian and mangosteens. It also connects Taiping to the North‚ÄìSouth Expressway via the northern exit. Major tourist spot is Bukit Jana, which has a waterfall and streams off the range of Bukit Larut. The Bukit Jana Golf & Country Club is also situated nearby. Plans for Taiping sports centre, which includes a 15000-seater stadium, indoor venues and extreme sports site, are still under consideration.  History  Long Jaafar bin Abdul Latif (Datuk Paduka Setia) is synonymous with the early history of the town of Taiping and Kamunting. In his youth, Long Jaafar had to go to Bukit Gantang which was under control in-law, Alang Alaiddin (Datuk Panglima Bukit Gantang). In that time, this area is still wilderness. One day, Long Jaafar was bathing in a river . He found a sand which is black and contains bijih timah. So, he was interested in commercializing tin mining until large. The place who first found bijih timah is named Kelian Pauh (now the vicinity of Taiping Prison) . Kelian mean mine or mines, while Pauh is a tiny mango fruit. Kelian Pauh is the old name for the town of Taiping. In 1840, Long Jaafar has brought in three people of Chinese miners to start mining work in Kelian Pauh (Taiping). In addition, the Malay population in the area was also mine but only in the summer and during the rainy season, they carry out work on the smelting of bijih timah. With Chinese aid, bijih timah production increased. According to records, in 1844, the tin from this area have been exported to Penang. In 1848, Long Jaafar has brought in 20 people of Penang Chinese workers to work and open mines in the area. One day, his pet elephant used to transport bijih timah have missed and fled into the woods. During the three days, elephant which is named Larut went missing because wallowing in a swamp, in the jungle not far from the residence of Long Jaafar. After Larut (the elephant) recaptured, it was found that elephant legs and body are filled with black sludge that containing sand of bijih timah. Finally, Long Jaafar has found another new place rich in bijih timah. That place was named Kelian Bahru which means new mine. Kelian Bahru is the old name for the Kamunting. While there are areas in Kelian Pauh and Kelian Bahru and surrounding areas named Larut, taken from the name of the elephant who discovers the tin mine. Kelian Bahru (Kamunting) opened after bijih timah found in this area. Groups that occupy this area is Hakka tribe who called Fui Chew. There is also a group known as Hakka Chinese Macao stay here. While in Kelian Pauh (Taiping), mines operated by Chinese Hakka, Chen Sang. At this time most of the Malays occupy Bukit Gantang and Trong. In the 1850s, the number of Chinese miners here amounted to 5,000 and increased to 35,000‚Äì40,000 people by the 1870s. Early 1860s, the number of Chinese residents in Kelian Pauh is of 4,000 people. There are about 100 pieces of row houses, between 70‚Äì80 houses belonging to Chen Sang and seven houses belong Fui Chew. 3000 inhabitants were miners and farmers. 20 mines in Kelian Pauh owned by Chen Yao and the other three are owned by the Hakka Fui Chew. Chinese residents in Kelian Bahru amounting to approximately 2,200 people. They occupy between 40 and 50 row houses shared. 2,000 inhabitants were miners and the remainder were vegetable farmers. 16 mines in Kelian Bahru dominated by Hakka Fui Chew and three mines belonging to the Hakka Chen Sang.  History  Kampung Baru Kamunting was founded over 80 years ago. According to Mr. Tan, the village headman, it is the smallest new village among all the new villages in Malaysia. During the last 10 to 15 years, the government has given subsidies for local infrastructure. The houses in Kampung Baru Kamunting are mostly made of wood and scattered around the village randomly. The common modes of transport are motorcycles and cars. The nearest town is Taiping which is 5 km away from the village. The local authority is Majlis Perbandaran Taiping. Today the population of the village is about 3,000. Many youth from Kampung Baru Kamunting have left for better job opportunities elsewhere.

Despite the school's recent construction, its population is growing at a rate faster than the supportable growth rate. For the 2010 and 2011 school year the boundary for the school changed, thus dropping the student population by 300 students to a more manageable population of 1700 students. Unique mathematics program Fletcher's Meadow Secondary School has a very unique approach to teaching mathematics. The focus at Fletcher's Math is away from rote memorization and directly onto abstract thinking and knowledge. They administer this through \\"thinking assessments\\" in which a student is given an open ended problem with certain constrains and the student is to come up with a general solution, that the user reading can input any values that follow their format and their answer will be correct. It makes the student write down which restrictions are allowed for the question, why they chose particular variables and formulas and makes the student explain why their solution is correct and well explained. Examples of level 4+ work could include having multiple solutions, having a generalization formula that works for the general case P(n). These usually follow the format goal, plan, execution (base case is shown here), and then reflection. These thinking assessments allow one to think openly about a problem and write a general solution that can give the reader reading it, an infinite array of solutions for the problem, and really shows the student has thought out of the box, and connected the ideas and meaning behind the mathematics taught to them to the work they are doing. In addition to this, Fletcher's has started to beta test grade-less tests, rather than students focusing on grades, they focus on the concepts they do not learn, the teachers assess the students through (usually weekly) assessments that test on concepts, which gives the student, the ability to go back and learn concepts, rather than chase marks. This approach with thinking assessments and focusing on concept and not grades has allowed Fletcher's graduates to go onto university level mathematics and be prepared for abstract concepts, without computation and sole theory. An example of a Calculus and Vectors exam level thinking question is the following: Describe the procedure for a general formula of a cubic function f(x) in the form f(x) = ax3 \\\\+ bx2 \\\\+ cx + d, where f(x) goes through the origin, f(1) must be an integer, there is an inflection point at x = 3 and there is a local extrema at x = -2. DECA Team Fletcher's Meadow Secondary School participates in the annual DECA competition, and has become renowned for their transition from an underdog team to a known competitor. Fletcher's also has one of the DECA biggest chapters in all of Ontario. Fletcher's DECA completely revitalized their program with the executives from 2017 & 2018 (lead by Amrita Bhachu and Fayk Chaudhry) choosing to run the club on the philosophy that no individual should be denied entry, but given equal opportunity to learn and experience DECA. This along with unique teaching methods in the past year and has since sent many individuals from their chapter to DECA Provincials and also sending some to represent Ontario at DECA's International Career Development Conference in 2017, 2018. In the year 2018, Fletcher's won over 14 medallions DECA Provincials. In the years 2017 and 2018, Fletcher's has sent students such as Balpreet Cheema, Karanveer Cheema, Muhammad Fayk Chaudhry, Charmi Sanghvi, and Manpreet Sandhu to participate in ICDC, either in competitive events or in the leader academies. The school also used to host an intra- school competition known as DECA Apprentice. In it, small teams compete in a variety of different challenges that emulate those of the business world, such as pitching an idea, budgeting, teamwork and collaboration. The competition is a blend of the DECA case competition and NBC's reality show The Apprentice. Teams are given a time-frame in order to complete a task and are graded on the quality of their work. In the end, the team with the highest total score wins a prize, and there are two runners-up. Robotics team Fletcher's Meadow Secondary School participates in the annual FIRST Robotics & VEX Competitions. They started a team in 2011 and have been active since then. In 2012, the team participated in two competitions: GTR East at Oshawa and GTR West at Hershey Centre. In 2018, Fletcher's team of juniors was selected as VEX Robotics team captains at a regional tournament. Awards won by Team 3705: *2011 - GTR West Animation Award *2012 - Safety Animation Award (globally won by 3705) *2012 - GTR West - placed 11th in qualification rounds and had the second best record of 8-2-0 Apart from FIRST, students also participate in the Skills Canada Challenges: Robotics Team of 4: *2011 - Silver Medal at Peel Technological Skills Challenge *2012 - Gold Medal at Peel Technological Skills Challenge *2019 - Silver Medal at Peel Technological Skills Challenge Virtual Robotics Team of 2: *2011 - Gold Medal at Peel Technological Skills Challenge *2011 - Silver Medal at Ontario Skills Challenge *2012 - Silver Medal at Peel Technological Skills Challenge *2016 - Gold Medal at Peel Technological Skills Challenge Extracurricular activities The school offers sports including track and field, volleyball, baseball, soccer, football, badminton and tennis. These sport teams compete in many tournaments throughout Ontario. The Global Youth Issues Club is a very active club at Fletcher's and hosts events like a cake auction, vow of silence, and Halloween for Hunger during the school year. They are a Free the Children's club that promotes awareness about global issues/causes to youth. Each year the school hosts an intra-school competition known as the Science Olympics. In it large teams complete a variety of science related challenges that promote teamwork, collaboration, and critical thinking. Teams are composed of students in grades 9-12 and choose their own mascot, name and logo. In the end, the team with the fastest completion time wins. The competition is hosted by the school's science department. The school recently formed a jazz combo, consisting of eight senior members. As a Fletcher's first, both the Jazz Combo and the school's Concert Band, a large group of music students of all ages, competed in MusicFest 2016, a national music competition across Canada. The groups earned silver and bronze awards, respectively. Mainstage production Each year, Fletcher's showcases on a play, musical or variety show.

It is located on the northern edge of the city of Leicester. History It was built as a family home for Edmund and Ann Cradock in 1709 in the midst of of walled gardens in Belgrave, Leicester. Only two years after its completion, both Edmund and Ann died, and it was then owned by the Simons family for 45 years, the Vann family for 78 years, (during which time they also built the nearby Belgrave House'Parishes added since 1892: Belgrave', A History of the County of Leicester: volume 4: The City of Leicester (1958), pp. 420-428. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66590 Date accessed: 4 July 2014), the Ellis family for 76 years, and Thomas Morley for 13 years. In 1936, it was bought by Leicester City Council, at which point it became a museum. The council recently made the decision to use the house and gardens as a heritage site rather than a museum, and it is now only open at certain times during the summer months. It is also available for private functions, such as weddings and ghost watches. Construction Belgrave, with Hall and church in the distance Belgrave Hall was built as a substantial family home between 1709 and 1713 by Edmund Cradock, a Leicester hosiery merchant, on a site adjacent to Belgrave Church. At the time Belgrave was a small village three miles from Leicester, between the roads to Loughborough and Lincoln, and Belgrave Hall set a trend for wealthy businessmen to build themselves out-of-town houses in the area. The house, fronting onto Church Road, is a three-storey building in an unadorned classical style, from blue and red bricks, laid in Flemish bond, creating a chequered pattern. There are lead rainwater heads with the Cradock family crest, some of which have a 1709 date and others with 1713. This unusually long construction period, along with brickwork and ground-plan irregularities on the south side, may imply a re-design or halt to construction while building was underway. The road frontage has imposing wrought iron gates which incorporate an 'EC' monogramStatham, Erica, (2015) 'The Cradocks of Belgrave Hall, and an inheritance wrangle', Leicestershire Historian, No 51, p.25-28, LAHS leading to a recessed doorway, and a brick parapet which hides the three hipped gables of the roof, creating a very rectangular facade. The Cradocks Edmund Cradock (cousin of Edmund Cradock of Knighton and nephew of Henry Hastings of Belgrave Old Hallsee link to Belgrave Hall Information Sheet , Story of Leicester, Leicester City Council, 2012, p.4) and his wife Anne are presumed to have moved into what was then known as 'The Mansion House' by 1713. However Edmund died while visiting Bath on 21 April 1715, two years after the house was completed. Under the terms of the will, his married daughter Jane was to receive ¬£1,000, with the residue split equally between the two younger children, who, like their parents, were named Anne and Edmund. Their mother received nothing from the will, and it is unknown how long she survived her husband. In order to begin distributing the assets of the estate the executors agreed the sale of The Mansion House in February 1716 for ¬£1,350 to John Simons who bought a further 16 acres of land nearby the following year. There may have been a delay in the payment for these as an interest payment also became due. However, the beneficiaries were clearly disappointed with both the slowness and the amount realised by the estate. They had anticipated a total of some ¬£5,000 including property and effects, but by the time debts and costs had been paid, there was not much left beyond the ¬£1,000 left to Jane. In 1718-19 the actions of the executors were challenged by the younger daughter Anne and her new husband, James Holwell, who filed a petition to the Court of Chancery. The outcome of the case is not clear, but The Mansion House remained firmly in the possession of John and Helen Simons. The Simons family John Simons had previously inherited the land opposite the hall, which at that time was orchards and paddocks running down to the River Soar. John and Helen had two sons, and when, in 1750, John died, he had land and property elsewhere to leave to his elder son, Revd Nicholas Simons. The younger son, Nicholas, inherited the now extensive Belgrave Hall estate. However, within 7 years Nicholas had mortgaged the property, and in 1757 he moved to Gumley, and let out Belgrave Hall to an old family friend, Sarah Boothby. In 1766 Sarah died, and, unable to make their mortgage repayments, Nicholas and his wife Elizabeth appeared in court. The result was that the Hall and lands were put up for sale, and bought by William Southwell, a linen draper from Nottingham, who along with his brother- in-law, William Vann, based their framework knitting business at the Hall, utilising the substantial outhouses for warehousing and office space. The Vann Family: Hall and House In 1767 William Southwell died, leaving Belgrave Hall to two of the Vann sons, William and Richard, who with their younger brother James, lived in the Hall, and were partners in the Belgrave-based hosiery business. William, who in 1785 went on to become High Sheriff of Leicestershire, built himself a new house in 1776, named Belgrave House, on the other side of the road from the hall. It was built in a 'sleek, classical style', and is also a grade II* listed building. The gardens on that side of Church Road were divided between the two properties Richard and James continued in the Hall, and when Richard died unmarried in 1796, The Hall and his half of the estate passed to James, who had the previous year married Hannah Clayton, daughter of the local vicar, when he was aged 49 and she 38. In 1803, James, like his brother William, served a year as High Sheriff of Leicestershire. None of the brothers had any children. So when James died in 1812, his will left the Hall and estate to his wife for her lifetime, and then to his cousin, Ann Hunt. Hannah survived for another 32 years and died in 1844, by which time Ann Hunt had married into the Marston family of Enderby, and had already died. The Belgrave Estate, which had by then become heavily mortgaged, was sold by Ann's heirs in 1845 to a railway entrepreneur called John Ellis.

Acquired from redundant material from the nationalised railway, 1952 John Ellis took possession of Belgrave Hall in 1847, when he was 58, with a wife and seven daughters. By the time he moved from Beaumont Leys to the Hall, he was one of Leicester's most prominent figures. In 1828 he had met George Stephenson, who having completed the Stockton and Darlington Railway was working on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Ellis was a key figure in getting the Stephensons to take on the building of a line from Leicester to the Swannington coalfields, which was completed in 1833.Clinker, C.R.

He was a Quaker and reformer, and in 1836 Ellis had become a Town Councillor. In 1840 he had attended the World's Anti-Slavery Convention.Ellis of Leicester: A Quaker Family's Vocation By 1845 as a director of the Midland Railway, he had overseen the merger with the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway. Having moved to his elegant 140-year-old house, he continued both his railway and public life roles. In 1849 he became chairman of the Midland Railway, and represented Leicester in Parliament between 1848 and 1852. John Ellis died in 1862, and his wife and five of his daughters stayed on at Belgrave Hall. The 'Belgrave sisters' played a leading role in various Leicester institutions, and hosted literary and social events at the Hall. They supported the suffragette movement, and Charlotte Ellis was on the 'Leicester Board of Guardians' for nine years, administering the town's poor law relief from 1892, alongside two other pioneer women guardians, Fanny Fullagar and Mary Royce.Leicester Women in Politics, Leicestershire Record Office exhibition, 2013, panel 3.

Statues Four statues remain from an original collection of 16 that were bought by the Vanns some time before 1790. These appear to have been a diverse collection of mythological subjects bought in Italy by Colonel Hewitt of Stretton Hall, and bought from his estate by the Vanns. They were described by John Throsby in his 'Leicestershire Views' as being \\"Pomona; Diana; Flora; Ceres; Hercules; Venus; a Satyr; a Turk and his consort; two Emperors and a Pope\\". Hannah Vann's will, at her death in 1842, notes the statues as items she hoped could stay in the family. Twelve appear to have been taken to Enderby by her heirs, where they were locally known as the 'Twelve Apostles', but have since been dispersed and mostly not been traced. Of the four that remain, perhaps because they were larger and less easily moved, two are in the formal gardens, and may be Throsby's 'Ceres' and 'Hercules'. The other two stand inside what were once the gates to Belgrave House, now part of Belgrave Gardens, and are both statues of the Greek god Telamon, but may be what Throsby describes as the two Emperors. Paranormal In 1999, Belgrave Hall became famous across the world when two ghostly figures were recorded on security cameras outside the Hall.

He was Pr√©fet of the former D√©partment of the Seine, which included Paris, from 1833 to 1848. He established the groundwork for the fundamental transformation of Paris that Haussmann carried out under the Second Empire. Career His administration was marked by the implementation of the theories of the hygienists. One year before his nomination, an epidemic of cholera devastated Paris. Rambuteau thought that the narrow, tortuous streets and small disease-prone districts in the centre of Paris encouraged the development of the disease. He commenced the cutting of 13 metre-wide roads through Paris with the widening of the Rue Rambuteau in 1839, which was later named after him. This was the first time wide roads had been built in central Paris. Under his administration, the Arc de Triomphe in the Place de l'√âtoile was finished and the building of the great avenue of the Champs-√âlys√©es was commenced. The motto of Rambuteau was: \\"water, air, shade\\". He thus modernised the sewers of Paris and ordered the construction of many fountains. Some of his fountains in Paris parks still function. He developed gas lighting and the planting of trees along the avenues. At the beginning of his administration the city had 69 gas jets; at his departure it had 8,600 gas jets. He also commenced the construction of the famous pissoirs (public urinals) along the roads of Paris.

It is the main competitor to the Kurgan hypothesis, or steppe theory, the more favoured view academically. Description The Anatolian hypothesis suggests that the speakers of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) lived in Anatolia during the Neolithic era, and it associates the distribution of historical Indo-European languages with the expansion during the Neolithic revolution of the 7th and the 6th millennia BC. This hypothesis states that Indo-European languages began to spread peacefully, by demic diffusion, into Europe from Asia Minor from around 7000 BC with the Neolithic advance of farming (wave of advance). Accordingly, most inhabitants of Neolithic Europe would have spoken Indo-European languages, and later migrations would have replaced the Indo-European varieties with other Indo-European varieties.. The expansion of agriculture from the Middle East would have diffused three language families: Indo-European languages toward Europe, Dravidian languages toward Pakistan and India, and Afroasiatic languages toward the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa. Reacting to criticism, Renfrew revised his proposal to the effect of taking a pronounced Indo-Hittite position. Renfrew's revised views place only Pre-Proto-Indo-European in the 7th millennium BC in Anatolia, proposing as the homeland of Proto-Indo-European proper the Balkans around 5000 BC, which he explicitly identified as the \\"Old European culture\\", proposed by Marija Gimbutas. He thus still locates the original source of the Indo-European languages in Anatolia around 7000 BC. Reconstructions of a Bronze Age PIE society, based on vocabulary items like \\"wheel\\", do not necessarily hold for the Anatolian branch, which appears to have separated at an early stage, prior to the invention of wheeled vehicles.. Map showing the Neolithic expansion from the seventh to fifth millennium BC. According to Renfrew (2004), the spread of Indo-European proceeded in the following steps: *Around 6500 BC: Pre-Proto-Indo-European, in Anatolia, splits into Anatolian and Archaic Proto-Indo-European, the language of the Pre-Proto-Indo-European farmers who migrate to Europe in the initial farming dispersal. Archaic Proto- Indo-European languages occur in the Balkans (Starƒçevo‚ÄìK√∂r√∂s culture), in the Danube valley (Linear Pottery culture), and possibly in the Bug-Dniestr area (Eastern Linear pottery culture). *Around 5000 BC: Archaic Proto-Indo-European splits into Northwestern Indo-European (the ancestor of Italic, Celtic, and Germanic), in the Danube valley, Balkan Proto-Indo-European (corresponding to Gimbutas' Old European culture) and Early Steppe Proto-Indo-European (the ancestor of Tocharian). The main strength of the farming hypothesis lies in its linking of the spread of Indo-European languages with an archaeologically- known event, the spread of farming, which scholars often assume involved significant population shifts. Bayesian analysis Research published in 2003 of \\"87 languages with 2,449 lexical items\\" by Russell Gray and Quentin Atkinson found an age range for the \\"initial Indo-European divergence\\" of 7800 to 9800 years, which was found to be consistent with the Anatolian hypothesis.. Using stochastic models to evaluate the presence or absence of different words across Indo-European, concluded that the origin of Indo- European goes back about 8500 years, the first split being that of Hittite from the rest (Indo-Hittite hypothesis). In 2006, the authors of the paper responded to their critics.. In 2011, the authors and S. Greenhill found that two different datasets were also consistent with their theory.. An analysis by Ryder and Nicholls (2011) found support for the Anatolian hypothesis: Bouckaert et al. (2012), including Gray and Atkinson, conducted a computerized phylogeographic study, using methods drawn from the modeling of the spatial diffusion of infectious diseases; it also showed strong support for the Anatolian hypothesis. despite having undergone corrections and revisions. Colin Renfrew commented on this study, stating that \\"[f]inally we have a clear spatial picture.\\" Criticism =Bayesian analysis= Bayesian analysis has been criticized on account of its inferring the lifespan of a language from that of some of its words; the idiosyncratic outcome of, for example, the Albanian language raises doubts about the method and the data.. Linguist Andrew Garrett, commenting on Bouckaert et al. (2012), stated that \\"[t]here is bias in the underlying data that leads to an erroneous conclusion, and strong evidence that is ignored which still strongly supports the Kurgan hypothesis.\\" According to David Anthony, \\"this type of model doesn't match the complex linguistic and archaeological evidence,\\" stating that \\"[t]he study is an example of retrofitting evidence to a model, but the results of such a model are only as useful as the underlying data and assumptions.\\" Linguist Paul Heggarty from the Max Planck Institute wrote in 2014:. Chang et al. (2015) also conducted a lexicostatistical (and some glottochronological) study, producing results different from the results produced by Gray and Atkinson. This study instead supports the Kurgan hypothesis.. =Dating= Piggot (1983) states that PIE contains words for technologies that make their first appearance in the archaeological record in the Late Neolithic, in some cases bordering on the early Bronze Age, some belonging to the oldest layers of PIE. The lexicon includes words relating to agriculture (dated to 7500 BC), stockbreeding (6500 BC), metallurgy (5500 BC), the plow (4500 BC), gold (4500 BC), domesticated horses (4000‚Äì3500 BC) and wheeled vehicles (4000‚Äì3400 BC). Horse breeding is thought to have originated with the Sredny Stog culture, semi-nomadic pastoralists living in the forest steppe zone, now in Ukraine. Wheeled vehicles are thought to have originated with Funnelbeaker culture in what is now Poland, Belarus and parts of Ukraine.. According to Mallory and Adams (2006), linguistic analysis shows that the Proto-Indo-European lexicon seems to include words for a range of inventions and practices related to the Secondary Products Revolution, which postdates the early spread of farming. On lexico-cultural dating, Proto-Indo-European cannot be earlier than 4000 BC.. According to Anthony and Ringe (2015) the main objection to the Anatolian hypothesis is that it requires an unrealistically early date. Most estimates date Proto-Indo-European between 4500 and 2500 BC, with the most probable date around 3700 BC. It is unlikely that late PIE, even after the separation of the Anatolian branch, postdates 2500 BC, as Proto-Indo-Iranian is usually dated to just before 2000 BC. On the other hand, it is not very likely that early PIE predates 4500 BC, as the reconstructed vocabulary strongly suggests a culture of the terminal phase of the Neolithic bordering on the early Bronze Age.. =Linguistics= Many Indo-European languages have cognate words meaning axle: Latin axis, Lithuanian a≈°is, Russian os' , and Sanskrit √°k·π£a. (In some, a similar root is used for the word armpit: eaxl in Old English, axilla in Latin, and kaksa in Sanskrit.) All of them are linked to the PIE root ak's-. The reconstructed PIE root iÃØeu-g- gives rise to German joch, Hittite iukan, Latin iugum and Sanskrit yug√°(m), all meaning yoke. Words for wheel and cart/wagon/chariot take one of two common forms, thought to be linked with two PIE roots: the root k ∑el- \\"move around\\" is the basis of the unique derivative k ∑ek ∑lo- \\"wheel\\" which becomes hv√©l (wheel) in Old Icelandic, kolo (wheel, circle) in Old Church Slavonic, k√£kla- (neck) in Lithuanian, kyklo- (wheel, circle) in Greek, cakka-/cakra- (wheel) in Pali and Sanskrit, and kuk√§l (wagon, chariot) in Tocharian A. The root ret(h)- becomes rad (wheel) in Old High German, rota (wheel) in Latin, r√£tas (wheel) in Lithuanian, and ratha (wagon, chariot) in Sanskrit. =Farming= The idea that farming in Western Eurasia was spread from Anatolia in a single wave has been revised. Instead, it appears to have spread in several waves by several routes, primarily from the Levant.. The trail of plant domesticates indicates an initial foray from the Levant by sea.. The overland route via Anatolia seems to have been most significant in spreading farming to Southeastern Europe.. =Genetics= A genetic study from the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (2015) favors Gimbutas's Kurgan hypothesis over Renfrew's Anatolian hypothesis but \\"does not reveal the precise origin of PIE, nor does it clarify the impact Kurgan migrations had on different parts of Europe\\". Lazaridis et al. (2016) noted on the origins of Ancestral North Indians:. However, Lazaridis et al. previously admitted being unsure \\"if the steppe is the ultimate source\\" of the Indo- European languages and believing that more data is needed.

Ultrajectine thought holds to the words of Vincent of L√©rins's Commonitory: \\"We must hold fast to that faith which has been held everywhere, always, and by all the faithful.\\" Ultrajectine thought rejects papal infallibility and holds to the belief that only the Church in ecumenical council may speak infallibly.  Name  Utrecht was the fortified former Roman limes castellum of Traiectum, which was so named because of its possibility to cross the Rhine.  Origins  The Ultrajectines are descendants of Jansenists who fled discrimination and legal persecution imposed by papal bulls in France and the Southern Netherlands, for refuge in the comparatively tolerant Dutch Republic, which was dominated by Calvinists and therefore theologically more sympathetic towards Jansenism and its doctrine of salvation. The Dutch Republic became a refuge for Jansenists while it was a belligerent in the Eighty Years' War; the Dutch Republic did not countenance clergy, appointed by the Holy See, entering its territory. they quickly rose to prominence within the Catholic laity who required ordained ministers. They were perceived to be loyal civil subjects and were favored by Calvinists and the government. Thus, Jansenist theologians assumed dominant positions in clandestine churches structure in the Dutch Republic. However, as relations between the Dutch Republic and Roman Catholic sovereigns relaxed to a more or less cold war state, the Papacy attempted to restore direct rule of Roman Catholic churches in the Dutch Republic. However, by the early 18th century, the Papacy had ruled that Jansenists were considered to be heretics and demanded the removal of all such theologians in the local Roman Catholic churches in the Dutch Republic. Refusing to submit to the ordinary and immediate jurisdiction of the pope delegated through vicars apostolic, unwilling to lose control of church property, and tending to believe Jansenism, The Ultrajectine schism culminated as a schismatic church with apostolic succession, the Roman Catholic Church of the Old Episcopal Clergy (') (OBC), in 1723 which retained Roman Catholic liturgy, apostolic succession and belief Jesuit priests and missionaries were smuggled into the Dutch Republic to reconvert congregations which had followed the dissident Ultrajectine hierarchy. A vigorous campaign was launched to vindicate Papal authority and to exhort the Catholic laity to turn to Papal appointed ministers for church matters. Additionally, the Holy See negotiated with the new Dutch authorities to gain legitimate status for their appointments. Upon gaining this approval from Dutch authorities to appoint Papally accepted ministers, the Jesuit position soon overcame the Jansenists. By the 19th century, the majority of dissident Catholic laity returned to Papal authority; already in the 18th century the majority of laity had disassociated from the Ultrajectine OBC. Neercassel was succeeded as vicar apostolic by another pro- Jansenist archbishop, Petrus Codde. Codde was suspended from the office of vicar apostolic in 1702 and excommunicated from the Catholic Church for his obduracy in 1704. After Codde, another bishop who played an important part was Bishop Dominique Marie Varlet, who had been appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Babylon by the Pope, but who instead spent his time in the Dutch Republic succouring Jansenists and appealing to Rome to rescind disciplinary censures against him. When Gerard Potcamp was appointed vicar apostolic in 1704, Jansenists constituted themselves into a Cathedral Chapter in Utrecht and proceeded to elect ministers. Since the Archdiocese of Utrecht was suppressed during the Protestant Reformation, the popes viewed this act as ecclesiastically illegitimate and invalid, since the bishops-elect were selected without an apostolic mandate from the Holy See. Varlet consecrated four of these men, and the last of these, Petrus Johannes Meindaerts, after Varlet died, consecrated bishops for the sees of Haarlem and Deventer (which had been defunct since 1580 and would be re-activated by the Papacy only as late as 1853) in order to prevent the loss of the historic episcopate (apostolic succession) among the Dutch Jansenists. According to Jacques Forget, in Catholic Encyclopedia, Jansenism did not lead to schism in the Kingdom of France as in the Low Countries. In the Dutch Republic, which was mostly Protestant, Catholics, as in England during the same period, lived in a provisional missionary territory of the Catholic Church, the Vicariate Apostolic of Batavia and later Mission sui iuris of Batavia, headed by a vicar apostolic during and after the Protestant Reformation. These representatives of the pope were soon won over to the doctrines of Cornelius Jansen's Augustinus. Johannes van Neercassel, who governed the whole church in the Netherlands from 1663 to 1686, was publicly associated with Jansenists. While Neercassel was vicar apostolic, the Dutch Republic became the refuge of all whose obstinacy forced them to leave the Kingdom of France and the Southern Netherlands. The refugees included Antoine Arnauld, Louis-Paul Du Vaucel, Gabriel Gerberon, Pasquier Quesnel, Pierre Nicole, , as well as a number of priests, monks, and nuns who preferred exile to the acceptance of apostolic constitutions including ' promulgated by Pope Innocent X in 1653, ' promulgated by Pope Alexander VII in 1656, and ' promulgated by Alexander VII in 1665. Many belonged to the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri. Codde went further than his predecessor, Neercassel, and refused to sign the 1665 Formula of Submission for the Jansenists prescribed in '. Codde was summoned to Rome where he defended himself poorly and was first forbidden to exercise his functions and then deposed by a decree in 1704. Codde was replaced by , but his appointment and those that followed were rejected by a faction of the clergy whom the States General of the Dutch Republic supported. The conflict lasted a long time, during which episcopal functions were not fulfilled. In 1723, the Chapter of Utrecht, which was according to Forget, \\"a group of seven or eight priests who assumed this name and quality in order to put an end to a precarious and painful situation,\\" selected, on its own authority, as archbishop-elect, one of its members, , who then held the office of vicar- general. This election was not canonical, according to Forget, and was not approved by the pope. Steenhoven nevertheless was consecrated by Bishop Dominique Marie Varlet, who was at that time suspended, interdicted, and excommunicated. The schismatic Ultrajectine church was interdicted and excommunicated. Those who had elected Steenhoven transferred their support to Cornelius Johannes Barchman Wuytiers, who was then consecrated by Varlet. Varlet lived long enough to consecrate two of Barchman's successors, Theodorus van der Croon and Petrus Johannes Meindaerts. Meindaerts was the sole surviving bishop. The Diocese of Haarlem (1742) and Diocese of Deventer (1757) were created as suffragan dioceses. According to Forget, Rome always refused to ratify these irregular acts and invariably replied to the notification of each election with a declaration of nullification and a sentence of excommunication against those elected and their adherents. Thus, according to the Roman Catholic point of view, Codde's, Varlet's, Steenhoven's, and Meindaerts' actions finally consummated the Ultrajectine schism by not only illicitly ordaining bishops, but especially by usurping diocesan ordinary jurisdiction and thereby interfering into the sole domain of the Roman Pontiff. However, Jansenists averred by referring to alleged long ecclesiastical precedence which (allegedly) allowed for ordination without Papal approval under particular circumstances. The Holy See convened the First Vatican Council in 1870, which codified and remodeled ecclesiastical procedures in favor of the Roman Curia. With this council and reestablishment of the episcopal hierarchy in the Netherlands, Popes proclaimed Jansenists as schismatics and once again excommunicated them and their adherents.  Secondary founders  After the Vatican Council of 1869‚Äì70 which formally defined Papal Infallibility, certain European Catholics, under the inspiration of the Bavarian priest J. D√∂llinger, seceded from the Roman Catholic Church and eventually styled themselves the Old Catholics; this schismatic group eventually federated with the Ultrajectines Church of Utrecht, the Old Catholic Church of Holland, and were provided their bishops by them. Thus the secondary founders of the schism of the German Old Catholics were D√∂llinger (partially), Franz Heinrich Reusch, Joseph Langen, Joseph Hubert Reinkens, Hertzog and others, mainly dissident Catholic theologians who accepted consecration from the bishops of Utrecht to form \\"Old Catholic Churches\\" in various European countries.  Tertiary founders  Arnold Harris Mathew, who had moved between various Christian denominations after having been suspended as a Roman Catholic priest, was instigated by the Modernist Fr. George Tyrrell to become an Old Catholic, and obtained consecration as head of the Old Catholic Church of England (Old Roman Catholic Church of Great Britain) by the Ultrajectines. Mathew went on to consecrate a wide range of men, some of whom emigrated to the United States where they founded a range of Old Catholic independent churches, varying between very conservative institutions to extremely liberal Gnostic churches. Some North American Old Catholics draw their lineage from Joseph Rene Vilatte, who was rejected as a candidate for consecration by the Union of Utrecht of the Old Catholic Churches (UU), but who was consecrated by Antonio Francisco Xavier Alvares, a Goan Catholic priest who apostatized to Jacobitism or Monophysitism as Mar Julius of the Jacobite Church of Ceylon, Goa and India. Although never a member of any denomination, Vilatte returned to North America after his consecration, reverted to Old Catholicism and went on to found several Old Catholic groups. Mathew and Vilatte are considered to be jointly the parents of the North American Old Catholic movement. although the ecumenical includes and maintains full intercommunion with the Anglican and the Philippine Independent churches. However, the Polish National Catholic Church (PNCC) in 2004 left the because of its acceptance of women's ordination. The Polish-Catholic Church of Republic of Poland, though not accepting women's ordination, remained in the .  Old Catholic claims vs. Roman Catholic claims  The Ultrajectines or Old Catholics claim that they are an autonomous or autocephalous branch of the Catholic (i.e., \\"Roman Catholic\\") Church; that they had never seceded or been expelled or properly excommunicated; that the Particular Church of Utrecht had been historically granted the privilege of electing its own bishop without Papal Mandate and that the consecration of the Jansenist Steenhoven and his consecration by Varlet and subsequently, that of Meindaerts, had been legal and not contrary to the Catholic Church's canon law and therefore did not constitute a schism, etc. The Ultrajectines claim that the Church of Jesus Christ, and thus the Catholic Church, is effectively larger than the Roman Catholic Church and includes all kinds of other ecclesial bodies. On the other hand, the Papacy claims that the schism of Utrecht is proven from the view of canon law. According to canon law, the Utrecht bishops were illicitly ordained and that they effectively usurped ordinary diocesan jurisdiction. Canon law asserts that only the Pope can perform ordinary diocesan jurisdiction. However, in reply, the Jansenists state this authority never applied them due to the nature of the original Papal Mandate and that the new powers of Papal supremacy were granted by a council which they were not allowed to attend. The Papacy recognizes the circumstances of the Jansenist claims. With Protestant Christianity winning over the populace religiously and politically the dominance in the (northern and central) Netherlands, the See of Utrecht had practically ceased to exist since 1580, and the Popes were forced to supply Catholics there through Vicars Apostolic (who however were Archbishop in partibus infidelium). Initially, as the Calvinist Protestant government was at war with the Papacy and Catholic Sovereigns, they could not permit the Vicars Apostolic to operate from territory they controlled. Thus, the Vicar Apostolics were based in French territory and in the territories of the German Catholic princes within the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. Later, as the diplomatic situation was relaxed to some extent, the Vicars Apostolic were permitted to reside within the Dutch Republic, and they took their seat at Utrecht. But Vicariates Apostolic are, by definition, not particular Sees but are under the personal and direct jurisdiction of the Pope, as opposed to Diocesan government; see Vicariate Apostolic. Both De Neercassel and Codde, his successor, were merely Vicars Apostolic of the Dutch Republics with their seats at Utrecht. That did not make them successors to the Bishops and the Archdiocesan See of Utrecht, which had lapsed into non-existence. However, the Jansenists do not specifically focus on the See as their center of gravity and point out that the Vicariate Apostolic could appoint other bishops. Thus, although the Papacy claims that as a Vicariate Apostolic, \\"Utrecht\\" as the seat of the Vicar, did not have the authority to constitute to itself, without specific authorization by the Pope, a \\"Cathedral Chapter\\", and such a unilaterally \\"re-constituted\\" \\"Cathedral Chapter\\" did not have the right to elect to itself a \\"bishop\\" as if it were heir to the rights of the defunct Cathedral Chapter of the defunct See of Utrecht, the Jansenists reply that the Papal arguments of usurpation is moot. Nonetheless, the succeeding bishops did assert new jurisdictions and authorities which did not have the authorization of the Pope. Thus, even if the \\"self-re-constituted\\" \\"See of Utrecht\\" is granted to be the heir to the former See of Utrecht, it never had authorization from the Pope, even as a privilege, and as heir to the former See, of erecting other suffragan \\"Sees\\", as the Ultrajectines have attempted or rather accomplished, by raising to themselves the Sees of Haarlem & Deventer. From the viewpoint of the Catholic Church's Canon Law, then, this action on the part of the Ultrajectines was and remains an act of usurpation and grave schism. Again, the creation of an \\"anti-Paparchy\\" branch in England under Mathew, and further branches in North America and elsewhere, with effectively setting up dioceses, were further acts of jurisdictional usurpation. Yet, in ending conclusion, the Jansenists' claim that having been abandoned by the Papacy, it was an act of ecclesiastical usurpation on the part of the Papacy for it to return and dislodge the Jansenists based on new authorities granted by the Papacy for itself without consultation from the Jansenists. Thus, they claim that the Papacy has created a fictitious legal dictate to claim that the Jansenists are without ecclesiastical legitimacy. Ultimately the argument between Jansenists and Papists was centered around conflicting interests. While the Papacy claims that nothing in the alleged \\"rights and privileges\\" of the See of Utrecht, to which Peter Codde, Cornelius van Steenhoven, Barchman Wuitiers, Croon and Meindaerts, etc. allege that they are the successors, justifies these acts of usurpation, the Jansenists claim that nothing they did was a usurpation until the Papacy effectively declared the Jansenists heretics.  Orthodoxy and Sensus Catholicus  The Roman Catholic Church maintains that the actions and teachings of the Ultrajectines are contrary to Catholic ecclesiology and the sensus Catholicus (sense of what is truly Catholic). This view follows from the Papacy's position that any movement which denies Papal supremacy is schismatic.

Yodo had a clipper bow and two smokestacks, whereas Mogami had a straight raked bow with three smokestacks.Conway, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1905‚Äì1922, page 236 Background Designed and built domestically in Japan, the lightly armed and lightly armored Yodo-class vessels were intended for scouting, high speed reconnaissance, and to serve as dispatch vessels. However, they were already obsolete when designed, with the development of wireless communication used during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. Mogami has the distinction of being the first turbine-powered vessel in the Imperial Japanese Navy. However, as the Japanese could not yet produce reduction gears, Mogami utilized an unwieldy system of three direct- drive marine turbine engines, two for cruising and one for high speed. She was also the first warship to be produced by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Nagasaki. Service life Completed after the end of the Russo-Japanese War, Mogami was used initially for training and coastal patrol duties. Mogami was re-classified as a 1st-class gunboat on 12 October 1912. Mogami was part of the Japanese fleet at the Battle of Tsingtao in World War I, and assisted in the sinking of the German torpedo boat S90, which had torpedoed and sank the cruiser earlier in the battle. The German ship ran out of fuel while trying to escape Tsingtao, and was intercepted by Mogami. From 1917-1921, Mogami was assigned to patrol duties in the Caroline Islands and Mariana Islands after Japan's capture of those island groups from Germany. From 1921-1928, Mogami was assigned to patrols off of the Siberian coast, and to fishery patrol duties, during the period of Japan‚Äôs Siberian Intervention against the Bolshevik Red Army during the Russian Civil War. Mogami was scrapped on 1 April 1928. Although Mogami was considered the more modern and advanced in design, with her higher speed and turbine engine, she was retired much earlier than her sister ship, , largely due to performance and maintenance issues with her engines. While being dismantled at Osaka, a spark from a welding torch ignited the remaining oil in Mogamis bunkers, causing an explosion and fire which destroyed the hulk of the vessel in two hours. The mainmast of Mogami was preserved at the Nakanoshima Park in downtown Osaka as a memorial until 9 February 2009 when it was removed to the Kure Maritime Museum.

Biography Scaasi was born Arnold Isaacs to a Jewish familyThe Tablet: \\"Remembering Arnold Scaasi, Jewish Designer to the Stars\\" By Rachel Shukert in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the son of a furrier. His decision to pursue a career in fashion was made at the age of fourteen during a trip to Australia to visit a stylish aunt. He returned to Montreal to study at the Cotnoir-Capponi School of Design and completed his education at the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture Parisienne in Paris. He apprenticed at the House of Paquin before moving to New York City to work with designer Charles James. In the early 1950s, Scaasi's designs began appearing in a variety of print ads, including one for General Motors photographed by Edgar de Evia. During the shoot he met Robert Denning, who suggested he reverse his last name to give himself an Italian flair. Under his new name he achieved the December 1955 cover of Vogue, which led to his starting a ready-to-wear line the following year. He won the prestigious Coty Fashion Critics Award in 1958. Bucking the trend for affordable fashions, Scaasi opened a couture salon catering to a clientele of socialites and celebrities in 1964. He was noted for his tailored suits and glamorous evening wear and cocktail dresses trimmed with feathers, fur, sequins, or fine embroidery. In 1968, he caught the eye of a worldwide audience when Barbra Streisand wore his sheer overblouse and pants ensemble to collect her Academy Award for Funny Girl. The media attention made him a household name overnight. He later designed Streisand's contemporary wear for the 1970 film On a Clear Day You Can See Forever and costumes for Shirley MacLaine and Susan Sarandon in Loving Couples (1980) and Sally Field in Kiss Me Goodbye (1982). Scaasi was presented with the Council of Fashion Designers of America Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996. Over the years, major retrospectives of his work have been presented at various venues, including Kent State University, Ohio State University, the Fashion Institute of Technology and the New-York Historical Society. The inaugural gown he designed for Barbara Bush is on display in the Smithsonian Institution. After being out of the limelight for several years, Scaasi appeared on Martha Stewart's syndicated daytime series in May 2007 to announce he was returning to the ready-to-wear market. Scaasi is the author of Scaasi: A Cut Above, published by Rizzoli in 1996, and Women I Have Dressed (and Undressed!), published by Scribner in 2004. He and his partner Parker Ladd were together for more than fifty years. Scaasi died of cardiac arrest at a New York city hospital on August 3, 2015 at the age of 85. Museum retrospectives In 2001, The Kent State University Museum mounted a major Arnold Scaasi retrospective curated by Anne Bissonnette to celebrate the museum's fifteenth anniversary. In 2009 the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston acquired more than 100 couture designs by Scaasi and his paper and video archives, including sketchbooks from his collections from 1958 to the early 1990s, and all of his press clippings. A major exhibition of some of those clothes was shown in 2010 at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in an exhibit called Scaasi: American Couturier, accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue. The MFA's Scaasi collection includes the famous sequined pants outfit which was worn by Barbra Streisand in 1969 when she won the Oscar for the movie Funny Girl, along with stage costumes worn in her early concerts, a fur ensemble worn on her famous trip to Canada in 1970, and costumes worn in On a Clear Day You Can See Forever. The collection also contains designs worn by Aretha Franklin, Mary Tyler Moore, Diahann Carroll, Arlene Francis, Joan Sutherland, Joan Rivers, [Bette Midler], Louise Nevelson and numerous other socialites from New York and Palm Beach. Other museums with holdings of Arnold Scaasi designs in their collection are the Historical Society of Palm Beach County in West Palm Beach, Florida; the Grand Rapids Public Museum, in Grand Rapid, Michigan and at the Museum of Lifestyle & Fashion History in Boynton Beach, Florida and the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City.

David I of Scotland was eager to extend the benefits of Norman influence and gave grants to the nobles of the south. Among them was Walter fitz Alan, who the Scottish king appointed his Steward in 1136. One of Fitzallan's followers was Richard Wallace from Oswestry who came north to try to improve his fortunes. Oswestry is on the Welsh border so it is possible that the name Wallace may be a corruption of Le Waleis meaning the \\"Welshman\\". However, while it is possible that the Wallaces were originally Britons from Wales, who came north with David I of Scotland in the eleventh century, another theory is that they were Britons who had settled in Strathclyde in the tenth century. The Steward received from King David lands in Ayrshire and so it was here that his follower Richard Wallace settled. Richard Wallace was granted his own estate in Kyle, where it is claimed that his name Richard is still remembered in the placename of the village of Riccarton. Richard Wallace (Walensis) held lands in Kilmarnock and was a vassal of the High Steward of Scotland before 1160. His grandson was Adam Walays who in turn had two sons, the eldest of whom succeeded to the family estates in Ayrshire. Adam's younger son was Malcolm Wallace who received the lands of Auchinbothie and Elderslie in Renfrewshire. =Wars of Scottish Independence= William Wallace Statue, Dryburgh. Malcolm Wallace appears in the Ragman Rolls of 1296 paying allegiance to Edward I of England, however later he was one of the few Scottish nobles who refused to submit to Edward and as a result he and his son, Andrew, were executed. According to some sources Malcolm was the father of the Scottish patriot William Wallace, however the seal of William Wallace, rediscovered in 1999, identifies him as the son of Alan Wallace of Ayrshire, who also appears in the Ragman Roll of 1296 as \\"crown tenant of Ayrshire\\". Dr. Fiona Watson in \\"A Report into Sir William Wallace's connections with Ayrshire\\", published in March 1999, reassesses the early life of William Wallace and concludes, \\"Sir William Wallace was a younger son of Alan Wallace, a crown tenant in Ayrshire\\". During the Wars of Scottish Independence William Wallace and Andrew de Moray began a successful military guerrilla campaign against the English. In 1297 they won a great and stunning victory over the English at the Battle of Stirling Bridge, after which Wallace was knighted as Guardian of Scotland. Wallace was also in command at the Battle of Falkirk in 1298, but there he was defeated by the superiority of the English numbers. Wallace was eventually captured at Robroyston near Glasgow and delivered to Edward Longshanks of England by a senior Scottish law officer ‚Äì Sir John Mentieth.

Castles that have belonged to the Clan Wallace have included amongst others: *Riccarton Castle, Riccarton, Ayrshire is named after Richard Wallace (Richard's Town).Coventry, Martin. (2008). Castles of the Clans: The Strongholds and Seats of 750 Scottish Families and Clans. pp. 586 - 587. . The lands were held by the Wallaces from the thirteenth century or earlier and they had a castle there. Malcolm Wallace, who is the father of the patriot William Wallace, is said to have been born there and a plaque now marks the site. *Wallace's Buildings, in the village of Elderslie, Renfrewshire is said to have been the birthplace of the patriot William Wallace, although there are other places that have also been suggested. It was a property of the Wallaces from the thirteenth century to about 1850. The buildings have now been demolished and all that remains are a grassy mound and a monument. *Craigie Castle, Ayrshire, four miles south of Kilmarnock dates from the thirteenth century and consists of a ruined hall house and castle. It was originally held by the Clan Lindsay but passed to the Wallaces of Riccarton in 1371. The Wallaces of Riccarton had Blind Harry collect and record stories here about the patriot William Wallace. The castle was abandoned in about 1600 when the Wallaces moved to Newton in Ayr. *Craigie House, near Ayr dates from 1730 and was built by the Wallaces of Craigie. It is a three-storey mansion with a bow-windowed front. It went to the Clan Campbell in 1782 and was sold to the local council in 1942. It later became a management centre for Paisley University and the grounds are open to the public. *Auchenbathie Tower, also known as Auchenbathie Castle, near Beith, was held by the Wallaces of Elderslie but now only ruins remain. *Busbie Castle, also known as Busbie Tower, near Kilmarnock, Ayrshire was held by the Wallaces but later passed to the Mowats. *Carnell Estate, near Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, was held by the Wallaces of Carnell. William Wallace of Carnell was killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. *Crosbie Castle, near West Kilbride, Ayrshire was held by the Wallaces and William Wallace the patriot is said to have sheltered here from the English in an earlier castle. *Sundrum Castle near Ayr was held by the Wallaces of Sundrum from 1373 or earlier.

Kelapa Sawit means oil palm in Bahasa Malaysia. A mainly Hakka community which was formed back in the 1950s when the British; who were the colonial masters of Malaya moved tens of thousands of the ethnic Chinese people into New Towns like this during the Malayan Emergency. Many of the older generations still keep up with tradition and communicate using the Hakka dialect. Located next to the Sime Darby palm oil plantation, this was the origin of the town's name. It faced some problems of air pollution until the estate's oil palm mill was closed down. Villagers were mainly reliant on agriculture for a living. Before tax on pepper kicked in in the 1980s, Kelapa Sawit was the famous Pepper producing town. Farmers has since relied on other crops such as Palm Oil, Durian and other leafy vegetables mainly targeted at the Singapore market. In recent years this town has transformed itself from a sleepy town into a tourist destination with murals, creative art works and traditional hakka food as their selling point. Many tourists mainly from nearby Singapore visit Kelapa Sawit as a quick weekend getaway. Schools Schools in Kelapa Sawit town include Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Sawit, Sekolah Agama Batu 26, and SK Polis Kem. SJK(C) Sawit was formed when 8 schools from nearby towns were relocated and merged during the emergency period. Transportation The only public bus service which serves Kelapa Sawit is the City Bus (Formerly known as South Johore Omnibus) service number 2 from Larkin Sentral to the town of Air Hitam.

Porphobilinogen deaminase is involved in the third step of the heme biosynthetic pathway. It catalyzes the head to tail condensation of four porphobilinogen molecules into the linear hydroxymethylbilane while releasing four ammonia molecules: :4 porphobilinogen + H2O \\\\rightleftharpoons hydroxymethylbilane + 4 NH3  Structure and function  Functionally, porphobilinogen deaminase catalyzes the loss of ammonia from the porphobilinogen monomer (deamination) and its subsequent polymerization to a linear tetrapyrrole, which is released as hydroxymethylbilane: Overall reaction of PB deaminase The structure of 40-42 kDa porphobilinogen deaminase, which is highly conserved amongst organisms, consists of three domains. Domains 1 and 2 are structurally very similar: each consisting of five beta- sheets and three alpha helices in humans. Domain 3 is positioned between the other two and has a flattened beta-sheet geometry. A dipyrrole, a cofactor of this enzyme consisting of two condensed porphobilinogen molecules, is covalently attached to domain 3 and extends into the active site, the cleft between domains 1 and 2. Several positively charged arginine residues, positioned to face the active site from domains 1 and 2, have been shown to stabilize the carboxylate functionalities on the incoming porphobilinogen as well as the growing pyrrole chain. These structural features presumably favor the formation of the final hydroxymethylbilane product. Porphobilinogen deaminase usually exists in dimer units in the cytoplasm of the cell.  Reaction mechanism  Full PBG Deaminase Mechanism The first step is believed to involve an E1 elimination of ammonia from porphobilinogen, generating a carbocation intermediate (1). This intermediate is then attacked by the dipyrrole cofactor of porphobilinogen deaminase, which after losing a proton yields a trimer covalently bound to the enzyme (2). This intermediate is then open to further reaction with porphobilinogen (1 and 2 repeated three more times). Once a hexamer is formed, hydrolysis allows hydroxymethylbilane to be released, as well as cofactor regeneration (3).  Pathology  The most well- known health issue involving porphobilinogen deaminase is acute intermittent porphyria, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder where insufficient hydroxymethylbilane is produced, leading to a build-up of porphobilinogen in the cytoplasm. This is caused by a gene mutation that, in 90% of cases, causes decreased amounts of enzyme. However, mutations where less-active enzymes and/or different isoforms have been described.

Examples include Google Wallet, PayPal, Yandex.Money. History English entrepreneur Michael Aldrich invented online shopping in 1979. His system connected a modified domestic TV to a real-time transaction processing computer via a domestic telephone line. He believed that videotex, the modified domestic TV technology with a simple menu-driven human‚Äìcomputer interface, was a 'new, universally applicable, participative communication medium ‚Äî the first since the invention of the telephone.' This enabled 'closed' corporate information systems to be opened to 'outside' correspondents not just for transaction processing but also for e-messaging and information retrieval and dissemination, later known as e-business.http://www.aldricharchive.com/papers/1982/Videotex%20Communications%20Dec'82.pdf His definition of the new mass communications medium as 'participative' [interactive, many-to-many] was fundamentally different from the traditional definitions of mass communication and mass media and a precursor to the social networking on the Internet 25 years later. In March 1980 he went on to launch Redifon's Office Revolution, which allowed consumers, customers, agents, distributors, suppliers and service companies to be connected on-line to the corporate systems and allow business transactions to be completed electronically in real- time.http://www.aldricharchive.com/cuttings/1980/ols%20may%2080.pdf During the 1980shttp://www.aldricharchive.com/downloads/anhc-33-4-anec-aldrich.pdf he designed, manufactured, sold, installed, maintained and supported many online shopping systems, using videotex technology.http://www.aldricharchive.com/cuttings/1980/ols%20july%2080.pdf These systems which also provided voice response and handprint processing pre- date the Internet and the World Wide Web, the IBM PC, and Microsoft MS-DOS, and were installed mainly in the UK by large corporations.

Immediately after, Amazon.com launched its online shopping site in 1995 and eBay was also introduced in 1995. Acceptance as a form of payment Due to slow adoption and high competition, there is currently no one standard online wallet that is universally accepted. The acceptance of the online wallet as a form of payment varies based on both individual store policy and the type of online wallet being used. For example, Google Wallet can be used at MasterCard Paypass locations within the United States.https://www.google.com/wallet/faq.html#tab=faq-card Conversely, Bitcoin, while accepted internationally, is much less frequently accepted, due in part to its connection to illegal websites like Silk Road (marketplace). Bitcoin can also be held in an online cryptocurrency wallet. It is predicted that in the near future, as the use of online wallets increases, consumer attraction to specific technologies will reduce the number of specific online wallets.

It is separated from Pulau Tekong and Changi Airport, Singapore by the Tebrau Straits.http://www.todaytourism.com/travel-guides/Pengerang-travel-guide.html Geology Pengerang has many natural resources, sea life and unique landforms. Geography Pengerang in Kota Tinggi District The PBT spans over an area of 184 km2.http://jpbd.johor.gov.my/images/jpbd_DokumenTerbitan/Handbook.pdf This include of several towns such as Desaru, Bandar Penawar, Sungai Rengit and Tanjung Pengelih. Economy The Johor State Government has picked Pengerang for a catalyst project for rural transformation program. Johor‚Äôs Chief Minister Datuk Mohamed Khaled Nordin said the area has seen steady development over the last few years as investments poured in because of the Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex. ‚ÄúWhen Pengerang was chosen as the location for an oil and gas hub it was not only to give a positive impact to the country but to also transform rural areas where the people will reap the rewards of development,‚Äù he said at a press conference after presenting 100 agriculture land grants at Taman Bayu Damai, Pengerang on 23 February 2015. Pengerang is well known for Malaysia's mega project named Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex (PIPC) which is sited in the area. The project was announced in 2011 and Pengerang was chosen for Malaysia's national project due to its strategic location. It offers access to existing major international shipping lanes (Middle East ‚Äì Singapore ‚Äì China) and proximity to an existing major trading hub (adjacent to Singapore). The Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex (PIPC) is one big step in creating value to the downstream oil and gas value chain in Johor and Malaysia. Sited in Pengerang, it is a national mega project located on a single plot measuring of 20,000 acres. Upon completion, the project will house oil refineries, naphtha crackers, petrochemical plants as well as a liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals and a regasification plant. The component of this mammoth project was first initiated with the development of the Pengerang Deepwater Terminal or PDT, a joint-venture between Dialog Group, Royal Vopak of The Netherlands and the State of Johor. Serving as a centralised storage facilities for trading, refining and petrochemical industry, the Deepwater Terminal is envisioned to have a storage capacity of 5 million cubic meters. The USD 3 Billion facility includes an independent terminal for trading, a dedicated industrial terminal for consumption of investors within PIPC and a Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal. The construction of a deepwater jetty facility with natural water depth would enable the berthing of both ultra large crude carriers and very large crude carriers. PDT received its first shipment of oil in the first quarter of 2014 and continues to cater to the growing demand for its services. The other component of PIPC is the Petronas‚Äô Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) which is PETRONAS‚Äô largest downstream investment in a single location to date, the development includes the USD 16 billion Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development Project or RAPID. This also involves the USD 11 billion associated facilities consisting of Air Separation Unit, Raw Water Supply, Cogeneration Plant, Regasification Terminal, Deepwater Terminal and Utilities and Facilities. Upon its completion in 2019, PIC will have a refining capacity of 300,000 barrels per day with petrochemical plants yielding an estimated production capacity of 3.6 million tonnes per annum of petrochemical products. The development of PIPC which received full support from the both state government and federal government will also benefit the local community by creating more access to economic opportunities other than the provision of public infrastructure and a complete infrastructure in Pengerang, Johor, PIPC also will create a total of 8,600 jobs in the operational phase by year 2020.

He was the first black person (not white or mixed race) to score a test try for the South Africa national rugby union team. Career Tyibilika was born in Port Elizabeth and educated at the Loyiso High School. While at high school he started playing rugby union, making his professional debut in 2001 with Griquas. Tyibilika played for Springbok 'A' in 2004. In November of that year he made his debut for the Springboks in a match against Scotland at Murrayfield playing at flank. South Africa won the match 45‚Äì10. He scored on his debut. He played in a subsequent test against Argentina in Buenos Aires, which the Springboks won 39‚Äì7. Tyibilika next played for the Springboks the following season in June, where he played against Uruguay, which the Springboks won 134‚Äì3. He then played a subsequent test against the Wallabies in the 2005 Tri Nations Series, which the Springboks won 33‚Äì20 at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. He earned one other cap that year against Argentina in Buenos Aires in November. He was named in the Springboks' 2006 Tri Nations Series squad. Tyibilika was part of the Southern Kings squad that played against the British and Irish Lions, in the Lions tour of South Africa in 2009. In the 2011 season, which would turn out to be his last, he played for Hamiltons in Cape Town. Tyibilika scored 24 tries for Griquas, Sharks, Lions and Border, appearing 158 times. Personal life Tyibilika was not married and had four children. Death Tyibilika was shot dead in a tavern in the township of Gugulethu, near Cape Town, shortly after 2pm on 13 November 2011. Witnesses reported Tyibilika had his back turned to the entrance and was on his telephone when two gunmen fired ten rounds in the door. Tyibilika was found to be lying lifeless in his own blood on the floor after the incident. Mr Oregan Hoskins, president of SARU, said, \\"Solly was a trailblazer among black African Springboks. To lose him so suddenly and in this brutal manner is very distressing. The casual disregard for life in our society is shocking.\\" Hoskins also said, \\"His emergence was a demonstration of what can be achieved when talent is combined with opportunity in what is always a very competitive position in Springbok rugby\\".

A genetic defect in the enzyme results in a reduced production of heme in animals. The medical condition associated with this enzyme defect is called hereditary coproporphyria. CPOX, the sixth enzyme of the haem biosynthetic pathway, converts coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX through two sequential steps of oxidative decarboxylation. The activity of the CPOX enzyme, located in the mitochondrial membrane, is measured in lymphocytes.  Function  CPOX is an enzyme involved in the sixth step of porphyrin metabolism it catalyses the oxidative decarboxylation of coproporphyrinogen III to proto-porphyrinogen IX in the haem and chlorophyll biosynthetic pathways. The protein is a homodimer containing two internally bound iron atoms per molecule of native protein. The enzyme is active in the presence of molecular oxygen that acts as an electron acceptor. The enzyme is widely distributed having been found in a variety of eukaryotic and prokaryotic sources. Structure =Gene= Human CPOX is a mitochondrial enzyme encoded by a 14 kb CPOX gene containing seven exons located on chromosome 3 at q11.2. =Protein= CPOX is expressed as a 40 kDa precursor and contains an amino terminal mitochondrial targeting signal. After proteolytic processing, the protein is present as a mature form of a homodimer with a molecular mass of 37 kDa. Clinical significance Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) and harderoporphyria are two phenotypically separate disorders that concern partial deficiency of CPOX. Neurovisceral symptomatology predominates in HCP. Additionally, it may be associated with abdominal pain and/or skin photosensitivity. Hyper-excretion of coproporphyrin III in urine and faeces has been recorded in biochemical tests. HCP is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder, whereas harderoporphyria is a rare erythropoietic variant form of HCP and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Clinically, it is characterized by neonatal haemolytic anaemia. Sometimes, the presence of skin lesions with marked faecal excretion of harderoporphyrin is also described in harderoporphyric patients. To date, over 50 CPOX mutations causing HCP have been described. Most of these mutations result in substitution of amino acid residues within the structural framework of CPOX. In terms of the molecular basis of HCP and harderoporphyria, mutations of CPOX in patients with harderoporphyria were demonstrated in the region of exon 6, where mutations in those with HCP were also identified. As only patients with mutation in this region (K404E) would develop harderoporphyria, this mutation led to diminishment of the second step of the decarboxylation reaction during the conversion of coproporphyrinogen to protoporphyrinogen, implying that the active site of the enzyme involved in the second step of decarboxylation is located in exon 6.  Interactions  CPOX has been shown to interact with the atypical keto-isocoproporphyrin (KICP) in human subjects with mercury (Hg) exposure.

It established a mutual intelligence gathering entity in China between the respective nations against Japan. It operated in China jointly along with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), America's first intelligence agency and forerunner of the CIA while also serving as joint training program between the two nations. The first and last operational chief of the organization was Dai Li (Tai Li, Dai/Tai is the surname), head of Chiang Kai-shek's secret police, the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics. A fierce anti-communist and shadowy man of mystery, General Dai also commanded the Loyal Patriotic Army (LPA), a large militia force active in Japanese- occupied interior regions of China. Commander for the American forces was United States Navy Captain Milton E. Miles. \\"Mary\\" Miles, later a Vice Admiral, was commander of Naval Group China (NGC), the American Navy's intelligence unit in China during the war. In April 1943, SACO began setting up camps (later known as units when Naval Group China was established) to train Chinese guerrillas in small arms, demolition, sabotage, combat techniques, radio handling, aircraft and ship recognition, and aerology. Many, if not most, of the American instructors had backgrounds in law enforcement prior to the war. While some of the recruits the Chinese provided were unhealthy to some degree, they surprised their instructors with their willingness and ability to learn. About 2500 sailors and Marines trained and operated with Chinese guerrilla forces, often behind Japanese lines. Among all the wartime missions that Americans set up in China, SACO was the only one that adopted a policy of \\"total immersion\\" with the Chinese. The \\"Rice Paddy Navy\\" or \\"What-the-Hell Gang\\" operated in the China-Burma-India theatre, advising and training, forecasting weather and scouting landing areas for USN fleet and Gen Claire Chennault's 14th AF, rescuing downed American flyers, and intercepting Japanese radio traffic. An underlying mission objective during the last year of war was the development and preparation of the China coast for Allied penetration and occupation. The Foochow (Fujian Province) was scouted as a potential staging area and springboard for the future invasion of Japan. In total, the guerrillas trained and supported by SACO/Naval Group China had destroyed more than 200 bridges, 84 locomotives, and 141 ships and river craft. Their activities were responsible for the deaths of around 71,000 Japanese military personnel, and the guerrillas themselves killed about 30,000- a rate of 2 1/2 Japanese for each weapon supplied to the guerrillas by SACO. This \\"kill ratio\\" was unmatched by any branch of the American military during the war. CAPT Miles deputy's estimate of Japanese deaths was a less generous 23,000.https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2018/12/30/how-naked- world-war-ii-sailors-ended-up-riding-mongolian-ponies-in-the-gobi-desert-to- shoot-bazookas-at-the-japanese/ The official SACO organization dissolved in 1946 after the close of the war, with the subsequent departure of the Naval Group China. However some KMT loyal SACO-trained guerillas continued aggression against the CCP during the civil war 1946‚Äì1949. For a long period after the Communist takeover, SACO became associated with imperial foreign aggression and atrocities of the revolution were attributed to sinister US involvement. The Chinese government memorialized incidents of torture and massacre at Chongqing former SACO HQ at Happy Valley, and displayed the \\"Gele Mountain Revolution Memorial Museum\\" in Geleshan, citing American supplied handcuffs and weapons in the exhibition as evidence of American involvement. The coalition was blamed for atrocities committed years after dissolution, with no acknowledgement of SACO's participation in the war against Japan. Only recently has the government taken a position to \\"restore history's original face.\\" The 1953 movie Destination Gobi is a highly fictionalized account of one group of weather observers.

It was directed by Stanley Tong and written by Tong and Steven Whitney. Synopsis Mainland China police officers Alex Lee and Darren Tong are working on a routine mission. However, miscommunication between the duo causes Alex to \\"die\\" when he is hit with a paintball to the head. The commanding officer commends the duo for trying their hardest, but they have to learn to work as both a team and separate units. Alex has a girlfriend, fashion designer Ruby, who is preparing a fashion show for her latest line. Meanwhile, Uncle Ma, an elder gang boss at the event, is about to score a major deal with a Japanese woman named Norika. Ma's nephew Tony speaks to Uncle Ma about having a friend come in to discuss business involving drugs. Uncle Ma does not deal with drugs and tells Tony that out of respect, he will meet with his friend, but will also deny his proposal. At the fashion show, Darren locks eyes with Norika, who despite sitting next to Tony, seems to have a bit of interest in Darren as well. A mysterious man named Coolio is also at the event and signals one of the waiters, Lee. Lee takes a knife and stabs Chong, one of Uncle Ma's subordinates, in the neck. Darren catches Lee and the two engage in a fight that takes them outside and onto a double decker bus. Norika walks towards Chong's body and grabs a disc from his pocket. Alex, noticing the theft, follows Norika to her hotel and finds her. He has police surround her, but she escapes when she grabs Alex by his tie and jumps to the lower floor, nearly taking him down in the process. Meanwhile, Darren catches up to Lee on a bridge. Surrounded, Lee jumps off the bridge and is supposedly dead. As Alex and Darren attempt to find out why both Chong is dead and Noriko stole the disc, it is revealed that Lee is Coolio's bodyguard and Coolio is the friend who Tony plans to introduce to Uncle Ma to start the drug market. When Lee demands the money for his killing Chong, Coolio shoots and kills him. As the duo begin to hatch a plan to start the drug market, Norika gets herself involved with the villainous duo as well. While working out a plan at a hot tub, Coolio suspects Norika not be who she seems to be. However, to prove herself, Norika strips down to nothing to show no wire. Tony trusts Noriko but Coolio still has his doubts. At the long-awaited meeting, Uncle Ma respectfully declines Coolio's offer to smuggle drugs in the market and suggests to Tony that the old man must die. When Norika looks for Uncle Ma, she finds his body and is caught by Alex and Darren. As Alex and Darren interrogate Noriko, Darren finds himself flirting with her much to the chagrin of Alex. However, Norika reveals her true nature. She is a Japanese Interpol agent who has come to China to track down her partner's killer, who turns out to be Coolio. She had used Uncle Ma because she knows that Coolio will want to get to Uncle Ma. However, as Norika is released, she seems flirty with Darren until she rebuffs him. Norika meets up with Tony and Coolio with Coolio admitting he set Noriko up to test her and she passed. However, Sheriff Lin, Ruby's father and Alex and Darren's superior, has arrived as well. He has been in cahoots with Tony and Coolio for a share of the money that the drugs will bring in. Sheriff Lin promises not to rat out Tony if he gets some more money so he can retire. When Tony agrees, Sheriff Lin informs Tony and Coolio that Norika is Japanese Interpol. Alex and Darren show up in time and a major fight ensues with Sheriff Lin getting shot by Coolio. Darren takes on members of Tony's gang, Norika goes one on one against Coolio, but Alex is outmatched by Tony, whose martial arts skills are impeccable. Darren arrives to save Alex, but proves to be too late as Coolio kills Alex by shooting him down. Coolio and Tony hop on to a helicopter and try to escape, but Alex and Norika go after the duo on bike to the helicopter. In the melee, Tony is killed and the helicopter crashes on a building, forcing Darren, Norika, and Coolio on a glass pane. Darren and Noriko fight Coolio until Darren drop kicks Coolio to his near death. Pleading for his life, Darren attempts to help Coolio. However, the helicopter crashes down on the pane, killing Coolio. The next day, Darren meets Ruby at the airport as she is leaving. Darren gives her a present, an engagement ring Alex had intended to give her before his death. Ruby is sad yet grateful to Alex for the ring. As Ruby leaves, Darren meets up with Norika and it is clear the two are attempting to start a relationship together. Production China Strike Force was shot in both Cantonese and English. The director Stanley Tong shot the film in Shanghai as the location as he found it cheaper than shooting the film in Hong Kong and he also wanted to get to know mainland China better.

It catalyses the reaction: :protoporphyrin + Fe+2 ‚áå heme B + 2 H+ 500px  Function  Summary of heme B biosynthesis‚Äînote that some reactions occur in the cytoplasm and some in the mitochondrion (yellow) Ferrochelatase catalyzes the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin IX in the heme biosynthesis pathway to form heme B. The enzyme is localized to the matrix-facing side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Ferrochelatase is the best known member of a family of enzymes that add divalent metal cations to tetrapyrrole structures. For example, magnesium chelatase adds magnesium to protoporphyrin IX in the first step of bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis. Heme B is an essential cofactor in many proteins and enzymes. In particular, heme b plays a key role as the oxygen carrier in hemoglobin in red blood cells and myoglobin in muscle cells. Furthermore, heme B is found in cytochrome b, a key component in Q-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex III) in oxidative phosphorylation.  Structure  Human ferrochelatase is a homodimer composed of two 359 amino acid polypeptide chains. It has a total molecular weight of 85.07 kDa.http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1HRK Each subunit is composed of five regions: a mitochondrial localization sequence, the N terminal domain, two folded domains, and a C terminal extension. Residues 1‚Äì62 form a mitochondrial localization domain that is cleaved in post-translational modification. The folded domains contain a total of 17 Œ±-helices and 8 Œ≤-sheets. The C terminal extension contains three of the four cysteine residues (Cys403, Cys406, Cys411) that coordinate the catalytic iron-sulfur cluster (2Fe-2S). The fourth coordinating cysteine resides in the N-terminal domain (Cys196). The active pocket of ferrocheltase consists of two hydrophobic \\"lips\\" and a hydrophilic interior. The hydrophobic lips, consisting of the highly conserved residues 300‚Äì311, face the inner mitochondrial membrane and facilitate the passage of the poorly soluble protoporphyrin IX substrate and the heme product via the membrane. The interior of the active site pocket contains a highly conserved acidic surface that facilitates proton extraction from protoporphyrin. Histidine and aspartate residues roughly 20 angstroms from the center of the active site on the mitochondrial matrix side of the enzyme coordinate metal binding.  Mechanism  Protoporphyrin IX with pyrrole rings lettered. The mechanism of human protoporphyrin metalation remains under investigation. Many researchers have hypothesized distortion of the porphyrin macrocycle as key to catalysis. Researchers studying Bacillus subtilis ferrochelatase propose a mechanism for iron insertion into protoporphyrin in which the enzyme tightly grips rings B, C, and D while bending ring A 36o. Normally planar, this distortion exposes the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen in ring A to the Fe+2 ion. Subsequent investigation revealed a 100o distortion in protoporphyrin bound to human ferrochelatase. A highly conserved histidine residue (His183 in B. subtilis, His263 in humans) is essential for determining the type of distortion, as well as acting as the initial proton acceptor from protoporphyrin. Anionic residues form a pathway facilitating proton movement away from the catalytic histidine. Frataxin chaperones iron to the matrix side of ferrochelatase, where aspartate and histidine residues on both proteins coordinate iron transfer into ferrochelatase. Two arginine and tyrosine residues in the active site (Arg164, Tyr165) may perform the final metalation. Ferrochelatase active site with protoporphyrin IX substrate in green. Residues shown are: hydrophobic groups holding protoporphyrin IX (yellow), anionic proton transfer path (dark blue), metalation residues (cyan), catalytic histidine (red).  Clinical significance  Defects in ferrochelatase create a buildup of protoporphyrin IX, causing erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). The disease can result from a variety of mutations in FECH, most of which behave in an autosomal dominant manner with low clinical penetrance. Clinically, patients with EPP present with a range of symptoms, from asymptomatic to suffering from an extremely painful photosensitivity. In less than five percent of cases, accumulation of protoporphyrin in the liver results in cholestasis (blockage of bile flow from the liver to the small intestine) and terminal liver failure.  Interactions  Ferrochelatase interacts with numerous other enzymes involved in heme biosynthesis, catabolism, and transport, including protoporphyrinogen oxidase, 5-aminolevulinate synthase, ABCB10, ABCB7, succinyl-CoA synthetase, and mitoferrin-1. Multiple studies have suggested the existence of an oligomeric complex that enables substrate channeling and coordination of overall iron and porphyrin metabolism throughout the cell. N-methylmesoporphyrin (N-MeMP) is a competitive inhibitor with protoporphyrin IX and is thought to be a transition state analog. As such, N-MeMP has been used extensively as a stabilizing ligand for x-ray crystallography structure determination. Frataxin acts as the Fe+2 chaperone and complexes with ferrochelatase on its mitochondrial matrix side. Ferrochelatase can also insert other divalent metal ions into protoporphyrin. Some ions, such as Zn+2, Ni, and Co form other metalloporphyrins while heavier metal ions such as Mn, Pb, Hg, and Cd inhibit product release after metallation.

He was a member of the Gregorian mission which went to England to Christianise the Anglo-Saxons from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism, although when he arrived in England is unknown. After Paulinus left Northumbria, James stayed near Lincoln and continued his missionary efforts, dying sometime after 671 according to the medieval chronicler Bede. Life James was presumably an Italian, like the other members of the Gregorian mission. The dates of his birth and his arrival in Britain are unknown.Blair World of Bede p. 98 He went with Paulinus to Northumbria accompanying √Üthelburh, sister of King Eadbald of Kent, who went to Northumbria to marry King Edwin. Traditionally this event is dated to 625, but the historian D. P. Kirby argues that the mission to Northumbria probably happened before 619.Mayr-Harting Coming of Christianity pp. 66‚Äì67 Edwin died in battle at Hatfield fighting against Penda of Mercia and Caedwalla in 633.Mayr-Harting Coming of Christianity p. 68 Edwin had been the main supporter of Paulinus' mission, and with his death, a pagan backlash set in. Paulinus fled to Kent, along with √Üthelburg and Edwin and √Üthelburg's daughter Eanfl√¶d. James, however, remained behind in Northumbria and continued missionary efforts. James' efforts were centred in Lincoln, at a church that Paulinus had built there, the remains of which may lie under the church of St. Paul-in-the-Bail.Brooks \\"From British to English Christianity\\" Conversion and Colonization p. 22 This was in the dependent kingdom of Lindsey, where Paulinus had preached prior to Edwin's death,Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 65 and it was reconquered by one of Edwin's successors, Oswald of Northumbria in the 640s.Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 74 Bede writes that James lived in a village near Catterick, which \\"bears his name to this day\\".Bede History of the English Church p. 139 He reports that James undertook missionary work in the area and lived to a great age. During the reign of King Oswiu of Northumbria, James attended the royal court, for he celebrated Easter with Oswiu's queen, Eanfl√¶d, Edwin's daughter. Both James and Eanfl√¶d celebrated Easter on the date used by the Roman church, which led to conflicts with Oswiu, who celebrated Easter on the date calculated by the Irish church. These dates did not always agree and were one of the reasons that Oswiu called the Synod of Whitby in 664 to decide which system of Easter calculation his kingdom would use.Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 87 James was present at the Synod of Whitby, according to Bede's account of events there.Lapidge \\"James the Deacon\\" Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England Bede states that after the synod, and the return of Roman customs, James, as a trained singing master in the Roman and Kentish style, taught many people plainsong or Gregorian chant in the Roman manner. James' date of death is unknown, but Bede implies that he was still alive during Bede's lifetime, which presumably means that he died after Bede's birth, sometime around 671 or 672. This would mean that he was at least 70 years old at his death. It has been suggested that James was Bede's informant for the life of Edwin, the works of Paulinus, and perhaps for the Synod of Whitby.Higham Kingdom of Northumbria p. 107 The historian Frank Stenton calls James \\"the one heroic figure in the Roman mission\\".Stenton Anglo-Saxon England p. 116 This reflects the fact that many of the Gregorian missionaries had a habit of fleeing when things went wrong.Mayr-Harting Coming of Christianity p. 75 After his death, James was venerated as a saint.

Dotaku were used for about 400 years, between the second century B.C. and the second century C.E. (corresponding to the end of the Yayoi era), and were nearly only used as decorations for rituals. They were richly decorated with patterns representing nature and animals, among which the dragonfly, praying mantis and spider are featured. Historians believe that d≈çtaku were used to pray for good harvests, as the animals featured are natural enemies of insect pests that attack paddy fields. According to Japanese folklore, d≈çtaku were used as emergency bells (such as a watch tower‚Äôs bell); intended especially in cases of invasion, particularly invaders from the Korean peninsula. When sentinels spotted invaders, they loudly rang the d≈çtaku as an alarm, so that people could hide themselves or their possession, and to alert warriors to prepare themselves to repel the enemy. There is a dotaku museumÈáéÊ¥≤Â∏ÇÔºöÊ≠¥Âè≤Ê∞ë‰øóÂçöÁâ©È§®ÔºàÊÑõÁß∞ÔºöÈäÖÈê∏ÂçöÁâ©È§®Ôºâ (in Japanese) devoted to the bells in Yasu city, in Shiga prefecture, in central Japan.  History  During the Yayoi Era (400 B.C.E. ‚Äì 300 C.E.), a great number of technological innovations occurred. Unlike the earlier nomadic J≈çmon people, the Yayoi emphasized having large community settlements and the cultivation of rice. Along with these, they learned how to cast bronze and iron in order to create various metal objects such as weapons, mirrors, and several tools. Among the bronze objects, dotaku, one of the most distinctive objects of the era, were created. In recent years, dotaku have been studied by researchers in order to decipher their origins, how they were created, their various purposes, and the reasons for the images on the main body.  Origin  Despite being a well- known artifact of the Yayoi era, the concept of dotaku did not initially originate in Japan. According to several studies, these bells are thought to be derived from \\"earlier, smaller Korean examples that adorned horses and other domesticated animals\\", from Chinese cattle bells, or Han Chinese zhong, which were bells without clappers used for composing ritual music. However, further studies show that the Yayoi did not have cattle farms, and although several dotaku do have suspension rings and clappers, they make \\"muffled tones\\" or \\"rattling sounds\\" when struck, suggesting that they were not meant to be rung. Therefore, any bells from China were imported as ritual objects. = Locations = In total, over four hundred dotaku have been found in Japan, mainly in western Honshu, the Tokai District, Shikoku, and the Kansai region, namely Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka. The \\"first recorded discovery of dotaku\\" was in 662 C.E. at a temple located in Shiga Prefecture. They are often \\"found buried on isolated hillsides\\" either ‚Äòsingly, [in] pairs, or in large groups\\" along with various bronze mirrors and weapons. When buried in groups, researchers have speculated that several clans each buried their only dotaku in one area to signify the unity of all the clans.  Appearance  Dotaku (bell-shaped bronze), Yayoi period, 2nd-1st century BC Physically, the body of a dotaku consists of \\"a truncated cone shape\\" with an oval cross-section and \\"has rows of horizontal bands divided in the center by a vertical row\\". Arching and extending over the top and the sides of the body is an \\"elaborate flange filled with sawtooth design and projecting spirals\\". The materials used for dotaku came from both Korea and China since \\"bronze resources were not found until the 7th century\\", thus bronze was considered more precious than iron. In addition, researchers have detected lead traces inside the bells, which was a common characteristic of Chinese metals. These Yayoi bells vary in height ranging from 4 inches to 50 inches, approximately 10 cm to 127 cm. In conjunction with the varying height, the styles of the bells also varied greatly. Across several regions, this scattered production continued until a group of bronze-smiths congregated and decided on a standard. = Making = These bells were originally made through the use of two-part sandstone moulds, in which \\"designs were carved\\" in order to create the appearance of raised bronzes on the outer surface. Many of these sandstone moulds were \\"found in abundance in northern Kyushu\\" and near Kyoto, Osaka, and Nara. As time progressed, dotaku gradually became larger in size and thinner due to the fact that they were now being made using clay moulds instead of sandstone. This allowed for more detailed work, such as simple line drawings, compared to the smaller and thicker sandstone moulds.  Main purpose  Other purposes of the dotaku are still being debated by researchers, but it is certain that they were used for agricultural rituals and rites, as supported by various sources. Researchers suggest that, when not in use, dotaku were buried \\"in the ground to receive Earth‚Äôs life force\\", thus ensuring agricultural fertility for the community; they were also believed to have been used to pray for rain. These beliefs and suggestions are supported by the fact that many dotaku had inscriptions of \\"flowing water, waterfowl, fish, boats, and agricultural objects\\" on them. Although it is unknown whether or not dotaku were \\"used by the chieftains for small principalities or by villages in public community festivals\\", it is certain that they belonged to the community as a whole rather than an individual. Some alternate theories include dotaku being used as \\"a sundial, producing gold, heating water for bathing, or related to secret Jewish practices\\", although these explanations have little support within the mainstream archaeological community.  Similarities with Chinese imagery  Regarding the designs of dotaku, they contain many aspects that resemble Chinese objects. For example, many early bells had \\"delicate decorations [that] resemble contemporary Chinese mirrors\\". It wasn‚Äôt until later in the Yayoi era that decorations \\"with scenes of animals and humans hunting or farming\\" were used. Along with these depictions, there are also images of the typical Yayoi \\"elevated granaries and scenes of rice being pounded\\". = Deer = Many depictions of deer appear on dotaku the most, even though the \\"Yayoi ate mostly wild boar\\". According to \\"Harima Fudoki\\", which is a series of reports comprised in the Nara period (710 C.E. ‚Äì 793 C.E.), there was \\"a magical ritual of sowing seeds in deer blood that was used to speed up the germination of rice plants\\" because it was believed that \\"the deer‚Äôs life force helped the growth of rice\\", which explains why the character Forest Spirit in the film Princess Mononoke was a human-faced deer.  Research  There have also been studies as to whether or not the images on the dotaku have significant meanings. According to a researcher named Oba, each picture contains a hidden pictograph that can be deciphered through a phonetic reading. For example, a picture of a man shooting a deer can be read as \\"iru ka\\" (to shoot a deer), but when combined to form \\"Iruka\\" , the pictures refer to Soga no Iruka, which is a reference to the Soga Dynasty. Through several more readings, Oba discovered that the drawings \\"contain references to precise persons, places, and events in Japanese prehistory\\" as well as provided \\"info of shapes of buildings, hunting customs, and other aspects of daily life\\", possibly left for future generations. However, due to a lack of concrete evidence, other researchers have deemed it improbable that the pictures are actually hidden pictographs; it is possible that the pictures are just pictures. Despite the lack of evidence, researchers do believe that the pictures aren‚Äôt just casual pictures drawn for the sake of art, that there is some other meaning behind them.  In popular culture  The deer, often depicted on the surfaces of dotaku, is physically manifested in the film Princess Mononoke directed by Hayao Miyazaki. In the film, Forest Spirit is a \\"god of life and death\\" and is characterized as a large deer with a human-like face. The Pok√©mon Bronzong is designed after a d≈çtaku.

It lies between the A37 and the A367 (which is part of the ancient Fosse Way). Oakhill is today is mainly a commuter village of in size, and is notable for former activities which including brewing. The village contains a Church of England primary school and a surgery, as well as a public house, the Oakhill Inn. Former businesses near the inn were a bakery, a butcher's shop and a smithy. Little London is the name given to a cluster of houses at the western end of the village. It is sometimes referred to by tradespeople etc. as a settlement in itself for the purpose of location, because of the elongated character of the village. Oakhill Methodist Church A brewing industry led to the growth of the village, and as a result a parish church, All Saints, was built in 1861 to a design by J. L. Pearson to provide a place of worship for the inhabitants, who previously had belonged to the parishes of Ashwick or Shepton Mallet, the boundary between which ran down the High Street. Its own small ecclesiastical parish was set up, with boundary stones marked OASCC (Oakhill All Saints Consolidated Chapelry). The village borders with the civil parish village of Ashwick. The 1825 Methodist chapel was once not the only such place of worship. There was also an Independent Chapel, built in 1872 to an ambitious design to replace a smaller Congregational chapel at Little London, and often dubbed locally the Little Cathedral. It is now converted to two dwellings, the Bell Tower (this was originally erected before the rest of the building) and the Round House. The now demolished mansion of Ashwick Grove was arguably closer to Oakhill than its neighbour. The mansion was the home of John Billingsley of Ashwick, the grandson of Nicholas Billingsley, a Presbyterian dissenter who was minister at Ashwick from 1699 to 1729. Billingsley is most remembered in the village as the owner of the Oakhill Brewery, established in 1761, and famous for its Oakhill Invalid Stout. The brewery owned two public houses in the village, the White Horse and the Moon, and the present Oakhill Inn, first mentioned in 1802, is probably the successor of one of these. The village had its own narrow-gauge railway, built in 1904, to take beer barrels to the Somerset & Dorset Railway at nearby Binegar. The railway had a 2'6\\" gauge and operated two 0-4-0T locomotives, the 'Mendip' and the 'Oakhill', which were painted in an olive green livery. Traces of the railway can still be seen in the surrounding area. The railways made a brief reappearance in the village of Oakhill in the 1980s, albeit in a miniature form. In the grounds of Oakhill Manor, the manor's owner, Walter Harper, opened a 'ride on' replica collection to the public. Among the engines, which towed thousands of people during their time there, was a 'Pacific' replica locomotive called Robin Hood. Oakhill Manor closed its doors to the public in 1985 and the engines are now elsewhere around the country. William Braine, an explorer on Franklin's lost expedition to find the Northwest Passage, was born in the village.

Clark has held simultaneous offices in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. His longtime writing partner Steve Zacharias wrote the definitive comedy Revenge of the Nerds. Together, he and Clark have written and produced new works while fostering young writers in screenwriting careers. =As Educator= For several years, Clark crafted, and later headed, the writing program for The Second City Training Center. Students and educating colleagues include well- known SNL/EMMY writer Joe Kelly , Conan O'Brien staff writer Brian Stack, Daily Show writer Allison Sliverman , Kevin Dorff (30 Rock, The Colbert Report, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno), Seth Meyers, Horatio Sanz, Amy Poehler and many others. While teaching and developing the program, Clark's collaborative and writing partner was Second City improv guru Martin de Maat. Their work in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago redefined teaching, comedic ethical value, tone and manner for a generation of students. Among de Maat's most notable quotes were \\"no one will follow you down the road if you are holding a banner that reads 'onward toward mediocrity'\\" and \\"You are pure potential.\\" Some of Martin de Maat's students over the years include: Mick Napier, Chris Farley, Tim Meadows, Rachel Dratch, Sean Hayes, Tina Fey, and a young David Mamet. Clark was a featured speaker at the Chicago Tribune's Printer's Row Book Fair (2001) along with Sheldon Patinkin and Saturday Night Live cast member Tim Kazurinsky. The trio were described by the Chicago Sun Times columnist Bill Zwecker as \\"Second City Improv Comedy Legends.\\" From 2001-2003, Clark served as Artistic Director and Educational Director at the Chicago Center for Performing Arts. While there, he contributed to the Players Workshop masters classes, teaching Writing, Directing, On-Camera Technique and other classes. An avid traveller for much of his life, Clark held a longtime interest in the Galapagos Islands, culminating in a residency on San Cristobal Island beginning in the summer of 2005. Invited by the Galapagos Marine Ecology team at the University of Arizona, Tucson, Clark, along with a group of 12 secondary and post-secondary teachers, worked with residents of several island communities to teach English to local school children. Clark and Karen Ford-Manza Tompson, former Executive Director of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill in Kansas and current Executive Director at Arizona Family Planning Council, co-authored a work regarding tectonic plate movement which was later reviewed by Rice University Staff (Linked below) The paper was entitled \\"The Geology and Vulcanology of the Galapagos Islands\\". =Professorship at DePaul University= For several years, Clark taught screenwriting and ethics part-time at DePaul University's School of Cinema and Digital Media before accepting a full-time position with the university's College of Communications. There, he teaches Documentary Production, Ethics in Cinema and Gaming, and Media Ethics. As a faculty member, he created and sponsored an extra-curricular creative writing workshop for students called Acting Out. The workshop's goal was to create and polish scripts that could then be optioned for free by the school's production-focused students. In 2010, Clark partnered with Patricia Werhane, formerly the Ruffin Professor of Business Ethics at Darden, to plan a new venture. She now holds a joint appointment at Darden and at DePaul University, where she is Wicklander Chair in Business Ethics and Director of the Institute for Business and Professional Ethics. Her latest book is Alleviating Poverty Through Profitable Partnerships with Routledge. This team is creating global poverty awareness and preparing to send a team to produce and direct documentary film projects to raise public awareness of micro-lending in Bangladesh. The Bangladesh segment of the project begins with IIRD (Institute of Integrated Rural Development), an NGO with a stated mission to create a model of rural development that can be replicated in any area of the Bangladesh - one that will facilitate the creation of the strong society. The project's success thus far has led to an expansion of the project into other topics and locations, such as wage theft, the effects on families for incarcerating parents for non-violent crimes, and examinations of other international models of poverty solution in Tanzania and Haiti. Clark is also a frequent speaker at international ethics conferences. Recent presentations include: \\"Video and Pedagogy\\" for the International Society of Business, Economics and Ethics, in Warsaw, Poland, \\"The Many Facets of Trust\\" with Patricia Werhane, Laura Hartman, and David Bevan for the European Business Ethics Network in Trento, Italy, and \\"Documenting Solutions to World Poverty\\" at the 10th EABIS Colloquium (hosted by the Graduate School of Management, St. Petersburg University). =Fellowships and Chairs= Clark is the president of Harbor Arts, a Michigan Not-for-profit which has been responsible for dozens of public performances every year, and has featured new artists as well as some of the most popular performers in the world. Baritone Nathan Gunn, arguably the most in demand male singer in the world (Newsweek) sang under the Harbor Arts organization in 2008. In Spring 2009 they featured New York Metropolitan Opera mezzo-soprano Isola Jones, who has often been paired with Luciano Pavarotti and Pl√°cido Domingo. Clark serves on the Board of Writers in the Heartland‚Äî a residency program in Central Illinois founded to nurture emerging and established writers. Their mission is to provide a tranquil environment conductive to artistic production and intellectual exchange. Using retreats, sabbaticals and paid stays, candidates may be selected to complete work of merit at little or no cost to themselves. Writers in the Heartland is currently funding scholarships to develop the work of talented writers on an annual basis. Clark is also a member of the Advisory Board for Southwest Michigan College, which is active in the development of a new degree program in contemporary Theater and Performing Arts Technology. As planned, the school has announced that the degree will begin in 2011. In 2010, Clark was awarded the Wicklander Fellowship, which is given to full-time DePaul faculty for the application of professional ethics as the topics relate a particular field of research.  Writing and Directing  =Screenwriting= Clark has written two plays, Binding Arbitration and Girl Talk, both of which have been produced. In 2000, Clark premiered the original stage play \\"Girl Talk\\" at the Other Side Stage Festival on a co-bill with young monologist David Sedaris. The premiere fell in the same week Sedaris' book \\"Naked\\" hit the New York Times best seller list for the first time. He has created numerous comedic shorts with the Second City team, co-writing and directing with many contributors including director Gail Mancuso whose recent webisodes featuring \\"30 Rock\\" star Jane Krakowski feature a modern take on two of Hollywood's most iconic romance films ‚Äî Gone with the Wind and King Kong. Gail's direction includes on-camera comment as a part of the comedic fun. =Stage Directing= In 2005 Clark directed Tops or Bottoms, a play by Todd Logan featuring Judy Blue and Richard Shavzin. This new work went on the explore the interchanges of marriage and love over years if tune. In 2004‚Äì05 Clark directed a successful, significant and extremely ambitions presentation of Washington Irving's classic American Folk Tale, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, the story of a restless ghost, a scheming schoolmaster, an apprehensive heiress and a teenage girl who thinks demons are delightful. This musical comedy was written by Judy Freed, music by Elizabeth Doyle and lyrics by Owen Kalt. This production included two full casts performing the same show at the same time (one visually on stage with puppetry, and one as a Greek chorus orally interpreting the script, with full orchestra.) The production used a novel combination of puppetry traditions- Clark used bunraku, a Japanese form of puppetry, elements of Balinesian shadow puppetry, traditional stick puppets, and live actors to tell Washington Irving's classic tale of the scheming schoolmaster and the restless ghost. =Producing= Clark was producer of the Emmy Award nominated television series Oh, Grow Up (1999), and executive producer of the film All Good Things (2002). In 2003 Clark produced and developed The Grouch (based on Menander's The Dyskolos) with the creators of Urinetown, winner 2002 Tony Award for Best Original Score and Best Director, and nominee for Best Musical. Later renamed Wild Goat, composer Mark Hollmann and Chicago playwright Jack Helbig (both alumni of Musical Theatre Writers' Workshop at the Theatre Building Chicago) collaborated on the new musical set on the outskirts of ancient Athens, Greece. In Wild Goat, sparks fly when romance inflames two of the most dysfunctional families this side of the Oedipus clan. Composer Mark Hollman had previously won the 2002 Tony Award, the 2001 Obie Award and received two Drama Desk nominations for his music and lyrics to Urinetown and has helped to create some of Chicago's favorite musical theatre, such as Jack the Chipper, I Think I Can and KABOOOOOM! For more than ten years, Clark and his partner David Fink have executive produced the Chicago Improv Festival only revealing their financial support in 2007 at the annual CIF Masters Award Ceremony. The Chicago Improv Festival was co-founded by Frances Callier and Jonathan Pitts in 1998 as an educational forum. Over the years it has given voice to performers around the world, including writer/performers Tina Fey and Rachel Dratch (performing Dratch and Fey), Seth Meyers, Frances Callier and scores of other new creative comedy voices. The festival continues and grows annually.  Acorn Theater  In 2000, Clark and his partner David Fink purchased the old Featherbone factory in Three Oaks, Michigan, which once produced corset stays, and renovated it to house the Acorn Theatre. The name Featherbone stems from the Warren Featherbone Company‚Äîa turn of the century American family owned corporation that has far reaching effect on American culture, nature and arts. The theater is a 300-set multi-disciplinary performing space that features approximately 50 show per year, as well as regular weekly featured events. The theater contains a full Barton theater organ, bar, wine shop, and guest rooms for performers. Since that time, Clark has acted as artistic director, and has worked to revitalize downtown Three Oaks. In addition to the talent on stage, the Acorn Theater has been a proving ground for writers, dancers and directors including the prolific and well-known American stage director David Cromer . Mr. Cromer is now one of the country's top Broadway theater directors and was recently awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. These efforts have helped Three Oaks to be designated part of Gov. Jennifer Granholm's Cool Cities Initiative in Michigan. What began as a summer arts project, evolved into a Theater District with local Art House Cinema the Vicker's Theatre, a converted turn of the century livery building that now boasts a balcony, hardwood flooring and hand crafted practical arts to rival any venue in the hemisphere. First run programming brings foreign and independent cinema to the small-town of Three Oaks Michigan. Clark and Vickers teamed up to create the Sounds of Silents Film Festival, a silent film series intended to reinvigorate the history and relevance of early 16-fps frame rate films. These screenings featured original contemporary scores and were performed both in- and out-doors. Early in the series, a screening of The Battleship Potemkin was very favorably reviewed by Roger Ebert, who wrote, \\"It was the music, I think, along with the unusual setting, that was able to break through my long familiarity with Battleship Potemkin and make me understand, better than ever before, why this movie was long considered dangerous.\\" =Notable Performers= Over the past few years, the Acorn has presented many musicians, acts and troupes, including: Nathan Gunn (Preeminent Baritone/ Barahunk - latest CD \\"Just Before Sunrise\\"), Jefferson Airplane (beginning their \\"Woodstock Reunion Tour\\"), Peter Yarrow, Dan Tyminski (Grammy winner, of Alison Krauss, Union Station, and O Brother, Where Art Thou?), Judith Owen (Comedic Songstress - latest CD - Mopping Up Karma), Cowboy Junkies (Alternative ‚Äì Double Platinum Albums include The Trinity Session ‚Äì Natural Born Killers), Todd Snider (\\"Todd Snider's compressed story-songs are so vivid and knowing that they seem completely plausible\\" - Rolling Stone), Anne Harris , Steve Evans , Bela Fleck , The BoDeans, Autumn Defense, Richie Havens, Poi Dog Pondering, The Guitars of Spain, Pacifica Quartet, Tom Wopat, Howard Levy, Tom Dreesen, and many others. =Profile in The New York Times and Other Press= The New York Times authored a full-page profile of Clark and his longtime partner David Fink in a story entitled \\"A Getaway That Happens to Include a Theater\\" (Published: December 21, 2007). When asked about creating a small, influential theater project that has now set world class innovation standards, Clark said \\"It's like the first time you fall in love. You flip, through fear that you're doing it wrong, and confidence that no one else has had this feeling before in real life.\\" Once in a lifetime lightning does strike twice in the same place, as they were profiled again in a second article entitled \\"Our Town Stage for the Creative Set\\" also written by the New York Times. (Article referenced below.) \\"We're living our dream life,\\" he said. \\"It is just impossible anywhere else.\\" The Chicago Tribune featured Clark and Fink in a story entitled \\"From the ground up at The Acorn Theater, big-city acts thrive in small-town Michigan\\" on November 2, 2008. . The pair have been featured in Rick Kogan's popular weekly column in the Chicago Tribune Sidewalks, which has since been collected in two hardcover books. Clark and Fink are also frequent guests on Kogan's Sunday morning WGN-AM radio show, The Sunday Papers. The Acorn Theater itself was also profiled on HGTV show Building Character', as well as two of the network's other programs, Rezoned and Offbeat America.  2006 candidate for United States Congressional Election  On April 5, 2006, Clark announced his candidacy for Michigan's 6th congressional district, running as the Democratic challenger to Republican Congressman Fred Upton of St. Joseph, Michigan. Clark focused his campaign on improving education and jobs in southwest Michigan, as well as calling for a responsible withdrawal of troops from Iraq. In the general election, Clark lost to Upton, earning 39 percent of the vote.  Renaissance Weekend  In 2012, Clark and his partner David Fink were invited to speak and participate at the five-day Renaissance Weekend held at the Aspen Institute in Aspen, Colorado. Renaissance Weekends are structured to encourage the transcendence of political, economic, and religious differences by bringing together distinguished participants from a wide range of fields, including CEOs, entrepreneurs, Nobel laureates, and prime ministers. Past participants include Hillary Clinton, Al Franken, Stephen Colbert, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The Weekends are geared towards the establishment of an environment free of partisanship and commercialism, where \\"civility prevails.\\" Membership is by invitation only.

Resistance during this period took many forms. Significant parts of the resistance were formed by Polish and Soviet forces, some of which fought with Lithuanian collaborators. This article presents a summary of the organizations, persons and actions involved. First Soviet occupation In 1940, President Antanas Smetona fled to Germany, not wanting his government to become a puppet of the Soviet occupation. Soviet attempts to capture him were unsuccessful, and he was able to settle in the United States. In 1940, Chiune Sugihara, the Japanese consul in Kaunas, and his wife Yukiko disobeyed orders and saved thousands of Jewish refugees from Poland by granting them visas. In 1941, the Lithuanian Activist Front () formed an underground government, and following the June uprising, the Provisional Government of Lithuania maintained sovereignty for a brief period. Nazi German occupation Soviet partisans began sabotage and guerrilla operations against German forces immediately after the Nazi invasion of 1941. The activities of Soviet partisans in Lithuania were partly coordinated by the Command of the Lithuanian Partisan Movement headed by Antanas Snieƒçkus and partly by the Central Command of the Partisan Movement of the USSR. In 1943, the Nazis attempted to raise a Waffen-SS division from the local population as they had in many other countries, but due to widespread coordination between resistance groups, the mobilization was boycotted. The Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force (Lietuvos vietinƒó rinktinƒó) was eventually formed in 1944 under Lithuanian command, but was liquidated by the Nazis only a few months later for refusing to subordinate to their command.Peterson, Roger D.

ISSN 0024-5089 There was no significant violent resistance directed against the Nazis. Some Lithuanians, encouraged by Germany's vague promises of autonomy, cooperated with the Nazis. Pre-war tensions over the Vilnius Region resulted in a low-level civil war between Poles and Lithuanians. Nazi-sponsored Lithuanian units, primarily the Lithuanian Secret Police, were active in the region and assisted the Germans in repressing the Polish population. In the autumn of 1943, the Armia Krajowa began retaliatory operations against the Lithuanian units and killed hundreds of mostly Lithuanian policemen and other collaborators during the first half of 1944. The conflict culminated in the massacres of Polish and Lithuanian civilians in June 1944 in the Gliti≈°kƒós (Glinciszki) and Dubingiai (Dubinki) villages. See also Polish-Lithuanian relations during World War II. Also in 1943, several underground political groups united under the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania (Vyriausias Lietuvos i≈°laisvinimo komitetas, or VLIK). The committee issued a declaration of independence that went largely unnoticed. It became active mostly outside Lithuania among emigrants and deportees, and was able to establish contacts in Western countries and get support for resistance operations inside Lithuania (see Operation Jungle). It would persist abroad for many years as one of the groups representing Lithuania in exile.Kaszeta, Daniel J. Lithuanian Resistance to Foreign Occupation 1940-1952, Lituanus, Volume 34, No. 3, Fall 1988. Ed. Antanas Dundzila. ISSN 0024-5089 Lithuanian Freedom Army during the Nazi Germany occupation opposed German policies, but did not begin armed resistance. The armed struggle began in mid-1944 when Red Army reached the Lithuanian borders after the Minsk Offensive. The LLA became the first wave of the Lithuanian partisans, armed anti-Soviet guerrilla fighters. It attempted to become the central command of the armed struggle. However, the organization headquarters was liquidated by the Soviet security forces (NKVD and KGB) by April 1946. Many Lithuanian Freedom Army fighters joined Lithuanian partisans. Jewish partisans also fought against the Nazi occupation. In September 1943, the United Partisan Organization, led by Abba Kovner, attempted to start an uprising in the Vilna Ghetto, and later engaged in sabotage and guerrilla operations against the Nazi occupation. In July 1944, as part of its Operation Tempest, the Polish Home Army launched Operation Ostra Brama, an attempt to recapture that city. See also Polish‚ÄìLithuanian relations during World War II. As of January 2008, 723 Lithuanians were recognized by Israel as Righteous among the Nations for their efforts in saving Lithuania's Jews from the Holocaust. The total number of people who helped the Jews may be much higher.Procuta, Genius. How Many Rescuers of Jews Were There?, Tƒóvi≈°kƒós ≈Ωiburiai, Missisauga, Ontario, Canada, 1999-03-16. Second Soviet occupation Lithuanian partisans, known as the Forest Brothers, began guerrilla warfare against the Soviet forces as soon as the front passed over them in 1944, and continued an armed struggle until 1953. The core of this movement was made up of soldiers from the Territorial Defense Force who had disbanded with their weapons and uniforms and members of the Lithuanian Freedom Army, established in 1941. The underground had extensive clandestine radio and press.Lane, p. 58 Thousands of people engaged in active and passive resistance against the Soviet authorities. The various resistance organizations eventually united under the Movement of the Struggle for the Freedom of Lithuania (Lietuvos Laisvƒós Kov≈≥ SƒÖj≈´dis, or LLKS), issuing a declaration of independence in 1949 that would ultimately be signed into law by the independent Republic of Lithuania in 1999.Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania. Law on the February 16, 1949 Declaration by the Council of the Movement of the Struggle for Freedom of Lithuania, Law No. VIII-1021, 1999-01-12, Vilnius. The most famous of these partisans is probably Juozas Luk≈°a, author of several books during the resistance and the subject of a recent film. While armed resistance ended in the 1950s, nonviolent resistance continued in various forms (e.g. through Lithuanians living abroad, the Catholic press, safeguarding local traditions and the Lithuanian language, the SƒÖj≈´dis movement, etc.), until 1991 when Russia recognized the independence declared by Lithuania on March 11, 1990. Significance of February 16 February 16, the date that Lithuania first declared its independence in 1918, played an important symbolic role during this period. The call for volunteers for the Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force, the VLIK declaration of independence, and the LLKS declaration of independence were all made on February 16. This day has become a national holiday in Lithuania.

The units are named after John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh, and not to be confused with the rayleigh unit of photon flux, used to measure airglow, and named after his son, Robert John Strutt, 4th Baron Rayleigh. It has the same dimensions as momentum per volume. Explanation =Specific acoustic impedance= When sound waves pass through any physical substance the pressure of the waves causes the particles of the substance to move. The sound specific impedance is the ratio between the sound pressure and the particle velocity it produces. Specific acoustic impedance is defined as: :{\\\\underline{Z}(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{\\\\underline{p}(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\omega)}{\\\\underline{v}(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\omega)}} where \\\\underline{Z}, \\\\underline{p} and \\\\underline{v} are the specific acoustic impedance, pressure and particle velocity phasors, \\\\mathbf{r} is the position and \\\\omega is the frequency. =Characteristic acoustic impedance= The Rayl is also used for the characteristic (acoustic) impedance of a medium, which is an inherent property of a medium: :{Z_0= \\\\rho_0 c_0} Here {Z_0} is the characteristic impedance, and {\\\\rho_0} and {c_0} are the density and speed of sound in the unperturbed medium (i.e. when there are no sound waves travelling in it). In a viscous medium, there will be a phase difference between the pressure and velocity, so the specific acoustic impedance \\\\underline{Z} will be different from the characteristic acoustic impedance {Z_0}. =MKS and CGS units= The MKS unit and the CGS unit confusingly have the same name, but not the same value: * In MKS units, 1 Rayl equals 1 pascal-second per meter (Pa¬∑s¬∑m‚àí1), or equivalently 1 newton-second per cubic meter (N¬∑s¬∑m‚àí3). In SI base units, that is kg‚àôs‚àí1‚àôm‚àí2. :{\\\\rm 1~Rayl_{MKS} = 1~\\\\frac{N \\\\cdot s}{m^3} = 1~\\\\frac{Pa \\\\cdot s}{m} = 1~\\\\frac{kg}{s \\\\cdot m^2}} * In CGS units, 1 Rayl equals 1 barye-second per centimeter (ba¬∑s¬∑cm‚àí1), or equivalently 1 dyne- second per cubic centimeter (dyn¬∑s¬∑cm‚àí3). In CGS base units, that is g‚àôs‚àí1‚àôcm‚àí2. :{\\\\rm 1~Rayl_{CGS} = 1~\\\\frac{dyn \\\\cdot s}{cm^3} = 1~\\\\frac{ba \\\\cdot s}{cm} = 1~\\\\frac{g}{s \\\\cdot cm^2}} *1 CGS Rayl = 10 MKS Rayl. In other words, a CGS Rayl is ten times larger than an MKS Rayl due to the way they are defined. References T. D. Rossing, Springer Handbook of Acoustics, Springer, 2007, p. 60 L. E. Kinsler, A. R.

It is a colorless compound, like other porphyrinogens. Structure The molecular structure of uroporphyrinogen III can be described as a hexahydroporphine core, where each pyrrole ring has the hydrogen atoms on its two outermost carbons replaced by an acetic acid group (, \\"A\\") and a propionic acid group (, \\"P\\"). The groups are attached in an asymmetric way: going around the macrocycle, the order is AP-AP-AP-PA. Biosynthesis and metabolism In the general porphyrin biosynthesis pathway, uroporphyrinogen III is derived from the linear tetrapyrrole preuroporphyrinogen (a substituted hydroxymethylbilane) by the action of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen-III cosynthase. alt=Biosynthesis of Uroporphyrinogen-III from pre-uroporphyrinogen The conversion entails a reversal of the last pyrrole unit (thus swapping the acetic and propionic acid groups) and a condensation reaction that closes the macrocycle by eliminating the final hydroxyl with a hydrogen atom of the first ring. In the biosynthesis of hemes and chlorophylls, uroporphyrinogen III is converted into coproporphyrinogen III by the enzyme uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase. In the biosynthesis of sirohemes, uroporphyrinogen III is converted by two methyl transferases to dihydrosirohydrochlorin, which is subsequently oxidized sirohydrochlorin, a precursor to the siroheme prosthetic group. Medical significance If uroporphyrinogen-III synthase is not present or inactive, the hydroxymethylbilane will spontaneously cyclise into the structural isomer uroporphyrinogen I, which differs from the III isomer in that the acetic acid (\\"A\\") and propionic acid (\\"P\\") groups are arranged in a rotationally symmetric order, AP-AP-AP-AP.

Initially constructed and used as menhaden trawlers they were taken into service the Royal Canadian Navy during the First World War for patrol duty along the Atlantic coast. Following the war they were returned to their original service. Construction and design The seven vessels that made up the P.V. type were initially named William H. Murray, Amagansett, Herbert N. Edwards, Martin J. Marran, Rollin E. Mason, Leander Wilcox and Rowland H. Wilcox. The trawlers were built at three locations in northeastern United States. William H. Murray, Amagansett, Herbert N. Edwards and Martin J. Marran were constructed at Rockland, Maine. Rollin E. Mason was built at Essex, Massachusetts and Leander Wilcox and Rowland H. Wilcox were constructed at Noank, Connecticut. The seven vessels that made up the P.V. type were of varying but similar dimensions. William H. Murray and Amagansett were the largest of the seven. They were long with a beam of and a draught of .

Service history The seven P.V. type vessels were constructed as menhaden fishing trawlers for use in the Atlantic fishery. In January 1917, the Royal Navy demanded that the Royal Canadian Navy expand its patrol force to protect the shipping lanes around the Canadian Atlantic coast. However, the British had no intention of providing any of their fleet of trawlers or patrol vessels in support. As part of the Royal Canadian Navy's effort to increase the number of patrol vessels, inquiries were sent to the United States to acquire suitable vessels. Those inquiries resulted in the seven menhaden trawlers being purchased in New England. Commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy, they took on new names. William H. Murray became P.V. I, Amagansett became P.V. II, Herbert N. Edwards became P.V. III, Martin J. Marran became P.V. IV, Rollin E. Mason became P.V. V, Leander Wilcox became P.V. VI and Rowland H. Wilcox became P.V. VII. Their 8-knot speed made them more suitable as minesweepers and they were converted into such with the addition of a QF 12-pounder (76 mm) gun placed forward. Entering service in March 1917, the seven trawlers formed a minesweeping flotilla based out of Sydney, Nova Scotia for the remainder of the war until April 1919. In April they were disarmed and resumed their former purpose as fishing trawler. They returned to their former names as well.

Milk-Bone is a brand of dog biscuit. It was created in 1908 by the F.H.Bennett Biscuit Company, which operated a bakery on the Lower East Side of New York City. Originally named Maltoid, the biscuit was a bone-shaped treat made from minerals, meat products, and milk. Sometime between 1915 and 1926, the biscuit was simply named \\"Milk-Bone\\", owing to the high composition of cow's milk. In 1931, the bakery was acquired by the National Biscuit Company (now Nabisco). The biscuit was the only Bennett product carried over after the acquisition. Over the next few decades, the Milk-Bone was expanded to include a number of different flavors, such as chicken and beef. The marketing focus was also shifted from Milk-Bone being merely a dog treat to a product that promoted cleaner teeth and better breath. Nabisco, under the ownership of Kraft Foods, sold the Milk-Bone rights to Del Monte Foods in May 2006. Del Monte Foods renamed their pet products division Big Heart Pet Brands.

It was built by the British in 1848, as one of three semaphore towers in Malta. The tower was restored in 2005, and it now houses as a beacon to warn ships of their proximity to land, as well as a number of communication antennas. History The semaphore telegraph system was invented in 1792, and the British military authorities began to consider installing such a system in Malta in the early 1840s. Initially, it was planned that semaphore stations be established on the bell towers and domes of the island's churches, but the religious authorities rejected the proposal. Due to this, in 1848 new semaphore towers were constructed at Nadur on Gozo, and Gƒßargƒßur and Gƒßaxaq on the main island of Malta. Further stations were established at the Governor's Palace in Valletta, Selmun Palace near Mellieƒßa, and the Giordan Lighthouse near Gƒßasri, Gozo. Each station was manned by the Royal Engineers. Ta' Kenuna Tower was built on a hill above sea level, so as to be able to pass on signals to ships and other posts via a telegraphy link between the two main Maltese islands, and to communicate with the towers at Gƒßargƒßur and Gƒßaxaq. The semaphore system became obsolete with the introduction of the electrical telegraph, and Ta' Kenuna Tower closed in 1883. In 2005, the Nadur Local Council with the help of Maltacom (now GO) sponsored restoration works of the tower. A beacon to warn ships of their proximity to land, as well as a number of communication antennas were installed on the roof. The modern additions are mounted on the surface of the tower, and care was taken to preserve the historic fabric of the original structure. View from garden around tower Today, one can ask permission from the tower's watchman to go on top of the covered roof of the tower for a panoramic view of Gozo, Comino and Malta. The surrounding gardens contain a number of endemic plants. Architecture Ta' Kenuna Tower is identical to the towers at Gƒßaxaq and Gƒßargƒßur, consisting of three floors, each containing a single room. The floors are linked together and with the roof by a spiral staircase. The signalling equipment, consisting of a wooden pole with three movable arms, was located on the tower's roof.

It is the only UFC event held in Puerto Rico and was later released on home video. History UFC 8 was the first UFC event located outside of the Continental United States. It featured an eight-man tournament, and a UFC Superfight Championship fight between reigning UFC champion Ken Shamrock and Kimo Leopoldo. The event also featured one alternate fight, which was not shown on the live pay-per-view broadcast. The tournament had no weight classes, or weight limits. A 10-minute time limit was imposed for all matches in the tournament except Superfight and final (15 minutes). The event's matchups pitted larger fighters against smaller fighters, hence the term \\"David vs. Goliath\\". Local promoter for the historical first and only professional mixed martial arts event was Richy Miranda-Cortese, whose company Sports & Entertainment Ltd had to take local Government officials to Federal Court in order to avoid cancellation of the event by the Government. Among those government officials was Governor Pedro Rossell√≥ and Sports and Recreation Director Erick Labrador. The presentation of the event developed into a new boxing commission rules and regulations and Imposition of a banning Law that was later overturned after Miranda-Cortese fought it in court. The tournament championship fight featured Don Frye against Gary Goodridge, with Frye taking the victory when Goodridge tapped out. Just days before the show, the Puerto Rican government made a ruling banning the event. Two days before the card, Cablevision became the first major carrier, of what over the next few years would become nearly every major cable system in North America, to ban the show, stating it never expected to air UFC or similar type of programming ever again. The event is also notable as being the first MMA event to draw criticism, including Michigan politician Calvin McCard‚Äôs on site protests at UFC 8. These protests would spark the nationwide movement against MMA in 1996, spearheaded by Arizona Senator John McCain, which would later temporarily push the sport in the United States underground in 1997.

Fan said, ‚ÄúWe wanted to explore the tension and interplay of relationships in a collaborative, creative process, and the meaning of reimagination for these acclaimed composers.‚Äù Joel Fan performed the World Premiere of each of their works on November 18, 2017 at the Open Source Music Festival in New York, NY. Augusta Read Thomas & Bernard Rands: Two Thoughts About The Piano AXIS by Augusta Read Thomas - IMPROMPTU NO. 3 by Bernard Rands \\"Two Thoughts About The Piano was inspired by - and is a response to - Elliott Carter's Cat√©naires, from his Two Thoughts About the Piano. My work is entirely original and does not quote from or share music in common with Mr. Carter‚Äôs work\\".‚Äî Augusta Read Thomas \\"Augusta then composed a series of about thirteen chords that serve as a potent seed and source embryo for both her work and Bernard‚Äôs work... Each in our own way, we used these chords as the harmonic structure of our respective pieces without any further collaboration... Bernard also analyzed the note succession of the Carter and the order in which each pitch occurs until all twelve have arrived. He then composed his IMPROMPTU #3 using the rich harmonies referred to above in the slow sections and the pitch ordering in the alternating fast sections.\\" AXIS by Augusta Read Thomas and IMPROMPTU NO. 3 by Bernard Rands have been performed as separate works, and together as a single work. Joel Fan performed the world premiere of Rands IMPROMPTU NO. 3 on radio station WQXR in New York City on November 7, 2017, and as a part of Bernard Rands' Four Impromptus in Cambridge, MA on April 18, 2019.

Early life  Mona Maris was born Mona Maria Emita Capdeville. Some sources spell her last name as Cap de Vielle, while others give her birth name as Maria Rose Amita Capdevielle, Rosa Emma Mona Mar√≠a Marta Capdevielle, or Maria Rosa Cap de Vielle. Her mother was Spanish Basque and her father was French Catalan. Orphaned when she was four years old, Maris lived with her grandmother in France and was educated in a convent there, as well as in England and Germany. By the age of 19, she spoke four languages ‚Äî French, German, English and Spanish. In the April 1930 issue of Picture Play magazine, William H. McKegg wrote that Maris \\"has assimilated much from each country [in which she has lived]‚Äîcynical frankness of the French, the simplicity of the Germans‚Äîthe romanticism of the Italians, and the independence of the English.\\"  Film career  With Carlos Gardel, 1934 Maris' ambition to become an actress originated during World War I, when she was a student in Luders, France. She and her classmates wrote, directed, and presented short plays to entertain soldiers billeted near the school. After graduation Maris begged to go to England and her mother finally relented. In England she found a woman was given much more freedom than in either Spain or South America. She traveled to England under the indirect chaperonage of an Argentine family. Her stay was intended to last only six months, but was extended another two years. The Argentine ambassador in Berlin received a letter which led to Maris being introduced to the President of the United Film Association. Soon she journeyed to Germany, where she participated in Universum Film AG productions. She was given a screen test during which the camera was not loaded with film. A prominent director noticed Maris and offered her a five-year contract. She counseled with her grandmother, who reluctantly allowed her to accept. Maris' screen debut was in the German film Los Esclavos del Volga, directed by Richard Eichberg. (The book Hollywood‚ÄîSe Habla Espa√±ol says, \\"Maris' film career began with the 1925 silent movie The Apache\\", while a 1985 Associated Press newspaper article wrote \\"She first appeared in the British-made movie, The Little People in 1924.\\") Jorge Finkielman wrote about her performance in his book, The Film Industry in Argentina: An Illustrated Cultural History: \\"Her portrayal of the character Tatiana showed that she was an actress who could be expected to turn out noteworthy performances.\\" Joseph Schenck, president of United Artists, granted her the prospect of a Hollywood career. At the time she had completed just four films in Germany. Her Hollywood film career began with the 1925 movie The Apache. Good Neighbor Policy\\", Maris resumed her Hollywood career in 1941 with the film Flight from Destiny, and she informally advised studios on authenticity in films marketed to South America. Spanish, French, and German came easily for her, but in the early years of sounds films, her English was almost unintelligible. From 1931 to 1941, she starred in 19 Spanish-language versions of successful American pictures, which were produced by the Fox Film Company. Maris also appeared in seven English dialogue motion pictures for three studios. In 1985, Maris described her image as an actress. \\"They used to hiss whenever I was on screen,\\" she said. \\"I was always playing the heavy. Here (in Argentina) when they need a heavy, they get an English girl. There (in the United States), when they needed a heavy, it was the Spanish girl.\\" Maris remained active at age 81, in the role of \\"a disturbed, broken-hearted grandmother\\" in the film Camila (1984), which was described as \\"the most successful Argentine film in decades.\\"  Personal life  She was married twice. Her first marriage took place while she was working in Europe and dissolved before she traveled to the United States. She began an affair with Clarence Brown in 1931, and he reportedly proposed to her. Despite multiple sources listing them as being married, they were not, and the affair ended shortly after the proposal, with Maris later saying she ended the relationship because she had her \\"own ideas of marriage then.\\" She married Herman Rick in 1960. They divorced in 1969. Maris had no children.  Death  Mona Maris died in her native Buenos Aires on March 23, 1991, aged 87. She is buried at La Chacarita Cemetery.

Two House Theology raises questions when applied to modern peoples who are thought to be descendants of the two ancient kingdoms, both Jews (of the Kingdom of Judah) and the ten lost tribes of the Kingdom of Israel. The phrase \\"the two houses of Israel\\" is found in the .  Brief history  The United Monarchy of Israel became divided after King Solomon's reign passed to his son Rehoboam in about 931 BCE. Rehoboam refused to grant the northern ten tribes relief from Solomon's taxation and they subsequently formed their own autonomous nation in the north, making Jeroboam their king. The Kingdom of Israel (the Ten Lost Tribes) was taken into Assyrian captivity starting in 740 BCE, culminating with the seizure of Samaria in 721 BCE. Even after invitations to return, many years later, no large representation of the tribes ever returned to their former boundaries. Between 597 and 586 BCE, the Kingdom of Judah was taken into the Babylonian captivity. Cyrus the Great later granted Judah permission to return to their lands, which they did, but the Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars took a significant toll which included the Destruction of the Second Temple and exile from Jerusalem (except for the day of Tisha B'Av) and the renaming of Roman Judaea to Syria Palaestina.  Advocates  Advocates take the general position that the ten tribes of the Kingdom of Israel have become a multitude of nations since their exile by the Assyrian Empire (740‚Äì722 BCE) and lengthy migrations before and particularly after the decline of the Parthian Empire, 200‚Äì700 CE (also known as the Great Migration Period). It is believed by proponents of Commonwealth of Israel Theology (Commonwealth Theology) that the ten tribes are not yet rejoined to the Kingdom of Judah in any large representation. 2 Kings was written Cir. 550 BCE, indicating that the northern tribes had not returned 170 years after they were scattered and \\"swallowed up by the nations\\" Hosea 8:8. ‚ÄúTherefore the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them from His sight; there was none left but the tribe of Judah alone...So Israel was carried away from their own land to Assyria, as it is to this day.‚Äù - Excerpts 2 Kings 17:18,23c. Some small reunification with Judah is believed to have happened in antiquity and is well documented to be happening in recent history in the modern nation of Israel.  Opponents  Many opponents like The Association of Messianic Congregations claim that the lost tribes reunited with the Kingdom of Judah in the years leading up to and following Judah's return from the Babylonian Captivity in 537 BCE, hence they do not exist in the nations today other than in the form of the Jews, those scattered by the Roman diaspora (70 CE) and subsequent Christian and Muslim exiles in later periods. Other opponents claim that the lost tribes have been completely assimilated by and are unidentifiable in the nations of the world and hence could never have returned from their deportation by and into Assyria. Opposition also arises simply when Israelites are identified with people more commonly associated with Japheth, one of Noah's three sons. Some Two House advocates won't deny some aspect of this argument, taking into account a prophetic verse: Genesis 9:27a \\"God enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem\\" (RSV). (Shem was another son of Noah, but also the ancestor of the Hebrews, Arabs, and many other ethnic groups according to genealogies found in the Hebrew Scriptures.) Three of the major Messianic Jewish groups reject Two House Theology as being misguided at best, or at worst a Gentile cult seeking to make themselves appear as Jews. The Union of Messianic Jewish Congregations, the Messianic Jewish Association of America (an affiliate of the International Messianic Jewish Alliance) and the Messianic Bureau International all proclaim the Messianic movement as a movement for Jewish believers in Yeshua and forbid the teaching that gentiles may be of the lost tribes of Israel, or any reference to the two houses of Israel. This kind of thinking is best seen in the \\"Ephraimite Error\\"Silberling, Kay, Ph.D. \\"The Ephraimite Error\\", A Position Paper Submitted to the International Messianic Jewish Alliance. white paper, produced in 1999, which several Two House proponents have responded to: See The Errors of ‚ÄúThe Ephraimite Error.‚Äù These attitudes may come as a reaction to British-Israelism which is best epitomized by the Worldwide Church of God founded by Herbert W. Armstrong. Many in Messianic Judaism consider Two House teaching to be irrelevant and meaningless. Some would view Messianic Judaism's total avoidance of the issue and its dismissal of the Scriptures as a manifestation of Messianic Judaism's wide-scale avoidance of more important theological issues pertaining to the nature of Messiah, the composition and historicity of Scripture, and Messianic Judaism's engagement with modern society.  Earliest dispute  The earliest documentation of the dispute can be found in discussions taking place sometime before the 2nd century CE. The Mishnah records Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Eliezar disagreeing on various points in regard to the return of the lost tribes. The Babylonian Talmud (Mishnah) Sanhedrin 110b: > \\"The Ten Tribes will not return [to the Land of Israel], for it is said, > 'And cast them into another land, as is this day: just as the day goes and > does not return, so they too went and will not return.' This is R. Akiba's > view. R. Eliezer said: 'As this day‚Äîjust as the day darkens and then becomes > light again, so the ten tribes‚Äîeven as it went dark for them, so will it > become light for them.\\"Sanhedrin 110b. The quote from Rabbi Akiva, however, should probably be understood in light of his disappointed belief that Simon ben Kosiba (surnamed Simon bar Kokhba) was the Messiah who would liberate the Jews from Rome, return the lost tribes and usher in the long-awaited Olam Haba. The failure of the Bar Kochba rebellion convinced Akiva that the lost tribes would not return at that time. It is probably a mistake to take Akiva's statement as a categorical denial of a return at any time.  House of Judah  According to many rabbis and historians, the Jews are largely descended from the House of Judah, the Southern Kingdom of Judah, chiefly consisting of the tribe of Judah, the tribe of Benjamin, with some of the tribe of Levi.  House of Joseph  Some historians, and especially Two House advocates, believe the Hebrew Scriptures indicate that the Kingdom of Israel, sometimes referred to as the \\"House of Joseph\\", never returned from their Assyrian Captivity 1 Chr 5:26. The 1st century Jewish priest and historian, Josephus, writing near the turn of the 2nd century AD, affirmed that the Jews knew where the House of Israel had been taken captive a thousand years earlier: > ‚Ä¶the entire body of the people of Israel remained in that country [Media]; > wherefore there are but two tribes [Judah and Benjamin] in Asia and Europe > subject to the Romans, while the ten tribes are beyond Euphrates till now, > and are an immense multitude, and not to be estimated by numbers.Antiquities > of the Jews, 11.5.2, from The Works of Josephus, translated by Whiston, W., > Hendrickson Publishers. 1987. 13th Printing. p 294 While the multitudinous nature of the exiled ten tribes may be somewhat exaggerated in the opinion of many, it is highly unlikely that Josephus would pen an outright falsehood regarding the Median location of the ten tribes when such a statement could be vociferously denied by his fellow-countrymen if the ten tribes had at any time in the past reunited with the Jews following the Babylonian Captivity. As shown previously, the Talmud has Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Eliezer discussing the eventual return of the ten tribes approximately 900 years after the deportation occurred. For the advocate of the two house ideology, this is weighty evidence which indicates that the Northern Kingdom tribes of Israel did not return and unite with the Southern Kingdom of Judah prior to the 1st century.  Multiplication and re-unification  Two House groups also believe that many prophecies from the Hebrew Scriptures indicate that the descendant nations of the ancient Kingdom of Israel will be re-united with the descendants of the ancient Kingdom of Judah. They frequently reference Ezekiel 37 (as below) and similar prophecies: > \\"16 Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For > Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another > stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and for all the > house of Israel his companions: 17 And join them one to another into one > stick; and they shall become one in thine hand. 18 And when the children of > thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou > meanest by these? 19 Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will > take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of > Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of > Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.\\" (vs. > 16‚Äì19, KJV). They also frequently quote from the Book of Hosea (chapters 1‚Äì3). In the first chapter (verses 2‚Äì9) God instructed this prophet of the Northern Kingdom to marry a prostitute (symbolic of the unfaithfulness of the northern tribes) and then gave two of Hosea‚Äôs children from this union Hebrew names signifying his rejection of the northern tribes: Lo-Ruchamah (Unpitied) and Lo-Ammi (Not my people). In Hosea 2:3, the eventual reversal of this judgment was indicated by means of a change in these names; and an accompanying change in the meanings of the names: Ruchamah (Pitied) and Ammi (My people). Hosea was told (3:3‚Äì5) that the northern tribes would be scattered among the Gentiles, that they would be in seclusion for a long time and become too numerous to be counted; but that in the \\"latter days,\\" they would return in repentance and come trembling to their God and his goodness. Two House Theology probably becomes most controversial when the ramifications of the Hebrew prophets are taken literally. The prophecy most poignant in the controversy is Genesis 48:19 which indicates that the tribe of Ephraim, half-tribe of Joseph, would become a ‚Äúmultitude of nations‚Äù (peoples/goyim), sometimes translated as ‚Äúfullness of the nations‚Äù: > \\"But his father refused, and said, \\"I know, my son, I know; he also shall > become a people, and he also shall be great; nevertheless his younger > brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a > multitude of nations\\" (RSV). According to advocates of Two House Theology, the passages above present a problem to those who think that the Jews are representative of all which is left of the twelve tribes of Israel. They argue, \\"the Jews have not become nor have they ever been a multitude of nations\\". For a Two House advocate, a common answer is: \\"no large contingents of Northern Kingdom tribes have been re-united with the Jews of the Southern Kingdom, thus they still exist as various nations/peoples in the world today\\". Also, someone sympathetic to the Two House ideals may say things like, \\"the problem is not: the Creator of the Universe lied about Ephraim becoming a multitude of nations/peoples, but simply: we have failed to unravel the mysteries of who is who in the nations today.\\" There are others, who are more moderate in their approach to the Two House controversy, who choose to see it as an overlooked element in the eschatological restoration of Israel. They disregard the speculation and \\"pseudohistory\\" from British-Israel and other Christian Identity groups, adhering to Paul's directive not to pay attention to \\"endless genealogies which promote speculations rather than the divine training that is in faith\\" (1 Timothy 1:4, RSV). They leave scattered Israel as a matter to be determined by God, and prefer instead to recognize all believers as participants in its restoration. This growing position has gained sympathy with some in Messianic Judaism among those holding to the \\"One Law\\" position, where individuals can \\"agree to disagree\\" because the Two House teaching is a matter of eschatology, and thus not of a core theological nature. Still others will contend that seven-eighths of scripture is undiscernable without first understanding the two house reality, certainly making it into a core theology, and not simply a matter of eschatology. For example, Prof. C. A. L. Totten [1851‚Äì1908], of Yale University, was quoted:Judah's Sceptre and Joseph's Birthright, by Rev. J. H. Allen, Destiny Publishers. Seventeenth Edition, 1917, p. 79 > \\"I can never be too thankful to the Almighty that in my youth he used the > late Professor Wilson to show me the difference between the two houses. The > very understanding of this difference is the KEY by which almost the entire > Bible becomes intelligible, and I cannot state too strongly that the man who > has not yet seen that Israel of the Scripture is totally distinct from the > Jewish people, is yet in the very infancy, the mere alphabet, of Biblical > study, and that to this day the meaning of seven-eighths of the Bible is > shut to his understanding.\\"  Details disputed  Two House advocates generally agree on the big picture, but disagree on numerous details, especially when view points converge amongst Judaism, Messianic Judaism, and Christianity. Identifying specific nations and/or people groups is full of varying opinions and speculations. A great number of Two House advocates think that specific ethnicities can be identified with a particular tribe, and many others choose to let this be decided in the eschaton. Because of the newness of this theological movement, many advocates point out that these issues will have to be worked out over time.  Replacement theology?  Advocates of Two House Theology wish not to be confused with Replacement Theology or Supersessionism.

Abbensetts was further inspired when he went to England and visited the Royal Court Theatre, Britain's premier theatre of new writing, where he was soon to become resident dramatist. Sweet Talk, Abbensetts' first play, was performed there in 1973, with a cast including Mona Hammond and Don Warrington, directed by Stephen Frears.Stephen Bourne, \\"The Black Presence on the London Stage, 1825‚Äì1965: Some Key Players and a Timeline\\". In the same year, The Museum Attendant, his first television play, was broadcast on BBC2.

He is best known for his books The Science of Happiness and Time: A User's Guide. His works have been translated into 25 languages and became best sellers in many countries.List of translations on author's homepage Life and work Klein was born in Munich, Germany. Both his parents were chemists and had immigrated from Austria; their ancestors had been scientists for three generations. Klein studied physics and analytical philosophy at the University of Munich and Grenoble and graduated in theoretical biophysics at the University of Freiburg, Germany. He left his academic career to become science editor at Der Spiegel, a newsmagazine, in 1996, and made quickly made a name for himself through a series of ten highly regarded cover stories. Klein's 2000 Book \\"Die Tageb√ºcher der Sch√∂pfung\\" is a collection of these stories He was awarded the Georg von Holtzbrinck Preis, a prestigious German prize for science writing in 1998. After a stint at Geo, a popular scientific magazine, he has worked as a freelance author since 2000. His 2002 book The Science of Happiness is a synthesis of findings from neuroscience, social psychology and philosophy on how positive emotions can arise in the human brain. Klein explains Happiness as an automatic signal the brain uses to mark situations promising a benefit for the organism. As it is triggered when a given situation appears better relative to a previous state, no external conditions whatever can account for lasting happiness. However, Klein believes subjective well-being can be raised by training the awareness for positive emotions when they are generated in the brain. . Alison Abbott from Nature Magazine called The Science of Happiness \\"an extremely well-written, easy-to-read and expertly researched book on a theme which has long been begging for pop-science treatment\\". It was on the German bestseller list for more than a year. In The Secret Pulse of Time (2006), Klein explored the human capacity to perceive time. It describes most people's constant difficulties in dealing efficiently with time as a consequence of the brain's organisation: Awareness for time and the ability to follow one's plans are functions of highly evolved and vulnerable cognitive mechanisms. Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a German national newspaper, characterized this book as 'a protest against the deeply unfair fact that memorable time flies by whereas unbearable time stumbles'. Library Journal elected its English translation as one of the best science books in 2007 . Klein has advocated for novel ways to communicate science. In his view, science should rather be told as stories rather than by teaching facts. He also opposed the unique use of English as a language of science and argued that it would be better to teach science in national languages, at least at an undergraduate level. His essays were published by leading German newspapers and by various English-language media such as the New York Times and Nature. Klein lives in Berlin. He is married and has two daughters and one son.

He discovered \\"active nitrogen\\" and was the first to distinguish the glow of the night sky. Early life and education Strutt was born at Terling Place, the family home near Witham, Essex, the eldest son of John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh and his wife Evelyn Georgiana Mary (n√©e Balfour). He was thus a nephew of Arthur Balfour and of Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he initially read mathematics, but changed after two terms to Natural Sciences.A. C. Egerton, 'Strutt, Robert John, fourth Baron Rayleigh (1875‚Äì1947)', rev. Isobel Falconer He became a research student in physics at the Cavendish Laboratory under J. J. Thomson, whose biography he subsequently wrote.Lord Rayleign (1942) The Life of Sir J. J. Thomson Cambridge University Press His work at this time was on discharge of electricity through gases, including early work on x-rays and electrons. He wrote one of the first books on radioactivity, The Becquerel rays and the properties of radium (E. Arnold, 1904). He was awarded the Coutts Trotter studentship in 1898 and was a Fellow of Trinity College 1900‚Äì1906. He received his M.A. in 1901. Career Strutt was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1905 when his candidature citation read: \\"Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. As one who has made discoveries in Physics and as the author of the following papers: ‚Äì 'On the Least Potential Difference required to Produce Discharge through Various Gases' (Phil Trans, vol cxciii, 1893); 'The Dispersion of the Cathode Rays by Magnetic Gases' (Phil Mag,, Nov 1899); 'The Discharge of Electricity through Argon and helium' (ibid, March 1900); 'The Behaviour of Becquerel and Rontgen Rays in a Magnetic Field' (Proc Roy Soc, vol lxvi); 'The Conductivity of Gases under Becquerel Rays' (Phil Trans, vol cxcvi, 1901); 'The Tendency of the Atomic Weights to Approximate to Whole Numbers' (Phil Mag,, March 1901); 'The Discharge of Positive Electrification by Hot Metals' (ibid, July 1902); 'Electrical Conductivity of Metals and their Vapours' (ibid, Nov 1902); 'Some Recent Investigations on Electrical Conduction' (Proc Roy Inst, April 1903); 'Preparation and Properties of an Intensely Radio-active Gas from Metallic Mercury' (Phil Mag, July 1903); 'Radio-activity of Ordinary Materials' (ibid, June 1903); 'Absorption of Light by Mercury and its Vapour' (ibid, July 1903); 'The Intensely Penetrating Rays of radium' (Proc Roy Soc, lxxii); 'Fluorescence of Crystals under Rontgen Rays' (Phil Mag, Aug 1903); 'An Experiment to Exhibit the Loss of Negative Electricity by Radium' (ibid, Nov 1903).. He delivered their Bakerian Lecture in 1911 and 1919. He was president of the British Association for the year 1937‚Äì1938. Strutt's best known work in the period 1904‚Äì1910 was the estimation of the age of minerals and rocks by measurement of their radium and helium content. In 1908 he was appointed Professor of Physics at Imperial College, London where he followed up his father's work on light scattering, which is now known as Rayleigh scattering, resulting in some papers published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. He published a biography of his father, the third Baron Rayleigh, with the title of \\"Life of John William Strutt, third Baron Rayleigh\\". Photographs of Robert John Strutt when he was young can be found in this book. Both the father and son's work on light scattering was discussed by Young in 1982. A sketch of Robert John Strutt when he was old can also be found in Young (1982). (Please see reference.) In 1910 Robert Strutt discovered that an electrical discharge in nitrogen gas produced \\"active nitrogen\\", an allotrope considered to be monatomic. The \\"whirling cloud of brilliant yellow light\\" produced by his apparatus reacted with quicksilver to produce explosive mercury nitride. In 1916, working with his colleague Alfred Fowler, Strutt was the first to prove the existence of ozone in the atmosphere by examining the ultra-violet spectrum of the setting sun. Strutt proved that the ozone was mainly located in the upper atmosphere, in what is now called the ozone layer. Following the death of his father in 1919, Strutt resigned his chair at Imperial College but continued to experiment at home in the private laboratory that his father had established in an old stable block.Robert John Strutt (1924)The Life of John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh Edward Arnold His earlier work on gaseous discharge and fluorescence, led to further work on the luminosity of the night sky. He was the first to differentiate between two types of light from the night sky, the aurora or \\"northern lights\\", and the airglow that prevents the sky ever being completely dark anywhere on earth. In 1929 he was the first to measure the intensity of the light from the night sky. This work led to his posthumous nickname \\"the Airglow Rayleigh\\". The importance of his unpublished data was such that the US Airforce Cambridge Research Laboratories acquired it in 1963, almost by accident, at the same time of many of his father's experimental notebooks. They are now housed in the McDermott Library of the US Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado. The rayleigh, a unit of photon flux used to measure airglow, is named after him. A special issue of Applied Optics published in 1964 is devoted to the 3rd and 4th Barons Rayleigh. Personal life Strutt inherited his title on the death of his father in 1919, becoming the 4th Baron Rayleigh. He had married twice: firstly on 5 July 1905 Lady Mary Hilda Clements, daughter of Robert Clements, 4th Earl of Leitrim (she died 1919), and secondly, in 1920, Kathleen Alice, daughter of John Coppin-Straker of Northumberland. He had five children (including one who died in childhood) by his first wife, including his heir John Arthur Strutt, 5th Baron Rayleigh and the Hon.

In 1948 Special Committee 31 recommended that a common air traffic control system be developed for all aircraft flown in the United States. Requirements for membership include a fee that is based on information in the application for membership, and an interest in aviation.

Guidance documents are developed and drafted by Special Committee (SC) and are based on a consensus developed within the SC charged with responsibility for the given document. Despite the loosely defined requirements of membership in RTCA, the guidance documents are based on expert technical opinion. RTCA's objectives include but are not limited to: * ensuring the safety and reliability of airborne systems; * developing minimum operational performance requirements for document-specific systems; * developing guidelines for use by a regulatory authority, the given authority determines appropriate; * providing administrative and logistics resources that enable teamwork among the worldwide aviation community (e.g., International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Telecommunication Union and others).

Brooks/Cole Publishing Company: Pacific Grove, CA. They released a final report of their recommendations on May 12, 1948; this report made several requirements of future air traffic control systems (as listed in ): #The new system must permit aircraft to be flown safely. #It must improve the flow of air traffic. #Any airborne equipment must be both simple and lightweight. #Any new system must impose a minimum burden on the pilot or ground personnel. #The installed equipment must require a minimum of funding from taxpayers, airlines, or private pilots. To meet these requirements the report recommended installation of airport surveillance radar and installation of VHF omnidirectional range (VOR)/distance measuring equipment (DME) on aircraft. In addition the report made several other recommendations such as installing transponders to aircraft to provide altitude and identification information to ground-based radar and to install precision approach radar to improve the capability of aircraft to land in poor weather conditions. In 1948 the Air Navigation Development Board (ANDB) was formed to oversee the implementation of the ATC system described in SC-31. There were immediate problems such as budgetary restraints (from the ongoing war) and a concurrent effort by the military to pursue an incompatible system (Tactical Air Navigation; TACAN). In general though, the SC-31 was instrumental in laying the groundwork for the next-generation air traffic system.

Rather than have dedicated servers for each of the aforementioned functionality realms, Virtuoso is a \\"universal server\\"; it enables a single multithreaded server process that implements multiple protocols. The free and open source edition of Virtuoso Universal Server is also known as OpenLink Virtuoso. The software has been developed by OpenLink Software with Kingsley Uyi Idehen and Orri Erling as the chief software architects.  Database structure  = Core database engine = Virtuoso provides an extended object-relational model, which combines the flexibility of relational access with inheritance, run time data typing, late binding, and identity-based access. Virtuoso Universal Server database includes physical file and in memory storage and operating system processes that interact with the storage. There is one main process, which has listeners on a specified port for HTTP, SOAP, and other protocols.  Architecture  Virtuoso is designed to take advantage of operating system threading support and multiple CPUs. It consists of a single process with an adjustable pool of threads shared between clients. Multiple threads may work on a single index tree with minimal interference with each other. One cache of database pages is shared among all threads and old dirty pages are written back to disk as a background process. The database has at all times a clean checkpoint state and a delta of committed or uncommitted changes to this checkpointed state. This makes it possible to do a clean backup of the checkpoint state while transactions proceed on the commit state. A transaction log file records all transactions since the last checkpoint. Transaction log files may be preserved and archived for an indefinite time, providing a full, recoverable history of the database. A single set of files is used for storing all tables. A separate set of files is used for all temporary data. The maximum size of a file set is 32 terabytes, for 4G √ó 8K pages.  Locking  Virtuoso provides dynamic locking, starting with row level locks and escalating to page level locks when a cursor holds a large percentage of a page's rows or when it has a history of locking entire pages. Lock escalation only happens when no other transactions hold locks on the same page, hence it never deadlocks. Virtuoso SQL provides means for exclusive read and for setting transaction isolation.  Transactions  All four levels of isolation are supported: Dirty read, read committed, repeatable read and serializable. The level of isolation may be specified operation by operation within a single transaction. Virtuoso can also act as a resource manager and/or transaction coordinator under Microsoft's Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC) or the XA standard.  Data integrity  Virtuoso ORDBMS database supports entity integrity and referential integrity. Virtuoso ensures that relationships between records in related tables are valid by enforcing referential integrity. Integrity constraints include: * NOT NULL ‚Äì Within the definition of a table, Virtuoso allows data to contain a NULL value. This NULL value is not really a value at all and is considered an absence of value. The constraint of NOT NULL forces a value to be given to a column. * Unique key ‚Äì Uniqueness for a column or set of columns means that the values in that column or set of columns must be different from all other columns or set of columns in that table. A unique key may contain NULL values since they are by definition a unique non-valued value. * Primary key ‚Äì Primary key are much like unique keys except that they are designed to uniquely identify a row in a table. They can consist of a single column or multiple columns. The primary key cannot contain a NULL value. * CHECK Constraint - Virtuoso provides on a column an integrity constraint that requires certain conditions to be met before the data is inserted or modified. If the checks are not satisfied then the transaction cannot be completed.  Data dictionary  Virtuoso stores all its information about all user objects in the database in the system catalog tables designated by db.dba*. = Components and files =  Components  Virtuoso is made up of client and server components. These components typically communicate with a local or remote Virtuoso server, which include: * Virtuoso Drivers for ODBC, JDBC, ADO.NET and OLE DB * Conductor, a web-based database administration user interface * ISQL (Interactive SQL) and ISQO Utilities * Documentation and Tutorials * Samples Installations come with two databases: a default and a demo database.  History  The Virtuoso project was born in 1998 from a merger of the OpenLink data access middleware and Kubl RDBMS. = Kubl RDBMS = The Kubl ORDBMS was one of a list of relational database systems with roots in Finland. This list also includes MySQL, InnoDB, and Solid RDBMS/Solid Technologies. As is the case with most technology products, key personnel behind OpenLink Virtuoso, InnoDB, and Solid share periods of professional overlap that provide noteworthy insight into the history of database technology development in Finland. Heikki Tuuri (creator of InnoDB), Ora Lassila (W3C and Nokia Research, a technology lead and visionary in the areas RDF and Semantic Web in general alongside Tim Berners- Lee), and Orri Erling (Virtuoso Program Manager at OpenLink Software) all worked together in a startup company called Entity Systems in Finland - where they were developing Common Lisp and Prolog development environments for the early generation of PC's circa. 1986‚Äì88. Later, Orri Erling worked with VIA International, the developer of VIA/DRE in designing a LISP-based object- oriented data access layer atop the company's DBMS product. The core development team of VIA, following the company's demise in 1992, went on to found Solid Technologies under the direction of Artturi Tarjanne. Heikki Tuuri worked at Solid for a while before starting his own database development project which became InnoDB (acquired by Oracle in 2005). Orri Erling started his own DBMS development work in 1994, which was to become Kubl. Development of Kubl was initially financed by Infosto Group, publisher of Finland's largest free ads paper, as part of their in-house software development project for their on-line services. The on-line version of Keltainen P√∂rssi was at one time said to be Finland's most popular web site with 500,000 registered users. The Kubl database was prominently displayed in a \\"Powered by Kubl\\" logo on the search results. A free trial version of Kubl was made available for download on November 7, 1996. Kubl was marketed as a high performance lightweight database for embedded use; the development aim was to achieve top scores in Transactions Per Second tests. Pricing of the product was especially favorable to Linux users with a Linux license priced at $199. Kubl became the cornerstone of OpenLink Virtuoso, after the technology paths of Kingsley Uyi Idehen and Orri Erling crossed in 1998, leading to the acquisition of Kubl by OpenLink Software.  Functionality realms  Virtuoso's functionality covers a broad range of traditionally distinct realms in a single product offering. These functional realms include: * Object-relational database engine for (SQL, XML, RDF and plain text) * Web services computing platform * Web application server * Web content management system (WCMS) * NNTP-based discussion management * Replication of homogeneous and heterogeneous data * Mail Storage Sink and (POP3) service proxy * DataPortability = Protocols implemented = Virtuoso supports a broad range of industry standard Web & Internet protocols that includes: HTTP, WebDAV, CalDAV, CardDAV, SOAP, UDDI, WSDL, WS-Policy, WS- Security, WS-ReliableMessaging, WS-Routing, WS-Referral, WS-Attachment, WS- BPEL, SyncML, GData, SPARQL, SPARUL, NNTP = API support = For the database application developer and systems integrator, Virtuoso implements a variety of industry standard data access APIs (client and server) that includes: ODBC, JDBC, OLE DB, ADO.NET, ADO.NET Entity Framework, XMLA. = Content syndication and interchange format support = For the Web application developer and content syndicate(s) publishers, and consumers, Virtuoso supports standards such as: Atom, RSS 2.0, RSS 1.0, OPML, XBEL, FOAF, SIOC.  Query language support  SQL, SPARQL (with numerous extensions), XQuery (implementation of Core functions library is seriously incomplete), XPath (1.0 only), XSLT (1.0 only) = Schema definition language support = SQL's Data Definition Language, XML Schema  Usage scenarios  Virtuoso is a solution for the following system integration challenges: * Enterprise Information Integration (EII) * Programming Language Independent Web application deployment * Monolithic application decomposition that leverages the principles of service- oriented architecture * Web service based enterprise application integration via a significant amount of WS-* protocols support * Business process management via BPEL * Semantic Web Data Spaces Generation * Deployment platform for injecting RDF-based Linked Data into the Semantic Data Web  Related technology areas  = Data management = * Relational database management system * List of relational database management systems * Comparison of object-relational database management systems * Comparison of relational database management systems = Enterprise application, information, and data integration = * Web 2.0 * Enterprise service bus * Service-oriented architecture * Enterprise application integration * Data integration * Open Semantic Framework * Web service * Semantic Web * Business Integration Severs Comparison Matrix  Related products and tools  In addition to Virtuoso, OpenLink Software produces several related tools and applications: * OpenLink Data Spaces ‚Äì a Virtuoso-based platform for cost- effective creation and management of Semantic Web / Linked Data Web presence. It provides a data junction box for integrating data across third party Social network service, Blog, File sharing, Shared & Social bookmarking, Wiki, E-mail, Photo Sharing, RSS 2.0, Atom, and RSS 1.1 Content Aggregation services. In addition, to its third party integration functionality, it also includes its own rich collection of Linked Data compliant distributed collaborative applications, across each of the aforementioned Web application realms. * Universal Data Access Drivers ‚Äì High-performance data access drivers for ODBC, JDBC, ADO.NET, and OLE DB that provide transparent access to enterprise databases across multiple platforms and databases.

This pterosaur is closely related to Ornithocheirus, but belongs in the family Anhangueridae.Campos, D. de A., and Kellner, A. W. (1985). \\"Um novo exemplar de Anhanguera blittersdorffi (Reptilia, Pterosauria) da forma√ß√£o Santana, Cretaceo Inferior do Nordeste do Brasil.\\" In Congresso Brasileiro de Paleontologia, Rio de Janeiro, Resumos, p. 13.

Description  Life restoration of A. blittersdorffi Anhanguera was a fish-eating animal with a wingspan of about .Aureliano, T., Ghilardi, A. M., Duque, R. R., & Barreto, A. M. (2014). ON THE OCCURRENCE OF PTEROSAURIA IN EXU, PERNAMBUCO (LOWER CRETACEOUS ROMUALDO FORMATION, ARARIPE BASIN), NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL. Estudos Geol√≥gicos, 24(2), 15-27. Available in: Like many other ornithocheirids, Anhanguera had rounded crests at front of its upper and lower jaws, which were filled with angled, conical but curved teeth of various sizes and orientations. Like many of its relatives, the jaws were tapered in width, but expanded into a broad, spoon-shaped rosette at the tip. It is distinguished from its relatives by subtle differences in the crest and teeth: unlike its close relatives Coloborhynchus and Ornithocheirus, the crest on the upper jaw of Anhanguera did not begin at the tip of the snout, but was set farther back on the skull. Like many ornithocheiroids, (most notably the pteranodonts but also in ornithocheirids such as Ludodactylus) Anhanguera had an additional crest protruding from the back of the skull. However, it was reduced to a small, blunt projection in these animals.Kellner, A.W.A. and Tomida, Y. (2000). \\"Description of a new species of Anhangueridae (Pterodactyloidea) with comments on the pterosaurfauna from the Santana Formation (Aptian‚ÄìAlbian), northeastern Brazil.\\" Tokyo, National Science Museum (National Science Museum Monographs, 17). Size of A. blittersdorffi compared to a human A study in 2003 showed that Anhanguera held its head at an angle to the ground due to its inner ear structure, which helped the animal detect its balance.Witmer, L.M., Chatterjee, S., Franzosa, J. and Rowe, T. (2003). \\"Neuroanatomy of flying reptiles and implications for flight, posture and behaviour.\\" Nature, 425(6961): 950-954. Anhanguera had bony rings in their eye sockets, called sclerotic rings. These disks may have provided support to the pterosaur's eyes. Sclerotic rings are found in some extant species of vertebrates. For example, modern day birds have sclerotic rings. The dubious species, A. araripensis, has been described as similar in skull anatomy to other species of Anhanguera, and possibly Coloborhynchus, and the species is placed in either of these genera by various researchers. Like species referred to Coloborhynchus, the snout tip was blunt and bore two forward-projecting teeth that emerged higher on the jaw than the rest of the tooth row. As in most other ornithocheirids, the species bore a large, rounded crest at the tip of the jaws. Like Coloborhynchus species, and unlike the type species of Anhanguera, the crest of A. araripensis emerged from the very tip of the blunted jaws, rather than further back on the jaw. However, unlike Coloborhynchus, A. araripensis lacked a dent or depression in the blunted jaw tip, and the teeth appear to have been smaller and more uniform in size.Veldmeijer, A.J., H.J.M. Meijer, and M. Signore (2006). \\"Coloborhynchus from the Lower Cretaceous Santana Formation, Brazil (Pterosauria, Pterodactyloidea, Anhangueridae); an update.\\" PalArch‚Äôs Journal of Vertebrate Palaeontology, 3(2): 15-29.  Classification  There are two species of Anhanguera: A. blittersdorfi, the type species; and A. piscator. A. blittersdorfi is based on a complete skull from the Romualdo Formation calcareous concretions (Santana Group) of the Cear√° and Pernambuco states of Brazil. The species A. piscator, known from a nearly-complete skeleton, was at one point proposed to belong to the genus Coloborhynchus,Veldmeijer, A. J. (2003).

Also known from a complete skeleton is A. spielbergi, which was also originally considered a species of Coloborhynchus, but it is currently placed as a species of Maaradactylus.Veldmeijer, A.J. (2003). \\"Description of Coloborhynchus spielbergi sp. nov. (Pterodactyloidea) from the Albian (Lower Cretaceous) of Brazil.\\" Scripta Geologica, 125: 35-139.

The abstracts of the congress were subsequently published that year in the magazine Ci√™ncia e Cultura. The generic name honours Llewellyn Ivor Price. The specific name is derived from Greek ŒºŒ≠Œ≥Œ±œÇ, megas, \\"large\\", and ·ΩÄŒ¥œéŒΩ, odon, \\"tooth\\".Martins Neto, R.G. (1986). Pricesaurus megalodon nov. gen. nov. sp. (Pterosauria, Pterodactyloidea), Cretaceo Inferior, Chapada do Araripe (NE-Brasil). Ci√™ncia e Cultura 38(7): 756-757 [Portuguese] The species was based on two syntypes that Martins-Neto considered to have originated from a single individual animal, even though he had separately acquired them from commercial fossil dealers in two nodules: specimen CPCA 3592, a long point of a snout, and specimen CPCA 3591, an long middle part of a skull. Pricesaurus is thus exclusively known from cranial material. Both specimens were probably found in the Romualdo Member of the Araripe Basin and both are part of the collection of the Centro de Pesquisas Paleontol√≥gicas da Chapada do Araripe. Martins-Neto provided a diagnosis of four distinctive traits: the breadth of the premaxillae; the closely positioned teeth; the deep premaxillary tooth sockets; and the rounded front of the fenestra nasoantorbitalis. However, in 1988 Alexander Kellner concluded that Pricesaurus was a nomen vanum, primarily because the specimens almost certainly represented different individuals. According to Kellner, the snout was from a larger animal than the middle part of the skull. In addition, the diagnosis did not contain true autapomorphies.Kellner A.W.A. & Campos D.A., 1988, \\"Sobre um novo pterossauro com crista sagital da Bacia do Araripe, Cret√°ceo Inferior do Nordeste do Brasil\\", Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ci√™ncias, 60: 460-469 In 2012, a publication by Felipe Lima Pinheiro and colleagues presented the first detailed study of the specimens. It was concluded that the fossils indeed came from different individuals, even though their size was not necessarily incompatible. The snout showed that the fifth and sixth tooth pairs are smaller than the fourth and seventh, making the specimen indistinguishable between Anhanguera blittersdorffi and Anhanguera piscator, which show the same tooth pattern. Both specimens were referred to as Anhanguera sp. Pinheiro et al. also stated that Pricesaurus is a nomen nudum because it was named in an abstract.Felipe Lima Pinheiro, Cesar Leandro Schultz, Rafael Gioia Martins- Neto‚Ä† & Jos√© Artur Ferreira Gomes de Andrade, 2012, \\"What is ‚ÄúPricesaurus megalodon‚Äù?

She was the daughter of the sculptor and wife of . She was named Knight of the Legion of Honor in 1973, Officer of Arts and Letters in 1979 and then Commander of Arts and Letters in 1983. She is buried in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. Early life Monfort was born in the neighborhood of Le Marais, on Rue Elz√©vir, a short distance away from Rue de Thorigny, where she would set up her first theatre much later. Her family had lived in this Parisian neighborhood for seven generations. She lost her mother very early and her father put her in a boarding school. She undertook her secondary studies first at lyc√©e Victor Hugo and then at lyc√©e Victor Duruy. She obtained her baccalaur√©at at 14 with special permission. Her father had intended for her career to be spent at the Gobelin manufactory but she preferred the theatre and took classes with Jean Herv√© and Jean Valcourt.Biography on the site of Lyc√©e Silvia Monfort In 1939, aged 16, she met Maurice Clavel, who directed the Resistance network in Eure-et-Loir. Under the pseudonym \\"Sinclair\\" (the name of a hill that looms over S√®te), she participated in the liberation of Nogent-le-Rotrou and of Chartres in 1944. She was one of the notables who welcomed General De Gaulle on the square in front of the Cathedral of Chartres. Once the war ended, she married Maurice Clavel. She was decorated with the Croix de guerre by General De Gaulle and with the Bronze Star by General Patton. on the site of the Th√©√¢tre Silvia- Monfort. Cocteau, Vilar and the TNP In 1945, she attracted notice for her acting in a play by Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, La casa de Bernarda Alba. Her personality drew the attention of Edwige Feuill√®re, whose reader she became in L'Aigle √† deux t√™tes by Jean Cocteau. The play was first presented in 1946 at the Royal Theatre of the Galeries Royales of Saint-Hubert in Brussels, where she met with great success. After performances in Lyon, the play had its Parisian premiere at the Th√©√¢tre H√©bertot, followed by performances at La Fenice in Venice. Through Clavel, she met Jean Vilar in 1947 and participated in the Th√©√¢tre National Populaire. She took part in the first festival d'Avignon, with The Story of Tobias and Sarah (1947). Alongside G√©rard Philipe, she played Chim√®ne in Le Cid, then performed at Chaillot and subsequently on tour across Europe (1954). Next, she played with Vilar in Cinna and in The Marriage of Figaro. Cinema Monfort made her film debut in Les Anges du p√©ch√©'. Director Robert Bresson had hired her without knowing that she was an actress, as he was looking for non-professionals for his film.. In 1948, she played the role of √âdith de Berg in the cinematic adaptation of L'Aigle √† deux t√™tes by Cocteau with Feuill√®re and Jean Marais. In 1955, Agn√®s Varda, then a photographer at the TNP, directed her first film, one of the first belonging to the New Wave. Varda remembers Silvia Monfort in La Pointe Courte: \\"Curious and a pioneer by nature, she threw herself into the project with delight and discipline. I really think she was happy to fight for a cinema of the future.\\"Agn√®s Varda, Varda par Agn√®s - √âditions Cahiers du cin√©ma - 1994, new edition in 2006. Separated from Maurice Clavel, Silvia Monfort shared her life with and participated in the films of director Jean-Paul Le Chanois. Despite her having an arm in a plaster cast, he insisted that she play a Polish prisoner with Fran√ßois P√©rier and Pierre Fresnay in a film inspired by a true story, Les √âvad√©s. She then co-starred with Jean Gabin and Nicole Courcel in Le Cas du docteur Laurent, a film advocating painless childbirth (1957), and then in an obscure film of Le Chanois dealing with parent-child relations, Par-dessus le mur (1961). In two films dealing with social conditions, she was Eponine of Les Mis√©rables, alongside Gabin and Bourvil (1958), and then the Gypsy girl Myrtille in Mandrin, bandit gentilhomme beside Georges Rivi√®re and Georges Wilson. This film concluded her cinematic career and her relationship with Le Chanois in 1962. On the road During the 1960s, Silvia Monfort was passionate about cultural decentralization and so set out on the road with Jean Danet and her Tr√©teaux de France. She took an active part in this experiment, seeing to it that new and contemporary plays were staged alternately with the classical repertoire. On 23 June 1965, Silvia wrote to Pierre Gruneberg: \\"I've convinced Danet to schedule for September a series of performances of the Prostitute and of Suddenly, Last Summer under a big top around Paris (in this way the inconvenient returning directors will be able to come see it there if they need to). Oh, I would have done what I could.\\" She wrote at least once, sometimes several times a day to her companion Pierre Gruneberg. In the collection of this correspondence, Letters to Pierre,Lettres √† Pierre 1965-1991 - R√©unies par Danielle Netter - √âditions du Rocher - 2003. Danielle Netter, assistant director, adds: \\"The Tr√©teaux de France was an extraordinary theatrical tool that gave us the occasion to present Sophocles and other dramatic poets before the tenants of the HLM, and one evening to hear a spectator declare at the end of Electra to Silvia 'It's as beautiful as a Western!', which filled our tragedienne with joy.\\" Tragedienne For nearly half a century, whether with the Tr√©teaux, in festivals, in private theatres and later in her Carr√©s, Monfort explored the ancient and modern theatrical repertoires. She acted in no less than five versions of Ph√®dre in different theatres as well as on television. She interpreted numerous works of Racine and Corneille. She performed Sophocles' Electra in the most incongruous of places, such as the \\"trou des Halles\\" in Paris in 1970. She acted in the plays and theatrical adaptations of Maurice Clavel, such as The Isle of Goats and The Noon Terrace. She was directed by Roger Planchon at Villeurbanne in 1959 in Love's Second Surprise and by Luchino Visconti in Paris in 1961 in 'Tis Pity She's a Whore beside Alain Delon and Romy Schneider. She made appearances in Summer and Smoke (1953) and Suddenly, Last Summer (1965) by Tennessee Williams. She incarnated the Sphinx of Cocteau's The Infernal Machine in festivals as well as on television with Claude Giraud in 1963. She was The Respectful Prostitute of Jean-Paul Sartre (1965) as well as The Duchess of Malfi beside Raf Vallone (1981). At Carr√© Thorigny, she brought about the debut of Bernard Giraudeau in Tom Eyen's Why Doesn't Anna's Dress Want to Come off (1974). She was also seen in The Oresteia (1962) and The Persians of Aeschylus (1984). She portrayed Lucrezia Borgia of Victor Hugo (1975), Marguerite de Bourgogne of The Tower of Nesle by Alexandre Dumas, p√®re (1986), Alarica in The Evil Is Spreading (1963), Maid of Jacques Audiberti (1971), Ethel in The Rosenbergs Should Not Die (1968) by Alain Decaux. She took on Ionesco with Jacques, or the Submission (1971), When We Dead Awaken' by Henrik Ibsen (1976) and then The Lady from the Sea' (1977). To celebrate the centenary of Cocteau's birth, she appeared for the last time on the Vaugirard stage in 'The Two Ways' in 1989. In 1972, Monfort described her favorite roles: \\"G√©rard Philippe, whose Chim√®ne I was, had a habit of replying that his favorite role was his next. For me, the one that I am playing fulfills me. Imagine! What marvelous relations between an actor and his character. They see each other every day, but they also know that it's not forever, so they have to work twice as hard. Certain characters have more of an affinity for us. I have always felt myself closer to adolescents thirsting for the absolute than to women with divided hearts. I prefer Electra to Clytemnestra. I was wildly in love with Alarica from The Evil Is Spreading, √âponine from Les Mis√©rables and recently The Maid by Audiberti. But this doesn't prevent me from knowing beautiful stories about those whom I wouldn't play. Of all the heroines, the one who perhaps excited me most was the queen of the Amazons, Penthesilea. When she thought herself defeated by Achilles, she refused to follow him into his kingdom. She wanted him to be king in her land. So she tore him up with her nails, devoured him with her teeth, and said: All women swear to their lovers: I will eat you as long as I love you ‚Äì well, I did it.\\" Ph√®dre Silvia Monfort figures among the most important performers of Ph√®dre. A study by the CNRS about the great tragediennes who have incarnated this character in the 20th century was published in Pour la Science, the French version of Scientific American.Pour la Science - 1999, nr. 258 This study analyzed the relationship between the pauses and the versified text as well as the fluctuations in delivery and demonstrated that Silvia Monfort made the most important use of them (92% of pauses and 3.8 syllables/minute) in relation to other tragic actresses (Sarah Bernhardt, Marie Bell, Nada Strancar and Natacha Amal); this characteristic of her acting contributed to give Silvia Monfort's interpretation an exceptional quality of psychological depth and emotion. She said of her character in 1973: \\"Ph√®dre burns in each one of us. We have hardly grasped the image in the mirror when she dims, and the imminence of this obliteration sharpens the acuteness of the reflection [‚Ä¶] What matters is that there has been a meeting in mystery even from the first reading. It is like desire, or rather it is present in the look that provokes it, or rather there will never be unison. All the opinions, competent, imperious, singular, that were offered to me on the subject of Ph√®dre, and to which I listened intensely, had no other result with me than to lead me back to my Ph√®dre, despite her long being hazy, with the obviousness of a pawn moving back to the first square on a board game [‚Ä¶] this is the wonder of Ph√®dre: to tackle it is to resign oneself to it.\\"Program of Ph√®dre at the Carr√© Thorigny, 1973. Circus and Mime School In 1972, with the support of Jacques Duhamel, then Minister of Cultural Affairs, she set up and directed the Carr√© Thorigny in the neighborhood of Le Marais in Paris, where she put on multidisciplinary shows. She was especially interested in the circus world and organized an exhibit entitled Circus in color which met with success. Following her contacts with circus people and her meeting with Alexis Gruss, she organized old-style circus performances in the courtyard of the H√¥tel Sal√©, located in front of the Carr√©. The public's fancy led Monfort and Gruss to set up (in 1974) the first circus and mime's school in France, L'√©cole au Carr√©, which they directed together. They wanted to highlight the nobility of the circus's origins and were involved in bringing to life an updated old-style circus. The Gruss circus followed Monfort in her successive moves until it became a national circus in 1982. It was at the Carr√© Thorigny that Alain Decaux awarded Silvia Monfort the Legion of Honor in 1973 while paying homage to \\"her passion for the theatre and the inflexible will with which she serves it.\\" The Carr√© had to leave Rue de Thorigny in 1974 because of a property transaction. Monfort thus transferred her Nouveau Carr√© into the old th√©√¢tre de la Ga√Æt√©-Lyrique which opened on 1 October 1974 and set up the Gruss circus in the square in front of the theatre. Because of the building's awaiting renovation, she set up her stage under a big top in the Jardin d'Acclimatation from 1978 to 1979. She then had to move her big top onto the site of the former abattoirs of Vaugirard. There, she actually set up two big tops, one for theatre and one for the circus. Lacking funds, the project of renovating the Ga√Æt√©-Lyrique was abandoned. She continued working to establish a Nouveau Carr√© at Vaugirard on the site of and in place of the big tops. The decision to build the theatre such as it is today was taken in 1986. On 7 March 1989, she wrote: \\"This will be my theatre. Even so, incredible! I don't know a single living person for whom his own theatre was built, with his name and of the right size.\\" But she died a few months before its completion. Inaugurated in 1992, it bears her name: Th√©√¢tre Silvia-Monfort. She died on 30 March 1991 of lung cancer in Courchevel. The Silvia Monfort Prize Pierre Gruneberg, who became Silvia Monfort's lover in 1963 and married her on 24 May 1990, founded the Silvia Monfort Prize Association in 1996. This prize is issued every two years to a young actress by a professional jury. Since its inception, the prizewinners have been: # Smadi Wolfman (1996) # Rachida Brakni (1998) # Mona Abdel Hadi (2000) # Isabelle Joly (2002) # Marion Bottolier (2004) # Gina Ndjemba (2006) Quotations about her *Jean Cocteau : *Juliette Gr√©co : > Silvia Monfort came back from a solitary walk and held out a flower to her > husband Clavel, saying in her husky voice: 'I've stolen this flower for you > on the mountain...'

I grew up just over the river, Ridgewood, New Jersey, and -- son's here, had dinner with my son last night and was treated to just an exceptional flight in over Lower Manhattan last night.\\" He received his bachelor's degree in economics from Franklin and Marshall College in 1977. Following graduation, he joined Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates in Philadelphia. He went on to earn a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1984. He was an assistant professor of economics at the Krannert School of Management at Purdue University from 1984 to 1989. Career at Federal Reserve Lacker (right) with Richmond Fed Presidents J. Alfred Broaddus (left) and Robert P. Black (center) Lacker joined the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond in 1989 as an economist in the banking area of the Research Department. He was named research officer in 1994, vice president in 1996, and senior vice president and director of the Research Department in May 1999. Lacker took office on August 1, 2004, as the seventh chief executive of the Fifth District Federal Reserve Bank at Richmond. He served the remainder of a term that began on March 1, 2001. He served as a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, bringing his district's perspective to policy discussions in Washington. Lacker's vote was the solitary dissent in the August, September, October, and December 2006 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.FOMC: Transcripts and Other Historical Materials, 2006. Federal Reserve Board of Governors. The FOMC decided to keep interest rates steady at 5.25 percent after a series of seventeen consecutive increases of twenty-five basis points each, while Lacker voted for additional tightening. At the January 2009 meeting, \\"Mr. Lacker dissented because he preferred to expand the monetary base by purchasing U.S. Treasury securities rather than through targeted credit programs\\", according to the FOMC minutes. In addition Lacker voted against the action at April 2012 meeting: \\"... who does not anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate through late 2014\\", according to FOMC press release. He cast the sole vote against quantitative easing by the purchase of mortgage-backed securities and the issuance of forward guidance at the September 2012 FOMC meeting. When the Fed met in September 2015, Lacker issued the only vote in favor of increasing interest rates. His was the first such dissenting vote from the committee all year.http://www.newsadvance.com/work_it_lynchburg/news/the-fed-s-critic-and- defender-jeffrey-lacker-reflects- on/article_206a0bfb-39c3-5312-96ff-f5a0012742f3.html He was termed \\"a maverick\\" in a February 2017 Richmond Times-Dispatch cover story in the RTD Metro Business section. Previously in 2017, the Richmond Times-Dispatch announced that Lacker would retire on October 1, 2017. On April 4, 2017, Lacker abruptly resigned his post, admitting that he spoke to a Medley Global Advisors financial analyst about confidential Fed deliberations in 2012, and also \\"failed to disclose the details of the conversation even when he was questioned directly in an internal investigation.\\"Binyamin Appelbaum, Richmond Fed President Resigns, Admitting He Violated Confidentiality, New York Times (April 4, 2017). The Fed, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and U.S. Attorney's Office all investigated the leak, but no charges were brought against any person. Lacker's attorney said that Lacker had cooperated with the Justice Department and that he was \\"informed that no charges will be brought and that the investigation as to him is complete.\\" On August 14, 2018, the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Business in Richmond, Virginia announced that Lacker had been appointed Distinguished Professor in the Department of Economics. Other activities Lacker is the author of numerous articles in professional journals on monetary, financial, and payment economics, and has presented his work at several universities and central banks. He taught at The College of William and Mary in 1992 and 1993, and in 1997 he was a visiting scholar at the Swiss National Bank. He is the author of From Real Bills to Too Big to Fail: H. Parker Willis and the Fed's First Century. Lacker is a member of the Advisory Board of Side by Side, and is a director of the Council for Economic Education and the World Affairs Council of Greater Richmond.

There it left the river and continued further west to Chinklacamoose (what is now the borough of Clearfield) and finally Kittanning on the Allegheny River. The Great Shamokin Path connected settlements along the Susquehanna River with those on the Allegheny River (and the Ohio River downstream of Kittanning). For several decades in the early 18th century, the villages of Shamokin and Kittanning were two of the most important Native American villages in Pennsylvania. The colonists recorded the path as used by Moravian Bishop Ettwein and his group of some 200 Lenape and Mohican Christians in 1772. They traveled west along the path from their village of Friedensh√ºtten (Cabins of Peace) near modern Wyalusing on the North Branch of the Susquehanna to their new village of Friedensstadt (City of Peace) on the Beaver River in southwestern Pennsylvania. Today a long rail trail in Armstrong County follows a short portion of the Great Shamokin Path, and the former course of the Rural Valley Railroad. Susquehanna to the Allegheny In 1772, John Ettwein and his group of some 200 Christian Lenape and Mohican traveled west along The Great Shamokin Path from their village of Friedensh√ºtten (Cabins of Peace) near modern Wyalusing on the North Branch Susquehanna River to their new village of Friedensstadt (City of Peace) on the Beaver River in southwestern Pennsylvania. The village of Shamokin was just south of the \\"forks of the Susquehanna\\", the confluence of the West Branch Susquehanna River with the Susquehanna River (also known as the North Branch). From there, the Great Shamokin Path headed north and forded the river (where current Northumberland developed), then went along the left (west) bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River to the Shawnee town of Chillisquaque on Chillisquaque Creek. The path continued north through what are now Milton and Watsontown, where the path forked into two branches, both leading to Canaserage on Muncy Creek (today Muncy). At Canaserage the river and path turned west. At least two other paths led northeast: the Wyalusing Path (along Muncy Creek to Wyalusing); and the Towanda Path (to Towanda), both on the North Branch of the Susquehanna River. The Great Shamokin Path led west to the village of Otstonwakin (now Montoursville) on Loyalsock Creek at the confluence with the West Branch of the Susquehanna, and upriver to French Margaret's Town (developed as western Williamsport) on Lycoming Creek. The Sheshequin Path led north along Lycoming Creek to Sheshequin (now Ulster) on the North Branch Susquhehanna River. Further west the path went through the village of Quenashawakee, forded Larrys Creek and Pine Creek and came to the Great Island, (now just east of Lock Haven).The Big Spring\\" in Brady Township, Pennsylvania, was an important junction connecting the Great Shamokin Path and Goschgoschink Path. The Great Island was an important crossroads with paths leading in many directions. The Great Shamokin Path left the river here (which turns north) to continue west along Bald Eagle Creek, fording Beech Creek and following Marsh Creek and Little Marsh Creek to its end. Then it climbed the Allegheny Front to modern-day Snow Shoe and on to Moshannon, where there were two branches possible to Kylertown. The branches differed in their fords of Black Moshannon Creek and Moshannon Creek, both of which were difficult to cross. From Kylertown the path continued west, fording Clearfield Creek before reaching Chinklacamoose (now Clearfield). At Chinklacamoose the Great Shamokin Path rejoined the West Branch Susquehanna River and followed it west seven miles (11 km) to Curwensville, Pennsylvania and Anderson Creek. Several crossings of the Susquehanna were needed to avoid thickets of mountain laurel bushes here. The path followed Anderson Creek Gorge a few miles, left it to go west to what is now Chestnut Grove, and then on to The Big Spring, near Luthersburg, Brady Township, Clearfield County, Pennsylvania. Fort Augusta Fort Augusta was a stronghold in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, in the upper Susquehanna Valley from the time of the French and Indian War to the close of the American Revolution. The fort was erected by Col. William Clapham in 1756 at a site now within the limits of the city of Sunbury, in an area the Indians called \\"Shamokin.\\" It was first constructed as part of the British defense against the raids of the French and Indians from the upper Allegheny region. Later, it served as a rebel American fortress during the American Revolution to aid in protecting settlers of the upper Susquehanna from Britain's Indian allies to the north. Named for Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, the mother of King George III, Fort Augusta was the largest of the Provincial forts. It was dismantled in 1794 after the United States gained independence. During the French and Indian War in 1757‚Äì1758, several hundred French and Indian troops traveled the Great Shamokin Path in an effort to destroy Fort Augusta, the main stronghold of the English at the junction of the East and West branches of the Susquehanna River. This army was gathered from the French posts at Duquesne, Kittanning, Venango and Le Boeuf and assembled at the mouth of Anderson Creek. They constructed crude boats, rafts and bateau for passage down the Susquehanna River for the proposed attack. They dragged along with them two small brass cannon, but after reconnoitering, found the distance too great for the guns to shoot from the hill opposite the fort. The defense at Fort Augusta was strong enough to resist attack by storming or by siege, and the French attack was abandoned. A British defeat at Fort Augusta may have altered the history of the course of the French and Indian War. In the 21st century on the site of the old Fort, the Northumberland County Historical Society has its headquarters in the \\"Hunter House Museum.\\" The museum contains historical and archaeological artifacts dealing with Fort Augusta and items of local history. It maintains a genealogical library of material on early families in Northumberland County and surrounding counties. The museum is located at 1150 North Front Street, Sunbury, Pennsylvania. Fort Augusta's underground powder magazine still exists. File:Ft. Augusta model.pngModel of Ft.

French and Indian troops assembled at the mouth of Anderson Creek before the assault on Fort Augusta. Big Spring Punxsutawney, Jefferson County, PA The Big Spring near Luthersburg, Brady Township, Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, was an important camp site and trail hub. Here, the Goschgoschink Path, later known as Mead's Path, turned northwest to the Venango Path, Lake Erie and Canada. The Great Shamokin Path continued through Troutville and followed tributaries of Mahoning Creek to Punxsutawney. From Punxsutawney, the trail followed Cowanshannock Creek to Smicksburg, Rural Valley, Kittanning and the Allegheny River. During the War of 1812, Major William McCelland departed Fort Loudoun, near Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, on March 4, 1814 and marched a division of troops numbering 221 privates, three captains. five lieutenants and two ensigns along Anderson Creek to meet the Goschgoschink Path at the Big Spring. McClelland's division relieved American forces at Lake Erie and later fought well at the Battle of Chippewa and Battle of Lundy's Lane. Amish country along the Great Shamokin Path Amish buggy An Amish heritage corridor extends generally along the Great Shamokin Path through Clearfield, Jefferson, Indiana and Armstrong counties, beginning at Big Spring near Luthersburg, Clearfield County, and ending in Rural Valley in Armstrong County. The corridor winds through Amish settlements near the villages of Troutville in Clearfield County; Big Run, Cloe and Punxsutawney in Jefferson County; Smicksburg in Indiana County; and Rural Valley in Armstrong County. Amish buggies co-mingle with automobiles through the corridor. The Troutville Amish settlement in Brady Township, Clearfield County, is good-sized and has eight congregations. The settlement has farms, trades and small shops. Troutville was named for Jacob Trautwien who settled the area in 1832. The Smicksburg Amish settlement is centered on the borough of Smicksburg, Indiana County, about 10 miles southwest of Punxsutawney. The Smicksburg settlement is the third-largest Amish settlement in Pennsylvania, and the eleventh largest in the U.S. The Smicksburg settlement has 18 church districts and was founded in 1962. Amish here drive Midwestern-style black buggies. Smicksburg was founded in 1827 by the Reverend J. George Schmick, and most of the citizens are Amish. The population was 46 at the 2010 census, and is one of the smallest incorporated boroughs in Pennsylvania. The Smicksburg settlement has specialty shops with Amish wares of handcrafts, quilts, furniture, foods and eating establishments. Rural Valley is a borough in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania, where the Cowanshannock Creek flows west leading to the Allegheny River. The population was 876 at the 2010 census. The regional high school, West Shamokin High School, bears the name of the historic Great Shamokin Path.

An NK Zagreb youth product, he spent most of his career in Germany. At international level, he earned two caps with the Croatia national team. Club career =NK Zagreb= Born in Zagreb, Banoviƒá began to play football at NK Zagreb when he was 6 years old and subsequently spent his entire youth career with the club, eventually being added to their first team in the summer of 1997. He went on to play in the Croatian First League with the club during the following three seasons. After making 11 domestic league appearances in his first season as a professional, he went on to find his place as a regular with NK Zagreb. During the following two seasons, he made a total of 52 domestic league appearances and scored a total of nine domestic league goals for the club, eight of which came during the 1999‚Äì2000 season. =Werder Bremen= In the summer of 2000, Banoviƒá left NK Zagreb for a record outgoing transfer fee of DM 3.7 million (about ‚Ç¨1.9 million) for German Bundesliga side Werder Bremen. Banoviƒá made his Bundesliga debut in Werder Bremen's 3‚Äì3 draw at home to Bayer Leverkusen on 14 October 2000, coming on as a substitute for Dieter Eilts in the 58th minute. He went on to make a total of 17 Bundesliga appearances in his first season with Bremen, without scoring any goals. He eventually scored his first Bundesliga goal in his third league appearance of the 2001‚Äì02 season, netting the opening goal in Bremen's 2‚Äì1 defeat at 1. FC Kaiserslautern on 9 September 2001. It was his only goal of the season, which he once again finished with a total of 17 Bundesliga appearances on his tally. He went on to make another 15 Bundesliga appearances during the following season in 2002‚Äì03, scoring his second Bundesliga goal for Bremen in their 2‚Äì0 win at home to VfL Bochum on 8 March 2003. However, he lost his place in the first team during the 2003‚Äì04 season, only appearing in three Bundesliga matches that season. He did, however, score one more goal for the club's first team, netting their seventh goal in a 9‚Äì1 win at Ludwigsfelder FC in the first round of the German Cup. Although the club won the league that season, his contribution to the achievement was minimal, as all of his three Bundesliga appearances of the season came in the first five matches. His final appearance for Bremen's first team came in the German Cup in December 2003. Eventually finding himself relegated to the club's reserve squad, Banoviƒá appeared in five Regionalliga Nord matches during the spring of 2004. He scored five goals during his five appearances for the reserves, a hat-trick in a 3‚Äì3 draw against SC Paderborn 07 and a brace in a 4‚Äì2 win against SG Wattenscheid 09. =1. FC N√ºrnberg= In the summer of 2004, Banoviƒá left Bremen for Bundesliga rivals 1. FC N√ºrnberg. He scored two goals in his first two Bundesliga matches for Nuremberg, converting a penalty to score the opening goal in their 3‚Äì1 win at 1. FC Kaiserslautern and netting the equaliser in a 1‚Äì1 draw at home to VfB Stuttgart. He scored another goal in N√ºrnberg's 2‚Äì2 draw at home to Bayern Munich in December 2004, converting a penalty to set the final score. He made a total of 22 Bundesliga appearances for N√ºrnberg in his first season with the club. He went on to make another 23 league appearances during the following season in 2005‚Äì2006, scoring two more goals. His first goal of the season came in a 3‚Äì2 defeat at home to Arminia Bielefeld in October 2005 and his second from a long-range free kick in a 3‚Äì1 win at Kaiserslautern the following month. During the same season, he also scored two goals in the first two of the club's three matches in the German Cup, before they were knocked out in the round of 16. He made a good start to the 2006‚Äì07 Bundesliga season with N√ºrnberg, assisting in all three goals for a 3‚Äì0 win at VfB Stuttgart in the club's opening match of the season. He started all of the club's opening three matches of the Bundesliga season, but later lost his place in the starting line-up. He did, however, continue to play regularly as a substitute until the end of the season. His final season with N√ºrnberg was statistically nevertheless his most successful in the Bundesliga, with a tally of five goals in 25 appearances. He also helped N√ºrnberg win the 2006‚Äì07 German Cup, making four appearances and scoring the only goal of their away match at BV Cloppenburg in the first round. His final appearance for N√ºrnberg came on 26 May 2007 in the German Cup final against VfB Stuttgart, in which he came off the bench for the final six minutes of extra time. =SC Freiburg= The day after the end of the 2006‚Äì07 Bundesliga season, it was confirmed that Banoviƒá will move to 2. Bundesliga side SC Freiburg on a free transfer following the expiration of his contract with Nuremberg at the end of June 2007. He signed a two-year contract with the club. Banoviƒá quickly established himself as a regular at Freiburg, making his competitive debut against FC Villingen in the first round of the German Cup. He made his league debut against VfL Osnabr√ºck in the club's first league match of the season and subsequently only missed one league match during the entire season due to a yellow-card suspension. In only his second appearance in the 2. Bundesliga, he scored his first and only league goal of the season in Freiburg's 1‚Äì0 win over SC Paderborn 07. The following season in 2008‚Äì09, he made a total of 22 appearances in the 2nd Bundesliga and helped the club finish top of the league, securing promotion to the Bundesliga after four years of playing in the second division. He also scored two league goals for the club during the season, both in April 2009. The first of the two goals came in Freiburg's 2‚Äì1 win at 1. FSV Mainz 05 on 13 April 2009 and the second in their 3‚Äì2 win at home to FC Ingolstadt 04 a week later. At the end of the season, he extended his contract with Freiburg for another year. Banoviƒá started the 2009‚Äì10 Bundesliga season as a regular with Freiburg and scored his first goals of the season on 20 September 2009, netting a brace in Freiburg's 4‚Äì0 win at Hertha BSC. Two weeks later, he also scored one goal in Freiburg's 5‚Äì2 defeat at Hannover 96. =MSV Duisburg= By January 2011, Banoviƒá had lost his place in Freiburg's starting formation and was loaned to MSV Duisburg for the rest of the 2010‚Äì11 season. He appeared in all but one of the club's matches and scored once. At the end of the season, he returned to Freiburg. =Energie Cottbus= After preparing for the 2011‚Äì12 season with SC Freiburg, but before the season began he transferred back to the 2nd division, joining Energie Cottbus. =Hallescher FC= Banoviƒá left Cottbus at the end of the 2013‚Äì14 after the club were relegated from the 2. Bundesliga. He signed for Hallescher FC International career Between 1996 and 2001, Banoviƒá won a total of 25 international caps for the Croatian national under-17, under-19 and under-21 teams, scoring a total of three international goals. His first appearance in the finals of an international youth tournament came at the 1998 European Under-18 Championship in Cyprus, where the team reached the third place after beating Portugal in penalty shootout. In the spring of 1999, Banoviƒá was part of the Croatian squad at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship in Nigeria, where he appeared as a second- half substitute in all of the team's four matches before they were eliminated by Brazil in the round of 16, also scoring one goal in Croatia's 5‚Äì1 victory over Kazakhstan in their second group match. He also played for the Croatian national under-21 team at the final tournament of the UEFA U-21 Championship 2000 in Slovakia. Banoviƒá won his first senior international cap for Croatia as a substitute in their friendly match against Israel on 18 August 2004 in Vara≈ædin, which they won 1‚Äì0. In October of the same year, he made his only appearance in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying, playing as a substitute in the final 14 minutes of Croatia's third qualifying match, in which they were held to a 2‚Äì2 draw by Bulgaria in Zagreb. After that, he was no longer part of the national team. Honours =Club= 1\\\\.

With a length around 3 m (10 ft), some species were twice as large as modern extant species. Sthenurus was related to the better-known Procoptodon. The subfamily Sthenurinae is believed to have separated from its sister taxon, the Macropodinae (kangaroos and wallabies), halfway through the Miocene, and then its population grew during the Pliocene. Fossil habitats Research by Darren R. Gr√∂cke from Monash University analysed the diets of fauna at various fossil site localities in South Australia, using stable carbon isotope analysis 13C/12C of collagen. He found that at older localities such as Cooper Creek, the species of Sthenurus were adapted to a diet of leaves and twigs (browsing) due to the wet climate of the time between 132 and 108 thousand years ago (kya - by thermoluminescence dating and uranium dating), which allowed for a more varied vegetation cover. At the Baldina Creek fossil site 30 kya (C14 dating), the genus had transitioned to a diet of grass-grazing. During this time, the area was open grasslands with sparse tree cover as the continent was drier than today, but at Dempsey's Lake (36-25 kya) and Rockey River (19 kya C14 dating), their diet was of both grazing and browsing. This analysis may be because of a wetter climatic period. The overall anatomy of the genus did not alter in response to the change in diet and dentition did not adapt to the varying toughness of the vegetation between grasses, shrubs, and trees.Darren R.

Examination of skeletal remains of Sthenurus from Lake Callabonna, northern South Australia, revealed that as the animals were trapped as they floundered in the clay mud while attempting to cross the floor of the lake during tow-water or dry times. The data show that three closely allied sthenurine species coexisted sympatrically at Lake Callabonna: a new giant taxon, S. stirlingi, an intermediate-sized S. tindalei, and the considerably smaller S. andersoni. Comparative osteology of these Sthenurus species with Macropus giganteus emphasizes how different sthenurine kangaroos were from extant kangaroos, especially with the sthenurines' short, deep skulls, long front feet with very reduced lateral digits, and the monodactyl hind feet.WELLS, RT; TEDFORD, RH BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY Issue: 225 Pages: 1-111 Published: 1995 Teapot Creek, a tributary of the MacLaughlin River in the Southern Monaro, southeastern New South Wales, contains a sequence of terraces. The highest and oldest of these terraces was reported to contain the remains of fossil mammals found in Plio-Pleistocene fossil deposits elsewhere in eastern Australia. Sthenurus atlas, S. occidentalis, and S. newtonae are some of the species identified from the fossils found in the terrace.Armand, L (Armand, L); Ride, WDL (Ride, WDL); Taylor, G (Taylor, G) PROCEEDINGS OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY OF NEW SOUTH WALES Volume: 122 Pages: 101-121 Published: DEC 22 2000 Paleodiet Lower jaw of Sthenurus sp. Examining the structure and lifestyle of this species is difficult because not much material has surfaced in regards to them. However, even within the rarity of discoveries relating to the kangaroo-like species, scientists were able to use their findings to learn more about their lifestyles. For example, scientists broke down the few bones that they had discovered during the process of isotope analysis (which is the study of the distribution of certain isotopes that ease the process of drawing conclusions when determining food chains) and retrieved material which allowed them to draw the conclusion regarding their paleodiet. These animals were herbivores because the material they retrieved drew back to the plantation that was Australia (where their bones were found).By: Grocke, DR AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY Volume: 45 Issue: 3 Pages: 607-617 Published: 1997 Anatomy Life restoration S. stirlingi in walking pose In anatomy, they had a tail shorter but stronger than present species of kangaroos, and only one toe instead of three like the red kangaroo. At the end of the foot was a small hoof-like nail suited for flat terrain; this toe is considered their fourth toe. Their skeletal structure was very robust with powerful hind limbs, a broad pelvis, a short neck, and longer arms and phalanges than modern species. Their phalanges may have been used to hold stems and twigs. These unique adaptations suited their feeding habits of browsing in the case of S. occidentalis, but other species were most likely grazers. The body mass of the largest species is estimated to be , nearly three times that of the largest extant species. Due to their giant height and weight, the largest species possibly did not hop as a form of locomotion, but rather walked bipedally in a similar manner to hominids. This gait would have been used at slow speeds, since hopping at slow speeds would have been inefficient. Pentapedal movement and bipedal hopping no longer seem to have been options for these massive kangaroos. A morphological difference exists between the scapulae (shoulder blades) of the Sthenurine and the extant and extinct macropodids.Karen E. Sears, Division of Developmental Biology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Aurora, Colorado 80045 They possessed a short, deep skull, which was suited for stereoscopic vision; this allowed for better depth perception. Skull Palatal view of a Sthenurus sp. skull. S. stirlingi had a large, dolichocephalic skull with a more elevated braincase position and an inflamed nasal frontal region in comparison to the contemporaneous skull of S. tindelai. S. andersoni skull fossils show a dome-like forehead that is unique to it among other otherdolichocephalic sthenurines. This is attributed to the continuous high vaulting of the frontals above the orbits and the line of the rostrum. Teeth These structures were tough and strongly enamelled, useful for tough vegetation and with a striation pattern. In S. stirlingi, fossil evidence shows that the tooth row curves medially (anteriorly and posteriorly) from a line tangential to the labial side of the molars at the anterior ridge of the masseteric processes. The fossils of teeth may also suggest that the sthenurines and macropodines shared a common ancestor. They share many synapomorphic character states. They each have well developed lophs on molars and both lack a posthypocristid. Human interaction From evidence gathered at Cuddie Springs, Native Australians inhabited the same habitat as that of Sthenurus and various other extant and extinct species of animals. At this locality, a lack of any specific tools suitable for hunting seems to occur. Instead, tools used to cut meat off the bone and blood residue left on the stone tools were found. Any material made of wood for hunting, such as the boomerang and spear, has either not survived intact or was not used by the people of the time in this locality. While this evidence may suggest that human contact with Sthenurus spp. and all Australian megafauna could have caused the extinction of these mammals, some studies show the extinction was probably under way before human contact. Sthenurus spp. were herbivores, and when a great climate change began to occur, they did not change their eating habits. This probably had a much larger impact on this particular genus regarding extinction. References *Gavin Prideaux, \\"Systematics and Evolution of the Sthenurine Kangaroos\\" (April 1, 2004).

It is one of several pointing breeds and is mainly used in red-legged partridge hunting.  History  The Portuguese Pointer (perdigueiro Portugu√™s) arose from Iberian hunting dogs with its presence in Portugal traceable to the early twelfth century. Initially the dog was bred in royal kennels and later became a very popular hunting dog for the lower classes of society. In the eighteenth century, many English families established a presence in the region of Oporto in the business of wine production and came to know the Portuguese hunting breed which was taken to England where they played a part in the origin of the English pointer. However, during the nineteenth century when Portugal was experiencing considerable social hardships, the breed began a progressive decline. It was not until the 1920s when some breeders made an effort to salvage the breed by locating some of the ancient Portuguese dogs in the inaccessible north of Portugal. The Portuguese pedigree book was then established in 1932 and breed standard in 1938. For at least a thousand years, this dog has always had the same square head, a marked stop, triangular ears and compact look and since the 17th century, the same docked tail, and among pointing dogs all over the world just the perdigueiro and his \\"son\\" the English pointer have this kind of skull-facial convergence so typical. Description A female Portuguese Pointer = Size & Build = The Portuguese Pointer is a dog of medium proportions. The height at the withers is . The weight is for males, and for females. When being evaluated at a conformation show, dogs judged for conformation that benefits working ability, with deviations from the standard penalised according to the amount that they interfere with working ability. The dogs are square in build, with the 10:10¬Ω height to length ratio. The tail is docked to half, or two-thirds the natural length, and held level with the spine when the dog is excited, hanging down otherwise. =Coat & Color= The coat is short and coarse on most of the dog, being the texture of velvet on the ears and face. The Portuguese Pointer does not have an undercoat. Standard colors recognized by the FCI include light yellow, red yellow, and yellow, both unicolored or with white markings. = Health & Lifespan = The Portuguese Pointer has an average life expectancy of 14 years. They are considered a hardy breed with no known health issues specific to them. However, hip dysplasia, patellar lunation, cancer, and autoimmune diseases are potential health concerns for dogs of this size.  Temperament  Portuguese Pointers are an energetic and affectionate breed. As a hunting dog, the breed are enthusiastic and dedicated. They work in close contact with their handlers and are known to be devoted companions, sometimes to the point of being \\"inappropriate and inconvenient\\" in their affections. While very sociable and dedicated to their owner, they can be aloof towards other dogs.

Adherents' claims Supporters claim that the townspeople pay the state $10 million per year in property taxes and $10 million a year in sales taxes (as well as income and other taxes), but receive only $1 million a year to help fund their school system. In the words of Town Selectman Butch Findeisen, \\"There is a point where sharing turns to looting.\\" An economic study commissioned by the town determined Killington would save a minimum of $7 million per year, excluding individual state income tax savings. The town states that it has suffered long term economic problems with restrained development under the state's Act 250 environmental law. This statute controlled growth by establishing environmental review boards, where those affected by the planned development can challenge a proposed development plan. Supporters claim the expense of dealing with this has led Killington Ski Resort to have the highest lift ticket prices in the country. Supporters further claim that the state of Vermont has steadfastly refused to redress the grievances of the town and its people, and that their own state legislator, who represents Killington and Mendon, Vermont, refuses to stand up for the town's interests. On March 2, 2004 200‚Äì300 residents voted, by voice vote, for the secession proposal, passing it by a wide margin. On March 1, 2005, the measure was passed again, this time by ballot, with nearly voting in favor. Arguments in opposition to secession Others dispute many of the town's claims: :The town manager would love to tell you how many millions of dollars Killington sent to the state. Well many of those millions of dollars are sales and rooms and meals taxes. Those weren‚Äôt sent from Killington to the state. They were sent from tourists and others that were in Killington and were required to pay taxes levied by the state of Vermont. ‚ÄîRep. Mark Young (R-Orwell) New Hampshire lacks a general sales tax, but it does have a rooms and meals tax. The Granite State also has what amounts to a statewide property tax, like Vermont's. Like all other states, both Vermont and New Hampshire levy high taxes on gasoline and tobacco. Like Vermont (but unlike some other states), New Hampshire does not guarantee that a given municipality will get any minimum percentage of tax revenues back as state aid. State aid in both states is allocated according to population and other factors not directly related to tax revenues. =Support of education= School funding has long been a matter of contention in Vermont, primarily centering on the substantial disparity in ability to fund schools through property taxes, between towns with large grand lists and those with small ones. In 1997, the Vermont Supreme Court, in the case of Brigham v. State, decided that the disparity was such as to unconstitutionally deprive children in poorer towns of equal opportunity to an education. The court left it to the legislature to come up with a remedy. The legislature responded by passing a highly controversial law known as Act 60. This law provided for a statewide school property tax, per-pupil block grants, and sharing of tax revenue from property wealthy towns to property poor towns. Act 60 was revised in 2003 by Act 68, but retains the statewide property tax. It is as a result of these pieces of legislation that Killington pays more property tax to the state than it receives in the form of block grants. The extent to which a town such as Killington may receive benefits in addition to the block grant, such as possibly lower social welfare costs and higher worker productivity as a result of a better educated population in the state, as well as from general state services (such as highway maintenance, tourism promotion, etc.), is less easily quantified. Disposition of the secession request The legal decision will be made by the states of Vermont and New Hampshire and the United States Congress. Article IV of the U.S. Constitution requires that when the boundaries of existing states are altered, the action needs the consent of the legislatures of all states involved, as well as of Congress. The New Hampshire state legislature passed a law in 2005 authorizing a commission which would negotiate with the State of Vermont, if Vermont ever chooses to establish a corresponding commission. The Vermont legislature is generally expected to reject the idea of ceding Killington to New Hampshire. Even if Vermont votes in favor of Killington's secession, the New Hampshire bill does not obligate the Granite State to accept Killington: the bill merely authorizes the beginnings of negotiations. If no deal can be reached, Killington would remain part of Vermont. Supporters have threatened a federal court battle, but the legal grounds for such a lawsuit remain unclear, since the US Constitution explicitly prohibits Killington's unilateral secession from Vermont (where?). In 2005, Vermont state Reps. Mark Young (R-Orwell), Richard Marron (R-Stowe) and Kathleen Keenan (D-St. Albans City) introduced House Bill 426 that would have required Killington to pay \\"exit fees\\" to reimburse the state for \\"stranded assets of the state, including those relating to education, transportation, and public service\\". The legislation would also have stripped Killington residents of all benefits of Vermont resident status, including instate tuition and tuition assistance. The bill was not acted upon by the House, and effectively died with the adjournment of the 2005‚Äì2006 Legislative session on June 1, 2006.

He was a New York State Legislator who represented Bronx's 7th district from 1919 until his expulsion from the assembly in 1920 during the First Red Scare. Biography DeWitt was born on November 1, 1891 in New York City. He worked as a machinery dealer and was an active Socialist throughout his life. DeWitt first applied for membership in the Socialist Party on August 29, 1913.Proceedings of the Judiciary Committee of the Assembly in the Matter of the Investigation by the Assembly of the State of New York as to the Qualifications of Louis Waldman, August Claessens, Samuel A. DeWitt, Samuel Orr and Charles Solomon, to Retain Their Seats in Said Body, vol. 1. Albany, NY: J.B. Lyon Co., 1920. Vol. 1, pg. 159. =Political career= Sam Dewitt is most famous for being expelled in 1920 from the New York State Assembly along with four fellow assemblymen for being members of the Socialist Party. The five Socialists were barred from taking their seats at the beginning of the session of the 143rd New York State Legislature and, after a protracted \\"trial\\" before the Assembly Committee on the Judiciary, defended by Morris Hillquit and Seymour Stedman, were expelled on April 1. All five were re-elected at a special election on September 16, and appeared to take their seats at the beginning of the special session on September 20. The next day, DeWitt and Samuel Orr were permitted to take their seats, but August Claessens, Charles Solomon and Louis Waldman were expelled again. Protesting against the re-expulsion of their comrades, DeWitt and Orr resigned their seats. Afterwards DeWitt was a frequent candidate for political office, without success. He ran in the Bronx 7th District in 1924 and 1926, for Bronx borough president in 1925, for the Bronx 3rd District in 1927 and 1929, and the Queens 4th District in 1932. DeWitt made several unsuccessful campaigns for United States Congress, running in the 22nd District of New York in 1928, the 2nd District of New York in 1934 and once again in 1935.Political Graveyard.com, retrieved Aug. 24, 2009. During the bitter faction fights of the 1930s in the Socialist Party, DeWitt authored a weekly piece for The Socialist Call, a newspaper published each Saturday in New York City in opposition to the journal of the Old Guard faction, The New Leader. DeWitt authored a regular column called \\"Turn to the Left,\\" in which he expounded upon his political beliefs. While not accepting the Old Guard's extreme gradualist approach, neither was DeWitt a communist. With regard to the Communist Party's efforts to establish a united front in 1935, DeWitt wrote: > \\"I can only deplore [the Communists'] capacity for hatred. I can only > distrust their sincerity when they call me to a 'united front.' I can only > say to them: 'Lenin was a great teacher and undoubtedly a great leader. But > he was a human. > \\"It is quite possible that he erred when he instructed you to treat > Socialists who believed in achieving revolution through democracy in other > lands, as enemies of the workers. It is also quite possible that he was > wrong in his decision that all means, mostly foul, must be used against the > enemies of the masses. ... It is also possible that Socialists have a right > to question whether Lenin or you or any of your committees are God.'\\"S.A. > DeWitt, \\"Turn to the Left,\\" The Socialist Call, vol. 1, no. 11 (June 1, > 1935), pg. 7. The battle between the Old Guard headed by Louis Waldman against a bloc of the Militant faction of Jack Altman with the \\"Progressive\\" group headed by Norman Thomas came to a head in the last days of 1935. DeWitt sided decisively with the latter grouping, breaking ranks with his long-time comrades of the Old Guard. DeWitt stood as a candidate for the New York State Committee of the SPA as part of the Progressive/Militant slate in the April 2, 1936, New York primaries and he won election in Queens County Assembly District 4.\\"New York Primary Results,\\" The Socialist Call, vol. 2, whole no. 57 (April 18, 1936), pg. 6. The Progressive/Militant bloc won a comfortable majority of seats on the State Committee in this election. In a last-gasp effort to retain power, New York Socialist Party State Chairman Waldman called a snap reorganizational meeting on 3 days' notice after the certification of the primary results, to be held in the distant city of Buffalo, as was his prerogative under that state constitution. The Old Guard was defeated in this effort to outmaneuver their opposition with timing and geography, however, and Harry W. Laidler defeated Waldman in his bid for re-election at the April reorganizational meeting by a vote of 60-42.\\"Old Guard Suffers Defeat in NY State Committee,\\" The Socialist Call, vol. 2, whole no. 58 (April 25, 1936), pg. 2. DeWitt was elected State Treasurer of the Socialist Party of New York at this session. =Literary endeavors= DeWitt was a long-time friend of left wing writer Upton Sinclair. In Sinclair's famous muckraking novel The Jungle, published in 1906, one of the main characters, Nicolas Schliemann, is said to be based on Sam DeWitt. Throughout his life, DeWitt was a poet and a playwright, publishing books in both genres. =Later years, death and legacy= In late 1919, Sam DeWitt founded the DeWitt Tool Company, located in the machine tool district of New York City. The firm bought and sold used machinery and equipment, and included among its services the liquidation of defunct industrial plants. Early on the company had for its slogan \\"The House of a Thousand Bargains.\\"Letterhead, Samuel A. DeWitt in New York to Art Young in Bethel, CT, November 15, 1934.

It is a wholesaler of metal cutting tools, and is the home of Drill America. DeWitt died on January 22, 1963 in Yonkers, New York. He was survived by his wife Augusta, who died in 1985.

John had studied at the University of Oxford and the University of Paris before beginning his ecclesiastical career at St. Andrews, entering the service of Bishop Richard. The latter made him Archdeacon of the see. His nickname would usually be taken to indicate that he was either a Gaelic-speaker or from Scotland-north-of-the-Forth (Scotia), but according to John of Fordun, he was from the villa of Podoth in Cheshire.John Dowden, The Bishops of Scotland, ed. J. Maitland Thomson, (Glasgow, 1912), p. 8. He certainly had Scottish connections in his family. For instance, he was the nephew of both Robert of Scone, a previous bishop of Cell R√≠gmonaid, and Matthew, Bishop of Aberdeen.D.D.R. Owen, The Reign of William the Lion: Kingship and Culture, 1143-1214, (East Linton, 1997), p. 62. After the death of his patron Richard, he was elected by the cathedral chapter in either 1177 or 1178 in the presence of Cardinal Vibiano of Santo Stefano al Monte Celio, the Papal legate. His election, however, was not approved of by the king, William I of Scotland, who wanted his chaplain Hugh to succeed to the bishopric. John travelled to appeal to Pope Alexander III, who quashed the case of Hugh and sent to Scotland a man named Alexius as legate. Alexius obtained entrance to William's kingdom, and consecrated John at Holyrood Abbey in the presence of four other Scottish bishops, in the year 1180. Nevertheless, the struggle continued, and in 1183, both John and Hugh resigned their rights.John Dowden, op. cit., pp. 8-10. John demanded another Scottish bishopric in compensation,D.D.R. Owen, op. cit., pp. 62-3 as well as continued use of the revenues he had previous had access to. John was subsequently elected by the clergy of Dunkeld as bishop. The new Pope, Pope Lucius III, granted the see of St Andrew to Hugh, and John, having previously been elected to the Bishopric of Dunkeld, had this see confirmed. It did not, however, end the struggle, as King William still objected, and in 1186 both John and Hugh were summoned to Rome once more. Hugh refused to go, and was suspended and excommunicated by the Pope.ibid. 73; John Dowden, op. cit., p. 10. In February 1188 John returned with a Letter of Confirmation of his position from Pope Clement III,Anderson, Alan O., Scottish Annals from English Chroniclers AD500 to 1286, London, 1908: 296-298 and King William finally conceded that John could hold the see \\"of Dunkeld and the revenues which he had before his consecration\\", on the condition that John should quit- claim forever the episcopate of St. Andrews.Anderson, Alan O., Scottish Annals from English Chroniclers AD500 to 1286, London, 1908: 298 John subsequently reorganized the see of Dunkeld. His most notable act was dividing the see into two parts, and his actions thereby led to the creation of the Bishoric of Argyll.John Dowden, op. cit., p. 51. John died in 1203 at Newbattle.

They appeared in numerous films including Check and Double Check (1930), the Vitaphone short Barbershop Blues (1933), When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again (1942), It Ain't Hay (1943), Rhythm of the Islands (1943), Carolina Blues (1944), Greenwich Village (1944), That's My Gal (1947), Here Come the Girls (1953), and The Patsy (1964). In 1950, they appeared on Milton Berle's Texaco Theater over the objections of the show's sponsor. Berle wrote in his autobiography: During the 1950s and 1960s, the \\"Brothers\\" appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, the ABC variety program The Guy Mitchell Show, on Bob Hope specials, and in telecasts featuring Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, Perry Como and Steve Allen. The Four Step Brothers became one of the longest-lasting dance groups, surviving for more than four decades into the 1960s. The Dance Masters of America awarded the group a lifetime achievement award in 1960, and again in 1985 for helping to break the color barrier. In 1988, they received their own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Members Other members of the group during its long tenure included Sylvester \\"Happy\\" Johnson; Prince Spencer, who joined the group in 1941 replacing Johnson; Freddie James, who performed with the group from 1939 to 1943; Rufus \\"Flash\\" McDonald, who joined the act in 1943 when James left; Ernie \\"Sunshine Sammy\\" Morrison; and Norman Rowe. When Prince Spencer left the group to go into the Chicago grocery business, he was replaced by Edward Bozeman. Before his Step Brother days, Bozeman also danced professionally under the name of ‚ÄúPrince.‚Äù The name was not the only coincidence. Like Spencer, Bozeman did the acrobatics and flips part of the routine and always danced last, in the same spot that Spencer had held. Step Brother Flash McDonald said at the time, ‚ÄúLet him be himself, instead of doing Prince‚Äôs (Spencer‚Äôs) routines.‚Äù They all agreed. ‚ÄúThey thought I was a kid, but I was 35,‚Äù Bozeman recalled. Although there is very rare footage of Edward Bozeman performing with the Four Step Brothers, he performed with them from 1964 up to the disbandment of the group in 1989-1990. Subsequent to the addition of Bozeman, there was one other dancer who, essentially, may be considered the \\"final\\" addition to the famous dance quartet's immediate family. In 1968, a ten year-old, acrobatic ball of energy, named Terry Criner was brought on at the end of the quartet's already superior performance. The four simultaneously pointed towards stage right and Little Terry dashed onto the stage ‚Äì with a series of acrobatic moves. His routine was very similar to Bozeman's, however; the kid added head spins, somersaults, no-hand head flip ‚Äì all done with lightning speed. Several newspapers described him as a blur. Criner, who courageously followed Bozeman, was up to the task and was acknowledged by the group's charter members as a \\"great addition.\\" Terry Criner was a fourth-grade elementary student when he was picked to share the stage with some of the greatest dancers in tap history. Although a novice in the art of tap dancing, his acrobatic-dance skills combined landed him into a unique place in history. Criner was the prot√©g√© of Maceo E. Anderson, one of the original members. Criner simultaneously toured with the Step Brothers and opened as a solo act for Donald O'Connor for nearly three years. Third Generation Steps and beyond Criner eventually agreed with Maceo Anderson's idea of starting a new group. Initially called Four Steps and a Miss, the troupe became the Third Generation Steps. The group went on to successes of its own. In 1979, after eleven years of a rather successful show business stent, the 21-year-old Criner shocked Maceo Anderson and group members Cindy Notz and Ivery Wheeler by announcing his retirement‚Äîat the peak of the group's success. In 1980, Criner entered into the gospel ministry. He later added United States Marine, New Teacher of the Year at the Intermediate Level and School Administrator to his career experiences. In 1992, Criner ordained Maceo Anderson as an elder in the church. Elder Anderson resided with the Criner family in Las Vegas, Nevada, for seven years, until he moved to Los Angeles, California. Criner eulogized Maceo Anderson at his \\"Home-going\\" celebration. His favorite song was \\"When the Saints Go Marching In.\\" And, Anderson's all- time favorite saying was, \\"Watch your step, brother!\\" Dr. Terry Criner continues in ministry today as Bishop of Holy Tabernacle Outreach Mission, Inc.

He was educated at Princeton University and began his career as an architectural designer and watercolorist for Robert A.M. Stern Architects in Manhattan. Andrew Zega and Bernd H. Dams both create watercolors of historic American and European buildings and garden ornament. Their work is noted for its realist technique and historical accuracy. The artists, both trained architects, employ the conventions of architectural rendering to re-create destroyed and altered monuments in their initial state, as well as to present unbuilt projects with exceptional realism. The chief value of their work is the enlarged and precise view it thus offers of European‚Äîand particularly French‚Äîarchitectural history. Their expertise is Ancien R√©gime French architecture‚Äîthat of the 17th and 18th centuries‚Äîand particularly French royal ch√¢teaux and gardens, most notably the Ch√¢teau de Versailles and the Ch√¢teau de Marly, the monumental estates of King Louis XIV. In various publications, they have re-examined the genesis of both ch√¢teaux, and have renounced the traditional authorship of Versailles to Louis Le Vau in favor of a triumvirate of Le Vau, Charles Le Brun and Claude Perrault; and have attributed Marly's creation to Le Brun, renouncing the traditional attribution to Jules Hardouin-Mansart. Their watercolors are held in many private and public collections, including those of: The New-York Historical Society, The Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, The Museum of the √éle-de- France, Princeton University, Jayne Wrightsman, Brooke Astor, Robert Denning, Hubert de Givenchy, and Oscar de la Renta. They have written four books illustrated with their work: Pleasure Pavilions and Follies (1995), Garden Vases (2000), Palaces of the Sun King (2002) and Chinoiseries (2006). Beside the value of their reconstruction drawings, the books are notable for their analysis of architecture and its accompanying social history from an architect's perspective, which is highly unusual in a field dominated by writers trained as art historians.

Many working class Irish farmers were tenants under landlords, producing cereals, potatoes and livestock. But only the potatoes remained as food for the farmers themselves; the other products were used for paying the rent and exported from Ireland to Great Britain. These exports continued when the potato crop failed in 1845. Farmers who failed to pay the rent in this situation were evicted from their homes and land. It is estimated that tens of thousands were evicted during the famine. The 300 inhabitants of the townland of Ballinlass in Galway County, in the Barony of Killian, northeast of Mountbellew, were relatively \\"wealthy\\" and able to pay their rent. But despite this fact, they were evicted on 13 March 1846 because the landlord, a Mrs Gerrard, intended to establish a grazing farm where the village was situated. The houses of Ballinlass were demolished by army and police; the people slept in the ruins in the following night. The next day, police and army returned to evict them definitely. Their neighbours were not allowed to take them in. The eviction of the entire village received wide publicity and was 'personally investigated' by Lord Londonderry, who, in a statement to the House of Lords on March 30, 1846 said 'I am deeply grieved, but there is no doubt concerning the truth of the evictions at Ballinlass. Seventy six families, comprising 300 individuals had not only been turned out of their houses, but had even - the unfortunate wretches - been mercilessly driven from the ditches to which they had been taken themselves for shelter..these unfortunate people had their rents actually ready..' Despite widespread condemnation, the eviction order was not rescinded. A Dictionary of Irish History, D.J.Hickey & J.E.Doherty, Gill and Macmillan, Dublin, 1980. Pp. page 24.

It offers education for students ranging from first grade to twelfth grade (approximately ages 7 to 18). With over 6,000 students, MMA is the one of the largest private school in Rajshahi. It is located by the Padma River. The school was founded in 1981. It has a legacy of quality and contemporary education based on Islamic knowledge. The founding principal is Md. Sirajul Islam. The school is one of the famous destinations for quality education in Rajshahi city. Rajshahi is also known as the education city of Bangladesh. The school is situated at the center of the city. It promotes quality education from nursery to twelve class. It is operated by Rajshahi Masjid Mission. Female campus of the school established in 2004 at Seroil. First batch of school participated in Secondary School Certificate (SSC) in 1991 and Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) in 1997.  Controversies  There are allegations that the organization has recruited the accused in the case filed under the anti-sabotage and anti-terrorism law against the mosque mission academy, which is using funds from different countries including the Middle East and abroad. In 2016, the Ministry of Home Affairs of Bangladesh issued a letter to the Ministry of Education based on the intelligence report. It was said that the mosque mission academy school and college were used in the secret political activities of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, which lost its registration for accused in war crime during 1971. Books prescribed by Jamaat-e-Islami outside the books prescribed by the state are taught in this institution. After the controversy arose, the Bangladesh Audit Department completed an audit of the institution and found serious financial inconsistencies. According to their report, the institution collects compulsory money from students in the name of the foundation. No account is kept of the expenditure of this money, which is against the law. Besides, the report also provided information about embezzlement of around Tk 11 crore in 10 years. A member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Ministry of Education told a news conference that the embezzled money had been spent on anti-state activities. At the same time, he complained that no recruitment was done in this institution outside of Islam. There is not even student admission, which is in conflict with the constitution of the country. He revoked the registration of the Masjid Mission Foundation and demanded that the three branches of the Masjid Mission Academy School and College be run in the same way as other educational institutions under the MPO of the state. Against this information, however, a statement under the banner of Alumni of Masjid Mission Academy School and College was published in the Daily Sangram, known as the mouthpiece of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh. Earlier, in 2005, there was a controversy over the teaching methods and curriculum of this institution after finding Mamun, a member of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), a banned organization accused of militancy, and was one of the accused in a series of bombings across the country on August 17 of that year, was a student of this institution.

Cristoforo Landino (1424 in Pratovecchio, Casentino, Florence - 24 September 1498 in Borgo alla Collina, Casentino) was an Italian humanist and an important figure of the Florentine Renaissance. Biography From a family with ties to the Casentino, Landino was born in Florence in 1424. He studied law and Greek (under George of Trebizond). Against his father's will he turned away from a career in the law and decided to study philosophy instead, a decision he would not have been able to make but for the patronage of Piero di Cosimo de' Medici. Landino's wife Lucrezia was a member of the Alberti family. In 1458 Landino replaced Cristoforo Marsuppini as the chair of rhetoric and poetry at the Florentine Studio. His students, seeking a more renowned teacher, initially opposed Landino's appointment, but he nevertheless remained and became an important part of the cultural and intellectual life of Florence. Landino was a member of the Platonic Academy founded by Marsilio Ficino in Florence. He was the tutor of Lorenzo de' Medici and his brother Giuliano. Landino also held public office, first as chancellor of the Guelf party (1467) and later as scriptor of public letters for the Signoria. Landino died in 1498 in a villa in Borgo alla Collina, which he received as a gift from the Medici. Works Orazione alla Signoria fiorentina Historia naturalis translated by Cristoforo Landino, 1489 edition. Landino was a prolific writer. He championed the use of vernacular Italian. He wrote three works framed as philosophical dialogues: De anima (1453), De vera nobilitate (1469), and the Disputationes Camaldulenses (c. 1474). In the Disputationes several humanists compare the merits of the active and the contemplative life. As the lady \\"Xandra\\" Landino published three volumes of Latin poems. They were dedicated in 1458 to Piero de' Medici. He also prepared many letters and orations, which were published long after his death in Italian in Venice (1561). Of special importance to the Renaissance, Landino prepared commentaries on the Aeneid (1478) and The Divine Comedy (1481). To promote the use of vernacular Italian, Landino held lectures on Petrarch and translated and published Pliny's Historia naturalis (1476) and Giovanni Simonetta's Latin life of Francesco Sforza (1490). Among his pupils was historian Andrea Cambini. Editions * Chatfield, Mary P. (trans.).
