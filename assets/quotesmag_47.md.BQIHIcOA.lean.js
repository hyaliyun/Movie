Before the revolution and the advent of feminism in France, women's roles in society consisted of providing heirs for their husbands and tending to household duties. Even in the upper classes, women were dismissed as simpletons, unable to understand or give a meaningful contribution to the philosophical or political conversations of the day. However, with the emergence of ideas such as libert√©, √©galit√©, and fraternit√©, the women of France joined their voices to the chaos of the early revolution. This was the beginning of feminism in France. With demonstrations such as Women's March on Versailles, and the Demonstration of 20 June 1792, women displayed their commitment to the Revolution. Both the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen and the creation of the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women further conveyed their message of women's rights as a necessity to the new order of the revolution.  Inequality During Revolution  During the revolution, doctors and scientists played a significant role in the way society viewed women. Many doctors hypothesized that women could not partake in politics and other aspects of the government since their physiology and anatomy was so different than the physiology and anatomy of men. Scientists, doctors, and people of related professions stated that those with compacted skulls could not practice or follow the sciences (Nature's Body 7). Women's participation in politics was considered useless since men were to keep their wive's, daughter's, sister's, and loved one's values and needs in mind. Women were thought to have the same beliefs, ideals, and desires for France as the men.  Women's March to Versailles  The Women's March to Versailles is one example of protofeminist militant activism during the French Revolution. Though the march was overwhelmingly made up of women by all accounts, they did not make explicitly feminist demands. In the years preceding the Revolution, there was a food shortage in France. People all over the country grew agitated and called for a guarantee of food, with insufficient response from the monarchy. In October 1789, women in the market place of Paris began marching to Versailles, spurred on by revolutionists. As they marched, they drew a large gathering, culminating in the siege of the palace and the royal family being transported to the Tuileries Palace. Though the crowd was led by men such as Stanislas-Marie Maillard, the women's call for bread and their persistence to see their demands met, set the tone for the subsequent events led by women in the Revolution. Their resolve is exemplified by an account of a woman participating in the march, the woman Cheret. \\"The honorable members of the National Assembly, coming to understand that the women were absolutely committed to persist until there was something definite for always, accorded to our twelve deputies.\\" While the march was not an inherently feminist event, the women of the march recalled the victory of \\"our citizenesses clothed in glory, returned by carriage at his majesty's expense, to the city hall in Paris.\\" The women of the march were remembered by posterity of the French Revolution as \\"Mothers of the Nation.\\"  Demanding arms  Pauline L√©on, on March 6, 1791, submitted a petition signed by 319 women to the National Assembly requesting permission to form a garde national in order to defend Paris in case of military invasion.Women and the Limits of Citizenship in the French Revolution by Olwen W. Hufton pg. 23-24 L√©on requested permission be granted to women to arm themselves with pikes, pistols, sabers and rifles, as well as the privilege of drilling under the French Guards. Her request was denied.Rebel Daughters by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 89 Later in 1792, Th√©roigne de M√©ricourt made a call for the creation of \\"legions of amazons\\" in order to protect the revolution. As part of her call, she claimed that the right to bear arms would transform women into citizens.  Participation in demonstrations  On October 5, 1789, over eight hundred women overtook the Hotel de Ville. The women burned all of the papers and files that they found since none of the papers and files had any benefit towards their rights as French citizens. They also searched the hotel for arms and ammunition. The women did not find any ammunition. They did, however, find pikes and two cannons. They took the pikes and cannons and were then followed by Lafayette's national guard. The national guard was sent to subdue the protests. On June 20 of 1792, a number of armed women took part in a procession that \\"passed through the halls of the Legislative Assembly, into the Tuileries Gardens, and then through the King's residence.\\"Rebel Daughters by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 91 Militant women also assumed a special role in the funeral of Jean-Paul Marat, following his murder on July 13, 1793. As part of the funeral procession, they carried the bathtub in which Marat had been murdered as well as a shirt stained with Marat's blood.Women and the Limits of Citizenship by Olwen W. Hufton pg. 31 Later, on May 20, 1795, women were at the fore of a crowd that demanded \\"bread and the Constitution of 1793.\\"Gender, Society and Politics: France and Women 1789-1914 by James H. McMillan pg. 24 When their protest went unnoticed, the women went on a rampage, \\"sacking shops, seizing grain and kidnapping officials.\\"  Women's Role in Society  Although most people in society believed that women should not partake in politics and should stay at home and raise the children, some women did play an important role in politics. This is not focusing on the protests that many women in France were a part of. Those protests shaped the political scene in France during the Revolution. During the French Revolution, women were able to write and publish political journals. The Tribune des femmes and Foi nouvelle: Livre des actes were political journals that were mainly written and published by women. The companies that published these journals had to pay a stamp tax that was only needed when a political journal was being published, therefore, making these two journals political. After the Gazette des femmes was published, the government stepped in and banned women's ability to publish daily political journals specifically.  Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen  While largely ignored in their endeavors to increase the rights of citizens in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, activists such as Pauline L√©on and Th√©roigne de M√©ricourt agitated for full citizenship for women.Rebel Daughters: Women and the French Revolution Edited by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 79 Yet, women were \\"denied political rights of 'active citizenship' (1791) and democratic citizenship (1793).\\" In 1791, Olympe de Gouges published a vital document of the Revolution, the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen. In it, de Gouges replicated the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, but altered the language to reflect the concerns of women's rights within France. She addressed her declaration to the Queen, Marie Antoinette, pleading with her to \\"work for the restoration of morals, to give to your sex all the credit it is due.\\" While this document did not have extensive social repercussions within France during the time of the Revolution, de Gouges revealed the depths of misogynistic culture by the reaction to her work. Following her publication, she was tried as having \\"royalist tendencies\\", further evidenced by her political pamphlets and discovery of her half-written play, La France sauv√©e ou le tyran d√©trond√©. Though according to de Gouges, the accusation was based on a misunderstanding of her texts as anti-revolutionary, feminist historian Janie Vanp√©e took the stance that her trial was \\"not one of holding opinions from the wrong side of the political spectrum, but rather of articulating political opinions at all.\\" De Gouges' execution in 1793, one of only three women to be executed in the Reign of Terror, solidified her appraisal of men within the Revolution as \\"pretend[ing] to enjoy the Revolution and reclaim his rights to equality only to say nothing more about it.\\"  Society of Revolutionary Republican Women  The most radical militant feminist activism was practiced by the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women which was founded by L√©on and her colleague Claire Lacombe on May 10, 1793.Rebel Daughters by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 92 The goal of the club was \\"to deliberate on the means of frustrating the projects of the enemies of the Republic.\\" Up to 180 women attended the meetings of the Society.Deviant Women of the French Revolution and the Rise of Feminism by Lisa Beckstrand pg. 17 Of special interest to the Society was \\"combating hoarding [of grain and other staples] and inflation.\\"Women and the Limits of Citizenship by Olwen W. Hufton pg. 25  Support  Condorcet was a strong advocate for women's rights. He believed that by not allowing women to partake in politics, it would deny them rights that men were entitled to, and it would deny rights to the legislators who vote to fill political positions. The legislators would not be able to vote for a woman to hold a position in the government even if they believed she was fit for the position. According to Condorcet, women were just as capable as men, except when it came to war. He believed that women were not as capable as men in war because of the differences in body structure, physique, and the need to take a leave of absence when their child is born.  Reaction  Most of these outwardly activist women were punished for their actions. The kind of punishment received during the Revolution included public denouncement, arrest, execution, or exile. Th√©roigne de M√©ricourt was arrested, publicly flogged and then spent the rest of her life sentenced to an insane asylum. Pauline L√©on and Claire Lacombe were arrested, later released, and continued to receive ridicule and abuse for their activism. Many of the women of the Revolution were even publicly executed for \\"conspiring against the unity and the indivisibility of the Republic.\\"Deviant Women by Beckstrand pg. 20  Legacy  These are but a few examples of the militant protofeminism that was prevalent during the French Revolution. While little progress was made toward gender equality during the Revolution, the activism of French women and protofeminists was bold and particularly significant in Paris. Though French culture during the time of the Revolution was largely misogynistic, leading women such as Madame Roland, Olympe de Gouges, and Charlotte Corday went against the traditional roles of gender and fought the mindset of a woman as passive, uneducated, and politically ignorant. According to author and historian Catherine R. Montfort, \\"a woman is always a woman biologically, but the ways in which she can be one are constructed by her culture.\\" The effects on women's rights of the French Revolution is debated among historians. For some, the French Revolution eroded women's right by decreasing the role of women in public life due to the repressive measures that were brought into place by the Jacobins. However, for others, the change in psyche that allowed women to establish a gender-based consciousness and the reforms to marriage, divorce and property rendered a significant and ground breaking change to feminist identities and the future of the feminist movement.

History Jubilee Park was created for the benefit of the people of Woodhall Spa by Lady Weigall, who built nearby Petwood, now the famous hotel, as her country house. The park was opened in 1935 by Princess Marie Louise and named to mark the Jubilee of King George V. In its earliest days it was known as ‚ÄòThe Royal Jubilee Park‚Äô. In 1947 the whole park was gifted to the Urban District Council (UDC) and between 1947 and 1974 the UDC put considerable investment into the park and swimming pool and marketed it countywide. Jubilee Park was as synonymous with Woodhall Spa as the Kinema in the Woods and golf (now the home of the English Golf Union). Following local government re-organisation in 1974, the UDC eventually agreed to transfer the park to East Lindsey District Council (ELDC), who were keen to add it to their new property portfolio. Jubilee Park now comprises an open-air swimming pool (Lido), communal gardens, caravan site, tennis club and cricket club. The tennis club and cricket club have operated independently for many years under a leased agreement with ELDC. Some investment took place but over the next 30 years it became increasingly apparent that the park and its facilities would have trouble competing for funds with other, newer, leisure venues in the district. In 2005 when the future of the pool, the caf√© and consequently the park, were in serious doubt, it was not surprising that the community would unite to put pressure on ELDC to invest and save it. The same passions were aroused when it was proposed to close the park's caravan site, with people across the county signing petitions in the belief that not just the caravans, but the park itself was under threat. Woodhall Spa without Jubilee Park would not be Woodhall Spa, and Jubilee Park without the pool would not be Jubilee Park. Woodhall Spa is the acknowledged ‚ÄòJewel in the Crown‚Äô of East Lindsey. Jubilee Park is the ‚ÄòJewel in the Crown‚Äô of Woodhall Spa. Transfer of ownership of Jubilee Park to Woodhall Spa Parish Council took Place in April 2011. This transfer was accompanied by significant investment in ‚Äòfailing‚Äô parts of the infrastructure ‚Äì not least the swimming pool basin and the infrastructure of the caravan park. This injection of capital has secured the operational ability of the Park along with ensuring that key areas remain compliant with necessary legislative requirements. With this operational ability secured, we now needed to secure the park's financial future under local ownership. The first four years were broadly successful although involving a steep learning curve. It quickly became apparent, however, that the Parish Council wasn't set up in a way that could sustain Jubilee Park in the long term and a group of volunteers stepped up to look at possible ways forward. On the 2nd of May 2014, The Parish Council handed over the operation and management of the swimming pool, caravan site and communal gardens to Jubilee Park Woodhall Spa Ltd (JPWS) on a 99-year lease. JPWS took over from this point with the pool opening for the season the next day. The cricket and tennis clubs in the Park maintained separate leases. JPWS is a not-for-profit organisation set up as a company limited by guarantee (company number ‚Äì 8912577). It is also a registered Charity (charity number 1159068). As set in out in its Articles of Association, the objects of the charity are: 1\\\\. To manage, promote and sustain Jubilee Park as a swimming, leisure, sports and recreation facility available for the benefit of the whole community, principally but not exclusively in the local government area of Woodhall Spa. 2\\\\. To promote health and fitness in the community in particular but not exclusively through the provision of swimming, sports and health related training and coaching 3\\\\. To promote, organise and facilitate co-operation and partnership between third sector statutory and other relevant bodies in the achievement of the above purposes. Description The pool measures 33.3 m x 12.5 m. The Park has a small cafe with open air facilities that is open in the summer season and for special events. It serves both the public park and the swimming pool garden area and is run by a local family under a franchise agreement that has a number of years still to run. The Trustees recognise the importance of this facility and there is scope for development. At this time, however, the provision of good sports/health related facilities is being given a higher priority. The Park and its gardens are open to all throughout the year including the children's play area. The Park is popular for family picnics and available sports are bowls, tennis, croquet, cricket (for which there are independent clubs) and mini golf. Parking is provided free. The caravan/camping site has 73 touring pitches and up to 40 tenting pitches. The site is full every weekend and during the school summer holidays. Historically the caravan/camping site has been critical in subsidising the running of the Pool and Park.

Eugene O'Connell (June 18, 1815 - December 14, 1891) was the first Catholic bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Grass Valley, California. Born in County Cavan, Ireland, O'Connell sailed to San Francisco upon the request of Bishop Alemany for priests to serve in the diocese of Monterey. O'Connell was rector of the diocesan seminary, and later appointed to the Vicariate of Marysville, up in the gold fields. The Diocese of Grass Valley later became the Diocese of Sacramento. Early life O'Connell was born June 15, 1815, the eldest of four children, in the parish of Kingscourt, County Cavan. He studied at the diocesan seminary, St. Finian's College in Navan, then at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, and was ordained to the priesthood on May 21, 1842. O'Connell taught at the seminary in Navan from 1843 to 1846. O'Connell then moved to All Hallows College, Dublin. During this time, he witnessed the terrible famine years of 1845-1848 in Ireland. California Mission Delores, 1856 In August 1850, Joseph Sadoc Alemany, Bishop of Monterey, California stopped by All Hallows on his way back from Rome, looking to recruit priests for his new diocese.

In September 1853, he was named pastor of Mission Delores. There he served as rector and professor of the Diocesan Seminary of St. Thomas Acquinas. The following year Father O'Connell was recalled to All Hallows College in Ireland. He left San Francisco in May 1854 and was appointed Dean of All Hallows. On September 26, 1860 Pope Pius IX appointed O'Connell was Vicar Apostolic of the newly established Vicariate Apostolic of Marysville. He journeyed to Rome to ask to be relieved of the appointment.

Bishop of Grass Valley In 1868 the vicariate was erected into the Diocese of Grass Valley and Bishop O'Connell was transferred to this title 3 Feb. of that year. Located in northeastern California, United States, the diocese also included most of Nevada, and, early in its history, Utah and part of Colorado. St. Joseph Church in Marysville served as the pro-cathedral of the vicarate. While the diocese was erected in Grass Valley, O'Connell chose to live in Marysville. He recruited a number of priests to serve in his diocese from All Hallows in Dublin. He served as a Council Father to the First Vatican Council convoked by Pope Pius IX.

It links Thusis on the Hinterrhein at and Filisur at with the spa resort of St. Moritz in Engadine at . Construction of the Albula Railway was begun in September 1898, the opening took place on 1 July 1903, and the extension to St. Moritz commenced operations on 10 July 1904. With its 55 bridges and 39 tunnels, the line is one of the most spectacular narrow gauge railways in the world. On 7 July 2008, the Albula Railway and the Bernina Railway, which also forms part of the RhB, were jointly recorded in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, under the name Rhaetian Railway in the Albula / Bernina Landscapes. The best known trains operating on the Albula Railway are the Glacier Express and the Bernina Express.  History  Preda Up until 1890, the south east of Switzerland was extremely poorly served by railways. Alpine transit traffic was drawn to the Gotthard Railway, so that the construction of transcontinental railways in Graub√ºnden appeared not to be economically viable. Only the success of the Landquart-Davos-Bahn (LD) led to a turning point. In 1895, the LD changed its name to Rhaetian Railway (RhB). Two years later, the people of Graub√ºnden decided, in a referendum, that the RhB would come under state ownership. These two changes created suitable conditions for a rapid construction of further RhB lines, which were intended to open up large parts of the Canton. In 1890, the Davos hotelier Willem-Jan Holsboer proposed the construction of a rail link from Chur via Davos, and through a tunnel under the Scaletta Pass, to St Moritz, and then onwards via the Maloja Pass, to Chiavenna in Italy. Holsboer later had to abandon this planned Scalettabahn, in favour of a route through what was to become the Albula Tunnel. In 1895, the Zurich railway pioneer Adolf Guyer-Zeller presented the idea of an Engadine-Orient-Railway, which would have connected Chur, via Thusis and Engadine, and over the Fuorn Pass, with the Vinschgau and Trieste. Zeller planned this proposed route as a standard gauge line. It would have passed under the Albula Alps through a 12 km long tunnel from the mouth of the Val Tisch to the Inn Valley below Bever. As the Ofenbergbahn, the Engadine-Orient-Railway would also have cut a connection through to the Val M√ºstair. It was only on 30 June 1898 that the Federal Assembly in Bern finally decided on the construction of the Albula Railway. The Federal Assembly thereby also decided against another standard gauge transit railway, and a similarly contemplated railway over the Julier Pass. In 1896, there were only 20 km of standard gauge railway line in Graub√ºnden - and 90 km of narrow gauge railways. (Incidentally, the length of the standard gauge line has remained unchanged to this day, apart from the construction of a new industrial spur line from Chur to Domat / Ems.) Priority was given to the construction of a rail connection to the spa at St Moritz, which at that time was a 14-hour stage coach ride distant from Chur, the terminus of the standard gauge line. The RhB station at Tiefencastel After Thusis was reached from Chur, the construction of the Albula Railway began on 15 October 1898. Unlike the Bernina Railway, which was opened a good ten years later, and operated in fully electrified form right from the start, the Albula Railway was still a steam railway at its conception. Moreover, (and again unlike the Bernina Railway), it was intended to be universally available, particularly for the transport of goods. As the steam locomotives of the time were still not particularly powerful, and in order to permit the highest possible speeds, the maximum gradients were restricted to 3.5%, and the minimum curve radius was also generously defined. Thus, the Albula Railway, in the interests of maximising its effectiveness, did not test the technical bounds of an adhesion railway. However, such an architectural style required a variety of engineering structures. So, for example, the viaducts were exclusively solidly constructed. Especially problematical was the ascent of the valley between Berg√ºn/Bravuogn and Preda, where, in a distance of 5 km as the crow flies, a difference in altitude of over 400 m needed to be overcome. To stay within the maximum gradient parameters, the project supervisor, Friedrich Hennings, devised an intricate alignment, which lengthened the line's formation by 12 km. Two curved tunnels, three spiral tunnels, and a number of bridges overcame the engineering problem, by winding the track around like the thread of a screw. On this part of the line, the construction of the 660 m long Rugnux Spiral Tunnels in particular led to problems, because the 4 ¬∞C cold mountain water hampered the activities of the workers. Slope diagram of the Albula Railway Beyond Preda emerged the centrepiece of the line, the 5866 m long Albula Tunnel, which passes under the watershed between the Rhine and the Danube a few kilometres west of the Albula Pass. With its maximum elevation of above sea level, the tunnel is, after the Furka Tunnel, the second highest alpine tunnel in Switzerland. The creation of the tunnel was hampered by unusual problems caused by outflowing water, and these led to the bankruptcy of the building contractor. A total of 1,316 people were involved in the construction of the Albula Tunnel. Overall, there were 16 fatal accidents involving workers. At 03:00 hours on 29 May 1902, the breakthrough of the two tunnel leads was achieved, at a point from the north portal, and , from the south portal. Tiefencastel and Surava On 1 July 1903, the opening of the section between Thusis and Celerina could be celebrated. As the RhB and the St Moritz municipality were still yet to reach agreement over the site of the St. Moritz station, the inauguration of the 3 km long remaining section had to be delayed to 10 July 1904. Shortages of coal during World War I prompted the RhB to grapple with the task of electrification. On 20 April 1919, the first section of the line to be electrified, the link between Bever and Filisur, was energised with the 11 kV 16 2/3 Hz alternating current system used on the Engadine line. On 15 October 1919, the extension to Thusis followed. Since 1930, the Glacier Express has followed the route of the Albula Railway. The Bernina Express was added after World War II. Both of these trains have since operated as spearheads of the Rhaetian Railway's legendary reputation as a railway company amongst rail fans from around the world. Since the line was equipped with a block safety system in 1969, remote monitoring of train traffic at most stations on the line has been possible. In 2005, the Rail Control Center in Landquart assumed the former tasks of the remote monitoring station at Filisur. The Bever substation was modernised in 1973. Successive extensions to the passing loops at the stations has lengthened them to over , the equivalent of an express train with 13 carriages. Since the end of the 1990s, the RhB has installed three short double track sections - at Thusis, at Filisur and below Preda - to make the hourly train crossings flow more smoothly. The remaining parts of the line are single track as before, and are still largely in their original configuration from 1904. Accidents and incidents : *On 13 August 2014, a passenger train was struck by a landslide and derailed at Tiefencastel, Graub√ºnden. Eleven people were injured.  Description of the railway  The Albula Railway begins in Thusis, where it connects with the Landquart-Chur railway, built in 1896. Behind Thusis station, the line crosses the Hinterrhein, as well as the A 13 Autobahn, and enters the Albula Valley, which, east of Thusis, is known as the Schinschlucht. Even at this early stage, it passes many bridges and tunnels. After Solis station, from Thusis, the line crosses the Albula for the first time, on the high Solis Viaduct, which is both the highest bridge on the Rhaetian Railway, and the broadest span viaduct on the Albula Railway. Some of the new Panorama cars, introduced in 2006, on the Landwasser Viaduct near Filisur Between Tiefencastel and Filisur, the train crosses the m high and long Schmittentobel Viaduct. Shortly before Filisur, it reaches one of the trademarks of the Albula Railway - and often also the Rhaetian Railway in general - the high Landwasser Viaduct, which in a curve of only radius leads directly into a tunnel through the cliff face at the opposite end. Aerial video of a train travelling from Preda to Berg√ºn through several loop tunnels. At Filisur station is the junction between the Albula Railway and the branch line from Davos Platz. Between Filisur and Berg√ºn, the train ascends , and runs through the first spiral tunnel. The next section, between Berg√ºn and Preda, is the most demanding example of rail technology on the Albula Railway: in order to overcome the height difference of between Berg√ºn and Preda ‚Äì in only as the crow flies ‚Äì without requiring excessive slopes or radii, the route is extended by by various engineering structures (including three spiral tunnels, two curved tunnels and four valley crossing viaducts). Soon after departure from Berg√ºn station, where an RhB Crocodile stands as a locomotive monument, the train climbs once again at a rate of 3.5%. By means of the various structures just identified, the line crosses over itself twice. Rail fans can also view the Berg√ºn-Preda section from a rail history nature trail adjacent to the line. At the hamlet of Naz, near Preda, the line crosses a brief plateau, where, for several years now, there has been a double track section about long. Soon after the Preda station, which, at above sea level, is the highest stopping point on the Albula Railway, is the north portal of the Albula Tunnel. After passing through the tunnel, and the Spinas station at the southern portal, the train descends at a slope of up to 3.2%, to arrive in the Oberengadine at Bever, in the Val Bever. Here there is a junction with the Engadine Railway from Scuol-Tarasp. At the next station, Samedan, the line to Pontresina branches off. The Bernina Express takes this branch, which connects the Albula Railway with the Bernina Railway to Tirano. On the other hand, the Glacier Express follows the main line, via Celerina, to the terminus of the Albula Railway at St. Moritz. Map of the Berg√ºn-Preda section Originally, it was planned to extend the Albula Railway via the Maloja Pass, to Chiavenna in Italy. At the terminus of the extension, there was to have been a connection with the Italian railway line that runs along Lake Como to Milan. In light of those plans, the St Moritz station was, and still is, laid out as a through station. Whereas on the Swiss side plans for a line through the Bergell reached an advanced stage, there were, on the Italian side, only vague statements of intent, for a line proceeding onwards from the border at Castasegna. World War I, and the subsequent economic recession, prevented any implementation of the plans. Today, the Maloja Pass route is served by a cross border post bus line.  Train traffic  curved tunnel, shortly after crossing the Albula Viaduct III. Between Chur and St Moritz, there are fast trains every day at regular hourly intervals. These trains have been officially known as RegioExpress services since December 2004. For the section Thusis - St Moritz, the fast trains require 1 hour 34 minutes, and therefore travel at an average speed of . Only the so-called fast train stations are served by these trains. At the other stations, trains have no longer stopped since the 1990s. In Surava and Alvaneu, only some trains still stop, and only then in off peak times. In the high summer season, there are also special tourist oriented express trains with panorama cars, for which reservations and supplements are required. These trains are the Glacier Express from Zermatt to St Moritz, and the Bernina Express from Chur via Samedan and Pontresina to Tirano. The most frequently used motive power on the Albula Railway is the modern Ge 4/4 III class of electric locomotive, which is also in service on the Vereina line. The Albula Railway was once the main stamping ground of the Rhaetian Crocodile (the Ge 6/6 I). The two remaining locos of this class, and the similarly historic Ge 4/6, still operate today at the head of not uncommon special trains. In contrast, the newer RhB locomotives have not achieved the popularity of the Crocodiles. However, they are in everyday use, and the operational difficulties they face can hardly be compared with those to be found on other railways of this magnitude and gauge, due to the nature of the route, and the density of the traffic. Additionally there is, for a narrow gauge railway, unusually dense goods traffic, which in mountainous terrain takes over much of what would otherwise be carried by road traffic. Almost all of the stations on the line are served with goods trains; the larger stations are equipped with (at least) one shunting locomotive of their own. The most important goods transiting the line are timber, cement and other building materials, mineral oil products and foodstuffs. A further area of responsibility of the railway is the transport of cars through the mountainous terrain, together with their passengers. The alpine weather conditions make it impossible to use the alpine passes all year round, whereas with the help of the Albula Railway, the mountain barrier can be overcome without any problems. The Rhaetian Railway therefore offers road users the option of loading their own cars in Thusis onto special car carriers, for transport to Samedan. Albula Railway train near Bever On the Berg√ºn-Preda section, there are also so-called sledding trains operating in winter. These are shuttle services, which carry sledders and tobogganers from Berg√ºn to Preda. At Preda, the sledders and tobogganers connect with the Albula Pass road, which is closed for traffic in winter, and used as a toboggan track to Berg√ºn.

The film was released on 5 February 2010. Made with a budget of the film was grossed more than 8 crore. It was considered as a \\"semi hit\\" and also dubbed and released in Malayalam as Happy 2 Happy. It was remade in Kannada as Jinke Mari. Plot Ajay (Manoj Manchu) and his parents are estranged from their joint family in Rayalaseema. Ajay belongs to the family of Mahendra Naidu (Ahuti Prasad). Seshadri Naidu (Jaya Prakash Reddy) is Mahendra's enemy. They keep killing each other's family members. The story is about how free-spirited Ajay ends this and unites both families. The movie begins with the argument for MP post between Mahendra and Seshadri. The party decides that the seat should go to Mahendra. Seshadri and his sons try to create mayhem so that Mahendra's family doesn't move away from the party building. Meanwhile, Seshadri receives a phone call that his brother-in-law was kidnapped by Mahendra's gang. Dismayed, Seshadri asks his sons and henchmen to leave Mahendra's family for the time-being. Once Mahendra's family leaves the party building, they order their followers to leave Seshadri's brother-in-law. However, Seshadri's brother-in-law is killed. Seshadri wants to kill all of Mahendra's family members for revenge. Mahendra orders his men to bring each and every member of the family to his house so they can be secure. Here comes the introduction of Ajay. He is Mahendra's nephew. Mahendra has three sisters, one of whom is the mother of Girija (Sheena Shahabadi). After some comedy and friendly banter, Girija falls in love with Ajay. Mahendra orders his family not to go out of town. Despite this, Ajay leaves the city with his two cousins to get a cake for Girija's birthday. She makes a bet that should he get the cake, she will kiss him. While returning, the trio stop near a dhaba to get some pakoras. They are attacked by Seshadri's youngest son, who has been staying near the dhaba and maintaining it as his stronghold because he refuses to come home until he fulfills his revenge of killing at least one of Mahendra's family members. Ajay rescues himself and his cousins in time. But Mahendra becomes angry and asks him to leave his house. Ajay reaches the railway station to catch the train so that he can go back to his place. Before boarding the train, he watches news that there was a bomb attack on everyone back in town. Soon, he leaves for Purushottam Naidu's aka \\"Guruji\\" (VijayaKumar) place and takes his advice. Then, Ajay enters into Seshadri's house with the help of his son-in- law Sarath (Sunil) and tries to change everyone. By uniting Seshadri's elder son with his wife and children and his younger son (Subbaraju) with his fianc√©, he is almost at his goal. One celebratory day, he convinces them that they should not harm Mahendra's family but they can do whatever they wish with Mahendra. One of Seshadri's friends recognizes Ajay and reveals the latter's secret. Ajay is on the run because Seshadri's family finds out that he is from the enemy camp, and while escaping, he is stabbed. He also finds out that Seshadri's brother-in-law was killed by Guruji's henchman. Everyone learns the truth. The movie ends happily with the families living together as Seshadri's youngest son marries Mahendra's only daughter.

Early years After a few years living in Russia, Caziel, his mother and stepfather fled Moscow, following the Russian Revolution (1917). Unable to return to their native Poland, they were forced to spend three years in Krasnoyarsk. Then a young boy, Caziel had to work for food and money, and among the many odd jobs he undertook he swept the studios of the local art school, as well as posing as a model for the life classes. Caziel was taken as a prot√©g√© of the art school director and was encouraged by other students to draw and to take interest in art. By the time Caziel and his parents finally reached Poland in 1920, he had decided he would be an artist. The early development of Caziel as a painter took place in Warsaw amongst artists greatly influenced by the School of Paris. His early work, dating 1930s, carried many features characteristic of the expressive manner later so explicit in the works painted in France. In 1931 Caziel entered the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw and became one of the favoured students of Professor Tadeusz Pruszkowski, who ran the academy. Career in France During the Second World War, following the defeat of the Polish army, Caziel went into hiding in Aix-en-Provence, where he found himself at the centre of the milieu of C√©zanne. As a tribute to the great modern master, Caziel painted a series of nudes, shaped by strong contour lines, placed in unusual compositions of depth and perspective and painted with simple colours. He also followed C√©zanne in making the Mont Sainte Victoire his subject for a series of small oils. Back in Paris in 1947 Caziel developed an individual and colourful form of cubist abstraction. He had befriended Picasso who introduced him to the great modernists Le Corbusier and Br√¢ncu»ôi. In Paris Caziel first exhibited at the Galerie Allard (1947), then with Bernheim-Jeune (1948) and at the Salon de Mai (1948‚Äì56). In 1946 he decorated the Polish pavilion at the UNESCO exhibition. During the 1950s, Caziel‚Äôs paintings evolved into rigorous geometrical patterns, anticipating his pure abstract works of the 1960s. These abstract works were exhibited in London at the Grabowski Gallery. British period and late life In 1952, while married to the painter Lutka Pink, Caziel met Catherine Sinclair, also a painter and the eldest daughter of Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso, Secretary of State for Air during the war under Winston Churchill. His divorce from Lutka came five years later and then he married Catherine with whom he had a daughter Clementina. In 1966 and 1968 Caziel had two successful solo exhibitions at the Grabowski Gallery in London and exhibited work at the Royal Academy of Arts. In 1969 he moved to Somerset and was naturalised as a British citizen in 1975. In Somerset, during the last years of his life, Caziel continue to explore Abstraction until his death in 1988.

Distant and local, trans- and cis- eQTLs, respectively  An expression quantitative trait is an amount of an mRNA transcript or a protein. These are usually the product of a single gene with a specific chromosomal location. This distinguishes expression quantitative traits from most complex traits, which are not the product of the expression of a single gene. Chromosomal loci that explain variance in expression traits are called eQTLs. eQTLs located near the gene-of-origin (gene which produces the transcript or protein) are referred to as local eQTLs or cis-eQTLs. By contrast, those located distant from their gene of origin, often on different chromosomes, are referred to as distant eQTLs or trans- eQTLs. The first genome-wide study of gene expression was carried out in yeast and published in 2002. The initial wave of eQTL studies employed microarrays to measure genome-wide gene expression; more recent studies have employed massively parallel RNA sequencing. Many expression QTL studies were performed in plants and animals, including humans, non-human primates and mice. Some cis eQTLs are detected in many tissue types but the majority of trans eQTLs are tissue-dependent (dynamic). eQTLs may act in cis (locally) or trans (at a distance) to a gene. The abundance of a gene transcript is directly modified by polymorphism in regulatory elements. Consequently, transcript abundance might be considered as a quantitative trait that can be mapped with considerable power. These have been named expression QTLs (eQTLs). The combination of whole-genome genetic association studies and the measurement of global gene expression allows the systematic identification of eQTLs. By assaying gene expression and genetic variation simultaneously on a genome-wide basis in a large number of individuals, statistical genetic methods can be used to map the genetic factors that underpin individual differences in quantitative levels of expression of many thousands of transcripts.Cookson et. al Nat Rev Genet. 2009 Mar;10(3):184-94 Studies have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reproducibly associated with complex disorders as well as certain pharmacologic phenotypes are found to be significantly enriched for eQTLs, relative to frequency-matched control SNPs.  Detecting eQTLs  Mapping eQTLs is done using standard QTL mapping methods that test the linkage between variation in expression and genetic polymorphisms. The only considerable difference is that eQTL studies can involve a million or more expression microtraits. Standard gene mapping software packages can be used, although it is often faster to use custom code such as QTL Reaper or the web-based eQTL mapping system GeneNetwork. GeneNetwork hosts many large eQTL mapping data sets and provide access to fast algorithms to map single loci and epistatic interactions. As is true in all QTL mapping studies, the final steps in defining DNA variants that cause variation in traits are usually difficult and require a second round of experimentation. This is especially the case for trans eQTLs that do not benefit from the strong prior probability that relevant variants are in the immediate vicinity of the parent gene. Statistical, graphical, and bioinformatic methods are used to evaluate positional candidate genes and entire systems of interactions.

The race takes place in Singapore. The marathon is organized by the same team that made the Aviva Ironman 70.3 Singapore Triathlon possible. It attracts a diverse group of athletes and managed to attract 10,670 entrants in 2009. There are different races and they are namely the ultramarathon (84.39 km), the marathon (42.195 km), the Women (10 km) and the Team/Corporate Challenge (10 km x 4 runners). The races all fall on the same night with different start times. In 2011, 84 km ultramarathon was replaced with 100 km ultramarathon. Runners are required to pay a fee to participate in the race. The price varies according to registration date, race selected, and the runners' history of participation in the event.  History  The 2011 Sundown Marathon marked the first time that the races did not take place on the same night. The marathons took place on 28 May 2011, while the ultramarathon took place 25 June 2011. The 2020 edition of the race was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, with all registered runners gaining direct entry into the 2021 edition of the race. As of 3 March 2009, more than 10,000 men and women had signed up for ‚ÄúSingapore‚Äôs Toughest Race‚Äù. This total breaks the event‚Äôs previous entry record of 6,088 participants. Despite the fact that it is a relatively new race present in Singapore, the overwhelming response shows its potential to become a well- respected event. The 2009 event‚Äôs route traveled through some of east‚Äôs most beautiful urban parks as well as major local landmarks such as Bedok Reservoir, East Coast Park and the Changi Ferry Terminal; all set to the backdrop of Singapore‚Äôs night sky. A new addition to the event is also the introduction of the Women‚Äôs 10 km which has garnered remarkable response from the public which totaled around 2,200 runners.  Impact and discernible trends of the event  The event has an economic impact from the number of workers that it employs and the tourism that it brings to the area. = Tourism receipts = As the sundown Marathon is the largest night race held in Asia and Singapore, it was largely lauded and publicized (due to successful previous year) and this second year has seen an increase in foreign participants, especially from Malaysia and other neighboring countries. ‚ÄúOf the 600 entrants, the Adidas Sundown Marathon will also be hosting one of the biggest contingents of international. Ultramarathon runners with more than 12% of the participants coming from beyond Singapore's borders.‚Äú = Events as attractions = Sundown Festival Village: ‚ÄúOrganisers HiVelocity have announced a slew of activities at the village including a free outdoor movie marathon. Frozen yogurt experts, Frolick, will also be giving away 3,000 free cups of Frolick yoghurt to festival village visitors throughout the night. While microbrewery and restaurant, Brewerkz, will be quenching thirsty throats and hungry stomachs with a specially packaged ‚ÄòSundown Picnic Basket' of beers, soft drinks and juicy flame-grilled burgers. With so many wide open spaces at the park, it'll be a great time for all the family to have a nocturnal picnic before, during or after the race.‚Äù Sponsors and supporters will gain economically from the events held and attract even more non-runners. = Sociocultural = The Sundown Marathon also has a positive sociocultural impact. Sundown Marathon organizers make use of Singapore‚Äôs numerous parks while planning the route, which brings runners through \\"some of east's most beautiful urban parks as well as major local landmarks such as Bedok Reservoir, East Coast Park and the Changi Ferry Terminal; all set to the backdrop of Singapore's night sky.‚Äù Sundown Festival village also made use of large spaces of the park to organize this family friendly event. The organizers strive to keep the routes clean, avoiding litter on the ground. This is kept in check by cleaners and volunteers. A marathon itself may be enough to spur people on in terms of morale and determination but the Sundown Marathon makes good use of this opportunity with the different categories for the race. It includes a corporate race, which is fully registered and booked by local and multinational companies for their workers by the time registration closed. The corporate race enables company bonding and can motivate workers as well. = Health = The Sundown Marathon is a way to promote both mental and physical health. Running a marathon promotes a healthy lifestyle. As marathon runners often spend months training for the events, this lifestyle can even continue after the race. Friends and family may also become motivated and encouraged to lead a healthier lifestyle. Marathon runners often set their own goals for the race in terms of timing and distances covered. Being able to achieve these goals highly motivates the runners mentally and enables them to gain a higher self-confidence. There are also health risks that are associated with running long distances. They may include injuries such as tendonitis, fatigue, knee or ankle sprain, extreme dehydration (electrolyte imbalance), as well as others. Although it is rare, death is even possible during a race.Keener, Candace. (27 February 2008) HowStuffWorks \\"The Health Risks of the Marathon\\". Entertainment.howstuffworks.com. Retrieved on 2 December 2011.  Sports tourist involved in the program  The event increases tourism both through international runners and the spectators that come. At the Sundown Marathon, there are a large number of international runners competing. For the 2009 event, there were altogether 600 entrants in the ultra marathon race. Of the 600 runners, 12% of them were international runners, coming from places like Morocco and Africa. Their ages ranged from 18 to 72. The international runners may bring supporters and friends with them as well, also coming from all over the world. Their ages of the spectators are even more diverse than that of the runners because they can still support even if they are too old or young to run themselves.

The site is owned by the Homestake Mining Company, and is the site of the now-closed McLaughlin Mine. The nature reserve protects California interior chaparral and woodlands habitat, in the Northern Inner California Coast Ranges. History A signed agreement between Homestake Mining Company and the University of California established the reserve as a research and teaching facility in January 1993. The Ray Krauss Field Station was established on the reserve in 1998 and hosts university courses and research such as geology, plant evolution and genetics, among others. Although the reserve is not open to the general public, there are workshops, lectures, and guided field hikes available. In 1999, Homestake Mining Company was given the Corporate Habitat of the Year award by the nonprofit Wildlife Habitat Council for the company's reclamation efforts and projects. The Homestake McLaughlin Mine Habitat Program includes sensitive species protection, restoring disturbed areas and monitoring of wildlife and habitats. The reserve is named for and located at the site of the McLaughlin gold mine, Between 1985 and 2002 the mine produced about 3.4 million ounces of gold, with a current value of about $US 4 billion (at $1200 per oz). \\"It's serving as a model for how used-up mines can have a second life,\\" states Sylvia McLaughlin, the reserve's namesake ., an environmental activist who also cofounded Save The Bay, to protect the San Francisco Bay from infill and pollution. Homestake Mining Company bought the land in 1981 from William Wilder, owner of the One Shot Mining Company which included the abandoned Manhattan Mercury Mine. The historic Manhattan mining pit became McLaughlin's. In 1992, Homestake purchased the nearby Gamble Ranch, and with a boundary adjustment, historic Knoxville as well. At the McLaughlin Natural Reserve, the town of Knoxville is a few stone walls, all that is left from a mining community of 300 people and fifty buildings during its heyday of the 1880s. In 2006 the National Science Foundation gave the University of California Natural Reserve System more than $65,000 for construction of a greenhouse at the Mclaughlin reserve which is within the UC reserve system.

Two investigators try to figure out what happened and uncover an alien plot to steal bodies of earthlings by snatching them out of the air.John Hamilton, Beasts in the Cellar: The Exploitation Film Career of Tony Tenser, Fab Press, 2005 p 155-156 The film was also released as Invasion of the Body Stealers. Plot When British paratroopers disappear in mid-air during routine jumps, former air force investigator Bob Megan (Patrick Allen) is brought in to solve the mystery. While making inquiries at a military research laboratory headed by Dr Matthews (Maurice Evans), he has several encounters with a woman called Lorna (Lorna Wilde) who vanishes after each meeting. One of the troopers is found barely alive and dies on arrival at the laboratory. An autopsy performed by Dr Julie Slade (Hilary Dwyer) reveals that the man's biochemistry had been altered. Megan learns that all of the missing troopers had received spaceflight training, leading Matthews to theorise that they are being adapted to survive in a non-Earth environment. Travelling to Matthews' cottage, Slade discovers that the human Matthews has been killed and his form assumed by an alien called Marthus. When Megan arrives, Marthus explains that the troopers were abducted as part of a plan to re-populate his home planet, Mygon, which has been devastated by plague. Marthus attempts to kill Megan and Slade but is incapacitated by Lorna, who is revealed to be his alien companion. Lorna shows Megan the surviving troopers, who are being held in suspended animation, as well as her and Marthus' spacecraft. Megan asks Lorna to return the troopers in exchange for his promise to find a group of volunteers to assist her with the re-population.

Individuals from more than 100 countries added their voices to this process and their submissions were read and commented upon by more than 150,000 visitors to the site. The Council of Conscience, a multi-faith, multi- national group of religious thinkers and leaders, then met in Vevey, Switzerland, to craft the final Charter for Compassion. The Councilors sorted and reviewed the thousands of written submissions, considered the meaning of compassion, determined key ideas to include in the Charter and created a plan for how the Charter will live in the world. The Charter for Compassion was unveiled by Karen Armstrong and the Council of Conscience on November 12, 2009, at the National Press Club in Washington, DC. That day, more than 75 launch events took place around the globe and more than 60 Charter for Compassion plaques designed by Yves Behar were hung at significant religious and secular sites around the world. At its launch, the Charter was endorsed by the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu among many others.  Charter for Compassion -- The Organization  Just a few months after Armstrong was awarded the TED Prize, a partnership of individuals and organizations around the world began coalescing to bring the Charter for Compassion to life. On May 4, 2009, the Compassionate Action Network (CAN) was launched in Seattle. CAN's intention, expressed in its founding document, was to create \\"an association of like-minded programs, projects and organizations that collectively represent the power of thousands of relationships.\\" CAN became the home for the Charter for Compassion from the summer of 2012 through December 2013 and provided a wealth of startup assistance to the Charter organization, including staff, fundraising, resource development, and strategic planning. With the support of CAN, the Fetzer Institute and many other groups and individuals committed to the Charter's ideals, the Charter for Compassion grew steadily in scale and scope. In January, 2014, almost six years after the TED Prize award, a group of leaders in the movement organized as the Global Compassion Council and formed the Charter for Compassion (CFC) as a non-profit(c)(3) organization. The Global Compassion Council became CCI's advisory panel. = CFC vision, mission and logo = Charter for Compassion's vision is to foster a world where everyone is committed to living by the principle of compassion. Its mission is to support the emergence of a global movement that brings the Charter for Compassion to life. It does this by being a network of networks‚Äîconnecting organizers and leaders from around the world; providing educational resources, organizing tools and avenues for communication; sharing lessons, stories and inspiration; and providing an umbrella for Charter for Compassion conferences, events, collaborations, conversations and initiatives to create compassionate communities and institutions around the globe. The CFC logo incorporates the ancient symbol for infinity. The symbol has long been used to represent the concept of endless love. CFC's use of the symbol in the context of the Charter for Compassion represents the limitless potential of compassion to transform human relationships, institutions and communities. = Self-Organizing Structure = Traditional organizational structures are hierarchical: a leader, sometimes in consultation with a board of directors, determines a goal for an enterprise and directs other people to carry out the steps necessary to reach that goal. CFC supports self-organization, believing that sustainable change emerges organically from communities. As such, it facilitates connections between resources, individuals and organizations with the intent of supporting (not controlling) outcomes of increasing compassion. Because it has more than 2,000 partners, and those partners support networks as well, CFC describes itself as a \\"network of networks.\\" CFC sees networks as the first, critical step in systemic reorganization of the type necessary to make compassion an organizing, luminous force. The advisory body for CFC is the Global Compassion Council, which consists of leaders in the global compassion movement from the realms of government, business, education, philanthropy, religion and spirituality, healthcare, the environment, peace and social justice. The CFC governing Board of Trustees is drawn from members of the Council. Board members (2016) are: Rev. Dr. Joan Brown Campbell, president; Dr. James Doty, M.D., vice-president; Toni Murden McClure, treasurer; and the following members: Allan Boesak, Amin Hashwani, Imam Mohamed Magid and Amy Novogratz. Karen Armstrong is an ex-officio member of the Board. CFC activities largely are delegated to made up primarily of volunteers. Located all over the world, the teams function virtually and, where there are several people in one geographic area, in person. There is a weekly teleconference staff meeting where participants review their work and contribute to and make decisions on current CFC initiatives. Also, many of the volunteers are facilitators on CFC's regularly scheduled sector- and theme- based conference calls. The International Teams help support the daily operational work of the Charter, which includes overseeing and contributing to the Charter's website. Additionally, they support and help grow CCI's partner network and its campaigns to encourage compassionate cities and communities. Team volunteers also work on special Charter initiatives such as the Charter Community Tool Box, the Charter Education Institute and informational materials on the Charter.  Major Initiatives  = Compassionate Communities = At the heart of the Charter for Compassion's work is its Campaign for Compassionate Communities. In the beginning, this effort was focused on building a network of cities, but it soon became evident that communities both larger and smaller than cities wanted to join the movement to embrace compassion as a core value. The Charter's growing network of Compassionate Communities encompasses nearly 50 countries and includes cities, towns, townships, shires, hamlets, villages, neighborhoods, islands, states, provinces, and counties. Of these, more than 76 cities globally have affirmed the Charter for Compassion through city, community councils or other government entities. Affirming the Charter means that a community has identified issues on which they are working, and have committed to a multi- year action plan. A list of participating communities can be found here. CFC's Compassionate Communities program is not a certificate program that offers a seal of approval, nor does it subscribe to a single definition of a compassionate community. Instead, the Charter invites communities of all sizes to bring compassion to life in practical, specific ways through compassion- driven actions‚Äîin neighborhoods, businesses, schools and colleges, healthcare, the arts, local government, peace groups, environmental advocacy groups and faith congregations. Any individual, group or organization that recognizes the need for greater compassion in a community is encouraged to begin the process for creating a Compassionate Community. While the Charter does not prescribe any one path, it does recommend that the process be designed and carried out by a diverse and inclusive coalition of people so that all voices within the community are heard, and the significant issues are addressed. The Charter for Compassion has developed a four-part model or framework, called the Charter Community Tool Box, to help communities build a compassionate society. The Tool Box is intended to provide communities with a starting point and a process to follow, though it is adaptable to the unique circumstances of any community that seeks to become a Compassionate Community. There are four broad phases: Discover and Assess; Focus and Commit; Build and Launch; Evaluate and Sustain. For each of the phases the Tool Box includes more specific steps as well as stories and examples. Depending on the community, its particular issues and available resources, this process may take one or more years. Within the Charter Tool Box are relevant references to the University of Kansas‚Äô Community Tool Box, with which the Charter collaborated on this project. The Charter's model for building Compassionate Communities resides on the University of Kansas‚Äô Community Tool Box website. The cities and communities that sign on to become Compassionate Cities and Communities often begin their work by identifying issues that are troubling the community and need to be addressed through compassionate action. For example, a community may discover a significant issue related to social justice for women, immigrants or some other marginalized group. Other communities may want to address issues of drug use, gang violence, the lack of equitable healthcare, or the effects of racism. Others may decide to work to empower youth or to educate their communities about the need for compassion in addressing environmental issues.  Louisville, KY‚ÄîModel City  Louisville, KY, is a shining example of a Compassionate Community, having been named the ICC‚Äôs Model City of the year for four consecutive years (2012‚Äì2015). Louisville was the seventh city to sign on to the Compassion Charter, and Mayor Greg Fischer created Compassionate Louisville to help develop and implement a city-wide campaign to nurture and champion the growth of compassion. One of its signature events is the annual Mayor's Give a Day Week, in which the entire city makes time for volunteering, service and compassion. In 2015, the city broke its own world record, with more than 166,000 volunteers and acts of compassion. Compassionate Louisville‚Äôs education team launched the Compassion Bench project, which is designed to provide safe spots in the community where children are encouraged to express compassion. The first was installed at the Louisville Islamic Center on the heels of an act of vandalism there that ultimately served only to unify the community. Mayor Fischer noted that the vandalism at the mosque illustrates the heart of compassion in Louisville. Within hours of the terrible act, dozens of community and religious leaders showed up at an 8 a.m. press conference to denounce the hate and make plans for a community cleanup the next day. That cleanup drew a crowd of nearly 1,000 people‚Äîmen, women and children; people of all color, nationality, religion and political leanings. ‚ÄúIf the vandals‚Äô goal was to highlight division, they failed miserably,‚Äù said Mayor Fischer. ‚ÄúThis is a city that rejects hate, and the response to the incident at the mosque was a beautiful illustration of the work we‚Äôve done to become a community of even greater compassion.‚Äù Other examples of the city‚Äôs commitment to compassion in 2015 include: * The community‚Äôs Give Local Louisville effort brought in almost $3 million for local charities in one day. * Members of Compassionate Louisville‚Äôs Coordinating Circle have mentored more than 40 other communities interested in joining the Compassionate Cities movement, including surrounding counties like Henderson, Ky., as well as large cities like Detroit. * In April, Mayor Fischer announced that Louisville and Jefferson County Public Schools will serve as the site of an independently funded, $11 million health and wellness project focused on teaching caring for oneself and others. * Louisville supported and competed in the ‚ÄúCompassion Games: Survival of the Kindest!‚Äù in September, joining cities across the nation in vying to post the greatest number of good deeds in an 11-day stretch in September. * Nearly 100 local organizations and businesses have made a commitment to compassion this year, including the international YUM! Brands and Brown-Forman. * Metro Louisville has lined up almost 100 volunteer mentors to work one-on-one with at-risk youth in a program called ‚ÄúRight Turn.‚Äù And Louisville Metro Government itself launched Metro Mentors, which allows and encourages city employees to spend two hours of paid time each week working with at-risk youth. * In March, area nonprofits worked with Liberians in our community to fill a huge ocean-going container with emergency meals, water purification and medical supplies and equipment for Ebola victims and families and for those suffering the aftermath of the civil war in Liberia. = Charter for Compassion Partners = Charter for Compassion believes it is possible‚Äîand indeed, urgently necessary‚Äîto tap into humanity's common desire for a more compassionate and peaceful world by building a vast interconnected network of compassion among the peoples of the Earth. It encourages groups, organizations, and institutions to join the Charter for Compassion‚Äôs network of networks by signing on as a partner, at no cost, in any one of its current sectors: Arts, Business, Education, Environment, Healthcare, Peace and Non- violence, Religion/Spirituality/Interfaith, Restorative Justice, Science and Research, Social Justice, Social Service, and Women and Girls. These partners represent a vast range of activities. In the science and research field, for example, Stanford University‚Äôs Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education is conducting research into mapping compassion in the brain and developing compassion training programs for adults. In the Netherlands, an impassioned group of medical students has written a charter focused on medical ethics and compassion in healthcare. They are working to make compassion training a required part of the medical school curriculum. In education, partners around the globe have translated the Charter for children and many schools are using compassionate curricula developed for all age levels. Pakistan, one of the most active Charter partners, introduces a compassionate character into the Pakistani Sesame Street, Sim Sim Harama. Pakistan is working closely with Jordan, on the other side of the Gulf, in education efforts. In Jordan one compassionate school is housed in a tent and follows nomads through the Jordanian desert. Another project trains prison officers to treat inmates with more respect and care. When it was put into practice in a jail in Washington State, the goal was to decrease violence by 2.5 percent; in fact the project was so successful that violence was decreased by 100 percent. Now the creators are evaluating just what the federal government could save by implementing this program across the United States. = The Charter for Compassion Education Institute = The Charter for Compassion Education Institute was formed in 2016 to educate and prepare people of the world to live a compassionate life, to understand the power of compassion to transform the inequities and injustices of human civilization, and to spread compassion and compassionate action throughout the world. The Education Institute successfully launched its first online course in September 2016 with students from six countries and has several exciting courses lined up for Spring 2017. These first courses deal with how to develop compassion for others, how to learn self-compassion, and how to become a part of the growing compassion movement and the Charter for Compassion. Eventually, CFC will offer courses that address the work of compassion in many contexts‚Äîin communities, healthcare, business, education, religion and interfaith, the arts, restorative justice, environment, and science. Instructors from several countries are in the process of developing online courses.

Its sister publication, ArtReview Asia, was established in 2013. History Launched as a fortnightly broadsheet in February 1949 by a retired country medical practitioner, Dr Richard Gainsborough, and the first edition was designed by his wife, the artist Eileen Mayo, Arts News and Review set out to champion contemporary art in Britain, providing its readers with commentary, news and reviews. At the outset its focus was set firmly on the artist ‚Äì its regular cover ‚ÄòPortrait of the artist‚Äô introduced its readership to emerging artists as well as reconnecting with the past masters of modernism from before the war. Cover artists included √âdouard Manet, Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and Lucien Freud. As its editorial would declare in 1954, Art News and Review's purpose was ‚Äòto stimulate the criticism of contemporary art, to give to both painters and writers space they would never find elsewhere, and to endeavour to present a balanced and comprehensive picture of living art in twentieth-century Britain.‚Äô Critics such as David Sylvester and John Berger, cut their teeth in its pages during the 1950s, as it covered the growing trend of abstract art, and the lively debates provoked by the arrival of American Abstract Expressionism, while Lawrence Alloway and Reyner Banham celebrated new attitude towards art that embraced science, industry and mass culture, elaborating the terms of what became known as ‚ÄòPop‚Äô art. In 1954 Henri Matisse wrote for the magazine. Renaming itself Arts Review in March 1961, the magazine charted the advent of Pop art and the sharper look of ‚ÄòNew Generation‚Äô sculpture and hard-edge painting, while young critics like Brian Sewell balanced the merits of non-figurative art against socialist realism, and Jasia Reichardt, the assistant editor of the title, looked towards art's growing involvement with technology. By the end of the 1960s Arts Review was pondering the ‚Äòunparalleled fragmentation‚Äô in art, remarking that art ‚Äòhas still to find the power to draw communities together, and heal‚Äô. Socially- minded young critics such as Richard Cork, Peter Fuller and Janet Daley would bring their voices to the complexities of conceptual art in the recession-hit 1970s, a period marked by a conservative backlash against contemporary art. Arts Review weathered the economic turmoil of a changing art market into the 1980s, widening its attention to the resurgent markets and cultures of craft and design, while following the turn towards the new figurative painting and sculpture that characterised art in Britain during the Thatcher decade. By 1993 Arts Review had relaunched as the monthly magazine Art Review. Sensing a new, more youthful and irreverent mood taking shape in contemporary art, it put Gilbert & George on the cover, and drew a growing readership to the work of the 'Young British Artists‚Äô, towards the internationalising artworld of the 2000s. By 2006 ArtReview had reinvented itself once more, to grapple with the artistic product of an artworld now thriving not only in Britain, Europe and the US, but also in Asia, Latin America and Africa. Artists featured on the cover have included Yayoi Kusama, Subodh Gupta, Liam Gillick, Ai Weiwei, Thomas Hirschhorn, Keren Cytter, Steve McQueen, Yael Batana, Phyllida Barlow, Dora Maurer, Tacita Dean, Danh Vo, Sarah Lucas, Fernanda Gomes, Ragnar Kjartansson, Geta BrƒÉtescu. In 2012 ArtReview published a special supplement on Brazilian art history, and has since expanded its coverage of the country's art scene. In 2018 it produced an issue looking at the legacy of the Situationists. In June 2019, the magazine announced that Modern Media Holdings had acquired a majority stake in its publisher ArtReview Ltd.

The magazine claims that the list is judged according to a person's ability to influence the type of art that is being produced today, play a role in shaping the public perspective of art, they have to have been active in the previous 12 months before the list is published and have to have an international rather than exclusively domestic influence. In October 2011, the magazine was criticised by the Chinese government for placing Ai Weiwei at number one of that year's Power 100.

Yeats composed the poem in response to the 1927 assassination of Kevin O'Higgins, the Vice-President of the Free State, whom Yeats had known personally. The poem contains many themes common in Yeats's poems from the 1920s including the \\"tower\\", a reference to Thoor Ballylee, which had been the title of a collection of works printed the year before \\"Blood and the Moon\\" was published, as well as the \\"gyre\\" which had been a major focus of his 1920 poem \\"The Second Coming\\". Background The murder of Kevin O'Higgins acted as a catalyst for Yeats's creation of the poem. As Vice President and Minister of Home Affairs in the Cosgrave Government, O'Higgins had enforced the Army Emergency Powers Act and condemned seventy-seven Republican \\"irregulars\\", including author Erskine Childers and many men with whom O'Higgins had been allies during the Irish War of Independence. O'Higgins was assassinated by a Republican gunman on 10 July 1927.Finneran 2000 pp.392‚Äì393 When Yeats heard the news that O'Higgins had been murdered, he refused to eat and spent his evening walking along the streets until the sun set.Jeffares 1996 p.255 Thoor Ballylee, Yeats's poetic model for the poem's tower, was a 16th-Century Norman castle in the Barony of Kiltartan, Ireland. The building was originally called \\"Islandmore Castle\\" and \\"Ballylee Castle\\", yet Yeats changed the name when he purchased the building in 1917 for ¬£35. Yeats believed that the word \\"castle\\" was too magnificent and used the word \\"Thoor\\" instead as it was an anglicisation of the Irish for \\"tower\\", 't√∫r'. Yeats credits the landmark as being the inspiration for the poem's setting. At the top of the tower was a waste room, which inspired the image of the empty room discussed in lines 8-12:Bornstein p.28 :In mockery I have set :A powerful emblem up, :And sing it rhyme upon rhyme :In mockery of a time :Half dead at the top. At the time that Yeats purchased the tower, it had seventy-three stairs that are described in lines 16-18 of the poem: :I declare this tower is my symbol; I declare :This winding, gyring, spiring treadmill of a stair is my ancestral stair; :That Goldsmith and the Dean, Berkeley and Burke have travelled there. The castle consisted of four stories. On the first floor was the dining room, and the living room was found on the second. The third story contained the bedroom, and the top story contained the \\"Strangers' room\\" which and a secret room. It was also on this story that the tower's large windows opened up over the millstream below. The windows are mentioned in the poem on lines 43-46:Bushrui 1990 pp.70‚Äì71 :Upon the dusty, glittering windows cling, :And seem to cling upon the moonlit skies, :Tortoiseshell butterflies, peacock butterflies, :A couple of night-moths are on the wing. Structure The poem is arranged in four stanzas that lack symmetry and vary in size and structure. The first stanza contains three quatrains with a rhyme scheme of abba which contain no breaks between the lines. The second stanza contains 18 lines of text with six long-lined tercets using a rhyme scheme of aaa, which causes it to appear very different on the page from the stanzas that precede and follow it. The third stanza is a douzain, a square block of twelve lines of verse composed of pentameter quatrains with a rhyme scheme of abba. The fourth and final stanza repeats the structure of the one that precedes it.Vendler 1972 pp.80‚Äì81 Yeats explained the structure by suggesting that the poem is arranged on the page to visually represent the images described in the text. The first stanza represents the tower introduced in line 2. He claims to have composed these lines so that they would look long and slender on the page to achieve the outline of the tower's structure. The second stanza represents the \\"winding, gyring, spiring treadmill of a stair\\" mentioned in line 17, which would account for the fact that the stanza lacks symmetry among its lines, which appear to extend to various lengths across the page in a way not seen in the other stanzas. Stanzas three and four, identical in form and appearance on the page, represent two ways of looking at the tower windows. Stanza three represents the windows \\"glittering\\" from the light of the moon passing through the glass, and stanza four represents the \\"dusty\\" inside surface upon which the trapped butterflies cling.Vendler 1972 pp.81 Themes According to literary critic Northrop Frye, \\"Blood and the Moon\\" attempts to portray the achievements of a civilization using allegory, describing the top of the tower that society builds as being an area of death and decay. In the poem, the butterflies that reach the top of the tower are unable to escape through the window and are littered around the room. The second stanza is devoted to describing other methods that poets had used to try to explain the attempt of artists to build their own towers to elevate civilization through poetry only to find, Jonathan Swift in particular, themselves dragged \\"down into mankind\\".Frye 1970 p.273 The contrasting elements of the blood described in line 3 and the \\"purity\\" of the unclouded moon in line 30 represents a major theme of the work. The moon's surface appears unchanging and contrasts with the earth that has been stained with the blood of men as the result of \\"arrogant power\\". As the poem speaks of the pristine nature of the moon's surface in the third stanza Helen Vendler suggests that it broadens the contrast between the two surfaces to highlight the difference between \\"the mortal and the incorruptible\\". However, she also states that the poem's theme of life and death shifts focus in the final stanza as the poet discusses the trapped butterflies, which \\"brings into view the pathos of life, rather than its violence\\".Vendler 1972 pp.85‚Äì86 Critical response In his book Yeats, critic Harold Bloom describes the poem as being splendid, though theatrical, suggesting that the second stanza is the only part of the poem that fails to achieve its objective, calling it a \\"pseudo-Swiftian rant\\".Bloom 1972 pp.377‚Äì378 Vendler also comments on the stanza, suggesting that the fact that it is the only one to have breaks between the lines as well as the incongruity of its form in relation to the others. Bloom, however, uses the problem with the second stanza to show that the poem has flaws that do not exist in other works Yeats wrote in the same period, suggesting that while the poem is \\"honest\\", the \\"strength is not there\\".

He is best known for his work for the defense at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal. International Military Tribunal of the Far East In 1946-1948, he served as a defense counsel at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal, and defended Shigenori T≈çg≈ç. T≈çg≈ç's role at the trial was a significant one, since he was a member of the civilian government, not a military official. T≈çg≈ç was ultimately depicted as a reluctant participant in Hideki Tojo's war cabinet and in Japanese empire-building more generally, in spite of his having led the Greater East Asia Ministry after 1943. T≈çg≈ç was spared the death penalty and instead declared guilty of five of the nine counts against him and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. Blakeney concurrently served as defence counsel for General Yoshijir≈ç Umezu, who was sentenced to life imprisonment. Blakeney's arguments at the Tokyo Trials in May 1946 have attracted attention from some Japanese audiences. Some of his statements have been interpreted as critical of the trial's overall hypocrisy, particularly one statement which criticised censorship of discussion of the atomic bombings of Japan. Right- wing artist Kobayashi Yoshinori's 2006 manga \\"Class-A War Criminals\\" brought this speech into further notoriety. In the most heavily-quoted excerpt from his remarks, Blakeney noted that killing by a nation, wartime or peacetime, and even waging a war of aggression, could not be considered crime under international law. The defence counsel for Togo briefly juxtaposed the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in relation to the attack on Pearl Harbor, saying: Ben Blakeney at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East Blakeney's speech was covered in the New York Times, but was overshadowed the same day in the courtroom by an incident where Shumei Okuma slapped Tojo Hideki and made a scene later by crying and praying. In the months following, a number of defense counsel resigned, but Blakeney continued his work for the defense team, arguing that the court should not create a double standard where the Japanese were punished but others were allowed to go free for committing acts of war. In August 1947, Blakeney reviewed the history of US-Japan unsuccessful negotiations that led to war in December 1941, emphasising that the Tojo cabinet had not predetermined to attack the United States, but that the US communication to Japan on 26 November 1941 was the final trigger on the decision to go to war with the United States. On 19 November 1948, one week after the sentences had been handed down, Blakeney produced a review of his defendant's case for General Douglas MacArthur. Blakeney, together with defense attorney George Furness, filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of the United States on behalf of the convicted Japanese officials, arguing that the ruling could not be upheld because General Douglas MacArthur had acted unconstitutionally in constituting the tribunal. The appeal was denied. After the International Military Tribunal for the Far East concluded, Blakeney defended Admiral Soemu Toyoda in one of the more significant postwar cases regarding the doctrine of command responsibility. Later life In 1949, he began work as a lecturer of law at Tokyo University. Blakeney later worked with T≈çg≈ç Fumihiko to translate and edit The Cause of Japan, a book which had been drafted by an ill T≈çg≈ç Shigenori. The book included an extensive introduction by Blakeney, but was criticised quickly after its publication in English in 1956. One reviewer called the book \\"pedantic and impersonal...[it] placed an embarrassing amount of responsibility [for war] at the door of the United States.\\" Bruce Blakeney was killed in a plane crash in 1963.

It is the former Regional Command East of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The United States Army provides the force headquarters. The command headquarters is located in Laghman Province. TAAC-East includes the provinces of Kapisa, Kunar, Laghman, Nangarhar, Nuristan, Panjshayr and Parwan. It shares a portion of the border with Pakistan.  History as Regional Command ‚Äì East  Prior to 2014, the formation was known as Regional Command ‚Äì East (RC‚ÄìEast). In June 2003, 25th Infantry Division (Light) Division Artillery deployed to Afghanistan to fulfill a unique mission. Division Artillery headquarters would serve as the headquarters of Regional Command East, which was to cover 16 provinces in the east of the country.https://web.archive.org/web/20050203043418/http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/jan2005/a012505la1.html It was led by the division artillery commander, and comprised the 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment (25 ID), 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines, 3rd Battalion, 116th Infantry Regiment (29 ID), three forming Afghan kandaks (battalions), and, eventually, a total of eight Provincial Reconstruction Teams.Christopher N. Koontz, Enduring Voices, 7-8. The formal transfer of authority between 10th Mountain and 25th Infantry took place on 15 April 2004. Responsibility for Regional Command East originally fell to the 6th Marines. The area of operations included Bamyan, Parwan, Kapisa, Nuristan, Kunar, Laghman, Kabul, Wardak, Logar, Nangarhar, and Ghazni Provinces. The 25th Infantry Division Artillery headquarters, commanded by Col. Gary H.

Major Combat Operations In April 2006, CJTF-76 launched Operation Mountain Lion, a search and secure operation performed by the Afghan National Army and 10th Mountain Division in Marawara District of Kunar Province, Afghanistan. During Operation Mountain Lamb, the 10th Mountain Division Civil Affairs operation, assisted humanitarian and educational efforts throughout Afghanistan. Operation Mountain Thrust was a major operation directed against Taliban insurgents in eastern and southeastern Afghanistan from May to August 2006. In September 2006, Afghan and Coalition forces began the maneuver phase of Operation Mountain Fury focusing on defeating Taliban resistance in Ghazni, Khost, Logar, Paktika, and Paktia provinces. Operation Mountain Fury is just one part of a series of coordinated operations placing continuous pressure on Taliban extremists across multiple regions of Afghanistan in order to provide security to the population, extend the government to the people, and to increase reconstruction. In November 2006, CJTF-76 launch Operation Mountain Eagle to defeat enemy forces and link governors of Afghanistan to district level. Paramount to the success of CJTF-76 during OEF VII was the execution of an aggressive non-lethal effects campaign designed to influence and educate the world, harass the enemy, and win the hearts and minds of Afghanistan's center of gravity ‚Äì its populace. CJTF-76 leaders spent tireless hours engaging Afghan civic leaders at all levels to ensure that positive messages resonated throughout the Afghan public, as well as in the media. Campaign emphasis included the vital importance of extending government capacity, promoting reconstruction, creating employment opportunities and working to improve Afghan National Security Forces. Noteworthy accomplishments included the construction and improvement of several Provincial Coordination Centers, Provincial Development Councils and District Centers. More than 500 kilometers of roads, schools, clinics and other long lasting projects were built at a cost of just over $90 million using Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) funds.

CJTF-82 operations included lethal and non-lethal missions. Operations Furious Pursuit, Finite Pursuit, and Kulang Hellion were conducted by 1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment focused coalition forces in the Helmand Province. Operation Maiwand (see Human Terrain System) brought coalitions forces with the 203rd Corps (Afghanistan) to perform Counter-insurgency operations in Ghazni province. Operation Deh Yak focused efforts in Ghazni towards the refurbishment of local schools, medical supply support and several other civic actions. During Operation Kyber, Task Force Fury (1st Battalion, 508th Prachute Infantry Regiment) fell under the operational control of the 203rd ANA Corps in a large scale sweep of Paktya Province. This shaped operations such as Operation Big Axe conducted by Task Force Spartan (3rd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division) and Operation Rock Avalanche conducted by Task Force Rock (503rd Infantry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team kept the enemy off balance and set the stage for follow on operations. CJTF-82 conducted over 325 conventional operations. The statistics do not state the countless Key Leader Engagements, Shura's and other interactions with the Afghan population that soldiers of CJTF-82 performed. Their ability to successfully carry the fight to the enemy while simultaneously building trust with the local population and overseeing non-conventional missions that has allowed the government of Afghanistan and its security forces the opportunity to develop its influence and capabilities.

In joint cooperation, these Coalition Forces achieved unprecedented success as they worked together to secure the citizenry (Security), exercise capable governance (Governance), and develop a sustainable economy (Development), while defeating terrorists and insurgents, in order to extend (GIRoA) authority and influence as the legitimate government of the Afghan people. Major Combat Operations Joint, Coalition, and Alliance Forces made significant advances on numerous fronts to include historic trilateral cooperation between US, Pakistan, and Afghan Forces that enabled significant operations focused upon border development. COIN capabilities in RC-E were enhanced through an increase in Forces with the Polish Battle Group assumption of battle control of Task Force White Eagle and the introduction of the US 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division as Task Force Spartan. A singularly significant operation with long-term strategic implications saw Joint, Coalition, and Alliance Forces join to provide effective, comprehensive security across Afghanistan, ensuring successful voter registration to set conditions for the 2009 Afghan presidential election. In the largest transformational initiative in the history of OEF, CJTF-101 planned, coordinated, and initiated support preparations for the introduction of over 21,000 US Troops into Regional Command South. Simultaneously, the CJTF-101 staff planned, coordinated, and executed the transfer of U.S. National Command, National Support, and Title X responsibilities to the newly formed United States Forces ‚Äì Afghanistan Headquarters in Kabul.

Their mission called for Regional Command East, in close coordination with the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA), joint, interagency, and multinational partners, to conduct counter-insurgency (COIN) operations from April to October 2009, in order to improve GIRoA's capacity to provide security, exercise good governance, develop a sustainable licit economy, and improve the quality of life for the Afghan people. Major Combat Operations CJTF-82's mission was to support the GIRoA in rebuilding the country's social institutions including governance, security, economics, and infrastructure while defeating an insurgency committed to hindering regional stability. With more the 24,600 servicemen and woman assigned and attached throughout the deployment, CJTF-82 personnel provided critical mission support for filed forces that include: 3 infantry brigade combat teams, a combat aviation brigade, on Polish Brigade, a Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, a Military Police Brigade, an Engineer Brigade Headquarters, 12 Provincial Reconstruction Team's, and six Agriculture Development Teams operating in an area of 31,000 square miles, of which over 90% is not accessible by vehicle. CJTF-82 partnered with NATO and ISAF from over 30 countries, fielding forces that implement the 'hands-on' actions to develop a stable and secure environment for ordinary Afghan citizens to prosper economically and improve quality of life. Major Units Involved: *Afghan National Army *82nd Airborne Division *Combat Aviation Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division (United States) *48th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States) *4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Mountain Warriors), 4th Infantry Division (United States) = Operation Enduring Freedom XI ‚Äì Combined Joint Task Force 101, June 2010 to May 2011 = Command and Control 101st Airborne Division From June 2010 to May 2011, CJTF-101, in support of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA), NATO, ISAF, and other joint interagency, and multinational organizations, conduction population-centric, comprehensive counterinsurgency operations focused on key terrain to neutralize the insurgency, increase the competency and credibility of Afghan institutions, and facilitate development to set the security and stability conditions to begin transition to GIRoA. Major Combat Operations During OEF XI, CJTF-101 countered the insurgency along major transportation and economic corridors. These efforts provided freedom of movement to key road networks and set the conditions for enhanced economic development. The task force also assisted several provinces with transition to full GIRoA governance. CJTF-101 conducted more than 770 named operations. The task force, in cooperation with its Afghan and Pakistan partners, provided development and security to the Afghan-Pakistani border. Further, CJTF-101 worked with the Afghan National Army, the Afghan National Police, and other Afghan Security Forces to enhance the safety and security in and around Kabul. The task forced helped GIRoA set the conditions for successful 2010 Afghan parliamentary election, even while assisting its Pakistan neighbors with the disastrous 2010 Pakistan floods. Midway through its campaign, CJTF-101 welcomed an additional brigade into its ranks. This increased combat power and enabled the task force to intensify counterinsurgency and nation-building operations, thus ensuring successful winter and spring campaigns. Thanks to the efforts of the men and women in CJTF-101, the task force had an overwhelmingly successful year.

Together, the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and Coalition Forces achieved unprecedented success as they worked to secure the population, expand and exercise governance, and develop a sustainable economy. The ANSF increased capability to a record level, defeating terrorist and insurgents while building a capable government of the Afghan people. Major Combat Operations During OEF XIII, CJTF-1 and the ANSF, expanded the security in Regional Command East through joint cooperation, continually expanding infrastructure, developing transportation and economic corridors through freedom of movement, and expanding the development and capabilities of the Afghan National Army, Afghan Local Police, Afghan National Police, Afghan Uniform Police, and Afghan Border Police.

At the time of his death, he was Chairman & CEO of Investment firm Romulus Asset Management and a Senior Associate at the Harvard University John F. Kennedy School of Government, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Maugeri sat on the Energy Advisory Board of Accenture. He previously sat on the boards of Saipem, and Polimeri Europa. Maugeri was a Visiting Scholar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), as well as a member of the Institute's Energy Advisory Board. He also served as an International Counselor of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS ‚Äì Washington, DC). Eni Maugeri became Eni‚Äôs youngest director in 2000, when at 36 he was named Director of Strategy and Development (2000-2010). In 2010 Maugeri was named Executive Chairman of Polimeri Europa (formerly known as Enimont and currently renamed Versalis), the company managing Eni‚Äôs petrochemical activities (2010-2011). The appointment of Maugeri as Eni‚Äôs head of strategy coincided with the development of aggressive plans for growth that resulted in the period of greatest development for the company: from 2000 to 2005 Eni increased its hydrocarbons production by 50 per cent while corporate profits reached their highest level in history. In 2007 Maugeri launched a new strategy for renewable energy. He engineered the relaunch of the historic Istituto Donegani (a research center), with a new focus on renewable energy and a strategic alliance between Eni and MIT - concluded by Maugeri with the current U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz. During his chairmanship of Polimeri Europa Maugeri conceived and engineered (in association with Novamont) the largest green chemistry project in the world ‚Äì the industrial reconversion of the Porto Torres site. Whereas Eni‚Äôs petrochemical activities had been operating at a loss for several decades (‚Ç¨630 mln and ‚Ç¨ 513 in 2008 and 2009 respectively), Maugeri‚Äôs strategy of radical discontinuity allowed it to obtain a modest but significant positive cash flow from operating activities (‚Ç¨ 25 mln in 2011, with losses cut to ‚Ç¨ 71 mln). Writings Maugeri‚Äôs views and predictions have been expressed in a series of articles for several major international newspapers and magazines ‚Äì including The New York Times, International Herald Tribune (currently International New York Times), Foreign Affairs, Newsweek, Science, Scientific American, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and The National Interest. In particular, Maugeri is one of the leading supporters of the view according to which the world does not run the risk of running out of oil (See: ‚ÄúNot in Oil‚Äôs Name‚Äù ‚Äì Foreign Affairs, July‚ÄìAugust 2003 ‚Äì and ‚ÄúOil, Never Cry Wolf: Why the Petroleum Age is Far from Over‚Äù ‚Äì Science, 21‚Äì27 May 2004), and for this reason he has been attacked on many occasions by proponents of the ‚Äúpeak oil‚Äù thesis . In his book The Age of Oil: the Mythology, History, and Future of the World‚Äôs Most Controversial Resource (Praeger, 2006) Maugeri predicted an imminent collapse of oil prices, which occurred in the second half of 2008. In the same book he predicted the development of unconventional oil and gas resources thanks to the advent of new technologies ‚Äì including hydraulic fracturing. In Beyond the Age of Oil: The Myths, Realities, and Future of Fossil Fuels and Their Alternatives (Praeger, 2010) Maugeri argues that by 2020 a technological breakthrough will shake the solar industry and permanently alter the energy landscape. Two essays published by Maugeri during his stay at Harvard have sparked a heated debate at the international level. In these essays, Maugeri argues that the incessant growth of global oil production capacity is generally underestimated, and this ‚Äì combined with modest growth in oil demand ‚Äì could lead to an oil price collapse in the course of this decade. The second of these studies ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Shale Oil Boom: A U.S. Phenomenon‚Äù (2013), based on an unprecedented analysis of 4,000 shale oil wells, concludes that the United States could become the world's biggest oil producer by 2017. At the same time, however, the study indicates that the shale oil and gas revolution will not be replicable in the rest of the world ‚Äì let alone in Europe ‚Äì due to the high drilling intensity required.

History Stanley Furniture was founded in April 1924 by Thomas Bahnson Stanley, who later became Governor of Virginia. Stanley learned the furniture business from his father-in-law, John D. Bassett, who had founded and owned Bassett Furniture in Bassett, Virginia. Stanley located his new company near Bassett, and the community it was in was soon named Stanleytown. =Early years= In early 1924, Thomas B. Stanley resigned from his position at Basset Furniture in order to start his own company, Stanley Furniture. He founded the company in his home county of Henry County, Virginia and brought on his nephew, Fred A. Stanley, and his brother, John W. Stanley, as some of the company's first employees. While building the first Stanley Furniture factory, Stanley decided to build a company town along with it. With that plan, Stanleytown, Virginia was developed. Over 100 homes were built to house the new factory's workers, and new roadways were paved. Rent for the new homes was $4-$5 per month. Stanley Furniture's first furniture collection, a dining room suite, debuted in 1925 and consisted of a buffet, china closet, server, table and chairs. The success of this first collection ushered in a time of prosperity for the company. Profits steadily rose from 1925 through 1928, and in 1929 the company decided to double its production capacity to meet growing demands. When the Wall Street Crash of 1929 hit, Stanley Furniture was in debt from the recent expansion. In order to keep the company alive, the 400 Stanley employees accepted a pay cut and agreed to work ten hours of time for nine hours of pay. Stanley himself accepted a pay cut of 125%. To compensate for this lack of income, Stanley lowered rents by 20% in Stanleytown. Due to these changes, the company was able to operate through the Great Depression and maintain a narrow profit margin. =1930s-1950s= Following the Great Depression, Stanley Furniture experienced continued growth. The company's growth through the 30s, 40s and 50s led to the decision to complete a second expansion. This time around, the goal of the expansion was not only to meet new demands, but also to modernize the production facilities by increasing automation in the factory. The expansion cost a total of $4 million and was completed in 1957. It was also during this time period that the company's founder, Thomas B. Stanley, was elected to serve as Governor of Virginia, an office he held from 1954-1958. =1960s-1980s= The Mead Corporation purchased Stanley Furniture in 1969 and maintained ownership of the company for 10 years. In 1979, Stanley Furniture became part of several leveraged buyouts until, finally, in the late 1980s, Stanley Furniture reemerged as a wholly owned, private entity. In 1988, Albert Prillaman was named chairman, CEO and president of Stanley Furniture. =1990s-early 2000s= At the end of 1992, Stanley Furniture underwent a financial restructuring and entered into an initial public offering on December 18, 1992. By July 1993, 1.7 million shares of common stock were sold and Stanley Furniture was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol STLY. In 1994, Stanley entered into the upholstered furniture business after focusing on non-upholstered, wood residential furniture for most of its sixty-year history. The company came out with a Norman Rockwell-inspired collection during this period that was well-received. The collection incorporated 21 of Rockwell's magazine covers into the pieces themselves and sold not just the furniture but also the fabric from the collection for the first time in the company's history. Despite the success of the Rockwell collection, Stanley Furniture phased out their upholstered furniture business in 1998 and refocused on wood furniture. With its focus solely on wood furniture, Stanley opened a new, 300,000-square-foot facility in Martinsville, Virginia in March 2000. In late 2003, Stanley Furniture joined Vaughan- Bassett Furniture, Bassett Furniture and 20 other furniture manufacturers in filing an anti-dumping petition with the U.S. Government. The petition was intended to aid the companies in collecting duties against Chinese furniture manufacturers they suspected were selling products in the U.S. for less than fair value. Through a series of investigations, the Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission determined that the claims were valid under the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000, and all 23 U.S.-based furniture manufacturers received monetary compensation funded by duties placed on Chinese furniture manufacturers. Stanley received the largest disbursement. Recent history In 2009, Stanley announced that the manufacturing of its \\"Young America\\" line of furniture would be moved to the United States, primarily its North Carolina and Virginia factories. This same year, R. Glenn Prillaman took the reins as president and CEO of the company. In 2010, the firm announced that it would close its Stanleytown manufacturing operation, laying off 530 workers and converting the former factory into a warehouse and distribution center. Over the next few years, this facility was phased out as well and was soon shuttered. In 2012, Stanley announced it was relocating its headquarters to High Point, NC. In April 2014, the company announced it would close its Robbinsville, North Carolina plant, laying off 400 workers; the closure was in spite of the $9 million it had recently invested in the plant when the company had moved manufacturing of its \\"Young America\\" furniture line from China to Robbinsville. In November 2017, after years of struggling to return to profitability, Stanley Furniture agreed to be sold to Churchill Downs, LLC, a private Vietnamese industry group. Shortly after the sale was announced, Glenn Prillaman resigned from his role as CEO and President. Prillaman was replaced on an interim basis by Matt Smith, managing director of the Finley Group. In March 2018, the sale to Churchill Downs, LLC was finalized making Walter Blocker the company's new owner. Blocker serves as chairman of the Vietnam Trade Alliance based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Following completion of the sale, Richard Ledger was named as CEO and Adam Tilley was named as president. Both Ledger and Tilley previously worked for Stanley as VP of Operations and VP of Product, respectively.

The two best established biomonitoring programs in representative samples of the general population are those of the United States and Germany, although population-based programs exist in a few other countries. In 2001, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began to publish its biennial National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals, which reports a statistically representative sample of the U.S. population. Definition Biomonitoring involves the use of organisms to assess environmental contamination, such as of surrounding air or water. It can be done qualitatively by observing and noting changes in organisms, or quantitatively by measuring accumulation of chemicals in organism tissues. By observing or measuring the effects the environment has on its resident organisms, pollution may be suspected or inferred. Overview Historically, public health regulations have been based on theoretical risk calculations according to known levels of chemical substances in air, water, soil, food, other consumer products and other sources of potential exposure. Human biomonitoring offers the opportunity to analyze the actual internal levels of bodily substances from all potential routes of exposure at one time, which may contribute to improving risk assessments. Scientific advancements have made it possible to detect a greater number of chemical substances in smaller concentrations in the body, with some chemicals detectable at levels as low as parts per trillion. A single biomonitoring measurement is only one snapshot in time and may not accurately reflect the level of exposure over longer periods. In 2006 the U.S. National Research Council published a report, Human Biomonitoring for Environmental Chemicals. The report recognized the value of biomonitoring for better understanding exposure to environmental chemicals, and included several findings and recommendations to improve the utility of biomonitoring data for health risk assessment. In summary, the report called for more rigorous health-based criteria for selecting chemicals to include in biomonitoring studies; the development of tools and techniques to improve risk-based interpretation and communication of biomonitoring data; integration of biomonitoring into exposure assessment and epidemiological research; and exploration of bioethical issues around biomonitoring, including informed consent, confidentiality of results, and others. The issue of exposure to environmental chemicals has received attention as a result of televised reports by Bill Moyers for PBS and Anderson Cooper for CNN's \\"Planet in Peril\\" series. The book Our Stolen Future, with a foreword by former Vice President Al Gore, also raised awareness by focusing on endocrine disruption. Surveys in the U.S. *In the United States, the CDC first tested samples from the general population for lead and a few pesticides in 1976. In the late 1990s, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) program had a major expansion. *National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals The CDC's Division of Laboratory Sciences within the National Center for Environmental Health has developed a National Biomonitoring Program, and has published the biennial National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals since 2001. As the selection of chemicals is controversial, the CDC has identified influential criteria:Evidence of exposure in a U.S. population, presence and significance of health effects after a given level of exposure, desire to track public health initiatives to reduce exposure to a given agent, existing method for accurately measuring biologically relevant concentrations of the chemical, sufficient tissue specimens, in particular, blood and/or urine samples and cost-effectiveness. CDC established three criteria for removing chemicals from future surveys: a new replacement chemical (i.e., a metabolite or other chemical) is more representative of exposure than the chemical currently measured, or if after three survey periods, detection rates for all chemicals within a method-related group are less than 5 percent for all population subgroups (i.e., two sexes, three race/ethnicity groups, and the age groups used in the National Report), or if after three survey periods, levels of chemicals within a method-related group are unchanged or declining in all demographic subgroups documented in the National Report. * The National Children's Study plans to follow 100,000 children across the United States from birth until age 21. The study was authorized as part of the Children's Health Act of 2000 as the largest effort undertaken to address the effects of social, economic and environmental factors on a child's health. the CDC's Environmental Health Laboratory announced in 2009 it would play a key role in the biomonitoring of the ongoing National Children's Study. In collaboration with the National Institute of Child Health and Development, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. *Some U.S. states have received federal support and established biomonitoring programs. In 2001, the CDC awarded planning grants to 33 states to assist in capacity building for expanding biomonitoring. The California Environmental Contaminant Biomonitoring Program (CECBP) was established by law in 2006 and is administered by the California Department of Public Health. Minnesota's Biomonitoring Pilot Program was established by law in 2007 and is run by the Minnesota Department of Health. Surveys in Germany The German Environmental Survey (GerES) has been performed since 1985, and in 1992 the Human Biomonitoring Commission of the German Federal Environment Agency was established. Surveys in Canada Statistics Canada administers the Canadian Health Measures Survey, which includes biomonitoring for environmental chemicals. Health Canada administers a program called Mother- Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals, which focuses on 2,000 pregnant women and their infants. Methods and chemicals Chemicals and their metabolites can be detected in a variety of biological substances such as blood, urine, hair, semen, breast milk, or saliva. Breast milk is a favored matrix (substance) to measure lipophilic (fat-loving) persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) compounds during lactation; this exposure route is dominant for breastfeeding children. A lipophilic compound might also be detected in blood, while a hydrophilic (water-loving) compound might be detected in urine. Analytical methods used by the CDC include isotope dilution mass spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, or graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Some of the detected chemicals include: *Methylmercury *Lead *Mercury *Aflatoxin *Antimony *Arsenic *Benzene *Benzidine *Bromochloromethane *Cadmium *Cobalt *Formaldehyde *Perchlorate *Persistent organic pollutants Dioxins Furans Organochlorine pesticides *DDT and DDE Perfluorinated compounds *Bisphenol A (BPA) *Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) *Polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) *Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) *Phthalates *Pyrethroids *Pyrethrin *Oxybenzone (Benzophenone-3) *Styrene *Toluene *Thallium *Trichloroethylene *Triclosan *Tungsten *Vinyl chloride Interpretation The presence of an environmental chemical in the body does not necessarily indicate harm. The analytical chemistry of detecting chemicals has advanced more rapidly than the ability to interpret the potential health consequences. Health risks are usually established from toxicity studies in laboratory animals and epidemiological evidence in humans. Lead is a well studied chemical with a CDC action level of concern, currently at 10 ¬µg/dL, or 100 parts per billion, in blood; however, neurobehavioral impairment has been noted below this level.Lead (Pb) Toxicity: What Are the U.S. Standards for Lead Levels? ATSDR. Because this approach requires establishment of cause and effect in epidemiological studies and a thorough understanding of human dose response, data to support these types of action levels exist for only a few environmental chemicals. The concept of Biomonitoring Equivalents (BEs) has been developed as an alternative approach to aid in interpreting and communicating biomonitoring results in the context of potential risks to health. Surveys of human exposure to chemicals do not usually integrate the number of chemical compounds detected per person and the concentration of each compound. This leaves untested relevant exposure situations; e.g., whether individuals with low concentrations of some compounds have high concentrations of the other compounds. Analyses of the concentrations of a given compound usually show that most citizens have much lower concentrations than a certain minority. A study based on a representative sample of the population of Catalonia (Spain), which integrated the number of compounds detected per person and the concentration of each compound, found that more than half of the population had concentrations in the top quartile of 1 or more of the 19 persistent toxic substances (PTS) (pesticides, PCBs) analyzed. Significant subgroups of the population accumulated PTS mixtures at high concentrations. For instance, 48% of women 60‚Äì74 years had concentrations of 6 or more PTS in the top quartile; half of the entire population had levels of 1 to 5 PTS above 500 ng/g, and less than 4% of citizens had all PTS in the lowest quartile. Thus, PTS concentrations appear low in most of the population only when each individual compound is looked at separately. It is not accurate to state that most of the population has low concentrations of PTS. The assessment of mixture effects must address the fact that most individuals are contaminated by PTS mixtures made of compounds at both low and high concentrations. Biomonitoring equivalents Scientists performing biomonitoring testing are able to detect and measure concentrations of natural and manmade chemicals in human blood and urine samples at parts-per-billion to parts-per-quadrillion levels. A 2006 U.S. National Research Council report found that while scientists were capable of detecting the chemicals at these levels, methods for interpreting and communicating what their presence meant regarding potential health risks to an individual or population were still lacking. The report recommended that scientific research be done to improve the interpretation and communication of biomonitoring results through the use of existing risk assessments of specific chemicals. To address this situation, several groups recognized that exposure guidance values, such as reference dose and tolerable daily intake, could, with sufficient data, be translated into corresponding estimates of biomarker concentrations for use in the interpretation of biomonitoring data. In 2007, the initial methodology for the systematic translation of exposure guidance values into corresponding screening values for biomonitoring data, dubbed Biomonitoring Equivalents, was published by scientists from Summit Toxicology. Subsequently, an expert panel from government, industry and academia, convened to develop detailed guidelines for deriving and communicating these Biomonitoring Equivalents. Biomonitoring Equivalents can be used for evaluation of biomonitoring data in a risk assessment context. Comparing biomonitoring data for a chemical with its Biomonitoring Equivalent provides a means for assessing whether population exposures to chemicals are within or above the levels considered safe by regulatory agencies. Biomonitoring Equivalents can thus assist scientists and risk managers in the prioritization of chemicals for follow-up or risk management activities. Since 2007, scientists have derived and published Biomonitoring Equivalents for more than 110 chemicals, including cadmium, benzene, chloroform, arsenic, toluene, methylene chloride, triclosan, dioxins, volatile organic compounds, and others. Several have been developed through collaborations of scientists from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, CDC and Health Canada. Researchers from the German Human Biomonitoring Commission have also proposed a concept for deriving screening values similar to Biomonitoring Equivalents. Communication The National Research Council's 2006 report emphasized that accurate communication of results is essential for the proper use of biomonitoring surveys, but at the same time noted \\"there is no accepted standard for good biomonitoring communications.\\" In 2007, the Boston University School of Public Health organized a panel on this topic. An expert panel on Biomonitoring Equivalents has published guidelines for communicating information to the general public and health care providers. Charles McKay of the Connecticut Poison Control Center is interviewed in a video titled \\"A Medical Doctor's Perspective on Biomonitoring\\", which is focused on helping the general public better understand biomonitoring.

As Blackshear is deep in southeast Georgia in a pine forest, it was thought to be a safe place for this relocation. The new prison was simply an open camp in a remote place, surrounded by a guardline, including some heavy artillery pieces. During the month of November in 1864, some 5,000 Union soldiers began arriving at Blackshear. The first shipment of 600 prisoners arrived by the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad on November 16 from Savannah. Within a few weeks, the population had swelled to nearly 5,000. As Sherman approached the coastline, most of the prisoners were further evacuated to Charleston, South Carolina and other places. By December, the \\"corral\\" at Blackshear was empty of Union prisoners. Approximately 27 Union soldiers were buried in Blackshear until the close of the war, when they were reinterred at Beaufort National Cemetery, Beaufort, South Carolina. Their names are unknown.

The result was a United Nations Command victory. The battle, along with the Third Battle of Wonju, has been called \\"the Gettysburg of the Korean War,\\" and represents the \\"high-water mark\\" of the Chinese invasion of South Korea. Due to the ferocity of the Chinese attack and the heroism of the defenders, the battle has also been called \\"one of the greatest regimental defense actions in military history.\\" Background After Chinese forces entered Korea in November 1950, the UN forces, uncertain about the intentions and combat capabilities of the Chinese, drew back behind the 38th parallel and waited to see what the Chinese would do. Plans were even made for complete withdrawal from the peninsula. In this climate of general uncertainty, Lt. General Matthew B. Ridgway decided to make a stand at Chipyong-ni and also at Wonju. He recognized that the Chinese had overstretched their supply lines, and would not be able to keep up their advance much longer. He intended to use the 23rd RCT to blunt the Chinese attack so that the Eighth Army could carry out a counterattack before the Chinese had a chance to consolidate their forces. Prelude Following the Battle of the Twin Tunnels on 1 February 1951, the 23rd Regimental Combat Team under the command of Paul L. Freeman, Jr. reached the important crossroads town of Chipyong-ni on 3 February and immediately set up a perimeter defense. Over the next few days, they dug in and were reinforced by artillery, tank, and engineer elements. By February 13, their strength consisted of three infantry battalions; the French Infantry Battalion and First Ranger Company, both attached to the regiment; the 37th Field Artillery Battalion; Battery B, 82nd Antiaircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion; Battery B, 503rd Field Artillery Battalion; Company B, 2nd Engineer Battalion (Combat); elements of the 2nd Signal Co. (attached); and a platoon from the 2nd Medical Battalion. In all, Freeman had 4,500 men under his command, including 2,500 front-line infantrymen. On February 11, the Chinese attacked X Corps at Hoengsong as part of their Fourth Phase Offensive, driving back two divisions and leaving the 23rd Regiment at Chipyong-ni behind enemy lines and exposed to a Chinese attack. The Chinese then sent the entirety of the 39th Army, and divisions of the 40th and 42nd armies to encircle and destroy Chipyong-ni. On the morning of the 13th, after a patrol revealed a significant Chinese presence on Route 24 to the north of the town, Lt. General Edward Almond, commander of X Corps ordered the 23rd Regiment to withdraw to the Yoju area, to the south, due to concerns that it would be encircled by Chinese forces. However, later on the same day, Ridgeway reversed this decision after meeting with his superior, Douglas MacArthur. He insisted on attempting to hold Chipyong-ni, and directed Almond to attack north in order to relieve the regiment if it was cut off. Informed of this, Freeman began to bulk up his defenses, and requested resupply by air and airstrikes for the 14th. He deployed his 1st Battalion to the northern part of the perimeter, the 2nd to the south, and the 3rd on the east, with the French on the western side. The 1st Battalion's Company B and the Rangers were kept in reserve behind the 1st Battalion line. Battle =Day 1= During the afternoon of the 13th, the Chinese forces took up positions around the 23rd's perimeter, but any attempts to advance were stopped by artillery. The U.S. forces observed heavy flare activity throughout the afternoon. Early in the evening, Freeman gathered his unit commanders and told them to expect an attack during the night. Between 22:00 and 23:00 hours, the Chinese directed small arms and mortar fire at the Americans from the northwest, north, and southeast. C Company, positioned near Route 24 on the northern perimeter, was hit hardest. Slightly after 23:00, Chinese infantrymen moved down hill 397, attacking E and G Companies. They were driven off, but shortly before 24:00 hours, an intense mortar and artillery barrage hit C Company. After this, the defenders heard bugles, whistles, and bells, followed by a concerted infantry attack all along the perimeter. By midnight, only 3rd Battalion in the east was not engaged. The attack was fierce but brief, intended to probe the US defenses, ending in most places soon after midnight. It was followed by an assault on 1st Battalion at 01:00, but when this was repulsed the Chinese forces dug in beneath the 1st Battalion positions. At 00:15, a bloody assault was made from the east against K Company. The attack was fought off, but the shooting remained fierce enough that no ambulance could get through to evacuate K Company's wounded. In the north, the French were attacked from hill 345. C Company was forced to withdraw slightly, but it counterattacked and its positions were regained. G Company was attacked at 02:30 and 04:00. During the 04:00 attack, it was in danger of being overwhelmed, so a regimental tank was dispatched for support. At 05:30, the attacks began to let up. There was still fighting in the west and east, however. At first light the Chinese renewed their attack in the west, against the 3rd Battalion. However, as daylight approached the Chinese knew they would be vulnerable to Air Force strikes; at 07:30 a Chinese bugler blew a call to withdraw. A US Army artist's illustration of the battle. =Day 2= At dawn on the 14th, Freeman had sustained about 100 casualties and been hit in the leg by mortar fire himself. He retained command despite his injuries. Air support kept the Chinese away during the daylight hours of the 14th, but the Americans were running dangerously low on ammunition. At dusk, artillery fire began to come down on the perimeter, followed soon after by infantry assaults. The 3rd Battalion was hit hard, and mortar fire rained down on the regimental command post for an hour. At midnight the main assault began, with a Chinese wave attack striking A Company, then veering over towards C Company and the French. By 01:30, K Company in the east had been assaulted twice, and everywhere the ammunition shortage was critical. Air Force planes dropped ammunition down to the soldiers, but many of them were shot when they tried to get to it. Throughout the night, C-47 Skytrain transports dropped flares to provide illumination. At 02:30, I Company's perimeter was penetrated, the first successful penetration of the battle. Units of I Company, however, supported by L Company and the machine-gunners of M Company, counterattacked and restored the perimeter. Fighting was fiercest, however, in the south, where at around 03:15, Chinese forces broke through the perimeter and forced the defenders out of their positions, a serious threat to the beleaguered regiment. At daybreak on the 15th, Freeman ordered the Ranger company, a platoon from F Company, and 14 men from G Company to counterattack, but they were driven back at 06:15 after sustaining heavy casualties in hand-to-hand fighting. At noon on the 15th, B Company, in full view of the Chinese and across open ground, attacked once more but this time was pinned down by Chinese machine guns. By 12:30, it was still 9,000 yards from what remained of the earlier counterattack. In desperation, the regiment sent out four tanks under Captain Perry Sager to attempt to flank the Chinese. Right about this time, at 15:45, units of the 5th Cavalry Regiment (Task Force Crombez) moved out from a town to the south to support the men at Chipyong-ni. At 14:00, the Chinese retreated from their position inside the perimeter under the pressure of an Air Force napalm bombardment and an attack by B Company, in which they lost 50% of their men. When they gained the position at 16:30, they could see Task Force Crombez in the distance, which arrived at 17:25 with nearly 20 tanks. The Chinese withdrew. =The Chinese perspective= Although most western historians claimed that there were over 20,000 Chinese soldiers participating in this battle, the Chinese military record showed only eight Chinese infantry regiments (around 8,000 men) in this region with few heavy weapons, including the 343rd Regiment, 344th Regiment (both from the 115th Division, 39th Army), 356th Regiment, 357th Regiment (both from the 119th Division, 40th Army), 359th Regiment (from the 120 Division, 40th Army), 375th Regiment (from the 125th Division, 42nd Army), 376th Regiment and 377th Regiment (both from the 126 Division, 42nd Army). According to the memoir of Xu Guofu, the commander of the 119th Division and also the field commander of the Chinese forces at Chipyong-ni, five Chinese infantry regiments were deployed to attack the UN troops in this area by Deng Hua, the third commander and commissar of the Chinese People Volunteer Army. However, two regiments (343rd & 376th) lost their ways in dark and went to wrong places. Due to poor communications, only three regiments (356th, 357th, and 359th) around 3,000 soldiers, were actually committed in the attack on Chipyong-ni. After a bloody fight overnight, in the morning of 15 February, Xu's troops broke through the perimeter and expected to launch another attack when night came again. But Xu received an order from Wen Yucheng, commander of the 40th Army, to withdraw as the Chinese discovered that there were over 6,000 UN troops in Chipyong-ni instead of the initial estimate of 1,000 men. Xu also insisted that the West overestimated Chinese casualties. According to him, casualties of the three Chinese regiments committed in the attack were a little over 900 killed and wounded, of which one third were killed (Xu does not give figures for non-combat casualties or prisoners). Aftermath French veterans of the battle in Chipyong-ni received flags from Korean soldiers on a victory ceremony in 2012. Casualties on the UN side of the conflict were 51 killed, 250 wounded, and 42 missing. The Chinese lost approximately 1,000 killed and 2,000 wounded. The battle offered an incredible boost to the morale of Eighth Army, which had up until now seen the Chinese as an invincible juggernaut. Soon afterwards, Operation Killer was launched, followed by Operation Ripper. The Chinese, who had hopes of driving the UN forces to the sea, were themselves driven back. Eventually, this led to the start of peace negotiations in July 1951. Matthew Ridgway, speaking to Congress in May 1952, said of the battle: The Chinese leadership, in a critique of the battle, stated that =Awards= On February 20, Sergeant First Class William S. Sitman, a machine gun section leader in M Company, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for bravery during the battle when he threw himself on a grenade to save five of his comrades. After the battle, the 23rd RCT and all attached units were awarded the United States Army Distinguished Unit Citation.

It was founded in 1969 by Chester and Luba Kuc and named after the Cheremosh River that separates the historic regions of Bukovyna and Galicia in Ukraine.Cheremosh Ukrainian Dance Company Since 1991 Cheremosh has been under the direction of Artistic Director and Ballet Master Mykola Kanevets. Cheremosh has toured throughout Canada, the United States, Scotland, China, and most recently, a 15-day tour across four Australian cities.  History  The Cheremosh Ukrainian Dance Company of Edmonton, Alberta, was founded in 1969 by Chester and Luba Kuc. The group began with just 19 dancers, and since then has grown to include four performing groups, a School of Dance and over 100 dancers at the various levels. Named after the Cheremosh River that separates the regions of Bukovyna and Halychyna in Ukraine, the company easily matches the river's boisterousness and vivacity. As Cheremosh's first Artistic Director, Chester Kuc's goal was to modernize Ukrainian folk dance by attempting to convey certain truths about the Ukrainian people. Using dance to make these truths dramatic and effective, he brought his dances to the stage in order to entertain audiences and further the growth of the rich Ukrainian culture in Canada. Since its inception, Cheremosh has had five artistic directors. Following Chester Kuc, Richard Wacko, Ken Kachmar and Greg Bayda, respectively, led Cheremosh between the years of 1982 and 1991. Currently, all performing groups train under Artistic Director and Ballet Master Mykola Kanevets, whose distinctive choreography and meticulous instruction have helped the Cheremosh Ukrainian Dance Company and its affiliates maintain a strong reputation as a successful and accomplished Ukrainian dance organization.

A number of Pogo's works consist almost entirely of the sounds he samples, with few or no additional music or sound samples. Music Nick Bertke, under his band name Pogo, has produced tracks using samples from films and TV shows such as Pulp Fiction. He has also sampled from other sources, such as field recordings for his project Remix the World. Remix the World was an ambitious project, consisting of all original content. Bertke shot real world footage and then used those sounds and images to capture the essence of the places he visited. The Real World Remix was shot in Kenya, South Africa, Bhutan, and Perth (AU). Bertke is best known for his use of video sampling to produce music videos, which he uploads on the video-sharing website YouTube. As of October 2017, his most popular YouTube video is Alice, made of samples of Disney's animated film Alice in Wonderland, with more than 20 million views. In 2010, his music video Gardyn, created from footage of his mother working in her garden, was juried along with 24 other YouTube videos for an exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City. On 29 September 2016, Pogo released a song called \\"Trumpular\\" on SoundCloud which consisted of quotes from Republican nominee, and later President, Donald Trump. Later, in 2019, he made a music video called \\"Homarge\\", based on The Simpsons (mostly from the episode \\"Simpson and Delilah\\"), which gained over a million views. Pogo's music is used on the conservative YouTube talk show Louder with Crowder, hosted by Steven Crowder. Various music of his is used coming back from commercial breaks. Personal life On his September 2011 US tour, Bertke was arrested and taken into custody for three weeks due to the lack of a proper work visa, and is prohibited from re-entering the United States until 2021. In January 2020, Pogo's YouTube channel was hacked and hijacked by an unknown user, who renamed the channel \\"Ethereum 2.0 Foundation\\" and deleted all the videos on the channel. The hacker then started a scam livestream promoting Ethereum cryptocurrency, and claiming that any amount of crypto sent to them during the stream would be multiplied and sent back. Pogo took to Twitter to let fans know that he was aware of the hack and has contacted YouTube for help. The hacked channel was terminated by YouTube on January 17https://www.reddit.com/r/Pogo/comments/epp8xv/channel_gone_now/, and Pogo remained without a channel for four days while fans created accounts hosting temporary re-uploads of his videos and music. On January 22, YouTube restored the account, including his view counts, subscribers, and comments sections. Controversies Bertke was criticized for a 2015 video that derided feminists as gold diggers and \\"making misogynist arguments against women's rights.\\" He later claimed that it was made \\"to impersonate the radical right\\". In a YouTube livestream that was uploaded in 2016, Bertke stated that he has a \\"fairly robust resentment of the gay community\\". In the same video and on the topic of the Orlando nightclub shooting, a terrorist attack at a gay bar in Florida in 2016, he said, \\"It amazes me to see the West welcoming a culture through the floodgates that wants gays dead. I think that's fantastic\\". Bertke later claimed to have not any hate for the gay community and also claimed Asperger syndrome and bipolar disorder as contributing factors. He stated that the video was made in bad taste and that he never intended for it to go public, although he also stated that he was trying to \\"impersonate the far-right and create hysteria\\", noting that the video was made around the time of the 2016 American election. YourEDM compared his \\"homophobic rhetoric\\" to the 2015 video, which he similarly tried to explain as a social experiment. Writing for The Verge, Megan Farokhmanesh saw this explanation as a transparent attempt at plausible deniability.

Niha ( ) is a village in the Bekaa Valley about north of Zahl√©. It is famous for its Roman archeological ruins, and in particular two lower Roman temples that date back to the 1st century AD. Etymology The name Niha is used by four Lebanese towns or villages: Niha, Zahl√© in the Bekaa; Niha, Batroun; Niha, Tyre and Niha, Chouf. The word neeha is Syriac and denotes to the place the character of calm, peaceful Geography and climate Niha The village is located about 65 km east of the Lebanese capital Beirut off the main road that leads to Baalbeck. It is 8 km north of Zahl√© and nearly 2 km north-east of the town of Ablah. The village sits in a small canyon at an average altitude of 1,100 m (3,600 ft). It is surrounded by fast rising hills with vertical drops of 150 m (500 ft). The canyon narrows and rises to the back country of Niha also known as the \\"Hosn\\" (in Arabic, hosn means fortress) at an approximate elevation of 1,350 m (4,400 ft). The mountains continue to rise over some ten kilometers to reach the top of Mount Sannine at 2,628 m (8,622 ft). Niha is bordered to the west by the high rising mountains of Mount Lebanon and the peak of Mount Sannine, to the north by the village of Tamnine, to the south by the villages of Nabi Ayla (Arabic: ŸÜÿ®Ÿä ÿ£ŸäŸÑÿß) and Forzol (Arabic: ÿ£ŸÑŸÅÿ±ÿ≤ŸÑ), and to the east by Ablah and the fertile plains of the Bekaa. Niha's climate is arid and temperate. Temperatures average 27 C (80 F) in the dry summer season, with occasional heat waves that can reach 40 C (105 F). Winters are cool and tend to be wet. Annual rain fall is approximately 500 mm (20 in) and snow fall can reach 1 m (3 ft). Winter temperatures average 5 C (40 F) but occasionally dip to -10 C (15 F).http://www.fao.org/sd/climagrimed/pdf/ws01_24.pdf The landscape at the lower elevation appears from a distance bleached as limestone is dominant in the soil. Red soil mixed with limestone make the ground fertile for agriculture which dominates the economy of the village (and that of the Bekaa valley). The temperate and dry climate, and high elevation make the village suitable to grow a variety of fruits. Grapevines, cherry, almond and apple orchards dot the terraced hills. The village as well as the rest of the Bekaa produce the bulk of the fruits in Lebanon and export significant volumes to the Arab countries. A panorama photograph of Niha, Zahle. The Lower Great Temple in the village is barely visible to the far left (1). The red roof of the church of the Prophet Elias is seen about a quarter of the photograph from the left (2). The old Roman quarries can be seen in the distance (3) on the way to the Hosn of Niha. Rayak and the Bekaa plain are to the far right (4). Some of the village's vineyards are also visible (5). Niha gets its primary water from underground water tables as well as several springs in the hills above the village. The snow melt filtered through the limestone gives the water an appealing freshness with a light taste of calcite. A new wastewater treatment plant was planned to be established in 2009 with the assistance of USAID for the villages of Niha, Ablah and Nabi Ayla. History While there are no records of the original date of the establishment of the village, its history largely follows the history of Lebanon marked by various invading armies over several millennia, and by the feudal system that was the norm during the Ottoman occupation.Kamal Salibi, \\"The Modern History of Lebanon,\\" (Introduction) Caravan Books, 1977 The Bekaa Valley was a Byzantine stronghold until the Islamic conquest. After the arrival of Islam, many parts of Mount Lebanon, notably the Keserwan, were inhabited by a Shiite population that enjoyed the patronage of the Fatimids. With the arrival of the Crusades and the Mamluks during the 12th and 13th centuries, the Shiites fled to the Bekaa where they remain today especially in the northern parts (notably the Baalbeck region). With the arrival of the Ottomans in the 16th century, the Bekaa region was made part of the vilayet of Damascus. The 19th century witnessed the migration of Christian families from Mount Lebanon (notably Keserwan and Matn regions) to the Bekaa. Spotty records indicate that an agreement was forged in the 19th century between the Shiite and Christian clans to exchange territories. The Christians of Tamnine exchanged lands with the Shiite inhabitants of Niha, the result of which Tamnine became a majority Shiite village, and Niha became a majority Christian village. Archeology The Lower Small Temple A portion of the text in this section is courtesy of the Ministry of Tourism of Lebanon,destinationlebanon.com which provided the bulk of the description on the Roman temples of Niha. Niha is home to four Roman temples that were constructed between the 1st and 3rd century AD. The Lower two temples are located on the edge of the village, and the upper two temples are about 2 km above the village in what is known as \\"Hosn\\" Niha. The first and smallest temple was built in the 1st century AD. As one enters the gate at the edge of the village into the archeological park that is maintained by the Department of Antiquities, the Lower Small Temple appears first and directly ahead to the right of the creek. The temple was dedicated to the Syro- Phoenician mermaid goddess Atargatis and her consort, the god Hadaranes.The Roman Near East: 31 BC-AD 337 (Carl Newell Jackson Lectures) Harvard University Press (March 15, 1995) p. 282 Hadaranes is the local name of Hadad, the god of thunder, lightning and rain. Atargatis is the goddess of fertility. A small water channel runs through the podium of the temple leading to the belief that water purification rituals were conducted at the temple. The entrance of the temple faces south; it consists of a stairway leading to a portico with four columns with Ionic-style capitals. The cella, or central space of the temple, is accessed through three doors at the top of the stairway, and the restricted adytum is accessed by a stairway of nine steps at the end of the cella. The statue of the god or goddess was located inside the adytum and was usually not accessible to the public. In addition to the water channel running through and around the podium, there is also a smaller water channel that runs from the base of the statue of the god or goddess in the adytum down to the center of the cella. In the remains of this temple, archaeologists discovered a stone with an inscription mentioning a ‚Äúfemale virgin prophet‚Äù named Hochmea. Hochmea was the priestess of Hadaranes and Atargatis; she dedicated herself to those two gods and cut herself off from the world. The stone inscription says: \\"According to an order from the god, she stopped eating bread for 20 years and lived for 100 years.\\" This stone was removed by archaeologists and is no longer located at the temple site. This small temple was apparently used for the public cult, which allowed everyone to participate in purification rituals. The statue of the priest at the entrance of the Lower Great Temple Opposite the creek lies the Great Temple which was extensively restored by the government of Lebanon in the 1950s. Towering nearly 20 m (65 ft), the temple was built during the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD and was apparently used for a mysterious cult that spread during that era, similar to the temple of Bacchus in Baalbeck. The temple was also dedicated to the god Hadaranes and goddess Atargatis, as well as to a young god who played the role of their son. The entrance of the temple faces east; it is built over a large podium and accessed through a three-part stairway leading to a portico with four columns with Corinthian-style capitals. To the left of the stairway, a carved relief depicts a priest with two icons on his chest, representing a god and a goddess. He is wearing a hat with a crescent carved on it, and he holds a floral water sprinkler in his left hand and a cup in his right hand, which pours holy water onto a small altar. The lintel of the gigantic temple door has an eagle with spread wings carved on it. This eagle is similar to the one carved on the lintel of the temple of Bacchus in Baalbeck. However, the Niha carving is slightly different, because the eagle holds a floral crown in one of its talons and a palm leaf in the other. To the right side of the lintel, a carved relief represents a winged naked boy holding a palm leaf in his left hand. Next to the boy is a carving of a winged goddess of victory holding a palm leaf in her left hand and a crown in her right hand, raising the crown towards the head of the boy. The left side of the lintel has a carved relief representing the same goddess of victory with the same items in her hands. The carvings appear to be linked to the mysterious rituals that were performed inside the temple. These rituals were related to the issues of birth, growth, death, and the hope of an afterlife. The inside of the Great Temple consists of two parts: the cella, where the people used to gather, and the elevated adytum, which was accessed by a stairway. The adytum used to hold the statue of the god or goddess. Under the elevated adytum is a crypt, which held the items used during the ceremonies and rituals of the temple. The doorway leading to the crypt is decorated with a carved relief representing a priest pouring holy water over an altar. Next to him, a woman holds an undefined object in her right hand. To the left, the relief represents a winged boy riding over a sheep or a bull. The Upper Great Roman Temple in the Hosn of Niha The Small Temple of Niha is oriented north- south, while the Great Temple is oriented east-west. During the excavations of the site, an oratory was discovered in front of the Small Temple. The oratory had an altar representing the goddess of Niha, surrounded by a number of steles sculpted in the local style (not Roman style). The reason for the perpendicular orientation of the two temples is the presence of this monumental altar, which was situated in front of the Small Temple, and which was used as a base for the orientation of the Great Temple. Two other Upper Roman temples were constructed at the Hosn, approximately 2 km away from the two temples mentioned earlier. Located at an elevation of 1,400 m (4,600 ft) with difficult road access, these two temples are not restored. Architectural evidence at the site indicates that it was transformed into a small fort during the medieval period (hence the name of Hosn). Built on a podium facing toward the east, the Upper Great Temple is composed of a portico with four columns, leading to a cella, and then to an elevated adytum. Today, the temple site is reasonably well preserved ‚Äì most of its walls are intact, but its columns are no longer standing. The altar in front of the temple was destroyed by a Byzantine Basilica that was built over it. The Basilica has three naves and a semi-circular apse to its east end. The lower portions of the Basilica walls remain visible today. The second Small Temple opens to the south and was accessed through a stairway that is almost completely destroyed today. The stairway leads to a portico with two columns, and then to a small cella with a small niche at its end, which used to hold the statue of the god or goddess. Modern population Church of the Prophet Elias It is common in Lebanon that all voters return to their claimed village of ancestry for suffrage regardless of their place of residence in the country. The municipality of Niha states there are 1,260 registered voters in the village, and approximately 1,000 permanent residents in the village. Of the more than 2,000 individuals who claim Niha as their hometown but reside elsewhere, nearly 400 reside outside Lebanon. The summer population swells considerably as vacationers with family ties to the village flock to the village from the Lebanese coastline or abroad (including the United States, Canada, European Union, Brazil, Argentina or Australia). The population is made of several family surnames, most notably Maalouf (ŸÖÿπŸÑŸàŸÅ), Ayoub (ÿ£ŸäŸàÿ®), Rmeily (ÿ±ŸÖŸäŸÑŸä), Fakhry (ŸÅÿÆÿ±Ÿä), Hrawi (Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸàŸä), Najjar (ŸÜÿ¨ÿßÿ±), Kerbaje (ŸÉÿ±ÿ®ÿßÿ¨), Rabbah (ÿ±ÿ®ÿßÿ≠), Abu Deyye (ÿßÿ®Ÿà ÿØŸäŸá), Harb (ÿ≠ÿ±ÿ®), Ghanem (ÿ∫ÿßŸÜŸÖ), Ziadeh (ÿ≤ŸäÿßÿØÿ©), Allam (ÿπŸÑÿßŸÖ), and Sharafeddine (ÿ¥ÿ±ŸÅ ÿ£ŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ). The families live together in peace and harmony, and provide each other with assistance characteristic of tightly-knit village societies. The village population is vastly Christian, split between the Maronite Christians and Greek Orthodox Christians, with a few families that follow Shia Islam. All faiths have peacefully coexisted in the village without a record of violent incidents due to religious differences. The Church of the Prophet Elias (Arabic: ŸÖÿßÿ± ÿ•ŸÑŸäÿßÿ≥) was built c. 1880 and serves the villagers of the Greek Orthodox faith. The Church of Saint Antonios (Arabic: ŸÖÿßÿ± ÿ£ŸÜÿ∑ŸàŸÜŸäŸàÿ≥) serves the Maronites in the village. Until the 1960s, the population dressed in traditional Lebanese costumes, notably the male sherwal garment characterized by baggy pants and headdresses, or the gambaz, a long gown worn by both sexes. As the population modernized and education became widespread, western dresses became the norm. Traditional dresses are only worn today during celebratory festivities. The primary economic engine of the village is agriculture. The village produce includes grapes, apples, cherries, almonds, that are then transported to Zahl√©, Beirut or exported to Arab countries. Albeit modern amenities such as telephones are now available in the village, the residents continue to live by century-old practices such as storing food supplies for the winter season. During the summer, villagers are seen busy preparing Kishk (Arabic: ŸÉÿ¥ŸÉ) a specialty powdery dish made from cracked wheat and yogurt. Arak (Arabic: ÿπÿ±ŸÇ) is also one of the specialties of the village especially using locally grown grapes. Whereas illiteracy was common at the beginning of the 20th century, the literacy rate today is very high, and likely higher than the average literacy rate in Lebanon. The village is home to a secondary education school ( ÿ´ÿßŸÜŸàŸäÿ© ŸÜŸäÿ≠ÿß) and boasts a high concentration of college graduates including medical doctors, engineers, scientists and teachers. Musical events The village municipality along with the Ministry of Tourism sponsor the annual International Festival of Music in Niha,see for example http://www.resonnance.org/pdf/affiche_4concerti_liban_2009.pdf covering classical Western and Arabic music.

This initiative was criticized by Gregg Rickman, her predecessor in the George W. Bush Administration. During her work, Rosenthal and her staff overcame bureaucratic obstacles to establish a mandatory 90-minute course on antisemitism at the Foreign Service Institute, which is the training school for diplomats, along with a 341-word definition of antisemitism, which includes newer forms of antisemitism, including Holocaust denial. The United States State Department human rights reports have been reporting anti-Semitism with more frequency, which Rosenthal has been praised, and she said that \\"our reporting has improved many times over ‚Äî 300 percent in the three years I‚Äôve been here.\\" Rosenthal has met with a number of foreign officials regarding antisemitism. She met with Ilmar Reepalu in April 2012, the then mayor of Malm√∂, Sweden to discuss claims about rise in antisemitism in the city. Reepalu has been criticized for his comments about antisemitism and Jews but he has responded by saying that \\"antisemitism is an abomination\\" and that Jews in Malm√∂ have nothing to do with Israel's actions and should not be called to account for that. After the meeting, Rosenthal said that Reepalu's language is antisemitic. Rosenthal also met with the Swedish Minister for Integration, Erik Ullenhag. Ullenhag released a statement after the meeting, saying that Reepalu's comments \\"obstructs the fight against antisemitism\\". Rosenthal has also confronted Saudi Arabian officials regarding antisemitism in their textbooks and has requested that Jordanian officials teach about the Holocaust in their schools, which they refuse to do. Political controversies Rosenthal was criticized by ADL president Abraham Foxman in an open letter, for saying that the speakers of the Israel solidarity rally \\"espoused narrow, ultra-conservative views of what it means to be pro-Israel\\".An Open Letter To Hannah Rosenthal, by Abraham Foxman. The list of speakers included Harry Reid, Dick Gephardt, and Natan Sharansky. In response to Foxman's letter, in an interview to The Tablet Magazine, Rosenthal said \\"I have worked with Abe in the past and I consider Abe a friend of mine\\" and that \\"we mostly agree\\". Foxman was supportive of Rosenthal's appointment; in a statement issued by the Anti-Defamation League, Foxman wrote: \\"We look forward to working with Hannah Rosenthal [...]\\" Foxman has also criticized Rosenthal for organizing and accompanying a trip by eight American imams and Muslim leaders to the Dachau and Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camps, saying that the involvement of the State Department in an intercommunal affair was unwarranted. He explained that \\"having Muslims speaking out about anti- Semitism, that's our job\\" and not that of the State Department. However, since then, Foxman and Rosenthal settled their differences, and Foxman has praised Rosenthal for her work, as well as for establishing a mandatory course on antisemitism for diplomats. In December 2009 Rosenthal criticized Israel's ambassador to the United States Michael Oren for his \\"most unfortunate\\" remarks regarding J Street, namely, that they support positions that \\"impair Israel‚Äôs interest\\" and that they are \\"fooling around with the lives of 7 million people.\\"U.S. official blasts Israel envoy's 'unfortunate' J-Street remarks, Haaretz, 24 December 2009.

She worked for about 40 years as a nanny, mostly in Chicago's North Shore, while pursuing photography. She took more than 150,000 photographs during her lifetime, primarily of the people and architecture of Chicago, New York City, and Los Angeles, although she also traveled and photographed worldwide. During her lifetime, Maier's photographs were unknown and unpublished; many of her negatives were never printed. A Chicago collector, John Maloof, acquired some of Maier's photos in 2007, while two other Chicago-based collectors, Ron Slattery and Randy Prow, also found some of Maier's prints and negatives in her boxes and suitcases around the same time. Maier's photographs were first published on the Internet in July 2008, by Slattery, but the work received little response.Slattery, Ron. (July 2008) \\"Story\\", in Big Happy Fun House. Retrieved on January 11, 2011. In October 2009, Maloof linked his blog to a selection of Maier's photographs on the image-sharing website Flickr, and the results went viral, with thousands of people expressing interest. Maier's work subsequently attracted critical acclaim,\\"Vivian Maier\\", Chicago Tonight, broadcast by WTTW, December 22, 2010. Retrieved on January 4, 2011 and since then, Maier's photographs have been exhibited around the world. Her life and work have been the subject of books and documentary films, including the film Finding Vivian Maier (2013), which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 87th Academy Awards.  Personal life  Many details of Maier's life remain unknown. She was born in New York City in 1926, the daughter of a French mother, Maria Jaussaud Justin, and an Austrian father, Charles Maier (also known as Wilhelm). Several times during her childhood she moved between the U.S. and France, living with her mother in the Alpine village of Saint- Bonnet-en-Champsaur near her mother's relatives. Her father seems to have left the family temporarily for unknown reasons by 1930. In the 1930 Census, the head of the household was listed as Jeanne Bertrand, a successful photographer who knew Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, founder of the Whitney Museum of American Art. When Maier was 4, she and her mother moved to the Bronx with Bertrand, who at the time was a professional photographer. In 1935, Vivian and her mother were living in Saint-Julien-en-Champsaur; three years later, they returned to New York. In the 1940 Census, Charles, Maria, Vivian and Charles Jr were listed as living in New York, where the father worked as a steam engineer.United States Federal Census 1940; New York, New York; Roll: T627_2653; Page: 8A; Enumeration District: 31-1242. In 1951, aged 25, Maier moved from France to New York, where she worked in a sweatshop. She moved to the Chicago's North Shore area in 1956, where she worked primarily as a nanny and carer for the next 40 years. In her first 17 years in Chicago, Maier worked as a nanny for two families: the Gensburgs from 1956 to 1972, and the Raymonds from 1967 to 1973. Lane Gensburg later said of Maier, \\"She was like a real, live Mary Poppins,\\" and said she never talked down to kids and was determined to show them the world outside their affluent suburb.Cahan, Vivian Maier: Out of the Shadows, pp. 86‚Äì87 The families who employed her described her as very private and reported that she spent her days off walking the streets of Chicago and taking photographs, usually with a Rolleiflex camera.Houlihan, Mary (January 2, 2011). A developing picture: The story of Vivian Maier , The Chicago Sun-Times. Retrieved on January 4, 2011. John Maloof, curator of some of Maier's photographs, summarized the way the children she nannied would later describe her: In 1959 and 1960, Maier embarked on a solo trip around the world, where she took pictures in Los Angeles, Manila, Bangkok, Shanghai, Beijing, India, Syria, Egypt and Italy. The trip was probably financed by the sale of a family farm in Saint-Julien- en-Champsaur. For a brief period in the 1970s, Maier worked as a housekeeper for talk-show host Phil Donahue. She kept her belongings at her employers'; at one residence, she had 200 boxes of materials. Most were photographs or negatives, but Maier also collected newspapers; in at least one instance, it involved \\"shoulder-high piles.\\" She also recorded audiotapes of conversations she had with people she photographed.Lane, Anthony, \\"Candid Camera: 'Finding Vivian Maier' and 'The French Minister,'\\" New Yorker, March 31, 2014, p. 80-81 In the documentary films Finding Vivian Maier (2013) and Vivian Maier: Who Took Nanny's Pictures / The Vivian Maier Mystery (2013), interviews with Maier's employers and their children suggest that Maier presented herself to others in multiple ways, with various accents, names, life details, and that with some children, she had been inspiring and positive, while with others she could be frightening and abusive. The Gensburg brothers, whom Maier had looked after as children, tried to help her as she became destitute in old age. When she was about to be evicted from a cheap apartment in the suburb of Cicero, the Gensburg brothers arranged for her to live in a better apartment on Sheridan Road in the Rogers Park area of Chicago. In November 2008, Maier fell on the ice and hit her head. She was taken to a hospital but failed to recover. In January 2009, she was transported to a nursing home in the Chicago suburbs, where she died on April 21, 2009.Cahan, Vivien Maier: Out of the Shadows, 2012, p. 263 Discovery and recognition In 2007, two years before she died, Maier failed to keep up payments on storage space she had rented on Chicago's North Side. As a result, her negatives, prints, audio recordings, and 8 mm film were auctioned. Three photo collectors bought parts of her work: John Maloof, Ron Slattery and Randy Prow.Cahan, Vivien Maier: Out of the Shadows, 2012, p.283 Maier's photographs were first published on the internet in July 2008 by Slattery, but the work received little response. Maloof had bought the largest part of Maier's work, about 30,000 negatives, because he was working on a book about the history of the Chicago neighborhood of Portage Park.Newsletter January 2009 ‚Äì Number IX, Jefferson Park Historical Society. p. 2. \\"... we celebrated the publishing of a new book, 'Portage Park', authored by JPHS executive board members Dan Pogorzelski and John Maloof.\\" Maloof later bought more of Maier's photographs from another buyer at the same auction. Maloof discovered Maier's name in his boxes but was unable to discover anything about her until a Google search led him to Maier's death notice in the Chicago Tribune in April 2009. In October 2009, Maloof linked his blog to a selection of Maier's photographs on Flickr; they became a viral phenomenon, with thousands of people expressing interest. In early 2010, Chicago art collector Jeffrey Goldstein acquired a portion of the Maier collection from Prow, one of the original buyers. Since Goldstein's original purchase, his collection has grown to include 17,500 negatives, 2,000 prints, 30 homemade movies, and numerous slides. In December 2014, Goldstein sold his collection of B&W; negatives to Stephen Bulger Gallery, Toronto. Maloof, who runs the Maloof Collection, now owns around 90% of Maier's total output, including 100,000 to 150,000 negatives, more than 3,000 vintage prints, hundreds of rolls of film, home movies, audio tape interviews, and ephemera including cameras and paperwork, which he claims represents roughly 90 percent of her known work. Since her posthumous discovery, Maier's photographs, and their discovery, have received international attention in mainstream media,Profetico, Cecilia (October 22, 2009).\\"Tras una subasta, encuentran 40.000 negativos escondidos en un mueble\\", Clar√≠n (Buenos Aires) in Spanish; Thor√©n, Line (November 9, 2009).\\"Heml√∂s fotograf sl√•r igenom ‚Äì efter sin d√∂d\\", Aftonbladet (Stockholm) in Swedish. Retrieved on January 4, 2011. and her work has appeared in gallery exhibitions, several books, and documentary films. =Legal challenge= In June 2014, lawyer and former photographer David C. Deal filed a legal case challenging the rights of current owners of Maier's negatives to commercialize them. The case sought to establish whether there is a legal heir to Maier's estate ‚Äì a cousin in France ‚Äì who should be recognized under American law. Under copyright law in the US, owning a photograph is distinct from owning copyright and the case may take several years to resolve, particularly since the potential heirs to the estate live outside the US. Maloof, who owns the majority of Maier's known photographs, had previously tracked down a first cousin once removed in France and paid him for the rights; however, Deal believes he has found a closer relative in France who may be the estate's beneficiary.Meisner, Jason, 2015,\\"Artist Challenges County on Vivian Maier's Estate\\", Chicago Tribune, 14 May, p. 6.  Photography  Artist and photography critic Allan Sekula has suggested that the fact that Maier spent much of her early life in France sharpened her visual appreciation of American cities and society. Sekula compared her work with the photography of Swiss-born Robert Frank: \\"I find myself imagining her as a female Robert Frank, without a Guggenheim grant, unknown and working as a nanny to get by. I also think she showed the world of women and children in a way that is pretty much unprecedented.\\"Cahan, Vivien Maier: Out of the Shadows, 2012, pp. 40‚Äì41 Maloof has said of her work: \\"Elderly folk congregating in Chicago's Old Polish Downtown, garishly dressed dowagers, and the urban African-American experience were all fair game for Maier's lens.\\" Photographer Mary Ellen Mark has compared her work to that of Helen Levitt, Robert Frank, Lisette Model, and Diane Arbus. Joel Meyerowitz, also a street photographer, has said that Maier's work was \\"suffused with the kind of human understanding, warmth and playfulness that proves she was 'a real shooter'.\\" '' Maier's best-known photographs depict street scenes in Chicago and New York during the 1950s and 1960s. A critic in The Independent wrote that \\"the well-to-do shoppers of Chicago stroll and gossip in all their department-store finery before Maier, but the most arresting subjects are those people on the margins of successful, rich America in the 1950s and 1960s: the kids, the black maids, the bums flaked out on shop stoops.\\"\\"Little Miss Big Shot\\", The Independent (November 1, 2009). Retrieved on January 4, 2011. Most of Maier's photographs are black and white, and many are casual shots of passers-by caught in transient moments \\"that nonetheless possess an underlying gravity and emotion\\". In 1952 she purchased her first Rolleiflex camera. Over the course of her career she used Rolleiflex 3.5T, Rolleiflex 3.5F, Rolleiflex 2.8C, Rolleiflex Automat and others. She later also used a Leica IIIc, an Ihagee Exakta, a Zeiss Contarex and various other SLR cameras. Writing in The Wall Street Journal, William Meyers notes that because Maier used a medium-format Rolleiflex, rather than a 35mm camera, her pictures have more detail than those of most street photographers. He writes that her work brings to mind the photographs of Harry Callahan, Garry Winogrand, and Weegee, as well as Robert Frank. He also notes that there are a high number of self-portraits in her work, \\"in many ingenious permutations, as if she were checking on her own identity or interpolating herself into the environment. A shadowy character, she often photographed her own shadow, possibly as a way of being there and simultaneously not quite there.\\" Roberta Smith, writing in The New York Times, has drawn attention to how Maier's photographs are reminiscent of many famous 20th-century photographers, and yet have an aesthetic of their own. She writes that Maier's work \\"may add to the history of 20th-century street photography by summing it up with an almost encyclopedic thoroughness, veering close to just about every well-known photographer you can think of, including Weegee, Robert Frank and Richard Avedon, and then sliding off in another direction. Yet they maintain a distinctive element of calm, a clarity of composition and a gentleness characterized by a lack of sudden movement or extreme emotion.\\" In the documentary film Finding Vivian Maier (2013), the grown-up children whom Maier had cared for in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s recall how she combined her work as a photographer with her day job as a nanny. She would frequently take the young children in her care with her into the center of Chicago when she took her photographs. Occasionally they accompanied her to the rougher, run-down areas of Chicago, and, on one occasion, the stock yards, where there were bodies of dead sheep. In the late 1970s, Maier stopped using her Rolleiflex. Most of her photographs taken in the 1980s and 1990s were color transparencies, taken on Ektachrome film.Cahan, Vivien Maier: Out of the Shadows, 2012, p. 262  Legacy  In the 2014 to 2015 school year at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Vivian Maier Scholarship Fund was established to provide opportunity to female students with need for additional financial resources. The scholarship was endowed through donations by Maloof, Siskel and Howard Greenberg, the owner of Howard Greenberg Gallery which exhibits and deals her work. Maloof used the funds received from print sales and his film Finding Vivian Maier to help create the scholarship with the intention for it to be permanent and offered on a yearly basis. With no application process, the money will be awarded to students not based on degree, enrollment year, or medium they are working within, allowing artistic freedom to the recipients. The names of recipients have not been publicly released. Archives In 2017, the University of Chicago Library announced that a research collection of Maier images was donated by Maloof.

It discusses philosophical Cynicism and popular cynicism as a societal phenomenon in European history.  Content  In the first volume of Critique of Cynical Reason, Sloterdijk discusses his philosophical premises. The second volume builds on these premises to construct a phenomenology of action that incorporates the many facets of cynicism as they appear in various forms of public discourse. In both volumes, the relationship between texts and images is an integral part of the philosophical discussion. Repeatedly, Sloterdijk points to the etymological consonant shift from the \\"K\\" of the Greek term kunikos to the \\"C\\" of the modern cynic as support for his thesis: The original Greek school of philosophy established itself as a subversion of the Ancient Greek Academy and as an outlet for the powerless general populace, whereas the Modern industrial and contemporary post- industrial system degrades the concept so it applies primarily to mercantile exchanges of tradable goods, including ideas. One illustration that Sloterdijk employs to make this point is the activity of agents and double-agents, which to him incorporates contemporary cynicism as an incarnation of tactical thinking, pragmatic maneuvering, silencing, and misspeaking. A true Enlightenment in the spirit of Immanuel Kant's essays What is Enlightenment? and Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch never has existed, Sloterdijk concludes. Sloterdijk describes the evolution of middle and upper-class consciousness by employing negative examples, which he draws from European history and from the history of education. He describes World War II as a first climax of a \\"system of hollowing out the self\\" (namely, capitalism) that, \\"armed to the teeth, wants to live forever.\\" Sloterdijk's analysis of Dadaism as artists practiced it in Berlin accompanies his disclosing of the variations of irony and sarcasm that all the political camps of the time between the two World Wars employed (especially Dadaists, Social Democrats, National Socialists, Communists in their derisive attempts to incite their supporters against those of all other points of view). He analyzes Nazi texts that - Sloterdijk claims - intend to \\"rhetorically rescue\\" the Third Reich, and sets them against the \\"humanist authors\\" of the time, like Erich K√§stner and Erich Maria Remarque, who - he says - stood in the midst of \\"a rancorous war of all against all.\\" Passages from the works of these authors, Sloterdijk reveals, clearly point to the cynical atmosphere of their time, and take analyzable, predictable forms that can be fruitfully scrutinized. Additionally, Sloterdijk attempts to trace the Reception History of Kant's three Critiques and their various interpretations up to contemporary times. He attempts to show that Kant's \\"critical trade\\" became instrumentalized via the premise of Francis Bacon's aphorism that \\"knowledge is power,\\" and was finally subverted and neutered by it. Moreover, he uses the ancient Greek Cynicism as a foil for the contemporary, inhumane cynicism that evolved, so Sloterdijk claims, through a combination of middle-class semiologies and grand philosophical ambitions. Sloterdijk concludes that, unlike the ancient Greek version, Cynicism no longer stands for values of the natural and ethical kind that bind people beyond their religious and economically useful convictions. Rather, it has become a mode of thought that defines its actions in terms of a \\"final end\\" of a purely materialistic sort and reduces the \\"ought\\" to an economic strategy aimed at maximizing profit. This contemporary sort of Cynicism remains silent, however, when it comes to social, anthropogenous, and altruistic goals having to do with the \\"in\\" and \\"for\\" of the \\"good life\\" the original Cynics were seeking. In the final chapter, Sloterdijk points out that he regards a \\"good life\\" not simply as an external fact, but as a \\"being embedded\\" in a \\"Whole\\" that constantly reorganizes itself and renews itself, and that human kind creates out of its own understanding and motivations. He concludes with a precise analysis of Martin Heidegger's magnum opus Being and Time and seeks out clarifications regarding particular acts of creating, especially as they apply to the events and the artistic activity of the time between the two World Wars. 1983 non-fiction books Books by Peter Sloterdijk German non-fiction books Philosophy books Cynicism Contemporary philosophical literature Phenomenology literature ","title":"Critique of Cynical Reason"},{"id":"25059415","title":"Miracle Wood Stakes top three finishers"},{"id":"25059429","text":"Crime Investigation Australia was an Australian true-crime series that first premiered on Foxtel's Crime & Investigation Network in August 2005.Foxtel details programs for Summer and beyond knowfirst.info Retrieved 26 September 2009.

Lapchick is a human rights activist and writer.Richard Lapchick, Biography, (http://www.ncasports.org/about/staff-bios/bio-richard- lapchick.shtml) accessed November 12, 2009.  Early years  Lapchick's life passion was sparked in Germany at the age of 14 while touring the Nazi internment camps of Dachau. He was in Europe during the 1960 Summer Olympic Games and discovered the impact sport has to cross all lines, color, creed and religion and his dream to use sport as a vehicle for social change was born. It reinforced his early experiences witnessing public hostility toward his father Joe Lapchick when, as the Coach of the New York Knicks, he signed Nat \\"Sweetwater\\" Clifton, the first African-American player signed in the NBA in 1950.Richard Lapchick, Smashing Barriers, (Lanham, MD: Madison Books, 2001), 103-4. His earliest memory as a five-year-old was seeing an image of his father swinging from a tree across the street from his house where people were picketing against the inclusion of a black athlete in a \\"white\\" team.  Activist work  In the 1970s, Lapchick started fighting apartheid and led the boycott of the South African participation in international sport events, the Davis Cup in particular.Richard Lapchick, Smashing Barriers, (Lanham, MD: Madison Books, 2001), 3-5. Lapchick was physically attacked in his college office in February 1978 just as it looked like the Davis Cup was going to be cancelled. He was attacked by men who proceeded to carve the N-word into his stomachhttps://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/guest-commentary/os-op-richard- lapchick-protests-racism-hope-20200607-ksvar6dhkng7zg7inewbgrd2ni-story.html. Lapchick worked for the United Nations from 1978-1984. His New York City apartment was ransacked in 1981 while he was leading a protest of a South African rugby team scheduled to play in the United States. His activism led to a personal invitation from Nelson Mandela upon his presidential inauguration in 1994 after anti-apartheid movements were successful. Lapchick founded the Center for the Study of Sport in Society (CSSS) in 1984 at Northeastern University and is now Director Emeritus.http://www.northeastern.edu/sportinsociety/about/index.html In 1993, Lapchick co-founded the Mentors in Violence Prevention program. One year after the Center's inception, Lapchick wanted to take its mission national and established the National Consortium for Academics and Sports (NCAS). For 32 years, the NCAS has been \\"creating a better society by focusing on educational attainment and using the power and appeal of sport to positively affect social change.\\" Lapchick helped create the National Student-Athlete Day in 1988 which to date has recognized more than 2.6 million high school students for being citizen-scholar-student-athletes. Lapchick was engaged by the NBA in 2014 to help construct the case for why continued ownership of the Los Angeles Clippers by Donald Sterling was determined to the NBA after his racist remarks became public. Lapchick is active in work against human trafficking and has added Shut-Out Trafficking to the NCAS's effort to combat human trafficking with week-long programs on NCAS campuses. Since 2014-15 there have been week- long programs on 28 NCAS campuses connecting with more than 54,570 participants. The program is partnered with the US Fund for UNICEF and the USOC Athletes Advisory Council and is funded by the Fetzer Institute.  Academic career  Lapchick was an Associate Professor of Political Science at Virginia Wesleyan College from 1970-1978 and a Senior Liaison Officer at the United Nations between 1978-1984. He then served as director at Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society for 17 years. Lapchick accepted the endowed chair of the DeVos Sport Business Management Program at the University of Central Florida's College of Business Administration in 2001. In 2009 it was named the #1 MBA program in the nation for volunteer service. In 2015, Sport Business International named DeVos as one of the top three graduate sport business programs in the United States as well as one of the top five graduate sport business management programs internationally. During his time at DeVos, Lapchick was named as \\"One of the 100 Most Powerful People in Sport\\". While at the University of Central Florida, he remains President of the National Consortium for Academics and Sports (NCAS) and has established The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES) which serves as a comprehensive resource for issues related to gender and race in amateur, collegiate and professional sports. He is the author of the Racial and Gender Report Card (RGRC) published by TIDES. In December 2006, Lapchick, his wife Anne, daughter Emily, and a group of DeVos students formed the Hope for Stanley Foundation (HFS), which has worked to help rebuild in New Orleans. HFS has also worked with tornado victims in Tuscaloosa, AL, in New York with the victims of Hurricane Sandy, and in Baton Rouge, LA with victims of the flooding that impacted the community in August 2016.  Awards  In 2009, the Rainbow/ PUSH Coalition and Rev. Jesse Jackson honored him for \\"lifetime achievement in working for civil rights.\\" Lifelong friend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar presented the award to Lapchick on behalf of Rev. Jackson.

The skirmish was the first armed conflict of the First Opium War and occurred when British boats opened fire on Chinese war junks enforcing a food sales embargo on the British community. The ban was ordered after a Chinese man died in a drunken brawl with British sailors at Tsim Sha Tsui. The Chinese authorities did not consider the punishment to be sufficient as meted out by British officials, so they suspended food supplies in an attempt to force the British to turn over the culprit. Captain Charles Elliot was the chief superintendent of British trade in China, and he sailed to Kowloon in the cutter Louisa for food supplies during the embargo, accompanied by the schooner Pearl and a pinnace from HMS Volage. They encountered three Chinese junks, and Elliot sent interpreter Karl Gutzlaff with demands to allow the supply of provisions. He finally delivered an ultimatum after several hours of correspondence: the junks would be sunk if supplies were not received. The stated time period expired with no results, so the British opened fire on the junks, which returned fire with support from the on-shore fort. The larger junks pursued the British boats which were sailing away after running low on ammunition, but the British re-engaged the ships after replenishing their ammunition, and the Chinese retreated to their former position, ending the clash in a stalemate.  Background  On 7 July, seamen from the Carnatic and Mangalore, both owned by Jardine, Matheson & Co., landed in Kowloon where they were joined by colleagues from other British and American ships. After a group of sailors consumed the rice liquor known as samshu, an innocent local named Lin Weixi in the village of Tsim Sha Tsui was beaten in a brawl by these drunken sailors and died the next day.Hoe & Roebuck 1999, p. 91Hanes & Sanello 2002, p. 61Fay 1975, p. 171 On 15 July, Chief Superintendent of British Trade in China, Charles Elliot, offered rewards of $200 for evidence leading to the conviction of those responsible for the murder and $100 for evidence leading to the instigators of the riot. He also gave $1,500 in compensation to Lin's family, $400 to protect them against extortion of that money from what he called the \\"lower mandarins\\", and $100 to be distributed among the villagers.Correspondence Relating to China 1840, p. 432 Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu demanded the handover of the culprit by the British authority, which was refused by Ellliot. On 12 August, under an Act of Parliament of 1833, Elliot began a Court of Criminal and Admiralty Jurisdiction on board the Fort William in Hong Kong harbour, with himself as judge and a group of merchants as the jury.Hoe & Roebuck 1999, p. 92 Two men were found guilty of rioting, fined ¬£15 each, and sentenced to three months hard labour to be served in England while a further three men were found guilty of assault and rioting, fined ¬£25 each, and sentenced to six months imprisonment in similar conditions.Correspondence Relating to China 1840, p. 433 However, the Act was under review and after arriving in England, they were set free on the grounds that the trial held no jurisdiction. Elliot invited Lin to send observers to the trial, but none came.Hanes & Sanello 2002, p. 62 Without the handover of a man to the Chinese, Lin was not satisfied with the proceedings. He viewed the extraterritorial court as an infringement of China's sovereignty. On 15 August, Lin issued an edict that prevented the sale of food to the British.The Chinese Repository, vol. 8, p. 216 Chinese labourers working for the British in Macao were withdrawn the next day. War junks arrived in coves along the Pearl River and notices above the fresh water springs warned that they were poisoned. On 24 August, the Portuguese Governor of Macao, Adriao Accacio da Silveira Pinto, announced that the Chinese had ordered him to expel the British from the colony. He warned Lancelot Dent of the British hong Dent & Co. that the Chinese planned to seize the British dwellings in Macao.Hanes & Sanello 2002, p. 63 On 25 August, former Superintendent John Astell proposed to Elliot that all British boats should evacuate to Hong Kong.Correspondence Relating to China 1840, p. 435 By the end of the month, 2,000 people in over 60 ships were in Hong Kong harbour without fresh food or water. The ships held European merchants, lascars, and dozens of British families. The 28-gun frigate Volage of Captain Henry Smith sailed to Hong Kong on 30 August. Smith was an old friend of Elliot from their service in the West Indies Station. Elliot warned Kowloon officials that there was bound to be trouble if the embargo continued against the merchant fleet.Hoe & Roebuck 1999, p. 93  Battle  View of Hong Kong Island from Kowloon, c. 1841 On 4 September, Elliot sailed to Kowloon in the 14-gun cutter Louisa for food supplies, accompanied by the 6-gun schooner Pearl, and a 1-gun pinnace from the Volage of Captain Smith. Upon arrival, they encountered three anchored Chinese men- of-war junks, whose presence prevented the regular supplies of food. Elliot sent interpreter Karl Gutzlaff in a small boat with two men to the centremost junk, which Elliot thought was the commanding vessel due to its size and superior equipment.Correspondence Relating to China 1840, p. 446Mao 2016, p. 116 Gutzlaff took two documents that he translated from Elliot. They included demands for food shipments to be restored and a plea not to repeat the poisoning of the colony's water springs. After a Chinese spokesman read the messages, he told Gutzlaff that they lacked the authority to renew food sales but was willing to report the matter to his superiors. Gutzlaff responded, \\"Suppose you were without food for any length of time, and debarred from buying it, would you wait until the case was transmitted to the higher authorities, or procure for yourself the same by every means in your power?\\" to which they exclaimed, \\"Certainly nobody will like to starve, and necessity has no law.\\"Correspondence Relating to China 1840, p. 449 They then directed him to another junk where a naval officer was said to reside. The local Chinese commander was Lieutenant-Colonel Lai Enjue.Waley 1958, p. 70 There, Gutzlaff restated his request to allow people to come out and sell provisions. He repeatedly went back and forth between the two parties, repeating details of the conversations with Elliot. He also took ¬£200 and told the Chinese that they would not leave without supplies. Soon afterwards, the Chinese soldiers went off in a boat to consult with the officer in the adjacent fort and promised to relay his opinion; it appeared nothing could be done unless the matter was reported to the deputy of the commissioner, who resided in the neighbourhood, and leave obtained from the plenipotentiary himself. After a Chinese request to know the items wanted, Gutzlaff wrote a list. He was told they could not be procured but items would be given to satisfy immediate necessities. According to Gutzlaff, this was \\"a mere manoeuvre\\" to gain time in manning the fort. He reported, \\"After the most pathetic appeal to their feelings, and having described the disasters which certainly would ensue from their obstinacy, I left them, and returned on board the cutter\\". After five or six hours of what Elliot called \\"delay and irritating evasion\\", he sent a boatload of people on shore to a distant part of the bay with money to purchase provisions, which they accomplished, but were then obliged by mandarin authorities to return them. In his report, Elliot wrote that he felt \\"greatly provoked\\" upon hearing this and opened fire on the junks in what became the first armed conflict of the First Opium War.Hanes & Sanello 2002, p. 66 According to Adam Elmslie, a young Superintendency clerk who was present, Elliot sent a message at 2 pm, warning the Chinese that if they did not receive provisions in half an hour, they would sink the junks. When the ultimatum expired with no results, Smith ordered his pinnace to fire, after which Elmslie observed: The cutter Louisa (centre) in 1834 At 3:45 pm, the shore batteries opened fire in support of the junks. By 4:30 pm, the Louisa had fired 104 rounds.Elleman 2001, p. 17 Running low on ammunition, the British sailed away,Elleman 2001, p. 18 with the pinnace having gone for help.Fay 1975, p. 175 The junks pursued the retreating vessels; the Pearl was half the size of the junks and the Louisa a quarter of the size. After replenishing their cartridges, both boats re-engaged the junks, which the clerk described: Meanwhile, British reinforcements were arriving, including the barge from the East Indiaman Cambridge commanded by Captain Joseph Abraham Douglas and manned by 18 seamen. During the re-engagement, the junks retreated to their former positions.Correspondence Relating to China 1840, p. 447 The battle ended in a stalemate. The Volage later arrived and weighed with the armed boats of the fleet, but night came and put an end to the engagement. The next morning, the junks were evacuated and with the mandarins offering \\"no molestation\\", Elliot did not carry the conflict further.Le Pichon 2006, p. 379 In total, three British were wounded; a flesh wound in the arm of Douglas, and two of his crew more severely. Lin reported two Chinese killed and six wounded.Chang 1964, p. 203  Aftermath  During the evening, Elliot and Smith discussed destroying the three junks and deploying men to attack the battery the next day, but Smith acceded to Elliot's recommendation not to do so. Elliot stated that an attack would destroy the village and cause \\"great injury and irritation\\" to the inhabitants. In a letter to trader James Matheson on 5 September, Elliot felt that it would be unbecoming of a British warship to shoot to death the Chinese junks, which his \\"poor Cutter\\" could do under their batteries. He wrote: \\"Perhaps I ought not to have fired at all but every man's patience has limits and mine has been sorely tried. I am afraid I have disappointed the men's ardent spirits here but I believe I have done well to refrain.\\"Le Pichon 2006, p. 377 He circulated a paper on shore the same day which stated: American sea captain Robert Bennet Forbes described the event in a letter to his wife a day after the clash: The British were able to obtain provisions after the skirmish but they were slightly more expensive. English sinologist Arthur Waley theorised that given the corruption of the Canton Navy, Chinese patrol boats tried to obtain bribes from the peasants by offering to turn a blind eye on their trading activities during the embargo. Since the bribes were larger than they were willing to pay, the embargo was enforced and the British were cut from the supplies. But after the battle, the Chinese were disinclined to risk another naval confrontation and accepted a smaller bribe from the peasants, resulting in food supplies being available again but at a slightly higher price. The Chinese commander Lai sent a disingenuous report of victory, claiming to have sunk a two-masted English ship and inflicted at least 40 or 50 casualties. This is the first of what Chinese accounts later called the \\"Six Smashing Blows\\" against the British navy. However, these accounts were fabricated and the official misreporting of events were repeated throughout the war.Elleman 2001, p. 15 To understand why the Chinese made such reports, Waley explained that any military action, whether successful or not, was followed by a scramble to get mentioned in the official report to the throne as an incentive for receiving a decoration, promotion, or other reward. The number of alleged casualties inflicted on the enemy was often based on what officers thought would entitle them to the reward they had in mind. Although Lin forwarded Lai's concocted reports to the Daoguang Emperor, Waley noted that it is unclear to what extent, if any, that Lin was aware of the fabrications, especially since he was regarded as a man of unusually high integrity by the British and Chinese.Waley 1958, pp. 71‚Äì72 This was the first in a series of reports in which the emperor became aware in 1841 that the Canton authorities had been systematically deceiving him about events during the war.Waley 1958, p. 72 The emperor ordered the Governor of Guangxi, Liang Chang-ch√º, to send him clear accounts of the events at Canton, noting that since Guangxi was a neighbouring province, Liang must be receiving independent accounts. He warned Liang that he would be able to verify his information by secret inquiries from other places.Waley 1958, p. 73  Notes   References  *Cameron, Nigel (1991).

Biography Fleetwood was the son of Sir William Fleetwood (died after 1610) of Ealing and Cranford, Middlesex, who was receiver-general of the court of wards and liveries until he was sequestered from this office in 1609. Fleetwood was admitted to Gray's Inn on 9 January 1588. In 1602 he was knighted in Dublin by Lord Blount, the Lord Deputy of Ireland. In 1604 Fleetwood had been granted a reversion on the office of receiver-general of the court of wards and liveries on the death of his father, but because of the sequestration he obtained the position on 22 March 1610 which was before his father's death. Fleetwood made the office profitable enough that by 1618 he was lending money to the Crown. In 1614 Fleetwood was elected Member of Parliament for Huntingdon, in 1621 for Westbury and in 1624 for Launceston. In 1625 and 1626 he was elected to represent Newton, Lancashire and in 1628 New Woodstock. In April 1640 he was elected as one of the members of parliament for Hindon in the Short Parliament and was re-elected in November 1640 for the Long Parliament. He held the seat until his death in 1641. His financial interests and those of King Charles I were thoroughly intertwined and he remained a strong supporter of the King throughout his life. Family In 1599 Fleetwood married Anne, daughter of Nicholas Luke of Woodend, Bedfordshire. cites: pedigree communicated by W. S. Churchill, esq.

Early life and education Cohen was born on September 28, 1944 in Brockton, Massachusetts, where he showed a predilection for science at an early age. He attended Harvard College as an undergraduate, earning his degree in 1966, and four years later graduated from the Georgetown University School of Medicine. Career Cohen worked for a time in the United States Public Health Service before becoming the founding Director of the Center on Aging at the National Institute of Mental Health in 1975. In 1981, he earned a Doctorate in Gerontology at the Union Institute and University. He went on to serve as Acting Director of the National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health from 1991-1993 and found the Center on Aging, Health, and the Humanities at the George Washington University in 1994. Cohen was a dedicated advocate of the idea that the aged are capable of functioning at high levels of creativity and intellectual rigor. When his career began, the medical profession largely treated aging like a disease, but Cohen argued based on his research that the brain would continue creating new cells at any age so long as it was engaged in new and challenging intellectual activities. His work in a number of studies on aging supported this belief, including a 2002 study which suggested that involvement in the arts late in life led to a lower incidence of illness and injury. According to Dr. Walter Reich, a colleague at George Washington University, \\"Single-handedly he changed the image of aging from one of senescence to a period of creativity.\\" Cohen was a prolific writer. His theories and research were published in a multitude of books, three of which he was the sole author and more than 150 others which he co-wrote or edited. Among his other contributions to his field, he helped found two journals on geriatric psychiatry, served as President of the Gerontological Society of America, and appeared on television programs as an expert on aging and with George Burns in Public Service Announcements. He also developed a number of therapeutic activities, including intergenerational games. Two of his creations were patented, a combination of chess and scrabble called World War Three and a variation of cribbage. He is featured in the 2009 documentary film on Alzheimer's and the creative arts I Remember Better When I Paint. Cohen died at 65 of prostate cancer on November 7, 2009, in Kensington, Maryland.

He completed his schooling after the family's return to Somerset. Rather than follow his father into the army, he migrated in 1923 to South Australia as one of the Barwell Boys. He was first indentured as a farm labourer to E. H. Mattner of Clare, South Australia but failed to impress however, and likewise failed in a 1925 apprenticeship to printer Hunter Brothers of Leabrook. In 1928 he began teaching at Scotch College, Adelaide followed by a stint at Tudor House, Moss Vale, New South Wales then from 1930‚Äì1933 at Scots College, Sydney. He was meanwhile building his stage skills with Doris Fitton's Independent Theatre, featuring in productions such as Musical Chairs and Ship of Heaven until 1933, when he started working professionally for J C Williamson in musical comedies. Radio career In 1935 he signed up as an announcer with radio 2GB, headquarters of the Macquarie Radio Network, eventually becoming its chief announcer. He has been named as one of the 'Five D's of Australian Radio' with Jack Davey, Bob Dyer, Terry Dear and Harry Dearth. His longest-running program was World Famous Tenors. Other programs include Nature Speaks (sponsored by Edward Hallstrom) 1947 ‚Äì 54.https://200years.auspost.com.au/html/loan/archive/view_detail/1330 As a volunteer he recorded approximately two hundred Talking Books for the Blind. The Quiz Kids In 1942 he began the program for which he is now best remembered, The Quiz Kids. Modelled on a US program of the same name (one of whose panel members was the young James D. Watson), its format involved a panel of five Sydney schoolboys and girls aged 11 to 15, who were challenged by questions sent in by listeners from all around Australia. The listener was rewarded with cash and sponsors' products in the event of no 'Quiz Kid' supplying a satisfactory answer. A separate panel in Melbourne was used for six weeks each year. Dease played the avuncular quizmaster. In all publicity photographs and public appearances he wore an academic gown and mortarboard, as were the panel members, many of whom, such as NSW premier Neville Wran, senior academics John Lambert, Jack Goldring and James Seymour Hagan, were to achieve eminence as adults. Barry Jones, who later went on to become a Labor politician, was a member of the Melbourne panel in 1947 and 1948. Others included Sue Pearson (mother of Christopher Pearson), David Low, Nola Manning, Michael Connors, Leon Smith, Yvonne Cossart, Milton Osborne, Alana Conlan, Tom Kalmar, Annette Cumine. The first team in 1942 consisted of James Hagan, Bernard Lake, Alan Mitchell, Audrey Baker and Dorothy Revie. The program was broadcast on 2GB Sunday 7:30pm; Tuesday 8pm from 1943; Sunday 7:30pm from 1959 and was terminated on 14 October 1962. Sponsors were Colgate-Palmolive 1942‚Äì1944; Johnson & Johnson 1944‚Äì1958(?). The program was revived for television on ABC Television from 1964‚Äì1968 after an abortive simulcast attempt in 1957.http://www.memorabletv.com/australia/tvaq.htm Acting career Dease was an active supporter of live theatre, helping Peter Finch establish the Mercury Theatre in 1946. Apart from parts in episodes of various TV series (Chopper Squad, Case for the Defence, Certain Women), he played Sir Hubert Wilkins in the 1946 movie Smithy, 'Whitty' in the 1970 movie Ned Kelly and newsreader 'Ken' in the successful 1978 movie Newsfront. He was also in demand as commentator on newsreels and travelogues such as The Dance of the Eyes. Personal life Always of left-wing political persuasion (he was associated with the Aid Russia Committee Paper and presented a paper at the Congress of Friendship and Aid to the Soviet Union in Sydney Town Hall, 30 August 1941), he was elected vice-president of Actors Equity but forced to resign in 1948 after being labelled a Communist. In 1972 he appeared in a Labor Party advertisement under the slogan It's Time although he was an Australia Party candidate for the federal seat of Evans. He joined the Labor Party in 1974. Dease married Margaret Mary Mildred 'Greta' Lofberg in December 1938. She publicly filed for divorce in 1944. He remarried in 1948 to Rankura 'Kura' Margery De Villiers Walmsley n√©e East.

This school is mainly present in the Francophone countries, Brazil and another form in Scandinavia. * The ergonomics of the human factors, focusing on research results General (on the postures, rhythms, moods of work ...) and definition of standards. It is dominant in the United States and Japan. Definitions Activity-centered ergonomics uses knowledge from the physiology of labor, cognitive psychology (memory attention, collection learning ...) and the psycho-physiology (alert, posture, working conditions ...), sociology of organizations (distribution of functions, organizations in the chain of command, the string functional, social psychology, linguistics, among others: in fact all sciences relating to man). It is based on models of the work situation (especially that of Jacques Christol, Jacques Leplat and Gilbert De Terssac) that focus on the difference nature between the task (project record, the field of virtual future) and activity (body ‚Äì the brain of course) who takes positions and makes movements activates the controls, manages (consciously or not) thought processes, communicate with others, organizes his actions, etc.. The first feature of the analysis of this activity is that the operator \\"regulates\\" the activity, according to its external environment, its internal state (e.g. fatigue) to ensure maximum consistency of performance: accelerating the pace of work to catch up with the delay or face an emergency change procedure against poor results ... The second dominant feature is the concept of compromise between the requirements of performance (explicitly or implicitly always present) and requirements related to compliance with the rules (Security of management, technical, administrative ...). The Observer of the work activity notesalways that this compromise exists, and it is not built as would the organizations, focusing on the rule prescribed first. The reality is complex, as in everyday life, where we all respect the speed limit on the road ... unless we're afraid of missing our train, or arrive late to an urgent appointment ... This \\"cognitive compromise\\" is also affected by aspects psychic s of activity, insofar as studies of psychological aspects of work, increasing show that the achievement of production requires more and more not only to compromise with the security (which is never written) but also with its afraid, its stress his emotions etc.. This compromise can be considered \\"room\\", without going on the field with operators in business, whether to make a machine, a workstation or a computer interface: the standards and rules are inadequate ever. Ergonomics analysis of work Ergonomic analysis of work (EAW) is the main tool of the activity-centered ergonomic intervention. It can help to solve several problems related to working conditions or the design of tools and equipment. * Aspects of health in work  On the physical health including the musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) affecting 12 to 14% of employees  On the mental health risks due to particular psycho-social (in stress) can cause anxiety-depressive syndromes (about 8% of employees) * Aspects of performance Improving productivity Improving quality = EAW, an influenced analysis =  EAW, a \\"located\\" analysis  It is with the demand analysis and hypothesis he has made during the pre-diagnosis that the ergonomist will be able to choose situations to consider: * Ensure sufficient mastery of technical data concerning the work situation; * Build reference tools for description and interpretation of data; * Give himself a medium for demonstration and communication.  The different elements of influence on work  The work activity is influenced by a multitude of facets. The ergonomist must rely on these aspects and compare the actual work for generating insights relevant to the problems posed * The technical process : These are views which focus on flows and processing steps of a product or information * The tools and media : An analysis of the means available to employees to obtain or receive information and act on the process to better prepare some investigations * The relationship between the variables of a device : In explanation with the operator or guidance, it is possible that reflected different variables to the settings or status of the device technology (e.g. quality). It is then possible to relate with each other. * Procedures : The sequences of a process as provided corresponds only very rarely that transactions made by employees. * Dependencies and stops time : The work activity may enroll in a timeframe more or less structured by the process, by advancing the work of other employees, or by events outside the company. * The layout of the technical device : Often, initial plans of arrangement are now outdated. Indeed, subsequent implementations of equipment have been made.  choice of the situations to analyze  It is rather difficult to extract a maxim or a rule in the choose of a situation that the ergonomist will do. The criteria he will use depending on the problem and the structure of the company. But it may be, for example, situations: * Where complaints are most numerous * Where the consequences are more serious * Where the range of problems is the widest * Playing a central role in the functioning of the company * To be processing more or less long term = Analysis by the activity= At first glance, each is tempted by the establishment of relations of direct causation between working conditions and health consequences or effectiveness. A noisy situation makes deaf, carrying heavy loads of produce musculoskeletal disorder, bad lighting, eyestrain, etc.. Unfortunately, this approach has important limitations: protection against noise may prohibit access to the machine, etc. ... In fact, this approach neglects the fact that these relations necessarily pass through the activity of the employee. Indeed, it makes compromises with respect to constraints (it does not have them) to achieve the goals that are set and to limit the inconvenience caused by the tasks. For this reason, the ergonomist must focus its ergonomic analysis of work activity: it is in and by the activity of the operator in creating the effects of working conditions. The role, in this context, analysis of the activity is not an evaluation (the workload for example) but the description and explanation of the mechanisms involved = The tools available to the ergonomist = The observation  The observation is a specific feature in the Ergonomic analysis of work compared to other methods. This is to focus on the work as directed, whereas other approaches rely on \\"representations\\". Observation can be carried out openly or by focusing on the collection of certain categories of information with specific goals (we call then systematic observation). * Broad observables categories : Travel, The direction of regards, Communications, Postures, The actions taken or information, Comments on the technical system and context, The collective * Technical statement, there exist a variety of techniques to conduct surveys. The choice is made by the ergonomist in the constraints and circumstances. We'll list them here: The statements manuals, Video recordings, The Activity Chronic, The Metrics The verbalizations To understand the activity, working conditions and their consequences, the verbalization of the employee is essential because: Activity can be reduced to what is observable; The comments and actions take place at one moment, we must re-situate more broadly; The consequences of the activity are not all apparent. However, there are limits to the verbalization to be taken into account: * The employee described the work and its consequences in terms of what it believes to be the goals and interests of the speaker; * The routine operations or learning old are not always mentioned spontaneously; * Some aspects of the activities lend themselves well to verbal expression.

He traveled to more than 80 countries preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Many of the claimed miracles that occurred during his crusades have been documented in books, magazines and newspapers. These miracles included healings of the crippled, blind, deaf, mute, and terminally ill. Early life Domingo Pilarte was born in the Dominican Republic on February 23, 1941. He began preaching shortly after a near death experience where he lost his brother during a boating trip. He explains how God spoke to him and rescued him that day after nearly drowning, he documented this experience in his book titled My Calling. Ministry Pilarte, at the age of 17, began preaching a simple message of salvation through Jesus Christ. It wasn't long before his ministry grew and he began preaching in stadiums around the world. He traveled to many countries including Venezuela, Panama, Costa Rica, Colombia, Africa, Japan, Trinidad & Tobago, and the US. There were many claims of miracles witnessed during his crusades. Family Domingo Pilarte Sr. died on November 15, 2009. He is succeeded by his 5 children, Jimmy Pilarte, Josie Pilarte, Debbie Pilarte, and Ruth Pilarte.

SDP ‚Äúis a defined series of steps you follow as you guide prospects from initial contact to purchase.‚Äù Marketing [m.o.] Strategic Marketing Process eBook. Moderandi Inc., 2009 This method includes planning specific timelines and milestones at the beginning of a sale, both internally and with the business customer. The process can be managed with special purpose SDP software. SDP software allows customers and vendors to work collaboratively throughout a sales cycle with the objective to close larger/longer deals faster. An SDP system is typically integrated with software that automates some of the sales process (Sales Force Automation) and one that helps manage the customer data (Customer relationship management). SDP manages the sales process while the SFA and CRM manage the customer.  Overview  SDP takes the concept of customer driven sales automation and turns it on its head. It recognizes that a business can‚Äôt control individuals or teams but it can control the company‚Äôs sales process. SDP allows customers and vendors to work collaboratively throughout the sales cycle. This collaboration drives the sales toward a final decision. SDP steps can include: *Presentations *Demos *Buy-in from stakeholders *Budget approval *Business Cases *Case Studies *Reference visits *Contract negotiations Each sales cycle is essentially a project with associated milestones, tasks, and deliverables that require participation, coordination, and contributions from multiple individuals on both the customer side and sales side. According to IT industry experts, investing in decision process software can make a competitive difference in any industry. An article in the Harvard Business Review by Andrew McAfee and Eric Brynjolfsson, says market competition in the United States is heating up ‚Äúnot because more products are becoming digital but because more processes are. Just as a digital photo or a web-search algorithm can be endlessly replicated quickly and accurately by copying the underlying bits, a company‚Äôs unique business process can now be propagated with much higher fidelity across the organization by embedding it in enterprise information technology. As a result, an innovator with a better way of doing things can‚Ä¶dominate an industry.‚Äù McAfee, Andrew; Erik Brynjolfsson (2008). ‚ÄúInvesting in the IT That Makes a Competitive Difference‚Äù. Harvard Business Review (http://hbr.harvardbusiness.org/investing-in-the-it-that-makes-a- competitive-derrerence).  Advantages  Historically, the sales decision process has been managed through the common sales practice of Close Plans or Solution Evaluation Plans that pass information in Excel or Word Documents back-and-forth between customer and vendor. This creates challenges with version control, data latency, poor visibility, and lack of productive participation.Youmans, Holly (2009). ‚ÄúNew Software Helps Builders Get to Closings Faster‚Äù. NBN Online (http://www.nbnnews.com/NBN/textonly/2009-10-26/Business With SDP software user can benefit from: 1\\\\. Faster Close Rates and Lower Cost of Sale: Instead of filling-in, filing, and sending Excel or Word based Close Plans, users can simply update the SDP on-line. SDP can generate milestones, assign tasks, send reminders, and track completion dates. A tighter sales cycle equals faster close rates and lowers the overall costs of sale. 2\\\\. A Competitive Advantage: SDP technology drives teamwork, greater efficiencies, and clearer communication during each step of the sales cycle giving companies an edge over their competition. 3\\\\. Reliable Close Dates: SDP provides effective collaboration between customer and vendor on every step in the sales cycle to create on-going check-points and a mutually agreed upon close date. 4\\\\. One Source of Truth: Instead of passing Word or Excel based close plans back-and- forth that can suffer from version control and scattered islands of information ‚Äì SDP provides secure web-based access from any browser to quickly view up-to-the-minute consolidated information (including GANTT charts) on the status of the sale. Timely updates accurately set expectations for the customer, sales management, and the entire extended sales team.  Disadvantages  Problems can occur if the company implementing a new SDP system does not outline a realistic sales approach to roadmap the process. If the sales team does not perceive SDP as a benefit, they are unlikely to buy into the process and use the software effectively.  Implementation strategies  Sales and Marketing experts recommend that companies speak with their salespeople and their customers for insight in order to achieve a successful implementation of a formalized SDP system. ‚ÄúA thorough understanding of the process is required to compete effectively, according to Pat Thull, COO/Partner of Prime Resource Group Inc.‚Äù The smart performer today, and the smart leader, implements a system that properly navigates the process to getting the job done right.Thull, Pat (2009). Are You Simply Putting Your Team at the Mercy of the Economy?‚Äù Prime Resource Group (http://www.primeresource.com/prime-resource-article.html) Once that is complete, it is imperative to ‚Äúsell‚Äù the sales team. Sales teams need to understand how SDP will help them better manage and close deals. This is what gives them the confidence and drive to use the system.

Chatters (born March 20, 1949) is an American forensic anthropologist, archaeologist, and paleontologist. , he is the owner of forensics consulting firm, Applied Paleoscience; and serves as a Research Associate in the Office of Graduate Studies, Research, and Continuing Education at Central Washington University; Deputy Coroner of Benton County, Washington; and a consulting scientist on staff with Foster Wheeler Environmental Corporation of Bothell, Washington. In 1996, Chatters was the first scientist to excavate and study the prehistoric (Paleo-Indian) skeletal remains, known as Kennewick Man, which were discovered on the banks of the Columbia River.  Educational background  James Chatters attended Washington State University in Pullman, Washington, graduating in 1971 with a Bachelor's degree in Anthropology. He then enrolled in the University of Washington in Seattle, where he continued his study of Anthropology, earning his Master's degree and Ph.D in 1975 and 1982, respectively.  Professional background  Since 1964, Chatters has participated in archeological studies and excavations, and provided osteological analyses throughout the western US and the Pacific Northwest, as well as Hawaii, Alaska, Minnesota, Texas, the province of Saskatchewan in Canada, and the country of Brazil. After earning his Master's degree in 1975, he began participating in paleoecological projects in the western US, along with Kentucky and Maryland. In the fall of 1977, he served as an archeologist in the Custer National Forest in Watford City, North Dakota. The following year, he returned to the University of Washington, to pursue his Ph.D in Anthropology, while simultaneously serving as the Acting Director of the Office of Public Archeology for the school. From 1980‚Äì81, he served as an assistant professor with the Department of Anthropology at Central Washington University, and in 1982, he began serving as the Associate Director of the Central Washington Archaeological Survey. In 1987, Chatters relocated to the Tri-Cities, where he joined the staff of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, also known as Battelle-Northwest, serving as Senior Research Scientist in the Environmental Sciences Department. He held this role until 1993, when he chose to establish the forensics consulting firm if Applied Paleoscience. It is in this role that he has provided forensic analysis and scientific research for government agencies, law enforcement officials, and tribal nations throughout the Northwest. = Kennewick Man discovery = On July 28, 1996, two local students, Will Thomas and Dave Deacy, discovered a skull embedded in the mud and underbrush of the south bank of the Columbia River, while they were wandering alongside the river during the Tri-City Water Follies hydroplane boat races.Hunt, Morton M. The New Know-Nothings: The Political Foes of the Scientific Study of Human Nature, Transaction Publishers, page 320, 1999. After they alerted a local police officer, a local dive team went out to the area, gathered more bone fragments along with the skull, then taped off the shore for protection, as a possible crime scene. At the time of the discovery, Chatters owned a forensics consulting business called Applied Paleoscience, in which he often worked with local government officials and law enforcement to assist with criminal investigations.Meltzer, David J. First Peoples in a New World: Colonizing Ice Age America, University of California Press, page 177, 2009. He also consulted with Northwest tribes to assist with protection and repatriation of Native American remains discovered throughout the Columbia Basin. On the early evening of the discovery, the Benton County Coroner, Floyd Johnson, called Chatters to ask him to take a look at the skull to determine if it belonged to a current or recent crime victim. Chatters, eager to help, invited Johnson to bring the skull over to his home, after which they quickly returned to the discovery site to gather more skeletal remains, before the sun would set that evening. His initial assessment determined that the skull displayed characteristics consistent with ancient Paleo-Indian remains. Subsequent tests determined that the remains dated back to a calibrated age of 9,800 years. Chatters' scientific findings brought controversy to the discovery and triggered a nine-year legal battle between scientists, the US Army Corps of Engineers, and Native American tribes, who attempted to claim the remains as one of their ancestors, in accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). Various Northwest tribes, including the Umatilla, Yakama, Colville, Nez Perce, and Wanapum nations all asserted rights to claim the remains for immediate reburial, without further scientific study or examination. The US Army Corps of Engineers, who oversaw the land where the remains were found, agreed to comply with the requests of the tribes. Before the transfer could be made, eight scientists filed a lawsuit asserting their legal right to study the remains. They believed that the bones were a rare national treasure, that held the potential to reveal vital information about the peopling of the North American continent.Bonnichsen, et al. v. United States, et al., no. 02-35994 (9th Cir. Feb. 4, 2004) In 2002, a federal court in the state of Oregon ruled that the tribes failed to establish viable and definitive cultural links between themselves and Kennewick Man. This ruling opened up the way for Chatters and the team of eight scientists to study the remains. Following an appeal in February 2004, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the decision. The ruling additionally set a precedent, ensuring that any future discovery of ancient remains would also be made available for scientific studies. However, in 2015, Kennewick Man was shown to be more closely related to local indigenous populations than to any other group, worldwide, thanks to DNA analysis.\\"Rasmussen et al. 2015. Nature 523: 455-458\\" Chatter's team, using craniometry, had concluded that Kennewick Man was related to western or south- pacific populations such as the Ainu or the Polynesians.

Description  The glacier is of an outlet type with a sea calving terminus. It occupies of Spitsbergen, which is covered in glaciers for 80% of its land mass. The glacier is one of the most extensively studied in Spitsbergen and has been monitored for annual volume changes since 1987. Kongsvegen is long and currently retreating in length, following a surge around 1948, although it has been growing in ice mass since 1987. = Movement = The Kongsvegen is classified as a polythermal glacier, with large variations in the temperature of the ice below. The ice near the surface (between 50 and 160 metres down (160-520 feet)) is very cold, and overlies a much warmer base of ice. This leads to increased mass flow and velocity over the summer months, usually because of the build-up of meltwater at the base, which lubricates the glacier in basal sliding. The glacier is of a surge type, meaning that its length and characteristics can vary rapidly over time, making the ice field very unpredictable. It also means the glacier can undergo rapid periods of advancing and retreating movement. From 1948 to 1977 the glacier retreated very quickly at rates of up to 800 metres per year after a large surge in its movement downstream. Kongsvegen has also experienced periods, as now, of relative stasis. At the moment Kongsvegen is retreating at 3 metres (10 feet) per year and has been doing so since 1990. This has allowed the glacier to build up its ice mass further upstream, while shrinking in length downstream, where the ice is thin from rapid movement.  Terminus  The glacier finishes at its merger with another glacier, the Kronebreen, another surge glacier moving at around 750 metres per year, along a ice front with dirty 5- to 20-metre-high ice cliffs, as the Kongsbreen picks up medial moraine and englacial debris.

Beginning in 1864, the Italian Government had sent emissaries into Syria and Mesopotamia to purchase desert bred Arabian horses directly from Bedouin tribes.Ajroldi di Robbiate E (1908), Sull‚Äôacquisto di stalloni arabi in Oriente 1907-1908 (Rome: [n.pub.], 1908). Numerous stallions and mares were purchased and brought back to Sicily, many being destined for the Royal Remount Station in Catania. The breeding of Arabian Horses in Italy, therefore predates the Crabbet Park Stud which only started in 1878. Furthermore, the Crabbet Park Stud obtained most of its horses from the stables of Abbas-Pasha in Egypt, and therefore Africa, whereas the horses obtained from the Italian Government came directly from the Syrian Desert, and therefore from Asia and Arabia. One must also consider that the financial resources of a major European government must also surpass those of a private individual and a government can certainly afford to purchase much more expensive horses, since the purpose was to improve cavalry remounts and therefore national interest was at stake. Lastly, the Italian Government could also rely on the expertise of Carlo Guarmani, who was born in Italy in 1828, but whose family moved to the Middle East, where he was raised. He was fluent in Arabic and had a passion for horses, and spent 16 years traveling in Syria, Palestine, Egypt and Northern Arabia. He knew the Bedouins of the Syrian desert well and spent much time with them. He was commissioned to acquire Arab stallions for the stables of Napoleon III and for the then king of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele II. Although he had been to Egypt, he headed for the Syrian desert when he needed to purchase horses. His knowledge and direct contact with the Bedouins of the Arabian desert was far greater than that of Lady Anne Blunt, the founder of Crabbet Park Stud.The Pure Bred Arabian Horse. carlo Guarmani The PSO constitutes the oldest officially recognised Italian breed. The Puro Sangue Orientale is a mesomorphic or mesodolichomorphic horse, with particularly harmonious forms. It closely resembles an Arabian horse, being however a little taller and with more substantial physique. Height is between , with some specimens reaching . Average height of males is 148 cm, cannon bone circumference is 19 cm and chest circumference is 174 cm. Its coat is usually bay, chestnut or gray. It is therefore similar to a Shagya or a Tersk horse. Today there are only 170 specimens of this horse, of which 150 live in Sicily. Its numbers have been declining, and the Government Stud where it is bred is carrying out a policy of crossing with other strains of Arabian horses, causing the dilution of the qualities of the original Syrian desert bred strain.

He claimed the Heavyweight Championship of America in 1866 by defeating boxer Bill Davis after former champion Joe Coburn retired, and lost the title to Tom Allen in 1873. Early life McCoole was born on 12 March 1837 in Bally Bulay, County Donegal, Ireland, and came to America at the age of only 13, living first in New York, and then moving West, making a home first around Louisville, Kentucky and Cincinnati, Ohio.Lived first in New York in \\"Mike McCoole\\", The Evening Telegraph, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, pg.1, 31 August 1867 He worked on steam boats hauling freight on the Ohio and the Upper Mississippi, for most of his career.Born in Bally Bulay in \\"Mike McCoole's Death\\", St. Louis Post Dispatch, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 7, 18 October 1886 McCoole's boxing style was not highly scientific and finessed but aided by his strength, size and a frequent hard right. He occasionally used throws against smaller opponents in the hope it would wear them down. His first recorded bout was in April, 1858 for a purse of $100 against Bill Nary, a well reputed prize fighter, in Louisville, Kentucky, which he won in seventeen minutes and eight rounds.First prize fight in \\"Mike M'Coole\\", The Times Picayune, New Orleans, Louisiana, pg. 3, 18 October 1886 At the age of 22, McCoole defeated William Blake on Twelve Mile Island in the Ohio off Louisville, Kentucky on 29 June 1859 in thirty-seven minutes, and 29 rounds. It was a difficult battle, and McCoole had his nose damaged and his eyes nearly closed. Tom Jennings, a larger man and desperate hitter, fell to McCoole for a $500 purse in his third match on 2 May 1861, in only thirty-three minutes in New Orleans, Louisiana, McCoole's future home.\\"M'Coole\\", Chicago Tribune, Chicago, Illinois, pg. 2, 2 September 1867 London Prize Ring rules Under the English Broughton rules of prize fighting, used by McCoole, if a boxer went down and could not continue after 30 seconds, the fight ended. Hitting a downed fighter and grasping or hitting below the waist were prohibited. Broughton invented and encouraged the use of \\"mufflers\\", a form of padded gloves, which were used in training and exhibitions, but not prize fights. The advent of the Broughton rules around 1743 did allow fighters an advantage not enjoyed by modern boxers; a boxer could drop to one knee to start a 30-second count at any point in the match, but overuse of this privilege was frowned upon and sometimes disallowed by the judges. By 1866, when McCoole began boxing in earnest, the Broughton Rules had evolved into the slightly more civilized London Prize Ring Rules promulgated in 1843. Fine scientific boxing with a calculated defense involving feints with the arms and forward foot were rarely a feature of bare-knuckle boxing in the 1860s, nor necessary with the undisciplined nature of London Prize Ring Rules. The rules also outlawed head butting, holding the ropes, strangling, using resin, stones or hard objects in the hands, and biting. Other than gouging, hitting a man when he was down, kicking, or hitting or grabbing below the waist, most moves were permitted, including throwing a man down or holding him to inflict blows. McCoole first fought Joe Coburn for the American heavyweight championship and a purse of $2,000 on 5 May 1863 in Charlestown, Maryland, losing in 67 rounds and in a time of 1:10:00. The substantial crowd of 2,000 assembled about 30 feet from the shore of the North East River, a remote area, to elude police who may have stopped the fight. When compared to his opponent, McCoole was two years younger, around 20 pounds heavier, and had a height advantage of around three and a half inches. Coburn appeared from early in the fight to have the upper hand, but he was thrown heavily to the ground in the early rounds by his larger opponent, a move allowed under London Prize Ring Rules. Coburn appeared lighter on his feet than the heavier man, and with greater science dealt two blows to each one of McCoole's. McCoole continued to begin each round and absorb punishment. By the 67th, McCoole was badly injured and exhausted from loss of blood. When the fight was called at the end of the 68th, McCoole was said to be \\"frightfully bruised and disfigured\\".\\"The Great Prize Fight\\", The Cecil Whig, Elkton, Maryland, pg. 2, 9 May 1863Frightfully bruised in \\"The Fight For the Championship\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 2, 6 May 1863 American heavyweight champion, 1866 McCoole secured the heavyweight championship of America by defeating Bill Davis in 35 rounds and 34 minutes on 19 September 1866 at \\"Chouteau Island\\" in Madison County, Illinois. Joe Coburn had previously vacated the title in 1865 due to his retirement from boxing, allowing McCoole to fight for the title against Davis. Coburn later returned to the ring without the title. Taking place at 4 pm, there was a purse of $500, to be split by each contestant, and a championship belt containing gold and silver, at stake. McCoole dominated the bout, appearing to have a weight advantage of at least 15 pounds, and had the first knockdown in the first round. McCoole's greater weight made a difference as he fell upon Davis several times, and had a far heavier punch. In the brutal affair, Davis was down in both the thirty-second and thirty-third rounds.Down in 32nd and 33rd in \\"The Ring\\", The Louisville Daily Courier, Louisville, Kentucky, pg. 4, 21 September 1866 McCoole punched Davis, who was badly injured, \\"all over the ring\\" in the 35th when Davis's seconds threw up the sponge, ending the fight.\\"Prize Fight at St. Louis\\", \\"Pittsburgh Daily Post\\", Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 1, 20 September 1866McCoole fell on Davis in \\"M'Coole\\", Chicago Tribune, Chicago, Illinois, pg. 2, 2 September 1867 Defense of the championship, 1867 On 31 August 1867, McCoole successfully defended the championship against English-born Aaron Jones before an impressive 3,500 spectators near a railway station in a beautiful grove at Busenbark's Station, Ohio, winning in thirty-four rounds and twenty-six minutes. Jones was four years older at 35, an inch and a half shorter and before the fight, around eight pounds lighter than McCoole. In the brutal affair, Jones was knocked out in the 34th round, and was believed to have two broken ribs and a concussion.Chicago Tribune, Chicago, Illinois, pg. 2, 2 September 1867 Jones was down in the thirty-second and thirty-third, possibly to end the rounds. Jones appeared to be \\"completely overwhelmed\\" by McCoole, and fought with little science or a studied defense. McCoole scored the final knockdown with a terrible right between the eyes of Jones, who was borne away by carriage a half hour later. McCoole's vanquished opponent had fought his last fight, and according to at least one source died several years later, partly from injuries to his lungs caused by his broken ribs in the match.The InterOcean, \\"Aaron Jones Burial Place\\", p. 4, 13 November 1886A terrible right in \\"The Great Mill\\", Cincinnati Enquirer, Cincinnati, Ohio, pg. 1, 2 September 1867Height and weight of Jones in \\"Jones\\", Chicago Tribune, Chicago, Illinois, pg. 2, 2 September 1867 In September 1867, McCoole scheduled three exhibitions with Adam Jones, but the outcome of these fights remain unknown. McCoole scheduled a heavyweight championship fight with former champion Joe Coburn in Cold Spring Station, Indiana for 27 May 1868 which was cancelled when the police intervened and arrested both Coburn and his trainer, having previously arrested McCoole. Both boxers were imprisoned in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, but were released on July 3. The impressive purse was for $5,000 a side.

With his championship winnings, he opened a popular Saloon in St. Louis, on the corner of Washington and Fifth Streets which he continued to operate through the early 1870s. The Saloon would be mentioned frequently in local papers for assaults, shootings, and thefts.Married and opened a saloon in \\"Mike M'Coole\\", The Times Picayune, New Orleans, Louisiana, pg. 3, 18 October 1886Marriage in \\"Domestic News\\", Daily Ohio Statesman, Columbus, Ohio, pg. 3, 11 August 1868 Losing the championship, 1873 On the day before his championship fight against Tom Allen in St. Louis, both boxers were arrested and required to post a bond of $1,000 to keep the peace.\\"Spoiling for a Fight\\", Ottawa Daily Citizen, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, 23 September 1873, pg. 4. Nonetheless, the fight took place the following day on 23 September 1873 with a seventh round win by Allen at Chouteau Island in Madison County, Illinois. A crowd of around 2,000 assembled to watch the bout.A crowd of 2000 in The Daily Commonwealth, pg. 1, 24 September 1873 Allen fought at 172 pounds, winning the bout despite a sixteen-pound weight disadvantage, and a three-inch disadvantage in height. McCoole was considered by many historians to be the more awkward boxer, and took the fiercer punishment in the first three rounds, with Allen opening a cut on his right eye, which he continued to pound. By the fourth round, he was down for the first time, and a terrible site to behold. The fifth round saw Allen doling out additional punishment to McCoole, and in the final round Allen started off with several mighty blows to McCoole's face, soon ending the bout. McCoole had a terrible cut under his right eye with damage to his left as well, and what appeared to be a broken nose, and badly cut upper lip.Upper lip cut in \\"By Telegraph\\", The Daily Ogden Junction, Ogden, Utah, pg. 3, 27 September 1873 Spectators begged McCoole's seconds to take him out of the ring, and they soon did. Allen took the bareknuckle heavyweight championship of America, in only twenty minutes of fighting. Allen had proven he was a superior boxer to McCoole and that what most perceived as his superior performance in their previous meeting, was genuine. He later called Allen, the \\"most magnificent tactician I had ever seen\\", and considered the bout, \\"the hardest of my life\\". The fight became the greatest loss of McCoole's career as the title, in the view of many current boxing historians, was a world and not merely American heavyweight championship.Round by round coverage in \\"The Great Prize Fight\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 2, 24 September 1873\\"Tom Allen's Victim Dead\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 8, 27 February 1899 Charge of murder On 30 October 1873, McCoole was arrested outside his Saloon in St. Louis on a charge of murdering a lightweight boxer named Patsy Manley, with whom he was said to have been quarreling with in his Saloon on Washington Street. Manley had received a gunshot wound to his left breast. McCoole was jailed for a period of time after his arrest, but was later acquitted on 17 February 1875 as the prosecution could not find the principle witnesses to testify.\\"A Man Murdered\\", The Fort Wayne Journal Gazette, pg. 1, 31 October 1873 A sizable percentage of St. Louis residents still believed McCoole was guilty of the crime.\\"A Prizefighter Named Manley\\", The Perry County Democrat, Bloomfield, Pennsylvania, pg. 2, 5 November 1873\\"News of the Week\\", The Ohio County News, Hartford, Kentucky, pg. 2, 17 February 1875 Not long after his arrest, his brush with the law may have caused him to lose his Saloon in St. Louis from lack of patronage, and because he fell out of favor after his loss to Tom Allen. Allen operated a competing St. Louis saloon which saw more business after McCoole's loss. By 1879, McCoole had relocated to New Orleans, working for a period as a wharf laborer and on a Sugar Plantation.\\"Death of Pugilist McCoole\\", The Baltimore Sun, Baltimore, Maryland, pg. 6, 19 October 1886Coburn had a competing bar in \\"The Time When St. Louis was a Sporting\\", The Cincinnati Enquirer, Cincinnati, Ohio, pg. 7, 21 August 1878 As late as 1878, McCoole tried to set up a fight with Tom Kelly, but the fight never took place, as Kelly believed the $100 stake would not justify the time and effort it would take for him to complete his training.The New Orleans Daily, New Orleans, Louisiana, pg. 1, 19 November 1878 Work on the Mississippi Steamer USS Champion In his boxing retirement, McCoole continued to work as a wharf laborer and mate on steamboats, and worked occasionally on coal barges as well. He was aboard the steamboat Champion in 1864 when she was set on fire in Memphis during the Civil War. The Champion was hit by an incendiary device, starting a small fire. She returned to shore, while McCoole tied her up and waited for her crew and supplies to unload. He was a mate on the stern wheel packet freighter Florence Meyer when she was snagged and sunk on the Mississippi while loaded with cotton and other supplies, about 12 miles above Natchez, Mississippi near Bullett's Bayou, Louisiana in the early morning of September 25, 1880.Sunk on September 24 in \\"Mike McCoole Drowned\\", The Daily Gazette, Wilmington, Delaware, 30 September 1880Sunk near Natchez in \\"Latest News\\", La Plata Home Press, La Plata, Missouri, pg. 1, 2 October 1880Huddleston, Mary, (1998) Steamboats and Ferries, University of Arkansas Press, UCA Press, Fayetteville, Arkansas, pg. 91. At least four of the crew were lost in the accident. McCoole did not drown, as several newspapers reported, though he was washed overboard as the ship was sinking. After a struggle, he was able to grab on to a barrel and pull himself back aboard using a guard rope to wait for rescue.\\"Mike M'Coole\\", St. Louis Globe Democrat, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 3, 20 October 1880Aboard the Florence Meyer in Shelbina Democrat, Shelbina, Missouri, pg. 3, 27 October 1880Aboard the USS Champion and Florence Meyer in \\"Mike M'Coole\\", The Times Picayune, New Orleans, Louisiana, pg. 3, 18 October 1886 He worked aboard the steamer Yazoo off Louisiana as late as 1881, and as a fireman, shoveling fuel to the boiler, on the Earle, a New Orleans harbor boat.Fireman on the Earle in Memphis Daily Appeal, Memphis, Tennessee, pg. 3, 23 June 1881 In 1884, he worked as a fireman on the towboat Port Eads.Louisiana Capitolian, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, pg. 3, 8 November 1881Port Eads in The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, Louisiana, , pg. 6, 10 October 1884.

Russo (born October 22, 1975) is an American pianist. Russo was born in Syracuse, New York, and studied music in New York City and Europe. He started a nonprofit youth educational foundation in New York at the age of 25 and recorded albums in the 2000s. In 2005, Russo became director of music at Le Moyne College, where he works as an artist in residence. He was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for the 49th New York State Senate district in the 2010 state election. Early life and career Russo was born to a father of the same name who played baseball as a catcher for the Philadelphia Phillies. He is a native of Syracuse, New York, and graduated from Fayetteville-Manlius High School in 1993. Russo received his bachelor's and master's degrees from the Juilliard School in New York City and did post- graduate study in France and Germany. He participated in the Gina Bachauer International Piano Competition in 1998, returned to New York at the age of 25, and created Music Journeys Inc., a nonprofit youth educational foundation. Russo played in the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in 2001, and released Voice of the Whale, an album of songs by composer George Crumb, for the British label Black Box Records in 2002. Subsequent albums for Black Box, Corigliano: Violin Sonata; Etude Fantasy; Fantasia on an Ostinato; Chiaroscuro (2006), Aaron Jay Kernis: 100 Greatest Dance Hits (2007), Paul Schoenfield: Four Parables; Four Souvenirs; Caf√© Music (2007), and Mix Tape (2008) received positive reviews by Allmusic. Russo's 2007 album Dirty Little Secret for Endeavour Classics was favorably reviewed by Allmusic and The New York Times. Politics In November 2009, Russo announced his candidacy for the 49th New York State Senate district as a Republican in the 2010 state election. He had become a registered Republican on June 24, 2009 and was previously registered as a Democrat from 1995 to 2006, when he changed his registration to independent. The 49th Senate district is represented since 2005 by Democrat David Valesky. Russo named as his goals the implementation of term limits, the reduction of taxes, a spending freeze, and the removal of discretionary spending by individual senators. Russo attacked Valesky over his support for same-sex marriage and for \\"broken promises\\", \\"painful tax hikes\\", and \\"failed leadership\\". In December 2009, The Post-Standard reported that Russo had rarely voted since registering in 2001. Russo maintained he had voted in 2006 and 2008, and had failed to vote more often because he had lived outside of the country. Michael Long, chairman of the Conservative Party of New York State, stated on March 3, 2010, that Russo would be the Conservative Party candidate over of his Republican contender, East Syracuse mayor Danny Liedka. In May 2010, the Senate Republican Campaign Committee endorsed Russo over Liedka for the primary election. Russo won the primary election on September 14 and became the Republican and Conservative candidate. Russo sought to run on the Taxpayers Party of New York ballot line but New York State Board of Elections spokesman John Conklin stated on September 10, 2010, that too many of Russo's collected signatures were determined to be invalid for him to receive the line. Valesky's campaign staff criticized Russo afterwards for having \\"no clue who is in this senate district\\". In the general election, Valesky had a lead in early October in fundraising and opinion polling. Russo's campaign sought to portrait Valesky as a professional politician dependent on his party leadership and Valesky's campaign played up Russo's incomplete voting record and absence from the state. Russo's campaign publicly demanded Valesky return donation from Democratic State Senate leaders, whose names were included in a government report alleging unethical business dealings. Valesky's campaign in turn requested Russo return donations originating in the Seneca Nation of New York, which is suing New York over taxes on reservations. The candidates and their parties committed about two million dollars combined to the election, because the election could decide what party wins a majority in the New York State Senate. The Post-Standard on November 2, 2010, predicted the election to be close. Russo lost to Valesky. Personal life Russo lives in Fayetteville, New York,/> He is married to Natalia Chepurnova.

History  It was established by the Taih≈ç Code of early 8th century. The ministry was replaced in the Meiji period. The ministry was renamed Mombush≈ç for a brief number of years after 758, but the original name was restored in 764. The name has since remained unchanged until the Ritsury≈ç system was abandoned during the Meiji period. Shikibu-sh≈ç is also where the Lady Murasaki Shikibu derives her name, probably owing to the senior secretary post that her father and her husband once occupied in the ministry. It is also the origin of the name of Shikike, one of the four great branches of the Fujiwara clan. In the Edo period, titles related to the Shikibu-sh≈ç, such as , were largely ceremonial and could be held by non-kuge, such as daimy≈ç lords. Today's organisation is the Board of Ceremonies, a department of the Imperial Household Agency.  Name  The \\"Ministry of Ceremonial,\\" can arguably be considered the standard translation, as Japanologist Sir George Bailey Sansom wrote in 1932 that this was \\"the usual rendering in English\\", as well as being the coinage later adopted in the Appendix to Helen Craig McCullough's Eiga monogatari, which remains as the standard \\"followed by numerous English-language authors\\" according to a more recent assessment. However, Sansom issued the caveat that the use of the word \\"ceremony\\" is potentially misleading. Its function is not purely ceremonial, as will be discussed under the #Functions section. Given the dilemma, some commentators have chosen to apply an English name that attempted at a description of the true function, rather than a faithful literal translation. Further discussion, and a compilation of the numerous alternate English names are given in the section #List of translated aliases.  Functions  Sansom explains that Shiki actually denotes the \\"detailed procedure for the enforcement of ry≈ç (the administrative code, as in Ritsury≈ç)\\". For this reason, applying \\"the word 'ceremonial' is a little misleading\\" he warns. The minister, or the had the grave authority to grade the performances of civil officers, recommend their appointments and awards, and decide on their ceremonial seniorities and privileges.Ury, Marian.

Its plot follows three women who join the Women's Army Corps during World War II. The screenplay was written by George Bruce and Mary C. McCall, Jr. Filmed in Florida and Iowa in late 1944, Keep Your Powder Dry premiered in Washington, D.C. on March 6, 1945. It went on to become a financial success for its studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, earning $2.7 million against its $1.3 million budget. Plot Socialite Valerie \\"Val\\" Parks is informed that she is not eligible to claim her trust fund until she can demonstrate responsibility. In response, she decides to join the Women's Army Corps (WAC) to show she is a mature young woman. En route to the training camp in Des Moines, Iowa, she meets Ann Darrison, a housewife who chose to enlist in the WAC after her husband is deployed overseas; and Leigh Rand, the daughter of a military family. Val and Leigh, assigned to the same barracks, immediately clash, with Leigh acting bossily toward the servile Val. Ann attempts to remediate the tensions between Val and Leigh. During training, Val challenges Leigh's assumptions about her by working intensely and excelling in her courses. Upon completing basic training, Val, Ann, and Leigh are assigned to a Motor Transport school within the WAC. Val and Leigh eventually warm to each other, and together attempt to help the self-conscious Ann boost her confidence. Ultimately, all three women are accepted into the Officer's Candidate School. Bill Barclay, a peer of Ann's husband, visits the base and has Ann record herself speaking on a disc so he can bring it back to her husband overseas. At the base, Bill becomes enamored of Val, which results in jealousy from Leigh, who also finds Bill attractive. Leigh thwarts a potential date between the two by arranging Val to be assigned to duty, which angers Val. Some time later, Val receives a telegram from her attorney inviting her to meet him at a hotel, but upon arriving finds her friend Harriet, and a drunken Junior Vanderhausen, both people from her socialite circle. Harriet, who is living on Val's income, convinces Val to sign a lease for a home in Palm Beach, Florida. Angered by the two's dismissive attitude toward her endeavors in the WAC, Val criticizes them before Junior spills his drink on her uniform. Afraid of returning to the barracks reeking of alcohol, Val asks Leigh, who is also staying in the hotel on a weekend pass, to return to the barracks and occupy her bed so she is not absent from nightly inspection. Leigh agrees, and returns to the hotel in the morning to bring Val a clean uniform. In the hotel elevator, Leigh encounters Junior, who tells her Val only joined the military to claim her inheritance. Disgusted by what she perceives as Val's insincerity, Leigh embarks on a smear campaign against Val after she is appointed platoon commander. Two days prior to the graduation, Val finally stands up to Leigh, slapping her in the face. The women's commanding officer, Lt. Colonel Spottiswoode, subsequently informs Leigh that half of the platoon has ranked her unfit to fulfill her leadership position as she lacks empathy. Shortly after, Spottiswoode reluctantly informs Ann that her husband has been killed in combat. Ann and Leigh console one another, and Leigh admits to Ann that she has always been jealous of Val's beauty and commitment. Ann and Leigh visit Val at the hotel, and they reconcile. Leigh and Val implore Spottiswoode for permission to remain in the WAC as enlistees despite their recent transgressions. Convinced that both women are truly remorseful, Spottiswoode relents and allows them to graduate from the Officer's Candidate School alongside Ann. Cast Analysis Film scholar Yvonne Tasker notes that, while many war films of the mid-20th century are concerned with demonstrating women's capability in the military, Keep Your Powder Dry instead is \\"more preoccupied with picturing women's service as not only respectable but healthy and moral. Thus the film condenses its acknowledgment of skeptical men to a single sequence in which the recruits fix an incredulous general's new car.\\" Production Principal photography began August 28, 1944, and completed in November 1944. It was reported in August 1944 that cinematographer Richard Rosson shot backgrounds for the film at the Women's Army Corps training centers in Des Moines, Iowa and Fort Oglethorpe. Sgt. Art Moore of the U.S. Army Signal Corps Photographic Unit instructed 50 dancing girls for drill scenes featured in the film. Release =Box office= The film premiered in Washington, D.C. on March 6, 1945. It subsequently premiered in New York City on March 10, 1945. It later opened regionally in such cities as Amarillo, Texas on April 6. According to MGM records the film earned $1,892,000 in the US and Canada and $801,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $464,000. =Critical response= Kate Cameron of the New York Daily News awarded the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, though she felt it was ineffective at promoting the Women's Army Corps, noting that it \\"makes no attempt to show in what way the girls serve their country after leaving training camp, nor does it suggest how important they may become in the matter of relieving soldiers for active duty at the front.\\" E. B. Radcliffe of The Cincinnati Enquirer noted that \\"the producer has done right by the corps in the standard of pulchritude he has chosen to represent it,\\" but criticized its believability, noting that \\"two of the principal character are far-fetched and right out of [a] soap opera.\\" The San Francisco Examiners Hortense Morton noted it as \\"a strictly feminine film,\\" adding that, \\"while the story gets major treatment, the background of women in the Army, with its discipline, barracks life, and human elements, is shown with good purpose. The background is authentic.\\" References Sources * External links 1945 films American films American war drama films American black-and-white films 1940s war drama films English-language films Films shot in Florida Films shot in Iowa Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films World War II films made in wartime 1945 drama films ","title":"Keep Your Powder Dry"},{"id":"25060391","title":"1909 Newfoundland general election"},{"id":"25060396","text":"Union Sportive Jou√©-l√®s-Tours was a French football club founded in 1942.

When asked his marketing strategy he said, \\"I publish books I like and think other people will like to read.\\" While print on demand could be used by the traditional publishers, they are not set up for that business model, and thus cede the smaller volume publishing to companies such as Old Earth.

In 2009, Constable Butcher was awarded the Emergency Services \\"Pride of Australia\\" medal. He has also been awarded the Western Australia Police Star, Commissioner's Medal for Excellence and Western Australia Police Medal. Old Bailey incident On the evening of February 4, 2008, Matthew Butcher and several other police officers intervened in a fight at the Old Bailey tavern in Joondalup, Perth, opposite the Joondalup police station. One of the men involved, Robert McLeod (55) was shot by Constable Butcher with a Taser stun gun. Robert McLeod's son Barry (28), launched a flying headbutt at Constable Butcher as soon as his weapon was deployed resulting in Constable Butcher being knocked unconscious and falling to the ground, resulting in a broken cheekbone, broken jaw, and bleeding on the brain. The entire incident was captured on a mobile phone video camera from an onlooker. Constable Butcher was taken to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital for his injuries, where he was placed into an induced coma. Surgery was performed to remove swelling on his brain, however he sustained permanent brain injuries causing impaired motor control and vision. Constable Butcher was discharged from Royal Perth Rehabilitation Hospital in September 2008, however, he remains paralysed from the left side and has not been able to use his left arm since the incident. =Court case= Shortly after the incident, Robert McLeod and his two sons Barry and Scott were charged with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, assaulting a public officer, obstructing an officer and making threats to kill. In March 2009, a District Court jury found the accused not guilty of all charges relating to the assault on Constable Butcher. McLeod's lawyers argued the accused acted in self defence when confronted by police, who they said acted with excessive force as they attempted to arrest them. Aftermath The verdict resulted in an outcry from the WAPOL as well as the public. Several days after the verdict was handed down, 2000 people took part in a public rally on the steps of Parliament House in Perth, calling for tougher penalties for anyone who assaults a police officer. At this rally, Butcher's wife Katrina gave an address thanking the public for their support. In September 2009, the Upper House of the West Australian parliament passed new mandatory sentencing laws, which will result in a jail sentence for anyone found guilty of assaulting a public officer, including police. =Compensation= In January 2011, Matthew Butcher was compensated A$3.3 million from the West Australia government for continuing medical treatment, loss of earnings and trauma sustained by the incident. Robert Macleod filed a lawsuit against Butcher, claiming damages for \\"wrongful battery\\" relating to the police use of a Taser on him during his arrest. This action was withdrawn in 2015.

Performances as a contortionist Jacinto was a member of the Cirque du Soleil as one of four 12 to 14-year-old girls working in a contortionist troupe. Jacinto said that to perform as a contortionist \\"You just lie down on your stomach, bring your legs over your head, lift up your chest and you smile.\\" The four girls won a gold medal at the Festival Mondial Du Cirque De Demain in Paris in 1990. In the dance show Tono, put on by the Ontario-based Red Sky Performance at the Coups de th√©√¢tre festival, reviewer Kathryn Greenaway described her opening performance, which finished with Jacinto turning to \\"reveal a slender, elegant horse skull delicately balanced on her forearm\\" as \\"breathtaking\\". Choreographer Laronde said the casting of Jacinto was to \\"convey the otherworldliness of the shaman\\", continuing \\"when the shaman dreams, they often dream upside down, whereas normal people dream right-side up.\\" In 2004, Jacinto participated in an art installation by director Paulette Phillips entitled The Secret Life of Criminals. The piece was inspired by a police investigation into a woman's death.

It is a very simple tool that consists of a punch, die, and screw. There are three different drive systems: manual, ratchet, and hydraulic. Operation First a pilot hole is drilled slightly larger than the screw of the knockout punch. Then the die is placed on the screw and the screw is inserted into the pilot hole. The screw is then threaded into the punch and the screw tightened until the punch is drawn completely through the sheet metal. The manual system uses a screw that has a standard hex head or square head and is driven using an allen key or wrench. A manual knockout punch can handle holes from . The ratchet system has a custom ratcheting wrench that uses a ball screw to make the process faster and easier. This type of system has a mechanical advantage of approximately 220:1 and can punch holes up to in diameter in 10 gauge mild steel. A hydraulic system is much bulkier and heavier than the other systems but it is the easiest to use and can make holes up to in diameter. It is a two piece system where the dies are attached to the ram which is connected to the hydraulic unit via a flexible hose. Size families and shapes There are several sizing systems for these punches. The two most common are those sized for standard electrical knockout sizes and those that are for true dimensional holes. A 3/4 inch conduit size punch actually punches a hole that is approximately 1.1 inches diameter for 3/4 nominal size conduit. A dimensional size punch makes a hole very close to the indicated size. Punch sets are available on both imperial and metric sizes. Chassis punches are available in a number of shapes, round being the most common. Other shapes include square, hexagonal, and special shapes for thing such as holes with key tabs and D-sub connectors Special shapes often use bolts that are square or keyed and a separate nut on the punch end to ensure alignment of the punch and die.

LABI serves as the state chamber of commerce and manufacturing association. It was founded in Baton Rouge in 1976, when Louisiana adopted a new right-to-work law during the administration of Democratic Governor Edwin Washington Edwards. The previous law, passed in the 1950s during the Robert F. Kennon administration, was repealed in 1956 by the Louisiana State Legislature under Kennon‚Äôs successor, Earl Kemp Long. Teeming from its success with right-to-work, LABI quickly unified the state's business community into a visible, well-financed, fully staffed organization to speak for business year-round as well as during state legislative sessions. Its original long-term executive director was Edward J. Steimel of Baton Rouge, previously with the Public Affairs Research Council, a \\"good government\\" think tank. Education issues LABI has been extensively involved in education reform. In 1987, LABI issued the report \\"Ten Years of Education Reform in Louisiana: A Long Journey to Nowhere\\". Most reforms, LABI found, had been \\"watered down, ignored, not implemented properly, taken to court by the teacher unions and others, mired in turf battles, or not funded.\\" Similar reforms pushed by Governor Buddy Roemer in 1988 met the same opposition from particular constituency groups. LABI maintains that parents in effect must \\"pay twice\\" to obtain educational reform‚Äîtaxes for public schools and their own private tuition. LABI issues annual reports with numerical ratings of all state legislators, both for the current year and accumulative totals.

Background The canons regular trace their origins to the 4th century reforms of the clergy by Martin of Tours in France and Eusebius of Vercelli in Italy. They and other bishops sought to model the accepted lifestyles of their clergy in a domestic model, based on the communal pattern followed by the first Christians as depicted in the Acts of the Apostles. The premier example of this effort was the life and work of Augustine of Hippo, who himself lived as a monk before being called to take up the office of bishop for his North African city. He later wrote a small monastic rule to guide a community of women who wanted to live the monastic ideal. This document became the official guide for the earliest of the religious communities to emerge in the church in later centuries, in parallel to that of the Rule of St. Benedict. From this comes the title \\"regular\\", meaning one following a \\"rule\\" (Latin: regula). Under the guidance of Cardinal Hildebrand of Sovana (later to become Pope Gregory VII), the Lateran Synod of 1059 organized and recognized these developing communities and recommended them as the preferred pattern of clerical life, at a time when mandatory celibacy was being made a universal requirement for the clergy of the Roman Church. The Lateran Canons are descended from the Canons Regular of Santa Maria in Portu on the isle of Corizo near Ravenna, which is first mentioned in 1103. By the 15th century, the moribund community nearly slipped into extinction on account of the absence of leadership and direction that was a direct result of the practice of commendatory abbots, until finally in 1419 the community dwindled to just two: the prior and one canon. However, a pious aristocrat from Ravenna, Obizone, arranged a union between Santa Maria in Portu and the newly founded Canons Regular of Fregionaia. The Canons of Fegionaia were formed in 1402. In 1408 Gregory XII erected a chapter for three independent houses. In 1449 the Canons of Fregionaia welcomed the Canons Regular of the Holy Cross of Mortara, which had been founded in 1082 along one of the most important pilgrimage routes in Europe between Rome and Santiago de Compestella. Due to political instability and social unrest, the canons and their houses declined. The heart of the congregation had been Fregionaia, where the first reform canons lived. However, that changed when the canons were called to Rome in 1431 by Eugene IV, to take over the Basilica of St. John Lateran. In 1446, with the papal bull Cum ad sacratissimam, Eugene confirmed the position of the canons regular at the basilica and changed their name to the Canons Regular of the Lateran. History This congregation traces its roots to three ancient communities: The Congregation of the Most Holy Savior formed in 1419 by the union of the communities of the Canons of St. Mary of Reno in the region of Bologna with that of the Canons of St. Ambrose in Gubbio. The clergy serving the Lateran Basilica in Rome for much of the Middle Ages comprised a community with this title. \\"The Canons Regular of the Lateran\\", St. Monica's Priory, Spetisbury, Dorset They later left, to be replaced by secular canons in the 17th century. In general the canons did not do parish work per se. They were not parish priests. Rather they returned to more primitive apostolic work, especially that of popular preaching and catechesis. They also rendered spiritual guidance to lay organizations and houses of nuns, canonesses and other woman's communities as well as supporting hospitals, lazariums, free education for the poor and every kind of work of mercy. In 1823, following the devastation of many religious communities in the Napoleonic invasions, the survivors of these two congregations joined into this one congregation, at which time it acquired its present title. = In England = In the 12th century the Canons Regular of the Lateran, otherwise known as the Augustinian Canons, established a priory in Bodmin. Bodmin Priory became the largest religious house in Cornwall. It was suppressed on 27 February 1538 and the buildings were destroyed and despoiled; the persecuted Canons dispersed and disappeared from England altogether. After three hundred years, the Canons Regular of the Lateran returned to England, when in 1884 Dom Felix Menchini was constituted as Prior and Novice master of St. Mary's Priory, Bodmin. The Priory at Bodmin gained the status of an Abbey in 1953. The foundation stone of the present church was laid in 1937 but the war caused the building works to be delayed for many years, and it was not until 24 June 1965 that Bishop Restieaux consecrated the church. The Catholic Church in Cornwall was greatly aided by the Canons Regular, who founded the great majority of the present Catholic churches in Cornwall. Members of the community are buried in the Canons Regular cemetery in Bodmin on land adjacent to the church.\\"St. Mary's, Bodmin\\", The Catholic Parish of St. Mary and St. Petroc, Bodmin In 2010, the Archbishop of Birmingham, Bernard Longley asked the priests of the Canons Regular to live in the presbytery of St Michael's Church, Birmingham, and to serve the needs not just of the Polish and the English-speaking Catholics of the city. Archbishop Longley celebrated Mass on Saturday 27 April 2013 to consecrated the new altar with the Abbot General of the Canons Regular of the Lateran, Giuseppe Cipolloni, and the Provincial Superior of the Polish province of the Canons Regular of the Lateran, Marian Szczecina. Among notable canons was Abbot Giuseppe Ricciotti (1890‚Äì1964), who wrote on Scripture and ancient history. The canons' distinctive habit comprises a totally white cassock, sash, shoulder cape (mozzetta) and skull cap (zucchetto), identical to what the Pope wears as his daily attire.  Present  The congregation is based near the ancient Basilica of St. Peter in Chains, where the current Abbot General lives with the General Curia of the Order. Provinces exist in Argentina, Belgium, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the United States. It is a member of the Confederation of Canons Regular.

He was notable for his passion for racial equality in the Church and beyond. He also distinguished himself as a pastor, as both the youngest Methodist bishop and as the most senior United Methodist bishop, and as the one person more than any other responsible for the establishment of the Saint Paul School of Theology in Kansas City, MO.  Early ministry, education and ordination  Born December 11, 1907 in Cherryvale, Kansas, Frank earned a bachelor's degree from Kansas State Teachers College of Pittsburg in 1930. He earned his Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1932 from the Garrett Bible Institute, Evanston, Illinois. He was ordained a Deacon in the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1932, and an Elder in 1933. As a pastor, Frank served congregations throughout eastern Kansas. He served the First Methodist Church of Topeka for the eight years previous to his episcopal election. While at Topeka, his sermons were broadcast each Sunday and he wrote a weekly column for the Topeka Daily Capital newspaper. He was also a featured preacher on the nationally broadcast, Peabody Award winning The Protestant Hour radio program.  Saint Paul School of Theology  As a delegate to the 1956 General Conference of the Methodist Church, Frank led efforts to gain approval to establish a new seminary in Kansas City. Due to a shortage of Methodist clergy in the Midwest and Plains states, this location was selected. When classes began in 1959, Frank was chair of the School's Board of Trustees, continuing in that role until 1972. Former St. Paul President, the Rev. Lovett H. Weems, Jr., said \\"More than any one person, Bishop Frank is responsible for both the establishment of Saint Paul and setting its direction as a place for all God's people to prepare to lead.\\" Frank was still listed as a trustee of the school at the time of his death. Episcopal election and ministry The Frank was elected to the episcopacy at the 1956 General Conference of the Methodist Church. He was at the time the youngest bishop in the denomination. Following the death of Bishop Ralph Edward Dodge in 2008, Frank became the oldest bishop in the United Methodist Church. Frank was also the last Bishop to die of those elected in 1956 or before. Upon his election, Frank served as Resident Bishop of the Missouri episcopal area (1956‚Äì72) and of the Arkansas Area from 1972 until his retirement in 1976. Following retirement, he spent three years on the faculty of the Candler School of Theology at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1980 he returned to Missouri to serve as Bishop-in-Residence at the Central United Methodist Church (until 1988). Frank also held the distinction of the first President of the Council of Bishops of the United Methodist Church. Frank served 12 years on the Executive Committee of the World Methodist Council. He led the Commission on Public Relations and Methodist Information (a predecessor of the present United Methodist Communications). He also served on the General Board of Education and the General Committee on Family Life. Racial equality Frank was renowned for his passion for racial equality. During his tenure as bishop in Missouri, he oversaw the merger of the former African-American Southwest Missouri Annual Conference with the two predominantly white annual (regional) conferences in the State. He also witnessed the dissolution of the former African-American Central Jurisdiction, which accompanied the 1968 uniting of the Evangelical United Brethren and Methodist Churches. He saw this as evidence of a new Church that was forming. Emphases on race relations, increasing ministry in urban settings, and youth ministry, he said, indicated the new church had turned to encounter the realities of her mission. His family recalled at his Memorial Service how hard Frank worked for racial justice. He formed the Metropolitan Planning Commission in Kansas City to address racial equality, human rights and needs. As a result, an urban ministry program was developed that crossed all racial lines. Indeed, even late in retirement, Frank continued to speak on social issues. In November 2005, for example, he was among 96 U.M. Bishops who signed \\"A Call to Repentance and Peace with Justice\\" opposing the war in Iraq. In his final column in the Missouri Methodist newspaper (June 1972), he wrote, \\"War will never again be a way to settle arguments between nations.\\" Retired Bishop Fritz Mutti described Frank as \\"always unassuming, displaying great humility... He always worked to 'hold the church together.' I value his sense that, as he would put it, 'effective leadership came from the way you related.'\\" Death and funeral Frank died October 13, 2009 at the Kingswood Manor in Kansas City, Missouri. He was 101 years old. He was survived by his daughters and sons-in-law Wilmagene and Lewis Noonan of Leawood, Kansas and Susan and Mark Parsons of Ashbourne, Derbyshire in the U.K.; by a daughter, Gretchen Frank Beal of Knoxville, Tennessee, and son and daughter-in-law, Thomas E. Frank and Gail O'Day of Atlanta. Seven grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren also survived him. A memorial service was held at 11:00 a.m. on October 17, 2009 at the Central United Methodist Church of Kansas City. A private burial was held October 16 in Pittsburg, Kansas. In lieu of flowers, the family requested memorial contributions be made to the Eugene and Wilma Frank Scholarship Funds at either Saint Paul School of Theology or Candler School of Theology.

For much of his earlier career he fought just above the middleweight range, around 165-75, making him smaller than most of the heavyweights he met. Early life Allen was born on 1 April 1840 in Birmingham, England. By the age of 27, he had settled in America, having arrived with his greatest boxing adversary Mike McCoole in New York on 21 July 1867. Allen was a fast, scientific fighter and could deliver solid blows. He possessed considerable courage but sometimes did less well in long fights, lacking the durability to take lengthy punishment. =London Prize Ring rules= Under the English Broughton rules, if a man went down and could not continue after 30 seconds, the fight ended. Hitting a downed fighter and grasping or hitting below the waist were prohibited. Broughton invented and encouraged the use of \\"mufflers\\", a form of padded gloves, which were used in training and exhibitions. The advent of the Broughton rules around 1743 did allow fighters an advantage not enjoyed by modern boxers; a boxer could drop to one knee to start a 30-second count at any point in the match, but overuse of this privilege was frowned upon and sometimes disallowed by the judges. By 1870, when Allen began boxing in earnest, the Broughton Rules, had evolved into the slightly more civilized London Prize Ring Rules promulgated in 1843. Fine scientific boxing with a calculated defense involving feints with the arms and forward foot were rarely a feature of bare-knuckle boxing in the 1870s, nor necessary with the undisciplined nature of London Prize Ring Rules. These rules also outlawed head butting, holding the ropes, strangling, using resin, stones or hard objects in the hands, and biting. Other than gouging, hitting a man when he was down, kicking, or hitting or grabbing below the waist, most moves were permitted, including throwing a man down or holding him to inflict blows. Early boxing career highlights Fighting at a lighter weight on 2 June 1864 Allen lost in a battle for the welterweight championship of England to Bob Smith in a 50-round match at Widbury Isle. Some sources give the location as Wilbury Tole. It was Allen's first attempt at an English championship, and his only known attempt at a championship in the welterweight division. On 28 November 1865, Allen took the middleweight championship of England in a 41-round contest against Posh Price in Staffordshire, England. =Attempts at three championships, 1867= After several fights were stopped by Police, Allen and Joe Goss finally met on 5 March 1867 for the Middleweight championship of England in Gloucestershire. According to one account, Goss had a decided lead until the 34th round. Goss's right and Allen's left were somewhat disabled in the fighting, which caused the judges to end the fight in the 35th round in a draw.\\"Pugilism\\", The Illustrated Police News, London, Greater, London, pg. 4, 9 March 1867. According to one source, the purse was 400 English pounds per side.\\"The Allen-Gallagher Fight\\", St. Louis Globe, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 4, 18 August 1869 Allen lost to what many consider his most skilled opponent, Mike McCoole in an early career battle on 15 July 1869 at Foster's Island near St. Louis, for the heavyweight championship of America in a ninth round foul. Allen appeared to be nearly the equal of McCoole, the better known boxer, but lost the battle when the foul occurred. In the ninth round, McCoole and Allen clinched and fell rolling around the ring, when it appeared to the judges present that Allen gouged McCoole's eyes, a clear violation of the Broughton Rules. In the opinion of the New York Daily Herald, \\"Allen outfought McCoole all the way through and to all appearance would have won the fight if he had been allowed to proceed\\".\\"Pugilism\\", New York Daily Herald, New York, New York, pg. 10, 16 June 1869 Allen would face McCoole again with better results. A large fight broke out after the bout that included the use of clubs. In a title bout for the Heavyweight Championship of America on 17 August 1869, Allen drew with Charley Gallagher at \\"Foster's Island\\" near St. Louis, Missouri in eleven rounds. Allen knocked out Gallagher, but the referee called the contest a draw. The eighth was most decisive, with Allen landing repeated blows on Gallagher with little return. In a brutal fight, Gallagher was down in both the ninth and the tenth, and was down in the eleventh from a strong left blow to the mouth. Both boxers were injured, however, and both scored a number of blows, though the St. Louis Globe wrote that the match appeared decisively in Allen's favor, particularly after the seventh round. The Globe also noted that Gallagher's seconds had thrown up the sponge to indicate a knockout loss by their boxer, but that the referee chose to rule the fight a draw nonetheless.Match appeared to be in Allen's favor in \\"The Allen-Gallagher Fight\\", St. Louis Globe, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 4, 18 August 1869 =Heavyweight title attempt, 1870= Jem Mace On 10 May 1870, Allen was dealt a brutal ten round loss from well known middleweight boxer Jem Mace at Kennerville, Louisiana, before a substantial crowd of 2000, in a title bout for the heavyweight championships of both England and America. Allen's eyes were injured by the eighth, particularly the right one and he took more punishment in the round. Both men attempted to put the other in a headlock unsuccessfully, a strategy permissible by the lax London Prize Rules that governed the fight. By the tenth, Allen had taken too much punishment to stand long, particularly to his eyes, which were battered. At the end of the round Allen threw Mace to the ground, but Allen was the more injured and could not continue the match, his seconds throwing up the sponge. Allen's arm was badly injured or broken. Each contestant received a large purse of $2,500.\\"Fight Between Mace and Allen\\", New Orleans Republican, New Orleans, Louisiana, pg. 1, 11 May 1870. American Heavyweight champion, 1873 Heavyweight champion, Mike McCoole On the day before the championship fight against Allen and Mike McCoole near St. Louis, both boxers were arrested and required to post a bond of $1,000 to keep the peace.\\"Spoiling for a Fight\\", Ottawa Daily Citizen, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, 23 September 1873, pg. 4. Nonetheless, the fight took place the following day on 23 September 1873 with a seventh round win by Allen at Chouteau Island in Madison County, Illinois. Allen fought at 172, with a sixteen-pound weight disadvantage, and a three-inch disadvantage in height. The taller McCoole, who many historians considered the more awkward boxer, took the fiercer punishment in the first three rounds, with Allen opening a cut on his right eye, which he continued to pound. By the fourth round, McCoole was down for the first time, and a terrible site to behold. The fifth round saw additional punishment to McCoole, and in the final round Allen started off with several mighty blows to McCoole's face, soon ending the bout. McCoole had a terrible cut under his right eye with damage to his left eye as well, and what appeared to be a broken nose. Spectators begged McCoole's seconds to take him out of the ring, and they soon did. Allen took the bare-knuckle heavyweight championship of America, in only twenty minutes of fighting. Allen had proven he was a superior boxer to McCoole and that what most perceived as his superior performance in their previous meeting, was genuine. The title, in the view of many, was a world championship, and the greatest honor bestowed on Allen in his career.Round by round coverage in \\"The Great Prize Fight\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 2, 24 September 1873\\"Tom Allen's Victim Dead\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 8, 27 February 1899 Perhaps due partly to the number of spectators, and the high stakes involved, Allen was arrested two months later on the evening of 23 November for participating in the fight on a requisition from the Governor of Illinois.Seeking Allen's arrest in \\"Arrest of Prize Fighters\\", Chicago Tribune, Chicago, Illinois, pg. 2, 24 November 1873 On 18 November 1873, Allen drew with Ben Hogan for the Heavyweight championship of America in three rounds at Pacific City, Iowa. A few reports credited Allen with a win, but actually only three rounds were fought and a fight broke out.\\"Crimes and Casualties\\", The Salem Monitor, Salem, Missouri, pg. 1, 29 Nov 1873 Losing championship, 1876 Allen in later life, circa 1897 On 7 September 1876, Allen lost the Heavyweight championship of America to Joe Goss in 34 rounds in Boone County, Kentucky, taking one hour and fourteen minutes. The first seven rounds were fought in Kenton County, Kentucky and ruled a draw. Each side collected $5,000. Many considered the title Allen fought for a world and not just an American title, and most boxing historians today consider the title a heavyweight world title. According to one source, a foul caused when Allen struck Goss when he was down in the 14th, turned the decision in favor of Goss. Some dispute occurred as to whether the blow was deliberate. Several newspaper accounts seemed to agree with Allen that he had the better of the fight and was winning when the foul occurred.Allen was winning against Goss in \\"The Campaign Spirit\\", The Spirit of Democracy, pg. 3, 12 September 1876 Allen claimed to have won the bout, and stated \\"It seems to me that I cannot get fair play in this country, and I now say I will never again enter the ring\\". Allen was arrested briefly after the match, as boxing was illegal in Kentucky. Goss was later arrested on September 16 in New York.\\"After the Battle\\", \\"Joe Goss Arrested\\", The Cincinnati Enquirer, Cincinnati, Ohio, pg. 8, 9 September 1876Goss arrested in The Cincinnati Daily Star, Cincinnati, Ohio, pg. 1, 16 September 1876\\"Fight for the Championship of the World\\", New York Daily News, New York, New York, pg. 3, 8 September 1876 According to one account, Allen skipped bail to head to England to seek fights, and spend time at the racetracks. English heavyweight champion 1877-8 Allen defeated Tompkin Gilbert on Oct 29 1877, in London, England, for the Heavyweight Championship of Britain, in a seventh-round technical knockout. Gloves and the more modern Queensbury Rules of boxing, adopted widely in 1865, were used in the match. While still in England, on 4 April 1878, Allen fought Charley Davis to for the heavyweight Championship of Britain in Cambridge, England, before a substantial crowd of 2000, winning on a foul in five rounds. In a welcome change of events, gloves were used in the match, the newer Queensbury rules were followed for the first time in a championship match, and a British 200 pound prize was offered.The Arena, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 3, 26 January 1878 Allen had a five-inch height advantage, and Davis was down in the first not long after a terrific blow to the neck. The fourth was fought viciously on both sides with blood streaming from Allen's nose, but equal damage being done to Davis, who went down after four minutes of fighting, ending the round. Davis finally went down in the fifth from a terrific right to his eye which ended the bout, and though Davis's supporters rushed into the ring claiming foul, the decision was for Allen.\\"The Tom-Allen Davis Fight\\", The Cincinnati Enquirer, Cincinnati, Ohio, pg. 4, 6 April 1878 =Vacating English championship= In his last professional fight, Allen again fought for the Heavyweight championship of England and a 400-pound purse against Jem Stewart on 22 April 1879 in London. The bout resulted in a 24-round draw and was fought with gloves using Queensbury Rules. The fighting was not brutal, lacking heavy blows to the disappointment of many spectators, until the seventeenth when Allen appeared to have a slight advantage. A large crowd attended, including several members of the aristocracy. Allen relinquished the Heavyweight Championship of Britain.\\"The Allen-Stewart Prize Fight\\", The New Orleans Daily, New Orleans, Louisiana, pg. 1, 23 April 1879 Boxing retirement, and death Allen was back in America by 1878, and in New York issued a challenge to fight the great John L. Sullivan, though the fight never took place. When he returned to the United States, his lawyer successfully argued for his release from the bond posted as a result of his arrest after his fight in Kentucky. Between 1881-1886, Allen fought several exhibition fights which helped earn him income, but were not professional bouts. By around 1886, he had retired from all forms of boxing. By 1899, Allen operated \\"Champion's Rest\\", a Saloon on Market Street, in St. Louis. He was in custody on 27 February 1899 for the murder of a Tom Coupry four days earlier at his Saloon. Allen claimed self defense. Believing Coupry was about to shoot him, he pulled his revolver and fired first.\\"Tom Allen Under Arrest\\", Buffalo Evening News, Buffalo, New York, pg. 13, 27 February 1899 Allen was eventually released on bond, and continued to operate his Saloon, the site of several crimes and assaults in the following years.\\"Tom Allen's Victim Dead\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 8, 27 February 1899St. Louis Globe, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 12, 1 March 1899 Allen died on April 5, 1903, at the Baptist Sanitarium in St. Louis, Missouri, at the age of 62, and was buried at St. Louis's Bellefontaine Cemetery.

Its central region of Pelagonia, with the city of Prilep, was held by lord Vuka≈°in Mrnjavƒçeviƒá, who in 1365 became Serbian king and co-ruler of Serbian emperor Stefan Uro≈° V (1355-1371). After king Vuka≈°in died at the Battle of Maritsa in 1371, the realm was obtained by his son and designated successor (rex iunior) Marko Mrnjavƒçeviƒá, who took the title of Serbian king. At that time, capital cities of the Serbian realm were Skopje and Prizren, but during the following years king Marko lost effective control over those regions, and moved his residence to Prilep. He ruled there until his death in the Battle of Rovine in 1395. By the end of the same year, the Realm of late King Marko was conquered by Ottoman Turks. History Since 1334, the city of Prilep was under Serbian rule and the surrounding region was held by Serbian feudal lord Vuka≈°in Mrnjavƒçeviƒá, who was crowned the king of the Serbs and Greeks in 1365 as the co-ruler of last Serbian emperor Stefan Uro≈° V. After the death of both Vuka≈°in and Uro≈° in 1371, Vuka≈°in's son Marko Mrnjavƒçeviƒá, who held the title of \\"Junior King\\" (rex iunior), became the sole legal ruler of the Serbian Realm and took the title of Serbian king, but his power was contested by other Serbian feudal lords who gained control over other regions leaving Marko only with the areas in western half of Vardarian Macedonia, centered in Prilep. King Marko remained effective ruler only in the region of Prilep, and was also nominally recognized by some other feudal lords in surrounding areas. All of them, including king Marko, were forced to pay tribute to invading Ottoman Turks. Since he became a vassal of the Turkish Sultan, Marko Mrnjavƒçeviƒá was obligated to answer to the sultan's call in 1395 and take part in the Battle of Rovine where he was killed. The Turks took the opportunity to conquer the region of Prilep, adding its territory to the Sanjak of Ohrid. Since Marko, who styled himself as Serbian King, did not reduce his title to Prilep or any other local town or region, historians have used various terms for his domain. In Serbian historiography, it is called simply: the Lordship of King Marko () or the Domain of King Marko (). In some other historiographies, it is sometimes called the Realm of Prilep (Macedonian and ).

In 1940 he escaped the German occupation of Czechoslovakia and became a Flight Lieutenant in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. He flew a Hawker Hurricane with No. 242 Squadron RAF until he was shot down over German- occupied France in 1941. Bryks was a prisoner of war for four years, in which time he escaped and was recaptured three times. After his third escape he served in the Polish Home Army in Warsaw, where he helped to get supplies to Jewish resistance fighters in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. After his third recapture Bryks was moved to Stalag Luft III where he helped in The Great Escape, and then to Oflag IV-C in Colditz Castle, where he remained until it was liberated by the US Army in 1945. In 1948 the United Kingdom made Bryks an MBE for his escape attempts and for helping others to escape. In 1945 Bryks returned to Czechoslovakia and his Czechoslovak Air Force career. He was promoted to Major in 1946 but after the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'√©tat the Communists purged Bryks and many other officers who had served in Free Czechoslovak units under French or UK command. In 1949 the Communists sentenced Bryks to 10 years in prison and stripped him of his rank and medals. In 1950 20 years' hard labour and a heavy fine were added to his original sentence. In 1952 he was moved to a prison where he was forced to work in a uranium mine. Bryks died of a heart attack in a prison hospital in 1957. Bryks was posthumously rehabilitated after the 1989 Velvet Revolution ended the Communist dictatorship. Early life Josef Bryks was born in 1916 in La≈°≈•any, a village about northeast of Olomouc in Moravia. His parents Franti≈°ek and Anna (n√©e Nesvetrov√©) were farmers. Bryks was the seventh of eight children, but only four survived to adulthood. Bryks studied at the Commercial Academy in Olomouc and passed his Matura (final exam of secondary education) in June 1935. In October 1935 Bryks joined the Czechoslovak Army. He started his service in a cavalry regiment in Ko≈°ice. At the same time he studied at a school for cavalry officers in Pardubice until July 1936. From October 1936 to August 1937 he was trained at the Military Academy in Hranice, where he transferred from the cavalry to the air force. He was promoted to lieutenant and specialized as an aerial observer. After his training he was posted to the 5th Observation Squadron of the 2nd \\"Dr Edvard Bene≈°\\" Aviation Regiment, stationed in Prague. From October 1937 he was trained as a pilot in Prostƒõjov. On 30 September 1938 he graduated and was posted to the 33rd Fighter Squadron at Olomouc, where he flew Avia B-534 fighter aircraft. Bryks flew an Avia B-534 fighter with the 33rd Fighter Squadron On the same day as Bryks qualified as a fighter pilot, the United Kingdom and France signed the Munich Agreement that forced Czechoslovakia to cede the Sudetenland to Nazi Germany. On 15 March 1939 Germany occupied the remainder of Bohemia and Moravia and the resulting Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was forced to dissolve its army and air force. In the meantime Bryks' girlfriend, Marie ƒåern√°, became pregnant. On 18 April 1939 Bryks and ƒåern√° got married and her father, a butcher, gave Bryks a job as his assistant. The baby, a daughter, died two days after being born. Until the German Invasion of Poland Bryks secretly helped Czechoslovak pilots to escape to Poland. In December 1939 Bryks got a job as a civil servant at the Ministry of the Interior, but after three days he resigned. Second World War =Escape from the Reich Protectorate= On 20 January 1940 Bryks escaped from Bohemia and Moravia. He passed illegally through Slovakia and into Hungary. He was arrested in Hungary on 26 January and held in jail in Budapest until 4 April, when he was extradited to Slovakia. He escaped, went through Hungary again, reached Yugoslavia, and on 17 April 1940 he reported to the French Consulate in Belgrade. From there Bryks travelled through Greece and Turkey to French-ruled Syria, where he embarked on a ship to France. The ship reached France on 10 May, the day Germany began its invasion of France, The Netherlands and Belgium. Bryks and other Czechoslovak Air Force personnel were sent to Agde on the coast of Languedoc. But the Arm√©e de l'air was fully occupied resisting the German advance and repeatedly having to retreat to different airfields. It had neither the instructors, equipment nor time to retrain the Czechoslovaks to operate French aircraft. On 22 June France surrendered and on 27 June Bryks was evacuated by ship. =Royal Air Force 1940‚Äì41= Bryks reached Britain, where he was commissioned into the RAF Volunteer Reserve as a Pilot Officer. He was retrained at RAF Cosford in Shropshire, where he learnt to fly the Hawker Hurricane. On 4 August he was posted to the recently formed No. 310 Squadron RAF, which was the RAF's first squadron formed of exiled Czechoslovak personnel. However, on 17 August he was posted for further fighter training with No. 6 Operational Training Unit at RAF Sutton Bridge in Lincolnshire. Then on 1 October Bryks was posted to No. 12 Operational Training Unit at RAF Benson in Oxfordshire, which taught light bomber aircrew. On 11 November he was posted to the Headquarters Ferry Pool at RAF Kemble in Gloucestershire, which worked with the non-combatant Air Transport Auxiliary. On 1 January 1941 he was transferred to No. 6 Maintenance Unit at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire as a test pilot. Hurricane pilot with 242 Squadron Hurricane Mk IIb fighters in formation over Essex in 1941 On 23 April 1941 Bryks was at last posted to a combat squadron. He spoke good English thanks to his secondary school studies in Olomouc. He was posted not to one of the RAF's Czechoslovak squadrons but to No. 242 Squadron RAF, which was commanded by Douglas Bader and had a large Canadian contingent. At the time it flew Hurricane Mk IIb aircraft as night fighters, so Bryks was trained in night flying and navigation. When Bryks joined 242 Squadron it was based at RAF Stapleford Tawney in Essex. While he was with the squadron it was transferred to RAF North Weald, also in Essex. Bryks became friends with a WAAF, Gertrude \\"Trudie\\" Dellar, who was the widow of an RAF pilot. A formation of Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters 242 Squadron's r√¥le was changed to Circus offensives over German-occupied Europe, escorting RAF bombers with the purpose of drawing a Luftwaffe fighter attack. On 17 June 1941 the squadron took part in Circus 14. This was a late afternoon attack on Lille in northern France by 23 Bristol Blenheim bombers of 18, 105 and 110 Squadrons escorted by 19 Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires. A large force of Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters from I, II and III/Jagdgeschwader 26 led by flying ace Lt Col Adolf Galland plus Bf 109s from III/Jagdgeschwader 2 attacked the formation, shooting down 13 of the 40 RAF aircraft that took part. The RAF raiders managed to shoot down only three Bf 109s. One of these was downed by Bryks, but then three Bf 109s attacked his Hurricane, hitting its fuel tank and setting it afire. Bryks suffered burns to his face and ankle and his cockpit filled with smoke. He bailed out at an altitude of , about west of Saint-Omer- en-Chauss√©e, losing one of his flying boots as he did so. =Prisoner of war 1941‚Äì45= Bryks landed safely and started to bury his parachute. Frenchmen who had seen him descend gave him a civilian coat to hide his RAF uniform and told him to come to a safe house in a nearby hamlet. Bryks hid in a barn until nightfall, then went to the hamlet where he asked at a house for a doctor to treat his burns. The occupants betrayed him by calling the Germans, but when Bryks heard their motorised patrol coming he fled the house and hid in a garden. The patrol caught him, beat him up and took him to St Omer. The Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was subject to Nazi Germany, whose authorities deemed anyone from the Protectorate who served in Allied forces to be a traitor. He could therefore be executed and his family would suffer reprisals. Therefore, Bryks assumed the identity of \\"Joseph Ricks\\", born in 1918 in Cirencester, a Gloucestershire market town about from where he had been spent two months at RAF Kemble. But when he was shot down Bryks was wearing the Mae West lifejacket of a Polish colleague from 242 Squadron, F/O Henry Skalsky. Therefore, the Germans who questioned him at St Omer suspected he was Polish, and sent him to Dulag Luft at Oberursel in Hesse for interrogation by a Polish-speaking German officer. There he was accused of shooting a Luftwaffe fighter pilot who was parachuting from his Bf 109 in the air battle near St Omer on 17 June. For this he was threatened with being court-martialled in Berlin. After the war no such shooting was found in German records for that day. The accusation seems to have been a false one to put pressure on Bryks. Spangenberg castle in Hesse, where Bryks was held in Oflag IX-A/H from June to October 1941 On 22 June Bryks was transferred from Dulag Luft to Oflag IX-A/H in Spangenberg castle in Hesse-Nassau. Here he advised the Senior British Officer (SBO), Maj Gen Victor Fortune, of his true identity. Fortune knew the threat to Czechoslovak pilots in captivity, and supported Bryks' assumed identity. And via the Red Cross Bryks, posing as \\"Joseph Ricks\\", started writing to Gertrude Dellar. Escape from Oflag VI-B On 8 October 1941 Bryks was transferred to Oflag VI-B at D√∂ssel in Westphalia. There again he advised the SBO of his true identity. The PoWs' Escape Committee authorised a team of four men, including Bryks, to dig a escape tunnel through frozen clay. On the night of 19/20 April 1942 three Poles and three Czechoslovaks escaped through the tunnel in pairs. Bryks was one of them, paired with a fellow Czechoslovak, Flt Lt Otakar ƒåern√Ω. Otokar ƒåern√Ω in 1946 Bryks and ƒåern√Ω aimed to reach Switzerland. Around midnight on 28 April ƒåern√Ω was recaptured near Marburg in Hesse-Nassau, but Bryks was not caught. Near Giessen in Hesse-Darmstadt he stole a bicycle. He passed Offenbach am Main. A German guard shot at him as he crossed a bridge near Stuttgart in W√ºrttemberg. After this, short of food and water, Bryks fell ill with dysentery. He hid in a wood near Eberbach in Baden. There on 31 April a group of Hitler Youth captured him. Bryks had been on the run for 11 days and had travelled south from D√∂ssel before being caught. On 5 May 1942 he was taken to Darmstadt and held by the Gestapo. He was returned to Oflag VI-B at D√∂ssel where he was treated in the camp's infirmary from 8 May to 10 June. Escape from Oflag VI-A By 20 July 1942 Bryks had been transferred to Oflag VI-A near Soest in Westphalia. From 12 August he was held in solitary confinement, but fellow-prisoners smuggled razor blades to him hidden inside bread. With these he cut a hole in the wooden floor of his cell and tunnelled to the German quarters. On 17 August he escaped through the tunnel, wearing only pyjamas, a sweater and a blanket. Again Bryks headed south. About south of Frankfurt he found a Luftwaffe airfield where Bf 109 night fighters were based. He planned to steal one and fly to Britain, until a patrol with guard dogs approached. He fled and waded along a river to put the dogs off the scent. He reached Mannheim in Baden, where on the night of 8 September he was captured by German air defence troops who handed him to the local Gestapo. He had been on the run for 22 days and once again had travelled south before being caught. Bryks was returned to Oflag VI-B again but soon afterwards he and other RAF PoWs were transferred to Oflag XXI-B at Szubin in German- occupied Poland. There he told the SBO, Wg Cdr Harry Day, of his true identity. Escape from Oflag XXI-B On 4 March 1943 Polish workers in the camp helped Bryks and a British officer, Sqn Ldr Morris, to escape. The pair hid in a sewage tank that was mounted on a cart to empty the camp's latrines, wearing masks to try to protect them from the sewage. Members of the secret Armia Krajowa (\\"Home Army\\" or AK) hid them in a farmhouse .There they met Flt Lt ƒåern√Ω, who had escaped via a tunnel the night before. Their plan was to travel via Warsaw to Danzig, and there board a ship to neutral Sweden. Morris fell ill but Bryks and ƒåern√Ω set off on foot. In three weeks they covered the to Warsaw, where on 6 April they reported to an address that the AK had given them. Bryks assumed a Polish identity, calling himself \\"Josef Brdnisz\\". He and ƒåern√Ω spent four weeks in Warsaw disguised as a pair of stove fitters and chimney sweeps. They drove a horse and cart around Warsaw, supplying arms to resistance groups and bringing in food from the countryside. On 19 April Jewish resistance groups began the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Bryks and ƒåern√Ω helped to smuggle weapons and food to the rebels. The Germans crushed the ghetto uprising on 16 May. Pawiak prison in Warsaw, where Bryks and ƒåern√Ω were tortured for two months A fortnight later Bryks and ƒåern√Ω were lodging with a Polish widow, Mrs B≈Çaszkiewiczow√°, who had two young children and lived in a village several kilometres outside Warsaw. A collaborator told the German authorities, so on 2 June 1943 the Gestapo surrounded Mrs B≈Çaszkiewiczow√°'s house and arrested everyone inside. They took Bryks, ƒåern√Ω and Mrs B≈Çaszkiewiczow√° to Pawiak prison, and hanged Mrs B≈Çaszkiewiczow√° for helping enemy pilots. Bryks and ƒåern√Ω were interrogated, beaten and threatened with execution. On 5 June a Scharf√ºhrer called Grunnem kicked Bryks in the stomach, beat him about the head and left him unconscious. The Gestapo held him for 63 days. He suffered ruptured intestines and a punctured eardrum. Bryks was sentenced to death for helping the AK, but the sentence was commuted. Bryks was then taken to Stalag Luft III, near Sagan in Lower Silesia. The camp's SBO, Gp Capt Herbert Massey, sent a medical report to the UK authorities. On 10 October 1943 Bryks was transferred to the British military hospital at Stalag VIII-B in Upper Silesia. He underwent surgery on 7 November and was returned to Stalag Luft III on 23 December. Stalag Luft III and the Great Escape Months before Bryks was first sent to Stalag Luft III, preparations had been started for a mass escape of 200 PoWs, now commemorated as The Great Escape. Bryks joined in the preparations, which included completing a long tunnel code named \\"Harry\\". On the night of 23/24 March 1944 \\"Harry\\" was completed, and PoWs started leaving through it in pairs. Bryks was one of the men listed to escape, but before his turn came the guards discovered the tunnel exit just outside the perimeter fence. Only three days later, on 27 March, Bryks and an RAAF officer, Gp Capt Douglas Wilson, tried to escape. Guards saw them and opened fire, so the pair surrendered and were put in solitary confinement. Unmasked and interrogated Petschek Palace in Prague, the Gestapo headquarters where Bryks was held and interrogated In July 1944 the RAF promoted Bryks to Flight Lieutenant. Unfortunately the official letter sent from the UK via the Red Cross to tell Bryks of his promotion revealed his real name and nationality. The Gestapo interrogated Bryks, told him his family in Bohemia and Moravia had been arrested and that he would be executed for treason. On 1 September 1944 he was brought to a Gestapo headquarters in Petschek Palace in Prague. In due course he was also held at Pankr√°c Prison and Loreta military prison. 23 other Czechoslovak members of the RAFVR were also being held in these prisons. They were repeatedly interrogated and told that under German military law they were traitors and would be executed. Through the Red Cross the UK Government was told that Germany was threatening to execute the Czechoslovak airmen. The United Kingdom replied through the same channel. As the Czechoslovak airmen were UK armed forces personnel, the UK demanded that Germany afford them the same rights and protections as any other PoWs from the UK. And Winston Churchill threatened that if Germany executed any of them, the Allies would execute 10 Luftwaffe airmen for each Czechoslovak killed. Germany did not revoke the threat of execution, but the Gestapo did return the Czechoslovaks to PoW camps. On 22 September 1944 Bryks was brought to Stalag Luft I near Barth in Western Pomerania. Oflag IV-C, Colditz Castle and liberation In his last six months as a PoW Bryks was held at Oflag IV-C in Colditz Castle in Saxony Because of his injuries from Gestapo interrogations, Bryks appeared before an international medical board on 6 November. The board deemed that he should be repatriated to the UK on medical grounds, but the German authorities refused because he was still accused of treason. The next day he was moved to Oflag IV-C at Colditz Castle in Saxony. This was a high-security prison for PoWs who had repeatedly escaped from other camps. There he remained until the United States Army liberated the camp on 16 April 1945. Bryks was returned to RAF Cosford in England to recover from his captivity and Gestapo torture. He learnt that his wife Marie in Czechoslovakia had divorced him in his absence, had remarried, and in April 1945 had committed suicide. After Germany surrendered in May 1945 Bryks went to see Gertrude Dellar and proposed to her. They were married on 18 June. In August 1945 Bryks underwent further surgery for injuries from his Gestapo interrogation. In June 1946 he had surgery to remove a piece of shrapnel that had been embedded in the floor of his mouth when he was shot down in June 1941. In Czechoslovakia from 1945 Trudie and Josef Bryks in Olomouc in 1947 On 6 October 1945 Bryks returned to Czechoslovakia and his second wife Gertrude came with him. He resumed his Czechoslovak Air Force career but his injuries, and particularly his hearing loss, prevented him from continuing as a pilot. He was posted to the Military Aviation Academy at Olomouc, where he taught English and the theory of flight. He was promoted to Captain in September 1945, Staff Captain in December 1945 and Major in May 1946. (search for \\"Bryks\\") Also in 1946, Gertrude bore Bryks a daughter, Sonia. In April 1946 Ealing Studios released Basil Dearden's film drama The Captive Heart. In it Michael Redgrave is a Czechoslovak officer based on Bryks, Rachel Kempson is a young widow based on Gertrude Dellar, and Basil Radford is the PoW camp's Senior British Officer (SBO) who protects the Czechoslovak officer. =Persecution= Bryks' air force career continued while a democratic coalition ruled the Third Czechoslovak Republic. But in February 1948 the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSƒå) seized power in the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'√©tat. Bryks was deemed \\"politically unreliable\\" and on 9 March was sent on enforced leave and transferred to the military reserve force. His political opinions made his superior officer Colonel V√°clav Fuksa to write that Bryks was \\"untrustworthy for his political irresponsibility and for the lack of understanding of the ideology of People's Democracy\\". Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) medal The UK Government informed Bryks that he was to be made a Member of Order of the British Empire (MBE) in recognition of his escapes as a PoW and the help he gave to other escapees. He was invited to Buckingham Palace in London to be decorated. But the Communist authorities refused to grant him a visa to leave Czechoslovakia. Therefore, the UK Ambassador to Czechoslovakia presented Bryks with his MBE at the UK Embassy in Prague. =Three trials= Just after midnight on the night of 2‚Äì3 May 1948 the StB secret police arrested Bryks at his home in Olomouc. He was charged with involvement in an alleged attempt by other former RAF airmen, including Air Marshal Karel Janou≈°ek, to escape to the West. Bryks was court- martialled in Prague between 14 and 16 July 1948 and was found not guilty, because Communists did not yet control these courts. But the prosecutor appealed and Bryks remained in prison. Bryks was retried on 2 September 1949. By now the Communists controlled the courts. He was found guilty and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment. He was stripped of his rank and medals and expelled from the air force. His wife obtained an exit visa for herself and their young daughter, stating that it was to pay her parents in England in short visit. In fact she left Czechoslovakia for the duration of the Communist era, and did not return until 2009. Bryks as a prisoner in Bory prison in Plze≈à in 1949 After his conviction Bryks was held first in Pankr√°c, in the same prison where the Gestapo had held him in 1944. On 17 August 1949 he was transferred to Bory prison in Plze≈à. On 18 April the prison authorities announced that they had uncovered a plan for a prison uprising and mass escape. Bryks was among those accused of the allaged plot. He was tried on 11 May 1950 and found guilty. His sentence was extended with 20 years' hard labour and he was fined Kƒçs 20,000. His wife protested to the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Rudolf Sl√°nsk√Ω, but got no answer. The entrance to Leopoldov Prison, where Bryks was held from June 1952 On 6 November 1950 Bryks was transferred to a prison at Opava in Czech Silesia. There other former RAF political prisoners included Karel Janou≈°ek. Bryks was insubordinate and resisted the prison authorities. On 18 June 1952 he was transferred to Leopoldov Prison, a converted 17th-century fortress in Slovakia. There he continued to resist the prison authorities, and he was again accused of planning to escape. =Uranium mine and death= Finally he was moved to a prison in Ostrov nad Oh≈ô√≠ in western Bohemia and made to work in a uranium mine called Rovnost (The Czech word for \\"Equality\\"). Here prisoners were paid a small wage for their work. Bryks worked hard, exceeding his work quotas, and sent his wage to help support his sick father and his wife and daughter. But in December 1955 the Communists banned Bryks from sending money to his family. Interior Ministry note dated 12 August 1957 recording Bryks' death Bryks resumed his resistance of prison authorities, but his health worsened. On 11 August 1957 he suffered a massive heart attack. He died in the prison hospital at Ostrov nad Oh≈ô√≠. The Communist authorities notified his wife in England by a brief telephone call, in which they gave her no further details. Bryks' remains were not released to his family. The Communists secretly cremated him. Eight years later, in 1965, they buried his ashes in a cemetery in the Motol district of Prague. Rehabilitation and monuments Bryks was rehabilitated after the November 1989 Velvet Revolution. On 29 May 1991 the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic posthumously promoted Bryks to Colonel. A memorial plaque to him in front of the local war memorial at his birthplace in La≈°≈•any was unveiled on 4 June 1994. Memorial plaque to Josef Bryks in his birthplace Bƒõlkovice-La≈°≈•any, unveiled in 1994. Part of the Czech inscription reads: Josef Bryks was a patriot with precious courage. His legacy lives in the hearts of everybody, who esteem freedom, democracy and human dignity. In 2004 Bryks was honoured with the \\"Award of the City of Olomouc\\" for \\"bravery and courage during the Second World War\\". A memorial plaque was unveiled outside 5 Han√°ck√©ho pluku, Olomouc, where Bryks was living with his wife and daughter when the StB arrested him in 1948. In 2006 a court in Prague finally exonerated him of his false convictions. On 28 October 2006 the Czech Republic gate Bryks its highest award, the Order of the White Lion, military division, 2nd class. In 2007 the Czech television made a documentary film Mu≈æ, kter√Ω p≈ôecenil ƒçeskou du≈°i aneb √ötƒõky Josefa Brykse (English: \\"A Man Who Overestimated the Czech Soul\\" or \\"Escapes of Josef Bryks\\"). The film includes an interview with his widow Gertrude. In 2008 the Czech Republic posthumously promoted Bryks to Brigadier General. Two streets are named after Bryks: one in the ƒåern√Ω Most suburb of Prague and the other in Slavon√≠n on the edge of Olomouc. In 2007 ƒåesk√° televize made a documentary about Bryks, Mu≈æ, kter√Ω p≈ôecenil ƒçeskou du≈°i aneb √ötƒõky Josefa Brykse (\\"The Man Who Overestimated the Czech Soul or The Escapes of Josef Bryks\\"). In 2009 two historians found out about the secret burial in Motol in 1965 of the urn containing Bryks' ashes. With this information, his British widow Gertrude Bryksov√° was able to visit his grave, 52 years after his death. Honours and awards A Czechoslovak War Cross 1939‚Äì1945. Bryks was awarded this decoration three times. Bryks was awarded numerous UK and Czechoslovak honours. UK honours: * Member of Order of the British Empire (MBE) * 1939‚Äì1945 Star * Air Crew Europe Star * War Medal 1939‚Äì1945.

A close associate and friend of the famous Pakistani nuclear engineer Munir Ahmad Khan (late), he is citizen of both Pakistan and Germany. He is one of the European scientists who participated in Project-706 in the 1970s. Finke is, perhaps, better known in much of the world for his involvement in the development of Beryllium reflector technology as well as selling this technology to Pakistan in the late 1980s. In 1989, Finke was arrested in Germany by the Interpol Police because of his involvement in nuclear proliferation. However, Germany dropped the allegations due to lack of evidence. Finke was sentenced to jail by the German court in 1989 because of violation of Germany's export control laws. Biography =Nuclear Profileration= During the 1970s, Peter Finke was working as a director at Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt where he carried out research in the field of particle physics and was also serving as director of the atomic clockSee Document 2964 project. According to the Congressional investigation report of 1989, Finke smuggled sensitive nuclear detectors and nuclear technology to Pakistan in the late 1980s without notifying the German Government.http://cns.miis.edu/reports/pdfs/9707paki.pdf The report also says that he also smuggled beryllium nuclear reflectors and sensitive research publications to Pakistan in 1972.https://fas.org/spp/starwars/congress/1989/890516-cr.htm =Project-706= Finke, who was contacted by nuclear physicist turned- diplomat Dr. Siddique Ahmad Butt, better known as S. A. Butt, also passed on sensitive research publications to Dr. Butt. Finke first visited Pakistan when a German nuclear firm signed a civilian nuclear technology agreement with PAEC. However, later, Finke moved to Pakistan in 1975 to train Pakistani scientists in the field of nuclear reactor technology under the mutual agreement. When the German nuclear fuel supplier firm terminated the contract due to Finke's involvement in Project-706; Finke decided to live in Pakistan where he trained a number of Pakistani scientists in the field of nuclear reactor-device technology =PINSTECH career= Finke moved to Pakistan in 1980 where he joined Project-706 under the leadership of Munir Ahmad Khan and Abdul Qadeer Khan. Finke, eventually, worked at the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology (PINSTECH) as a researcher and produced a number of research publications along with his fellow Pakistani nuclear scientists. However, Finke was carefully excluded from Pakistan's nuclear weapons development program and was tasked to provide research publications. At PINSTECH, Peter Finke was involved in nuclear reactor technology where he researched and provided personal assistance to Pakistani scientists in nuclear reactor technology. According to his personal account, the Congressional report has stated that \\"There is no doubt that Munir Ahmed Khan, chief of the Pakistan Nuclear Authority, with whom Finke already had a cup of tea, has secretly developed his country into a nuclear power; the bomb puzzle is complete. He had many individual parts ‚Äì ranging from transformer sheets to uranium conversion ‚Äîsupplied by small West German firms, using a network of agents to this end. Finke was instrumental in the development of Tritium reflector technology for Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Finke produced research publications on Beryllium, Tritium and Thorium reflectors which were passed on to the Pakistani nuclear scientists to develop nuclear weapons. Because of his services, Finke was awarded Sitara-i-Imtiaz by the then President of Pakistan General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. Finke continued to carry out research in Pakistan's nuclear program till 1989. Later, he was transferred to PINSTECH's Nuclear Physics Division (NPD) where he became a distinguished professor of particle physics. Later, he became a full professor of high energy physics. He obtained Pakistani citizenship in 1985. Arrest and sentence to jail In 1989, Finke was arrested through a joint operation of German Police and Interpol in Germany. Finke, who was in Germany for a personal vacation, was arrested by the German Police and jailed for violating the German export control laws. The following year, Finke was charged with nuclear proliferation where he confessed his involvement in the Pakistani nuclear program. The German court found him guilty and he served a jail term in a German Prison. Finke's personal information and details have been kept secret by the Governments of Pakistan and Germany. Both Pakistan and Germany refused to provide more details regarding the scientist. The trial went fast and most of the information regarding the case was not released by Pakistan and Germany to the international press. After serving his jail term, Finke has been monitored closely by intelligence agencies and was reported to have moved back to Pakistan with his family where he became a foreign professor of particle physics at the Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad.

In an essay written at the time of publication, Warren Ellis said:  Plot  Supergod is narrated from the point of view of Simon Reddin, a British scientist who sits in the ruins of post-apocalyptic London, waiting to die. Reddin tells his story to \\"Tommy,\\" an American counterpart taking refuge in a bunker, in order to provide an oral history of the events that led to the end of the world. In years before the onset of the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union, Great Britain launches an experimental rocket with a crew of three astronauts for the sake of observing the then- unknown effects of outer space on the human body. Weeks later, when the rocket returns to Earth, scientists find that the three astronauts have been fused together into one gigantic, three-headed being by a mass of alien fungus. This creature is named \\"Morrigan Lugus,\\" after multi-headed deities from Celtic mythology. England's possession and study of Lugus spur the other developed nations of the world to begin developing their own superhuman programs. (This is ostensibly a military arms race, but several times throughout his story, Reddin injects his own opinion‚Äî supported by a speech from Lugus‚Äî that human beings have a psychological compulsion to create and worship their own gods.) The United States creates Jerry Craven, a cyborg built from the broken body of a crashed Air Force pilot; Russia creates Perun, an advanced cyborg built from the remains of a previous model destroyed by Craven; Iran creates Malak, able to generate a force field that dissolves the atomic bonds of nearby matter; China creates Maitreya, who can shape and manipulate human flesh into complex objects. The flashpoint for global conflict comes in the early 21st century with the activation of Krishna, the Indian superhuman. Krishna is built with state-of-the-art technology, granting it godlike control over both matter and energy, and is governed by a simple artificial intelligence program with instructions to \\"save India.\\" Krishna takes this command to its logical extreme, solving India's problems of pollution and severe overpopulation by laying waste to the country, leveling its cities and killing most of its people. The chaos in India prompts Pakistan to launch its entire arsenal of nuclear missiles against Krishna, but Krishna merely turns the weapons around, obliterating Pakistan. These catastrophic events provoke other nations to mobilize their own superhumans against Krishna; meanwhile, Reddin, part of the team studying Morrigan Lugus, argues that since Krishna does not appear to value human life, Lugus‚Äî as a higher form of life, like Krishna himself‚Äî should be released from the underground chamber where it is currently held so that it may communicate with Krishna and convince him to halt his rampage. Faced with no other way of stopping Krishna, the British government agrees. All attacks on Krishna fail, as he is far too powerful for any of the other superbeings to pose a threat to him. Perun and Maitreya are easily killed, and Malak is catapulted into space, where his force field shatters the Moon, causing lunar fragments to rain destruction upon the Earth. With his enemies defeated, Krishna begins the process of rebuilding India, creating structures capable of cleaning up the devastated environment and housing its surviving population. Jerry Craven arrives on the scene, but‚Äî weary of conflict and mentally traumatized by his own death and resurrection‚Äî expresses his desire to live in peace with Krishna. However, Craven is joined moments later by Dajjal, a bizarre, incomplete superhuman covertly developed by the United States during the Iraq War. Dajjal was designed to be without sanity, allowing it to observe the flow of time and to perceive all possible futures. Dajjal implies that all futures arising from this moment in time would result in a utopia created by Craven and Krishna, and would all be \\"so boring\\" that Dajjal cannot bear to live through them. To avoid this fate, Dajjal self-destructs, resulting in a massive explosion that kills Craven and Krishna and destroys most of Asia and Europe. In the present, with his story finished, Reddin bids farewell to Tommy, strips off his clothes, and prepares to leap into the River Thames to meet his \\"god\\": Morrigan Lugus, the last surviving superbeing, whose spores have infested the entire planet.

Assistant Coach Ed Yuhas introduced the drill as a pre- season conditioning drill. The initial drill consisted of 5 players spaced evenly along the baseline, with the middle player holding the ball. On the smack of the ball players pass the ball repeatedly to the nearest player, while traveling up the court. They then run behind two players. Thus the terminology, \\"pass and go behind two\\". Upon reaching the other end of the court the drill turns into a 3 on 2 drill, with the person who shot the layup and the last passer returning to play defense. The ballhandler amongst the group of the 3 will retreat to the other end after attacking the goal. The 2 defenders attack the single defender resulting in a 2 on 1 to the other side. These remaining 3 players then execute a 3 man weave to the far baseline. This drill became very popular amongst high school and small college coaches throughout the south and midwest as Coach Yuhas introduced it on the summer camp circuit.

Zatoichi: The Fugitive is the fourth episode in the 26 part film series devoted to the character of Zatoichi. Plot Ichi (which is the main character's name, Zato being the lowest rank in the Todoza) travels by foot and enters a local sumo match to earn prize money. Ichi defeats five sighted opponents to win. He is later alone and is attacked by Kisuke, a young yakuza man he has never met. Kisuke is easily dispatched and Ichi berates him for being no match for Ichi and asks why he attacked him. Kisuke tells Ichi that he did it to get ten ryo reward for killing Ichi. Before dying Kisuke reveals to Ichi that his mother is also yakuza but dies before revealing who placed the bounty on Ichi's head. Ichi travels to the local yakuza house of the Shimonida yakuza family. Just prior to Ichi's arrival Maki, the mother of Kisuke and a grandmother figure to the yakuza is with several visiting yakuza family bosses and the young new heir to the Shimonida yakuza family, Sakichi. The bosses are meeting during a local festival. Ichi meets Maki and confessing to the death of Kisuke and asks Maki's forgiveness. He tells that he killed Kisuke in a fair fight according to the yakuza code. This comforts Maki and she recognizes Ichi as honorable. Ichi gives her ten ryo which he claims Kisuke asked him to give to her. Meanwhile, Ichi stays at an inn in the town and comes across a woman he carried passionate feelings for, and possibly still does, by the name of Otane (whom Ichi affectionately calls Tane). Tane is not married to a carpenter, as she planned when last seen in a film, but to a quick-tempered ronin named Tanakura. She tells Ichi that she and her husband have done many bad things. The inn keeper's adopted daughter Nobu is in love with Sakichi but her father Shimazo does not approve of him. One of the visiting yakuza, Boss Yagiri sees the Sakichi as a weak boss and wishes to move in on the territory and demands that Ichi be killed or the Sakichi will lose his position. Yagiri plots with innkeeper Shimazo to have Sakichi and Ichi killed. It is later revealed that Shimazo is motivated to eliminate Sakichi because when his father was boss he took away a yakuza gambling house that Shimazo ran. In front of the yakuza leaders during their celebration which Ichi interrupts Tanakura, displaying his prowess but also as an act of showing Tane belonging to him, cuts Ichi's tea cup in half. In response, Ichi cuts a sake bottle in half while it is still being held. Tanakura admits defeat and establishes himself as Ichi's \\"rival\\" in this filmThe Tales of the Blind Swordsman because of his act. Sakichi tells Ichi that the yakuza have taken Tane hostage. He rushes to the old abandoned inn where Nobu grew up as a child and sees that Tane is safe and well. The yakuza surround the inn and attack. One of the men uses a rifle to fire 3 shots (which all miss) with the inheritor, Nobu, and Ichi still inside. Tane goes outside and pleads with her husband not to attack, that she loves him and that she wants him to stay alive which will not happen if he faces Ichi. However, Tanakura is determined to claim the now 300 ryo bounty on Ichi's head and to dispatch the rival to his wife's affection. Tane mistakenly partly draws his sword and he kills her instantly. Nobu sees this and tells Ichi. The news sends Ichi into a rage, he bursts outside, slaughters most of the several dozen yakuza then faces Tanakura in what is one of the most critically revered duels in the Zatoichi series.Zatoichi: The Fugitive ReviewZatoichi kyojo tabi, Movie Review During the battle Ichi's sword is broken but he stabs Tanakura with a dagger hidden in the sword's handle. As he dies Tanakura says that Ichi did not know Tane but only had a romanticized image of her, that the ambush was actually her idea to get the reward. The film concludes with Maki wishing that Ichi was her son, Ichi calling her mother and Ichi placing Nobu's hand in the hand of Sakichi before he again wanders away alone.

Early life  Marolt was raised in the Carinthian town of St. Kanzian, where her father, Heinz Anton Marolt, a former member of the Austrian Freedom Party and retired local politician, owns a hotel. She has three siblings (two brothers and one older sister). Marolt attended a Gymnasium and passed her A-Levels in 2010.

Unlike most cantrefs, it was not part of any of the major Welsh kingdoms for most of its history, but was instead ruled by an autonomous local dynasty. During the Norman era it was associated with Rhwng Gwy a Hafren, a region independent of the Welsh monarchies and controlled by Norman Marcher Lords. In the 16th century, it was reorganized as a hundred and joined with the former kingdom of Brycheiniog to form the county of Brecknockshire. Description The name Buellt, also rendered Buallt, comes from the Welsh words bu, meaning \\"ox\\", and gellt (later gwellt), meaning pasture. This was later anglicized to Builth, as in the modern town of Builth Wells. Situated in the valley of Afon Irfon, Buellt's boundaries were roughly the Cambrian Mountains to the north, the River Wye to the east, the Mynydd Epynt range to the south, and Ceredigion to the west. It was closely associated with the territories of Gwrtheyrnion, Elfael, and Maelienydd, and as such was often considered part of the region known as Rhwng Gwy a Hafren () despite being west of the Wye.Lloyd, p. 253‚Äì254. The cantref was divided into four major commotes, whose boundaries are unclear: Treflys, Pebuellt, Dinan, and Is Irfon. Most of Buellt's major sites were located along the Irfon, including the courts of the commotes and the major church at Llanafan Fawr, dedicated to Saint Afan Buellt, the cantref's chief saint.Lloyd, p. 253. Early history The 9th- or 10th-century Llanynis pillar cross from Neuadd Siarman near Builth.Allen, J.R. Celtic Art in Pagan and Christian Times. Mathuen (London), 1912. Accessed 13 Feb 2013. It is unknown when Buellt began to emerge as a distinct political unit. Its organization as a cantref seems to have developed along the earlier tribal boundaries of a gwlad (\\"people\\") or tud (\\"tribe\\").Lloyd, p. 302. During the Early Middle Ages, Buellt and Gwrtheyrnion on the other side of the Wye formed a small regional kingdom. This kingdom's rulers traced their descent back to the legendary 5th-century warlord Vortigern (, from which Gwrtheyrnion was named.) The kingdom is known from the 9th-century Historia Brittonum, whose author, possibly a native of southeastern Wales, focused particular attention on it.Lloyd, p. 224 and note.Thornton, p. 114 and note.Dumville, p. 21. The Historia recounts that after Vortigern had invited the Anglo-Saxons to Britain and then been forced west, his son Pascent ruled Buellt and Gwrtheyrnion as a grant from Ambrosius Aurelianus.Historia Brittonum, ch. 47‚Äì49. Whatever the reality of this story, another section attributes descent from Pascent and Vortigern to Ffernfael ap Tewdwr, a 9th-century ruler of Buellt and Gwrtheyrnion known from other sources.Lloyd, p. 224 and note; 253. The Historia further includes Buellt in its mirabilia section, or list of marvels. According to the text, Buellt is the location of the \\"Carn Cabal\\", a (since lost) petrosomatoglyph: the imprint of a dog's paw. This marvel is attributed to King Arthur's dog Cavall, who supposedly left the print while chasing the boar Troyt. Afterward, Arthur placed this stone on top of a cairn, and anyone who tried to move it would find it back in its place the next day.Historia Brittonum, ch. 73. The placename survives as Carn Gafallt near Rhayader, though it is unlikely the modern hill is the same one mentioned in the Historia.Bromwich, p. lxvi and noteLacy, p. 289. The prose tale Culhwch and Olwen contains a more elaborate version of Arthur's hunting of the divine boar, here known as Twrch Trwyth, however, in Culhwch the boar's detailed itinerary does not take him through Buellt. By the 11th century, Buellt and the rest of the Rhwng Gwy a Hafren passed under the control of a different dynasty tracing its descent to Elystan Glodrydd.Lloyd, p. 406 & note. Norman era Braose motte and bailey and the subsequent Edwardian stone Builth Castle on the east end of modern Builth Wells During the High Middle Ages, several rulers from the surrounding kingdoms took control of Buellt, but it generally reverted to independence upon their death. During the Norman invasion of Wales, the Marcher Lord Philip de Braose conquered Buellt shortly after he took Rhwng Gwy a Hafren in 1095.Lloyd, pp. 402‚Äì405. Philip fortified the hill east of present-day Builth Wells with a wooden motte and bailey castle and held the area until his death in 1134, when it passed to his son William.Lloyd, p. 436, 547 Through this period, however, the representatives of the old Welsh dynasty descended from Elystan contested the Marcher Lords' rule. The area changed hands between multiple Norman and Welsh figures, including Roger Mortimer, Rhys ap Gruffudd and Llywelyn the Great.Lloyd, p. 581, 644‚Äì645, 717‚Äì719. Buellt passed to Llywelyn's grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, whose rights to it (though not other parts of Rhwng Gwy a Hafren) were confirmed by King Henry III in the 1267 Treaty of Montgomery.Lloyd. pp. 739‚Äì740. In November 1282, Edward I overran Buellt as part of his final conquest of Wales.Lloyd 761‚Äì762. St Mary's in Builth Wells, retaining its 14th-century tower Edward ordered the construction of the stone Builth Castle on the site of Braose's burnt fort, although construction was halted for lack of funds. The castle saw action during Madog ap Llywelyn and Owain Glynd≈µr's rebellions, but was subsequently abandoned.Prestwich, p. 220.Pettifer, p. 10. In the 17th century it was damaged by a fire and its stones were plundered; it has since almost entirely disappeared.Gatehouse Gazetteer. \\"Builth Wells Castle\\". 10 Dec 2012. Accessed 13 Feb 2013. In the 16th century, as part of Henry VIII's Laws in Wales Acts, Buellt became a hundred and merged with Brycheiniog into the new county of Brecknockshire. In 1996 the area became part of the modern county of Powys. The cantref's name survives in the modern town of Builth Wells and the site of nearby Builth Castle.Lloyd, p. 401.

G√ºnter Felke (Laufersweiler, 4 November 1929 - Sohren, 22 March 2005) was a German furniture manufacturer, numismatist and patron of culture. Life G√ºnter Felke was born as the youngest son of the industrialist Michael Felke and his wife Maria in Laufersweiler (State of Rhineland- Palatinate). In 1929 his family moved to Sohren, a village nearby, where his father expanded his furniture factory, the company Felke M√∂belwerke. He studied at the Herzog-Johann-Gymnasium in Simmern, which he left in 1948 prior to the final exams to work for his father‚Äôs company. With his two brothers Aloys and Walter Felke he worked as a junior boss alongside his father. In 1970 he became chief operating officer and technical director.Profile aus dem Rhein-Hunsr√ºck-Kreis, Band 1, Rollf-Heiko Buyny, Boppart 1994, In 1960 G√ºnter Felke discovered his fascination with the history of numismatics in Palatinate (Pfalz) and Mainz. As a collector of Roman, medieval and modern gold coins from the Rhineland, he presented a large collection of rare exhibits to museums in Veldenz, Simmern and Heidelberg. He also wrote several essays on coining in Veldenz. In 1980 Felke became a member of the Bavarian Numismatic Society (Bayerische Numismatische Gesellschaft). One year later he published his first book about the history of native gold stamping Die M√ºnzen der Herz√∂ge von Simmern. That book was soon followed by the illustrated book Die Goldpr√§gungen der Rheinischen Kurf√ºrsten 1346-1478 in 1989. 1984 he was one of the founders of the Pf√§lzische Numismatische Gesellschaft. In the following years G√ºnter Felke subsequently increased his efforts in the cultural sector and the education for young students. His foundation has been presenting the G√ºnter-Felke-Award to outstanding students at the Herzog-Johann-Gymnasium in Simmern since 1990. G√ºnter Felke was married and the father of three children. G√ºnter-Felke-Foundation The G√ºnter Felke Foundation (G√ºnter-Felke- Stiftung) was founded by G√ºnter Felke in October 1989. The foundation has been awarding annual prizes at the Herzog-Johann-Gymnasium since 1990 to students with outstanding achievements. Since 1990 the G√ºnter-Felke-Foundation has awarded 305 prizes and a total sum of approximately 100.000 Euros to 1317 students (as of 2009).

Popular from the 1920s to the mid-1950s, the product, which developed from the sailing industry in England and Scotland, became commonly used for waterproofing. It has been replaced by more modern materials but is still used by the country sports community. The main drawbacks are two: waxed fabric is not very breathable and tends to be heavier and bulkier than modern synthetic waterproof materials. Background Early mariners noticed that wet sails were more efficient than dry sails, but their added weight slowed the vessels. From the 15th century, mariners applied fish oils and grease to their heavy sailcloth. This resulted in more efficient sails in dry weather and lighter sails in wet weather. Out of the worn remnants they cut waterproof capes to keep themselves dry; these capes were the forerunner of the fisherman's slicker. From 1795, Arbroath-based sail maker Francis Webster Ltd had perfected the art of adding linseed oil to flax sails, creating an oiled flax. Lighter than wet sailcloth, the treatment was used by the Royal Navy and the early tea clippers. As the tea race competition increased, the clipper designers and captains looked for more weight reduction. The clippers were often used to ship cotton from Egypt, so they tried this lighter material. Development The first Egyptian cotton products with linseed oil applied started to appear from the mid-1850s. Tea clipper sails were made from strong two-ply yarns in both warp and weft, which provided lighter cloth with extra strength for the larger sails. The recipe for coating each cloth remained unique to that cloth, but all cloths suffered the same problems: stiffness in the cold; and a tendency to turn a shade of yellow towards that of pure linseed oil (this contributed to the yellow colour of early fisherman's clothing). In the mid-1920s, three companies co-operated to create paraffin- impregnated cotton, which produced a highly water resistant cloth, breathable, but without the stiffness in the cold or yellowing with age. Woven by Webster's, it was taken to Lancashire for dyeing (black or olive green), and then to London for cupro-ammonia treatment. The cloth was then returned to Lancashire for waxing, and then back to Webster's for storage, sales and distribution. Webster's were cautious about disrupting their home market, and so sent the new product to another part of the British Empire with similar climatic conditions and a love of sailing for testing: New Zealand. Given the local name Japara, as the material proved a weather and sales success, it was adopted as the trademark by Webster's. In 2005 a new technology, refined hydrocarbon wax, was developed to replace cupro-ammonia treatment and remove the smell. Current United Kingdom manufacturers include British Millerain Co. Ltd., Halley Stevensons Limited, and Templemoyle Mills. British Millerain were the first to wax cotton in the UK and export this specialist textile across the globe. Halley Stevensons began as a manufacturer of textiles for upholstery, curtains and furnishing, and added waxed cotton to their range in the 1990s. More recently, Templemoyle Mills was established and began manufacturing waxed cotton in Ireland; the company registered in 2013. Use A men's waxed cotton Barbour jacket in green. Waxed cotton became an instant success with the commercial shipping industry, and Webster's as the primary manufacturer looked for alternative markets. One early adopter was J. Barbour & Sons in the outdoor industry, producing waxed jackets for farmers and gamekeepers. As motorcycling emerged as personal transport, the new company Belstaff also developed clothing. Waxed cotton came in either black, or an inconsistent dark olive. Colour was controlled by the amount of copper left from the cupro-ammonia treatment, and because of variability of the olive a complementary dark brown corduroy collar was placed on dark olive jackets. Barbour's entered the motorcycling market from the early 1930s, with the Barbour International motorcycle suit, developing their market presence through sponsorship of the British competitions and teams in motorcycle trials. Barbour International suits were worn by virtually every British International team from 1936 to 1977, and in the 1964 International Six Days Trial, actor Steve McQueen and the rest of the American team. Adopted as the first choice waterproof clothing for the British armed forces during World War II, uses of waxed cotton escalated in the late 1940s and 1950s as spare material and army-surplus was liquidated. Rubber was normal waterproofing during the nineteenth century and although not breathable was highly versatile and widely used. In 1823 Charles Macintosh patented a double textured fabric sandwiched around a layer of rubber. The Mackintosh became the synonym for the rain coat. Improved Macintosh was extremely versatile and was developed for fashionable wear and sporting activity and was made by numerous Manchester manufacturers. Other waterproof and wind proof fabrics, such as Burberry, Grenfell and Ventile were developed from the late nineteenth century. By the early 1960s wartime-developed materials including nylon and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) had come to the commercial market in volume. The development of synthetic polymers began in the 1920s, gathering pace during and after the Second World War, though it took time for light, breathable waterproofing to be developed. Although the popularity of waxed cotton has decreased considerably, there remain various forms of waxed cotton with differences in look, touch and performance. Modern uses of waxed cotton have consolidated to a niche where its warmth provides a benefit over its cost, weight and maintenance disadvantages. Maintenance The pocket of a green Barbour jacket showing wear. Wax and cotton are natural products that degrade and lose effectiveness over time. To help preserve them, waxed cotton products should not be stored damp, but slowly dried instead. Waxed cotton typically needs annual re-waxing. Because methods of waxing differ between manufacturers, rewaxing products from the original manufacturer are recommended. Rewaxing is best undertaken in the summer, when the material is naturally at a warmer temperature. Then, in small sections, wax is warmed, placed on the material, and rubbed into it with a soft cloth. Once fully applied, the material should be gently warmed to allow the wax to penetrate and evenly cover it.

History and activities In 2003, the group was handling a number of significant First Amendment lawsuits stemming from anti- globalization protests, protests at the first inauguration of George W. Bush, and protests against the Iraq War. The group argued in court that the D.C. police department, the FBI, and other government agencies unlawfully suppressed dissent and engaged in \\"preemptive mass arrests, spying and brutality.\\" The PCJF attracted attention for uncovering new facts about D.C. police and FBI conduct, including efforts to infiltrate and disrupt nonviolent activist groups. In 2001, the Partnership brought suit against the D.C. police department for its practices against protesters during Bush's inauguration. The lawsuit \\"uncovered evidence that the department had suspended rules limiting the use of force during the protests, had pressed undercover officers to infiltrate protest groups and had sought to provoke protesters and uninvolved bystanders by attacking them with batons and pepper spray.\\" In 2006, the case was settled after the D.C. police agreed to pay $685,000 and undertake reforms, including changes to its departmental handbook that instruct officers to \\"report the use of force during a mass demonstration\\" and bar officers from making arrests without evidence of a crime. The settlement also provided for additional training for officers assigned to \\"civil disturbance units.\\"Carol D. Leonnig, Police Agree to Protester Reforms, Washington Post (November 22, 2006).

In 2010, after an eight-year-long litigation battle, PCJF secured a $8.25 million settlement of a class action arising from the mass arrests of nearly 400 people in Pershing Park in Washington, D.C., in September 2002.

Through a Freedom of Information Act request, the PCJF obtained in 2012 a set of FBI documents showing that the FBI counterterrorism agents had monitored the Occupy movement. Verheyden-Hilliard, the executive director, said that the documents showed that the FBI has acted improperly by collecting \\"information on people's free-speech actions\\" and entering it into \\"unregulated databases, a vast storehouse of information widely disseminated to a range of law- enforcement and, apparently, private entities\\" (see Domestic Security Alliance Council).Michael S.

Between 1177 and 1179, as a result of the revolt against his father, Mieszko, with his parents and siblings, were exiled from Poland. They probably returned to the country in 1181, when Mieszko III regained the rule over Greater Poland. In 1184 and thanks to the wise diplomatic affairs of his father, Mieszko the Younger was appointed by the sickly Duke Leszek Governor of the Masovian-Kuyavian principality, and with this, apparently the right of succession after his death. However, the arbitrary and cruel government of Mieszko III, caused that Leszek reassumed his alliance with Casimir II the Just, who was appointed his sole heir. In 1185 Mieszko was then deposed and returned to his father's court.

Unfortunately, Casimir II soon regained the control of the district, and the Prince-Governor was exiled. At this point, Mieszko III decided to give the district of Kalisz to his youngest son and namesake, as his own Duchy. Mieszko the Younger died on 2 August 1193.

He was elected to the United Kingdom House of Commons at the age of 21, qualified as a barrister whilst still a member of parliament (MP), and later became a judge in the Irish Free State.  Early life  Kenny was born at Freaghcastle, near Milltown Malbay in County Clare, to the solicitor Michael Kenny and his wife Bridget, n√©e Frost.Clare Journal, 4 February 1861.

In 1899 he went bankrupt and his estates were sold off.notice of Auction 1899 as directed by the bankruptcy court, OAC Archive He became a King's Counsel in 1914.  Political career  Kenny was just 21 years of age when he was selected as the Home Rule League candidate for a by-election for Ennis in November 1882. Ennis's Home Rule MP Lysaght Finigan had resigned his seat on 15 September 1882, owing to ill-health. According to Kieran Sheedy's The Clare Elections (p. 269), According to Hugh Weir's Houses of Clare (1999, p. 131), Kenny was the youngest Member of Parliament at the time. The Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 abolished Ennis's separate parliamentary representation, with effect from the 1885 general election. The former two- seat Clare county constituency was divided for parliamentary purposes was split into the new single-member constituencies of East Clare and West Clare with one member to be elected in each division. Kenny did contest either of the new Clare seats, standing instead in Mid Tyrone, where he was elected. However he continued to interest himself in political developments in Clare. Kenny held the Mid-Tyrone seat from 1885‚Äì95. When the Irish Parliamentary Party split in 1890, he opposed Parnell.Ferguson, King's Inns Barristers 1868‚Äì2004, p.72. Indeed, he suffered a black eye at the hands of a Parnellite member Pierce Mahony.New York Times, 25 January 1893. Kenny retired from political life in 1895 and apart from his activities as a breeder of pedigree horses, cattle and sheep devoted himself to the practice of law. In 1887, he married Elizabeth Robertson Stewart, daughter of W. R. Stewart, of Lairsill or Lairdshill, Aberdeenshire. They had two sons and two daughters. He was appointed Senior Crown Prosecutor for County Kerry in 1916, and was appointed circuit court judge for Cork City and County in 1925,Irish Times, 26 August 1925. retiring in 1933 . Maurice Healy notes that his term of office had been extended due to the universal respect in which he was held. The Irish Times of 6 October 1941 published Matthew Kenny's memories of Charles Stewart Parnell to mark the 50th anniversary of the latter's death. Matthew Kenny, initially a Parnellite M.P., was a cousin of William Kenny, a Liberal Unionist M.P. The two cousins' tenures on opposite sides in the House of Commons overlapped between 1892 and 1895. Both were descended from Mathias Kenny of Treanmanagh, Kilmurry Ibricken and Dysert, Dysert, Co.

History  = Early history = A 1923 Willys‚ÄìOverland Model 64 at the Vintage Car Museum & Event Center in Weatherford, Texas Motor Assembly in Building 90, Willys Overland Plant, Toledo, Ohio, 1920 In 1908, John Willys bought the Overland Automotive Division of Standard Wheel Company and in 1912 renamed it Willys‚ÄìOverland Motor Company. From 1912 to 1918, Willys was the second-largest producer of automobiles in the United States after Ford Motor Company. In 1913, Willys acquired a license to build Charles Knight's sleeve-valve engine which it used in cars bearing the Willys‚ÄìKnight nameplate. In the mid-1920s, Willys also acquired the F.B. Stearns Company of Cleveland and assumed continued production of the Stearns-Knight luxury car, as well. John Willys acquired the Electric Auto-Lite Company in 1914 and in 1917 formed the Willys Corporation to act as his holding company. In 1916, it acquired the Russell Motor Car Company of Toronto, Ontario and the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company in Buffalo, New York, by 1917, New Process Gear, and in 1919 acquired the Duesenberg Motors Company plant in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The New Jersey plant was replaced by a new, larger facility in Indianapolis, and was to be the site of production for a new Willys Six at an adjacent site, but the depression of 1920‚Äì21 brought the Willys Corporation to its knees. The bankers hired Walter P. Chrysler to sort out the mess and the first model to go was the Willys Six, deemed an engineering disaster. Chrysler had three auto engineers: Owen Skelton, Carl Breer, and Fred Zeder (later nicknamed The Three Musketeers) begin work on a new car, commonly referred to as the Chrysler Six. To raise cash needed to pay off debts, many of the Willys Corporation assets were put on the auction block. The Elizabeth plant and the Chrysler Six prototype were sold to William C. Durant, then in the process of building a new, third empire. The plant built Durant's low-priced Star, while the Chrysler Six prototype was substantially reworked to become the 1923 Flint. Walter Chrysler and the three engineers who had been working on the Chrysler Six all moved on to Maxwell-Chalmers where they continued their work, ultimately launching the six-cylinder Chrysler in January 1924. (In 1925, the Maxwell car company became the Chrysler Corporation.) =Depression era= A Willys‚ÄìOverland Whippet badge 1928 Willys‚ÄìOverland dealer in Arkansas, circa 1930‚Äì1945 In 1926, Willys‚ÄìOverland introduced a new line of small cars named Willys‚ÄìOverland Whippet. In the economic depression of the 1930s, a number of Willys automotive brands faltered. Stearns-Knight was liquidated in 1929. Whippet production ended in 1931; its models were replaced by the Willys Six and Eight. Production of the Willys-Knight ended in 1933. There was also a pickup truck version of the Whippet, called the Willys-Six C-113 (reflecting its wheelbase in inches). This was not a sales success, with a mere 198 units being built. This vehicle was picked up by International Harvester, who installed their own 213-cubic inch engine and offered it in 1933 as the International D-1. In 1932, Ward M. Canaday, who beginning in 1916 had done advertising for the company before becoming a full-time employee, had taken on the role of chairman. He helped guide the company through its current receivership. At this time, Willys decided to clear the boards and produce two new models ‚Äì the 4-cylinder Willys 77 and the 6-cylinder Willys 99 ‚Äì but since the firm was once again on the verge of bankruptcy, only the 77 went into production. It was forced to sell its Canadian subsidiary, itself in weak financial shape, and started a massive reorganization. Only the main assembly plant and some smaller factories remained the property of Willys‚ÄìOverland. The other assets were sold off to a new holding company that leased some of the properties back to W-O. The parent company was thus able to ride out the storm. In 1936, the Willys‚ÄìOverland Motor Company was reorganized as Willys‚ÄìOverland Motors. In 1937, Willys redesigned the 4-cylinder model. It gained a semistreamlined body with a slanted windshield, headlamps integrally embedded into the fenders, and a one-piece, rounded hood transversely hinged at the rear. For 1939, the Model 39 featured Lockheed hydraulic brakes, a two- inch increase in wheelbase to 102 inches and an improved 134 DID four-cylinder engineOdin, L.C.

In 1929, the company built a factory that built vehicles located at what is now 6201 Randolph Street, Commerce, California. During World War II, the factory built aircraft assemblies for Lockheed Hudson bombers. When the war ended, the factory resumed automobile production and was one of two locations to build the first CJ2A, as well as the Willys Aero. The factory was closed in 1954. The location is now occupied by Prologis Eaves Distribution Center.1948 diagram showing Willys‚ÄìOverland factory location =World War II= = Jeep = Willys‚ÄìOverland was one of several bidders when the War Department sought an automaker that could begin rapid production of a lightweight truck based on a design by American Bantam. In 1938, Joseph W. Frazer had joined Willys from Chrysler as chief executive. He saw a need to improve the firm's 4-cylinder engine to handle the abuse to which the Jeep would be subjected. This objective was brilliantly achieved by ex-Studebaker chief engineer Delmar \\"Barney\\" Roos, who wanted Production of the Willys MB, better known as Jeep, began in 1941, shared between Willys, Ford, and American Bantam. 8,598 units were produced that year and 359,851 units before the end of World War II. Willys‚ÄìOverland ranked 48th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.Peck, Merton J. & Scherer, Frederic M. The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis (1962) Harvard Business School p.619 In total, 653,568 military Jeeps were manufactured. The origin of the name \\"Jeep\\" has been debated for many years. Some people believe \\"Jeep\\" is a phonetic pronunciation of the abbreviation GP, from \\"General Purpose\\", that was used as part of the official Army nomenclature. The first documented use of the word \\"Jeep\\" was the name of a character Eugene the Jeep in the Popeye comic strip, known for his supernatural abilities (e.g. walking through walls). It was also the name of a small tractor supplied to the U.S. Army by Minneapolis-Moline in 1937. Whatever the source, the name stuck and on February 13, 1943, Willys‚ÄìOverland filed a trademark application on the use of the term \\"Jeep\\" with the U.S Patent Office. After several denials by the patent office and appeals by Willys‚ÄìOverland, the trademark \\"Jeep\\" was finally awarded to the company on June 13, 1950. Willys also built 1292 airframes for the JB-2 Loon.Scholarworks (PDF) =Postwar struggles= After the war, Willys did not resume production of its passenger-car models, choosing instead to concentrate on Jeeps and Jeep-based vehicles. The first postwar Willys product was the CJ-2A, an MB stripped of obviously military features, particularly the blackout lighting, and with the addition of a tailgate. Willys initially struggled to find a market for the vehicle, first attempting to sell it primarily as an alternative to the farm tractor. Tractors were in short supply, having been out of production during the war. However, sales of the \\"Agri-Jeep\\" never took off, mainly because it was too light to provide adequate draft. The CJ-2A was among the first civilian vehicles of any kind to be equipped with four-wheel drive from the factory, and it gained popularity among farmers, ranchers, hunters, and others who needed a lightweight vehicle for use on unimproved roads and trails. 1947 Willys Jeep station wagon In 1946, a year after the introduction of the CJ-2A, Willys produced the Willys \\"Jeep\\" Utility Wagon based on the same engine and transmission, with clear styling influence from the CJ-2A Jeep. The next year came a \\"Jeep\\" Utility Truck with four-wheel drive. In 1948, the wagon was available in four-wheel drive, making it the ancestor of all sport utility vehicles. Willys planned to re-enter the passenger car market in 1947 with the Willys 6‚Äì70 sedan. Its name came from the fact it was powered by a 6-cylinder engine that produced 70 hp. The 6‚Äì70 was touted as the 'first stock car' in America that offered independent suspension on all four wheels, but it never entered production. In 1948, under a contract from the U.S. Army, Willys produced a small one-man four-wheeled utility vehicle called the Jungle Burden Carrier which evolved into the M274 Utility ¬Ω-ton vehicle. Willys later produced the M38 Jeep for the U.S. Army, and continued the CJ series of civilian Jeeps. One variation was the Jeepster, which came with a 4-cylinder or 6-cylinder engine, but only with two-wheel drive to the rear. =1950s= In 1952, Willys re-entered the car market with a new compact car, the Willys Aero. At first available only as a two-door sedan, it was available with either an L-head or F-head six- cylinder engine. Export markets could get the Aero with a four-cylinder engine. A four-door sedan and a two-door hardtop were added for 1953 along with taxi models. The Aero cars were called Lark, Wing, Falcon, Ace, or Eagle depending on year, engine, and trim level, except for a small production run in its final year (1955) with models called Custom and Bermuda. The bodies for the Willys Aero were supplied by the Murray Body Corporation, which also made the bodies for the short-lived Hudson Jet. Also in 1952, CJ-3B Jeeps went into production. By 1968, over 155,000 were sold. In 1953, Kaiser Motors purchased Willys‚ÄìOverland and changed the company's name to Willys Motor Company. The same year, production of the Kaiser car was moved from Willow Run, Michigan, to the Willys plant at Toledo, Ohio. Although Jeep production was steady, sales of the Willys and Kaiser cars continued to fall.Herman, pp. 342‚Äì344 =The Brazilian era= Willys‚ÄìOverland established its Brazilian operations in 1953, just before the Kaiser-Frazer takeover. The tooling for the Aero went to Brazil, where it entered production in 1960. In 1956‚Äì1957, Brazil's Executive Group for the Automotive Industry (GEIA) had approved Willys‚ÄìOverland for production of the Aero, the Willys MB Jeep, a truck version of the Jeep called the Rural, and the French Renault Dauphine small car.Shapiro, p. 897 Also, an abortive plan was made to create a company called Chrysler-Willys do Brasil SA to build the 1956 Plymouth Savoy and a Dodge truck there, in the hope of taking advantage of Willys' \\"Brazilian-made\\" credentials. Willys went through considerable effort to appear as a Brazilian company, even selling a large portion of their company to Brazilian stockholders to forestall a possible nationalist backlash, and to become eligible for various government incentives.Wolfe, p. 128 The little tail- engined Dauphine was a result of Kaiser's Renault connection, and was produced by Willys do Brasil from 1959 until 1968. Willys‚ÄìOverland was one of the first companies to enter the Brazilian passenger automobile market, and their early entry originally paid off, with sales spiking in 1954 when Willys became the number-one selling car.Wolfe, p. 120 Being distributed by the family of Get√∫lio Vargas' closest advisor Osvaldo Aranha also helped, and Willys‚ÄìOverland reached a 52% share of Brazilian passenger car production in 1959.Wolfe, p. 121 Willys held a market share of around 30% in Brazil from 1960 until 1966, its last full year as an independent, mostly Brazilian-owned company.Shapiro, p. 936 Willys entered the Brazilian market in the hope of offsetting their shrinking market and losses at home. However, unlike in the case of the Argentinian Kaiser operations, which were essentially developed around hand-me-downs, Willys built a very modern plant from the ground up in Brazil. The original promise was to build cars for export back to the United States, but such a situation never materialized.Wolfe, p. 119 However, by late 1961, Brazilian-built Willys Jeeps began to be exported to Chile.Wolfe, p. 123 Willys expanded into Brazil's impoverished northeast in the early 1960s, when they built an assembly plant for the Jeep in the state of Pernambuco.Wolfe, p. 124 In 1962, Willys started building the French Alpine A108 as the Willys Interlagos. It was produced until 1966 and was the first Brazilian-made sports car. It was also the car in which many Brazilian racers cut their teeth, including greats such as Emerson Fittipaldi. Willys also designed and showed a larger sports car called the \\"Capeta\\" (Devil) in 1964, powered by the 2.6-litre six-cylinder Aero engine. In 1965, Willys‚ÄìOverland do Brasil and Renault began collaborating on a new front-wheel drive car, called \\"Project M\\" and meant to replace the aging Dauphine. Developed in parallel with the Renault 12, which it antedated, the car eventually saw light as the Ford Corcel. Early Corcels had \\"Willys\\" stamping in the glass, and the Corcel line (which continued in production until 1997 as the Ford Pampa) always showed its French origins in its characteristic three-bolt wheels. In 1967, Ford took a controlling interest in Kaiser and thereby gained control of Willys‚ÄìOverland do Brasil.Shapiro, p. 935 The Aero-based Itamaraty continued in production until the early 1970s, in latter years wearing \\"Ford\\" badges. Dauphine production ended in 1968, but the Willys Rural/Pickup and its derivatives were built as the Ford F-75 until 1983. The only visual difference is that the post-1970 cars have a tailgate with \\"Ford\\" rather than \\"Jeep\\" stamped in it. The military version of the Jeep Pickup was called the F-85. In America, the company had already changed its name in 1963 to Kaiser-Jeep Corporation; the Willys name disappeared thereafter. Legacy Kaiser-Jeep was sold to American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1970 when Kaiser Industries decided to leave the automobile business. After the sale, AMC used engines it had developed for its other cars in Jeep models to improve performance and standardize production and servicing. Renault purchased a major stake in AMC in 1979 and took over operation of the company, producing the CJ series until 1986. Chrysler purchased AMC in 1987 after the CJ had already been replaced with the Jeep Wrangler (also known as the YJ and later TJ), which had little in common with the CJ series other than outward appearance. The Jeep marque, owned by DaimlerChrysler and later Fiat, produces Jeep vehicles at a new Toledo Complex. DaimlerChrysler introduced the Overland name for a trim package on the 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The badging is a recreation of the Overland nameplate from the early twentieth century. In 2014, the Willys trademark was acquired by Italian Carrozzeria Viotti, declaration of Emanuele Bomboi (head of design of Viotti).Willys AW Berlinetta Carrozzeria Viotti together Fabbrica Italiana Maggiora introduce at the Bologna Motor Show 2014 the Willys AW 380 Berlineta, a concept car inspired by the original Willys Interlagos assembled by Willys in Brazil under license of the French Alpine. Viotti and Maggiora plans to produce the vehicle in limited edition and relaunch the Willys marque.

It was launched on July 6, 2011 on Facebook with the original name Civilization Network; the game title was officially changed to Civilization World on January 6, 2012. On February 28, 2013, it was announced that the game would be discontinued and was shut down on May 29, 2013. Gameplay Civilization World contained many gameplay elements featured in previous Civilization installments such as building houses, farming lands, researching science, collecting gold and expanding communities over several eras. The goal of each game was to reach the end with the most fame points which could be achieved by completing achievements, discovering new technologies, completing era victory conditions or building a wonder of the world.2KGames.

Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZJ97DCNXXo Unlike previous installments in the series, the game featured real-time strategy rather than the turn-based strategy the series is known for. When in combat with another nation, the player was able to choose from ranged, melee, mobile and naval units. The battle field had limited slots for each unit which allowed the player to prioritize and strategically pick and choose unit placements.IGN. (2011, 07, 05). CivWorld: Tips & Tricks.

Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZv7N9_CmI4& Civilization World featured online compatibility and had a heavy emphasis on multiplayer which allowed player-to-player interaction. Players were allowed to play single-player or multiplayer matches allowing several players to work together and compete against others to achieve victory. Multiplayer allowed players to form independent nations and battle other competing nations, a feature not present in previous installments. Nations were structured by hierarchy, the highest being the king while other ranks include princes, dukes and other nobles. To be crowned king and become the leader of a nation, the player had to complete a series of objectives and achieve medals. Ranking was relative to all other players within the nation, meaning each player within a nation competed against each other to become king. Development According to an early (October 2009) announcement from Sid Meier, Civilization World was intended to offer \\"everything you enjoy in Civ in a fully persistent environment ‚Äî you can play as much as you like, whenever you like, and it'll be free to play.\\" From May to September 2010, the official 2K Games team offered no updates regarding Civilization World, causing many followers to believe the entire project had been scrapped (or indeed, never existed in the first place). In August, 2K Games' Community Manager \\"2K Greg\\" announced that Civilization World was, however, still very much alive. In November 2010, Take-Two's soon-to-be CEO (then the company's Executive Chairman) Strauss Zelnick confirmed once again that Civilization World was still in production, with the planned release date set for sometime in 2011. Release On July 6, 2011 Civilization World entered open beta and was made available to the public. On February 28, 2013, it was announced that the last day of play for CivWorld would be May 29, 2013. The game servers crashed about 6 minutes after the announced time.

Friedensthal, St. Croix, 9 June 1784) was a Moravian bishop. He came to the United States in 1735, and joined the Moravian colony in the province of Georgia. Thence he went to Pennsylvania, and assisted at the founding of Bethlehem. Soon afterward he was appointed missionary among the Indians, and labored with great success for twenty years in New York, Pennsylvania, and New England. Both in New York and New England the Moravians were accused of being spies of the French, and in consequence their missionaries were made to suffer. Mack was arrested and imprisoned at Milford, Connecticut, and banished from the province of New York. But such persecutions speedily came to an end when, in 1749, the parliament of Great Britain acknowledged the Moravians to be an ancient episcopal church, and invited them to settle in this country. Meanwhile Mack had founded Gnadenh√ºtten, a nourishing Christian Indian settlement in the Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania. At a later time he founded Nain, another Christian Indian town, near Bethlehem. He was in the full tide of successful work when he was unexpectedly called to the West Indies as superintendent of the missions in the Danish islands. Although it cost him a hard struggle to give up his labors among the aborigines and leave America, he accepted the call, and for twenty-two years devoted himself to the interests of the slaves in Saint Croix, Saint John, and Saint Thomas, where he resided. In 1770 he visited Bethlehem, where he was consecrated to the episcopacy on 18 Oct. On returning to the West Indies he continued his work, and in the midst of that war between England and France that grew out of the American Revolution he visited all the missions on the British islands, and twice narrowly escaped capture.

At the time of its listing, it was located on Church Street at the Oconee County Law Enforcement Center. It was named to the National Register of Historic Places on November 14, 1982 along with the Oconee County Jail. At the time of its listing, the cage was considered the most intact cage in South Carolina. Oconee County has preserved the cage as a reminder of the former harsh conditions faced by convicts in the early twentieth century. Early 20th-century county penal system In the early twentieth century, county jails in South Carolina were primarily for holding individuals who were awaiting trial that could not afford bail. Male convicted prisoners were either sentenced to hard labor on the county chain gang or sent to the state penitentiary. In 1916, about 94% were in county chain gangs and about 6% were at the state penitentiary. In this period of racial segregation, white prisoners were separated from African-American prisoners. Instead of being housed in the county jail, chain gangs were housed in cages, cars, or tents near the work site. The cages and cars could be used to also transport the convicts. History This jail on wheels was one of several used in the early twentieth century for the housing and transport of prisoners on the chain gang. It was built around 1900. In 1915, the State Board of Charities and Corrections reported that the chain gang was about from Seneca where the convicts were repairing the Oconee Station Road. There were two cages. One held eight African-American men and the other held four white men. For breakfast, they ate bacon, biscuits, syrup, and coffee. For dinner, they ate cabbage, bacon, and cornbread. For supper, they had bacon, biscuits, and syrup. In 1917, they reported that the cages were screened. In 1918, they said that the chain gang only had African Americans. White convicts were held at the jail or sent to the state penitentiary. The chain gang convicts typically had a sentence of two months or less. Their families could visit on weekends and bring food. One former convict recalled that the convicts, guards, and their families all ate together and talked. In the 1930s, the county had gasoline-powered trucks and built a new jail. The cages were no longer used. Although the chain gang faced harsh conditions during this period, it was considered to be an improvement over that faced by many convicts prior to 1900. There is a similar jail on wheels in the neighboring Pickens County. Architecture It is a metal cage on a chassis with wheels. Draft animals were hitched to a metal tongue attached to the front axle. The cage is approximately long, , and high. The front, top, and floor are solid sheet metal. The sides of the cage are metal bars with riveted strips to form a grid. The rear is sheet metal with a hinged metal door. The cage had four metal bunk beds with three beds each along the sides. The bunks had metal strips to support the bedding. There was a metal barrel in the center for a fire. Canvas was used to cover the sides in cold weather. Additional pictures of the cage are available.

Construction Built in 1914 by Beyer, Peacock and Company, Manchester, 3112 was one of 145 locomotives of the S636 class of 4-6-4T tank locomotives built specifically to handle the increasing volume of suburban traffic in Sydney, particularly on the steeply graded Northern, North Shore and Illawarra lines. The S636 class was later reclassified as the C30 class in 1924 and given new running numbers in the 30xx series. Following the electrification of the Sydney suburban network, 77 of the C30 class locomotives, were converted into C30T 4-6-0 tender locomotives between 1928 and 1933 and which were used to replace older and largely obsolete locomotives then working on the lightly-laid country branch lines throughout New South Wales. The remaining 68 engines not converted were used on outer suburban services in Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong, while others ended up assisting on local trains in suburban areas and short country trips. In Service Entering service in 1914 as S1240, 3112 was used initially on suburban duties around Sydney. It received its present number of 3112 in 1924 as part of the reclassification of the S636 locomotives into the C30 class. Following the displacement of the C30 class from Sydney suburban service by the new electric trains, 3112 was employed on local suburban services from Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong. From 1956 onwards 3112 and others were also employed in carriage-shunting duties at Sydney Central along with other members of its class. Previously, two Z26 class 2-6-2ST saddle tank locomotives had been employed on this duty, but electrification of the carriage sidings at Sydney Central in 1956 meant that it was too risky to use them since the water inlet on the engines' water tanks was on top of the saddle tank. As side tank locomotives, the C30 class had no such safety restrictions, and so they also took up these additional duties. 3112 was also out-stationed at other yards which required large shunting locomotives, and is recorded as having worked at such locations such as Bathurst. Withdrawal and Preservation 4472 Flying Scotsman and 3801 in June 1989 With the arrival of new diesel locomotives in the 1960s, 3112 and the other members of the C30 were deemed to be surplus to requirements. 3112 was withdrawn sometime in the February 1972, and sold to the Lachlan Valley Railway at Parkes in 1974.Steam Notes Railway Digest September 1974 page 12 It was then relocated to the Forbes Vintage Village, along with 1919 and 6042. It was subsequently purchased at auction in November 1986, by Barry Tulloch. Following the purchase, it was moved by road and rail to Cowra Locomotive Depot on 21 December 1986. Barry Tulloch, with the help of Ian MacDonald and many (37) likeminded enthusiasts, restored 3112 to a running condition. It left Cowra on 26 January 1988, and came to Sydney via Harden to its new home at Eveleigh Railway Workshops. Restoration continued on many ancillary items throughout 1988, as well as extra refinements to equip it to run excursion trains. With 3112's return to steam, it travelled over many parts of NSW. It attended the Aus Steam '88 event in Melbourne, travelling south in the company of 1210. 3112 was supposed to have left Goulburn, bound for Melbourne early on 14 October 1988, but failed with a hot axlebox that prevented it from departing on time. The locomotive was repaired and later that day, ran south to join 1210 at Albury on 15 October, to continue the journey to Melbourne. On another occasion, 3112 was one of three locomotives selected to run a triple- headed excursion from Maitland to Sydney with the return run from the Hunter Valley Steamfest. The loco ran with 3801 and 4472 Flying Scotsman during 1989. On the Queen's Birthday weekend of 1989, 3112 assisted 3801 and 4472 from Valley Heights to Katoomba on the 1-in-33 grades. Between 1988 and 2007, 3112 saw most of its work with 3801 Limited, attending the annual Hunter Valley Steamfest at Maitland and Thirlmere's Festival of Steam, as well as running enthusiast specials to Kiama, Gosford, Moss Vale and other locations in the Sydney area, during which it was sometimes paired with 3801 and 3830. It has also worked with 1210, 3001T, 3016T, 3137, 3526 and 5910. During this time the locomotive was based at the Eveleigh Workshops, home to 3801 Limited, where Barry, Ian and a small band of volunteers attended to running maintenance and statutory examinations. In May 2007, 3112 was sold by Barry Tulloch to Boyd Munro, who decided to move the locomotive to Canberra to be kept with the rest of his collection in July 2007. The locomotive was then placed in open storage in the sidings behind the Canberra Railway Museum. In February 2015, it moved to CFCL Australia's Goulburn Railway Workshops for an overhaul.Staff mixes modern engineering with old Track & Signal April 2015 page 77 It was steamed in August 2018.Preservation Railway Digest September 2018 page 53 3112 has also appeared on television on at least one occasion. Its most recent was when it appeared briefly in one episode of Series 5 of The Block, during which it almost ran the couples over since their 'magic doors' placed them right on the entrance to Sydney Central station. This was achieved using blue-screen technology and footage of 3112 approaching the platform.

Born in Springboro, Pennsylvania, Connick eventually settled in the Boston area where he opened his studio in 1913. Connick's work is contained in many preeminent churches and chapels, including examples in Boston, Chicago, Detroit, New York City, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. He also authored the book Adventures in Light and Color in 1937. Connick's studio continued to operate, and remained a leading producer of stained glass, until 1986. Life Exterior of Connick's rose window at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York Born in Springboro in Crawford County, Pennsylvania on September 27, 1875, Connick moved with his family to Pittsburgh when he was eight years old. Bullied by city children who made fun of his countrified attire, Connick would stay indoors during recess and draw with crayons, and thereby developed an interest in drawing and color at a young age. When obligated to leave high school when his father was disabled, he became an illustrator on the staff of the Pittsburgh Press. At the age of 19, Connick became apprenticed in the production of stained glass windows at the shop of Rudy Brothers in Pittsburgh, where he stayed through 1899. He left for work in Boston for two years, returning to Pittsburgh in 1903 and worked for a number of stained-glass companies both in Pittsburgh and New York. Connick also studied drawing and painting in night classes and went to England and France to study ancient and modern stained glass, including those in the Chartres Cathedral, in which he examined the effect of light and optics that had been employed in the 12th and 13th centuries, but which he perceived to be neglected since. Connick was also influenced by English Arts and Crafts Movement stained glass artist Christopher Whall. Connick's first major work, the First Baptist Church in Pittsburgh, was completed in 1912. Connick settled in Boston where he opened his stained glass studio at Nine Harcourt Street, Back Bay, Boston in 1913. From there until his death, Connick designed and produced many notable stained glass windows including the rose windows of the Cathedrals of St. Patrick and St. John the Divine in New York City, and windows in the Princeton University Chapel, the American Church in Paris, and in the Calvary Episcopal and East Liberty Presbyterian churches in Pittsburgh. One of his largest works is in the Heinz Memorial Chapel at the University of Pittsburgh. Heinz Chapel has the distinction of having all of its 23 windows () designed by Connick, including its 73-foot (22 m) tall transept windows which are among the tallest such windows in the world. Connick also authored the book Adventures in Light and Color, modestly subtitled An Introduction to the Stained Glass Craft, as well as a series for Random House titled International Studio (1923‚Äì24). Connick was active in, among other societies, the Boston Art Club, Boston Architectural Club, The Mural Painters, and the Copley Society of Art. Connick adopted the Pegasus as his symbol and designed it in stained glass which was carved on his gravestone. Charles Jay Connick died on December 28, 1945. At his death, The New York Times reported that Dr. Connick was \\"considered the world's greatest contemporary craftsman in stained glass.\\" (The New York Times, Saturday, December 29, 1945, p. 13.) Style Connick's 73-foot (22 m) tall transept windows of Heinz Memorial Chapel at the University of Pittsburgh are among the tallest in the world Connick preferred to use clear \\"antique\\" glass, similar to that of the Middle Ages and praised this type of glass as \\"colored radiance, with the lustre, intensity, and baffling vibrant quality of dancing lights.\\" He employed a technique of \\"staggered\\" solder-joints in his leading and bars, which English stained-glass historian Peter Cormack says gives the windows their \\"syncopated or 'swinging' character.\\" His style incorporated a strong interest in symbolism as well. Connick expressed the opinion that the first job of stained glass was to serve the architectural effect, and he believed that his greatest contribution to glasswork was \\"rescuing it from the abysmal depth of opalescent picture windows\\" of the sort popularized by Louis Comfort Tiffany and John La Farge. Although firmly committed to a regenerated handicraft tradition, Connick welcomed innovation and experimentation in design and technique among his co- workers at his studio. Studio In many respects, Connick's Boston studio was the arts and crafts ideal in that the art was produced by a community of committed craftsmen. At its height in the 1930s, forty to fifty men and women worked at the studio, which, as Connick wrote in his will, was \\"only incidentally a business.\\" A reporter visiting his studio in 1931 remarked on the atmosphere of mutual respect that was present there saying \\"Attitude to his co-designers [is] that of one artist to another...He [Connick] originates, supervises. They elaborate.\\" Connick left his studio and business to the craftsmen which became a cooperative after his death. For 41 years the studio continued to receive commissions and design windows in the Connick tradition. The studio closed its workshop in 1986 because the workers were aging and the modern high-rises of Copley Square threatened the light source essential to their work. The final commissioned window the studio produced was placed in All Saints Parish of Brookline, Massachusetts. Shortly after closing, the studio donated its collection of records, working drawings and related materials to the Boston Public Library. Throughout its history, the Charles J. Connick Associates Studio produced some 15,000 windows in more than 5,000 churches and public buildings. Foundation The Charles J. Connick Stained Glass Foundation, Ltd., was formed after the studio closed in 1986. Its mission is to \\"promote the true understanding of the glorious medium of color and light and to preserve and perpetuate the Connick tradition of stained glass.\\" In December 2008, the foundation donated materials to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Rotch Library of Architecture and Planning to form the Charles J. Connick Stained Glass Foundation Collection. This collection contains photographs, slides, stained glass windows and designs, paintings, and documents related to both the foundation and the studio. MIT is currently processing the collection.

Life Horsnell was born in Chelmsford, Essex, on 12th of August 1881. He trained as an architect in the office of Frederick Chancellor FRIBA in Chelmsford. In 1899 he designed a house for Charles Baskett, then assistant master at Chelmsford School of Art, in Maldon Road, Colchester. It is distinctive design in the manner of Voysey, with white walls, green slate roof, and a canopy over the front door on curly iron brackets, and is one of Horsnell's few surviving buildings While working in Chelmsford he won a travelling studentship from the Architectural Association. He visited France and Italy and the sketches from these visits were well regarded. Many of them were displayed at the RIBA in the summer of 1915 and published in the Building News and Engineering Journal in 1915 and 1916. He won both the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Tite Prize in 1906 (for Italianate Designs) and the Soane Medallion in 1910,The Building News and Engineering Journal 110 July 1916 the latter awarded for his design for a Shakespeare Memorial Theatre. He moved to London, where he worked at 2 South Square, Gray's Inn alongside Charles Gascoyne, George Nott, and Robert Atkinson.Robert Atkinson, Dictionary of Scottish Architects. During these pre- war years, he worked as an assistant to Ernest Newton and drew perspectives for notable houses in Cheltenham (Greenway, Shurdington) and Lingfield (Ardenrun Place).RIBA One of his last great perspectives was the pencil and watercolour of County Hall, London.

Toure helped to define a new generation of black consciousness by creating a triumphal identity for the purpose of uplifting the African heritage beyond the oppressive ideas that dominated the time. Life Born Roland Snellings, on October 13, 1938, in Raleigh, North Carolina, to Clifford R. and Nancy (Bullock) Snelling, he lived under the care of his paternal grandmother in La Grange, Georgia until he was six years old. Although he later joined his family in Dayton, Ohio, his frequent trips to Georgia and North Carolina would be credited with the foundation for his early poetic imagery. He attended public school and graduated from Dayton's Roosevelt High School in 1956. During this time he had begun spending much of his time singing \\"Doo Wop\\" at local nightclubs, inspiring a desire to pursue a career in the music industry. However, he forfeited this path when he joined the United States Air Force, serving from 1956 to 1959. With his military service in his wake, he moved to New York City in order to study visual arts at the Art Students League from 1960 to 1962. This new path allowed him to pursue a career as an illustrator for Umbra Magazine. During this time Tour√© was introduced to several prominent poets, authors, and activist affiliated with the magazine. It was with these influences that his poetry developed and matured, carrying the styles of W.E.B Dubois, William Butler Yeats, Pablo Neruda, Langston Hughes, as well as the rhythm and tones found in popular jazz music. From 1963 to 1965, he served on the editorial board of Black America,the \\"literary arm of the black nationalist Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM). He also served on the staff of Liberator Magazine and was the associate editor for Black Dialogue. From this publication he furthered his career in becoming the editor-and-chief for the Journal of Black Poetry (now Kitabu Cha Juai) where his voice worked to redefine the black identity and strengthen the abolishment of black oppression. With the assassination of Malcolm X, Tour√© joined forces with influential scholar Larry Neal to found the newspaper Afro World and take the streets of Harlem by storm by cultivating an event which led to the formation/creation of Harlem's Black Arts School.He participated in the Fulton Art Fair in Brooklyn, in 1961 and 1962, and the Black Arts Movement.\\"Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee - Position Paper: The Basis of Black Power\\". The Sixties Project. In 1961, he protested the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, at the United Nations, with Amiri Baraka, Calvin Hicks, Aishah Rahman, Max Roach, Abbey Lincoln, Alex Prempe, Mae Mallory, and Maya Angelou. As an adult, Tour√© shocked readers by publishing a letter denouncing Amiri Baraka's anti-white teaching which he claimed neglected to promote the positive images involving African American culture. In 1967, he joined the faculty at San Francisco State University with Nathan Hare where he taught the country's first Africana studies program. It was during this time in San Francisco that his interest in the National of Islam grew. This interest led to his conversion to Islam in 1970.

Background The album features 12 new and previously unreleased songs and has partnerships with both Chico Amaral and Cesar Mauricio, in addition to the usual partnership with Nando Reis. The album also marks the return of Dudu Marote's production. One highlight is \\"Ainda Gosto Dela\\", featuring Negra Li emerging on the charts. The album also has the participation of the band Funk Como Le Gusta. The album is pop / rock mixed with soul, funk, reggae, surf music and electronic sounds. It marks the return of the group to the tunes of their earlier work, with strong influences from recent Britpop albums. The song \\"Sutilmente\\" has been one of the most acclaimed by fans, surprising even Samuel Rosa. In a video, lyricist Nando Reis explained that he created the lyrics based on a text he had written to the Brazilian edition of Marie Claire in 2005. The work would be featured among texts written by other men invited by the magazine, which asked them to write messages to their loved women. Analysing the lyrics in retrospect, Reis perceived the protagonist as a vain and self-centered person who asks his beloved woman to treat him accordingly to his current state. This lead Reis's wife to nickname it \\"cheek guy song\\" and Reis to see it as the \\"fucked up guy song\\".

This locomotive has monomotor bogies and two-speed gearing A monomotor is a train design where a single traction motor powers two or three axles in the same bogie. Conventional bogie design involves either having one motor for each axle, or having one or more axles unpowered. The monomotor design causes the motor to give both axles the same number of revolutions per minute. Advantages The monomotor design makes it relatively easy to fit a locomotive with two-speed gearing. Low gear is used when hauling freight trains and high gear is used when hauling express passenger trains. Potential problems When both axle's wheels are equally worn, this gives good operating conditions but, as soon as one of the wheels becomes slightly more worn (as is inevitable with steel wheels on steel rails), there will be slippage which causes wear and waste of energy. The problem can be countered by keeping the wheels regularly ground to the same diameter.

Tyler was assigned as a pilot in the 78th Pursuit Squadron at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the day Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. Biography Tyler was born on April 13, 1913, in Oelwein, Iowa. He moved with his family to Long Beach, California, and joined the Civilian Conservation Corps for two years before becoming an Army Air Corps flying cadet in 1936. Pearl Harbor On December 7, 1941, Tyler was a first lieutenant in the Army Air Corps serving as the Executive Officer of the 78th Pursuit Squadron, based at Pearl Harbor. That morning he was assigned duty as the Officer In Charge of the partly activated Pearl Harbor Intercept Center. His duties were to assist the controller in ordering planes to intercept foreign planes, after the planes got in the air. New and untrained at the time, when warned of the approach of a large aircraft flight from the north, Tyler presumed it to be the scheduled arrival of six B-17 bombers from the mainland. The radar operators were tracking Japanese planes coming to attack the base. However the operator, operating in training mode, failed to make clear the size of the formation even though it was larger than anything they'd ever seen, and he did not pass on an alarm of \\"attack imminent\\". Following an investigation by a Naval Board of Inquiry in August 1942, it was determined that Tyler had been assigned to the Information Center with little or no training, no supervision, and no staff with which to work. Tyler was subsequently cleared on any wrongdoing by the Board and no disciplinary actions were taken against him. Later life Tyler retired as a lieutenant colonel in the United States Air Force in 1961. After leaving military service, he obtained a business degree and worked as real estate broker. He died in San Diego, California of pneumonia on January 23, 2010, at the age of 96.

The (then) Washington State College Reactor was the brainchild of Harold W. Dodgen, a former researcher on the Manhattan Project where he earned his PhD from 1943 to 1946. He secured funding for the ambitious 'Reactor Project' from the National Science Foundation, the Atomic Energy Commission, and the College administration totaling $479,000 (roughly $4 million in 2019 dollars). Dodgen's basis for constructing a reactor was that the College was primly located as a training facility for the Hanford site, as well as Idaho National Laboratory because there was no other research reactor in the West at that time. After completing the extensive application and design process with the help of contractors from General Electric they broke ground in August 1957 and the first criticality was achieved on March 7, 1961 at a power level of 1W. They gradually increased power over the next year to achieve their maximum licensed operating power of 100 kW. It was initially a General Electric Materials Test Reactor with plate- type fuel bundles, but was upgraded in 1967 to a 1MW General Atomics TRIGA (Teaching Research Isotopes General Atomics) reactor. Standard TRIGA fuel rods are cylindrical rods, clad in stainless steel utilizing Uranium-235 dispersed in a ceramic zirconium-hydride matrix as fuel.http://www.triga.ga.com The WSUR operated with this TRIGA fuel until the Fuel Life Improvement Program (FLIP) once again upgraded the reactor in 1976 with a partial new core of high- enriched 'TRIGA FLIP' fuel designed for an extended lifetime.http://nrc.wsu.edu/ Two years later, in 1978, due to global fears of nuclear proliferation it was federally mandated that all high-enriched reactor fuel (except for military use) be replaced with Low Enriched Uranium Fuel (LEU).https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/non-power.html Due to the extensive work, cost, and the number of research reactors undergoing the procedure, the WSUR was not converted until October 2008. All FLIP fuel was replaced by another TRIGA fuel known as 30/20 LEU and when the new core went critical on October 7, 2008 it became the world's only mixed 8.5/20 (Standard TRIGA) and 30/20 LEU core.WSUNRC The facility license was renewed for an additional 20 years upon completion of a safety analysis and review. The effective date was September 30, 2011. Design The WSUR core consists of a rectangular aluminum box suspended from a movable bridge structure. Surrounding the core is a 242,000 liter pool of high purity deionized light water, which is used as both a coolant, shield, and moderator. Inside the core box there is a bottom grid- plate into which 3 and 4-rod clusters of TRIGA fuel sit separated by boron- aluminum (Boral, boron carbide in aluminium matrix) control elements. These control elements are raised out of the core via servo-motors to control reactor power. Power is monitored via three different and independent detectors that sit inside the core structure; there is a compensated ion chamber, an uncompensated ion chamber, and a fission chamber in three of the four corners of the grid box.United States. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Research and Test Reactors. Safety Analysis Report for the Washington State University Modified TRIGA Nuclear Reactor. Washington DC: Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 2002. Print. Due to the highly energetic nature of the fission process, a substantial amount of heat is generated during operation (~350 ¬∞C). The fuel is cooled by the natural convection of light water which is circulated through a plate-type heat exchanger with a primary and secondary loop. A cooling tower is utilized to discharge heat from the secondary loop to the environment, ensuring that the system remains well within temperature limits while preventing environmental exposure of water which has contacted the reactor. The WSUR is purely a research reactor, lacking both a pressure vessel and steam turbine which are used to generate electricity in power reactors. The primary use for the WSUR is to generate neutrons which can be used for a multitude of experimental purposes. There are several specialized experimental facilities for Neutron Activation Analysis and isotope production (see below), and several generalized sample rotator tubes whereby samples are lowered into the core for a set time, then pulled back out and sent to the laboratory where the data analysis will take place. Pulsing Like many TRIGA reactors, the WSUR has the ability to pulse. Ordinarily the WSUR runs at a steady state power level of 1MW, however because of the unique characteristics of TRIGA fuel it can be pulsed to approximately 1000 times this power for a very short amount of time. This ability is due to the fact that TRIGA fuel is designed with a prompt negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, which means that as the fuel heats up, it becomes less and less reactive (it shuts itself down). So when one of the control elements (known as the transient rod) is ejected from the core via air pressure at high speeds, the reactor jumps in power from ~80 watts to over a 1 billion watts and back down again in 50 milliseconds, causing a bright blue flash of Cerenkov radiation. There is a video of this effect on the WSUNSC webpage (see references). Research Neutron activation analysis is a method used to determine elemental concentrations in unknown samples. It is especially useful for determining amounts of heavy metals (to parts per billion) in samples that are often as small as 10 mg. The WSUR can even do NAA research by pulsing samples.Payne, R. F.; Drader, J. A.; Friese, J. I.; Greenwood, L. R.; Hines, C. C.; Metz, L. A.; Kephart, J. D.; King, M. D.; Pierson, B. D.; Smith, J. D.; Wall, D. E. \\"Neutron Fluence and Energy Reproducibility of a 2-Dollar TRIGA Reactor Pulse,\\" J. Radioanal. Nucl. Chem., 2009, 282, 59-62. Examples of past research projects that have used this unique and valuable analysis method include determining quantities of toxic metals, such as arsenic, zinc, and selenium in air filters, tree rings, and other environmental samples. NAA can also be used to find trace elements in biological materials. This can be especially useful in plant or animal nutrient and health studies. Argon dating of geological samples can even be performed using the reactor and associated NAA equipment. The WSUR also uses the neutrons it generates to produce isotopes for various other fields. Epithermal neutron beam facility The WSU TRIGA reactor has an external epithermal neutron beam facility. This beam is a well-collimated, high-flux, medium energy dry neutron beam. It can also be modified to generate low energy neutrons. This beam facility is enclosed in a special high-radiation area room, and was built in conjunction with the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory for cancer research. Ongoing projects include Boron-Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) research, especially that research for a cure for brain tumors, although the beam can be used for any neutron-capture therapy. This beam can also be used for neutron radiography, a non-destructive technique for examining 'heavy' materials such as steel for internal 'light' materials, such as cracks in castings, voids in welds, or fluid flows inside pipes.Nigg, D. W.; Venhizen, J. R.; Wemble, C. A.; Tripard, G. E.; Sharp, S.; Fox, K. \\"Flux and Instrumentation Upgrade for the Epithermal Neutron Beam Facility at Washington State University,\\" Appl. Radiat. Isot. 2004, 61.5, 993-996. Cobalt-60 source The cobalt-60 gamma irradiator is also housed in the reactor pool and is a separate system from the reactor itself. The WSU College of Veterinary Medicine, as well as several Biology graduate students use the source as a means for sterilization of biological samples as it is much cheaper and faster than an autoclave.

SPDY manipulates HTTP traffic, with particular goals of reducing web page load latency and improving web security. SPDY achieves reduced latency through compression, multiplexing, and prioritization, although this depends on a combination of network and website deployment conditions. The name \\"SPDY\\" is a trademark of Google and is not an acronym. Throughout the process, the core developers of SPDY have been involved in the development of HTTP/2, including both Mike Belshe and Roberto Peon. In February 2015, Google announced that following the recent final ratification of the HTTP/2 standard, support for SPDY would be deprecated, and that support for SPDY would be withdrawn. Google removed SPDY support in Google Chrome 51. Mozilla removed it in Firefox 50. Apple has deprecated the technology in macOS 10.14.4 and iOS 12.2.  History  , the group developing SPDY stated publicly that it was working toward standardisation (available as an Internet Draft). The first draft of HTTP/2 used SPDY as the working base for its specification draft and editing. Implementations of SPDY exist in Chromium, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Amazon Silk, Internet Explorer, and Safari, with the implementations for Chromium and Firefox being open source software. In February 2015, Google announced its plans to remove support for SPDY in favor of HTTP/2. HTTP/2 was first discussed when it became apparent that SPDY was gaining traction with implementers (like Mozilla and nginx), and was showing significant improvements over HTTP/1.x. After a call for proposals and a selection process, SPDY was chosen as the basis for HTTP/2. Since then, there have been a number of changes, based on discussion in the Working Group and feedback from implementers. On February 11, 2016, Google announced that Chrome would no longer support SPDY and NPN after May 15, 2016, the anniversary of RFC 7540. On January 25, 2019, Apple announced that SPDY would be deprecated in favor of HTTP/2, and would be removed in future releases.  Design  The goal of SPDY is to reduce web page load time. This is achieved by prioritizing and multiplexing the transfer of web page subresources so that only one connection per client is required. TLS encryption is nearly ubiquitous in SPDY implementations, and transmission headers are gzip- or DEFLATE-compressed by design (in contrast to HTTP, where the headers are sent as human-readable text). Moreover, servers may hint or even push content instead of awaiting individual requests for each resource of a web page. SPDY requires the use of SSL/TLS (with TLS extension ALPN) for security but it also supports operation over plain TCP. The requirement for SSL is for security and to avoid incompatibility when communication is across a proxy.  Relation to HTTP  SPDY does not replace HTTP; it modifies the way HTTP requests and responses are sent over the wire. This means that all existing server-side applications can be used without modification if a SPDY-compatible translation layer is put in place. SPDY is effectively a tunnel for the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. When sent over SPDY, HTTP requests are processed, tokenized, simplified and compressed. For example, each SPDY endpoint keeps track of which headers have been sent in past requests and can avoid resending the headers that have not changed; those that must be sent are compressed. The IETF working group for HTTPbis has released the draft of HTTP/2. SPDY (draft-mbelshe-httpbis-spdy-00) was chosen as the starting point.  Protocol support  For use within HTTPS, SPDY needs the TLS extension Next Protocol Negotiation (NPN),NPN protocol and explanation about its need to tunnel SPDY over HTTPS. thus browser and server support depends on the HTTPS library. OpenSSL 1.0.1 or greater introduces NPN.Openssl 1.0.1 changelog. Patches to add NPN support have also been written for NSS and TLSLite.TLS Next Protocol Negotiation. Section: Implementations . SPDY is scheduled to switch from NPN to Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) before the end of 2014. Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) from Microsoft have not implemented the NPN extension to its TLS implementation. This has prevented SPDY inclusion in the latest .NET Framework versions. Since SPDY specification is being refined and HTTP/2 is expected to include SPDY implementation one could expect Microsoft to release support after HTTP/2 is finalized.  Protocol versions  SPDY is a versioned protocol. In its control frames there are 15 dedicated bits to indicate the version of the session protocol. * Version 1: version 1 of the SPDY protocol is not used anymore.SPDY Protocol - Draft 2: \\"Currently, the only valid string is \\"spdy/2\\" (spdy/1 isn't implemented anywhere anymore)\\". * Version 2: soon to be discontinued.

SPDY protocol functionality can be (de)activated by toggling \\"Enable SPDY/4\\" setting on local \`chrome://flags\` page. Chromium is expected to remove support for SPDY and Next Protocol Negotiation in early 2016, in favor of HTTP/2 and ALPN. Starting with version 40.x in Feb 2015 Chrome has already dropped support for SPDY/3 and only supports SPDY/3.1 going forward. This has caused Apache websites to be without SPDY support when visited from Google Chrome. * Firefox supports SPDY 2 from version 11, and default-enabled since 13 and later. (Also SeaMonkey version 2.8+.) SPDY protocol functionality can be (de)activated by toggling the \`network.http.spdy.enabled\` variable in \`about:config\`. Firefox 15 added support for SPDY 3. Firefox 27 has added SPDY 3.1 support. Firefox 28 has removed support of SPDY 2. \`about:networking\` (or the HTTP/2 and SPDY indicator add-on) shows if a website uses SPDY. * Opera browser added support for SPDY as of version 12.10. * Internet Explorer 11 added support for SPDY version 3, but not for the Windows 7 version. A problem experienced by some users of Windows 8.1 and Internet Explorer 11 is that on initial loading, Google says \\"Page not found\\" but on reloading, it is fine. One fix for this is to disable SPDY/3 in Internet Options > Advanced. After version 11, IE will drop the support of SPDY, as it will adopt HTTP/2. * Amazon's Silk browser for the Kindle Fire uses the SPDY protocol to communicate with their EC2 service for Web pages rendering. * Safari 8 and third-party applications in OS X 10.10 and iOS 8 adds support for SPDY 2, 3 and 3.1.  Server support and usage  , approximately 7.1% of all websites support SPDY. Fielded versions of the two most popular web servers, NGINX and Apache, are the major providers of SPDY traffic. although the latest version of NGINX has now removed SPDY support. This compares with an adoption rate of 8.1% for the newer HTTP/2 protocol, which had overtaken the adoption of SPDY. Some Google services (e.g. Google search, Gmail, and other SSL-enabled services) use SPDY when available.spdy- dev mailing list: SPDY on Google servers?.

He and his brother Dong-Hyek Lim won third prize at the 2005 International Frederick Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw. Dong Min Lim studied at the Moscow Conservatory, at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik, Theater und Medien Hannover and at Mannes College The New School for Music. Starting in September 2009, he is a professor at Keimyung University, Korea. Childhood Unlike other famous pianists in the world, Lim started playing the piano at the age of nine. However, within two years he had won various competitions in South Korea such as Samick Piano Competition. While he was studying in Sun Hwa Arts School with the full scholarship at age 14, he moved to Moscow in 1994 to study at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Moscow,with his parents. He continued his studies with Professor Lev Naumov. Since he was young, he participated in most of the top competitions in Europe. At that time, Lim got a message of congratulations by Kim Young-sam, the president of Korea at that moment. Awards Lim had received plenty of awards in well-known competitions. In 1996, at age 16, he was the winner of the Chopin Competition for Young Pianists in Moscow (his brother Dong-Hyek Lim was in second place). In 1998, he was in the final round of International Tchaikovsky Competition for young adults. Also, he was placed as the third in International Vioti Competition . Moreover, in 2001, he was placed as the third in The International Piano Competition Ferruccio Busoni, Italy when there was no winner. He also took the fifth prize at the 2002 International Tchaikovsky Competition. Here, he was the third person in Korean history after Myung-whun Chung (Ï†ïÎ™ÖÌõà) and Hae-Sun Beak (Î∞±ÌòúÏÑ†) to be on the top list. In 2005, Lim participated in the 15th International Frederick Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw announcing that this competition would be the last competition. At the end, he tied (having exactly the same decimal numbers) the third prize with his brother Dong-Hyek Lim (while there was no second prize) as the first Koreans in the history to be on the first five list. Performing Style The performing styles of Dong- Min and Dong-Hyek Lim are very contrasting from each other. While Dong-Min Lim‚Äôs performing style is soft, light, and flexible, which gives the audience a comfort sound to hear, Dong-Hyek Lim has more characteristic sound (sound of his own), using a lot of good techniques while he is playing a piece.

Composed in 1921‚Äì22, it was given its premi√®re at the Vienna State Opera on 9 May 1924. Background While serving as co-director of the Vienna State Opera with Franz Schalk from 1919 until 1924, Strauss sought to revive the fortunes of the resident ballet company, struggling after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. He recruited choreographer Heinrich Kr√∂ller (1880‚Äì1930) from the Berlin State Opera and collaborated with him on a series of productions, restaging his earlier work for the Ballets Russes Josephslegende (1922), and rearranging the music of Schumann, Fran√ßois Couperin, Beethoven, and Gluck for, respectively, Karneval (1922), Ballettsoir√©e (1923), Die Ruinen von Athen (1924), and Don Juan (1924). Most ambitious was Schlagobers, premiered during the official celebrations for the composer's sixtieth birthday. Scenario A group of children celebrate their confirmation in a Konditorei or Viennese cake shop, where many of the confections come alive, with marzipan marches and cocoa dances. Having overindulged, one boy falls ill and hallucinates, leading to the party of Princess Pralin√©e, a trio of amorous liquors, and a riot of cakes pacified by beer. The scenario is somewhat reminiscent of The Nutcracker, which remained unperformed in the West until 1929. Music Strauss' score employs a thematic-developmental treatment of motifs and was, according to contemporary critic Julius Korngold, \\"too elaborately artistic, too massive and heavily developed, and not dancerly enough... The light whipped cream is whisked in a gaudy bowl.\\" Premiere Kr√∂ller's choreography may be partially reconstructed from surviving drawings and dance notation, while sketches of many of the 287 costumes and sets created by the house designers have survived. The extravagance of the production, costing some four billion Kronen ‚Äì a contemporary new staging of Wagner's Rienzi cost by contrast only two hundred million ‚Äì led to it being dubbed the Milliardenballett or \\"billionaire's ballet\\", and at a time of food-shortages and hyperinflation, may in part explain its troubled reception. Strauss observed, in response to the poor reviews, \\"I cannot bear the tragedy of the present time. I want to create joy.\\" Political subtext While in the final version the three amorous liquors are Marianne Chartreuse, Ladislaw Slivovitz, and Boris Wutki, representatives of France, Poland and Russia, the original intent was to have the German Michel Schnapps instead winning Marianne's hand, a symbol of political reconciliation or even resurgent German virility, written out after the Occupation of the Ruhr. Also in earlier sketches, red banners were waved amidst the riotous proletarian cakes, with the Revolution Polka conducted by matzos. Recordings There is a recording of the full ballet by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Hiroshi Wakasugi, on the Denon label. The composer also recorded the waltzes from the ballet with the Vienna Philharmonic. Other productions The American Ballet Theatre mounted their first production of the ballet in 2017 at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City; Alexei Ratmansky provided the choreography and Mark Ryden designed set and costumes.\\"Whipped Cream, the 'Billionaire's Ballet', Makes a Sweet Debut at the Metropolitan Opera House\\" by Amy Fine Collins, Vanity Fair, 18 May 2017 That production was also shown at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC,\\"American Ballet Theatre's Whipped Cream: A fleeting sugar high\\" by Sarah L.

During first years. he ruled together with his brother Marko, holding the regions of inner Serbia (Ra≈°ka, lat. Rascia). With the death of his cousin, king Constantine Bodin of Duklja in 1101, he became the most powerful ruler among Serbian princes. He defeated the Byzantines several times, conquering parts of northern Macedonia. He is the eponymous founder of the Vukanoviƒá dynasty. Biography Vukan was the first-born of Petrislav, the son of King Mihailo I and his second Greek wife.The early medieval Balkans, p. 223 He and his brother Marko swore an oath of loyalty to Constantine Bodin and took power as his vassals in Serbia in 1083 or 1084. Marko later disappears from sources. Neither Bosnia, Zachlumia nor Ra≈°ka were ever permanently integrated into the Kingdom of Duklja. Each region had its own nobility and institutions and acquired a Vojislavljeviƒá to head as ≈Ωupan. In 1089, Bodin managed to raise the bishopric of Bar to an Archbishopric, by supporting the pope against an antipope. The suffragan bishops were to be: Kotor, Ulcinj, Svac, Skadar, Drivast, Pula, Ras, Bosnia and Trebinje. In obtaining its promotion, it acquired a much larger diocese, including territory that earlier had not been under the pope ‚Äì territories of the metropolitan of Durazzo and Archbishop of Ochrid, two sees that recognized the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Bar Archbishopric's new territory were merely theoretical ‚Äì the pope's edict could only affect the churches that recognized Rome. Making Serbia a suffragan to Bar had little meaning, as most of its churches were under Constantinople, and there is no evidence of Vukan changing adherence to Rome. Durazzo and Ochrid may have suffered minimal territorial losses along the coast, Duklja was briefly a subject to Rome, however inland Duklja was not affected, and along with much of Duklja's coast (like most of Kotor) was to retain its loyalty to Orthodoxy. A Byzantine campaign was launched against Duklja between 1089 and 1091, possibly managing to take Bodin captive for a second time.The early medieval Balkans, p. 224 Civil war broke out in the realm among Bodin's relatives, greatly weakening Duklja, giving the chance for inner Serbia (Ra≈°ka) to assert itself and break away. Vukan asserts independence, as well as Bosnia and Zahumlje. Up to this point, Duklja had been the center of the Serbian realm, as well as the main resistance to Byzantium in the Balkans. Inner Serbia became the most powerful of Serbian states, remaining so throughout the Middle Ages.The early medieval Balkans, p. 225 Inner Serbia (Ra≈°ka) gradually replaced Duklja as the main opponent of Byzantine rule in the 12th century. Bodin's heirs were forced to recognize Byzantine overlordship, and had now only the small territory of Duklja and Travunia. In 1091 or 1092, Vukan became independent, taking the title of Grand Prince (Veliki ≈Ωupan). His state was centered on present-day Novi Pazar. Subordinate to him were local dukes (≈Ωupan, holding a territory equivalent of a county), who seem to have been more or less autonomous in the internal affairs of their counties, but who were obliged to be loyal to Vukan, and supporting him in battle. It seems that the dukes were hereditary holders of their counties, holding their land before Duklja annexed inner Serbia (Ra≈°ka). In about 1090, Vukan began raiding Byzantine territory, first in the vicinity of Kosovo. Initially the Byzantines were unable to take steps against Vukan, as they faced a serious threat in the invading Pechenegs.The early medieval Balkans, p. 226 On 29 April 1091, the Byzantines destroyed the Pecheneg force. With the defeat of the Pechenegs, Alexios I Komnenos could now turn to the Serbs. Vukan launched his conquest of Kosovo from the Zveƒçan Fortress Alexios I first sent an army with the strategos of Durazzo, which was defeated by Vukan in 1092. The Emperor now mobilized a much larger army, led by himself, marching onto inner Serbia (Ra≈°ka). Vukan sends envoys, seeking peace which Alexios I quickly accepted, as a new problem had arisen at home in the Cumans who plundered the lands as far as Adrianople. Immediately after the Emperor's departure, Vukan breaks the treaty, and began to expand along the Vardar, obtaining much booty and taking the cities of Vranje, Skopje and Tetovo. In 1094 or 1095, Alexios I marched out to meet the Serbs. Vukan and his dukes arrive at the Emperor's tent and offer peace, with his own son Uros I as hostage (throughout the 12th century it was usual for relatives of the Grand Prince to stay at the imperial court as hostages of peace). At this time, Serbian principality was independent ‚Äì Vukan acted entirely on his own, no longer a vassal of Duklja. Duklja, because of its civil war, did not involve itself in the Serbian-Byzantine wars. Vukan again marched south, into Macedonia. Alexios could not do anything about him as the Crusade took place. In 1106 Vukan submitted to Alexios.The early medieval Balkans, p. 228 Following Bodin's death in 1101, Bodin's half-brother Dobroslav II succeeded him as king of Duklja. Koƒçopar Branislavljeviƒá, Bodin's first cousin once removed, travelled from Dyrrhachium to Ra≈°ka, forging an alliance with Vukan. This alliance would prove worthy in their successful invasion of Duklja in 1102. The battle that ensued at the Moraƒça led to the overthrow of Dobroslav II and the coronation of Koƒçopar to the throne. Dobroslav was subsequently banished to Ra≈°ka. However, Koƒçopar's reign was short-lived as well as Vukan had been planning to install Bodin's nephew, Vladimir to the throne of Duklja. Koƒçopar, having lost influence among the Zachlumoi, married the daughter of a Zachlumian (Bosnian) prince (knez). However, in the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, the chronicler specifically mentioned that at the time, Zachlumia was ruled by a ban, not a knez. Koƒçopar later died in battle against the Zachlumoi. Upon his death, Vukan installed Bodin's nephew Vladimir as planned, to whom he gave his daughter as a wife and so strengthened ties between Ra≈°ka and Duklja. A mere pawn in dynastic conflicts, Vladimir was poisoned in 1118 under orders from Queen Jaquinta, widow of his late uncle, Constantine Bodin. Jaquinta then appointed her son, George, to the throne of Duklja. Upon spreading his influence in Duklja, Vukan invaded Byzantium once more in the spring of 1106. He was probably attempting to take advantage of the Norman campaign against the Byzantines (see Byzantine‚ÄìNorman wars). In a battle, he defeated John II Komnenos again. The war was concluded by November of that year, with Vukan being forced to send hostages once again to emperor Alexios I in return for peace. There is no written record of Vukan after this war. Scholars believe Vukan died after 1112. Vukan's successor was Uro≈° I his nephew through Marko. Notes References Sources ;Primary sources  Anna Comnena, The Alexiad, translated by Elizabeth A.

This out-of-court procedure was established in Japan in 2007 and is based on Japanese Law, specifically the Special Measures Law for Industrial Revitalization and Rebirth of Japan. It allows companies to forgo bankruptcy proceedings and replaces previous voluntary debt adjustments under such as the \\"Guideline for Voluntary Debt Adjustment\\" (Shiteki Seiri Guideline). Although the procedure is named using the generic alternative dispute resolution title, Turnaround ADR is not a procedure for resolving disputes. Rather, it offers a way for financially stressed companies to reassess and restructure debts.  Features  When a Turnaround ADR is applied, the debtor can maintain payment to business partners and customers. Only claims held by financial institutions participating in this procedure become subject to adjustment; if the relevant institutions reach consensus, the debts can be minimized. Turnaround ADR is frequently misunderstood in the United States and other Western nations because no equivalent procedure exists there. Applying for or initiating a Turnaround ADR is not considered a default triggering event. Rather, adopting a Turnaround ADR is considered a preferable procedure for financially distressed companies as it provides breathing space for such companies to focus on revitalizing their business. Such space is gained by the alleviation of debts against relevant financial institutions without adversely affecting integral business relationships with partners and customers. A private operator certified by the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, provides mediation services in a Turnaround ADR. The Japanese Association of Turnaround Professionals (JATP) is the only private operator certified to provide mediation services for Turnaround ADR. In this role, JATP normally appoints a mediator from a network of corporate turnaround professionals. This mediator is responsible for implementing the Turnaround ADR procedure fairly and objectively.

(1993). Religious Policy in the Soviet Union. Cambridge University Press. p. 4 While it never officially made religion illegal, the state nevertheless made great efforts to reduce the prevalence of religious belief within society. To this end, at various times in its history it engaged in anti-religious persecutions of varying intensity and methodology. Believers were never officially attacked for being believers, but they were officially attacked for real or perceived political opposition to the state and to its policies.Letters of Metropolitan Sergii of Vilnius at en.wikisource.org. These attacks, however, in the broader ideological context were ultimately meant to serve the ultimate goal of eliminating religion, and the perceived political opposition acted as a legal pretext to carry this out. Thus, although the Soviet Union was officially a secular state and guaranteed freedom of religion in its constitutions, in practice believers suffered discrimination and were widely attacked for promoting religion. As part of its anti-religious campaigns, the Soviet state enacted a significant body of legislation that regulated and curtailed religious practices. This, along with many secret instructions that were not published, formed the legal basis for the Soviet state's anti-religious stance. Laws were designed in order to hurt and hamper religious activities, and the state often vigilantly watched religious believers for their breaking of these laws to justify arresting them. In some places, volunteer neighbourhood committees, called \\"public commissions for control over observance on the laws about religious cults\\", watched their religious neighbours and reported violations of the law to the appropriate authorities. The state sought to control religious bodies through such laws with the intention of making those bodies disappear. Often such laws incorporated many ambiguities that allowed for the state to abuse them in order to persecute believers. This article lists and discusses some of the most important legislation below, although this list is by no means comprehensive. The Russian Civil War and the first anti-religious campaign (1917‚Äì1928) =Legislation that preceded Lenin's Decree on the Separation of Church and State= From November 1917 until Lenin's Decree on the Separation of Church and State in January 1918, legislative measures against religion were enacted. Among important Acts included: i) Act of the Commissar of Education, 11 December 1917: ... It is declared that all control of educational matters shall be handed over to the Commissariat of Education from all religious organizations. All church/parish schools, teachers colleges, religious colleges and seminaries, ... all missionary schools, [and] all academies ... with all of their property, both movable and immovable, i.e. with all buildings ... land, with all gardens, with all libraries ... valuables, capital and vulnerable papers ... and with all that was credited to the above-mentioned schools and institutions, shall likewise be handed over to the Commissariat of Education. ... (Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars VI Lenin). ii) Decree on the Dissolution of Marriage (Divorce), 18 December 1917: ... 12 ... All records currently in the possession of any religious organization are to be handed over to the local courts without delay. ... All decisions regarding the dissolution of marriage already made or in the process of being ruled upon by any religious organization or by any of its representatives, are hereby declared destroyed and not valid, they are to be decided upon by the local courts upon their taking possession of the appropriate records. Parties not wishing to wait until this takes place have the right to issue a new petition for the dissolution of their marriage as described by this decree. ... (Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars VI Lenin) iii) Decree on Civic Marriages, on Children, and on the Introduction of Books or Records, 18 December 1917: The Russian Republic from now on recognizes only civil marriages. ... (Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars VI Lenin) iv) Order of the People's Commissar of Military Affairs No. 39, 16 January 1918, On the prohibition of all powers of religious departments: # All religious ministers and practisers currently employed by war departments are discharged. # All powers of military clergy are dissolved. # War committees have the right to retain religious ministers, providing this is in accordance with the desires of their members. # In the above case the support of such a minister will be entirely up to the concerned committees. # All wealth and property of military churches, without exception, is to be handed over to the war committees of the units involved for safe-keeping. v) Order of the People's Commissar of Welfare, 20 January 1918: The distribution of subsidies for the maintenance of churches, chapels, and for the operations of religious orders are to be halted. Governmental support of clergy and teachers of religion is to be halted as of 1 March of this year. ... Church services and the fulfillment of the needs of believers may be continued on the condition of an expressed desire by collectives of believers who must assume the full cost of repairs and maintenance of churches, [and] of all inventory and all servers. (People's Commissar A. Kollontai) This meant that religious communities from then onward had to rely entirely upon the voluntary support of its laity in order to continue existence. =1918 Legislation= Lenin's important 1918 Decree on the Separation of Church and State was followed by another body of legislation. Lenin's legislative acts would form what would be called the 'Leninist legality' and would be considered a milestone and a reference point for later anti-religious campaigns and thought. Among key legislation passed included: i) Separation of the Church from the State and the Schools from the Church: Decree of the Soviet of People's Commissars, 12 January 1918:Chamberlin, William Henry (15 September 1929). Soviet Russia: A Living Record and a History. XIII. \\"THE STRUGGLE FOR THE RUSSIAN SOUL\\". Boston: Little, Brown, and Company. pp. 306‚Äì323. # The Church is separated from the State. # Within the territory of the Republic, it is forbidden to pass any local laws or regulations which would restrain or limit the freedom of conscience or which would grant special rights or privileges on the basis of the religious confession of citizens. # Every citizen may confess any religion or profess none at all. Every legal restriction connected with the profession of no faith is now revoked. #:Note: in all official documents every mention of a citizen's religious affiliation or nonaffiliation shall be removed. # The actions of the government or other organizations of public law may not be accompanied by any religious rites or ceremonies. # The free performance of religious rites is granted as long as it does not disturb public order or infringe upon the rights of citizens of the Soviet Republic. In such cases the local authorities are entitled to take the necessary measures to secure public order and safety. According to Riho Altnurme, 'disturbing public order' was used as grounds to outlaw religions sects with 'extreme mysticism' such as Skoptsy, Hlysty, Pentecostals and Jehovah's Witnesses.Altnurme, Riho (2002). Religious cults, particularly Lutheranism, in the Soviet Union in 1944-1949. Trames 6.1. # * No one may refuse to carry out his citizen's duties on the grounds of his religious views. # Religious vows or oaths are abolished. In necessary situations a ceremonial promise will suffice. # The acts of civil status are registered exclusively by the civil authorities at the departments for the registration of marriages and births. # The school is separated from the church. The teaching of religious doctrines in all state and public schools, or in private educational institutions where general subjects are taught, is prohibited. Citizens may receive and give religious instructions privately. # All ecclesiastical and religious associations are subject to the same general regulations to private associations and unions, and shall not enjoy any benefits, nor any subsidies either from the Government, nor from any of its autonomous or self-governing institutions. # Religious organizations are prohibited from calling obligatory gatherings for its members, from establishing membership dues, and from disciplining any of its members in any way. According to Gregory Freeze, church hierarchies and dioceses could not legally exist under Soviet law, and therefore if believers received instruction from priests or bishops as though such people were spiritual authorities, they could be punished along with the offending clergymen. In effect this made it extremely difficult for dioceses to be run except in a chaotic fashion; it also allowed for laity to assert increasing control over their churches and sometimes to have conflicts with the hierarchy as a result (and such conflicts were encouraged by the state). # * No church or religious organizations are permitted to own property. They do not have the rights of a legal person. # Any and all property that any church or religious organization may in Russia is hereby declared to be public property. Buildings and objects required specifically for religious ceremonies, are to be given only by special decrees by either local or central governmental powers, for free use for the appropriate religious organization.

(1918) Article Two: General Provisions of the Constitution of the Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic. Chapter Five: # * For the purpose of securing to the workers real freedom of conscience, the church is to be separated from the state and the school from the church, and the right of religious and anti-religious propaganda is accorded to every citizen.Russian Constitution of 1918. This right to carry out religious propaganda was limited by censorship in 1918 up until the right was later removed. Church presses were confiscated and virtually all church periodicals were shut down; the hierarchy was denied much ability to influence lay opinion in the hope that this would sow discord and confusion in the church. The Constitution was later modified in 1929, and the right of religious groupings to carry out religious propaganda was taken away, and it was made completely illegal to try to defend religion against atheist arguments or to engage in public discussion on religion. In its place the language read (Article 52) that all citizens had a right to \\"conduct religious worship or atheist propaganda\\". Article Four: The Right to Vote. Chapter Thirteen: # * The following persons enjoy neither the right to vote nor the right to be voted for, even though they belong to one of the categories enumerated above, namely: #:(b) Persons who have an income without doing any work, such as interest from capital, receipts from property, etc.; #:(d) Monks and clergy of all denominations;Russian Constitution of 1918 iii) Declaration of the People's Commissar of Education, 17 February 1918: All teachers of religion of all religions are relieved of all of their duties and responsibilities as of the 1st of January 1918. (People's Commissar AV Lunacharsky) iv) Declaration by the People's Commissar of Public Property, 14 January 1918: The Court Clergy is abolished. The protection of Court churches, as artistic and national monuments, is temporarily assigned to the Committees and Commissars of those places and institutions to which the churches are attached. If any religious society declares a desire to celebrate in those churches, then it will have to take upon itself the full cost of supporting the clergy, other religious servers and other associated costs ... (Deputy People's Commissar Iu. Flakeerman) v) Declaration of the People's Commissar of Justice, 24 August 1918: # * The minimum of local citizens required, in order to receive the use of religious property, shall be set by the local Soviet of Worker and Peasant Deputies, but this number may not be less than 20. The fact that, this was a 'minimum' and there was no stated 'maximum', allowed for local authorities to set the minimum number at a high level. # * Those who take upon themselves the use of a church building are obligated to: ... in the event of the revelation by the Soviet of Worker and Peasant Deputies of embezzlement or ill usage of lent property, immediately give up said property to the Soviet of Worker and Peasant Deputies upon their first demand. ... # * All local citizens of the corresponding faith have the right to ... take part in the administration of the church property to the same degree as the founders of the association. This allowed for local authorities to fill a religious building's administration with citizens and thereby take control of the parish or faith community, even to the extent of 'voluntarily' shutting down the building. # * In government and all publicly administered buildings, it is, without exception, forbidden to: #:a) hold religious functions or ceremonies (prayer services, funerals, etc.); #:b) house any sort of religious items (icons, pictures, statues of a religious nature, etc.). # * Religious processions, and the carrying-out of any sort of religious functions outside, is allowed only with written permission from the local Soviet authority, which must be obtained for each separate occasion. ... (People's Commissar D. Kursky) USSR anti-religious campaign (1928‚Äì1941) =Laws on Separation of Church and State from 1929= i) Act #259 of the People's Commissar of Internal Affairs, 30 July 1929: # * ... for former church/parish houses or former monastery buildings, if they are rented out to workers, they will be responsible for all repairs, and they must be charged rent equivalent to the devaluation of the property. This is to be considered as 1 per cent of the current construction cost for stone buildings, and 2 per cent for wooden buildings. For tenants living off non-labour income, including religious servers, the rent shall be determined as the cost of the devaluation of the property plus the interest upon the cost of the construction of the building, assumed to be up to 10 per cent per year, depending upon local condition and the situation of the tenant. According to Dimitry Pospielovsky, this meant that religious minister could be charged from 5 to 10 times the rent that would be required from workers for the same property. ii) Act of the All-Russian Central Administrative Committee and Soviet of People's Commissars RSFSR, 8 April 1929: # Persons living off non-labour income ... exceeding 3000 roubles per year, living in nationalized or municipally owned housing, cannot have their leases extended past the 1st of October 1929 ... they must be moved out without being offered alternative living space. # * In all municipally owned or nationalized housing ... it is from now on forbidden to rent out space to those on non-labour incomes. It is also likewise forbidden to sublet, or take in as boarders those living on non-labour incomes. Pospielovsky argued that a priest could not live with a parishioner or relative in government-owned housing. iii) Decree of SNK RSFSR #23-24, 1929: # All cemeteries.. and all funeral organizations are hereby placed in the control of local Soviet deputies. (People's Commissar of Internal Affairs Tolmachev) =Laws Concerning the Taxation of Religious Cults and their Employees= High taxes on religious buildings and clergy were meant to cripple the religious bodies financially. i) Circular NKF USSR #398, 10 September 1929: # Buildings, assigned for religious use ... and supplied free of charge for use to religious organizations, are subject to local taxes ... # * ... nonpayment of taxes on time will result in the confiscation of the building.

(Assistant Head of Taxation the RSFSR People's Commissariat of Finance Starobinsky) = Laws Concerning Civil Obligations = These come from the latter part of the 1920s. i) Law on military obligations, 1 September 1928: Section 1: ... The armed defence of the USSR shall be carried out only by the workers. Non-worker elements are charged with the fulifillment of other tasks for the defence of the USSR. Section 236: Citizens, free from military service on religious ground ... are to be assigned to: in peacetime ‚Äì public benefiting work (combating natural disasters, epidemics, etc.) ... and in wartime ‚Äì special brigades for the servicing of the front and rear. Local courts freed people from military service. The Central Committee and the Soviet of People's Commissars of the USSR decrees: # Citizens assigned to home front service ... in peacetime are subject to a special military tax for the duration of their home front service designation. # ... the rate of tax shall be as follows: ... for those with an income up to 1800 roubles ‚Äì the equivalent of 50 per cent of their income tax; with an income up to 3000 roubles ‚Äì 75 per cent of their income tax; over 3000 roubles ‚Äì 100 per cent of their income tax ... but the special tax shall not exceed 20 per cent of the person's taxable income. # * The special military tax shall be collected for the first five-year period of one's home front service designation, and after this ‚Äì for one year of every six years of home front service designation. (Moscow, Kremlin, 10 April 1929) ii) Instruction for the Fulfilment of [the above] Decree, 25 April 1929: # * The maximum age for being designated for home front service is 40 ... (Assistant Head of Taxation) iii) Instruction on the Elections to the Soviets, Confirmed by the Presidium of the Central Committee, 4 November 1926: # * Servers of cults of all religions and beliefs, including: monks, novices, deacons, psalmists, mullahs, rabbis, lamas, shamans, pastors ... and all those who fulfill similar functions, are denied voting privileges ... Family members of those whose voting privileges are suspended, and if the source of their income is social benefiting labour ... iv) Act of the Central Committee and the Soviet of People's Commissars, 11 January 1928: All Citizens of the USSR, who possess voting privileges ... may organize consumer organizations to serve their consumer and household needs ... According to Pospielovsky, all clergy members (e.g. the people mentioned in the above list who had their voting rights deprived) could not form, participate or benefit from consumer organizations. This was very critical in some places of the country, since it was essential to be a member of such an organization in order to have access to any consumer goods. v) Confirmation of the Central Committee, 15 December 1928: ... Those whose voting privileges have been suspended, have the last and lowest priority in land distribution for use ... Members of land organizations are considered all those who ... possess voting privileges ... Pospielovsky argued that land organizations assigned land for all use. T his meant that the clergy and non-voting members could not have a say in land allocation. This was a very harsh measure against rural clergy who often depended on small gardens and farms for their survival. If rural clergy did receive land from the land organization it was usually the worst land available, that no one else wanted. In 1936, this unequal status was repealed by Article 124 of the new constitution, also known as the \\"Stalin\\" constitution, which redesigned the government of the Soviet Union. Article 124 restored equal political rights to clergy (allowing them to run for office as well) on grounds that not all clergy were hostile to the regime and under the belief that the Soviet public ought to have been sufficiently 're-educated' by that point so as not to vote for people hostile to the regime.Fitzpatrick, Sheila (1999). Everyday Stalinism: Ordinary Life in Extraordinary Times: Soviet Russia in the 1930s. New York: Oxford University Press, 179. vi) Act of the Soviet of People's Commissars of the USSR, 24 September 1929: # In all industries ... [and] in all institutions, that operate year-round ... the five-day work week (four days of work and one day of rest) is to be introduced ... According to Pospielovsky, since only every Sunday was a day of rest, this made it impossible to have regular Sunday church attendance. The celebration of holidays such as Christmas or Easter was also hampered by mandatory work on those days. = The Laws on Religious Associations (LRA) of 8 April 1929 = A new volume of anti-religious legislation was introduced in 1929 due to the failure of the anti-religious campaign in the previous decade and the successful resistance that the church was able to fight against the atheistic propaganda. The legislation would form part of the basis for the harsh persecution that would be carried out in the 1930s. This 1929 legislation formed the main legal basis for the governing of religious activities in the USSR. It would be added to by the Instruction on the Supervision over the Fulfillment of Religious Cults in 1961 and the 1965 Statue of the Council for Religious Affairs (CRA). The 1929 laws would be amended later in 1975. The 1929 legislation effectively curtailed the church's public presence and mostly limited religious activities to services conducted within religious buildings only. # * A religious society is a local association of believers at least 18 years of age, belonging to the same religious cult, faith, orientation or sect, numbering no less than twenty persons, having come together for the joint satisfaction of their religious needs. According to Christel Lane and the United States Department of State Bulletin of 1986, this meant that those under 18 years of age could not be part of a religion and therefore the law required that they be excluded from religious activities. # * A religious society or group of believers may start its activities only after the registration of the society or group by the Committee on Religious Matters at the proper city or district (raion) Soviet. According to Edward Derwinski, the state used this right to de-register religious groupings, thus making it illegal for them to continue worship, and this was used to gradually reduce the number of registered religious buildings (i.e. churches, synagogues, mosques, etc.) across the country. # * In order to register a religious society at least 20 initiators must submit to the agencies mentioned in the previous Article an application in accordance with the form determined by the Permanent Committee for Religious Matters at the Council of Ministers. # In order to register a group of believers, the representative of the group (Art. 13) must submit an application to the agencies mentioned in Article 4 of the city or district where the group is located in accordance with the form determined by the Permanent Committee for Religious Matters at the Council of Ministers. # The registration agencies shall register the society or groups within one month, or inform the initiators of the denial of the registration. # The registration agencies shall be informed on the composition of the society, as well as on their executive and accounting bodies and on the clergy, within the period and in accordance with the forms determined by the Permanent Committee for Religious Matters at the Council of Ministers. # For the satisfaction of their religious needs, the believers who have formed a religious society may receive from the district or city Soviet, under a contract, free of charge, special prayer buildings and objects intended exclusively for the cult. Besides that the believers who have formed a religious society or group of believers may use for prayer meetings other premises left to them by private persons or local soviets on lease. Such premises shall be subject to all regulations provided for in the present law relating to prayer buildings; the contracts for the use of such premises shall be concluded by individual believers on their personal responsibility. Such premises shall be subject to technical and sanitary regulations. A religious society or group of believers may use only one prayer building or [complex of] premises. # Individual members of the executive organs of religious societies or representatives of groups of believers may make contractual agreements hiring persons to fulfil various jobs connected with guarding, repairing or procuring church property or material necessary for its preservation. [paraphrased] Such contracts may not include any commercial or industrial operations, even if related to the church, e.g. leasing of candle-producing plants or printing shops for the production of religious prayer books. # For each general assembly of a religious society or group of believers, permission shall be obtained: in cities from committees for religious matters of the city soviets, and in rural areas from the executive committees of the district. Article 17 banned churches from being used for activities beyond worship, thereby outlawing parish libraries, organized religious education, prayer meetings for women and young people, religious study groups and sewing circles. # * Teaching of any kind of the religious cult in schools, boarding schools, or preschool establishments maintained by the State, public institutions or private persons is prohibited. Such teaching may be given exclusively in religious courses created by the citizens of the USSR with the special permission of the Permanent Committee for Religious Matters at the Council of Ministers. # The clergy and other ministers of religion may operate only in the area of residence of members of the religious association by which they are employed and in the area of the temple where they serve. Clergymen regularly serving two or more religious associations may minister only in the areas of residence of the members of the given religious communities. According to Jennifer Wynot, priests were forbidden from living in cities. # * The religious societies and groups of believers may organize local, All-Russian or All-Union religious conventions or conferences by special permission issued separately for each case by: #:a) the Permanent Committee for Religious Matters of the Council of Ministers if an All-Russian or All-Union convention or congress on the territory of the RSFSR is supposed to be convoked. #:b) the local Committee for Religious Matters, if a local convention is supposed to be convoked. The permission for convocation of republican conventions and conferences shall be granted by the Committee for Religious Matters of the appropriate republic. # * All the property necessary for the performance of the religious rite, both that contractually leased to the believers forming the religious society, and that newly acquired or donated for the use in religious cult, is a nationalized property and is listed in the files of the local government organs. # * Prayer buildings and religious objects shall be leased to believers forming religious associations for use by the Committee for Religious Matters at the city or district soviet. # The temples and all the cult utensils within them are handed over for the use of believers forming the religious society, on conditions stated in the agreement concluded by the religious society with a representative of the local government. # The agreement must state that the persons taking over the building and its contents for religious use, pledge: #:a) to preserve and protect them as state property entrusted to them; #:b) to carry out all necessary repairs and to fulfill all financial obligations connected with the rental and use of the property e.g. for the heating, insurance, guarding, payment of taxes, special collections, etc.; #:c) to use all these properties only for the purpose of satisfying religious needs; #:d) to repay to the government the costs of any damaged or lost goods; #:e) to keep a register of all the belongings of the given temple, entering therein all additionally obtained (whether by purchase, personal donations, or receipt from other churches) objects of the religious rite... objects falling into disuse through wear and tear must be stricken out of the register informing the local government organ and receiving permission from the same to do so. #:f) official representatives of the local governments to be permitted by the parish executive to inspect the property and all its contents at all times except during the performance of the religious rite. # * All local residents belonging to the same faith may add their names to those who have already signed the lease agreement, thereby obtaining equal right with the former in administering over the properties... # Every signatory may remove his/her signature at a later date, departing from the religious community. This however does not free him/her from the responsibility for the state of the property and its contents up to the moment of his/her resignation. # Prayer buildings shall be subject to compulsory fire insurance for the benefit of the appropriate local government at the expense of the persons who signed the contract. In case of fire, the insurance payment may be used for the reconstruction of the prayer building destroyed by fire, or upon decision of the appropriate local government for special and cultural needs of a given locality in full accordance with the Decree of 24 August 1925 on the Utilization of Insurance Payments Acquired for Prayer Buildings Destroyed by Fire. # If there are not persons who wish to use a prayer building for the satisfaction of religious needs under the conditions provided for in Articles 27‚Äì33, the city or district soviet puts up a notice of this fact on the doors of the prayer building. # * The transfer of a prayer building leased for the use of believers for other purposes (liquidation of the prayer building) may take place only according to a decision of the Council of Ministers of the autonomous republic or oblast which must be supported by reasons, in a case where the building is needed for government or public purposes. The believers who formed the religious society shall be informed regarding such decision. # * Lease agreements regarding... houses used for religious rites can be annulled ahead of time by court action. # Only the pre-CRA authority may close a temple by the request of the Council of Ministers of an autonomous republic, a province or a city (in the cases of Moscow and Leningrad) government. # Should a temple be closed, its contents are distributed thus: #:a) all goods made of precious metals and containing precious or semi-precious stones go to the local government financial organs or the Ministry of Culture; #:b) all objects of historical and special artistic value for the Ministry of Culture; #:c) other objects (icons, clergy vestments, etc.) having special significance for the performance of the rite are given to believers for transfer to other, active, places of worship of the same faith...; #:d)... #:e) money, incense, candles, oil, wine, wax, firewood and coal remain with the religious society, should the latter remain in existence after the closure of the temple. # Prayer buildings and wayside shrines subject to liquidation, which are registered in special local agencies for State funds, may be transferred for use free of charge to proper Executive Committees or city soviets under the condition that they will be continuously considered as nationalized property and their use for other purposes than stipulated may not take place without the consent of the Minister of Finance. # * When the religious association does not observe the terms of the contract or orders of the Committee for Religious Matters (on registration, repair, etc.) the contract may be annulled. The contract may also be annulled upon the presentation of lower executive committees by the Council of Ministers of the autonomous republic, oblast, etc.. # When the decision of the authorities mentioned in Article 43 is appealed to the Council of Ministers within two weeks, the prayer buildings and property may actually be taken from the believers only after the final decisions of the council. # The construction of a new prayer building may take place upon request of religious societies under the observance of the general regulations pertaining to construction and technical rules as well as the special conditions stipulated by the Permanent Committee for Religious Matters at the Council of Ministers. # Should the temple, owing to its age, become a hazard to the believers using it, the executive committee of the local government has the right to propose to the parish executive organ to discontinue the building's use for religious purposes until an inspection by a technical commission. # * The technical inspection commission formed by the local government is to include a representative of the religious society in question. # The conclusion of the commission is final and its fulfilment is obligatory. # The commission's report is to state whether the building must be demolished or repaired. In the latter case the report is to detail the necessary repairs and the time needed for their conclusion. # In the case of the believers' refusal to carry out the required repairs, the agreement with the religious society on the lease of the property is nullified by the pre-CRA authority... # The pre-CRA authority also annuls the contract with the society if the commission concludes that the building must be wrecked. # * The members of the groups of believers and religious societies may pool money in the prayer building or premises and outside it by voluntary collections and donations, but only among the members of the given religious association and only for the purpose of covering the expenses for the maintenance of prayer building or premises and religious property, and for the salary of the clergy and activities of the religious bodies. # * Religious services take place in the temples without any express information to the effect of any local government organs. Local governments must be informed in advance, should a religious service take place in a building other than those officially assigned for such use. This meant that they had to get advanced permission. # * No religious rites may be performed in any state, public or co-operative institutions and enterprises. Neither may there be any religious symbols displayed in such buildings. This ban does not extend to special rites performed by request of a dying or gravely ill person, being in hospital or prison, if these rites are performed in special isolated rooms. Neither does the band extend to cemeteries and crematoria. # A special permission [granted] for each case separately by the Committee for Religious Matters is required for the performance of religious processions as well as the performance of religious rites in the open air. An application for such permission must be submitted at least two weeks prior to the ceremony. Such permission is not required for religious services connected with funerals. # No special permission is required for processions around the church as a part of the religious service, as long as they do not interfere with the traffic. # All other religious processions and all performances of religious rites outside the regular cult building require special permission of the local government in each particular case. # * The registration agencies of religious associations (Art. 6) submit data to the Committee for Religious Matters at the city and district soviets in accordance with the forms and within the period established by the Permanent Committee for Religious Matters at the Council of Ministers. Legislation passed in 1929 also forbade clergy or monastics from wearing religious garb in public. Islamic courts in Central Asia that interpreted Shariah were fully eliminated after this legislation in 1929.Froese, Paul (2005). \\"'I am an atheist and a Muslim': Islam, communism, and ideological competition\\".

USSR anti-religious campaign (1958‚Äì1964) = Supervision over the Fulfillment of Legislation on Religious Cults of the USSR = This legislation, drafted in 1961 during the height of a renewal persecution under Nikita Khrushchev, was designed to assist the anti-religious campaign especially with regard to the massive number of church closures that were conducted. It gave the state tight control over religious practices.Daniel, Wallace L. (2009). \\"Father Aleksandr men and the struggle to recover Russia's heritage.\\" Demokratizatsiya 17.1.

The Procedure is the same as in the LRA below, except that the registration is revoked by local government rather than by the CRA or its predecessors. # Prayer houses may be closed in the following cases: #:a) if the religious association using it has been deprived of registration; #:b) if the building has to be demolished owing to the reconstruction of the area or owing to the dilapidated state of the building as confirmed by a technical inspection document and co-ordinated with the local official of the CROCA/CRC. # No Orthodox, Old Believers, Armenian-Gregorian, Roman Catholic, Lutheran churches, Muslim mosques, Jewish synagogues, sectarian places of worship, Buddhist temples, actively in use by their religious societies may be closed without the express permission of the provincial government or Council of Ministers of an autonomous republic, co-ordinated with the central CROCA/CRC. # Registration and de-registration of clergy. The same as in LRA. # Provincial governments and their equivalents may order a limitation on tolling church bells, should this become necessary and be supported by the local population. V. Rules on the Use of Objects (Utensils) of the Cult Basically the same as in LRA. A lesser role is given to the CROCA/CRC; a greater to local governments. CROCA and CRC were amalgamated in 1965 to form the Council for Religious Affairs (CRA). CROCA and CRC were originally created by Joseph Stalin during the second world war (1939‚Äì1945) as liaison bodies between religion and the government. Under Nikita Khrushchev this function began to evolve into dictatorial bodies that exerted control over religious activities in the country. Articles 24‚Äì26 were ambiguous enough, that in practice they could be effectively used in order to close churches on a wide scale, as occurred under Khrushchev. The meagre protection that they offered (such as in article 26) were eliminated in 1975. Articles 6, 7, 10 and 11 could also be used. Choral singing, processions, church bells and other normal functions of churches could be interpreted as 'disturbing public order' and prohibited. Article 7a‚Äìc could be used by the state, which could apply it to any homily or sermon it didn't like. For example, Bishop Khrizostom of Kursk criticized 'scientific atheism' and claimed that science also needed faith as a motivation for its development, and as a result the bishop lost his position in the Department of External Ecclesiastical Relations and was moved to the Urals in 1984. Monks who preached about concentrating on the spiritual life and disregarding the temptations of the material world could be interpreted as 'propaganda aimed at tearing believers away from active participation in the state'. Fr Amvrossi was harassed and expelled twice in 1976 as a result of such homilies. Before this legislation had taken effect, believers who preached against atheism could be arrested for making 'political' sermons that were interpreted as an attack on state ideology. Article 10b in practice forbade priests from organizing pilgrimages, and from making claims of the miraculous. Priests were de-registered and even imprisoned for telling their parishioners about miracles. For example, Fr Sergi Zheludkov lost his registration in the 1960s for taking some of his parishioners to see supposed miraculous icon renewals (where an icon that is dark and covered with soot suddenly begin to shine again as though new). Article 11, made it such that it was not the Church that decided to have a church council or how many theological colleges were needed for its spiritual needs but rather it was the government that decided. Legislation in this year also gave the state control of financial activities of religious institutions and legally separated priests from control of parishes. A further law in 1962 gave the state control of all baptisms, marriages, burial services and other religious rites. = Provisions on the Council for Religious Affairs = In 1965 the Council for Religious Affairs (CRA) of the Council of Ministers was created from the amalgamation of CROCA and CRC. This organization inherited the role of dictatorial control over religious life in the country and it used whatever means it could in order to disrupt or put down religious activities. Its legal mandate was strengthened in the 1975 amendments to the LRA, although many of the powers that it would be officially given were things that it had already effectively been using (from its predecessors) since Nikita Khrushchev. # The CRA... has been formed for the implementation of the policies of the Soviet Government regarding religions. # The main functions of the CRA are: #:a) to make sure that the constitutional and all other legal provisions regarding Church-State relations are observed; #:b) to study and draw conclusions regarding the practice of the laws on religious cults, to draft new laws and decrees in this sphere...; #:c) to inform the Soviet Government on the activities of religious organizations; #:d) to help religious organizations in making international contacts, in participating in the struggle for peace and strengthening friendship between nations. # The CRA's duties include: #:a) assuring the realization of the constitutional right of Soviet citizens to profess a religion or not to profess any; #:b) supervision over the correct fulfillment of the laws on religion by religious organization and clergy; #:c) liaison functions between the religious organization and the Soviet Government on questions needing a governmental decision; #:d) keeping a register of all religious associations prayer houses and buildings; #:e) study and decision-making regarding questions arising out of activities of religious organizations in the USSR; #:f) checking the application of the laws on religion by central and local organizations; #:g) issuing resolutions on the union republican draft laws relating to religion; #:h) receipt of information and materials on religion from the central and local government organs. # The CRA has the right to: #:a) make decisions on the registration or de-registration of religious associations, on the opening and closing of temples and prayer houses; #:b) check the activities of religious organizations in regard to their observance of Soviet laws on religion; its orders to discontinue any abuses of the laws must be met without fail; #:c) raise the question of initiating penal administrative or criminal procedure against those in breach of the laws on religion #:d) clarify questions relating to the laws on religion to central and local government organs and other Soviet organizations; #:e) suggest to local and higher administrative organs abolition of instructions that contradict Soviet laws on religion. # Structure and staffing of the CRA # The CRA of the Soviet Council of Ministers at its meetings studies questions related to the practical application of the Soviet religious policies... makes decisions on the registration and de-registration of religious temples and prayer houses ... [and regarding all the other issues enumerated in article 1-5] # The CRA has its plenipotentiary officials in each union and autonomous republic and in every province, subordinate to the central CRA. # The local CRA official is responsible for all the actions on the local level, stipulated in the above articles. Has the same controlling powers over local church organizations and bishops as, in principle, the central CRA Office has over the whole Church. He also informs the CRA central office on all details of life and activities of local churches and clergy. # More details of the kind enumerated under No. 9 # (& 12). Additional details on the relationship between the local CRA and local governments, and on the CRA stamp. Adopted on 8 December 1965, confirmed on 10 May 1966Zakonodatel'stvo o religionzykh kul'takh (Moscow: Iuridicheskaia literatura, 1971 USSR anti-religious campaign (1970s‚Äì1990) =23 June 1975, Amendments to 1929 Laws on Religious Associations= The 1929 legislation on religious associations was amended in 1975. The most prominent difference was the status of the Council for Religious Affairs (created in 1965), which was given effective legal control and interference in the spiritual life of religious organizations. The amendments are listed below. # * A religious society or a group of believers may begin to function only after the Council for Religious Affairs... has made a decision regarding the registration of the society or group. The decision on the registration of a religious society or a group or believers and on the establishment of a prayer house is made by the council... on the recommendations of the Councils of Ministers if autonomous republics or the executive committees of regional, provincial or city (Moscow and Leningrad) soviets of workers' deputies. # In order to register a religious society its founders, consisting of at least twenty persons, address a petition to the executive committee of the district or city soviet... requesting the registration of the society and the opening of a prayer house... The Soviet addresses the received petition of the believers with its resolution to the Council of Ministers of the autonomous republic, [or] the executive committee of the regional, provincial, city (Moscow and Leningrad) soviet... # In order to effect the registration of the group, the petition signed by all the believers of the given group is submitted to the executive committee of the district or urban soviet... which forwards this petitions with its resolution attached to the Council of Ministers of an autonomous republic, to the executive committee of a regional, provincial or ([in the cases of] Moscow and Leningrad) city soviet... # The Council of Ministers of an autonomous republic, or the executive committee of a regional, provincial or city (Moscow and Leningrad [only]) soviet... having received the materials regarding the registration of a society or group of believers, is to complete their scrutiny within one month and then forward them with its representation to the Council for Religious Affairs of the USSR Council of Ministers for authorization. The Council for Religious Affairs... studies the materials... and makes the decision whether to register or to refuse to register the... group, and informs the latter on its decision. According to Yakunin and Regelson, there was no time limit for when it had to make a decision and this legal ambiguity was abused by the CRA. # * The Council for Religious Affairs keeps a register of all religious associations, houses of prayer and [other church] buildings... [and] establishes the order of submission of data on religious societies or groups of believers, their executive and auditing organs and the clergy. # * For the satisfaction of religious needs the believers making up a religious society may, on the decision of the Council for Religious Affairs... receive a special building for prayer, free of charge, on the conditions... stipulated in the agreement concluded between the religious society and a legitimate representative of the executive committee of the district or urban soviet. In additions, believers comprising a religious society or a group of believers may use for their communal prayer other structures on lease holding conditions placed at their disposal by individual persons or executive committees of district or urban soviets... These structures are subject to all the regulations of the legislation in force regarding house of prayer... Moreover, these structures must correspond to the regular building and sanitary safety regulations. A religious society or group of believers may used only one house of prayer. # * General meetings (other than prayer meetings) of religious societies and groups of believers may take place [only] on the permission of the executive committee of the district or urban soviet... # * No religious doctrines whatsoever may be taught in educational institutions. The teaching of religion is permitted in theological schools only, which may be established in accordance with the existing regulations. # * Religious societies and groups of believers may convoke religious congresses and conferences only with the express permission of the Council for Religious Affairs in each particular case. Religious centres, spiritual administrations and other religious organizations elected at such congresses and conferences have administrative jurisdiction only over the religious (canonical) activities of religious associations. They are supported by the contributions of religious associations collected exclusively by means of voluntary donations.

Article 142 could only be applied to believers who violated the law, while article 143 was for non-believers. This meant that in the unlikely scenario that a group of religious believers who sued a Soviet official, and an even less likely scenario of them winning the case, the guilty administrator would likely only have to face a public reprimand. No matter how many times such an official could be found guilty, the most he could be punished would be six months or correctional labour, while believers could face up to three years imprisonment. ;Article 190 The systematic distribution of false information, harmful to the Soviet government, or to the social order, whether in oral, written, or any other form ‚Äì is punishable by imprisonment for up to three years, or by correctional work for up to one year, or by a fine up to 100 roubles. This included homilies condemning religious persecutions. ;Article 199 ... the unlicensed construction of a dwelling or an addition ‚Äì is punishable by correctional work for a period of 6 months to one year with a confiscation of the construction or addition. This punished the expansion of a church without government authorization. ;Article 277 Organizations or the leadership of a group, which function under the guise of fulfilling religious duties, that are harmful, or that enlist other citizens into harmful activities by threat of expulsion from the religious group, or attempt to enlist or force others to enlist minors into the group ‚Äì is punishable by imprisonment for up to five years, or banishment for up to five years with or without confiscation of property... According to Pospielovsky, this was interpreted to prohibit any missionary work, and threatened with imprisonment any person who attracted converts or who strengthened religious convictions. This also allowed for the punishment of clergymen who tried to invoke spiritual discipline upon those under them who exhibited immoral or spiritually demoralizing behaviour. Other laws not mentioned included prohibitions of teaching religion to children under the age of 18, requirements to register all baptisms and religious rites with the state, as well as forbidding of priests to be on church councils.

As the name indicates, this body was concerned with oversight over the affairs of the common people, viewed as taxable producers of goods. The ministry maintained various records: the population census sent from the provinces, cadastral (real estate) records, and tax accounting records. =Ministerial authority under Y≈çr≈ç Code= The Y≈çr≈ç Code (a revised version of the Taih≈ç Code that created the ministry), stipulates the powers vested in the ministry, under its .

And the ministry was not \\"directly responsible for the upkeep of roads, bridgees, etc.,\\" but merely kept such records for taxation and tax transportation tracking purposes. = Popular Affairs certificate = The ministry issued order certificates or charters called the to officials and provincial governors (kokushi). The sh≈çen system recognized private ownership of reclaimed rice-paddy lands, but did not automatically confer tax-exemption (as some misleading dictionary definitions suggest). From the early Heian period, the tax-exempt or leniency status was ratified by the certificate or charter () issued either by this ministry or the Great Council (daij≈ç-kan) itself. (See ).The Ministry of Popular Affairs (which dealt with the common people and not the gentry) did not have the decision-power to issue such charter on its own initiative. It merely drafted and rubberstamped the charter at the behest of the Great Council. In the period (859‚Äì877) occurred a breakdown of the Ritsury≈ç system under the Fujiwara no Yoshifusa regime, with authorities of the ministries absorbed by the Great Council. The decree of J≈çgan 4, VII, 27 (August 826)in volume 6 of essentially stripped the ministry of its control over the tax-leniency policy, ordaining that all applications for tax relief would be decided completely by the Great Council of State (daij≈ç-kan), and its ruling delivered directly to the countries by the Great Council's certificate (daij≈ç-kan fu). The ministry still issued certificates for exemptions on the sh≈çen estates, but this was just rubberstamping decisions from above, as before. These changes in the exercise of administration were codified in the and later Engishiki.There is a shift in terminology.

They remained a performing band for almost a decade, and released two singles and a couple of albums between 1978 and 1981. Most of their work was done outside of the UK, largely in Continental Europe. History The band was formed in Norwich, England in 1975. The guitarist and singer, Martin Allen and bass guitarist John C. Barry had met while studying for A levels at Norwich City College. The drummer and singer Jack Hazebroek, originally from the Netherlands but then living and working in Norwich, joined the duo from an advertisement in the Norwich Evening News. The Sunny Jim Band were originally playing heavy 1970s funk a cross between The Meters, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Grand Funk Railroad. A self-financed single \\"Memories\\" / \\"Pretty Little Girl\\" was recorded at Nest Studios in Birmingham. Copies made their way to the Netherlands and resulted in the band leaving England for a Dutch tour in 1976. The band soon based themselves in Amsterdam living at the H88 (Herengracht 88) bar and hotel. Didier Laget (discovered during the band's visit to Tours, France) joined to fill the missing lead guitar role in 1977. During 1976 and 1977, the band played regularly at Paradiso and Melkweg (\\"The Milky Way\\") Amsterdam, supporting Tom Robinson, and The Pixies. The Sunny Jim Band signed to the American impresario, Russ Carney's Tumasi Productions. Groningen situated in the north of the Netherlands was a regular haunt for the band live during 1977, where they were approached by Herman Brood (who was often at their live shows), and who was also looking for a backing band at the time. The band's first single \\"Thanks For The Music\\" / \\"Pretty Little Girl\\", was produced by Piet Souer and released by Phillips Holland in 1978. Jack Hazebroek left the band in 1978, and was replaced by drummer Jaap Vreenegoor. Sunny Jim Band started touring in West Germany and built up a reputation on the West-German live circuit. The band were becoming influenced by the wave of punk bands coming out of England. They were particularly influenced by The Police, Elvis Costello and by Herman Brood. In 1979, Sierk Janszen replaced Jaap Vrenegoor on drums, joining in time to tour Hungary with the popular Hungarian band P.Mobil. They were the first Western band to play in Hungary since the Spencer Davis Group toured in the 1960s. Frank Henneke, the drummer of the Dutch band Turf, replaced Sierk Janszen who remained as part of the road crew. Discovered in Hamburg at The Logo club by Ulf Kr√ºger, the band were signed to Phonogram Germany in 1980, and recorded their first album, Maximum Pain, with Ulf Kruger as producer and Geoffrey Peacey as co-producer. The album was produced live in the studio in ten days in an effort to capture their live power. Frank Henneke was replaced on drums by a return to the band of Jaap Vrenegoor. The single, \\"Mixed-Up\\" / \\"I Tried\\" was recorded in Germany, and released on the Vertigo label with Robert Jan Stipps producing. The band were looking for a more polished sound for their records, after being disappointed by the lack of positive reviews for Maximum Pain, and finally this led to Steve Nye being approached to produce their second LP, Jay. German tours continued supporting Whitesnake, Joe Cocker and Stray Cats, and the band were recorded live in WDR Cologne TV studios and broadcast on the German television show Rockpalast. The band returned to the UK to record their second album Jay in January, February and March 1981. This album was produced by Steve Nye at Air Studios in London, the recording engineers being Colin Fairley, and Steve Churchyard. Side two of the album opened with a reggae/glam rock fusion cover version of Bob Dylan's \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\". Sunny Jim Band supported The Boomtown Rats on a German tour in 1982, and the band continued in various versions including Lutz Oldemeier on drums until 1985. John C. Barry and Martin Allen continued writing songs in the early 1980s, and briefly worked with Bruce Woolley. They were signed by EMI Cologne as The Graduates. Jack Hazebroek joined The Graduates sessions under guidance of Wolf Maahn. Icebox, Technological Revolution and The Good Things were recorded on the then new Mitsubishi digital tape system in Cologne. John C. Barry left to pursue a career as an artist, lyricist and bassist in Berlin in 1986.

Annenberg serves as President and Chairwoman of the Board of The Annenberg Foundation, a multibillion-dollar philanthropic organization in the United States. Early life and education Wallis Annenberg was born in 1939 in Philadelphia, into a Jewish family, the daughter of publishing magnate Walter Hubert Annenberg, and his first wife, Bernice Veronica Dunkelman (known as Ronny), a socialite from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Her grandfather Moses Annenberg (1877‚Äì1942), owner of The Philadelphia Inquirer, emigrated from Germany to Chicago in 1900. Her father owned a estate called Inwood, where Wallis was raised. When she was ten years old, her parents divorced and her mother moved to Washington, D.C. to marry Ben Ourisman, a Chevrolet car dealer. Meanwhile, her father remarried in the year after the divorce to Leonore \\"Lee\\" Cohn, the niece of Columbia Pictures President Harry Cohn. She graduated from Pine Manor College in 1959 when it was a junior college. She had a brother, Roger, who committed suicide at a psychiatric institution in Bucks County, Pennsylvania at age 22 in 1962 while on leave from Harvard University for treatment of schizophrenia. She named one of her sons after her brother. Marriage and divorce On a trip to Venice in 1959, to celebrate completion of junior college, Annenberg met Seth Weingarten, who had just completed his undergraduate education at Princeton University and was looking forward to Yale Medical School. They quickly fell in love and, after only one year of studies at Columbia, Annenberg dropped out of school and married Weingarten at Inwood in 1960. They moved around the country, following her husband's career, and having four children in the process: Lauren (born in New Haven, Connecticut in 1961), Roger (who was named after Wallis's deceased brother), Gregory (born in New York City during Weingarten's residency at New York Hospital), and Charles (born in Roswell, New Mexico where Weingarten was serving as a medical officer at Walker Air Force Base). At her insistence, Weingarten accepted a position at UCLA (at the hospital now known as Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center) and they established a permanent home in California. In 1975, she divorced Dr. Weingarten and in 1978 he won the custody of the children. One year later he offered Wallis full custody.  Career  Then Wallis started to work for Triangle Publications, which included TV Guide and Seventeen magazine, as well as radio and TV stations nationwide. At this time her father was its Chairman of the Board. She stayed for three years after its sale to Rupert Murdoch in 1988. She appeared on The Joan Rivers Show on the new Fox television network in 1986, alongside actresses Lucille Ball & Michele Lee. Philanthropy After she passed away in March 2009, Leonore Anneberg left the leadership of the Annenberg Foundation to Wallis and three of her children: Lauren, Gregory and Charles. Wallis Annenberg today carries on her father's legacy as a public benefactor. As Chairman and President of the Annenberg Foundation, she donates the family name and fortune to philanthropic and charitable projects, largely to the benefit of Los Angeles County. She is on the board of trustees at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art as well as at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. She is also a supporter of the Harlem Children's Zone, the Ojai Foundation's \\"Council project\\" for inner-city kids, and the Ocean Alliance. She serves on the Board of Trustees at the University of Southern California (home of the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism); the Wallis Annenberg Hall at USC was opened at part of the Annenberg School in 2014. In 2017 she was honored with the USC University Medallion for her philanthropy and leadership. She is involved with the Wallis Annenberg Concourse at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center as well as the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts, which held its opening gala in October 2013. She was inspired by and provided funding to build the Universally-Accessible Treehouse in Torrance, California. \\"It is thrilling to be able to make it possible for people of all ages and physical abilities to experience the world from a treehouse,\\" said Wallis Annenberg. \\"There's a sense of vision, fun and pure escape that only such a structure can provide.\\" Annenberg serves on the Board of Directors for the New York-based chapter of the foundation of Princess Charlene of Monaco. Her children Lauren Bon, Gregory Weingarten and Charles Weingarten serve on the board of directors of the Annenberg Foundation. Her son Roger Weingarten, a resident of Devereux in Santa Barbara, California who was diagnosed schizophrenic at age 15 like his namesake, is not on the board. Despite her father leaving the majority of his multibillion-dollar fortune to the Annenberg Foundation, it is estimated that Annenberg has a personal fortune in excess of five hundred million dollars.

It is located in the state of Lower Austria and was formerly known as Fucking before it changed its name.  History of name Fugging was first referred to as Fucking in 1195 in a local monastery's parish records. Its name was later changed from Fucking to Fugging for an unknown reason by 1836. While it is not known why the village changed its name, it has been speculated by its current mayor that because Fugging is closer to Vienna than the other village of Fucking is, it would have likely had more English- speaking visitors who might have raised questions regarding its name, which is also an English vulgar slang word for sexual intercourse. The village's placename signs are firmly mounted to prevent street sign theft. In 2012, there were reports that the village of Fucking in Upper Austria attempted to change its name to Fugging through a referendum after receiving large amounts of prank phone calls from English speakers about the village's name. According to these reports, they were unable to do so because Fugging in Lower Austria was already so named; Fugging mayor Andreas Dockner said that \\"We think one Fugging in Austria is enough\\". However, Franz Meindl, the mayor of Fucking, rejected the claim that his town was planning on changing its name: \\"This was discussed a few years ago but nothing came of it. It is certainly not under discussion now.\\" Both villages' names are derived from Focko, a Bavarian noble from the sixth century.  Facilities  Fugging has a village church that was built in 1894 and consecrated in 1896. It was later renovated in 1984 after the roof required repair work after damage from persistent hailstorms.

There is also a Canadian Plush Lop breed in development. Similar in appearance, the Velveteen Lop breed is also in development. Miniature Plush Lops were the first to be developed. Devie D'anniballe began creating this breed in 1995 in the United States. She succeeded in developing them by combining the previously existing breeds of Holland Lop, Mini Rex, and Mini Lop. Her aim was to create the perfect pet by retaining the good qualities of these breeds, while \\"breeding out\\" all the problems existing in these breeds. Origins By selecting for the best traits of each of these breeds, Devie created a breed of rabbit that had the compact, appealing body and lop ears of the Holland Lop and Mini Lop, combined with the soft, short, hypoallergenic fur of the Mini Rex. Since her aim was to create the perfect pet, personality was of great importance in Devie's breeding program. Miniature Plush Lops today have playful, friendly personalities, but they are also docile enough to allow their owners to hold them for reasonably long periods of time. While they are adventurous and outgoing, they are easy to catch, and quite affectionate. Development Standard Plush Lops were developed in Australia by Christine Toyer, starting in the early 1990s. Christine developed the Plush Lop by crossing Dwarf Lops with Standard Rex. This breed is best described by Christine Toyer herself, who said, \\"Combining the velvety short coats of the Rex Rabbit breed, with the loving personality and cute looks of the Lop Rabbit breeds, the Plush Lop is a breed with a lot to recommend it, both for pet owners and for the serious breeder.\\" In Australia and the UK, Plush Lops are still considered a breed in development, although it seems that soon Plush Lops will become a fully standardised breed according to the British Rabbit Council. Plush Lops may never become a standardised breed with the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA), because one of ARBA's rules states that a new type of rabbit cannot be recognized as a \\"breed\\" if it only differs from an existing breed in coat quality. So if a Mini Plush Lop is nearly the same as a Holland Lop, excepting the rex coat, it is not \\"different\\" enough to be accepted by ARBA rules. Canadian Plush Lop There is also a Canadian Plush Lop, with the \\"curly\\" variant rex fur. Created using Astrex as well as Holland Lop and Mini Rex base stock, the Canadian Plush Lop is a curly breed. It has a more fully arched conformation than the other rex lops, is very bold and friendly, and excels at rabbit agility. The breed does not carry the dwarf gene and so tends to be four to six pounds in adult weight. Canadian Plush Lops were developed mainly in Alberta since the mid-1990s. The work was initiated by Dr. Helga Vierich and Brenda Wheeler, two Edmonton area breeders, and a Breeder's Group, formed in 2004, consisting of six rabbitries, carries on the work today. The Canadian Plush Lop (or CPLop as it is sometimes called) shares with the rare Astrex rabbit the tendency for the kits to be curly until the first juvenile moult, followed by a less curly \\"eclipse\\" coat. Then, at eight to eighteen months, the curls return with the first full adult moult. Canadian Plush Lops are the only fully arched lop breed and are one of only three curly-rex breeds in existence, but people who have come to know this breed tend to find their extremely people-oriented temperament their most remarkable feature. =Working Standard= Working Standard for the Canadian Plush Lop [source: document approved by the Breeders' Group in 2008, updated 2011] The Canadian Plush Lop Working Standard SCHEDULE OF POINTS *General type: 45 Head and ears: 10 Chest and shoulders: 5 Midsection 5 Hindquarters 10 Bone, legs, and feet 10 Tail 5 *Fur: 40 Texture 15 Luster 5 Amount of curl 20 *Color and Markings: 10 *Condition: 5 Total Points: 100 To be entered and shown in two classifications: Broken Pattern and Solid Pattern Solid Pattern is either Self or Shaded. SHOWROOM CLASSES AND WEIGHTS *Senior Bucks ‚Äì 6 months of age and over, weight 3 ¬Ω to 6 pounds. Ideal 4 1/2 *Senior Does ‚Äì 6 months of age and over, weight 3 ¬Ω to 6 ¬Ω pounds. Ideal 5 *Junior Bucks and Does ‚Äì Under 6 months of age, minimum weight 2 1/2 pounds. Note: No animal may be shown in a higher or lower age classification than its true age. Juniors must be lopped, but do not have to show curl in the coat although preference will be given to a curly coated animal. Canadian Plush Lops should be judged without handling, except for preliminary examination and coat evaluation. General type is best viewed by stepping back from the judging table and allowing the rabbit to pose and move naturally. A Canadian Plush Lop should not be pushed down or flattened out while judging. The animal should be friendly and bold in attitude, not shy or aggressive. They should have the look of an athletic, active individual. GENERAL TYPE Body ‚Äì This is a full-arched breed, but not one taken to extremes. The body is to be of medium length, with width gradually increasing from the shoulders to the rump. Preference is given to an animal that will naturally sit upright on its haunches. In this position, there should be an arch and the body should be held off the ground. Ideally this animal should be handled little and allowed to run on the table to assess correctness of the bounding motion. Faults ‚Äì extreme shortness of back so there is no arch; no increase in width from front to back. Hindquarters ‚Äì well muscled, rounded, and giving the appearance of springiness. Tail carried tightly to the rump. The hindquarters should be large and well muscled, and the body of the animal should be held well off the ground. Faults ‚Äì screw tail, undercut, pinched hindquarters. Midsection ‚Äì should be broad enough to create taper from the hips to the shoulders. Faults ‚Äì Rolls of fat. Cut severely for midsection wider than hindquarters. Chest and Shoulders ‚Äì Chest not too broad, forelimbs should emerge very straight and not be too far apart when the animal is sitting. Shoulders should be smooth and trim, but muscular enough to balance with the width of the midsection. Faults ‚Äì overly wide, flabby, or too fat or fleshy shoulder. Pigeon chest. Head and Ears ‚Äì the whole appearance of the head and face of the animal should exemplify interest and alertness, as well as beauty and refinement. The skull should be wedge-shaped, no less than between the ears, with a well-shaped crown. The crown should be situated on the very back of the top of the skull. This is further back than in most other lopped breeds. The ear should be about a finger width or more behind the position of the eye. Eyes large and preferably dark in all varieties but may be blue-gray in dilute Sable Points. Muzzle relatively small. The profile should be straight or even dished. Ears heavy, fleshy, somewhat tubular near the crown, well furred, extending at least below the jaw line when vertical--long enough to meet in front of the nose, but not more than beyond that. The tips should be gently rounded. The ear should be as wide as possible ( minimum at the widest part). There is no dewlap and the whole appearance of the head should be clean and free from fat and excess flesh. The head of the mature buck should be relatively wide and masculine, while the head of the doe is more refined and feminine, setting off the large eyes. In each sex the size of the head should be in balance with the rest of the animal and there should be no flattening of the face. Ears may show some mobility. Faults ‚Äì overly large muzzle; eyes too small to balance the rest of the face; large dewlap; overly flat, round face (too short foreface, Holland Lop appearance). Feet, Legs, Bone ‚Äì the hind feet should appear wide and large, with good fur covering and strong nails and well defined ligaments. The forelimbs should be relatively long and slender and quite straight seen from the front. The foot should appear ‚Äúon its toes‚Äù when the animal moves, but there should be a soft angulation at the wrist joint seen from the side, so that the animal does not jar its back when running. Bone should not appear heavy but rather strong and finely made. Faults ‚Äì bowlegs in forelimbs; big or wide forefeet; forelimbs too short for the animal to sit up well; crooked or twisted legs; hind feet too narrow, too short to support the powerful hindquarters, or not parallel. Weak or twisted toenails. Fur ‚Äì soft and lustrous coat with as much wave and curl as possible, especially around the head and neck. Length of coat up to . Guard hairs should not be very noticeable except in junior and intermediate animals. Adult coat should be as thick and plush as possible without compromising the silky texture. You should be able to feel the curl, not just see it. The ideal coat should glow like a jewel. Appearance resembling satin preferred and satinized animals not to be faulted. Whiskers should be shortened, twisted and curled. This is a curly haired breed, and the genetic factors responsible seem to increase their influence with each adult molt. Junior animals may exhibit a cottony soft or in some cases even a harsher texture, straighter, and occasionally with prominent guard hair, which all but disappears in the first adult molt around one year of age. Faults ‚Äì in adults, guard hair prominent, protruding from coat to the extent that it interferes with the soft lustrous feel. Fur coarse and unyielding to touch. Complete absence of waves or curls, especially around head and neck. COLORS SOLID CLASS *Self Group: Black ‚Äì The surface color is to be rich, jet black, extending well down the hair shaft.

The album has eleven songs in total, including two English language songs. Furthermore, five songs were recorded and produced at Lionheart Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The album went gold within four days of its release, and was later certified platinum. Production Kostas Martakis collaborated with Swedish duo Holter/Erixson on five songs for the album, which were recorded and produced at Lionheart studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Besides the title track and single \\"Pio Konta\\", Holter/Erixson also wrote an English-language version of that song titled \\"Dance on Me (Dam-Dam)\\" included as a bonus track, as well as composing three other dance songs on the album. \\"Diskola Na S'agapo\\" is produced by Holter/Erixson and Bobby Ljunggren, with music composition by Vasilis Vlahakis. Kostas Martakis also collaborated with duo Symphonic on the English language duet with Bulgarian singer Desi Slava titled \\"Agapi Mou (Loving U)\\". Additional songwriters include Hristodoulos Siganos and Valentino with \\"Glyko Koritsi\\" and Giorgos Papadopoulos with \\"Giati\\", while singer‚Äìsongwriters have also contributed, including Greek rock musician Kostas Tournas with \\"Proti Mou Fora\\" and Grigoris Petrakos with \\"Kathe Proi\\". Release The release of Pio Konta marks Kostas Martakis' second studio album. Released on 12 November 2009 in Greece and Cyprus, it is Martakis' first album under his signing with Universal Music Greece. Beginning in 2009, Universal Music Greece's promotional campaign introduced new album packaging under a fixed price sold through unconventional distribution channels. As a result, the album was released in digipak packaging priced at 9.90 euro, notable for being about half of the average price of a CD album in the Greek market. The physical release was available for purchase at newsstand kiosks, as well as at traditional points of sale. Additionally for its first week of release, it was included as a bonus CD when purchasing the magazine Tiletheatis. The album was once again circulated via print media the following year in May 2010, this time being bundled with newspaper Espresso News. Critical reception Popular Cypriot music website music.net.cy proclaimed that Kostas Martakis is raising the bar for Greek pop music, as all eleven tracks have a unique sound under current Greek music standards lending to the fact that some of the tracks were produced in Sweden. They concluded that Martakis is ready to conquer the Greek pop music scene, while calling the album one of the best Greek pop albums of recent years. Promotion Leading up to the album's release, Martakis appeared on a number of television shows including \\"Mes Tin Kali Hara\\" (with Natalia Germanou) and \\"Kafes me tin Eleni\\" (with Eleni Menegaki) on Alpha Channel, as well as a sit down interview with Tatiana Stefanidou on \\"Axizi Na To Deis\\" on ANT1, where he also performed some songs off the album. Martakis also appeared on Dromos FM on 12 November 2009 where the station played his new songs over the course of the interview. For the winter 2009-2010 season, Martakis appeared weekly at club Theatro alongside Nikos Kourkoulis and Aggeliki Iliadi in support of Pio Konta. Track listing Singles \\"Pio Konta\\" :The lead single is the title-track \\"Pio Konta\\" and it was released as a digital download on 30 July 2009. The electronic dance single became a radio hit, topping several radio station charts. The single also marks Martakis' first collaboration with Swedish producer duo Holter/Erixson. A music video was released shortly after on 5 August 2009, premiering on Universal Music Greece's official Youtube channel. Directed by Dimitris Silvestrou, the video showcases Martakis in front of a giant video wall along with various dancers, singing to a woman standing across him. An English-language version of the song titled \\"Dance On Me (Dam- Dam)\\" is also included on the album. \\"Gliko Koritsi\\" :The second single, \\"Gliko Koritsi\\", was released as a digital download on 5 November 2009. Martakis had also performed this single at his appearance on \\"Mes Tin Kali Hara\\" in October. The single did not gain substantial airplay and was generally not presented during Martakis' promotions for the album. The song's folk style is also substantially different from the other songs on the album. \\"Pote\\" :The third single and second music video, \\"Pote\\". \\"Agapi Mou (Loving You)\\" :The fourth single, \\"Agapi Mou, features a music video shot alongside Desi Slava in Bulgaria.

It is spoken in a dozen or so villages in Dongxiang Autonomous County, Gansu Province, China. The linguist Mei W. Lee-Smith calls this creole language the \\"Tangwang language\\" (), based on the names of the two largest villages (Tangjia ÂîêÂÆ∂ and Wangjia Ê±™ÂÆ∂, parts of Tangwang town) where it is spoken. Speakers According to Lee- Smith (1996), the Tangwang language is spoken by about 20,000 people living in the north-eastern part of the Dongxiang Autonomous County (Tangwang town). These people self-identify as Dongxiang (Santa) or Hui people. The Tangwang speakers don't speak Dongxiang language. Description The Tangwang language uses mostly Mandarin words and morphemes with Dongxiang grammar. Besides Dongxiang loanwords, Tangwang also has a substantial number of Arabic and Persian loanwords. Like standard Mandarin, Tangwang is a tonal language. However, grammatical particles, which are typically borrowed from Mandarin but used in the way Dongxiang morphemes would be used in Dongxiang, do not carry tones. For example, while the Mandarin plural suffix -men () has only very restricted usage (it can be used with personal pronouns and some nouns related to people), Tangwang uses it, in the form -m, universally, the way Dongxiang would use its plural suffix -la. Mandarin pronoun ni () can be used in Tangwang as a possessive suffix (meaning \\"your\\"). Unlike Mandarin, but like Dongxiang, Tangwang has grammatical cases as well (but only four of them, instead of eight in Dongxiang). The word order of Tangwang is the same as Dongxiang subject-object-verb form. Tangwang combines the characteristics of Mandarin Chinese and Dongxiang Mongolian. The hybrid language is a symbol of language blending. According to Lee-Smith, the blending is caused by the Silk Road. See also *Wutun language References Further reading Xu, Dan [Âæê‰∏π]. 2014.

The homes within the district date from 1948-49 and are associated with the Cold War expansion of plutonium manufacturing at the plant.  History  From its inception in 1943, when it displaced the existing village at the site, wartime Richland grew to a population of 25,000 by 1945. It was built up rapidly in stages under a master plan that covered residential areas, commercial centers and government facilities along with all related infrastructure. Housing was built in tracts and clustered by demographic (apartments for singles, houses for families, etc.) and, to some extent, income. All land and buildings were owned by the government. Residents paid a nominal rent and were assigned their units through waiting lists. Because homes were allocated based on family size and need, there were a number of floor plans available. These were each identified by a letter of the alphabet, and so came to be known as \\"alphabet\\" houses. With the advent of the Cold War, plutonium production at the Hanford plant was ramped up, resulting in a need for increased staffing of the technical and administrative ranks. This in turn created a need for new housing in Richland. Accordingly, new neighborhoods were created in 1948‚Äì49. The historic district comprises one of these neighborhoods. Because the housing was intended for upper-income families and was near the Columbia River, it came to be known as the \\"Gold Coast.\\" The moniker was in use for the area as early as 1952. The motivation for seeking a place in the National Register arose from an inventory of 5000 of the alphabet houses prepared in the early 2000s by local residents interested in documenting the unique aspects of Richland's built environment. In 2004, the Governor's Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (GACHP) began reviewing the City's Gold Coast Historic District preservation application. The district, comprising 118 contributing and 45 noncontributing properties was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. and  See also  *National Register of Historic Places listings in Benton County, Washington References  External links  *Guide to alphabet houses in Richland *Benton County Historical Society guide to letter houses in Richland Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Washington (state) National Register of Historic Places in Benton County, Washington Richland, Washington ","title":"Gold Coast Historic District (Richland, Washington)"},{"id":"25063537","text":"The Klamath River is a river in southern Oregon and northern California in the United States. This article describes its course. Oregon Mount Shasta rises above the Klamath River's watershed. The Klamath River's drainage basin above Upper Klamath Lake is fed primarily by the Williamson River and the Sprague River, which stretch into south-central Oregon east of the Cascades. The official beginning of the long river is at the outlet of Upper Klamath Lake, a large and artificially expanded lake east of the Cascade Range. Above Upper Klamath Lake, several streams drain south and southeast from the Cascades to form Agency Lake, which is connected to Upper Klamath Lake. After flowing out of the Bureau of Reclamation-built dam, the river flows into a stretch known as the Link River, past the city of Klamath Falls and into Lake Ewauna, a -long reservoir. The Lost River enters from the left via a series of agricultural ditches and canals (formerly, all of its water emptied into Tule Lake). It crosses under Oregon State Route 97 twice, once upstream of and once downstream of Oregon Route 140, and continues west through an agricultural valley to Keno. At Keno the river veers sharply south and passes through the Keno Dam, which forms Lake Ewauna, from the mouth, passing the now-drained Lower Klamath Lake.BEST and WSTB, p.27 The Klamath enters a narrow gorge and runs northeast, then enters the J.C. Boyle Reservoir, formed by the John C. Boyle Dam, and passes through the gates of the dam from the mouth. After flowing out of the rockfill structure, the river heads south and plunges rapidly into a narrow and deep gorge about deep and wide. After flowing a few miles through this narrow gorge, it widens into a rugged valley and turns west-southwest, crossing the Oregon-California border. Butte Creek comes in from the south. After crossing the border, the river turns sharply south, diverges around a small island, and receives Edge Creek from the right. The river then flows into Copco Lake, formed by the Copco Dam. Exiting the dam from the mouth, the river bends sharply north then south around a ridge and receives Fall Creek from the right as it passes the town of Copco. There are proposals to remove all four dams by 2020. Far northern California The river then enters Iron Gate Reservoir, from the mouth. The river receives Jenny Creek, a much larger tributary, which is formed by streams draining out of Howard Prairie Lake nearly to the north. The reservoir bends south and the Klamath flows away through Iron Gate Dam, from the mouth. The river then swings west and passes through an arid valley used for farming and ranching. Near Hornbrook the river receives Hutton Creek from the right and turns sharply south as it meets Interstate 5.The river then veers west again as it receives the Shasta River, which flows north from the Mount Shasta area, from the left. California State Route 96 drops into the canyon and begins to parallel the river, some from the mouth. Lower Klamath Lake seen today under heavy fog Flowing through its narrow canyon, the river receives Beaver Creek from the right, from the mouth, as it passes the small hamlet of Klamath River from the south. It then turns west, and with the massive bulk of Dry Lake Mountain looming to the north, the river receives Horse Creek from the right after passing the town of the same name. It then turns south and then west, whipsawing through an increasingly narrow gorge, and receives the Scott River from the left and passes Hamburg, from the mouth. The river then passes Seiad Valley and receives Seiad Creek from the right and Grider Creek from the left, from the mouth. The river then enters another narrower gorge and passes Fort Goff before dropping over a series of rapids. The river rounds a bend southward, then twists sharply northward, southwest and southeast around a ridge as it receives China Creek from the left, from the mouth. The river then again bends southwest, then curves northward, diverges around two islands, then swings east and finally southwest around another ridge as it enters a wider valley and passes the town of Happy Camp, from the mouth. Receiving wide, shallow Indian Creek from the right, the Klamath then bends southwest into a narrow gorge, still paralleling State Route 96. The river passes Clear Creek from the mouth and receives the creek of the same name as it begins to flow south-southeast; a little farther on, it receives Independence Creek from the left, then bends west as it receives King Creek from the left. Now incised into a narrow channel and meandering around sandbars and gravel bars, the river drops over rapid after rapid and turns south as it receives Dillon Creek from the right, from the mouth. Ti Creek enters from the left and Rock Creek from the right as the river continues to flow south through a steep and narrow gorge, cutting through the Cascade Range itself. The valley of the Klamath gradually transitions from an arid high desert to a temperate rainforest climate. [NOTE: THE MILEAGES FROM HERE ON ARE ALL MUCH TOO LOW; FOR EXAMPLE, BLUFF CREEK IS ABOUT 52 MILES FROM THE MOUTH.] It drops over Ishi Pishi Falls, a historical Native American fishing spot, and receives the Salmon River, its most powerful tributary thus far, from the left, from the mouth. Here it rounds a small ridge, then turns southwest and passes the town of Orleans, from the mouth. The river then bends north, west and south around another ridge, receives Boise Creek from the left and Slate Creek and Bluff Creek from the right, from the mouth. Weitchpec to mouth The Klamath rounds a northerly bend around Burrill Peak, passing Weitchpec as it turns northwestward on the beginning of its final run to the sea. At Weitchpec, the river receives its largest and most important tributary, the Trinity River, from the south (left), from the mouth. A vital contributor to the flow of the lower Klamath, the Trinity drains in the Cascade Range south of the Klamath and Salmon rivers. More than 90 percent of its flow is diverted at Trinity Lake - leaving the most important tributaries below the dam, the North Fork, South Fork, and the New River to replenish it. At Weitchpec, State Route 96 turns away from the Klamath and runs south up the Trinity, and its role along the Klamath is replaced by California State Route 169. After collecting the Trinity, the Klamath turns north-northwest and receives Pine Creek and Tully Creek from the left. The Klamath approaching its mouth, near the Turwar Creek confluence Twisting westwards, then again north, the Klamath passes the town of Johnsons, from the mouth. State Route 169 terminates at Johnsons, and for the remainder of its course, the Klamath flows through a wild canyon nearly untouched by human intervention. It diverges around a large sandy island, and receives Ah Pah Creek from the left and Blue Creek from the right, from the mouth. This area was originally intended to be the site of a massive storage dam, Ah Pah Dam. The river flows north through an increasingly wide valley, then passes the town of Klamath Glen, where State Route 169 resumes. The river meanders north and then veers west, crossing under U.S. Highway 101 and passing the towns of Klamath and Requa. All three towns are on the right bank of the river. Less than a mile downstream of this point, the Klamath empties into the sea, south of Point St. George and north of Trinidad Head.UCGS, p. 303 Much of the middle course of the river in California is within the Klamath National Forest. The lower course of the river, in northern Humboldt County and southern Del Norte County, passes through the homeland of the Karuk Tribe and the Yurok Indian Reservation. An stretch of the river in Oregon south of Klamath Falls to the California-Oregon border, including the Hell's Corner Gorge, has been designated as the Klamath Wild and Scenic River.Palmer, p. 141 See also * Klamath River * Klamath Project, the set of United States Bureau of Reclamation dams on upstream tributaries of the Klamath, primarily for agricultural water storage * Klamath River Hydroelectric Project, the set of privately owned dams on the mainstem of the Klamath, some of which are targeted for removal * River of Renewal: Myth and History in the Klamath Basin (book) References Works cited *Palmer, Tim (1993).

From at least the 13th century the city of Amid had been part of the Diocese of Maiperqat of the Church of the East; following the schism of 1552 it became the seat of its own diocese in the Chaldean Church. The archdiocese lapsed in 1929 on the death of the bishop Shlemun Mushe al-Sabbagh. The title of Amid was revived by the Chaldean church in 1966 as the Chaldean Catholic Archeparchy of Amida. The Archeparchy is now the sole remaining Chaldean diocese in Turkey, so in effect has jurisdiction over all of Turkeys Chaldeans. They maintain 2 churches in Diyarbakir and the bishop resides in Istanbul. Background The East Syriac Diocese of Amid was a comparatively late foundation. The city of Amid (Diyarbakir) was predominantly an Armenian and Syriac Orthodox centre; there is little evidence for a presence of the Church of the East in the earlier period. Amid was part of the Church of the East Diocese of Maiperqat in 1257, when the bishop Yohannan 'of Maiperqat and Amid' was present at the consecration of the patriarch Makkikha II.Sliba, 120 (Arabic) Some years later the bishop Ishodnah of 'Maiperqat, Amid and Mardin' was present at the consecrations of the patriarchs Denha I in 1265 and Yahballaha III in 1281.Sliba, 121‚Äì2 and 124 (Arabic) The diocese of Maiperqat is attested as early as 1018, and given the prominence of Maiperqat in the titles of these two bishops, Amid and Mardin were probably administered by the East Syriac bishops of Maiperqat in the thirteenth century. A manuscript in the Berlin collection lists seven purported fourteenth- and fifteenth-century bishops of Amid: Marutha, Sliba- zkha, Gabriel, Shemon, Nathaniel, Israel and Shubhalmaran.MS Berlin Syr 14 As with a similar list of bishops of Mardin, it is difficult to accept this list as genuine. Towards the end of the fifteenth century Amid appears to have been under the authority of the metropolitan Eliya of Nisibis, who is mentioned in the dating formulas of a number of manuscripts copied between 1477 and 1483. The colophon of a manuscript copied in Mardin in 1502 mentions a metropolitan named Eliya. He is possibly to be identified with the above-mentioned metropolitan Eliya of Nisibis but more probably with the metropolitan Eliya of Gazarta, mentioned in the colophon of a manuscript of 1504. Chaldean bishops of Amid The Chaldean diocese of Amid seems to have been founded by Yohannan Sulaqa shortly after the schism of 1552 that divided the Church of the East into the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean Church. The monk Hormizd Habib, of the Asmar family of Amid, was consecrated metropolitan of Amid by Sulaqa on 19 November 1553, taking the name Eliya. He was sent to India with Sulaqa's brother Joseph in 1555 by the second Chaldean patriarch Abdisho IV Maron, and appears to have returned to Mesopotamia early in 1561. Thereafter he is mentioned as metropolitan of Amid, associated with the patriarchs Abdisho IV and Eliya VII, in a series of manuscripts from 1562 to 1579. He was able to convert the patriarch Shemon IX Denha to Catholicism, was created procurator by a synod of East Syriac bishops in 1580, and was sent on a mission to Rome to seek his confirmation by the Vatican. He died in Lebanon in 1582, on his return from Rome. An archbishop of Amid named Joseph Eliya is mentioned by Leonard Abel in 1583, and is also included in his list of the more lettered Nestorians in 1587. The metropolitan Eliya Bar Tappe, dependent on the patriarch Eliya VIII, is mentioned under a variety of titles in the dating formulas or colophons of several manuscripts between 1599 and 1618. He is listed in the reports of 1607 and 1610 as metropolitan of Amid, and a bishop Isho‚Äòyahb of Seert is separately listed. He was one of a number of bishops addressed by Peter Strozza in a letter of 1614. In 1616 he was present at the synod of Amid as metropolitan of Seert, but up to 1612 seems to have been responsible for the diocese of Amid as well. In 1615, after his return from Rome, the archdeacon Rabban Adam was consecrated metropolitan of Amid. He took the name Timothy, after the disciple of the apostle Paul, in compliment to pope Paul V. He was present at the synod of Amid in 1616, and signed its acts as 'metropolitan of Jerusalem and Amid'. He signed the profession of faith of Eliya IX in 1617 as 'archbishop of Jerusalem'. He is mentioned in the dating formula of a manuscript of 1619, and is said to have died of plague in 1621 or 1622. The note recording his death styled him 'metropolitan of Amid, Nisibis, Mardin, Hesna and Jerusalem'. After Timothy's death Ishoyahb, nephew of Eliya Bar Tappe and metropolitan of Seert since 1619, seems to have been responsible for Amid also until his death in 1628. A metropolitan named Joseph Ishoyahb, probably the same man, is mentioned together with the patriarch Eliya in the dating formula of a manuscript copied at Aleppo in 1626, suggesting that Aleppo was under the jurisdiction of the metropolitans of Amid at this period. Thereafter the diocese of Amid seems to have been vacant for ten years until it was filled by the metropolitan Shemon, who was the scribe of manuscripts of 1637 and 1638 and is mentioned in the dating formulas of a number of manuscripts between 1651 and 1657. He is associated in these manuscripts with the Qochanes patriarch Shemon XI, a known supporter of the union with Rome, probably because of his Catholic sympathies. A metropolitan of Amid named Abdisho was one of the signatories of a letter of 22 November 1669 from the patriarch Eliya X to pope Clement IX. He was succeeded very soon afterwards by Joseph, the future Amid patriarch, who was also dependent on the Eliya line. In 1672, not long after his consecration, Joseph became a Catholic, and was recognised as an independent archbishop of Amid and Mardin by the Turkish authorities in the face of strenuous opposition from the Nestorian patriarch Eliya X. Not all Amid's East Syriac Christians followed him, however, and a group loyal to Eliya X put forward one of their number, a man named David, who was consecrated by the Nestorian patriarch in opposition to Joseph in 1673. David seems to have resided in Amid for only four years, and on Joseph's return from Rome in 1677 'fled to Egypt, where he has not been heard of since'. Joseph I became patriarch of the Amid Chaldeans in 1681. His health began to deteriorate soon afterwards, and he chose as his successor the Catholic poet Sliba Maruf of Telkepe, whom he ordained as a priest in 1689, giving him the name Joseph, and metropolitan of Amid in 1691. He left Amid again in August 1694 for a second visit to Rome, where he remained until his death in 1707. In 1696 the metropolitan Joseph was recognised by the Vatican as the Amid patriarch Joseph II. Timothy Maroge of Baghdad, the future Amid patriarch Joseph III, was consecrated metropolitan of Amid by Joseph II c.1705. He had been a metropolitan for three years and was ministering to the Chaldeans of Mardin when he was recalled to Amid on the outbreak of the plague of 1708. According to the narrative of the Syrian Catholic priest Eliya ibn al-Qsir, he was the only Chaldean bishop to have survived the plague. He was elected patriarch in 1713, a few months after the death of Joseph II in 1712. Between 1717 and 1728 the metropolitan of Amid was Abd al-Ahad, son of Garabet, of A√Øn Tannur, author of a Life of Joseph I, who took the name Basil. He was consecrated by Timothy III in the village of A√Øn Tannur on Sunday, 5 November 1717. He died on 3 January 1728. His Catholic profession of faith is given by Assemani. He was succeeded by Timothy Masaji, who was consecrated by Joseph III, and seems to have been metropolitan of Amid for nearly thirty years. According to one source, he died on 31 December 1756, but Tfinkdji states that he died on 1 January 1757, 'poisoned by the heretics, it is said'. According to Cardinal Tamburini, Joseph III consecrated a 23- or 25-year-old priest named Antony Gallo as his coadjutor on 20 November 1754, with the intention that he would eventually succeed him as Amid patriarch. Following protests by the Catholics of Amid his election as coadjutor was disallowed by the Vatican, and he died shortly afterwards, on 11 January 1757. Tisserant has suggested that Antony was also metropolitan of Amid from 1754 onwards, but it seems more likely that Timothy Masaji remained metropolitan of Amid until his death. Timothy Masaji was succeeded in 1757 by Lazar Hindi, who had been educated at the Propaganda. Lazar Hindi, who also took the name Timothy, was consecrated on 8 February 1757 by Basil, bishop of Mardin, shortly after the death of Joseph III in January 1757. He succeeded Joseph III as the fourth Amid patriarch shortly afterwards, and his transfer from the see of Amid and appointment as patriarch was confirmed by the Vatican on 25 March 1759. He was succeeded by Yohannan al-Akkari (1760‚Äì77), who is mentioned in the dating formula of a manuscript of 1766/7, and then by Augustine Hindi (1777‚Äì1804). Basil Asmar of Telkepe, a monk of the monastery of Rabban Hormizd and metropolitan of Amadiya since 1824, fled to Amid in 1827 after being expelled from Telkepe by Yohannan Hormizd, and was consecrated metropolitan of Amid after the death of Augustine Hindi. On his death in 1842 he was succeeded by Giwargis Peter di Natale, the coadjutor of the patriarch Yohannan VIII Hormizd, who died in 1867. Peter Timothy Attar was metropolitan of Amid from 1870 to 1873. He was succeeded in 1874 by Abdisho Giwargis Khayyat, previously metropolitan of Amadiya, who became patriarch in 1894. The last Chaldean bishop of Amid was Shlemun Mushe al-Sabbagh, who succeeded Giwargis Abdisho Khayyat in 1897. He left his diocese in 1915, during the massacres of Christians in the region. According to his epitaph in the Chaldean church of Mar Pethion in Amid, in which his name is given as Shlemun Bar Sra, he was born in Mosul in April 1865, became a priest in April 1888, was consecrated metropolitan of Amid and Maiperqat in September 1897, and died in June 1929. The title of Amid, often now known as the Archeparchy of Diyarbakir, was revived by the Chaldean church in 1966 for the sole remaining Chaldean diocese in Turkey, whose bishop resided in Istanbul.  Population statistics  Amid (Diyarbakr) and its environs A number of statistics are available for the Chaldean diocese of Amid. In 1757 it contained 3 churches and 5,000 believers (Hindi). In 1818 only three Jacobite villages, two Armenian villages, and the Chaldean village of Sharukhiya remained in the immediate vicinity of the city of Amid (Campanile). In 1850 the diocese consisted of Amid itself and the villages of Sharukhiya and 'Ali Pasha' (A√Øn Tannur), with two churches, four priests, and 150 Chaldean families (Badger). In 1867 it had 2 villages, 6 priests and 2,000 believers (Martin). In 1896 the diocese of Amid had 3,000 Chaldeans, with parishes for Sharukhiya and Maiperqat, and stations in the villages of Boshat and Bakos (Chabot). The diocese had 3 churches, with a chapel at A√Øn Tannur. The diocese of Amid contained 9 villages, 12 priests and 4,180 believers in 1913 (Tfinkdji). By then it also included the villages of 'Navdacht', 'Z√©r√©' and 'Attche' (Hattakh near Maiperqat), which lay in the plain between the Tigris and Sasun rivers, and had been recently converted from the Assyrian Church of the East.

Riding a recliner which he had earlier fitted with a lawnmower engine, Anderson crashed into a car after leaving a local bar, where he had drunk a number of beers. The driver was convicted and the chair was confiscated by the police. The police auctioned the recliner away on Do- Bid.com for $3,700, which was much less than the price it had originally seemed to generate. Though widely reported to be a La-Z-Boy, the chair was in fact not of this brand. Incident 62-year-old Dennis LeRoy Anderson fitted his recliner with a lawnmower engine, wheels and steering wheel, which allowed the chair to reach up to 20 miles (32 km) per hour. He had also installed a stereo, cup holders, headlights and a power antenna. On August 31, 2009, he left a local bar in Proctor, Minnesota, after having drunk eight or nine beers, and crashed into a car in the parking lot. When the police picked him up, his blood alcohol content was measured at 0.29 percent. Anderson was sentenced to 180 days in jail and was fined $2,000. The jail time, and half the fine, was made probational. According to Minnesota law, a \\"motor vehicle\\" is taken to mean \\"every vehicle that is self-propelled and every vehicle that is propelled by electric power obtained from overhead trolley wires.\\" This means that a driver of any motorized vehicle, even a recliner, is liable under DWI legislation. Anderson's blood alcohol content was three times over the legal limit for the state. In addition to this, vehicles can also be confiscated if the driver has a blood alcohol level over 0.2, or has a prior DWI conviction from the last 10 years. Anderson, in addition to having a blood alcohol level well over that limit, also had a prior conviction. Auction On October 29, Proctor police put the seized chair up for auction on eBay, as a motorized La-Z-Boy. The auction was to run for five days, with an opening bid at $500. By November 2one day before bidding was to endthe item had reached $43,700. It was then that the police department was contacted by La-Z- Boy corporation pointing out that the chair was not their product and request that the description to be accordingly changed. The police had simply used the description employed by the media. The request was fulfilled but eBay pulled the item from their listings, and the listing had to start anew. The chair was finally auctioned off successfully for a third time. A Duluth area resident placed the winning $3,700 bid.

From 1999 until 2006, Ruppert edited and published From The Wilderness, a newsletter and website covering a range of topics including international politics, the CIA, peak oil, civil liberties, drugs, economics, corruption and the nature of the 9/11 conspiracy. It attracted 22,000 subscribers. Ruppert was the subject of the 2009 documentary film Collapse, which is based on his book A Presidential Energy Policy and received The New York Times' \\"critics pick\\". He served as president of Collapse Network, Inc. from early 2010 until he resigned in May 2012. He also hosted The Lifeboat Hour on Progressive Radio Network until his death in 2014. In 2014, Vice featured Ruppert in a 6-part series titled Apocalypse, Man, and a tribute album, Beyond the Rubicon was released by the band New White Trash, of which he had been a member. Early life and education Michael Ruppert was born on February 3, 1951 in Washington, D.C. His father, Ernest Charles Edward Ruppert III, had been a pilot in the US Air Force during World War II and later worked for Martin Marietta, functioning as a liaison between the company, the CIA, and the Air Force. His mother, Madelyn, was a cryptanalyst at the National Security Agency, working in a unit that cracked Soviet codes in order to track their nuclear physicists. The family moved fourteen times, living in seven different states, eventually settling in Los Angeles where Ruppert attended Venice High School, graduating in 1969. He then attended UCLA, earning a B.A. in Political Science in 1973. During his senior year, he applied and interviewed for a position with the CIA but ended up turning down the subsequent offer, instead accepting a position with the Los Angeles Police Department. Los Angeles Police Department (1973‚Äì1978) thumb Ruppert joined the LAPD in 1973. He was assigned to handle narcotics investigations in the most dangerous neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Beginning in 1976, he made discoveries that led him to believe that he had stumbled onto a large network of narcotics traffickers and that the US military as well as the LAPD might be involved. He resigned from the force in November 1978. Activism On November 15, 1996, then Director of Central Intelligence John Deutch visited Los Angeles' Locke High School for a town hall meeting. At the meeting, Ruppert publicly confronted Deutch, saying that in his experience as an LAPD narcotics officer he had seen evidence of CIA complicity in drug dealing. He went on to become an investigative journalist and established the publication From The Wilderness, a watchdog publication that exposed governmental corruption, including his experience with CIA drug dealing activities. Ruppert is the author of Crossing The Rubicon: The Decline of the American Empire at the End of the Age of Oil, published in September 2004. Crossing The Rubicon suggests that Vice President Dick Cheney, the US government, and Wall Street had a well-developed awareness of and colluded with the perpetrators of 9/11. Ruppert correctly predicted the 2008 financial crisis in the US three years before it happened. =From The Wilderness= From The Wilderness was a newsletter published from 1998 to 2006 by the media company, From The Wilderness Publications. The newsletter covered political and governmental issues. It was published eleven times per year but featured weekly updates online. In the summer of 2006, claiming government harassment, and fearing for his life, Ruppert left the United States with Raul Santiago for Venezuela, vowing not to return. The Ashland Daily Tidings reported that, in June 2006, Ruppert had accused a former female employee of burglarizing the offices of From The Wilderness, a case in which Ruppert himself was considered a potential suspect. Around the same time, the former female employee accused him in turn of sexual harassment. She said that Ruppert had fired her after she refused his sexual advances. Ruppert denied that he had sexually harassed her, and said that \\"the case was based on a deliberate attempt to discredit his work, a movie coming out about his views and his former newsletter, From The Wilderness.\\" In 2009, Ruppert was ordered to pay a $125,000 fine by the Oregon labor board in the case. The end of From The Wilderness was announced in a post at the website on November 7, 2006. Reasons for the closure were detailed in the article. Ruppert claimed his bad health, glitches that disabled their web store, \\"problems of human origin\\" and his departure to Venezuela had led to the demise of From The Wilderness. After shutting down, From the Wilderness was sued by their landlord for unpaid rent owed on their Ashland office space. Later that year, Ruppert flew to Toronto, Canada, for medical treatment. The following statement was posted on the From The Wilderness website on November 26, 2006: =Collapse and the Collapse Network= Ruppert and his theories on peak oil were the subject of the 2009 documentary film Collapse, which was based on his book A Presidential Energy Policy and received The New York Times' \\"critics pick\\". The book, Confronting Collapse: The Crisis of Energy and Money in a Post Peak Oil World was released in December 2009. Peak oil, an event based on M. King Hubbert's theory, is the point in time when the maximum rate of extraction of petroleum is reached, after which the rate of production is expected to enter terminal decline. Peak oil theory is based on the observed rise, peak, (sometimes rapid) fall, and depletion of aggregate production rate in oil fields over time. In early 2010, Ruppert launched the Collapse Network to build sustainable communities across the world. In 2011 he announced on his Lifeboat Hour radio show that he was relocating to Sonoma County, California, because he thought that it would be a safer location in the event of societal collapse. He left the Collapse Network in May 2012, leaving it in the hands of former From the Wilderness associate and longtime friend, Jenna Orkin. Ruppert continued to occasionally contribute to the Collapse Network news desk. Musical projects After leaving CollapseNet, Ruppert moved to Crestone, Colorado and pursued Native American and indigenous teachings (adopting the name \\"Tracker of Truth\\") and started putting more time into music, recording with the band New White Trash, described as a \\"downtempo acoustic rock outfit\\". =New White Trash= New White Trash was a downtempo acoustic rock band. Michael Ruppert was a founding member, along with singer Kristen Vigard, drummer Andy Kravitz, and guitarist Doug Lewis. The band released two albums, Doublewide (2011) and Age of Authority (2013). Following Ruppert's suicide in 2014, the band announced its intention to release a tribute album. Beyond the Rubicon was released on December 11, 2014. Media coverage and criticism Numerous documentary films have featured Ruppert, including The End of Suburbia (2004), Liberty Bound (2004), American Drug War: The Last White Hope (2007), The 911 Report You Never Saw - The Great Conspiracy (2008), Collapse (2009), Zeitgeist: Moving Forward (2011), and Apocalypse, Man (2014). Ruppert was termed a \\"conspiracy theorist\\", to which he has said he \\"deals with 'conspiracy fact' rather than theory.\\" According to The Wall Street Journal, his book Crossing the Rubicon was a \\"favorite among conspiracy theorists.\\" After writing it, and subsequently moving on to peak oil, he said \\"I walked away from 9/11 five years ago,\\" he says. \\"I have nothing to do with the 9/11 truth movement.\\" Critic David Corn argued that Ruppert on occasion veered off into making unsubstantiated conspiracy theory claims and has criticized Ruppert's methodology, dismissing the idea that conspiracy theorizing is useful: \\"In fact, out-there conspiracy theorizing serves the interests of the powers-that- be by making their real transgressions seem tame in comparison.\\" Ruppert responded with an open public letter to Corn stating that Corn is not able to disprove any of Ruppert's claims. The New York Times, in its review of Collapse, wrote \\"the majority of his premises are verifiable, any weakness in his argument lies in inferences so terrifying that reasonable listeners may find themselves taking his advice\\" and that in it, Ruppert \\"emerges finally as an authentic human being, sympathetic even when the film that embraces him is not.\\" In 2014, Vice featured Ruppert in a 6-part series titled Apocalypse, Man. Death On April 13, 2014, Ruppert was found dead in Napa County at home just outside the Calistoga, California city limits. Ruppert died of a single self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. This was confirmed by close friend and property owner and landlord Jack Martin. Martin found Ruppert's body and suicide note. According to his business partner and last attorney of record, Wesley Miller, Ruppert shot himself after taping his final broadcast of The Lifeboat Hour with friend and colleague Carolyn Baker, Ph.D. On the subject of his own death, Ruppert said: Works =Bibliography= ;Books ;Selected articles  =Appearances=  =New White Trash discography= ;Music videos ;Video interview * See also * Counter Misinformation Team * Michel Chossudovsky * Cynthia McKinney * Dmitry Orlov * Gary Webb Notes References      ;Obituaries and memoria Further reading ;Reviews of Collapse External links forwards to Lifeboat Hour Archives at the Progressive Radio Network *Mike Ruppert on YouTube (lectures and interviews) * 1951 births 2014 deaths 9/11 conspiracy theorists Alternative journalists American investigative journalists American rock musicians American conspiracy theorists Journalists from California Journalists who committed suicide Los Angeles Police Department officers Male suicides Musicians from Ashland, Oregon People from Calistoga, California People from Saguache County, Colorado Suicides by firearm in California University of California, Los Angeles alumni Writers from Ashland, Oregon Activists from California ","title":"Michael Ruppert"},{"id":"25063718","text":"Before I Self Destructhttp://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1625762/50-cent- screens-before-i-self-destruct-film-new-york.jhtml is a 2009 American direct- to-video crime drama filmhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt1310569/ starring Curtis Jackson, who also served as writer, director, producer and executive producer that is included with his fourth studio album of the same name.

He longs for pretty girls he feels are beyond his reach, including a woman named Princess (Sasha Delvalle). After Donna is accidentally shot and killed by a gunman named Tiny (Shorty Red) in a drive-by shooting, Clarence is unsure how to prevent Shocka, who has already been accepted to all eight Ivy League universities, from going into foster care. After being fired from his job and coming back to find an eviction notice at his door, Clarence finds Tiny and kills him with a revolver that he finds beneath the bed at his hotel room. He then visits Sean (Clifton Powell), who is the local crime boss, to inform him that he killed Tiny who had previously worked for Sean. Sean likes Clarence's style and he hires him to be his new hitman. After obtaining financial success from his newly found criminal lifestyle and becoming able to provide to his brother, Clarence runs into Princess, the beautiful woman from the supermarket. He begins to develop a close bond with Princess but is unable to realize that she is using him. Clarence bestows gold, diamonds and payback when Princess's ex-boyfriend Rafael (Gabriel Ellis) gets released from prison. Rafael tracks Princess down by using her mother's phone to call her and she answers the phone while in bed with Clarence pretending it is her mom. When Rafael demands the money he gave her for safekeeping, she meets up with him and they have sex but when he again demands she hand over his money, the only thing Princess says is \\"Clarence\\", implying that she gave Clarence Rafael's money. In order to take back his money, Rafael has her call Clarence and ask him to come to her mom's house to help move furniture. Princess and Rafael wait in his car across the street from her mom's house. As soon as Clarence steps out of the car, Rafael fatally shoots Clarence.

It is also known as bofrot or puff puff in Western African countries such as Ghana and Nigeria. It is one of the principal dishes in the cuisine of the Swahili people who inhabit the Coastal Region of Kenya and Tanzania. The dish is popular in the region, as it is convenient to make, can be eaten with almost any food or dips or just as a snack by itself, and can be saved and reheated for later consumption. Characteristics Mandazi are similar to doughnuts, having a little bit of a sweet taste which can be differentiated with the addition of different ingredients. However; they are typically less sweet than the United States style of doughnuts and are usually served without any glazing or frosting. They are frequently made triangular in shape (similar to samosas), but are also commonly shaped as circles or ovals. When cooked, they have a \\"fluffy\\" texture. Preparation Mandazi being fried Mandazi are made by briefly cooking the dough in cooking oil. The ingredients typically used to make mandazi include water, sugar, flour, yeast, and milk. Coconut milk is also commonly added for sweetness. When coconut milk is added, mandazi are commonly referred to as mahamri or mamri. Ground peanuts and almonds, among other ingredients, can also be used to add a different flavor. After being cooked, they can be eaten warm or left to cool down. They are popular in the African Great Lakes region, as they can be eaten in accompaniment with many things. They are commonly made in the morning or the night before, eaten with breakfast, then re-heated in the evening for dinner. Mandazi are also commonly eaten with tea or fresh fruit juice, or are eaten as snacks by themselves. Different dips, often fruit flavored, can be used to add various tastes. Mandazi can also be eaten as a dessert after a meal where it is often served with powdered or cinnamon sugar to add sweetness. They are also a popular snack in the region.

It is initially a free application available at the iTunes Store but users are encouraged to and often buy upgrades. Features Jet Fighters (Jets) features push notifications for 3.0 without extra text messaging charges. Users are notified when attacked, are able to invite friends to battle and can receive messages friends during the gameplay. Jets also features updates with new missions, planes, missiles, and gifts from the \\"General\\". Jets allows users to customize their planes, attack other players online with all statistics of wins and losses kept in the user's profile. Gameplay In order to play Jets you must have active iPhone or iPod Touch with a working internet connection and access to the iTunes Store. After downloading the game from the iTunes Store and opening the game, the \\"home\\" screen appears. You are immediately awarded \\"honor points\\", usually in increments of 10 units. The points can be used to create cash in the game or enhance the users's health, fuel, energy or friends on the user's squad. The choices for allocation of these points are found in the \\"General\\" screen. Once obtained money can then be used to either purchase weapons, deposited in Fort Knox, or to purchase any number of military bases. =Weapon systems= Once the weapon systems icon is touched, the game opens to a screen the gives you three options on how to spend cash: guns, armor and planes. Each of the items is important because the accumulation of each item helps in the \\"battle\\" section of the game. =Air strike= Once the Air strike icon is touched, the game opens to a page with a list of 10 other users/pilots on an equal experience level. Tapping on the attack button next to another user's name starts a plane to plane \\"dogfight\\". A statistical battle occurs and based on the number of planes, defenses, weapons and squad members each user has, a winner is determined. In many cases the winner acquires cash from the loser as well as being awarded experience points. After the \\"battle\\" is over, the user is returned to the \\"list of fighters\\" and is able to attack again. When an attack results in the loser's plane being destroyed, that user is no longer seen on the list of pilots having been replaced by another randomly selected pilot/user, presumably from anywhere in the world. Regardless of the outcome of the battle, each attack drains the user of energy and health; more health is lost when the user/pilot loses. Once below unit 26 in health, the user/pilots is sent in for repairs. You can pay cash for the repairs or restoration of health, or just simply wait a few minutes. One unit of health returns every 3 minutes. The user can also go to the General and spend respect points for a full health refill(1 respect point) or a full energy refill(5 points). If you run out of the honor points, the General will gladly sell them to you for real cash through the iTunes Store. =Squad= One of the most critical components of game play in Jets is the number of users on your squad. During each attack, members of your squad are allowed to attack with you up to 10 times the level your on. If the user is one level 2, up to 20 squad members may accompany the user during the statistical attack, level 3, up to 30 and so on. Thus one user with same number of weapons, armor and fighters as another user, but with more crew will prevail in the statistical dogfight, taking cash and experience. Squad members are acquired by asking other users to join your squad. The game offers a \\"location invite\\" tool which employs gps and triangulation to find users geographically close by and invites them; or the user can \\"post\\" the user's 9 digit friend code and ask other users to punch the code into their \\"invite friend by code\\" section. For example, typing in 322 061 776 will notify that user of an invitation, once 322 061 776 responds, the number of crew members increases near the top of the home screen. =Military Bases= Owning Military Bases is the only way to generate recurring Cash Flow Income in Jet Fighters. Generally, the income from your military bases will significantly exceed that earned from fighting or missions. Given the high upkeep of the better weapons systems and the relatively low income from the available military bases, it is especially critical that you maximize your military base income. The Income provided by military bases is earned every 50 or 60 minutes depending on your character type. This occurs whether or not you or actively playing. Upkeep costs are automatically deducted at the same time. The key to maximizing your income from Military Bases is understanding the concept of Return on Investment (ROI). If you view military bases as an investment of your cash, then the ROI on that investment is equal to the income provided by that base divided by its current cost. This number is commonly expressed as a percentage and indicates the rate of return for that particular base. When choosing which military base to buy, you should always choose the one that provides the highest available ROI in order to maximize your investment and income. The cost of each military base increases by 10% with each purchase, decreasing its ROI. This provides incentive to advance in level in order to unlock additional military base types that provide a higher ROI. Online Jet Fighters Calculators can help you determine which military bases you should buy given your bankroll and level.

Political career Hyndman was born in Edmonton, Alberta. He worked as a lawyer until 1967 when he ran for office and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. From 1967 through 1986, when he rejoined the law firm of Field Atkinson Perraton, Hyndman served as the Minister of Education, Minister of Federal and Intergovernmental Affairs, Government House Leader, and Provincial Treasurer. Hyndman first ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature in the 1967 Alberta general election. He won a tight race in the electoral district of Edmonton West to pick it up for the Progressive Conservatives. He was one of six members of his party elected that year who form the official opposition. Due to redistribution in the 1971 general election, the electoral district of Edmonton West was abolished. Hyndman ran for re-election in the new electoral district of Edmonton-Glenora. He was re-elected to the legislature with a sizable majority. The Progressive Conservatives under the leadership of Peter Lougheed formed government. Hyndman was appointed to the Executive Council of Alberta shortly after the election as Minister of Education. Running for re- election as a cabinet minister in the 1975 general election, Hyndman slightly increased his popular vote. He won his district with a landslide as the opposition vote collapsed. Hyndman defeated future Member of the Legislative Assembly Alex McEachern and two other candidates. Immediately following the election Hyndman was shuffled to become the Minister of Federal and Intergovernmental Affairs. He ran for his fourth term in office in the 1979 general election. Hyndman's popular vote waned slightly from the previous election. There was no significant strength in the opposition vote. He still won his district with a landslide majority. Lougheed appointed Hyndman as the new Provincial Treasurer following the election. Hyndman's fifth election would see him reclaim the votes he lost in 1979. He won his final term in office in the 1982 general election easily defeating three other candidates. Hyndman held the Provincial Treasurer portfolio after Don Getty became Premier in 1985. Hyndman retired from the legislature at dissolution in 1986. Late life After leaving provincial politics in 1986 Hyndman joined the board of directors for TransAlta Utilities. Hyndman also resumed his work as a lawyer with the firm now known as Field Law. He became chancellor of the University of Alberta. He was awarded an honorary degree by the University on June 12, 2000. Hyndman died November 24, 2013 in Edmonton at the age of 78, after an illness.

History  In 1999, Deacon the Villain and Kno met at Club Kaya in Atlanta, Georgia at an event for the now defunct Blaze Magazine that included various members of Atlanta's own Dungeon Family. They had talked online previously through an emcee named Jugga the Bully, who appeared at an open mic called Underground Live at Morehouse college campus, which was held by Deacon. At the time, Kno was in the group The Continuum, and Deacon was in the group ILLSTAR. Afterwards, the two disbanded from their former groups and created CunninLynguists. The two also founded a production duo named A Piece Of Strange. Around 2004, Deacon formed the group Kynfolk with Natti. The two got along so well that Deacon and Kno invited Natti to join CunninLynguists. Deacon released his first full length project not in CunninLynguists with JustMe, named Tragedy & Dope. The same year, he released Niggaz With Latitude (N.W.L.) with Sheisty Khrist, another Kentucky emcee. In 2015, he released his first solo album Peace or Power. The album is self- produced and guest appearances include Tonedeff, Kno and Homeboy Sandman, among others.

Martin Woods of Chillbase describes Liquid Stranger's music as a \\"unique blend of Ambience, Big Band Jazz, Dubstep and Psychedelica drizzled over electronic Dub Reggae grooves.\\" St√§√§f lives in Scottsdale, Arizona. History = Early years = Martin St√§√§f was born 13 November 1978 in Varberg on the Swedish West Coast. He started playing the piano and did classical piano concerts between the ages of 6‚Äì8. St√§√§f started experimenting with synthesizers in the mid 80s and abandoned the classical music world to spend the next 10 years producing his own material. St√§√§f states: ‚ÄùI never thought about releasing any of my music until I was 17. Then, all of a sudden, it was time to get a job and I realized that there was nothing else I wanted to do at that time than making music.‚Äù =Early career: late 1990s= Martin St√§√§f worked in the commercial studio Bohus Sound Recordings 1997‚Äì1999 and engineered/produced various jazz and rock bands. During this time he also made a song for the Euro-Vision contest. In 1997 Martin St√§√§f formed the outfit Necton together with Patrik Ols√©n, mainly focusing on progressive and psychedelic trance. Necton released two full-length albums, 6 vinyl EPs, and were featured on numerous CD compilations. They were signed to Spirit Zone Recordings, Digital Structures and Spiral Trax. Necton toured extensively around the world between 1997‚Äì2003. During this time, Martin St√§√§f released Nu Skool Breaks on labels Ministry of Sound, Sound of Habib, Muti Music, Random Recordings, Hope Recordings, and Muve Recordings under the alias Rhoca. St√§√§f also released funky Techno on Iboga Records, Plusquam Records, and Nanobeat Records. =The Liquid Stranger Project: 2003‚Äì2009= Martin St√§√§f launched the Liquid Stranger project in 2003. His intention was to have one alias that would encompass all his musical output. Consequently, he has produced a wide variety of music under the name Liquid Stranger. At first, St√§√§f's plan was to keep his identity a secret. He never did interviews or showed his face on stage. St√§√§f states: ‚ÄùAfter a while it became quite tricky. in fact, Interchill finally ruined this idea by writing my name on the record sleeves.‚Äù Liquid Stranger's creative output ranges from suggestive Ambient soundscapes to movie scores, pop, dub, infernalia, drill n bass, and electronica. The first release under the name Liquid Stranger was the song Environmental Meltdown, featured on the compilation Global Psychedelic Chill Out ‚Äì Compilation Vol. 4 by Spirit Zone Recordings. When asked in an interview why he moved away from the trance scene, St√§√§f replied: ‚ÄùI never really switched per se, I have always made tons of different types of music. During the time I toured with Necton, I produced various stuff like Ambient, Electro and Drill n bass. What excites me is the fusing of genres. I have no fixed style that I stay with too long, I do not like boundaries.\\" =Subnatura collective= In 2003, Martin St√§√§f founded the musical collective Subnatura together with Marckus Andersson. Subnatura released 12 digital Ep's and were featured on net label Monotonik and the video DVD Collectanea: First Course, released by Escapi Music. =Candy Mind records= In 2004, Martin St√§√§f founded the record label Candy Mind Records together with his brother Jens St√§√§f.

They released the full-length album Anywhere And Me on Kahvi records. The Ep's Pixels and Pixies, and Alive in Veddige were released on Candy Mind Records. =Interchill records= In 2005, St√§√§f got signed to Canadian label Interchill Records. The song Political Finga was featured on Earth Octave Lounge Vol. 2, and received high praise from the dub community. The song Liquid Stranger on the Run appeared on the compilation Dissolving Clouds and got frequent plays on underground radio. Rick Anderson of Allmusic wrote about Liquid Stranger \\"As someone who has previously worked in progressive rock, punk, techno, breakbeat, and IDM genres, Staaf brings a certain sophistication to his Interchill-style dubtronica, and there is lots to hear for those who take the trouble to listen closely: the brass and orchestral samples bubbling beneath the surface of the gently churning dub of Liquid Stranger on the Run.‚Äù The song We Meet at Last appeared on the compilation Bliminal, and was licensed by Velcrow Ripper for the film Fierce Light ‚Äì Where Spirit Meets Action, released in 2008. =The Invisible Conquest= The first full-length Liquid Stranger album, The Invisible Conquest, was released by Interchill Records in 2007. A bass-heavy album with melodic bass lines, percussive grooves, tribal accents and minimal psychedelic overlays. The Invisible Conquest received high ratings and praise from critics. Properly Chilled wrote of the album \\"Liquid Stranger's sound has the grandeur of its peers without building an humongous ego. . .we give this record two thumbs way up and a standing ovation\\", and Raves.com described it as \\"A taste of the experimental, a chunk of tribal, all wrapped around a root of dub excellence. . .dub vibes that shoot right through to the middle of your gut.\\" Morpeus Music describes the music of Liquid Stranger as \\"Bass driven atmospheric chillout. Liquid Stranger creates mostly instrumental montages with strong rhythmic content.\\" =The Intergalactic Slapstick= The second full-length Liquid Stranger album was released by Interchill Records in 2009. This album saw Liquid Stranger moving significantly into heavier Dubstep and reggae influenced grooves. Vocalists Brother Culture, Danman, Deeyah and Warrior Queen are featured on the album. Seb Taylor from Kaya Project plays Steel Guitar on the songs His Fully Automatic Wheelbarrow, and Dew Point. Dub- connection wrote of the album \\"the production varies and waves between a electro-dub chill-out and powerful tracks in the limit of drum and bass with a bit of stepper to spice the sound.\\" Morpheus Music wrote of the album \\"The diverse roots of Liquid Stranger's sound sprawl across electro, ambient, grime, global, breaks and garage.\\" =The Private Riot= The third full- length Liquid Stranger album was released on Rottun Recordings on March 15, 2010. This album features 10 dark and energetic Dubstep songs, described by Music and Happy Life as \\"totally devastating dance-floor monsters.\\" The album received high praise in the electronic music scene, with the song \\"Ripple\\" hitting number 1 on Beatport's top download charts for an extended period of time. =Mechanoid Meltdown= Liquid Stranger's fourth full-length album was also released on Rottun Recordings in 2010 on November 29. The album includes Dubstep songs and two Drum and Bass tracks. Background information = Influences = Martin St√§√§f mentioned in an interview on BBC radio that his main influence comes from music from vintage computer games. In an interview with Chillbase, St√§√§f says that he does not listen to music all that much, except when he is on a concert. In the same interview St√§√§f explains that he gets inspiration from movie soundtracks, dreams, and everyday life.

In use, the term can be applied to all civil servants, not just those who attain notoriety. In American contexts, this concept is known by economists as a revolving door. The practice is often viewed negatively by the public.  Origin  Early on, in slang usage at the √âcole Polytechnique, the word \\"pantoufle\\" (French for slipper) referred to the act of avoiding public service after study. Those who \\"trained in the pantoufle,\\" the \\"pantouflards,\\" carried the title of \\"former student of the √âcole Polytechnique,\\" and gave up the right to the \\"Diploma of the √âcole Polytechnique\\".Albert-L√©vy et G. Pinet L'argot de l'X illustr√© par les X Preface by Armand Silvestre, Emile Testard, Paris, 1894, xiii + 327 pp., pp.218-220. Later, the term also came to refer to the repayment of education costs by individuals who had failed to serve ten years in civil service after obtaining their degree (this is comparable to the practice of \\"dedit-formation\\" in France, in which employers might be eligible for reimbursement of expenses by employees who resign prematurely). As frequently as civil servants leave public work and acquire the \\"pantoufle,\\" private enterprises recruit students at the conclusion of their studies.Fabrice Mattatia Dictionnaire d'argot de l'X. Tout sur le langage des polytechniciens, 2e √©dition, Lavauzelle 2004. Les droits des pantouflards. Today, the repayment of student costs by the pantoufle is not required except in the most exceptional cases(C.B. et A.J. Pantoufle, pantouflage et pantouflards, Le Figaro, 15 octobre 2007). The term \\"pantouflage\\" also applies to politicians who, following an electoral loss or a termination from a ministerial position, assume a private industry, high-paying position without significant responsibilities. This is often undertaken during an interim period when formerly elected politicians vet new opportunities to assume elected office. French popular phrasing describes this scenario as \\"Emploi fictif,\\" or fake employment.  Figures  Between 1985 and 1990, the Conseil d'√âtat experienced at least four resignations per year. In 1993, the diplomatic corps lost some twenty of its members. The 1992 directory of the corps pr√©fectoral lists some one hundred members in the private sector or in semi-public employment. In May 1990, the review \\"ENA-mensuel\\" estimated that of 4,400 former students of the √âcole nationale d'administration, 737 worked in the private sector. Among these, 6.1% had carried out roles in the Conseil, 8.3% the Court of Audit of France and 18.8% in Financial Oversight. The same year, the Corps of Mines (France) registered 16.8% incidence of pantouflage and in the Corps of Bridges and Roads (France), 14.7% incidence.  Dissemination of pantouflage  The term \\"pantouflage\\" carries a particularly pejorative meaning when it is applied to former civil servants who worked in an administration exercising control over private-sector industry. = France = In France, such movements are supervised under strict legal structures. Thus, according to article 423-13 of the French criminal code, concerning illegal gains through conflicts of interest: The Commission on Ethics for Civil Servants is charged with verifying whether an agent of civil service who assumed a private sector position did so legitimately. Investigations and determinations are undertaken at the request of the manager of the governmental administration from which the individual in question resigned. = Italy = Pantouflage is regulated by Article 53, paragraph 16-ter introduced in Legislative Decree no. 165/01 (Consolidated Act on Public Employment) by Law no. 190/12, the anti-corruption law (‚ÄúProvisions for the prevention and punishment of corruption and illegality in the public administration‚Äù). Article 16-ter provides that: * Employees who, during the last three years of service, have exercised authoritative or negotiating powers on behalf of public authorities pursuant to Article 1, paragraph 2 of Legislative Decree No. 165/01, cannot provide, within three years of their public employment contract being terminated, work or professional services to private parties to whom public authorities have provided services in furtherance of the said powers (1st period); * Contracts entered into and the tasks conferred in violation of the provisions of this paragraph are invalid and the ‚Äúprivate parties who have executed contracts or have been conferred with powers to contract are forbidden from contracting with the public administration for the next three years and are required to return any compensation that they have received and that has been traced back to them‚Äù (2nd period). Paragraph 16-ter must then be read in conjunction with Article 21 of Legislative Decree No. 39 of 8 April 2013 (containing ‚ÄúProvisions detailing appointments that cannot be conferred by public authorities and by publicly controlled private entities and that are to be construed as incompatible‚Äù), which states that ‚Äúfor the sole purpose of applying the prohibitions provided for under paragraph 16-ter‚Äù, those holding of one of the positions provided for under Legislative Decree No. 39/13 (which also include external parties with whom the authority ‚Äúthe public body or the publicly controlled private law entity‚Äù has established a working, employment or free- lance relationship) are also considered to be public employees. The anti- corruption law is expressly intended to implement (i) Article 6 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption, adopted by the UN General Assembly on October 31, 2003 and ratified under Law no. 116 of 3 August 2009, and (ii) Articles 20 and 21 of the Criminal Convention against Corruption, adopted in Strasbourg on 27 January 1999 and ratified under Law no. 110 of 28 June 2012. It identifies at a national level the Italian Anti-Corruption Authority and the other bodies responsible for carrying out control, prevention and punishment activities against corruption and illegality in the public administration in such a way as to ensure a coordinated action. = Japan = The phenomenon of pantouflage exists in Japan where it is termed amakudari, literally, \\"descent from paradise or the sky,\\" in reference to the Japanese mythological shinto descent of gods to earth, and concerns the retirement of civil servants into the private sector.Colignon, Richard A. et Chikako Usui ¬´ Amakudari: the Hidden Fabric of Japan's Economy ¬ª, Cornell University Press, 2003, 224 pp. , . On April 1, 2009, the Aso administration adopted a bill to eliminate this practice by creating a special agency to lure former civil servants back into government employment, as long as former officials do not directly negotiate for higher salaries In his election bid in 2009, the administration of Yukio Hatoyama, pledged to establish this agency upon his assuming power; this was a direct response to critics who assailed him as an \\"amakudari,\\" and to reduce administrative inneficiency. = Quebec = In Quebec, a law on lobbyingLoi qu√©b√©coise sur la transparence et l'√©thique en mati√®re de lobbyisme on the site of the Commissaire au lobbyisme du Qu√©bec restricts former executive directors and assistant executive directors of municipalities in their post-electoral careers. They must not have used information obtained in their former public positions to profit in another enterprise. However, no law forbids private enterprises in communities from hiring former public officials.

Background \\"Candy Kisses\\" is a song composed by country crooner George Morgan, earning that category for his smooth voice. The song developed one day in 1947 while George was on his way to work during his time at WWST radio as an early morning talent. During his commute, he hummed along to his car engine while thinking about an ex-girlfriend whom he just broke up with. He had the song roughly thought up within twenty minutes. The song became his theme song that day over at WWST and he carried his theme song with him into 1948 when he landed a new job at WWVA radio in Wheeling, W. Va. In December 1948, Morgan got a record deal and signed with Columbia Records. Just two weeks later, he was hired as a vocalist replacing Eddy Arnold at the Grand Ole Opry. Morgan debuted there on September 25, 1948 and stayed for the next 27 years. By the age of 24, Morgan recorded \\"Candy Kisses\\" for Columbia Records in January 1949 and the song jumped to number one on the best-selling folk charts where it remained for three weeks. By the end of the year, \\"Candy Kisses\\" sold more than 2 million copies, and had ten top cover versions. This song was also the first song featured on the self titled album \\"Candy Kisses\\".

History =Formation= The team was created to further the motor sport career of 1987 World Motorcycle Champion, Wayne Gardner who retired from motor cycle racing at the end of the 1992 season. After racing with the Holden Racing Team in 1993, a falling out with team owner Tom Walkinshaw saw Gardner leave the team at season's end. In late 1993 Gardner purchased Bob Forbes Racing that had competed in the 1993 season with one VP Commodore driven by Neil Crompton. Initially operating out of Bob Forbes' Mona Vale premises the team relocated to Wetherill Park. Former Gibson Motorsport manager Alan Heaphy was appointed team manager. The team had backing from Coca-Cola, Holden and Dunlop. =1994= The team debuted at round 1 of the 1994 championship with a second VP Commodore built to complement Neil Crompton's 1993 car. Gardner and Crompton's combined in the former's #4 car for the endurance races while Win Percy and Russell Ingall raced #7, finishing fifth at the Bathurst 1000. =1995= Aside from upgrading its cars to VR specifications the team carries on unchanged in 1995.

He was the most successful of a family of masons and architects that included his father Nicostrato and his son Carlo. He was trained in the workshop of Giovan Battista Aleotti, with whom he collaborated at the hexagonal church of Santa Maria del Quartiere, and which he completed after Aleotti's death, altering the design (1604‚Äì1610). He completed Aleotti's indoor theatre for Ranuccio Farnese, the first theatre with changeable scenery. Among his early works on his own are the monument erected in the Duomo to his friend, the painter Agostino Carracci (died 1602),His collaborator, according to the inscription, was Giuseppe Guidetti of Bologna. the altar to Saint Joseph in the Sanctuary of Santa Maria della Steccata (1608) and, in fulfilment of a vow, that for the Carmelites in Santa Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi (1611). In 1622 he was nominated architect to the city, in the service of the Farnese dukes. In this capacity he was responsible for four temporary triumphal arches, one of which was engraved in Milan by Carlo Bianchi, was intended for the festive and solemn first entrata into Parma of Margherita de' Medici following her wedding in Florence to Duke Odoardo I Farnese, 11 October 1628.Simon Jervis, \\"A Seventeenth-Century Book of Engraved Ornament\\", The Burlington Magazine 128 No. 1005 (December 1986:893-903), illustrated p. 895, fig. 44, described p. 897; Irving Lavin, \\"On the Unity of the Arts and the Early Baroque Opera House\\", Perspecta 26 Theater, Theatricality, and Architecture (1990:1-20), p. 10, describing the festivities at length.

Competition is held in several rounds over a six-day period. Windsurfing is the most recently adopted event in this competition. Every year, 50 of the world's top slalom racers attend the competition as a pit stop through the Asian Windsurfing Tour.The Asian Windsurfing Tour Surfers control their surfboard mounted with a sail through a race around buoys. There are typically three \\"jibes\\" or straight ways and turns involved in the course. A total of 24 races are typically held in order to keep congestion down during the slalom. Speed trial races are held in conjunction with the other events. The courses are set up to have areas that speed can be gained, and places where boarders have to maintain balance while winds are not easily assessable. The boarders with the fastest time then compete in a race against each other for the title and honor. The cup takes place on January 9. It is held at Bulabog Beach, since the wind and waters at the White Beach are too mild. Kiteboarding Kitesurfing is common in Boracay because of the wind and water conditions needed for the event. A smaller version surfboard is used with the combination of a parachute apparatus to kiteboard. Kiteboarders harness the power of the wind to move through the water and propel themselves into the air to do tricks. The competing kiteboarders gain point ranks based on the amount, difficulty, and uniqueness of the tricks that they pull within a specific time interval. Typically it consists of a three round elimination, yet if it is close, more rounds may be added. This specific event is available to types of boarding other than kiteboarding.

It links the spa resort of St. Moritz, in the Canton of Graub√ºnden, Switzerland, with the town of Tirano, in the Province of Sondrio, Italy, via the Bernina Pass. Reaching a height of above sea level, it is the highest railway crossing in Europe and the third highest railway in Switzerland. It also ranks as the highest adhesion railway of the continent, and ‚Äì with inclines of up to 7% ‚Äì as one of the steepest adhesion railways in the world. The height difference on the section between the Bernina Pass and Tirano is , allowing passengers to see glaciers and palm trees on the same line. On 7 July 2008, the Bernina Railway and the Albula Railway, which also forms part of the RhB, were recorded in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, under the name Rhaetian Railway in the Albula / Bernina Landscapes. The whole site is regarded as a cross-border joint Swiss-Italian heritage area. Trains operating on the Bernina Railway include the Bernina Express.  History  Bernina Railway with the Pal√º Glacier in the background. Postcard from ca. 1910 Bond of the Berninabahn-Gesellschaft, issued 3. June 1908 In the year following the completion of the Albula Railway in 1904, the Bernina- Bahngesellschaft (BB) was established, with the objective of opening a railway line between St Moritz and Tirano, via the Bernina Pass. Two requirements drove the planning; the need for access to hydro-electric plants on the south side of the Bernina pass, and the provision of access for tourists to tourist attractions of the high mountain area. The concession for the line was obtained in 1906, and the construction was financed by the investors in Kraftwerke Brusio AG, the builders of the hydro-electic works, without the aid of cantonal subsidy. the line opened from 1908 onwards, in several sections: on 1 July 1908 between Pontresina and Morteratasch, and between Tirano and Poschiavo; on 18 August of the same year between Pontresina and Celerina; and on 1 July 1909 between Celerina and St Moritz, and between Morteratsch and Bernina Suot. It was only on 5 July 1910 that the whole line could be opened, upon completion of the most difficult section between Bernina Suot and Poschiavo. The line was electrically operated with DC current from the start. In 1935 the voltage was increased from 750 to 1000 volts. Originally, the Bernina Railway was intended for use only in summer, but in 1913/14 the BB commenced winter operations as well. This development was associated with major weather-related problems, necessitating further erection of avalanche barriers. In the first years of its existence, the BB was always on the verge of bankruptcy. The costs of construction expenditure on the line to 1915 amounted to around 15 million Swiss francs. Even the introduction of a restaurant car in 1928, and packages for tourists, could not save the little railway from ruin. Due to its difficult financial situation, it was taken over by the Rhaetian Railway in 1943. The RhB modernised the line fundamentally, also for military reasons, and completely renewed the section at the top of the pass. Previously, the line formation on the north ramp of the Bernina Pass had been laid out in curves giving passengers extensive views, but also lying in the path of avalanche courses. The new parts of the line cut off those curves, the catenary and the flat bottomed rails of the old formation were removed, but the substructure is still visible in the high mountains. Since the mid-1980s, the Rhaetian Railway has been marketing the natural and technical attractions of the Bernina Railway specifically to tourists. Thus, the section from Pontresina to Tirano forms part of the route of the Bernina Express. In October 2011, it was the first rail line in the world to be photographed and put on Google Street View.Google Street View on Bernina Railway, Netzwelt, October 19th, 2011 (german) Description of the railway St Moritz station St Moritz is the terminus of both the Albula Railway and the Bernina Railway. As the two railways are powered by different electrification systems, they meet at the same station, but operate on separate lines from separate platforms. The Bernina Railway leaves St Moritz station in an easterly direction, and crosses the Inn River on a long viaduct. It then passes through the long Charnad√ºra-Tunnel II, the longest tunnel on the entire route. The next station, Celerina Staz, is, at above sea level, the lowest point on the north side of the Bernina Pass. From there until Ospizio Bernina, the line will now climb almost continuously. After returning to the banks of the Inn, the line reaches the small station Punt Muragl Staz. At this point is the valley station of the funicular to Muottas Muragl, opened in 1907. Pontresina station The next station in Pontresina represents, together with St Moritz station, a curiosity in the network of the RhB: two completely different electrification systems meet here. The 11 kV AC powered trains, which enter the station on the line from Samedan, use tracks 1 to 3, while the 1,000 V DC powered Bernina trains use tracks 3 to 7. Track 3 has a catenary that can be switched from alternating current to direct current, and a special signal to display to train crews the type of current being used. By means of track 3, the trains using the core network (from Samedan) and the Bernina line trains can use the same line, despite their differing electrification systems. On track 3 is also the exchange of locomotives for the famous Bernina Express, which operates between Chur or Davos Platz and Tirano. At \\"Montebello Curve\\" railway crossing The line now turns to the south east. After crossing the Rosegbach, passing through the Surovas station (which was previously called \\"Sans Souci\\" (Carefree)), and crossing the Berninabach, it finally reaches Morteratsch station, about below the Morteratsch Glacier. Past the other end of the station is the world-famous Montebello Curve, where the line meets the road over the pass. The line and the road will now accompany each other as far as Ospizio Bernina. At the recently modernised Bernina Suot passing loop, the tree line has already been reached. The next stations are Diavolezza and Bernina Lagalb; both are departure points of cableways. The next section is probably the most interesting on the north side of the pass. Here, the route is very winding, and moves from one side of the valley to the other. First, the Berninabach is crossed, using the long Lower Berninabach Bridge, and then the line crosses the Arlasbach, a tributary of the Berninabach. On the Upper Berninabach Bridge, the line moves back to the eastern side of the valley. Southwest of here, the Piz Bernina and the Piz Pal√º rise majestically. Next follows the long Arlas Gallery, which provides protection against snow drifts. On the southwestern side are the small lakes known as Lej Pitschen and Lej Nair. Directly behind them towers the high and long Lago Bianco dam, which also marks the watershed between the Danube and the Po. The railway now runs along the eastern bank of the lake, and, near Ospizio Bernina, reaches its highest point, at above sea level. The Bernina Railway is thereby (mountainside railways excluded) the highest railway line in the Alps, operating as a public railway with year-round traffic. As the section from here to Poschiavo is particularly badly affected by drifting snow, countless engineering structures have been erected from the southern dam wall onwards: the long Scala Gallery, the long Scala Tunnel, the Sassal Mason Gallery, even longer at , and the long Drago Tunnel. After the Gr√ºm Gallery, the attractive Alp Gr√ºm station is reached. It not only is located at the tree line, but also marks the last station before the Italian linguistic border. From here onwards, the line clambers, with a gradient of up to 7%, and via multiple s-bends, downwards into the Poschiavo valley. That this occurs without the assistance of a rack railway system makes the Bernina Railway one of the steepest adhesion railways in the world. Immediately behind the Alp Gr√ºm station, the line winds in a tight 180¬∞ bend, and passes below Alp Gr√ºm through the Upper Pal√º Gallery. In a further 180¬∞ bend, it heads through the Pal√º Tunnel and subsequently through the Lower Pal√º Gallery. A further four half circle loops follow, until the line reaches the Cavaglia station. Since about 2000, there has also been a new automatic passing loop, Stablini, between Alp Gr√ºm and Cavaglia. It bisects a portion of the line that was previously prone to traffic delays. In zigzag fashion, the line continues from Cavaglia further down into the valley via Cadera to Privilasco. From there, the line leaves the tight bends behind, and, still at its maximum gradient, reaches the Poschiavo Valley. In Poschiavo it finally meets up once again with the Bernina Pass road. At the request of the Poschiavo community, the station at Poschiavo was built just outside the village boundaries. It has a railway depot and workshop, in which a few historic railcars of the Bernina Railway are also stored. The remaining section of line of approximately to Tirano are laid partially still as a mountain railway, but also partially in the manner of a tramway system. After the stopping point Li Curt, erected only in 1977, the line ends on a street in the village of Le Prese. Between Le Prese and Miralago the line passes along the banks of the Poschiavo Lake, thus remaining at the lake's altitude of above sea level. Brusio spiral viaduct Slope diagram of the Bernina Railway Below Brusio, the railway has, as its last highlight, the Brusio spiral viaduct, which serves only to adjust the altitude of the line. The spiral viaduct is followed by the stopping point for the village of Campascio, which still belongs to Brusio. Beyond the border station of Campocologno, which is unusually large due to its customs facilities, the line finally reaches Italy, and, after crossing the main square of Tirano, its terminal station. Here, the Bernina Railway meets the standard gauge station and line of the Italian state rail infrastructure company Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI), which links Tirano through Valtellina to Milan.  Rolling stock and traffic  Today, the following classes of railcar and locomotive are used in scheduled commercial services on the Bernina Railway: fifteen ABe 8/12I starting service in 2010, to replace the old series of engines, such as four ABe 4/4I and nine ABe 4/4II. Still in service also six ABe 4/4III and two Gem 4/4 that can operate without electrical feeding, thanks their diesel- generator inside (double engine locomotives). This fleet, consisting of railcars, also carries freight traffic. Some freight cars are added to passenger trains until the maximum towing capacity of such trains of 140 tonnes is reached. For reasons of safety, due to the presence of dangerous goods, other freight cars are operated in pure freight trains. Despite being set up originally only for tourist traffic, the Bernina Railway now also assists trade with Italy by carrying considerable quantities of freight, consisting mostly of heating oil, fuels and timber. Additionally, the regional shopping businesses of the Poschiavo valley are served partly by rail. The timetable is tightly designed, with year-round services of one passenger train per hour in each direction. The flagship services are the now fully panorama car equipped Bernina Express and the Trenino Rosso travelling in the opposite direction. In winter, an old 1913 steam rotary snowplow is regularly in service, but also two electrical rotary snowplows from 1968 and also two modern engines from 2010 are used as well. Their operation is also a tourist attraction that draws in railway enthusiasts from all over the world, especially for the steam one. The two Gem 4/4 assure the shunt of the rotary snowplow. In connection with the danger of avalanches on the Bernina Railway, the Rhaetian Railway has developed an unusual procedure for the removal of these high alpine hazards. In late winter, when the risk of avalanche is greatest, artillery is fired at the points of origin of avalanches, to bring some control to their occurrence.

They were founded in 2006 and are currently signed to Krian Music Group.  History  Vocalist and founder Lief Liebmann and bassist Collin Boyle began a dubious kinship, starting out as members of opposing groups. After becoming friends and eventually bandmates, they began practicing together starting as early as eighth grade. Drummer Christopher LoPorto was discovered through the New Jersey music scene, and the trio came together in 2006 as Blind and Driving, before changing their name to A Love Like Pi. After performing at the Bamboozle 2008 Festival and touring along the east coast and South by Southwest music conference, Thriving Records took them on and they began recording their first studio album, a self-titled demo EP. It was released on February 17, 2009. Their first full-length album, The Atlas and the Oyster, was released on March 24, 2009, and received overall positive reviews. BringOnMixedReviews.com says of the Atlas and the Oyster, \\"Pi (theoretically) goes on forever, and despite only a few quirky things I can nitpick about, so does my praise of this record.\\" A Love Like Pi toured the US with Years Gone By and Learning Takes a Lifetime, including participating in the Where the Wild Things Are Tour, and have announced plans to tour with Floral Terrace, Asteria, Gabriel the Marine, and Theatre Breaks Loose among others. On November 11, 2014, the band released an unexpected follow up to their debut album, an EP titled Jack and The Giant through Krian Music Group. The band is currently based in New York City, NY, and their EP is available on iTunes. The album was reviewed on Absolutepunk.net citing enthusiasm and production as strong points. Following the EP release, the band announced via their Facebook page that they were releasing a full-length album entitled \\"III\\" after the three stages of life, boy, man, and death. The album is available for pre- order on iTunes and is expected to be released September 18, 2015. It features 3 tracks from the Jack and the Giant EP, 1 previously unreleased track (\\"This is What You Get\\" now titled \\"Living Honestly\\"), and 6 brand new songs featuring a more atmospheric, relaxed, and organic feel than previous tracks.

(AMEX:GSB) is a software developer headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, USA. History Globalscape was founded in 1996 as a wholly owned subsidiary of American Telesource Incorporated (ATSI). The firm's original product released in 1996 was CuteFTP, an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client application for Windows and Mac platforms which continues today. The company has since diversified its offering to include secure information exchange solutions for consumer and enterprise customers. Today, approximately 80% of its revenue is derived from its enterprise software product line. These lines include products in the managed file transfer (MFT), information security (InfoSec), enterprise mobility management (EMM), and identity access management (IAM), and Software as a Service (SaaS) categories. IDC, Gartner and Aberdeen Group have published reports on these products .Gopal, Chandana & Fleming, Maureen: \\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P21546\\", IDC.Kenney, LF et al.: \\"Magic Quadrant for Managed File Transfer\\", Gartner Research Publication ID Number G00170848, 18 September 2009.

The firm also offers file synchronization and sharing services and products or FSS, which utilizes data replication and continuous data protection software for real-time enterprise collaboration file sharing and backups. In 2000, Globalscape made a brief foray into P2P file-sharing by releasing CuteMX. CuteMX was a program that was similar to Napster but was discontinued in July 2000. Globalscape's first cloud offering is called Managed Information Xchange or MIX. Sales and distribution partners include numerous technology distributors, such as Ingram Micro, MAPS of Mexico, and Lifeboat Distribution, and since early 2014 has pursued the North American channel distribution and re-seller market. Globalscape is member since 2007 of the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), which publishes the PCI Data Security Standards, the last of which is PCI DSS 3.0. On May 16, 2016 James Bindseil announced his resignation following a very low first-quarter earnings report compared to 2015's earnings. Matt Goulet was announced as CEO and president effective immediately. Goulet was CEO until April 2019 when he passed way unexpectedly. Robert Alpert, Chairman of the Board, was later named Interim CEO. Globalscape launched a new cloud-based MFT offering, EFT Arcus, in January 2018. In 2019 CIO Bulletin named Globalscape one of the 30 Most Valuable Companies to Watch in 2019, siting the firm's high performance in secure data exchange solutions. Also that year, CV Magazine names Globalscape Best Enterprise File Transfer Solutions Provider - 2019 as part of its 2019 Corporate Excellence Awards.  Partnerships  Globalscape's Tappin was used by Seagate on several different network attached storage lines, labeled as Seagate Global Access.

The Norwegian Maritime Museum is situated near several other museums, including the Fram Museum; the Kon- Tiki Museum; the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History; and the Viking Ship Museum. The Norwegian Maritime Museum is operated in conjunction with Norwegian Folk Museum. Overview The museum was founded in 1914 and previously known as the Norsk Sj√∏fartsmuseum. The exhibits on coast culture and maritime history cover a number of subjects including ship building, boat models, fishing, marine archeology, and shipping. The video \\"Maritime Norway\\" by Ivo Caprino and a library are also a part of the museum experience. Additionally the museum has a marine archaeological department. The museum also displays a collection of more than 40 maritime paintings by notable artists. Ships The Stavanger and the Svanen are on display. The Stavanger was designed by Colin Archer for the Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue. The three-masted schooner Svanen was built during the winter of 1915-1916 and saw service with the Norwegian merchant fleet. From 1972, the Gj√∏a was displayed in the Norwegian Maritime Museum. The ship was the first vessel to transit the Northwest Passage in the 1903-06 Arctic expedition of Roald Amundsen. In 2009, the Norwegian Maritime Museum and the Fram Museum signed an agreement for the Fram Museum to take over the exhibition of the Gj√∏a. It is currently displayed in a separate building at Fram Museum. Past directors * Gunnar Isachsen * Kristian Kielland * Svein Molaug * Per G.

The fight took place following the defeat of Major William Ormsby at the First Battle of Pyramid Lake as U.S. Volunteers entered the war. Battle When Major William Ormsby's vigilante command was routed at Pyramid Lake, settlers in the area sent calls for help to California. John C. Hays responded to the call and arrived in Carson City to organize a volunteer regiment. Hays organized over 500 men from Carson City, Virginia City, Genoa and other communities into the \\"Washoe Regiment\\". U.S. Regular soldiers from Fort Alcatraz where en route to the region under Captain Joseph Stewart. Instead of waiting for Stewart's regulars, Hays marched his command out of Carson City toward the location of the initial Indian attack at Williams Station. Hays encountered 150 Paiute warriors at the station and a brief skirmish ensued. Two soldiers and six Paiutes were killed. The warriors withdrew toward Pyramid Lake and were defeated in the Second Battle of Pyramid Lake. Williams Station Williams Station was a Pony Express station kept by James O. Sullivan along the Carson River between stations 149 (in the Carson Sink) and 151 (Hooten Wells Station). The ruins were inundated by the Lahontan Reservoir created by the 1911 Lahontan Dam and were visible during a 1992 drought.

Asimov himself declared his coined word to be uneuphonious (not pleasant to the ear), and defined it as being a portmanteau of the two words \\"space home\\". Definition Asimov described how energy flows through a life-support system from a low entropic state from which it moves all material resources, such as air, water, and food with the rejection of low-grade heat as the final energy output. The concept reflects the dynamics of ecosystem ecology as described by Howard T. Odum. The term applies to any life-support system from submarines to spaceships, and includes the operation of the Earth's own biosphere. The word \\"spome\\" was also referenced in a reprint of Asimov's original article in Is Anyone There? 1967 by Doubleday, Ash.Isaac Asimov bibliography He surmised that an asteroid could be \\"spomified\\" by being hollowed out and equipped suitably for long term, sustainable flight.M.

Cal Expo is governed by an appointed 11-member Board of Directors and daily operations are managed by the chief executive officer (selected by the Board). During the annual California State Fair more than 2,000 seasonal temporary employees are hired. The California Exposition is a self-sufficient operation that receives no government funding but still has an estimated economic impact of more than $250 million on the region. History The California legislature created the State Agricultural Society to promote California's reputation for farming and industry. An agricultural exposition was organized and held in San Francisco in 1854, and California Historic Landmark #861 marks the site. Given that travel was difficult in that era, the next several annual expositions were moved around the state, to Sacramento, San Jose, Stockton, and Marysville. In 1859 the exposition returned to Sacramento, and it was decided that a permanent site should be found. Capitol Park, a six block site bounded by E, H, 20th and 22nd Streets () was purchased and was home to the state fair for the next fifty years. Growth in population and attendance forced the purchase of just outside the city limits on Stockton Boulevard (), and the first fair was held there in 1909. But World War I interrupted the fair in 1917‚Äì18. Continued growth caused that site to be expanded by in 1937. During and after World War II, from 1942 to 1947, the Fair was suspended and the fairgrounds were occupied by the Army. During its formative years (1929-1942?), the California Highway Patrol used some of the State Fair facilities as an unofficial \\"training academy\\", later using other state-owned areas in the Sacramento area for training use until the current CHP Academy was opened in 1976. In 1948, the state purchased approximately 900 acres of undeveloped land along the American River north of downtown Sacramento. Funds were not allocated to begin construction on this land until 1963, and the State Fair continued at the Stockton Boulevard grounds until 1967. The California Exposition was dedicated on Monday, May 22, 1967. Governor Ronald Reagan delivered the dedicatory address at the 630 acre sit on the American River. Then in 1968, Governor Ronald Reagan opened the new \\"Cal Expo\\" site, which covers over of developed land at . Cal Expo has seen limited changes over the years. Following the tragic attacks of 9/11, a memorial plaza was installed in 2002. In 2012, the Disneyland Resort donated to Cal Expo the iconic 'CALIFORNIA' letters that previously stood in front of Disney California Adventure from its 2001 opening until 2011. The letters now stand at the entrance to the Expo. In addition to the annual State Fair, Cal Expo hosts a number of other community, trade and business events, including the annual State Fair Gala (supporting scholarships), Sacramento County Fair, International Sportsman Expo, Western States Horse Expo and a number of other RV, auto and special collectible trade shows. The one-mile dirt racetrack at Cal Expo hosts live thoroughbred racing during the annual State Fair and live harness racing (September through May), in addition to special events like the Sacramento Mile Auto-race. The old California State Fairgrounds Race Track hosted USAC National Championship races. The fair won't be held in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic was to blame; the 159th was deferred to 2021. California State Fair =Features= Monorail Cal Expo is home to one of two operating permanent monorail system in California - the only other can be found at Disneyland. The iconic monorail was installed during the creation of its existing grounds in 1968 by Universal Mobility Incorporated. The Monorail ride is only open for public use during the annual State Fair and is a great way to see the grounds from above. The storage facility for the monorail trams are located in the northwest corner of the grounds. Each tram features a different California symbol, like the California Golden Poppy or California Quail.

Background In 1859, the news broke that silver had been found in the huge Comstock Lode in Washoe, a region that was then in the western part of Utah Territory, and that would soon become the territory of Nevada. Hordes of miners flooded to the mining center of Virginia City, near to Carson City. They cut down pinyon trees to make fuel for ore-processing, destroying the pine-nut \\"orchards\\" that were essential to the Paiute food economy. Hunters and trappers took big game, fish, and waterfowl to feed the miners. Ranchers moved into the fertile valleys, cutting off access to places where nuts, roots, and seeds could be gathered. The Paiutes and their allies, the Bannocks and Shoshones, gathered at Pyramid Lake towards the end of April 1860 for a conference on how to deal with the encroachments of the white men. Most of the leaders spoke out for war. Chief Winnemucca (Poito), the most senior leader at the assembly, appeared to be in favor of war, but refrained from taking a public position. Numaga was the only chief who spoke in favor of peace. He agreed that the white men had greatly wronged the Indians, but pointed out that given their numbers and resources, the whites would be bound to win any war. While Numaga was speaking, a group of Indians arrived and brought news of an incident that had just happened at Williams Station. Mogoannoga, a mixed-race Bannock warrior, had led a raiding party to attack a Pony Express station called Williams Station, on the Carson River near present-day Lake Lahontan. One version says the raid was an unprovoked attack to provoke war. Another says the raiders had heard that men at the station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out when they went to investigate and free the women. Either way, the war party killed five Americans. After hearing what had taken place, Numaga said, \\"There is no longer any use for counsel; we must prepare for war, for the soldiers will now come here to fight us.\\" Battle William Ormsby assembled 105 militia from Virginia City, Gold Hill, Carson City, and Genoa to rescue the station and punish the Paiute war party. Ormsby, an experienced military veteran, rallied the citizens of Virginia City. After forming, the assembled delegates appointed a militia jury, which quickly commissioned Ormsby as a captain of militia. With his small platoon, Ormsby marched to Gold Hill, Nevada, Carson City, Nevada, and Genoa, Nevada, where they recruited further militia. In the preceding period, William Ormsby had become friendly with many important Paiute leaders, including Chief Truckee. At the time, Ormsby was supervising the education of Sarah Winnemucca, daughter of a chief. Given his military and political background, the militia force, now numbering 105 men, elected William Ormsby as their major under the laws of the militia. Ormsby marched to Williams Station, gave a Christian burial to the mutilated and dead men, and continued north to Pyramid Lake following the Truckee River. On 12 May 1860, Ormsby sent out a scouting party led by Captain Archie McDonald. This party saw two Indians and were chasing after them when a much larger group of Indians appeared. The scouts fled back to the main body. They were not pursued. Ormsby's force was in a tight spot, strung out along the river with a bluff on one side and a cliff on the other. Numaga let about 100 warriors show themselves, drawing Ormsby's fire, then a larger group appeared and advanced against the white men. Ormsby also advanced, uphill and dazzled by the late afternoon sun, into fire from the Indians. Seeing other Indians circling in his rear, Ormsby ordered a retreat. The white volunteers tried to take a stand in a gulch near some cottonwoods, but were pursued by the Indians, and found themselves under fire from other Indians stationed in the cottonwoods. The white men had expected the Indians to only have bows and arrows, and were armed with handguns. They found that the Indians were well-armed with rifles, with much greater range and accuracy, and they were surrounded. Some tried to escape across the river, but it was flowing too fast with the spring runoff. Others tried to escape uphill. With the battle won, Numaga tried to stop further killing, but his warriors' blood was up. Ormsby was killed, and 76 of the militiamen died in total. Most of the remaining 29 survivors were wounded, and were saved only by the cover of darkness. They hid until the Indians had left, then made their way back to Buckland's station. Aftermath Because of these attacks, the settlers called for help. John C. Hays, noted former Texas Ranger, went to Carson City to organize and train a volunteer army regiment.

WMS-IV is made up of seven subtests: Spatial Addition, Symbol Span, Design Memory, General Cognitive Screener, Logical Memory (I & II), Verbal Paired Associates (I & II), and Visual Reproduction (I & II). A person's performance is reported as five Index Scores: Auditory Memory, Visual Memory, Visual Working Memory, Immediate Memory, and Delayed Memory.

This may include conditions such as dementias or mild learning difficulties. There is clear evidence that the WMS differentiates clinical groups (such as those with dementias or neurological disorders) from those with normal memory functioning and that the primary index scores can distinguish among the memory-impaired clinical groups.Hunsley, J., and C.

The children of El Sayyid Nosair, who was convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the killing of Meir Kahane, attended the school until 1989.

Ousmane Mey was appointed as Federal Inspector of Administration for the North Province in 1968.Les √âlites africaines (1970), page 243 . He was part of the small circle of Ahidjo's associates who crafted the 1972 constitution providing for a unitary state, and he was responsible for typing the initial draft.Victor Julius Ngoh, Cameroon: From Federal to Unitary State, 1961-1972 (2004), page 176. When the unitary state was established, Mey was appointed as Governor of North Province by Ahidjo in 1972. Described as \\"the immovable governor\\", he was entrusted with maintaining firm control over Ahidjo's native region and primary support base, and he strongly favored the appointment of members of the Fulbe ethnic group to administrative posts in the province. At that time the North Province encompassed the whole of northern Cameroon; its disproportionately large size and unified administration under a close ally of Ahidjo was an important factor in the stability and preservation of the Ahidjo regime, providing a secure base for Ahidjo's political power.Jean-Fran√ßois Bayart, \\"Cameroon\\", in Contemporary West African States (1989), ed. Donal B. Cruise O'Brien, John Dunn, and Richard Rathbone, Cambridge University Press, page 35. In an entirely unanticipated move, President Ahidjo announced his resignation on 4 November 1982 and was succeeded by Paul Biya, a southerner, two days later.Piet Konings, \\"The Post-Colonial State and Economic and Political Reforms in Cameroon\\", in Liberalization in the Developing World: Institutional and Economic Changes in Latin America, Africa and Asia (1996), ed. Alex E. Fern√°ndez Jilberto and Andr√© Mommen, Routledge, pages 250-252. Although Ahidjo voluntarily transferred power to Biya, a power struggle soon developed between the two, and Biya acted to weaken Ahidjo by splitting his key support base, the North Province, into three smaller provinces: North Province, Adamawa Province, and Far North Province. For Biya, the severity of the power struggle ultimately necessitated the removal of Ahidjo loyalists from important administrative positions, and the political influence of northerners was radically reduced as Biya worked to consolidate his power. Mey was dismissed from his post as Governor of North Province by Biya on 22 August 1983; his dismissal was concurrent with Biya's announcement of an alleged coup plot organized by Ahidjo and a purge of Ahidjo loyalists from the government.Joseph Takougang and Milton Krieger, African State and Society in the 1990s: Cameroon's Political Crossroads (2000), pages 70-71. Although key Ahidjo loyalists were removed from office during the power struggle, President Biya later restored some of them to administrative posts.

C. Andersens Boulevard to Amagerside Amager Boulevard. It is one of only two bridges to carry motor vehicles across the harbour in central Copenhagen, the other being Knippelsbro. History =1690: The first Langebro= Christian's Church Completed in 1690, the first bridge located roughly where Langebro is today was known as Kalvebodbro (Kalvebod Bridge) and connected the Western Rampart's Rysensteen Bastion on Zealand with Christianshavn Rampart's Christianshavns Vold#Kalvebod Bastion on Christianshavn. It was a wooden structure with a drawbridge in the middle that allowed ships to pass. The bridge was built for the military but was also open to civilian pedestrians. The bridge was refurbished several times. It was widened in 1875-76. =1903: The Swing Bridge= The swing bridge in 1923 with Amager Boulevard in the bottom right corner Plans for a new Langebro were first presented in 1885 but not realized until 1903. The new bridge was located 400 ft to the south of the old one, Vestre Boulevard (now H. C. Andersens Boulevard) and connected to the Amager Boulevard on the other side of the harbor. It was a swing bridge resting on nine stone pillars. The swing bridge was both used for both trams and the Amagerbanen railroad. =1939: The temporary bridge= With growing automobile traffic, the new bridge soon became outdated and a new temporary bridge was constructed in 1930. The bridge was subject to sabotage on 23 March 1945. =1954= Langebro today. In direction towards Amager. The temporary bridge was replaced by the current Langebro in 1954. Cultural references * S√∏ren Kierkegaard's pseudonymous author, Hilarius Bookbinder, mentions the bridge in Stages on Life's Way (1845): \\"Langebro [Long Bridge] has its name from its length; that is, as a bridge it is long but is not much as a roadway, as one easily finds out by passing over it. Then when one is standing on the other side in Christianshavn, it in turn seems that the bridge must nevertheless be long, because one is far, very far away from Copenhagen.\\" (Stages on Life's Way p. 259) * Langebro is a play by Hans Christian Andersen, named for the bridge in Copenhagen. * The Danish-American 1961 giant monster film Reptilicusincludes Scenes from a panic-stricken Langebro are featured in. * Langebro is seen in many of the Olsen-banden films, including The Olsen Gang, The Olsen Gang in a Fix (1:14:47) and The Olsen Gang on the Track (1:29:16). * \\"Langebro\\" is the name of Gasolin's 1971 adaption of Joan Baez's version of Geordie, where the setting is shifted from London to Copenhagen and Langebro takes the place of London Bridge.

French forces under the command of Marshal Fran√ßois de Franquetot de Coigny were defeated in an attempt to dislodge imperial troops under the command of Friedrich Heinrich von Seckendorff. The battle was one of the last significant engagements between the combatants in the War of the Polish Succession. Background The 1734 campaign season in the Rhine valley theater of the War of the Polish Succession closed with France controlling the west bank of the Rhine River as far north as Mainz, and the forces of the Habsburgs in strong defensive positions on the east bank. In November 1734 the belligerents had begun diplomatic overtures at peace, mediated by the neutral British and Dutch to bring an end to the conflict. Despite these talks, hostilities resumed in 1735, principally in northern Italy, where Spain, allied to France, harboured further territorial ambitions. In the Rhine valley, French troops under the command of Marshal Coigny moved from winter quarters to more aggressive stances along the Rhine during the spring and summer, but were unwilling to test the Habsburg defences, which were under the overall command of the ageing Prince Eugene of Savoy. The Germans were reinforced in August 1735 by more than 10,000 Russian troops led by Peter Lascy, the first time Russian troops reached the Rhine. Eugene was summoned to Vienna in September to participate in peace talks, leaving command of the German troops with the Duke of W√ºrttemberg. Reichsgraf Friedrich Heinrich von Seckendorff, in command of the German right at Mainz, received permission from W√ºrttemberg to move against the French left in an attempt to push them back toward Trier and gain territory between the Maas and Moselle Rivers. Prelude On 20 September Seckendorff's chosen forces began crossing the Rhine, moving toward the Moselle. He commanded a total of 41 battalions with an effective strength of about 35,000 men. On the same day, Marshal Belle-Isle, commanding the French left, coincidentally left Kaiserslautern with a sizable detachment that was to be stationed at Trier to forage for provisions. Arriving there on the 27th, Belle-Isle left it under the command of the Comte de B√©thune. Upon his return to French headquarters at Bad D√ºrkheim on the 29th, he learned of Seckendorff's movement. He ordered 12 battalions from the reserve stationed there toward Trier, with an additional nine to follow from the main army at Oggersheim. On 6 October the reserves reached Trier, with the nine arriving the next day. These raised the French force at Trier to 29 battalions of infantry with 66 cavalry squadrons, although the force was hampered somewhat by a shortage of provisions. Belle-Isle immediately began moving troops forward, adopting a defensive line along the Ruwer south of the Moselle. He also sent a detachment under the Marquis de Mouchy northeast toward Lieser on reconnaissance, and on the 10th sent another 1,000 men under Lutteaux to reinforce Mouchy. Marshal Coigny Seckendorff reached Stromberg on the 5th, and was marching for Simmern the next day when an advance company of Hungarian cavalry encountered a detachment of French dragoons near Kirchberg. The Germans sent more troops forward, and after a brief skirmish, captured most of the French force. By the 8th the Germans had occupied Trarbach, which they intended as the site of a supply depot. While waiting for supplies, Seckendorff investigated the French position at Liesern, interpreting it as French intent to dispute potential crossings of the Moselle at that point. He ordered troops on his left to advance further west, reaching as far as Gr√§fendhron and threatening to cut off Mouchy's supply and communications, while the main body advanced toward Monzelfeld, southeast of Liesern. Seckendorff then took a detachment on 15 October to determine if Klausen (west of Trarbach on the north side of the Moselle) was occupied by the French. Finding it unoccupied, he left a company of 40 hussars at the abbey. The next day a French detachment (25 companies of infantry and 800 cavalry) assaulted the abbey and chose to retreat when German reinforcements from Wittlich arrived. Seckendorff then ordered Baron Stein's entire brigade, including 300 recently arrived Illyrian troops, to Klausen. Delays in the forwarding of provisions from supply depots on the Rhine then forced Seckendorff to halt his advance. However, his advance was sufficient to prompt Mouchy's retreat from Liesern, and Seckendorff was then able to establish a pontoon bridge there. On 11 October Marshal Coigny decided that he should come to Belle-Isle's support. Leaving his headquarters on the Rhine, he began moving larger parts of his army toward Kaiserslautern and Trier. Advance units of this movement began reaching Trier on the 17th, and Belle-Isle decided to move forward. On 19 October he crossed the Moselle just below Trier and camped on the north bank of the Moselle. Seckendorff, whose army had begun crossing at Liesern on the 18th, was informed of this movement. Although he had planned to establish a camp at Osann, this news prompted him to change his plans. Late on 19 October, he issued orders that the infantry of Georg of Hessen, and his left wing's cavalry, should cross the Moselle at 4:00 am and march to Klausen. These troops, crossing at Liesern and Bernkastel, were expected to arrive in Klausen around noon. Battle Marshal Coigny ordered his troops out early on 20 October. The troops marched north to Hetzerath, where they turned east and marched through a narrow defile to reach the Salm between Esch and Rivenich, just west of Klausen. Their approach was observed by Seckendorff, who had also risen early and rode west on reconnaissance. As the French forces came out of the defile and into the river valley, Coigny directed his left, 36 companies of grenadiers under Phelippes upstream toward Esch. It was followed by Belle- Isle's troops, 33 infantry battalions and 68 cavalry squadrons, then 17 infantry battalions and 40 cavalry squadrons from Coigny's Rhine army, which bore off to the right to take the heights above Rivenich. Reichsgraf Friedrich Heinrich von Seckendorff Seckendorff had ordered some of his Hungarian cavalry to engage the French vanguard when he first spotted them. This they did around 11:00 am, but were driven back. As it became clear that the bulk of the French army was coming, he sent 10 companies of grenadiers to hold the bridge at Rivenich, also sending 20 cavalry squadrons from the right to support the left. As these movements were taking place, the supporting infantry began to arrive on the heights above Klausen. Around 2:00 pm the French columns arrived on the heights above Esch and Rivenich. Coigny ordered Brigadier Rieux, commanding the right, to secure the bridge at Rivenich, and ordered Phelippes, on his left, to secure Esch. The outnumbered imperial forces holding the bridge at Rivenich gave way, and the French gained control of the bridge but did not immediately begin crossing in force. Seckendorff ordered 5 companies of grenadiers to reinforce those already on his left. The French troops moving toward Esch were slowed by difficult terrain. Seckendorff deployed two cannon to the south of Esch, further complicating the French advance on that front. With most of his forces arrived by 4:00 pm, Seckendorff decided to retake the bridge at Rivenich, while the two army centers engaged in an artillery battle across the Salm. For the taking of the crossing, Seckendorff sent 6 more grenadier companies, 3 battalions of Danish infantry, 1 Pomeranian battalion, and some Hungarian cavalry down toward Rivenich. Coigny, observing that his right would be outnumbered by this force, withdrew his troops from the bridge and abandoned Rivenich. Seckendorff seized the momentum, and sent his force across the river to attack Coigny's flank, while also sending several companies of cavalry across the river near Esch to attack the French left. The French infantry fired volleys of musket fire against the oncoming cavalry and then began to fall back toward the center. It soon became dark, and the combatants disengaged. Aftermath The imperial infantry suffered 22 killed and 76 wounded, while its cavalry lost 23 men and 40 horses killed, with 17 each wounded, as well as 3 men and 7 horses missing. The French lost 200 men killed or wounded. Marshal Coigny, after inspecting Seckendorff's position, decided that it was too strong to assault, and retreated the next day to Hetzerath. Seckendorff sent Baron Diemar with the Hungarian and German cavalry to harry the French rear. French discipline, however, was tight, and the imperials garnered only a few supply wagons and horses. Coigny was prompted to retreat further by reports of a movement against his left flank near F√∂hren; this was only an imperial supply caravan bringing provisions to Seckendorff from Luxembourg. A significant shortage of provisions forced Coigny to divide his troops on either side of the Moselle, a risky move with his enemy close by. Seckendorff's manoeuvres did not capitalise on this, but Coigny had, except for a few pockets, completely withdrawn from the north side of the Moselle by 28 October. On 31 October Coigny learned that a cease-fire had been negotiated as part of the ongoing peace talks; this news was delivered to Seckendorff on 12 November.

Korean Publishers Cooperative  Major business  = Book distribution = The publishing industry is suffering from the ever-increasing shortage of warehouse space, distribution facilities and workforce. To protect member companies from such difficulties, the Korean Publishers Cooperativeformed a unified supply system for the joint storage, delivery and marketing. All books published by member companies are distributed to all bookstores in the nation only through the cooperative. The unified supply system allows member companies to concentrate on only publication planning, which in turn allows the supply of books to readers, helping create higher earnings. Furthermore, books are also supplied to bookstores doing business with the nationwide cooperatives in addition to the direct-dealing of books of the member companies through general distribution services. In 2008, the cooperative signed an MOU with the Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation to operate seven Happy Bookstores in subway lines 5, 6, 7 and 8. Approximately 20 more bookstores will be opened in the future.Korean Publishers Cooperative = Book delivery = The cooperative has supplied books ordered by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism for the past seven years. This experience enables the cooperative to supply books needed by the state and public university libraries, schools, government offices, enterprises and research institutes.

To help librarians, the cooperative puts new book catalogs in the cooperative Home Page on a daily basis. The cooperative has built MARC Data and supplied them to all libraries operating in the nation, maintaining a more than 95% delivery rate by collecting books based on the order catalogs. = Credit Extension = Using the funds raised through contributions and loans, the cooperative makes monetary grants to members so they may publish books and build a solid foundation for the publishing and culture business. = Joint purchases = To reduce publishing companies‚Äô expenses, the cooperative operates a coop paper purchasing and distribution program and a PR program where information on new publications and weekly/monthly bestsellers is provided.

Fincham was born in London; his father (Jonathan George Fincham) and grandfather were both organ builders and so it is not surprising he practised this trade himself. He was apprenticed in 1842‚Äì49 to the London organ builder Henry Bevington, and then worked as a foreman for James Bishop & Son. Fincham emigrated to Australia in 1852 and started working as an organ tuner and repairer 113 Queen Street in Melbourne. In 1853 he went to the diggings at Ballarat. He returned to Melbourne in 1854 and worked as a builder on the Spencer Street railway station. Within ten years of his arrival in Australia he had raised sufficient funds to equip a workshop and buy stock to begin organ building as George Fincham & Sons. Also by this time churches had funds for pipe organs and interest in organ music was growing, helped by the arrival of organists such as Charles Horsley, David Lee and the Revd George Torrance in Australia. The organ building business grew and by 1904 he had a branches in Adelaide and Sydney, and agents in Perth and Brisbane. Altogether he built about 200 organs for cathedrals and churches and supplied pipe work and parts to organ builders throughout Australasia. His integrity and the quality of the organs he built overcame the prejudice towards colonial work. He was outstanding among Australian organ builders for his skill, his business ability and his readiness to keep pace with modern trends. He patented many improvements; most of the organs he built had mechanical action and from 1886 some had tubular-pneumatic. Fincham died in Melbourne in 1910. His company, continued by his sons and grandsons, completed many projects in more than a century of organ building. It closed down in February 2006.  Notable organs  The organ at St Mary Star of the Sea, West Melbourne Robert J Haddon 1906 for George Fincham Organ at Malvern Presbyterian Church, Melbourne His notable instruments include: * Intercolonial Exhibition of Australasia (built by Fincham in 1866). * Royal Exhibition Building, Melbourne (built by Fincham in 1880) - considered his magnum opus. * St Francis Xavier Catholic Church, Frankston (built by Fincham's son Leslie Fincham in 1927, and refurbished by his grandson George B.

In November 2009, federal prosecutors in the United States seized its assets.Adam Goldman, Associated Press. \\"Feds to seize 4 mosques, tower linked to Iran\\", November 12, 2009 The seized assets include bank accounts; Islamic centers consisting of schools and mosques in New York City, Maryland, California and Houston; more than in Virginia; and the Piaget Building, a 36-story glass office tower in New York. Without rent from the skyscraper, the Alavi Foundation would have almost no way to continue supporting the Islamic centers, which house schools and mosques. The most recent tax records show the foundation earned $4.5 million from rents in 2007. Legal scholars said they know of only a few cases in U.S. history in which law enforcement authorities have seized a house of worship. Marc Stern, a religious-liberty expert with the American Jewish Congress, called such cases extremely rare.

This is the vision of a world where every child has the opportunity to fulfil his potential. To achieve this goal, AMADE actively commits to the protection and blossoming of children throughout the world. AMADE's interventions around the world are founded on the Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) adopted by the United Nations in 1989, and the Millennium Declaration adopted in 2000 by the international community to fight against poverty. AMADE contributes to the implementation of these commitments through the following \\"missions\\": * To protect the most vulnerable children from violence, exploitation and abuse. * To promote children's development by contributing to access to education and health. * To accompany changes through plea initiatives. As a development charity, AMADE aims to offer perennial and innovative responses to the issues it is confronted with, giving priority to the strengthening of capacities and the self-sufficiency of beneficiaries. Though children may be its main preoccupation, AMADE's concern also includes the community. This includes fighting against gender inequalities and highlighting the importance of equal opportunities. To intervene in the name of children is a responsibility that requires expertise as well as moral and human values. It also requires the strongest transparency, not only regarding financial management, but also concerning the selection, follow-up and evaluation of projects.

In phylogenetics, saturation effects result in long branch attraction, where the most distant lineages have misleadingly short branch lengths. It also decreases phylogenetic information contained in the sequences. Genetic saturation occurs most rapidly on fast evolving sequences, such as the hypervariable region of mitochondrial DNA, or in Short tandem repeat such as on the Y-chromosome.
