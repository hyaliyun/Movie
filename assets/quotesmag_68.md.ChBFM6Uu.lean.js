It is one of the few highways in the state with an unpaved portion. Route description The western terminus is in Edgemont (in Caldwell County) at an intersection with Edgemont Road (SR 1420), Roseboro Road (Pisgah National Forest FR 981) and Edgemont Church Place (SR 1358). The first of the highway are quite curvy and unpaved. NC 90 enters Lenoir on Valway Road (SR 1352). The route then turns left onto N. Main Street to then overlap with US 321 on Blowing Rock Boulevard. NC 90 then turn left, after 2 miles, onto Wilkesboro Boulevard to overlap with US 64 and NC 18. After about 2 miles, the route then turns right onto Taylorsville Road, keeping and overlap with US 64. After 40 miles, going through Taylorsville, NC 90 ends at US 21/US 64 in Statesville. History Established in 1921 as an original state highway, it started at NC 50 (Person Street), in Raleigh, going east to Columbia. In 1927, NC 90 was extended west from Raleigh to Lenoir at NC 18. In 1929, NC 90 extended east from Columbia to Fort Landing. In 1932, US 64 was established and was overlapped on NC 90 from just west of Statesville to Fort Landing. In late 1934, NC 90 was removed from all overlap with US 64 east of Statesville; at same time, NC 90 was extended west from Lenoir to US 221 near Linville, replacing NC 171. Sometime between 1939‚Äì44, NC 90 was extended east back in Statesville to its current east terminus, replacing some of US 64 through the downtown area. At some point in the 1960s, NC 90 was truncated to its current west terminus in Edgemont, its former route to Linville moved under Pisgah National Forest management. In 2008, NC 90 was removed from downtown Lenoir, creating an overlap with US 321.

At the close of voting, it had received 12 points - all from Cyprus - placing 20th in a field of 25.

For their Eurovision appearance, Thalassa featured the female vocalist Dionysia Karoki, who wore an unusual, knee-length black dress. The song had a gentle verse, which exploded into the catchy chorus. The Greek entry caused a bit of controversy. The song's composer was not happy with the way the group's performance was to be filmed and demanded changes. When his demands were not met, the group threatened to quit the contest on the morning of the final day of rehearsals, and on the afternoon, they pulled out. Only minutes after their withdrawal, however, the group returned to the green room, having decided to go through with the performance after all, without the composer attending them on the scene. The song's composer, Yiannis Valvis, was not permitted to attend the contest in general, on account of the number of aggressive tantrums he had had when things were not going his way. With the rapid expansion of the Contest, the decision was taken to restrict entry to those countries which had performed better over the previous 5 years, a group which did not include Greece. Thus, Greece was not invited to the 1999 Contest. Neither did they enter the 2000 Contest.

He is considered as a revolutionary icon in the history of 20th century Persian music. Ali-Naqi Vaziri (also known as Colonel Vaziri) is one of the seven children of Musa Khan Vaziri (a prominent official in the Persian Cossack Brigade) and Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi, a notable Iranian writer, satirist and one of the pioneering figures in the women's movement of Iran; her book Ma'ayeb al-Rejal (Failings of Men, also translated as Vices of Men) is considered by some as the first declaration of women's rights in the modern history of Iran. The celebrated artistic painter Hassan Ali Khan Vaziri is Ali-Naqi's brother. Ali-Naqi Vaziri was a master of Persian classical music so that he was able to play the tar in a style very reminiscent of that of Mirza Abdollah. He always looked for new dimensions and perspectives in musical expression, and by doing so he revolutionized the style of playing the tar. He was the first to transcribe the classical radif of the Persian music. Vaziri for years was the director of Tehran Conservatory of Music and a professor at the University of Tehran.

They subsequently released Welcome Back in 1994, remastered versions of the three early albums and Love Song: The Book of Love as a box set in 2010.  Background  Love Song was founded in 1970 by Chuck Girard, Tommy Coomes, Jay Truax, and Fred Field. Field was replaced by Bob Wall, who played guitar on all three albums. Drummer John Mehler, who had joined the fledgling group in its infancy, then left with Field, rejoined in time to play on Final Touch and Feel the Love. Another latter-day member was Phil Keaggy, who joined to replace departing Wall in 1973 but had already left the group before the recording of Final Touch and Feel the Love. They were a part of the Jesus movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, coming out of Chuck Smith's Calvary Chapel. Their classic debut album, Love Song (1972), is considered one of the greatest Christian music albums of all time.CCM Magazine The group toured heavily in the early 1970s, becoming very popular both in the US and abroad. By 1976, the Jesus Movement was being replaced by Christian Contemporary Music (CCM) as the leading style of Christian rock, and it was becoming more business than ministry. Many of the bands that had started the movement began to break up, and after a final \\"Reunion Tour\\" in 1976 which resulted in the Feel the Love double live album, Love Song was no more. Many of the original members continued with solo careers and a few are still performing today. In 1994, the band recorded another reunion album, Welcome Back which included new versions of the songs off the first three albums. Love Song has released a box-set containing their first three albums plus a DVD of their 1973 concert in San Antonio. All original tapes on all three projects (Love Song, Final Touch, and the live Feel the Love albums) have been re- mastered at Mastering Lab. Recording engineer Bill Schnee assisted Chuck Girard and Tommy Coomes in the work. The drum solo has been re-included in the live album, which will mark the first time that there has been a full digitally re-mastered version of that album. Love Song started a reunion tour in 2010 with Calvary Chapel founding Pastor Chuck Smith touring throughout the U.S. In 2017 the band played a two night appearance concert at The Upper a Room in Orange County, California. Those concerts were filmed with the intention of producing a live concert DVD. Through a series of circumstances that project turned into the production of a full-length documentary on this iconic band. Many notable people have contributed to this project. The working title is Love Song The Documentary: The story of \\"A Band That Changed Christian Music\\" and is due to be released at the end of 2020.

A term typically used by Earth scientists, a sabkha () is a coastal, supratidal mudflat or sandflat in which evaporite-saline minerals accumulate as the result of semiarid to arid climate. Sabkhas are gradational between land and intertidal zone within restricted coastal plains just above normal high-tide level. Within a sabkha, evaporite-saline minerals sediments typically accumulate below the surface of mudflats or sandflats. Evaporite-saline minerals, tidal-flood, and aeolian deposits characterize many sabkhas found along modern coastlines. The accepted type locality for a sabkha is at the southern coast of the Persian Gulf, in the United Arab Emirates.Neuendorf, K.K.E., J.P. Mehl, Jr., and J.A. Jackson, eds.

Springer Science & Business Media. Sabkha is a phonetic translation of the Arabic word used to describe any form of salt flat. A sabkha is also known as a sabkhah, sebkha, or coastal sabkha. The term sabkha has also been used as a general term for any flat area, coastal or interior, where, as the result of evaporation, salt and other evaporite minerals precipitate near or at the surface. The term continental sabkha is used for such environments found within deserts. Because of the confusion created by using sabkha for salt flats and playas, it has been proposed that the usage of this term be abandoned for playas and other intracontinental basins and flats.Briere, P.R., 2000. Playa, playa lake, sabkha: Proposed definitions for old terms. Journal of Arid Environments, 45(1), pp.1-7. Origin and development  The Abu Dhabi Sabkha  The origin and progression of coastal sabkha development at the southern shore of the Persian Gulf was first discussed in detail in the seminal paper by Evans et al. 1969. The southern shoreline of the Persian Gulf is a shallow, low-angle carbonate ramp characterised by an evaporitic supratidal system passing offshore, via a broad carbonate‚Äìevaporite intertidal environment, into a carbonate-dominated subtidal system. This is a low-energy setting with a small tidal range (1‚Äì2 m) and low wave energy as a result of the limited fetch. High rates of evaporation result in salinities of 45‚Äì46 g l‚àí1 along the open-marine coast of Abu Dhabi and up to 89 g l‚àí1 in more- restricted lagoons. The coast of Abu Dhabi is locally protected from open- marine conditions by a number of peninsulas and offshore shoals and islands associated with the east‚Äìwest trending Great Pearl Bank. Khor lagoon In the khor-lagoon-sabkha model, an initial rise in sea-level floods coastal areas and creates shallow water features. If the features silt up, or the land rises, or the sea level falls, then the trapped water evaporates, leaving a flat salt pan, or sabkha. If the coastal region has irregular topography, then the flooding creates large independent creeks, or khors. A khor is a shallow, subtidal flat or tidal inlet. The inlet may host grey mangroves, depending on whether less saline water is available from wadis or groundwater. As sediment begins to accumulate, the khors become more shallow and form a lagoon, or intertidal flat. The lagoons continue to fill until the lagoon floor is exposed at low tide, and the sabkha begins to form. A sabkha may be inundated during higher than normal spring tides, after rainstorms, or when driving winds push seawater onshore to a depth of a few centimeters. Mature sabkhas are only flooded after heavy rainstorms and may eventually coalesce to form a sabkha coastal plain. These coastal plains are very flat, with reliefs between 10‚Äì50 cm, and their seaward slope can be as little as 1:1,000.Butler, G.P., 1969. Modern evaporite deposition and geochemistry of coexisting brines, the sabkha, Trucial Coast, Arabian Gulf. Journal of Sedimentary Research, 39(1). pp 70-89. The flatness of a sabkha is enhanced by aeolian siliciclastic dust being deposited in the topographic lows with most of the relief caused by evaporites.Patterson, R.J. and Kinsman, D.J.J., 1981. Hydrologic framework of a sabkha along Arabian Gulf. American Association of Petroleum Geologists bulletin, 65(8), pp.1457-1475. These environments can be found laterally contemporaneous in parallel belts to the coast as well. Coral reefs, barrier islands, and oolite shoals form the barrier with the open shelf.Alsharhan, A.S. and Kendall, C.S.C., 2003. Holocene coastal carbonates and evaporites of the southern Arabian Gulf and their ancient analogues. Earth-Science Reviews, 61(3-4), pp.191-243. These types of deposits are indicative of higher energy and protect the khor-lagoon environments, allowing for the growth of mangrove swamps and algal and cyano-bacterial mats that prefer the more closed, lower energy environment. Inland of this are the supratidal sabkhas. The sabkhas can be as wide as 15 km when seaward of dune fields supplying large amounts of sediment. Sabkhas seaward of low outcrops of Miocene carbonate-evaporites or alluvial fans off the Oman fold and thrust belt can be as narrow as several hundred meters.Al-Farraj, A., 2005. An evolutionary model for sabkha development on the north coast of the UAE. Journal of Arid Environments, 63(4), pp.740-755. Dune field If the coast has dune fields, then flooding creates many smaller pools between the crests of the dunes. In some parts of the world, these lakes can also form in inland deserts, filled by rain or a rising water table from underground aquifers. For example, large parts of the Empty Quarter in Saudi Arabia and the southern UAE consist of patterns of high drifting barchan dunes alternating with continental sabkha filled with salt flats. In some places, the continental sabkha connect to form long accessible corridors into the desert. { align=\\"center\\"  Dunes and salt flats in the Empty Quarter - 1.  Dunes and salt flats in the Empty Quarter - 2.  Dunes and salt flats south of the crescent-shaped Liwa Oasis (UAE). } The third picture shows the area south of the crescent-shaped Liwa Oasis in the southern UAE. The picture is about 80km wide, with each continental sabkha about 2-3 km long and 1 km wide. You can see white deposits of salt covering the surface of the continental sabkha. The Moreeb Dune, rising 120 m above the continental sabkha, is located roughly in the middle of the picture. The border between Saudi Arabia and the UAE is shown in red. The floor of a continental sabkha is usually a hard-packed combination of sand, mud and salt. It is easy to walk or drive 4x4 vehicles across the dry, continental sabkha. However, after rains and flash-floods, the continental sabkha fill with shallow layers of water, and cannot be crossed until they dry out to form a new crust. When the ground is partly dried, a salt crust forms over soft mud or hollow cavities, and a vehicle will become stuck after breaking through the crust. Here are two current examples of dune fields being flooded. The first is not a desert, but a coastal dune field in the Amazon region, flooded by heavy rains. The second is a dry inland desert in the Gobi region, flooded by ground water from nearby mountains. { align=\\"center\\"  Flooded dune field in the Len√ß√≥is Maranhenses National Park (Brazil).  Flooded dune field in the Badain Jaran Desert (China). } Climate effects The climate is one of the main factors in sabkha development. Rainfall in this arid region usually occurs as thunderstorms and averages 4 cm/year.Lokier, S. and Steuber, T., 2008. Quantification of carbonate-ramp sedimentation and progradation rates for the late Holocene Abu Dhabi shoreline. Journal of Sedimentary Research, 78(7), pp.423-431. Temperatures can range in excess of 50 ¬∞C to as low as 0 ¬∞C. Humidity is linked to the wind direction, with humidity as low as 20% in the mornings from off the dry interior and building in the afternoon as a strong, onshore wind prevail. At night, relative humidity of 100% can lead to dense fogs. Water temperatures vary by depth with shallow water as much as 10 ¬∞C warmer. These high temperatures drive high rates of evaporation in the Persian Gulf, as much as 124 cm/year leading salinity to increase in the shallow lagoons to as much as 70 ppt. The net rate of evaporation from the sabkha can be as much as an order of magnitude less and has averaged 6 cm for the last 4,000 to 5,000 years. The reasons for this are that the sabkha surface is not a free-water surface, the high humidity during the night, and vertical stratification of the air column. Despite the loss of water due to evaporation, the groundwater, never deeper than 1.5 m, flows seawards and is recharged by continental waters, rainstorms, and the northwest \\"shamal‚Äù gale- force winds that create waves of greater height than the intertidal height and drive water as much as 5 km inland over the sabkha to a depth of a few centimeters. The climate variations lead to the very dynamic nature of a sabkha. Halite is deposited on the surface of the sabkha and gypsum and aragonite precipitate in the subsurface via capillary action from brines brought up from the water table. In drier parts of the sabkha the gypsum can be altered to anhydrite and the aragonite can be dolomitized diagenetically. Thermal contraction at night and expansion during the day leads to concave polygonal pans as the edges have been upturned, in part due to growth of evaporites wedging the crack apart. Below this is a gypsum mush where nodules of anhydrite and other sulfates may develop. These might also form a ‚Äúchicken wire‚Äù crystalline structure. Below this are the intertidal deposits typified by laminated, organic-rich muds formed by the microbial mats that grade downward into more bioturbated muds. The subtidal facies show carbonate grainstones and lagoonal muds. These facies sequences, except for the halite that is frequently re-dissolved when wetted, can easily be preserved. Factors enabling preservation include the progradation of the sabkha with sedimentation rates of 1 m/1000 years and the creation of Stokes surfaces. These surfaces are created by the deflation of the sabkha surface that is related to the level of the groundwater table acting as a local base level.Shanley, K.W. and McCabe, P.J., 1994. Perspectives on the sequence stratigraphy of continental strata. American Association of Petroleum Geologists bulletin, 78(4), pp.544-568. Hydrocarbon reservoirs Sabkha deposits are believed to form some of the major subsurface hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Middle East (and elsewhere). The source of these hydrocarbons (both gas and oil) may be the microbial mats and mangrove paleosoils, found in the sabkha sequence, that have total organic carbon up to 8.2% and hydrogen indices typical of marine type II kerogens. Some ancient analogs include immediate subsurface formations such as the Permian Khuff Formation, Jurassic Arab and Hith anhydrites, and Tertiary sedimentary rocks. Similar deposits are also found in the Ordovician Williston Basin, the Permian Basin in Texas, as well as the Jurassic Gulf of Mexico. Modern sabkhas are present in varying form along the coasts of North Africa, Baja California, and at Shark Bay in Australia.

Rubin. Electric is used to draw schematics and to do integrated circuit layout. It can also handle hardware description languages such as VHDL and Verilog. The system has many analysis and synthesis tools, including Design rule checking, Simulation, Routing, Layout vs. Schematic, Logical Effort, and more. Electric is currently part of the GNU project and has been developed in Java and distributed as free and open-source software, subject to the requirements of the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 3 or any later. Alternative Design Style for Integrated Circuits Unlike other systems that design integrated circuits (ICs) by manipulating polygons on different layers of the wafer, Electric views IC layout as connected circuitry, similar to the way schematic capture systems work. In Electric, designers place nodes (transistors, contacts, etc.) and connect them with arcs (wires). This has advantages and disadvantages. One advantage is that circuits are always extracted, so analyses that need to know the topology (Layout vs. Schematic, Simulation, etc.) can run faster. Also, by presenting a schematic- capture-like user interface, the system offers a uniform user experience for both IC layout and schematic design. And finally, the nodes-and-arcs view of a circuit makes it easy to add layout constraints to the arcs which allow the designer to \\"program\\" the layout so that it stays connected as changes are made. This style of design also has disadvantages. One disadvantage is that designers are not used to such an interaction and require training in order to use it. It has been observed that people with no previous experience in IC layout are comfortable with Electric's unusual style, but those who have done IC layout on other systems find Electric difficult to use. Another disadvantage is that it is hard to import polygons from traditional systems because they have to be node-extracted, and the polygons don't always match the set of nodes and arcs provided by Electric. History Screenshot Electric VLSI Design System Electric was written in the C programming language in the early 1980s (the earliest internal memo on Electric is dated November 19, 1982). For some time after that, Electric was distributed free of charge to universities and research institutions, and found widespread international use. In the mid 1980s, Electric was sold commercially by Applicon, under the name \\"Bravo3VLSI\\". In 1988, Electric Editor Incorporated was founded, and sold the system commercially. The company released the source code through the Free Software Foundation in 1998. In 2000, Static Free Software was created to manage Electric's distribution. In September, 2003 the C version of Electric was abandoned, and the system was translated into the Java language. The work was completed in June, 2005. Although the C code is still available, it is no longer developed or supported. The new and improved Java code remains free to all users.

History In 1973 Westhill Secondary School and Homelands Technical High School, the latter being an all-boys school, joined to form Westlands School. It was split over two separate sites about half a mile from each other. The site on Westhill Road was known as the Lower School, whilst the other site, shared with Homelands Primary School in Westlands Lane, was known as the Upper School. The buildings on Westhill Road were originally built to be an army hospital during the Second World War and each classroom had walls made of multiple double doors where beds would have been brought in and out. Throughout the 1970s, the school became increasingly run down with little or no investment in buildings. In 1978, a major fire, which broke out in the upper school's chemistry department storeroom, exacerbated the situation by seriously damaging many classrooms. Both sites relied heavily on outside cabins to provide extra teaching facilities which, by the late 1990s, were old and became increasingly unfit for purpose. In 1999, Homelands Primary School relocated to the Westhill Road site to allow work to commence on the Upper School Site for a brand new school building. This was financed through the government's Private Finance Initiative (PFI) scheme, whereby Torbay Council owns the land whilst a private company built and owns the building, and manages the on site facilities, for a period of twenty-five years. The new school was built in sections, allowing the school to remain open during the works. The new building was opened to house the whole school in September 2001. Work then commenced on the Westhill Road site for a new building for Homelands Primary School. This was completed in Summer 2002. In September 2015 Westlands School became The Spires College.

A detail of the Belvedere Torso. Hellenistic art is the art of the Hellenistic period generally taken to begin with the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and end with the conquest of the Greek world by the Romans, a process well underway by 146 BCE, when the Greek mainland was taken, and essentially ending in 30 BCE with the conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt following the Battle of Actium. A number of the best-known works of Greek sculpture belong to this period, including Laoco√∂n and His Sons, Venus de Milo, and the Winged Victory of Samothrace. It follows the period of Classical Greek art, while the succeeding Greco-Roman art was very largely a continuation of Hellenistic trends. The term Hellenistic refers to the expansion of Greek influence and dissemination of its ideas following the death of Alexander ‚Äì the \\"Hellenizing\\" of the world, with Koine Greek as a common language. The term is a modern invention; the Hellenistic World not only included a huge area covering the whole of the Aegean, rather than the Classical Greece focused on the Poleis of Athens and Sparta, but also a huge time range. In artistic terms this means that there is huge variety which is often put under the heading of \\"Hellenistic Art\\" for convenience. One of the defining characteristics of the Hellenistic period was the division of Alexander's empire into smaller dynastic empires founded by the diadochi (Alexander's generals who became regents of different regions): the Ptolemies in Egypt, the Seleucids in Mesopotamia, Persia, and Syria, the Attalids in Pergamon, etc. Each of these dynasties practiced a royal patronage which differed from those of the city-states. In Alexander's entourage were three artists: Lysippus the sculptor, Apelles the painter, and Pyrgoteles the gem cutter and engraver. The period after his death was one of great prosperity and considerable extravagance for much of the Greek world, at least for the wealthy. Royalty became important patrons of art. Sculpture, painting and architecture thrived, but vase-painting ceased to be of great significance. Metalwork and a wide variety of luxury arts produced much fine art. Some types of popular art were increasingly sophisticated. There has been a trend in writing history to depict Hellenistic art as a decadent style, following the Golden Age of Classical Greece. The 18th century terms Baroque and Rococo have sometimes been applied to the art of this complex and individual period. A renewed interest in historiography as well as some recent discoveries, such as the tombs of Vergina, may allow a better appreciation of the period.  Architecture  In the architectural field, the dynasties following Hector resulted in vast urban plans and large complexes which had mostly disappeared from city-states by the 5th century BC. The Doric Temple was virtually abandoned. This city planning was quite innovative for the Greek world; rather than manipulating space by correcting its faults, building plans conformed to the natural setting. One notes the appearance of many places of amusement and leisure, notably the multiplication of theatres and parks. The Hellenistic monarchies were advantaged in this regard in that they often had vast spaces where they could build large cities: such as Antioch, Pergamon, and Seleucia on the Tigris. It was the time of gigantism: thus it was for the second temple of Apollo at Didyma, situated twenty kilometers from Miletus in Ionia. It was designed by Daphnis of Miletus and Paionios of Ephesus at the end of the fourth century BC, but the construction, never completed, was carried out up until the 2nd century AD. The sanctuary is one of the largest ever constructed in the Mediterranean region: inside a vast court (21.7 metres by 53.6 metres), the cella is surrounded by a double colonnade of 108 Ionic columns nearly 20 metres tall, with richly sculpted bases and capitals. Athens The Corinthian order was used for the first time on a full-scale building at the Temple of Olympian Zeus.  Olynthus  The ancient city of Olynthus was one of the architectural and artistic keystones in establishing a connection between the Classical and Hellenistic worlds. Over 100 homes were found at the Olynthus city site. Interestingly, the homes and other architecture were incredibly well preserved. This allows us to better understand the activities that took place in the homes and how space inside the homes was organized and utilized. Homes in Olynthus were typically squarer in shape. The desired home was not necessarily large or extravagant, but rather comfortable and practical. This was a mark of civilization that was extremely prominent in Greek culture during the Hellenistic period and beyond. Living a civilized life involved maintaining a sturdy living space, thus many brick-like materials were used in the construction of the homes. Stone, wood, mudbrick, and other materials were commonly used to build these dwellings. Another element that was increasingly popular during the Hellenistic period was the addition of a courtyard to the home. Courtyards served as a light source for the home as Greek houses were closed off from the outside to maintain a level of privacy. There have been windows found at some home sites, but they are typically high off the ground and small. Because of the issue of privacy, many individuals were forced to compromise on light in the home. Well-lit spaces were used for entertaining or more public activity while the private sectors of the home were dark and closed off which complicated housework. Courtyards were typically the focus of the home as they provided a space for entertaining and a source of light from the very interior of the home. They were paved with cobblestones or pebbles most often, but there have been discoveries of mosaicked courtyards. Mosaics were a wonderful way for the family to express their interests and beliefs as well as a way to add d√©cor to the home and make it more visually appealing. This artistic touch to homes at Olynthus introduces another element of civilized living to this Hellenistic society. Pergamon Pergamon in particular is a characteristic example of Hellenistic architecture. Starting from a simple fortress located on the Acropolis, the various Attalid kings set up a colossal architectural complex. The buildings are fanned out around the Acropolis to take into account the nature of the terrain. The agora, located to the south on the lowest terrace, is bordered by galleries with colonnades (columns) or stoai. It is the beginning of a street which crosses the entire Acropolis: it separates the administrative, political and military buildings on the east and top of the rock from the sanctuaries to the west, at mid-height, among which the most prominent is that which shelters the monumental Pergamon Altar, known as \\"of the twelve gods\\" or \\"of the gods and of the giants\\", one of the masterpieces of Greek sculpture. A colossal theatre, able to contain nearly 10,000 spectators, has benches embedded in the flanks of the hill.  Sculpture  Scene from the Alexander Sarcophagus Pliny the Elder, after having described the sculpture of the classical period notes: Cessavit deinde ars (\\"then art disappeared\\").Pliny the Elder, Natural History (XXXIV, 52) According to Pliny's assessment, sculpture declined significantly after the 121st Olympiad (296‚Äì293 BC). A period of stagnation followed, with a brief revival after the 156th (156‚Äì153 BC), but with nothing to the standard of the times preceding it. Bronze portrait of an unknown sitter, with inlaid eyes, Hellenistic period, 1st century BC, found in Lake Palestra of the Island of Delos. During this period sculpture became more naturalistic, and also expressive; there is an interest in depicting extremes of emotion. On top of anatomical realism, the Hellenistic artist seeks to represent the character of his subject, including themes such as suffering, sleep or old age. Genre subjects of common people, women, children, animals and domestic scenes became acceptable subjects for sculpture, which was commissioned by wealthy families for the adornment of their homes and gardens; the Boy with Thorn is an example. The Barberini Faun, 2nd-century BC Hellenistic or 2nd-century AD Roman copy of an earlier bronze Realistic portraits of men and women of all ages were produced, and sculptors no longer felt obliged to depict people as ideals of beauty or physical perfection.Smith, 33‚Äì40, 136‚Äì140 The world of Dionysus, a pastoral idyll populated by satyrs, maenads, nymphs and sileni, had been often depicted in earlier vase painting and figurines, but rarely in full-size sculpture. The drunk woman at Munich portrays without reservation an old woman, thin, haggard, clutching against herself her jar of wine. Portraiture The period is therefore notable for its portraits: One such is the Barberini Faun of Munich, which represents a sleeping satyr with relaxed posture and anxious face, perhaps the prey of nightmares. The Belvedere Torso, the Resting Satyr, the Furietti Centaurs and Sleeping Hermaphroditus reflect similar ideas.Smith, 127‚Äì154 Another famous Hellenistic portrait is that of Demosthenes by Polyeuktos, featuring a well-done face and clasped hands. Privatization Another phenomenon of the Hellenistic age appears in its sculpture: privatization, seen in the recapture of older public patterns in decorative sculpture. Portraiture is tinged with naturalism, under the influence of Roman art. New Hellenistic cities were springing up all over Egypt, Syria, and Anatolia, which required statues depicting the gods and heroes of Greece for their temples and public places. This made sculpture, like pottery, an industry, with the consequent standardization and some lowering of quality. For these reasons many more Hellenistic statues have survived than is the case with the Classical period. Second classicism Hellenistic sculpture repeats the innovations of the so-called \\"second classicism\\": nude sculpture-in-the-round, allowing the statue to be admired from all angles; study of draping and effects of transparency of clothing, and the suppleness of poses. Thus, Venus de Milo, even while echoing a classic model, is distinguished by the twist of her hips. \\"Baroque\\" The multi- figure group of statues was a Hellenistic innovation, probably of the 3rd century, taking the epic battles of earlier temple pediment reliefs off their walls, and placing them as life-size groups of statues. Their style is often called \\"baroque\\", with extravagantly contorted body poses, and intense expressions in the faces. =Pergamon= The Ludovisi Gaul killing himself and his wife, Roman copy after the Hellenistic original, Palazzo Massimo alle Terme. Pergamon did not distinguish itself with its architecture alone: it was also the seat of a brilliant school of sculpture known as Pergamene Baroque. The sculptors, imitating the preceding centuries, portray painful moments rendered expressive with three-dimensional compositions, often V-shaped, and anatomical hyper-realism. The Barberini Faun is one example. Gauls Attalus I (269‚Äì197 BC), to commemorate his victory at Caicus against the Gauls;‚Äî called Galatians by the Greeks ‚Äì had two series of votive groups sculpted: the first, consecrated on the Acropolis of Pergamon, includes the famous Gaul killing himself and his wife, of which the original is lost; the second group, offered to Athens, is composed of small bronzes of Greeks, Amazons, gods and giants, Persians and Gauls. Artemis Rospigliosi in the Louvre is probably a copy of one of them; as for copies of the Dying Gaul, they were very numerous in the Roman period. The expression of sentiments, the forcefulness of details ‚Äì bushy hair and moustaches here ‚Äì and the violence of the movements are characteristic of the Pergamene style. Great Altar These characteristics are pushed to their peak in the friezes of the Great Altar of Pergamon, decorated under the order of Eumenes II (197‚Äì159 BC) with a gigantomachy stretching 110 metres in length, illustrating in the stone a poem composed especially for the court. The Olympians triumph in it, each on his side, over Giants ‚Äì most of which are transformed into savage beasts: serpents, birds of prey, lions or bulls. Their mother Gaia comes to their aid, but can do nothing and must watch them twist in pain under the blows of the gods. =Colossus of Rhodes= One of the few city states who managed to maintain full independence from the control of any Hellenistic kingdom was Rhodes. After holding out for one year under siege by Demetrius Poliorcetes (305‚Äì304 BCE), the Rhodians built the Colossus of Rhodes to commemorate their victory. With a height of 32 meters, it was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Progress in bronze casting made it possible for the Greeks to create large works. Many of the large bronze statues were lost ‚Äì with the majority being melted to recover the material. =Laoco√∂n= Laoco√∂n Group, Vatican Museums, Rome. Discovered in Rome in 1506 and seen immediately by Michelangelo, beginning its huge influence on Renaissance and Baroque art. Laoco√∂n, strangled by snakes, tries desperately to loosen their grip without affording a glance at his dying sons. The group is one of very few non- architectural ancient sculptures that can be identified with those mentioned by ancient writers. It is attributed by Pliny the Elder to the Rhodian sculptors Agesander, Athenodoros, and Polydorus. The central group of the Sperlonga sculptures, with the Blinding of Polyphemus; cast reconstruction of the group, with at the right the original figure of the \\"wineskin-bearer\\" seen in front of the cast version. Johann Joachim Winckelmann, who first articulated the difference between Greek, Greco-Roman and Roman art, drew inspiration from the Laoco√∂n. Gotthold Ephraim Lessing based many of the ideas in his 'Laocoon' (1766) on Winckelmann's views on harmony and expression in the visual arts.Lessing contra Winckelmann =Sperlonga= The fragmentary Sperlonga sculptures are another series of \\"baroque\\" sculptures in the Hellenistic style, perhaps made for the Emperor Tiberius, who was certainly present at the collapse of the seaside grotto in southern Italy that they decorated. The inscriptions suggest the same sculptors made it who made the Laoco√∂n group, or possibly their relations. Neo-Attic From the 2nd century the Neo-Attic or Neo-Classical style is seen by different scholars as either a reaction to baroque excesses, returning to a version of Classical style, or as a continuation of the traditional style for cult statues.Smith, 240‚Äì241 Workshops in the style became mainly producers of copies for the Roman market, which preferred copies of Classical rather than Hellenistic pieces.Smith, 258‚Äì261 File:0 Monument fun√©raire - Adonis mourant - Museu Gregoriano Etrusco.JPGSepulchral monument of a dying Adonis, polychrome terracotta, Etruscan art from Tuscana, 250-100 BC File:Fragment of a marble relief depicting a Kore, 3rd century BC, from Panticapaeum, Taurica (Crimea) (12853680765).jpgFragment of a marble relief depicting a Kore, 3rd century BC, from Panticapaeum, Taurica (Crimea), Bosporan Kingdom File:Arte greca, pietra tombale di donna con la sua assistente, 100 ac. circa.JPGGravestone of a woman with her child slave attending to her, c. 100 BC (early period of Roman Greece) File:NAMA Jockey Art√©mision.jpgLate Hellenistic bronze of a mounted jockey, National Archaeological Museum, Athens File:Ptolemy I Soter Louvre Ma849.jpgBust of Ptolemy I Soter wearing a diadem, a symbol of Hellenistic kingship, Louvre Museum.

Paintings and mosaics Paintings and mosaics were important mediums in art, but no examples of paintings on panels have survived the fall to the Romans. It is possible to get some idea of what they were like from related media, and what seem to be copies of or loose derivations from paintings in a wider range of materials.  Landscape  Nile Mosaic of Palestrina, a Roman and Hellenistic floor mosaic depicting Ptolemaic Egypt, c. 100 BC Perhaps the most striking element of Hellenistic paintings and mosaics is the increased use of landscape. Landscapes in these works of art are representative of familiar naturalistic figures while also displaying mythological and sacro-idyllic elements. Landscape friezes and mosaics were commonly used to display scenes from Hellenistic poetry such as that by Herondas and Theocritos. These landscapes that expressed the stories of Hellenistic writers were utilized in the home to emphasize that family's education and knowledge about the literary world. Sacro-idyllic means that the most prominent elements of the artwork are those related to sacred and pastoral themes. This style that emerged most prevalently in Hellenistic art combines sacred and profane elements, creating a dreamlike setting. Sacro- idyllic influences are conveyed in the Roman mosaic \\"Nile Mosaic of Palestrina\\" which demonstrates fantastical narratives with a color scheme and commonplace components that illustrate the Nile in its passage from Ethiopia to the Mediterranean. The inclusion of Hellenistic backgrounds can also be seen in works throughout Pompeii, Cyrene, Alexandria. Moreover, specifically in Southern Russia, floral features and branches can be found on walls and ceilings strewn in a disordered yet conventional manner, mirroring a late Greek style. In addition, \\"Cubiculum\\" paintings found in Villa Boscoreale include vegetation and a rocky setting in the background of detailed paintings of grand architecture. Boscoreale, 50‚Äì40 B.C. Metropolitan Museum of Art 03.14.13a‚Äìg.  Wall paintings  Banquet scene from the tomb of Agios Athanasios, Thessaloniki, 4th century BC. Hellenistic terracotta funerary wall painting, 3rd century BCWall paintings began appearing more prominently in the Pompeian period. These wall paintings were not just displayed in places of worship or in tombs. Often, wall paintings were used to decorate the home. Wall paintings were common in private homes in Delos, Priene, Thera, Pantikapaion, Olbia, and Alexandria. Few examples of Greek wall paintings have survived the centuries. The most impressive, in terms of showing what high- quality Greek painting was like, are those at the Macedonian royal tombs at Vergina. Though Greek painters are given tribute to bringing fundamental ways of representation to the Western World through their art. Three main qualities unique to Hellenistic painting style were three-dimensional perspective, the use of light and shade to render form, and trompe l‚Äôoeil realism.Abbe, Mark B. \\"Painted Funerary Monuments from Hellenistic Alexandria\\". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000‚Äì. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pfmh/hd_pfmh.htm (April 2007) Very few forms of Hellenistic Greek painting survive except for wooden pinakes panels and those painted on stone. The most famously known stone paintings are found on the Macedonian Tomb at Agios Athanasios. Researchers have been limited to studying the Hellenistic influences in Roman frescoes, for example those of Pompeii or Herculaneum. In addition, some of the paintings in Villa Boscoreale clearly echo lost Hellenistic, Macedonian royal paintings.http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/haht/hd_haht.htm = Mediums and technique = Recent excavations from the Mediterranean have revealed the technology used in Hellenistic painting. Wall art of this period utilized two techniques: secco technique and fresco technique. Fresco technique required layers of lime-rich plaster to then decorate walls and stone supports. On the other hand, no base was necessary for the secco technique, which used gum arabic and egg tempera to paint finalizing details on marble or other stone. This technique is exemplified in the Masonry friezes found in Delos. Both techniques used mediums that were locally accessible, such as terracotta aggregates in the base layers and natural inorganic pigments, synthetic inorganic pigments, and organic substances as colorants.Macedonian soldier (thorakitai) wearing chainmail armor and bearing a thureos shield. =Recent discoveries= Recent discoveries include those of chamber tombs in Vergina (1987) in the former kingdom of Macedonia, where many friezes have been unearthed. For example, in Tomb II archaeologists found a Hellenistic- style frieze depicting a lion hunt. This frieze found in the tomb supposedly that of Philip II is remarkable by its composition, the arrangement of the figures in space and its realistic representation of nature. Other friezes maintain a realistic narrative, such as a symposium and banquet or a military escort, and possibly retell historical events. There is also the recently restored 1st-century Nabataean ceiling frescoes in the Painted House at Little Petra in Jordan. As the Nabataeans traded with the Romans, Egyptians, and Greeks, insects and other animals observed in the paintings reflect Hellenism while various types of vines are associated with the Greek god, Dionysus. Recent archaeological discoveries at the cemetery of Pagasae (close to modern Volos), at the edge of the Pagasetic Gulf have brought to light some original works. The excavations of this site led by Dr. Arvanitopoulos may be connected to various Greek painters in the 3rd and 4th centuries and depict scenes that allude to the reign of Alexander the Great. In the 1960s, a group of wall paintings was found on Delos. It is evident that the fragments of friezes found were created by a community of painters who lived during the late Hellenistic period. The murals emphasized domestic decoration, conveying the belief these people held that the Delian establishment would remain stable and secure enough for this artwork to be enjoyed by homeowners for many years to come. Mosaics Detail of the Alexander Mosaic, showing Alexander the Great, Roman copy c. 100 BC from the House of the Faun in Pompeii, from an original Hellenistic painting of the 3rd century BC, possibly by Philoxenus of Eretria. Certain mosaics, however, provide a pretty good idea of the \\"grand painting\\" of the period: these are copies of frescoes. This art form has been used to decorate primarily walls, floors, and columns. = Mediums and technique = The development of mosaic art during the Hellenistic Period began with Pebble Mosaics, best represented in the site of Olynthos from 5th century BC. The technique of Pebble Mosaics consisted of placing small white and black pebbles of no specific shape, in a circular or rectangular panel to illustrate scenes of mythology. The white pebbles -in slightly different shades- were placed on a black or blue background to create the image. The black pebbles served to outline the image. In the mosaics from the site of Pella, from the 4th century BC, it is possible to see a more evolved form of the art. Mosaics from this site display the use of pebbles that were shaded in a wider range of colors and tones. They also show early use of terra-cotta and lead wire to create a greater definition of contours and details to the images in the mosaics. Following this example, more materials were gradually added. Examples of this extended use of materials in mosaics of the 3rd century BC include finely cut stones, chipped pebbles, glass and baked clay, known as tessarae. This improved the technique of mosaics by aiding the artists in creating more definition, greater detail, a better fit, and an even wider range of colors and tones. Example of tesserae used in mosaics. Despite the chronological order of the appearance of these techniques, there is no actual evidence to suggest that the tessellated necessarily developed from the pebble mosaics. Opus vermiculatum and opus tessellatum were two different techniques used during this period of mosaic making. Opus tessellatum refers to a redacted tessera (a small block of stone, tile, glass, or other material used in the construction of a mosaic) size followed by an increased variety in shape, color, and material as well as andamento‚Äì‚Äìor the pattern in which the tessera was laid. Opus vermiculatum is oftentimes partnered with this technique but differs in complexity and is known to have the highest visual impact. The majority of mosaics were produced and laid on site. However, a number of floor mosaics display the use of the emblemata technique, in which panels of the image are created off-site in trays of terra-cotta or stone. These trays were later placed into the setting-bed on the site. At Delos, colored grouts were used on opus vermiculatum mosaics, but in other regions this is not common. There is one example of colored grout used in Alexandria on the Dog and Askos mosaic. At Samos, the grouts and the tesserae are both colored. Studying color here is difficult as the grouts are extremely fragile and vulnerable. Scientifics research has been a source of interesting information with regard to the grouts and tesserae used in Hellenistic Mosaics. Lead strips were discovered on mosaics as a definiting characteristic of the surface technique. Lead strips are absent from the mosaics here. At Delos, lead strips were common on mosaics in the opus tessellatum style. These strips were used to outline decorative borders and geometric decorative motifs. The strips were extremely common on opus vermiculatum mosaics from Alexandria. Because lead strips were present in both styles of surface types, they cannot be the sole characteristic of one type or the other. = Tel Dor mosaic = Detail of mosaic from Tel Dor circa 1st-2nd centuries. Found in Ha-Mizgaga Museum in 281x281px A rare example of virtuoso Hellenistic style picture mosaic found in the Levantine coast. Through a technical analysis of the mosaic, researchers suggest that this mosaic was created by itinerant craftsman working in situ. Since 2000, over 200 fragments of the mosaic have been discovered at the headline of Tel Dor, however, the destruction of the original mosaic is unknown. Excavators suggest that earthquake or urban renewal is the cause. Original architectural context is unknown, but stylistic and technical comparisons suggest a late Hellenistic period date, estimating around the second half of the second century B.C.E. Analyzing the fragments found at the original site, researchers have found that the original mosaic contained a centralized rectangle with unknown iconography surrounded by a series of decorative borders consisting of a perspective meander followed by a mask-and-garland border. This mosaic consists of two different techniques of mosaic making, opus vermiculatum and opus tessellatum. = Alexander mosaic = An example is the Alexander Mosaic, showing the confrontation of the young conqueror and the Grand King Darius III at the Battle of Issus, a mosaic from a floor in the House of the Faun at Pompeii (now in Naples). It is believed to be a copy of a painting described by Pliny which had been painted by Philoxenus of Eretria for King Cassander of Macedon at the end of the 4th century BC,Pliny the Elder, Natural History (XXXV, 110) or even of a painting by Apelles contemporaneous with Alexander himself. The mosaic allows us to admire the choice of colors along with the composition of the ensemble using turning movement and facial expression. =Stag Hunt mosaic= The \\"Dove Basin\\" (Capitoline), attributed to Sosos of Pergamon, from Hadrian's Villa, Tivoli, Lazio, 2nd century AD The Stag Hunt Mosaic by Gnosis is a mosaic from a wealthy home of the late 4th century BC, the so-called \\"House of the Abduction of Helen\\" (or \\"House of the Rape of Helen\\"), in Pella, The signature (\\"Gnosis epoesen\\", i.e. Gnosis created) is the first known signature of a mosaicist.Mosaics of the Greek and Roman world By Katherine M.

The emblema is bordered by an intricate floral pattern, which itself is bordered by stylized depictions of waves.Kleiner and Gardner, pg. 135 The mosaic is a pebble mosaic with stones collected from beaches and riverbanks which were set into cement. As was perhaps often the case, the mosaic does much to reflect styles of painting.Kleiner and Gardner, pg. 136 The light figures against a darker background may allude to red figure painting. The mosaic also uses shading, known to the Greeks as skiagraphia, in its depictions of the musculature and cloaks of the figures. This along with its use of overlapping figures to create depth renders the image three dimensional. =Sosos= The Hellenistic period is equally the time of development of the mosaic as such, particularly with the works of Sosos of Pergamon, active in the 2nd century BC and the only mosaic artist cited by Pliny.Pliny the Elder, Natural History (XXXVI, 184) His taste for trompe l'oeil (optical illusion) and the effects of the medium are found in several works attributed to him such as the \\"Unswept Floor\\" in the Vatican museum, representing the leftovers of a repast (fish bones, bones, empty shells, etc.) and the \\"Dove Basin\\" (made of small opus vermiculatum tesserae stones) at the Capitoline Museum, known by means of a reproduction discovered in Hadrian's Villa. In it one sees four doves perched on the edge of a gilt bronze basin filled with water. One of them is watering herself while the others seem to be resting, which creates effects of reflections and shadow perfectly studied by the artist. The \\"Dove Basin\\" mosaic panel is an emblema, designed to be the central point of an otherwise plain mosaic floor. The emblema was originally an import from the Hellenistic eastern Mediterranean, where, in cities such as Pergamom, Ephesus and Alexandria, there were artists specializing in mosaics. One of them was Sosos of Pergamon, the most celebrated mosaicist of antiquity who worked in the second century BC. =Delos= According to the French archaeologist Fran√ßois Chamoux, the mosaics of Delos in the Cyclades represent the zenith of Hellenistic-period mosaic art employing the use of tesserae to form complex, colorful scenes. This style of mosaic continued until the end of Antiquity and may have had an impact on the widespread use of mosaics in the Western world during the Middle Ages.

The Hellenistic Age comes immediately after the great age of painted Ancient Greek pottery, perhaps because increased prosperity led to more use of fine metalware (very little now surviving) and the decline of the fine painted \\"vase\\" (the term used for all vessel shapes in pottery). Most vases of the period are black and uniform, with a shiny appearance approaching that of varnish, decorated with simple motifs of flowers or festoons. The shapes of the vessels are often based on metalwork shapes: thus with the lagynos, a wine jar typical of the period. Painted vase types that continued production into the Hellenistic period include Hadra vases and Panathenaic amphora. A lekythos bottle in the Gnathia style depicting the winged goddess of victory, Nike, armed and dancing, Apulia (Magna Graecia), Italy Megarian ware It is also the period of so-called Megarian ware: mold-made vases with decoration in relief appeared, doubtless in imitation of vases made of precious metals. Wreaths in relief were applied to the body of the vase. One finds also more complex relief, based on animals or legendary creatures. =West Slope ware= A West Slope Ware kantharos, 330‚Äì300 BC, Kerameikos Archaeological Museum, Athens Red-figure painting had died out in Athens by the end of the 4th century BC to be replaced by what is known as West Slope Ware, so named after the finds on the west slope of the Athenian Acropolis. This consisted of painting in a tan coloured slip and white paint on a fired black slip background with some incised detailing. Representations of people diminished, replaced with simpler motifs such as wreaths, dolphins, rosettes, etc. Variations of this style spread throughout the Greek world with notable centres in Crete and Apulia, where figural scenes continued to be in demand. =Apulian= askos from Canosa di Puglia, depicting goddess Nike, the head of Medusa, and horses, 3rd century BC Gnathia vases Gnathia vases however were still produced not only in Apulian, but also in Campanian, Paestan and Sicilian vase painting. Centuripe vase in Palermo, 280‚Äì220 BC Canosa ware In Canosa di Puglia in South Italy, in 3rd century BC burials one might find vases with fully three-dimensional attachments. The distinguishing feature of Canosa vases are the water-soluble paints. Blue, red, yellow, light purple and brown paints were applied to a white ground. =Centuripe ware= The Centuripe ware of Sicily, which has been called \\"the last gasp of Greek vase painting\\", had fully coloured tempera painting including groups of figures applied after firing, contrary to the traditional practice. The fragility of the pigments prevented frequent use of these vases; they were reserved for use in funerals, and many were purely for display, for example with lids that did not lift off. The practice perhaps continued into the 2nd century BC, making it possibly the last vase painting with significant figures.Von Bothner, Dietrich, Greek vase painting, p. 67, 1987, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.) A workshop was active until at least the 3rd century BC. These vases are characterized by a base painted pink. The figures, often female, are represented in coloured clothing: blue-violet chiton, yellow himation, white veil. The style is reminiscent of Pompeii and draws more from grand contemporary paintings than on the heritage of the red-figure pottery.  Terracotta figurines  Wealthy 'Middle-class' women: so-called Tanagra figurine, Hellenistic Greece, 325‚Äì150 BC, Altes Museum Bricks and tiles were used for architectural and other purposes. Production of Greek terracotta figurines became increasingly important. Terracotta figurines represented divinities as well as subjects from contemporary life. Previously reserved for religious use, in Hellenistic Greece the terracotta was more frequently used for funerary and purely decorative, purposes. The refinement of molding techniques made it possible to create true miniature statues, with a high level of detail, typically painted. Several Greek styles continued into the Roman period, and Greek influence, partly transmitted via the Ancient Etruscans, on Ancient Roman pottery was considerable, especially in figurines. A grotesque woman holding a jar of wine, Kertch, second half of 4th century BC, Louvre. =Tanagra figurines= Tanagra figurines, from Tanagra in Boeotia and other centers, full of lively colours, most often represent elegant women in scenes full of charm. At Smyrna, in Asia Minor, two major styles occurred side-by-side: first of all, copies of masterpieces of great sculpture, such as the Farnese Hercules in gilt terracotta. Grotesques In a completely different genre, there are the \\"grotesques\\", which contrast violently with the canons of \\"Greek beauty\\": the koroplathos (figurine maker) fashions deformed bodies in tortuous poses ‚Äì hunchbacks, epileptics, hydrocephalics, obese women, etc. One could therefore wonder whether these were medical models, the town of Smyrna being reputed for its medical school. Or they could simply be caricatures, designed to provoke laughter. The \\"grotesques\\" are equally common at Tarsus and also at Alexandria. Negro One theme which emerged was the \\"negro\\", particularly in Ptolemaic Egypt: these statuettes of Black adolescents were successful up to the Roman period.Three Centuries of Hellenistic Terracottas Sometimes, they were reduced to echoing a form from the great sculptures: thus one finds numerous copies in miniature of the Tyche (Fortune or Chance) of Antioch, of which the original dates to the beginning of the 3rd century BC. Hellenistic pottery designs can be found in the city of Taxila in modern Pakistan, which was colonized with Greek artisans and potters after Alexander conquered it.

Metallic art  Because of so much bronze statue melting, only the smaller objects still exist. In Hellenistic Greece, the raw materials were plentiful following eastern conquests. The Derveni Krater, 4th century BC, Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki The work on metal vases took on a new fullness: the artists competed among themselves with great virtuosity. The Thracian Panagyurishte Treasure (from modern Bulgaria), includes Greek objects such as a gold amphora with two rearing centaurs forming the handles. A Greek glass amphora, 2nd half of the 2nd century BC, from Olbia, Roman-era Sardinia, now in the Altes Museum The Derveni Krater, from near Thessaloniki, is a large bronze volute krater from about 320 BC, weighing 40 kilograms, and finely decorated with a 32-centimetre-tall frieze of figures in relief representing Dionysus surrounded by Ariadne and her procession of satyrs and maenads. The neck is decorated with ornamental motifs while four satyrs in high relief are casually seated on the shoulders of the vase. The evolution is similar for the art of jewelry. The jewelers of the time excelled at handling details and filigrees: thus, the funeral wreaths present very realistic leaves of trees or stalks of wheat. In this period the insetting of precious stones flourished.  Glass and glyptic art  It was in the Hellenistic period that the Greeks, who until then only knew molded glass, discovered the technique of glass blowing, thus permitting new forms. Beginning in Syria, the art of glass developed especially in Italy. Molded glass continued, notably in the creation of intaglio jewelry. The art of engraving gems hardly advanced at all, limiting itself to mass-produced items that lacked originality. As compensation, the cameo made its appearance. It concerns cutting in relief on a stone composed of several colored layers, allowing the object to be presented in relief with more than one color. The Hellenistic period produced some masterpieces like the Gonzaga cameo, now in the Hermitage Museum, and spectacular hardstone carvings like the Cup of the Ptolemies in Paris. Coinage Coinage in the Hellenistic period increasingly used portraits. File:Image larnax of philip.jpgThe golden larnax of Philip II of Macedon which contained his remains.

They did so by creating molds of original sculptures, producing plaster casts that could be sent to any sculptor's workshop of the Mediterranean where these works of art could be duplicated. These were often faithful reproductions of originals, yet other times they fused several elements of various artworks into one group, or simply added Roman portraiture heads to preexisting athletic Greek bodies.Department of Greek and Roman Art (October 2002). \\"Roman Copies of Greek Statues.\\" In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History.

Bison were rounded up in Wainwright, Alberta, and transported by land and river to Wood Buffalo National Park in the far north of Alberta. Buffalo National Park was created near the town of Wainwright in east central Alberta on June 5, 1909. It was closed in 1940 and delisted in 1947 when the land was transferred to the Department of National Defence. The park land now comprises the majority of Canadian Forces Base Wainwright. The first Park Warden was Bud Cotton, who served from 1912 through 1940. Buffalo National Park, with a focus on plains bison (often referred to as buffalo), was one of several national parks created in the Canadian Prairies expressly to protect and regenerate dangerously low populations of bison and pronghorns. Other 'regeneration' parks, also delisted in 1947, included Wawaskesy National Park, Nemiskam National Park (both in Alberta), and Menissawok National Park in Saskatchewan. Buffalo National Park was populated by the Canadian government with a herd of roughly 700 bison purchased from the Flathead Indian Reservation in the U.S. state of Montana. The herd was transported to the new park by train. The park also received smaller populations of elk and moose. During its thirty one years of activity, the park produced 40,000 bison, 3000 elk, and 300 moose. The park eventually fell victim to its own success, for as numbers grew, disease and starvation spread among the herd, competing for food on the park's limited space. Sanctioned slaughters in the late 1910s brought public outcry. Culling continued on an annual basis thereafter, including the transfer or sale of bison to other parks, such as about 6000 to 7000 head sent to Wood Buffalo National Park during the 1920s. With its mission accomplished, the park was closed in 1940. In 1980, to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Alberta and the legacy of the former Buffalo National Park, four bison from Elk Island National Park were moved to Wainwright. Today, about a dozen bison reside on CFB Wainwright in Bud Cotton Paddock, named for the first Park Warden.

For the correct spelling. See Sherwood (1923), pp. 150, 156, 158, 159, etc.; Ellis and Thornborough (1923), p. 262. was an American film studio of the silent era, a producer and distributor of mostly low-budget films. It was founded in 1920 as Robertson‚ÄìCole (U.S.), the American division of a British import‚Äìexport company formed by the English- born Harry F. Robertson. Robertson-Cole bought the Hallmark Exchanges (formerly the Mutual Exchanges that became known as Exhibitors-Mutual Exchanges) from Frank G. Hall in 1920. Exhibitors-Mutual/Hallmark had distributed Robertson-Cole product, and acquiring the exchanges gave them the right to distribute their own films plus Hall's product, with the exception of Charlie Chaplin reissues which he had the rights to. Robertson-Cole initiated movie production in the United States in 1920. That year, it incorporated Robertson-Cole Studios, Inc. and bought 460 acres in Pacific Palisades, California to establish a studio. The property, which became known as the \\"R.C. Ranch\\", enabled Robertson-Cole to centralize movie production, which previously had been scattered. The movie company had relied on equipment rentals to produce motion pictures. Two years later, a corporate reorganization led to the company's new name, with FBO becoming the official name of the distributing operation and Robertson-Cole Pictures Corp. the name of the production operation. In 1923, the studio contracted with Western actor Fred Thomson, who would soon emerge as one of Hollywood's most popular stars. Thomson was just one of numerous screen cowboys with whom FBO became identified. The studio, whose core market was America's small towns, also put out many romantic melodramas, non-Western action pictures, and comedic shorts. In 1926, financier Joseph P. Kennedy led a group that acquired the company. In June 1928, using RCA Photophone technology, FBO became the second Hollywood studio to release a feature-length \\"talkie.\\" A few months later, when Kennedy and RCA chief David Sarnoff arranged the merger that created RKO, FBO was included in the new company. Business history Foundation and identity FBO logo from 1924‚Äì25 The company that would become FBO began as the U.S.-based film subsidiary of the British importer, exporter, and film distributor Robertson-Cole. This organization was similar in structure to the French Path√© Exchange company, a subsidiary of the French Path√© Fr√®res company. From its U.S. headquarters in New York City, R-C Pictures, as it was sometimes known, first entered the American film distribution market. In 1919, the company forged an alliance with Exhibitors Mutual Distributing, a corporate descendant of the Mutual Film studio.Goodwin (1987) describes Robertson-Cole as an \\"American motion picture firm\\" (p. 341), which was functionally true after a certain point, but Jewell (1982) makes clear that the company was founded in Britain and that its American operations were run by Britishmen through 1922 (p. 8). As Goodwin and Jewell concur, majority ownership of FBO remained in British hands until 1926. The first of R-C's own feature productions to be released was The Wonder Man, directed by John G. Adolfi and starring Georges Carpentier, which debuted May 29, 1920.For a description of the film, see the anonymous New York Times review, May 30, 1920 (available online). With its move into production, Robertson-Cole established a 13.5-acre (5.5-hectare) studio in Los Angeles's fortuitously named Colegrove district, then adjacent to but soon to be subsumed by Hollywood.The studio's address was and remains 780 Gower Street. See Finler (1988), p. 12, for a map showing the FBO studio (later owned by RKO, Desilu, and now CBS Paramount Television) in relation to the other main Hollywood production facilities. Finler misidentifies Melrose Ave., which runs east-west along the south of the studio, as \\"Beverly Boulevard.\\" Gower St. runs north-south along the studio's western side. In January 1921, Robertson-Cole absorbed Hallmark Pictures, which had acquired the Exhibitors Mutual interests the previous year.Lyons (1974), p. 90 n. 123. The first official Robertson-Cole production shot at the new studio was a February 1921 release, The Mistress of Shenstone, directed by Henry King and starring beautiful Pauline Frederick, a former Paramount and Goldwyn star.For descriptions of the film, see the reviews in Moving Picture World (March 5, 1921) and Variety (March 18, 1921). That year, the British owners of the studio entered into a working relationship with Joseph P. Kennedy, father of future U.S. president John F. Kennedy. Joseph Kennedy was then a broker at the New York banking firm of Hayden, Stone, as well as the owner of Maine‚ÄìNew Hampshire Theatres, a small chain of movie houses.Goodwin (1987), p. 342. Though he failed to arrange the sale R-C's general partners were looking for, Kennedy's involvement with the studio was far from over. In 1922, Robertson-Cole underwent a major reorganization as the company's founders departed, though the corporation remained under majority British ownership. The flagship U.S. distribution business changed its name to Film Booking Offices of America, a banner under which R-C had released more than a dozen independent productions. The West Coast studio apparently continued to make films under the Robertson-Cole name for some time, but FBO ultimately became the primary identity of the business for production as well as distribution.See, e.g., \\"F.B.O. Announces\\" (1925) for evidence that the studio was primarily identified as FBO by no later than summer 1925. Though Robertson-Cole apparently remained the primary production brand for a period after the 1922 reorganization, Lasky (1989, p. 13) and Jewell (1982, p. 8) both indicate that the entire film business was incorporated that year as Film Booking Offices of America Inc. Beauchamp (1998) refers to Kennedy's 1926 takeover of \\"R-C Pictures Corporation and Film Booking Office of America\\" (p. 180). These various references suggest that, from 1922 forward, R-C (or Robertson-Cole) Pictures Corp. was the legal name of FBO (or Film Booking Offices of America) Inc.'s studio subsidiary. Logos from 1927 and 1928 (the latter pictured in the article) reading \\"FBO Pictures Corp.\\" suggest that the corporate name of the studio operation was changed after the Kennedy purchase. Between the 1922 reorganization and October 1923, one of the company's new American investors, Pat Powers, was effectively in command. Powers had previously led his own filmmaking company, part of the multiple merger that created the large Universal studio in 1912. Powers apparently changed the name of Robertson-Cole/FBO to the Powers Studio for a brief period, though there is no record of the company ever having produced or released a film under that banner.Lasky (1989), p. 13; Jewell (1982), p. 8. In 1923, the studio launched a series of boxing-themed shorts, Fighting Blood, starring George O'Hara. He would become an FBO mainstay, often paired with Alberta Vaughn, in such comedy series as The Pacemakers (1925). Most of O'Hara's and Vaughn's films for the studio were two-reelers‚Äîa measure of film length indicating a running time of about twenty minutes. Love and Learn (1924) was the tenth installment of The Telephone Girl, a series of shorts starring Alberta Vaughn. This was not a serial in the classic sense, as each \\"chapter\\" was a stand-alone tale. Now a fully independent businessman, Joseph Kennedy joined the FBO board of directors in 1923, as well. By this time, the studio was owned by Graham's of London, a banking firm, and Powers was succeeded by H.C.S. Thomson, a Graham's operative.Lasky (1989), p. 13. Before leaving the board the following year, Kennedy put together a major distribution and production deal between FBO and leading Western star Fred Thomson.Beauchamp (1998), pp. 157‚Äì58. See also John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum/Joseph P. Kennedy (#136) descriptive summary of material from the inventory of the late president's papers; refer to \\"Biographical Note.\\" Retrieved May 6, 2007. B. P. Fineman became the studio's production chief in 1924; Evelyn Brent, his wife, moved over from Fox to become FBO's top dramatic star.Jewell (1982), p. 8. In April 1925, FBO vice-president Joseph I. Schnitzer signed Thomson to a new contract paying him $10,000 a week (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars). Thomson was now the highest paid of all cowboy actors, surpassing even the renowned Tom Mix. The deal also gave Thomson his own independent production unit at the studio.Beauchamp (1998), p. 168. As a distributor, FBO's roster of films was about half independent and foreign productions, half its own studio output. At the height of its activity (1923‚Äì28), it released an average of around 110 features and shorts a year, focusing on distribution to small-town exhibitors and independent theater chains (that is, those not owned by one of the major Hollywood studios).Beauchamp (1998), p. 157. As a production company, Film Booking Offices concentrated on low-budget movies, with an emphasis on Westerns, romantic melodramas, and comedy shorts. From its first productions in early 1920 through late 1928, when it was dissolved in a merger, the company produced approximately 400 films under the brand of either Robertson- Cole Pictures or FBO Pictures. Between 1924 and 1926, several higher-end productions were made under the rubric of Gothic Pictures. The studio's top- of-the-line movies, aimed at major exhibition venues beyond the reach of most FBO films, were sometimes marketed as FBO \\"Gold Bond\\" pictures.\\"F.B.O. Announces\\" (1925). Without the backing of large corporate interests, nor the security of its own theater chain, the company faced cash-flow difficulties during its earlier years. Short-term loans at high interest rates posed a significant financial drain.Lasky (1989), pp. 12‚Äì13, 14‚Äì15; Beauchamp (1998), p. 180. Kennedy takes command FBO distribution logo from 1926 While still at Hayden, Stone, Kennedy had boasted to a colleague, \\"Look at that bunch of pants pressers in Hollywood making themselves millionaires. I could take the whole business away from them.\\"Quoted in Lasky (1989), p. 12. In 1925, he set out to do so, forming his own group of investors led by wealthy Boston lawyer Guy Currier and including Filene's department store owner Louis Kirstein and Union Stockyards and Armour and Company owner Frederick H. Prince. In August 1925, Kennedy traveled to England with an offer to buy a controlling stake in Film Booking Offices for $1 million. The bid was initially rejected, but in February 1926, FBO's owners decided to take the money.Goodwin (1987), pp. 342, 343; Beauchamp (1998), p. 180; Lasky (1989), p. 13. Crafton (1997) writes that the business Joseph Kennedy purchased in February 1926 was \\"a small Hollywood studio, Robertson-Cole, and its New York distributor, Film Booking Office (FBO)\\" (p. 136). This is potentially misleading, even aside from the misspelling of FBO's name; the available evidence demonstrates that Film Booking Offices was already the studio operation's primary identity, even though it might still have been registered as R-C Pictures Corporation or some variation thereof. Crafton's nomenclature is belied by his own earlier listing of the significant U.S. film production companies of the mid-1920s, among which he names \\"Film Booking Office (FBO),\\" not Robertson‚ÄìCole (p. 68). In short order, Kennedy moved his family from Massachusetts to New York City to focus on running his new business. He swiftly addressed the company's perennial cash-flow problems, arranging lines of credit and issuing stock in a business division he established, the Cinema Credit Corporation.Lasky (1989), pp. 14‚Äì15; Goodwin (1987), p. 344. By March, he was traveling to Hollywood.Goodwin (1987), pp. 345, 346. The president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association, Will Hays, was delighted by the new face on the scene‚Äîin Hays's eyes, Kennedy signified both a desirable image for the industry and Wall Street's faith in its prospects. Hays heralded Kennedy as \\"exceedingly American\\" (historian Cari Beauchamp explains the connotation: \\"not Jewish,\\" in contrast to most of the studio heads), while celebrating Kennedy's \\"background of lofty and conservative financial connections, an atmosphere of much home and family life and all those fireside virtues of which the public never hears in the current news from Hollywood.\\"Quoted in Beauchamp (1998), p. 180. See also p. 197; Lasky (1989), p. 14. For Hays and Kennedy's earlier association, see Goodwin (1987), p. 341. Publicity photo of Fred Thomson, FBO's biggest box-office draw during the mid-1920s Fineman and Brent both departed FBO around the time of the purchase. Kennedy appointed Edwin King as the studio's production chief, but the new owner took a personal hand in guiding the company creatively as well as financially.Lasky (1989), p. 15. Crafton (1997) misleadingly implies that Kennedy immediately installed William LeBaron as production chief after his takeover of FBO (p. 136). In fact, as Jewell (1982) describes, King was the first head of production named by Kennedy, with LeBaron assuming the job in 1927 (p. 9). Kennedy soon brought stability to FBO, making it one of the most reliably profitable outfits in the minor leagues of the Hollywood studio system. Westerns remained the studio's backbone, along with various action pictures and romantic scenarios; as Kennedy put it, \\"Melodrama is our meat.\\"Quoted in Goodwin (1987), p. 348. During this period, the average production cost of FBO features was around $50,000, and few were budgeted at anything more than $75,000.Goodwin (1987), p. 348; Jewell (1982), p. 9. By comparison, in 1927‚Äì28 the average cost at Fox was $190,000; at Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer, $275,000.Finler (1988), p. 36. One major expense was taken on directly by Kennedy: with several studios competing for Fred Thomson, Kennedy signed him to a personal contract for $15,000 a week. This was the highest straight salary for any actor in the industry, matched only by Tom Mix's new arrangement with Fox.Beauchamp (1998), pp. 210, 211; Koszarski (1990), p. 116. Under the contract, Kennedy struck a deal in early 1927 with Paramount Pictures for the major studio to produce and distribute a series of four Thomson \\"super westerns.\\" Kennedy participated in the films' financing (and profits) and the actor's company stayed on the FBO lot. Of the four Thomson features that reached theaters in 1927, three were FBO releases.Beauchamp (1998), pp. 211, 227. Sound enters the picture FBO logo from 1928 The advent of sound film would drastically alter the studio's course: Negotiations that began in late 1927 with the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) on a deal for sound conversion led to RCA purchasing a major interest in FBO in January 1928. Four months later, as part of a strategy conceived with RCA head David Sarnoff, Kennedy acquired control of Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO), a vaudeville exhibition chain with approximately one hundred theaters across the United States, and with the Path√© Exchange and Cecil B. DeMille's Producers Distributing Corporation under its control.\\"Cinemerger\\" (1927); Lasky (1989), pp. 24‚Äì26. Note that the statement in Jewell (1982) referring to \\"the 700 K-A-O Theatres in the US and Canada\\" (p. 10) is wildly inaccurate and may well be a typo. Lasky (1989) says \\"several hundred theaters\\" (p. 25), Beauchamp (1998), citing Lasky, says \\"three hundred theaters\\" (quote: p. 228, cite: p. 414 n. 41)‚Äîfigures belied by Time magazine's contemporary data (see \\"Cinemerger\\"). On June 17, 1928, FBO's The Perfect Crime, directed by Bert Glennon and starring Clive Brook and Irene Rich, debuted.For a description of the film, see the anonymous New York Times review, August 6, 1928 (available online). According to Crafton (1997), The Perfect Crime \\"premiered June 17, 1928 and opened at the Rivoli on August 4\\" (p. 140). It was the first feature- length \\"talkie\\" to appear from a studio other than Warner Bros. since the epochal premiere of Warners' The Jazz Singer eight months before. The Perfect Crime, which went into general release on August 4, had been shot silently. Using the RCA Photophone sound-on-film system, the dialogue was dubbed in afterward‚Äîa process then known as \\"synthetic sound.\\"Crafton (1997), pp. 140, 304. On August 22, Kennedy signed a contract with RCA for live Photophone recording; more importantly, he also tendered the company an option to buy his governing share of FBO. Two months later, RCA had acquired controlling stock interests in both the studio and KAO. On October 23, 1928, RCA announced it was merging Film Booking Offices and Keith-Albee-Orpheum to form the new motion picture business Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO), with Sarnoff as chairman.While all other latter-day published sources give October as the date of the merger, Crafton (1997) states, \\"The new holding company, Radio-Keith- Orpheum, was formed on 21 November 1928\\" (p. 142). Kennedy, who retained Path√©, was paid $150,000 for arranging the merger on top of the millions of dollars in profit he made from selling off his stock.Lasky (1989), pp. 33‚Äì34. Joseph I. Schnitzer, ranking FBO vice-president, was elevated to president of the new company's production arm, replacing Kennedy.Jewell (1982), p. 10. William LeBaron, the last FBO production chief, retained his position after the merger, but the new studio, dedicated to full sound production, cut ties with most of FBO's roster of silent-screen performers. Movies that Film Booking Offices had either produced or arranged to distribute were released under the FBO banner through the end of 1929. The last official FBO production to reach American theaters was Pals of the Prairie, directed by Louis King and starring Buzz Barton and Frank Rice, released July 1, 1929. Cinematic legacy Headliners and celebrity casting Publicity photo of Evelyn Brent, star of 14 FBO films between 1924 and 1926 The vast majority of FBO/Robertson-Cole pictures, produced during either the silent era or the transitional period of the conversion to sound cinema, are considered to be lost films, with no copies now known to exist. Partly in consequence, many of FBO's star actors are barely remembered today. Pauline Frederick was the major headliner of the early R-C days, and Evelyn Brent was FBO's most prized non- Western star. Warner Baxter, Joe E. Brown, and young Frankie Darro were among the other prominent FBO players. Anna Q. Nilsson starred in two of the studio's larger productions, as did Olive Borden and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. FBO's leading star of action and mystery pictures was Richard Talmadge. He appeared in eighteen FBO releases, more than half of them produced by his own company. Maurice \\"Lefty\\" Flynn starred in over a dozen FBO action films, all directed by Harry Garson, who also ran his own production business.For more on Flynn, see Christgau (1999), pp. 55‚Äì59. From the studio's pre-Hollywood days in 1920 through 1928, Ralph Lewis starred in more than ten R-C and FBO pictures of various genres. Former model Reed Howes, renowned as an \\"Arrow Collar Man\\", made his acting debut with FBO after an extensive publicity campaign.Corneau (1969), p. 85. In its earlier years, the studio did not hesitate to take advantage of scandal sheet‚Äìworthy events. After the death of celebrated Paramount actor Wallace Reid, brought on by morphine addiction, his widow, Dorothy Davenport, signed on as producer and star of a cinematic examination of the sins of substance abuse: Human Wreckage, released by FBO in June 1923, five months after Reid's death, featured Davenport (billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid) as the wife of a noble attorney turned dope fiend.Schaefer (1999), p. 224. When the biggest movie star in the world, Rudolph Valentino, split from his wife, Natacha Rambova, she was swiftly enlisted by the studio to costar with Clive Brook in the sensitively titled When Love Grows Cold (1926).Goodwin (1987), p. 341. Under Kennedy's control, studio production shifted away from provocative fare in an attempt to brand the studio's films as suitable for the \\"average American\\" and the entire family: \\"We can't make pictures and label them 'For Children,' or 'For Women' or 'For Stout People' or 'For Thin Ones.' We must make pictures that have appeal to all.\\"Quoted in Goodwin (1987), p. 347. Though Kennedy ended the scandal-sheet specials, FBO still found occasion for celebrity casting: One Minute to Play (1926), directed by Sam Wood, marks the film debut of football great \\"Red\\" Grange.Hall (1926). See also Heritage Vintage (2004b), p. 121. Western stars The Cowboy Cop (1926) was headlined by Tom Tyler. The most prolific of FBO's many Western stars, Tyler appeared in 29 movies for the studio. Central to the FBO identity were Westerns and the studio's major cowboy star, Fred Thomson. In both 1926 and 1927, he ranked number two in the Exhibitors' Herald survey of the \\"Top Stars of the Year,\\" right behind Tom Mix.Beauchamp (1998), p. 224. With Thomson's personal contract with Kennedy due to expired in mid-1927,Lasky (1989), p. 17; Beauchamp (1998), p. 227. Kennedy‚Äîsending that Thomson had reached the peak of his popularity and seeing a financial opportunity for FBO‚Äîarranged a four-picture deal with Paramount Pictures, one of the major Hollywood studio. The deal essentially ceded Thomson to the rival studio. For FBO's guarantee of $75,000 in financing per picture, Thomson would star in Paramount productions. In return, Paramount would return the $75,000 in financing plus an additional $100,000 to FBO and pay Thomson's $15,000 a week salary. In 1928, Kennedy replaced Thomson by signing Tom Mix, whose contract with William Fox's Fox Film Corporation had expired. Mix played hard-to-get, threatening to move to Argentina to make films or joining the circus, but eventually, he signed with FBO but eventually left for Universal due to salary disputes with the studio. He said of Kennedy that he was a \\"tight-assed, money-crazed son-of-a-bitch\\". FBO's second-biggest long-running Western star was Tom Tyler. According to a June 1927 report in Moving Picture World: > With Tom Tyler rapidly taking the place recently vacated by Fred Thomson, > F.B.O.'s program of western pictures is taking a place second to none in the > industry.... Tyler has made rapid strides during his two years with F.B.O. > and with his horse 'Flash' and dog 'Beans' has become one of the leading > favorites on the screen.Moving Picture World, June 11, 1927. In addition to these three big names there was also Harry Carey, still a major star when he made several films for the studio in 1922‚Äì23. The other cowboy stars of FBO included Bob Custer, Bob Steele, and teenager Buzz Barton. Canine stars One of the studio's most reliable Western headliners was a dog: Ranger.The suggestion by Goodwin (1987) that, during Kennedy's tenure, FBO made \\"a dozen dog pictures...each year\\" (p. 348) is exaggerated. Ranger, the studio's only canine headliner of the Kennedy era, starred in sixteen pictures over the course of three years. From before the Kennedy era through 1928, Beans had featured roles in a number of Tom Tyler/Frankie Darro Westerns. For examples of how such films were marketed, see Heritage Vintage (2004a), p. 79, and Heritage Vintage (2005), p. 35. In the latter, note that the text accompanying the reproduced poster of Tom and His Pals (1926) incorrectly identifies the film as a Paramount picture; despite what the text implies, this was not the first film teaming Tyler and Darro. The fabled Strongheart starred in FBO's White Fang (1925), and Rin Tin Tin had one of his earliest roles in My Dad (1922).For a description of the former, see Sandburg (1925), pp. 270‚Äì271. For a description of the latter, see Janiss Garza, \\"My Dad\\" Allmovie review; part of New York Times website. Retrieved May 9, 2007. Short subjects and animation FBO's many shorts‚Äîthe popular George O'Hara and Alberta Vaughn series, and scores of others‚Äîare largely forgotten. Of particular historical interest are two independently produced series of slapstick comedies with important performers: FBO put out several shorts in 1924‚Äì25 made by Joe Rock and starring Stan Laurel, before his famous partnership with Oliver Hardy. In 1926‚Äì27, the company distributed more than a dozen shorts by innovative comedian/animator Charles Bowers.For more on Bowers' work with FBO, see Crafton (1993), p. 362 n. 39. In addition to the work of Charles Bowers, FBO was a distributor of other significant animated films. Between 1924 and 1926, FBO released the work of John Randolph Bray's cartoon studio, including the Dinky Doodle series created by Walter Lantz.Crafton (1993), pp. 186, 187; Langer (1995), pp. 105, 259 n. 40. For posters of two Bray/Lantz cartoons distributed by FBO, see Heritage Vintage (2004b), p. 51. From 1925 to 1927, the studio put out approximately three dozen animated adaptations of George Herriman newspaper comics directed by William Nolan, featuring characters from Herriman's famed Krazy Kat strip. FBO picked up the Krazy Kat cartoons from the distribution team of Margaret Winkler and her husband, Charles Mintz. In 1926, FBO struck a deal with the Winkler‚ÄìMintz operation for another series, one that, like Bowers' shorts, involved both animation and a live performer: the Alice Comedies, of which FBO would put out over two dozen, were created by two young animators, Ub Iwerks and Walt Disney.Crafton (1993), p. 285; Langer (1995), p. 259 n. 39. Notable films and filmmakers James Pierce in FBO's Tarzan and the Golden Lion (1927), which brought the famous character back to the big screen for the first time in six years. Tarzan would remain a Hollywood fixture for the next four decades. Kennedy had no illusions about his studio's place in the realm of cinematic art. A journalist once complimented him on FBO's recent output: \\"You have had some good pictures this year.\\" Kennedy jocularly inquired, \\"What the hell were they?\\"Quoted in Lasky (1989), p. 14. In her history of RKO, author Betty Lasky points to the pre-Kennedy Broken Laws (1924), directed by Roy William Neill and starring Dorothy Davenport (again billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid) as exemplifying the rare \\"unforgettable picture of the higher caliber\\" put out by FBO.Lasky (1989), p. 14. Among the studio's action movies, one standout production was a 1927 Tarzan picture. Author Edgar Rice Burroughs declared, \\"If you want to see the personification of Tarzan of the Apes as I visualize him, see the film Tarzan and the Golden Lion with Mr. James Pierce.\\"Quoted in Fenton (2002), p. 107. The Film Daily reviewer wrote that the movie \\"has a rather new order of thrills and atmosphere that might prove distinctly attractive.\\" The two-reeler West of Hot Dog (1924), according to historian Simon Louvish, contains \\"one of Stan [Laurel]'s finest gags,\\" involving a level of cinematic technique that bears comparison to Buster Keaton's classic Sherlock Jr.Louvish (2001), pp. 171‚Äì72. Some of the studio's most impressive releases were foreign productions. In 1927, FBO picked up for U.S. distribution a celebrated Austrian biblical spectacular made three years earlier: Die Sklavenk√∂nigin (The Slave Queen, aka Moon of Israel) had already won its director, Michael Kert√©sz, a job with Warner Bros.Kemp (1987), p. 173. In Hollywood, he would change his name to Michael Curtiz. Una Nueva y gloriosa naci√≥n (1928), the most successful film in the history of Argentine silent cinema, was shot in Hollywood and distributed in the United States by FBO as The Charge of the Gauchos.Finkielman (2004), p. 84. A masked Brent in the title role of Lady Robin Hood (1925), directed by Ralph Ince.For a description of the film, see Buehrer (1993), pp. 43‚Äì44. Her cowering foe is played by Boris Karloff, who appeared in six FBO pictures between 1925 and 1927. One of the two cinematographers of Una Nueva y gloriosa naci√≥n was Nicholas Musuraca, who established his career at Film Booking Offices. With RKO, Musuraca would become one of Hollywood's most respected cinematographers. Among FBO's other offscreen talent, the best known director to work regularly at the studio was Ralph Ince, younger brother of famous filmmaker Thomas H. Ince. Pulling double duty on occasion, Ralph Ince starred in four of the fourteen films he made for FBO. One production in which Ince served in both capacities was particularly well received: Chicago After Midnight (1928) was described by the New York Times as \\"[a]n unusually well-acted and adroitly directed underworld story.\\"Hall (1928). After The Mistress of Shenstone, Henry King directed two more R-C films with Pauline Frederick, also in 1921: Salvage and The Sting of the Lash.For a description of the former, see the review in Variety, June 17, 1921. For descriptions of the latter, see the reviews in Harrison's Reports (October 1, 1921) and Variety (October 21, 1921). Tod Browning directed two Gothic Pictures specials in 1924 starring Evelyn Brent: The Dangerous Flirt and Silk Stocking Sal.For a brief description of the former, see Sullivan (1986), p. 60. For a description of the latter, see Langman (1998), p. 88. From 1921 to 1924, William Seiter directed a half-dozen FBO releases, some produced directly for the studio, others independently. Between 1922 and 1926, Emory Johnson produced and directed at least eight films for FBO. Historian William K. Everson has pointed to Seiter and Johnson as two of the overlooked directorial talents of the silent era.Everson (1998), p. 142. Screenwriter Frances Marion, who would win two Oscars in the 1930s, penned ten of the FBO pictures starring her husband, Fred Thomson. Editor Pandro S. Berman, son of a major FBO stockholder, cut his first film for the studio at the age of twenty- two; he would go on to renown as an RKO producer and production chief. Famed RKO costume designer Walter Plunkett was also an FBO graduate. Notes Sources *Beauchamp, Cari (1998).

Born in Dallas, Texas in 1939, Graves was graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1957 and attended Texas A&M; University. He went to New York in 1958 and received a BA and MA from Goddard College. With Manhattan as his base, he pursued an extraordinary range of interests. Graves taught at Parsons School of Design and was a professor of Fine Arts at Fairleigh Dickinson University. He participated in many solo and group exhibitions, received numerous grants, awards, and critical recognition from many admirers. He was married to Verna Gillis for thirty-four years. Bradford Graves Sculpture Park opened May 2010 in Kerhonkson, New York. Reviews and quotes An example of Graves's work \\"...The compositional schemes balance masses in a way that expresses tension between the forces of growth and gravity‚Ä¶.I remember his past shows as being primarily of carved stone sculptures of pronounced archaic or totemic character.\\" --Edward J. Sozanski, The Philadelphia Inquirer, June 3, 2005 \\"The limestone carvings of Bradford Graves are a celebration of profound perplexity and mystery. They explain themselves neither quickly nor easily. Instead, they invite deliberately paced intellectual search and spiritual speculation...Stimulating the exercise of imagination, the sculptures challenge to invent their own relevant meanings...these silent pieces of chiseled rock plumb the sublime. In their unique way they illuminate mystical depths...there is a growing coterie of admirers able to appreciate the majesty implicit in Graves‚Äô language of form.\\" --Burton Wasserman, Art Matters, May 1996 \\"Bradford Graves is an original and ingenious form maker....Graves‚Äô display, one of the most striking and profound sculpture solo exhibitions in Philadelphia in recent years, presents a profusion of abstract shapes that seem to well up from the artists imagination as in natural growth.\\" --Victoria Donohoe, The Philadelphia Inquirer, March 11, 1989 \\"Bradford Graves‚Äô sculpture is complex. We see carved limestone slabs that look like the ruins of ancient walls. In front of them are horizontal pieces of limestone grooved in a geometrical pattern. One senses obscure, mystical meaning which is moving...Graves‚Äô work is difficult to describe but very much worth seeing...Graves is a sculptor worth following. His work is original and very interesting indeed, and the Thorpe Gallery is much to be commended for showing such radical, yet resolutely untrendy work.\\" --John Caldwell, The New York Times, March 8, 1981 \\"Two unusually accomplished artists are now on view. Especially impressive is Bradford Graves, a sculptor who works imaginatively in limestone. Graves seems to be creating modest-sized monuments...his work is most effective when they create the impression of almost natural elements such as one might find, perhaps, in a Surreal seaside landscape.\\" --James R. Mellow, The New York Times, May 19, 1973 \\"Another fine display of sculpture may be seen at Georgetown University‚Äôs Inter-Cultural Center and features the work of New York sculptor Bradford Graves...More so than with the work of many modern sculptors, the viewer must rely on his intuition to interpret his pieces...In sum, Mr. Graves‚Äô sculpture is enigmatic. It unites the twin themes of natural organic development and human- imposed structure. It succeeds. The success of this synthesis occurs on a strictly subliminal level: and it‚Äôs good that it does because it keeps one thinking, questioning.\\" --Michael Weizenbach, The Washington Times, May 1, 1986 \\"Art galleries no longer show much carved stone sculpture which makes the show by Bradford Graves something of an anomaly. He wants it to say stone in the traditional sense, but he also tries to make it a vehicle for contemporary sculptural language. This results in work that looks a bit other worldly, as if it had dropped in from another planet....The sculptures look archaic, like archeological artifacts. On the other hand their abstraction is organic and totally contemporary which sets up a rather vigorous clash of sensations. ...Either way, it gets your attention.\\" --The Philadelphia Inquirer, April 9, 1993 \\"Bradford Graves sustains the greatest amount of interest through his low-keyed and highly evocative works of profound originality....His work combines pallid, subtly textured rock with water that rests in a track-like indentation that runs down the length of limestone. The elements slowly fuse....In other works Graves evokes his haunting rhythms, stimulating quiet contemplation of his most unusual and visionary gems of sculpture.\\" --Barbara Cavaliere, arts magazine,\\" September 1978 \\"An unusually accomplished artist is now on view in the museums‚Äô galleries. Bradford Graves works imaginatively in limestone, sometimes smoothing it into seemingly weather, slab-like shapes, sometimes breaking it up into smallish, gravel-like chunks, and sometimes even stringing it together with strands of rope. Graves‚Äô works are most effective when they create the impression of almost natural elements such as one might find, perhaps, in a Surreal seaside landscape.\\" --Elizabeth Steves, The New York Times, May 19, 1973 Personal philosophy about sculpture ‚ÄúThe making of sculpture may be taken as a desire for wholeness: The recognition of one‚Äôs identity as part of the earth and its materials. In the confrontation of one‚Äôs inner image with physical materials, a dialogue begins and the result is a sculptural statement. Through this dialogue an attempt is made to clarify subject and object matter. The subject matter is the discovery, and not how much I know as I fabricate the sculpture. The object matter is the myriad of personal preconceptions that we transfer on to materials. People, cultures, other objects, past events - All become the excess baggage of symbols carried around with us. become the basis of abstract object art. Out of this confrontation, what we look for is the art of ‚ÄúThe real.‚Äù The real is the dialogue between fabricator and his materials, not a dialogue with oneself. One wants to touch, walk the earth, and create a place for events. The material I have chosen to have a working dialogue with is stone. Stone, one of the oldest sculptural materials, not to be confused with its architectural use, has been limited by its outer boundaries, the monolithic block. I have attempted to overcome this by utilizing work methods derived from constructivism, the pitting together of separate blocks allowing space to become an active part of the sculpture. This is a unifying method of working that allows each unit of my sculptures to create its own reasons for existence. The process is analogous to crystallization. First there is the idea, the basis of an internal ordering of structure, expanded or split into different units. From this, the resulting segmentation of a conceptual idea through physical units hints at the crystallization. They become like stars in the night sky, each defined by its own space, but perceived together they make up the fabric of a universe.‚Äù --Bradford Graves.

It is located in the historic centre of the city, declared World Heritage Site by UNESCO. History The Franciscan Order was established in Porto around 1223. Initially, the order was antagonised by the secular and clergy of other religious institutions, particularly by the bishop of Porto. It took a papal bull, the Bulla Doelentis accepimus by Pope Innocent V, to restore to the Franciscans the plot of land previously donated to them. They began building the convent and a first, small church dedicated to Saint Francis of Assisi around 1244. In 1383, under the patronage of King Ferdinand I, the Franciscans began to build a more spacious church. This new structure was finished around 1425 and followed a relatively plain Gothic design, typical for the mendicant orders in Portugal. The general structure of the church has not been extensively altered, making S√£o Francisco the best example of Gothic architecture in Porto. Baroque main portal and Gothic rose window of the main fa√ßade. During the 15th and 16th centuries, prominent Porto families chose the Franciscan for their pantheon. The Chapel of St John the Baptist is a notable example, built in the 1530s for the Carneiro family in Manueline style, the Portuguese late Gothic. The main artistic campaign of the church was carried out in the first half of the 18th century, when most of the surfaces of the interior of the church, including walls, pillars, side chapels and roof, were covered with Portuguese gilt wood work (talha dourada) in Baroque style. Particularly notable are the many Baroque altarpieces of the apse chapels and the nave, which are among the best in Portugal. A fire, caused by the siege of Porto in 1832, destroyed the old cloisters. In its place, the Commercial Association of the city built the Stock Exchange Palace (Pal√°cio da Bolsa), a magnificent example of 19th century Neoclassical architecture. Art Exterior and floorplan The main fa√ßade of the Franciscan church has a large, elaborate rose window in Gothic style. This is the only original decoration of the main fa√ßade. The West portal is now a typical Baroque work, organised in two tiers, with solomonic columns and a statue of St Francis. The South portal, facing the river, is still Gothic. The portal is stepped forward from the facade and has a triangular gable decorated with a pentagram. The opening is composed of a series of Gothic archivolts; the inner moulding is decorated with an arcade relief of Mud√©jar (Islamic influenced) design. Inner view of the Church of S√£o Francisco, towards the main chapel. The church has a nave with three aisles, with the central aisle being the highest. The East end of the church has a transept and an apse with three chapels. The crossing area is illuminated by the large windows of the transept arms and main chapel, as well as by a small rose window over the main chapel with tracery in the shape of a pentagram. Interior A polychrome granite statue (13th century) of Saint Francis of Assisi, standing inside the church next to the entrance within a Baroque altarpiece, is a remnant of the first St Francis church, replaced after 1383 by the present structure. During the 15th and 16th centuries several noble families chose St Francis as their pantheon. Near the entrance is located the old pantheon for the family of Lu√≠s √Ålvares de Sousa, with an interesting Gothic portal decorated with a coat-of-arms and a dedicatory inscription. The chapel is nowadays occupied by a Baroque altarpiece. Another interesting chapel is the one dedicated to Saint John the Baptist (S√£o Jo√£o Baptista), built around 1534 in the right transept arm for the family of Jo√£o Carneiro. This chapel, by architect Diogo de Castilho, has a beautiful portal and is covered with an intricate rib vaulting in Manueline style. The Baroque altarpiece of the chapel still has the 16th-century painting, representing the Baptism of Christ, incorporated into a Baroque altarpiece. From the same period, the church also has a fine Renaissance tomb, imbedded onto a wall. Inner view of the Church of S√£o Francisco showing the gilt woodwork of altarpieces, ceiling and columns. In the early 18th century the lateral aisles and apse chapels were extensively decorated with exuberant gilt wood work (talha dourada) by several Portuguese wood carvers. This decorative richness is the most notable feature of the Franciscan church, covering almost completely the roofs of the aisles, pillars, window frames and chapels and hiding the underlying mediaeval architecture. Even though the Baroque gilt work does not completely harmonise with the Gothic structure of the church, it is considered one of the most outstanding of Portugal. Among the altarpieces, particularly important is the one that depicts the \\"Tree of Jesse\\" on the North lateral aisle. This polychromed woodwork was carved by Filipe da Silva and Ant√≥nio Gomes, as stated in a contract of 1718. It represents a family tree of Jesus with twelve kings of Judah connected through branches of the tree to the recumbent body of Jesse. On the top of the tree is Joseph, under an image of the Virgin and the Child. The niches flanking this tree contain statues of St. Anne and St. Joachim (father and mother of Maria) and four Franciscan doctors who wrote about the Immaculate Conception. Another notable example of gilt wood decoration in Porto is the interior of the Santa Clara Church. The facade of the church is flanked by interesting monuments like the 18th century, Neoclassical Church of the Ordem Terceira de S√£o Francisco and the Dispatch House of the Order (Casa de Despachos), which houses a museum and has an interesting Baroque interior.

Foundation Soundscape, was founded as a jazz club in New York City in 1979 by Verna Gillis, a Ph.D. in ethnomusicology. Committed to the ideals of multiculturalism, it aimed to present contemporary music and musicians from diverse cultural backgrounds. It provided one of the first multi-cultural performance spaces in New York City. Live in Soundscape is a 9-CD series on DIW which documents the early years, through 1984. Multiple venues After 1984, Soundscape no longer operated out of just one location. Other venues used included the Purple Barge on the Hudson River, the Miller Pier, the Ritz rock club, La Mama, the Village Gate, Irving Plaza, SOB's, Symphony Space, Alice Tully Hall, Town Hall and the Beacon Theatre. WKCR 89.8 fm (New York) has launched a webpage devoted to Soundscape, including documentation, recordings and photographs. * As a performance space, Soundscape brought together all musics, regardless of genre. It provided an environment that encouraged experimentation, development, and cultural fusions. It presented both established, well-known musicians and emerging composer/musicians of exceptional promise. Established musicians found a rare environment in which they were encouraged to try out new ideas without commercial pressures, while emerging musicians were given a forum with a reputation for quality and visibility. Many musicians performed and were reviewed for the first time at Soundscape, and have gone on to make significant contributions to contemporary music. In November, 1981, Soundscape produced Interpretations of Monk in two concerts at Columbia University. Eleven major performers and interpreters of Thelonious Monk‚Äôs music performed together in different configurations. These momentous performances were taped by National Public Radio and broadcast nationwide, and released in 1994 on DIW. In 1981 and 1982, Soundscape produced summer concert series at the Hudson River Museum; it produced Soundscape Presents Latin New York in 1982 at the Berlin Jazz Festival; and it produced six successful seasons of Latin Jazz for the Center for Inter American Relations, 1982-1987. Soundscape became the first U.S. presenter of African pop music with the appearance of King Sunny Ad√© and his African Beats from Nigeria in early 1983, which was heralded as ‚Äúthe pop event of the decade‚Äù by Robert Palmer of The New York Times.* Late that same year, Soundscape produced the first Hip-Hop performance, ‚ÄúDance Music New York,‚Äù at the Miller Pier. From 1980 to 1985, Soundscape produced the New Music component of the Kool Jazz Festival and produced a World Pop series for The First New York International Festival of the Arts in 1988. The New York Festival presented talent from India, Japan, and three African countries with performances at The Felt Forum and the Beacon Theatre. In 1991, once again for the New York International Festival of the Arts premiered two groups from Brazil - Paulinho da Viola and Olodum, as well as ‚ÄúLights in a Fat City.‚Äù Soundscape Presents serves as a consultant to festivals and organizations around the world, assisting in the production of concerts and concert series, and developing concepts for their music programming. Record label In 1986 Soundscape formed its own record label and to date has released two albums by the group Vortex. The first record, C Album, was voted one of the 10 best of the year in 1986 by Cadence Magazine. Two other Soundscape recordings have been licensed to Island Records - the first, Arawe by Daniel Ponce, was released in 1987, and Funky Jibaro by Yomo Toro was released in 1988.

She served as a commissioned ship for 16 months. Corvus (AKA-26) was launched 24 September 1944 by Walsh-Kaiser Co., Inc., Providence, R.I., under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. O. Parks; acquired by the Navy 20 November 1944; and commissioned the same day, Lieutenant Commander C. M. Gregson, USNR, in command. Service history Corvus departed Providence 2 December 1944 for San Francisco, where she loaded cargo for Leyte. Arriving in the Philippines 21 February 1945, Corvus discharged cargo at Guiuan for the establishment of an air base there, and transferred cargo at Dulag. On 13 March she began rehearsals for the Okinawa operation, and sailed from Leyte Gulf 27 March for the landings 1 April. She remained off Okinawa undergoing the first of the kamikaze attacks, until 10 April when she sailed with Army casualties for Guam, arriving 14 April. Corvus then sailed for Pearl Harbor where, according to a crew member oral history,http://www.vets- hall.org/stories/world-war-ii/harris-lee-stillwell new engines were installed. Corvus then returned to the West Coast for overhaul, and loaded Army men and supplies at Seattle sailing 15 June for Tinian, where she arrived 3 July. Cargo was said to have been parts to load F31, Fat Man assembly parts to load Fat Man onto aircraft named Bockscar to drop bomb on Nagasaki, Japan. Project Alberta was name of the operation and Bockscar the aircraft that dropped the assembled bomb. Corvus sailed from Tinian 7 July 1945 carrying cargo for Guadalcanal, the Russell Islands, Samar, and Manus, and reported to Manila 30 August. She loaded cargo and occupation troops, and sailed 18 September for Honsh≈´. Returning to Manila 14 October, she sailed a week later to embark homeward-bound servicemen at Yokohama returning to San Pedro, Calif., with them 26 November. Between 26 December and 10 February, she made a similar voyage from the west coast to Guam, then sailed 16 February for Mobile, Alabama, and Orange, Texas. Corvus was decommissioned 29 March 1946, and transferred to the Maritime Commission 31 October 1946 for disposal. Corvus received one battle star in World War II. The ship's sailors kept many of the logs. During their reunion in 1995, they compiled the logs that told the story. It was said there were over 80 plain clothed project managers (Army civilians) on board the Corvus. Low clearance sailors asked what those personnel were doing on board and what was in the un-marked boxes they were carrying. It was very uncharacteristic to carry so many personnel, let alone civilians, on an attack cargo ship. The ship's captain said he could not tell anyone anything beyond the fact that because of the cargo they were carrying, World War II would be over two weeks after they were to have arrived on Tinian Island. Most of the lower clearance sailors were excessively promoted to keep their curiosity at bay.

It was carried on Time Warner Cable systems in the Capital District of New York and that area's suburbs including Saratoga County, the southern Adirondack region, the Mohawk Valley, and most of Berkshire County, Massachusetts. TW3 was formed in October 2002 as the improved successor to Time Warner 9, a similar station that was succeeded on the Time Warner lineup by sister station Capital News 9 and taking over the channel 3 position which had been pay-per-view previews. On most of Time Warner's Albany-area systems, TW3 occupied the channel 3 position though there were several exceptions, namely former Adelphia systems or systems where an \\"actual\\" channel 3 (WCAX in Burlington, Vermont or WFSB in Hartford, Connecticut) has that channel position. Those systems are: *Pittsfield, Massachusetts: Channel 11 *Ticonderoga, New York (Port Henry/Crown Point) and Schroon Lake, New York: Channel 14 *North Adams, Massachusetts (ex-Adelphia): Channel 21 *Canajoharie, New York, Queensbury, New York, and Lee, Massachusetts (Lenox/Great Barrington) (all ex-Adelphia): Channel 96 It was never an over the air station, just a program source carried by Time Warner. Programming Much of TW3's programming was locally originated. The more notable series produced for the station were as follows: *A simulcast of WAMC's The Round Table (Weekdays 9 a.m.‚Äìnoon) *Saints Alive: A magazine show profiling Siena College athletics, hosted by Capital News 9 sports director Damian Andrew. *Hoop Games: A magazine show on University at Albany men's and women's basketball, hosted by UAlbany broadcaster and WNYT sports director Rodger Wyland. *Masterminds: A College Bowl formatted quiz show produced in conjunction with BOCES. *Tech Valley Report: A local business program focusing on the technology sector, produced in part with the Albany- Colonie Chamber of Commerce. *In & Around Our Towns: A series of insertials that profile aspects of area towns which also airs as a monthly program. *Capital Tonight: TW3 airs replays of the week-in-review version of the Capital News 9-produced nightly political program. This arrangement dates back to when the show was a weekly program. TW3 also served as the Albany-area affiliate of the SUNY-owned New York Network, the Educational-access television programming of which aired mostly during daytime hours though their Regents review specials often end up in primetime. Sports coverage TW3 produces and airs a sizeable slate of local sports coverage including high school athletics (football, basketball, baseball, and lacrosse), UAlbany and Siena athletics, Albany Devils hockey, Union College men's hockey and RPI Men's Hockey. Regionally and beyond, TW3 was the Albany affiliate for ESPN Plus coverage of Big East football and basketball as well as America East Conference network coverage alongside their UAlbany rights. New Jersey Nets games which are seen on WWOR in New York City air on TW3 as well. It also airs New York Yankees games that do not air on ESPN or are not picked up by WXXA from New York City based channel WWOR-TV. Outside of the Albany area, some TW3 sports programming is simulcast or rebroadcast on Time Warner Cable Sports. Preemptions The station picks up several preempted programs from local broadcast stations that are unable to air them: *In 2005 and 2006, CBS' Labor Day coverage of US Open Tennis aired on TW3 when WRGB aired the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon and the WRGB-controlled WNYA was unavailable due to new syndication debuts on that date. *Limited WMHT programming (namely the PBS Newshour) airs on TW3 at times when WMHT conducts their yearly auctions. *A small number of New York Yankees games that usually would air on WXXA (also originating from WWOR) air on TW3 in the cases of the Fox network airing either original programming or preseason NFL football. Time Warner 9 The predecessor to TW3, Time Warner 9, was on the air from 1997 (when Time Warner purchased the CVI and Cablevision systems in the market) until 2002. Originally, the channel was primarily a barker channel for the then-new services of digital cable and Road Runner plus a clearinghouse for overflow sports programming, most notably WWOR-produced New York Mets games. After Time Warner purchased the former TCI systems in Schenectady and Amsterdam in 1999, it evolved into a showcase for Time Warner's own programming as well as a home for local sports programming. Time Warner 9 was also the home for New York Yankees games in 1999 and from 2000 until 2002 aired a replay of WRGB's 6:00 p.m. newscast at 6:30 p.m., the success of which was a catalyst for the establishment of its replacement, Capital News 9.

Share of voice measures the percentage of media spending by a company compared to the total media expenditure for the product, service, or category in the market. For example, if an electronics brand were to invest $5,000,000 advertising their latest e-reader, but $100,000,000 worth of advertising was spent advertising e-readers across the entire category, the 5 million dollar investment would equal a 5% share of voice. Share of voice can be calculated by taking your advertising spend and dividing it by the total of all market advertising spend for the same type of product or category. Share of Voice is used to \\"represent the relative portion of ad inventory available to a single advertiser within a defined market over a specified time period.\\" Theory The goal of advertising is to make your target audience aware of your brand, product, or service and influence them to act. Therefore, having a high share of voice can lead to increased awareness, and ultimately, increased sales and market share. From the perspective of publishers and those selling ad space, Share of Voice capitalizes on the concept of exclusivity. By limiting the number of ad space available on websites, email newsletters, and other media, ads are more likely to be seen by their target audiences. When you limit a website, for example, to 10 advertisers in each ad position with each paying equally, on average each advertiser will be seen at least once every 10 rotations. Share of Voice is designed to create a mutually beneficial relationship between the advertiser and the web publisher. The advertiser is willing to pay a premium for exclusivity and less competition for their target audience's viewership. The publisher no longer has to rely on volume and can attract advertisers that want to specifically reach the publisher's audience. Because the Share of Voice method values quality of ads over quantity of ads, publishers are perceived to have higher levels of credibility and interaction. When high quality content is presented, high quality advertisers tend to follow. Benefits versus pay-for-performance models The share of voice advertising model is contrary to pay per click, cost per impression and/or pay to play (see brokered programming), which are pay-for-performance models that generate revenue for the publisher (typically, the website owner) only if the advertisement is clicked or viewed. The publisher is incentivized to seek out as many advertisers as possible, often on a bid-based system. Furthermore, Share of Voice bypasses the ethical dilemmas that come with PPC and CPI models, which are subject to abuse by click fraud, or Pay to Play tactics (advertorials, product placement, news coverage in exchange for ad purchases, etc) that are not always transparently paid ads. When content is compromised for ad dollars, the level of reputation and respect for the publisher can dwindle as readers become disenfranchised and advertisers see less return on their initial investment. Share of Voice models Share of Voice models can be contract models where ad placement and content are pre-negotiated. This way, advertisers have the option to have longer advertising campaigns where content does not need to change based on the availability of advertising space. Additionally, the publisher's non-ad content, i.e. in the case of a news publisher, is independent of the advertiser's marketing campaign, regardless of other sponsors or advertisers that work with the web publisher. Share of Voice can also be employed to maximize a brand or group of brands' exposure via advertising weight expressed as a percentage of a defined total market or market segment in a given time period. The weight is usually defined in terms of expenditure, ratings, pages, poster sites etc. References Advertising Audience measurement ","title":"Share of voice"},{"id":"6382801","text":"Verna Gillis (born 1942) is a free-lance producer who has gained recognition for her work promoting and producing music from various cultural backgrounds.

It has sold over a million copies and been translated into over a dozen languages, and has been included in university courses \\"ranging from history and anthropology to economics and geography.\\" In the book, Galeano analyzes the history of the Americas as a whole, from the time period of the European settlement of the New World to contemporary Latin America, describing the effects of European and later United States economic exploitation and political dominance over the region. The Library Journal review stated, \\"Well written and passionately stated, this is an intellectually honest and valuable study.\\"  Background  Galeano wrote Open Veins of Latin America in Uruguay while working as an independent journalist and editor and while employed in the publishing department of the University of the Republic. He said, \\"It took four years of researching and collecting the information I needed, and some 90 nights to write the book\\".\\"Writer Without Borders\\" July 14, 2006 In These Times Shortly after the publication of Open Veins, in 1973, a military junta took power in Uruguay, forcing Galeano into exile; for its left-wing perspective the book was banned under the right- wing military governments of Brazil, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay.  Cultural and political significance  In the foreword to the 1997 edition, Isabel Allende stated that \\"after the military coup of 1973 I could not take much with me: some clothes, family pictures, a small bag of dirt from my garden, and two books: an old edition of the Odes by Pablo Neruda and the book with the yellow cover, Las venas abiertas de Am√©rica Latina\\".Allende, Isabel.

In 2014, at an event in Brazil honoring him on the 43rd anniversary of the book's publication, Galeano said he no longer felt so connected to it. He said he was not sorry he had written it, but he had lacked the necessary development to write a book on political economy at that stage and criticized the book's prose as \\"extremely boring\\". This was often interpreted in the media as a renunciation of the book. However, when interrogated about the media reaction which followed the event in Brazil, Galeano remarked, > It's proof that writing is good for something, at least for inspiring > celebration and protest, applause and also indignation. The book, written > ages ago, is still alive and kicking.

History  Ray Christopher, associated with the GT Development firm, which was notable for building accurate replicas of Ford GT40 envisioned his own version of the GT40 of the 1990s. The R42 was the modern reincarnation of the GT40 and had similar layout, proportions and updated monocoque construction. The name R42 paid homage to the original GT40 (the height of the GT40 was 42 inches and R was the a breviation for the designer's first name Ray). The design incorporated elements from the famous sports cars of the time such as the Lamborghini Countach, the Jaguar XJR-15 and the Ferrari 288 GTO. The coefficient of drag of was considered the best in its class. Ray's original intention was to create an endurance racing car which could emerge victorious at LeMans, just like the GT40. In order to achieve this feat, a limited number of road going examples of the car were required to be produced in order for the car to be homologated for racing. Development of the car began in late 1992 and a scale model was built for wind testing along with a running prototype. The R42 was first shown at the 1993 London Motor Show held in October. Unfortunately, the company went into receivership due to high development costs of the car and ongoing economic recession.British Specialty Cars - Spectre R42 A take-over by the American company Spectre Motors Inc. led by GT Development's former sales agent Anders Hildebrand in March 1995, brightened the possibility of the R42 going into production. Anders brought the rights of the car for US$2.5 million and put it into production just four months later at a 12,000 sq. ft.production facility in Poole, a small town located in Dorset, England. Each car took 2,000 man hours to manufacture. Anders reorganized production, brought in investors and involved Derek Bell as chairman and development consultant. He also launched the ALCO-Spectre racing programme, resulting in the development of the R42 GTR, the racing variant of the R42. The company sold the R42 for GB¬£70,000 each and only managed to sell 23 cars with most of the cars destined to Switzerland. Quality issues would suffice and the choice of fibreglass over the originally planned carbon fibre along with poor fit and finish resulted in negative reviews. The automotive press also reprimanded the practice of borrowing parts from other cars for an expensive sports car (the R42 utilised the Toyota MR2's front indicators and door handles; Honda Legend's tail lamps and interior parts from the Ford Fiesta) along with the controversial rear design which incorporated a lot of cooling vents. Anders then aimed to replace the R42 with a more potent R45. Two prototypes were developed and the second prototype (finished in yellow colour) was presented at the 1997 London Motor Show by actor Desmond Llewellyn with the production version scheduled to debut at the 1998 London Motor Show but the absence of sufficient funds for the car's development and other losses led the company into receivership.  Specifications and performance  The chassis of the car consists of an aluminium honeycomb monocoque and a tubular steel space frame. The car has a fibreglass body, which gave it the final weight of around . The R42 utilised an all-aluminium 4.6-litre (281 cubic inches) Ford V8 engine (shared with the Mustang Cobra with 4 valves per cylinder which generates and of torque allowing the car to accelerate to from a standstill in 4.5 seconds and on to a top speed of . The engine was mated to a 5-speed manual transmission having a Getrag transaxle with a 6-speed transmission available as an option. The car had a weight distribution of 42% at the front and 58% at the rear because of the mid-mounted engine. The 17-inch OZ racing alloy wheels wrapped in tyres measuring 235/45 ZR17 at the front and 335/35 ZR17 at the rear provided optimum grip. The race-style independent suspension consisted of adjustable anti-roll bars at the rear, inverted wishbones, parallel radius rods, anti-roll bars; rising-rate coil springs and adjustable Spax gas telescopic dampers at the front and the rear respectively. The brakes were made by AP racing with vented discs front and aft along with four piston callipers at the front and rear and had servo-motor assistance. The interior of the R42 had Walnut wood trim and Wilton carpets. Some of the elements of the interior were borrowed from the Ford Fiesta (such as air conditioning vents, starter motor etc.). The interior had anti-glare Alcantara combined with the leather upholstery and custom made gauges with the speed-o-meter reading . The leather sports seats and pedals were adjustable to customer's specifications. Some complaints surfaced about the interior not having enough headroom. Visibility was considered to be good compared to other mid-engined sports cars of the time.  R42 GTR  The R42 GTR is the racing variant of the R42. Introduced at the 1996 London Motor Show under the ALCO- Spectre racing programme, the car was built under FIA regulations to compete in the BRDG GT racing series and the 24 Hours of LeMans. The 4.6-litre V8 engine used in the road car was modified to generate a power output of and was mated to a 6-speed sequential manual transmission. The car weighed a total of . Despite being scheduled to compete at the 1997 24 Hours of LeMans, financial troubles among the company forced them to abandon the project and the car never went racing.  Other media  The R42 had a starring role in the 1997 Ian Sharp film \\"RPM\\" where it plays the prototype eco-friendly sports car that leading actor David Arquette has to steal. The R42 also made an appearance in the 1998 racing game Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit as a downloadable car.

Mrs. Georgina Allan Lepsch, gave her date of birth as 6 March 1910 on her U.S. Petition for Naturalization, #227616, dated 14 May 1934.), where she was raised. She began performing under the name Ella Allan as a child.\\"Swing when you're Scottish\\", Heritage.scotsman.com; accessed 27 May 2017. Career She went on to become a band singer in music halls. Aged 20, she made her debut in 1930 in the West End of London in Darling! I Love You. She toured Europe in the early 1930s. Logan eventually emigrated to the U.S. and began to sing at various clubs and to record jazz on the British Columbia label (part of EMI). She then appeared in several Hollywood films, including Flying Hostess (1936), 52nd Street (1937) and The Goldwyn Follies (1938). She appeared in several Broadway shows in the 1930s and early 1940s, but traveled to Europe and then Africa during World War II to entertain the troops. She also appeared on The Ed Wynn Show and The Colgate Comedy Hour in the 1940s and 1950s. Logan returned to Broadway in 1947 starring as Sharon McLonergan in the original production of Finian's Rainbow, singing the show's most famous song, \\"How Are Things in Glocca Morra?\\", among others. The production ran for 725 performances. She did not return to Broadway after that. In 1954, she was cast in a proposed animated film adaptation of Finian's Rainbow and re-recorded the score with Frank Sinatra. But the film was canceled, and the recordings were not released until the 2002 box set Sinatra in Hollywood 1940-1964. The original cast album was released in 1948, and was Columbia Records' first Original Cast album. She recorded the show's songs for a second time in 1954 for the LP Ella Logan Sings Favorites from Finian's Rainbow, accompanied by pianist George Greeley. It was released by Capitol Records in 1955, (H-561 in the US, and L-561 in Australia). This was the second of her two solo albums. Logan's career was hampered by the FBI, who suspected Logan of having communist ties but never found any evidence to support such allegations. The FBI kept a file on her from 1945 until 1961, placed her Los Angeles house under surveillance, and monitored her activities and travels, which resulted in being searched while traveling to New York, due to suspicions she was a ‚ÄúRussian courier agent.‚Äù Due to John J. Huber's Senate Judiciary Committee testimony of 1950, Logan was listed as a Communist sympathizer in Red Channels. In the 1950s, she became an international nightclub performer, appearing at such venues as the Copacabana and the Waldorf-Astoria in New York as well as in London and Paris. She appeared on television in May 1956, in London with Louis Armstrong and His All-Stars. In 1965 she was part of the cast of the infamous Broadway flop, Kelly, until her role was cut during out of town tryouts. She continued to work occasionally in clubs, on television, and in theatrical stock productions, into the 1960s.Ella Logan profile, IBDb.com; accessed 27 December 2015.

It first aired on 1 December 1970. Eric Praline (John Cleese) is a put-upon customer who seeks to obtain a licence for his pet halibut, Eric, although he has difficulty explaining to the clerk (Michael Palin) how all pets should be licensed. The clerk repeatedly calls Praline a \\"loony\\", to which Praline angrily replies by naming famous people who kept odd pets.All the Words: Volume One. pp. 316-318. Praline even produces \\"a dog licence with the word 'dog' crossed out and 'cat' written in crayon\\", and explains that the man in the \\"Ministry of Housinge\\" cat detector van (a parody of the TV detector van) didn't have the right form. All in all, the pets Praline mentions are: *Eric the fish (an halibut) *Eric the dog *Eric the cat *Eric the fruit bat *Eric the Half Bee (in the version from Monty Python's Previous Record) In response to the clerk's assurance that there is no such thing as (and no need for) a fish licence, Praline requests a statement to that fact signed by the Lord Mayor. The superhumanly tall Lord Mayor (Graham Chapman), with full regalia and city council entourage, enters the office and hands a thunderstuck Praline the signed statement. An announcer (also Cleese) reverently narrates the exchange, ending by saying that Praline has \\"gone spare\\". The sketch then segues to the Lord Mayor and city council members playing a rugby match against the New Zealand All Blacks. In the version of the sketch on Monty Python's Previous Record, instead of asking for a statement from the Lord Mayor, Praline asks for a bee licence, which leads to the song \\"Eric the Half- a-Bee\\".  Trivia  * This is one of the three appearances by Eric Praline. The other two are the Dead Parrot sketch and an appearance as a link the 5th episode of the second series, \\"Live from the Grill-o-Mat\\", where he announces he will appear later in the show. He then comes in a few minutes as Inspector Praline in the Crunchy Frog sketch. * OpenBSD's 3.5 release contained a parody track of both the Fish Licence sketch and the song \\"Eric the Half a Bee\\", titled \\"CARP Licence and Redundancy Must Be Free\\".

On some tracks, one gets the impression that Lee got bored with some of the complacent arrangements and shows her indifference by having a bit of fun using overly broad vowel pronunciations on such tunes as \\"Pretty Eyes.\\" But on the better stuff, such as the swinging \\"It Could Happen to You,\\" \\"Too Close for Comfort,\\" and \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\" done as a slow ballad, she holds nothing back.

Camp history In 1939, before it was a POW camp, the area was originally planned to be an airfield. The POW camp was opened in September 1940. At first French, and then British officers were housed there. The serial escaper Eric Foster in his autobiography explained that upon arrival he chatted to a guard to ask about the conditions of the camp. Foster explained the guard confided, ‚Äúthe camp was a very, very bad camp indeed.‚Äù Foster stressed that this guard desperately wanted the prisoners to complain about the conditions, with the guard believing that if they harassed the camp command about the conditions, the camp would be closed down. The guard, who wanted an easier posting also stated to Foster, ‚ÄúWe are prisoners as much as you are.‚Äù Foster explained the prisoners were housed in huts which held 50 to 60 men. In 1941, all lighting was provided by two acetylene lamps in each barrack. though later on electric lighting was provided. Eric Foster who was captured in June 1940 and up to 1942 had served time in Dulag Luft, Spangenberg, Torun and now Warburg, made observations about camp life. He observed three types of prisoner of war inside Warburg: the Zizzer, who would be a prisoner who was happy-go-lucky; the studious type, who was always concerned he was being left behind at home and who would be catered for by the Red Cross with study classes and examinations up to first year university standard; and the escapist, which included people like himself and his friend the Polish officer Danny Krol who was described as generous and a great gambler. Krol would later be executed at Stalag Luft III. Sometimes the studious type could also be an escapist. Amongst these types was also a sprinkling of the POW Warburg eccentrics. A case study being Foster's friend F/O McHardy, who was an officer known by his comrades as ‚ÄòFou.‚Äô Fou was an artist and lived in a room at the end of Fosters hut with two other artists. They constantly challenged what was standardised. They chose to sit on the floor whilst eating meals. They went by a time system that was two hours ahead of the camps time. This time system had an advantage, in that they would find the camp stove to themselves at eating times. They also had a pet mouse called Freddie, which ate alongside them with its own bowl. In a peculiarity they had a court-martial for the mouse, after the mouse got caught stealing their food. Fou would go on to captivate and hoax an audience with a lecture about a non existent German professor‚Äôs Calculus. The camp was the setting for two remarkable escape attempts. On 1 December 1941 Flt Lt Peter Stevens RAFVR, disguised as a German Unteroffizier, led a party of 10 POWs disguised as orderlies, and two more disguised as guards complete with dummy rifles, up to the gates of the camp. The sentry was not satisfied with their gate pass, so Stevens marched his party back into the camp. As the sentry was apparently unaware that the party was not genuine, a second attempt was made a week later. This time the sentry demanded to see their Army paybooks, so the escape party fled, although two, Pete Tunstall and Dominic Bruce were eventually arrested after a camp search by Major Rademacher found a piece of cloth on them that was used to create the sentry uniforms. On 30 August 1942 the camp was the scene of \\"Operation Olympia\\", also known as the \\"Warburg Wire Job\\", another mass escape attempt. After RAOC officer Major B.D. Skelton (\\"Skelly\\") Ginn fused the perimeter floodlights, 41 prisoners carrying four scaling ladders made from bed slats rushed to the barbed-wire fence and clambered over. One ladder collapsed, so of the 41 involved, only 28 escaped the camp, and only three of those made it home. In September 1942 the British prisoners were transferred to other camps, and were replaced with Polish officers, with 1,077 brought from Romania, where they had been interned since September 1939, and another 1,500 transferred from other camps in Germany. At various points in time up to 2296 officers and 287 non-commissioned officers were housed in the camp. The British had begun an escape tunnel, and the Poles continued working on it, and on 20 September 1943, 47 of them escaped. Within four days, 20 had been captured and returned to the camp. They were then transported to the Buchenwald concentration camp and executed. In the next few days 17 more were captured and taken to the Gestapo prison in Dortmund where they were killed. Only 10 managed to remain free, some returning to Poland, others finding their way to the Allied lines. British prisoners were taught by one officer, Major Alexis Casdagli, to sew with unravelled jumpers and needles and threads from Red Cross parcels, and they made bookmarks or embroidered letters home with symbols of freedom such as butterflies. On the night of 27 September 1944 British aircraft attacking the nearby railroad junction in N√∂rde, dropped some bombs on the camp, killing 90 officers. Altogether 141 prisoners died in Oflag VI-B. They are buried in the cemetery near the centre of the village of Dossel. A memorial was erected there in 1985. The camp was liberated by the U.S. Army on 3 April 1945.

Jackson is the son of All Black Everard Jackson and the brother of Syd Jackson. He graduated in Law and Criminology at Victoria University of Wellington, and after a short period in practice took up the teaching of Maori language. He then undertook further study in the United States before returning to New Zealand to conduct research for the then Justice Department report on the Maori and the criminal justice system, He Whaipaanga Hou.

He has also worked extensively overseas on international indigenous issues, particularly the drafting of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. He was a judge on the International Tribunal of Indigenous Rights in Hawaii in 1993 and again in Canada in 1995. He was also counsel for the Bougainville Interim Government during the Bougainville peace process. Jackson was a vocal critic of the government's foreshore and seabed legislation in 2004. He was also a vocal critic of the October 2007 police 'terror' raids. He resigned as patron of the Police Recruit Wing 244 due to his opposition to how the raids were conducted saying \\"I do not buy that this was a racially-neutral act\\".

Contributions to Criminal Justice  Moana Jackson famously said that Maori people should have the opportunity for an alternative justice system in his groundbreaking work published in 1988. He said that the Maori experience must be seen on Maori terms, not forced onto preconceived notions of Pakeha (European) methodologies. Jackson criticized the Eurocentric approach to crime and its tendency to be an offender based methodology, where the offender is viewed as separate from the culture and society he grows up in. Jackson highlighted the importance of showing positive portrayals of Maori in the media, as the negative portrayal of Maori may damage their self-worth.

It is so named because its author appears to have been a Maronite. It survives today only in a single damaged 8th- or 9th-century manuscript in London, British Library Add. 17,216. Owing to the damage, portions of the chronicle are lost.Palmer, p. 29. The original Chronicle began with Creation and continued down to 664.Jan van Ginkel, \\"Maronite Chronicle of 663/4\\", in Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle, ed. Graeme Dunphy and Cristian Bratu (Brill, 2016). Consulted online on 16 November 2019. It was written shortly after this date, since the author writes that there was no Arab attack in a particular region after 664 up to the present.Palmer, p. xxx. The author shows the Maronites winning a debate with the Syrian Orthodox and is sympathetic to the Byzantines, whose victories over Abd al-Rahman ibn Khalid in Anatolia it dutifully reports. He must have been writing before the Council in Trullo (680), when the Maronites broke with the pro-Byzantine Melkites. The beginning of the chronicle is lost; the surviving text begins with Alexander the Great. The part covering the late fourth century through the mid-seventh is also lost, but the last part from 658 on survives.Hoyland, pp. 135‚Äì139. It is the only Syriac chronicle to cover the years 660‚Äì664.Palmer, p. xxv. It correctly names the days of week for particular dates, suggesting that many of its passages written shortly after the events. The Maronite Chronicle provides some unique information on the early Umayyad Caliphate. In general it favours the Umayyad Muawiyah over the Caliph Ali in the First Arab Civil War. It is the earliest source to record the Islamic battle cry, \\"God is great\\". It reports with disdain the Syrian Orthodox had accepted the status of dhimma and paid the jizya. It is also the only literary witness to Muawiyah's minting of gold and silver coin, which now has some archaeological confirmation. Excerpts *AG 969 [658 CE] ...Mu'awiya, Hudhayfa, his sister's son, and Mu'awiya gave orders that he be put to death. 'Ali, too, threatened to go up once again against Mu'awiya, but they struck him while he was at prayer in al-Hira and killed him. Mu'awiya then went down to al-Hira where all the Arab forces proffered their right hands to him, whereupon he returned to Damascus. *AG 970 [June 659] [There was an earthquake in Palestine.] In the same month the bishops of the Jacobites ‚Äî Theodore and Sabukht ‚Äî came to Damascus and held an inquiry into the Faith with the Maronites in the presence of Mu'awiya. When the Jacobites were defeated, Mu'awiya ordered them to pay 20,000 denarii and commanded them to be silent. Thus there arose the custom that the Jacobite bishops should pay that sum of gold every year to Mu'awiya, so that he would not withdraw his protection [lit. \\"loose his hand upon them\\"] and let them be persecuted by the members of the Church. The person called \\"Patriarch\\" by the Jacobites fixed the financial burden that all the converts of monks and nuns should contribute each year to the payment in gold and he did the same with all the adherents of his faith. He bequeathed his estate to Mu'awiya so that out of fear of that man all the Jacobites would be obedient to him. [There was another earthquake.] *AG 971 [660] many Arabs gathered at Jerusalem and made Mu'awiya king and he went up and sat down on Golgotha; he prayed there and went to Gethsemane and went down to the tomb of the blessed Mary to pray in it. In those days when the Arabs were gathered there with Mu'awiya, there was an earthquake. [Much of Jericho fell, as well as many nearby churches and monasteries.] In July of the same year the emirs and many Arabs gathered and gave their allegiance to Mu'awiya. Then an order went out that he should be proclaimed king in all the villages and cities of his dominion and that they should make acclamations and invocations to him. Mu'awiya also minted gold and silver, but it was not accepted because there was no cross on it. Furthermore Mu'awiya did not wear a crown like other kings in the world. He placed his throne in Damascus and refused to go to Muhammad's throne. *AG 972 [661] ... When Mu'awiya had acquired the power to which he had aimed and was at peace from the wars of his people, he broke the pact with the Romans and refused to accept peace from them any longer. Rather he said, \\"If the Romans want peace, let them surrender their weapons and pay gz√Æt√¢\\". Notes References *Seeing Islam As Others Saw It by Robert G.

It claims to be the oldest form of virtual life in existence, as it has been distributed since the late 1980s. Recent releases of the program can update their intelligence by connecting online and downloading newer personalities and histories. Screen shot from a beta release of Virtual Woman Millennium. This image was widely distributed to promote the software's upcoming release. Program play When Virtual Woman starts, the user is presented with a list of options and then may choose their Virtual Woman's ethnic type, personality, location, clothing, etc. or load a pre-built Virtual Woman from a Digital DNA file. Once the options are determined, the user is presented with a 3-D animated Virtual Woman of their selection and then can engage them in conversation, progressing in a manner similar to that of its predecessor, ELIZA and its successors, the chatbots. In most versions of Virtual Woman, this is done through the keyboard, but some versions also support voice input. In popular culture Virtual Woman's current publishing company, CyberPunk Software, claims that over one and a half million copies of Virtual Woman are in existence. Software sales and usage statistics from private companies are difficult to verify. WinSite, an independent Internet shareware distribution site that does publish public download counts, has for some time now listed some version of Virtual Woman in their top three shareware downloads of all time with well over seven hundred thousand downloads. The Washington Post reported on April 6, 2007 that two bank security guards who had been distracted from their duties by playing Virtual Woman and then tried to cover up the fact that they allowed US$52,000 to be stolen.

Criticisms As Virtual Woman has developed the ability to conduct longer and more realistic interactions, particularly in recent beta releases, criticism has arisenIs Talking to a Virtual Woman Cheating? by Jane Trebay that this may lead some users to social isolation, or to use the program as a substitute for real human interaction. However, these are criticisms that have been leveled at all video games and at the use of the Internet itself.Is Talking to a Virtual Woman Cheating? by Jane Trebay A company representative, Nancy, indirectly responded to such accusations in an interview with ABC News reporter Mike Martinez in 1998 by stating that Virtual Woman played a valuable role by allowing some form of social interactions for people who may not normally be able to take part in them. She cited a user who wrote to thank them because the program had relieved his boredom and isolation while he was recovering from a crippling accident in the hospital.

It is typically used when a street is very wide, as the pedestrian crossing can be too long for some individuals to cross in one traffic light cycle. They may also be seen on roads with higher speed limits. In the United Kingdom, refuge islands are commonly illuminated by a white 300 mm beacon mounted on a 5 m grey pole with white reflective bands.

Solar Power Refuge Beacon Patent No: GB2519445 - owner Ticknall Solar Ltd Solar powered refuge beacon Refuge islands may also be used when no light exists and pedestrians need safe harbour after managing one direction of traffic and before taking on the next. This significantly improves amenity for pedestrians trying to cross busy streets, as they are much more likely to find two small gaps in traffic rather than one situation in which gaps for both directions coincide. Since this reduces pedestrians' average waiting time, it also improves safety, with impatient pedestrians less likely to use gaps that turn out to be too short for safe crossing.Pedestrian planning and design guide - Land Transport New Zealand, 2007, Page 6-16 See also A Refuge island with traffic lights *Traffic island *Traffic sign *Traffic light *Road surface marking *Road marking machine *Sneckdown  References  Traffic calming Road infrastructure Pedestrian crossing components ","title":"Refuge island"},{"id":"6383276","title":"Digital terrestrial television in the Republic of Ireland"},{"id":"6383301","text":"Cedric Warren Dempsey (born April 14, 1932) is a sports administrator who became the third executive director of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) from 1994 to 2003.

Early Life Yeruchom Levovitz was born in 1873 (5633 in the Jewish calendar) in Lyuban, Minsk Voblast, Belarus (near Slutsk) to Avraham and Chasya Levovitz. He received his education in the yeshivas of Slobodka and Kelm.Rabbis who came from Lyuban He was a disciple of Nosson Tzvi Finkel, and Simcha Zissel Ziv of Kelm. Mir Yeshiva Levovitz was the spiritual leader of the Mir Yeshiva in Belarus until his death in 1936. His disciples were said to have followed his every word, never doing anything that they \\"felt\\" he would not want them to do. Most of the leaders of the yeshivas of inter-war Poland were Levovits's disciples. They would come on occasion to visit him and seek his advice. After World War II, much of orthodox Jewry in Europe was wiped out, along with their many yeshivas (Jewish schools of higher learning). One of the only yeshivas to survive as a whole body was the Mir Yeshiva, which managed to escape to Shanghai, China, and then on to America. Disciples Some of Levovitz's better known disciples include Shlomo Wolbe, Chaim Shmuelevitz, Aryeh Leib Malin, Dovid Povarsky, Abba Berman, Zelik Epstein and Shimon Schwab. His many discourses and lectures are preserved for posterity in the following sefarim: \\"Daas Torah,\\" \\"Daas Chochma U'Mussar,\\" \\"Shvivai Daas,\\" and \\"Sifsai Daas on Pirkei Avos\\" which are a staple of many yeshiva libraries today, as well as many Orthodox Jewish households. He died on the 18th of Sivan in the year 1936 at the age of sixty-three. He is buried in the town of Mir, Belarus. His grave site (recently rebuilt by his family) is a common destination for the many Jewish tourists who visit the decimated cities of pre-war eastern Europe. Rebuilding in America Most of Levovitz's family escaped the Nazis and made it to America where they were pioneers of the rebuilding of Orthodox Jewry in the United States. His son, Simcha Zissel Halevi Levovitz, was the founder of a yeshiva in Boro Park, Brooklyn, and was responsible for publishing the writings of his father, as well as publishing the writings of Simcha Zissel Ziv. His son in law Yisroel Chaim Kaplan, former rosh yeshiva in Brisk, Lithuania, came to America and served as rosh yeshiva in Beth Medrash Elyon in Monsey, NY. Reb Yeruchom Levovitz's grandson then went on to open the famous Beth Hatalmud yeshiva. Reb Leib Maalin served as the rosh yeshiva until his passing, when the leadership of the yeshiva was passed to Chaim Visokier. After Visokier's passing, Reb Naftali Kaplan became the rosh yeshiva along with Rabbis Sholom Menashe Gotlieb, Binyomin Zeilberger and Yisroel Perkowsky.

In other words, the brain registers the movements that muscles combine to make, not the individual muscles that are making the movements. Hence, this is why one can sign their name (albeit poorly) with their foot. Beevor's Axiom was coined by Dr. Charles Edward Beevor, an English neurologist. Dr. Beevor presented Beevor's Axiom in a series of four lectures from June 3, 1903 to July 4, 1903 before the Royal College of Physicians of London as part of the Croonian Lectures. His experiments showed that when an area of the cortex was stimulated, the body responded with a movement, not just a single muscle. Dr. Beevor concluded that ‚Äúonly co-ordinated movements are represented in the excitable cortex‚Äù In relation to Beevor's Axiom, it has been found that the brain encodes sequences, such as playing the piano, signing our name, wiping off a counter, and chopping vegetables, and once encoded and practiced, it takes less brain activity to perform them. This supports Beevor's Axiom, because the brain can recall movements easier than it can learn them. Beevor's Axiom is only partially true, however. Most behavior of muscles is encoded in the primary motor cortex (M1) and separated by muscle group. In an effort to understand the encoding in the M1, researchers observed commands of monkeys. Muscle cells changed firing rate according to the direction of the arm movements. Each neuron has one direction that elicits the greatest response. Some M1 neurons encode muscle contractions, while others react to particular movements, regardless of the muscles used to perform them. The key characteristic of the primary motor cortex is its dynamic nature; the M1 changes based on experience. The supplementary motor area (SMA) plays a key role in initiating motion sequences. The premotor cortex (PMA) plays a key role when motor sequences are guided by external events. They map behaviors as opposed to the M1 which maps specific movements. This could cause in issue in brain‚Äìcomputer interface research. If a researcher tries to excite only a muscle, it might be impossible without expecting a full movement.

The asylum closed in 1989 leaving Barnsley Hall Hospital in Bromsgrove as the remaining psychiatric hospital in the county. Most of the complex has been demolished to make way for a housing estate. History Origins Founded in 1847 as the Worcester County Pauper and Lunatic Asylum, it was designed by architects J. R. Hamilton and J. M. Medland of Gloucester and opened in August 1852. Situated between Worcester and Malvern on former farmland known as White Chimneys, the asylum was originally erected for the accommodation of 200 inmates but was later extended and by 1858 had 365 patients. Edward Elgar The doctors at the Asylum in the 1870s showed a remarkably enlightened attitude when they instituted a series of orchestral concerts there, as well as the Friday night dances for the inmates. Elgar, as a young violinist in the district played in the concerts from 1877, and in January 1879 succeeded Fred S. May in the post of Band Instructor. In 1879, at the age of 22, Elgar composed a number of works, the Powick Asylum Music, for the attendants' band. His job consisted of conducting the Asylum Band, made up of the staff of the Asylum, and composing music for the Friday dances. The authorities paid him ¬£4 per annum less than his predecessor, no doubt because of his inexperience, but he received about ¬£30 per year, plus 5 shillings for every polka and quadrille and one shilling and sixpence for accompaniments to the Christy's Minstrels ditties of the day. Research By the 1950s it had around 1,000 patients and major research and experimentation in the treatment of chronic depression and schizophrenia was being carried out. In 1952, after visiting Sandoz in Switzerland and meeting Dr. Albert Hofmann, Dr. Ronald Sandison moved to Powick and began pioneering British work in the psychiatric use of LSD, developing a program he called \\"Psycholytic Therapy\\" (literally \\"mind loosening therapy\\") for treatment of illnesses such as severe depression and schizophrenia. An LSD treatment unit was established at the hospital in 1958 in which Dr. Sandison administered his therapy until he left the institution in 1964. Medical Superintendent Dr. Arthur Spencer continued the program until Sandoz abruptly withdrew supplies of the drug in 1966, due to the problems of illicit recreational use. Records indicate that 683 patients had been treated with LSD in 13,785 separate sessions before the program was discontinued. In 2002 the NHS agreed to pay ¬£195,000, in an out of court settlement, to 43 former psychiatric patients who were treated with LSD between 1950 and 1970. Sandison writes about his early years at Powick: > ...the amenities were bleak in the extreme compared with Warlingham. The > hospital had been built in 1852 for 200 patients... Arthur (Spencer) and I > were the only consultants, and two assistant doctors completed the staff. > There were nearly 1,000 patients, 400 of whom were living in the four large > wards of the 'annexe' built in the 1890s. I discovered that the heating > system was defunct, many of the internal telephones did not work, and the > hospital was deeply impoverished in every department. This state of affairs > had been allowed to develop by the previous medical superintendent, Dr > Fenton... who had spent 43 years at Powick. He practised the utmost economy > and Powick became the cheapest hospital in the country... After discussion > and consultation with my colleagues at Powick, and with the professor of > Psychiatry in Birmingham, I undertook the clinical use of LSD at Powick > Hospital towards the end of 1952. Decline and closure In 1968 Powick Hospital featured in a controversial edition of the leading British investigative television programme World in Action, showing elderly patients in Ward F13 being left soaking in their own urine. The programme also featured other notorious examples of how the institution 'cared' for its patients in overcrowded conditions without dignity or privacy. This footage was subsequently re-used in a current affairs strand in 1993 - 1994. The footage of Ward F13's patients was superimposed on a picture of an asylum wall while a reporter disguised as a homeless schizophrenic looks back at how psychiatric patients were treated. The asylum wall at Powick itself was knocked down in the 1950s as part of Dr. Arthur Spencer's initiatives in updating and modernising the hospital. In the World in Action programme, Dr Spencer speaks of having to take the decision, as Medical Superintendent, to spend the limited funds available on acute rather than chronic care. The shocking revelations of the Ward F13 programme contributed to Powick being amongst the first wave of mental hospitals selected for closure in favour of community care developments. Acute admissions ceased in 1978 and the last patients were discharged in 1989. The hospital closed in 1989 and was bulldozed and redeveloped for housing. The main building was converted into flats and the Superintendent's Residence was converted to company offices.

He was a Democrat. Early life and education Roberts was born in rural Collin County, Texas in 1913. He grew up in the ranching town of Westminster, Texas, just outside McKinney. Roberts graduated from McKinney High School. He attended Texas A&M; University and North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas) before earning a bachelor's degree in agribusiness. Roberts earned his master's degree from the University of Texas. He served in the United States Navy from 1942 to 1945. He was the final individual off the US Hornet when it sank at the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October 1942. Later, he saw active duty in the Korean War while as a member of the U.S. Naval Reserve. Early career Roberts was on the staff of Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn of Texas, working in Washington, D.C., between 1941 and 1942 before going on active duty in World War II. After the war, he worked as a farmer and entered into agribusiness. He was a member of the Texas State Senate from 1955 to 1961, serving as the president pro tempore of the body in 1961. U.S. House of Representatives Roberts was elected as a Democrat to the Eighty-seventh Congress, by special election, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Sam Rayburn. He was re-elected to the nine succeeding Congresses, serving from January 30, 1962 to January 3, 1981. On November 22, 1963, Roberts was in the Dallas motorcade when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He was riding in the same car as the Dallas Mayor Earl Cabell, and the mayor's wife. Their car was four cars behind the limousine carrying JFK. The family of Ray Roberts can confirm that the Warren Commission or any other of its investigation personnel never asked Roberts a single question about the shooting. When Mrs. Cabell testified to the Warren Commission, she stated that shortly after the shots ended Roberts first said, \\"That is a .30-06.\\" (with Roberts meaning the shot(s) he could hear sounded like they were fired from a .30-06 type of rifle) and that Roberts had told her that he had also smelled the distinct odor of gun smoke (as did Mrs. Cabell and several other motorcade participants and witnesses who were all located down at street level, which was up-wind from the Texas School Book Depository, and 61' to 82' below and varying distances away from its sixth floor)Elizabeth Cabell testimony to the Warren Commission, volume 7, starting at page 485 ‚Äî The Testimony of Mrs. Earle Cabell.

The station is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. and airs a Mainstream Top 40 (CHR) radio format. Its studios are located just outside downtown Dayton and its transmitter is off Sandridge Drive near Interstate 75 in Moraine, Ohio WCHD broadcasts in the HD format.http://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=58 Its HD-2 channel is the primary station for the iHeart Smooth Jazz format. History WCHD's HD Radio Channels on a SPARC Radio with PSD. The station began its history on December 16, 1993 on 94.5 MHz as alternative rock WZJX (94-5 X-Rock), Dayton's first-ever alternative station. George Wymer was General Manager; Randy Scovil was Program Director as well as the afternoon drive host. Steve Stone and Christy Chatman hosted the morning show, Andy Sims did mid-days, and Greg Johns hosted the evening shift. During the six months as an alternative station, X-Rock brought two sell-out shows to the Hara Arena: The Breeders and the Afghan Whigs, and later The Smashing Pumpkins. In the station's first ratings period (Jan‚ÄìMarch 1994), X-Rock's ratings in the 18‚Äì34 demographic had already grown to half of longtime Dayton rock station WTUE. In early May 1994, the station was sold to Terry Jacobs (formerly of Jacor) who decided to change the format to be Dayton's third oldies station, to compete with similar formats at 95.3 FM and 103.9 FM. On 3 May, the X-Rock staff was fired. The station began playing 20 different versions of \\"Louie Louie\\" and calling itself \\"Louie 95\\" in an effort to entice listeners by playing different versions of the mid-1960s hit \\"Louie, Louie\\", a Richard Berry-penned song popularized by The Kingsmen, and Paul Revere and The Raiders among many others. During that time it was known as \\"The Chicken\\" in reference to its mascot, a giant whole broiled chicken dressed in seasonal clothing. It became WDOL, an oldies outlet, until August 9, 1996, when consistently minuscule ratings led to a switch to Rhythmic contemporary as WBTT, \\"94.5 The Beat\\". By 1999, it shifted to Mainstream Top 40 and began a serious challenge to take on the area's longtime rival, WGTZ. It would later drop \\"The Beat\\" branding to become WDKF, \\"94.5 KISS-FM\\", in 2000, after Clear Channel expanded the brand to new markets. Despite the move, the station maintained a Rhythmic lean during that tenure. In March 2005, WDKF held a \\"funeral\\" for \\"KISS-FM\\", and briefly stunted as \\"94.5 FM-Playing Whatever We Want, Whenever We Want\\". On March 30, 2005, at 3 PM, the all-new Channel 9-4-5 launched. Despite the changes however, the station continues to lean Rhythmic as it battle Main Line Broadcasting's Rhythmic Contemporary rival WDHT for listeners. Main Line's other station, WGTZ, dropped its Top 40 format in November 2007 and flipped to \\"Fly 92.9\\", a \\"We Play Everything\\"-type Adult hits format, making WDKF the only CHR station in Dayton. The \\"Channel\\" branding was used previously in the late 1960s by sister station WONE (AM) \\"Channel 98\\" for its then-Top 40 format when it competed with WGTZ's AM sister WING. In May 2009, Clear Channel Communications removed all local disc jockeys from this station, and its website. The station picked up Clear Channel's new programming initiative known as Premium Choice 24 hours a day. The playlist was generated and used nationally in addition to voice tracks and liners. WDKF previously broadcast \\"Dayton's New Joints\\" on its HD-2 subchannel before going silent. Currently, on their HD-2 channel, is the IHeartRadio Smooth Jazz format. On May 24, 2011, Clear Channel announced that WDKF would swap signals with sister station WLQT, thus giving the former more signal coverage in the Dayton area.Frequency swap in Dayton from Radioinsight.com (May 24, 2011) On May 27, 2011 at 12:00 pm EDT, Channel 9-4-5 became Channel 9-9-9, continuing scheduled programming with On Air with Ryan Seacrest (radio)'s American Top 5 at noon. On September 17, 2012, WDKF changed its call letters to WCHD to go with the \\"Channel 9-9-9\\" branding. Channel 9-9-9 has since hired a local afternoon disc jockey and its music is now being programmed by a local program director, Steven Lewis, from 6am - 10pm. This gives Channel 9-9-9 more of a local flavor compared to most Premium Choice [Clear Channel] stations. The station previously broadcast \\"Dayton's New Joints\\" on its HD-2 subchannel before going silent. Currently, the HD-2 channel carries the IHeartRadio Smooth Jazz format. WCHD was the original call sign of what is now WDMK 105.9 FM in Detroit, Michigan.

Early years Smith was born in Auckland and educated at Wellesley Street School. He became a successful jockey and won the 1894 New Zealand Cup, riding Impulse. He had to abandon his racing career after gaining weight. Athletics As a track athlete, Smith was an outstanding sprinter and hurdler, winning 15 national championships between 1898 and 1904 (100 yards sprint and 440 yards hurdles five times each and the 120 yards hurdles four times plus the 250 yards once), as well as multiple Australasian championships and the 1902 British AAA quarter-mile hurdles, in which event he had an unofficial world record of 58.5s. While in Britain in 1902 Manningham F.C. tried to sign Smith to play rugby league. Smith turned down the ¬£100 contract.Coffey and Wood The Kiwis: 100 Years of International Rugby League Rugby union Smith began his rugby career in 1895 playing rugby union for the City Rugby Club in Auckland. He first represented his home province Auckland in 1896 and, in the following year made, his d√©but for the New Zealand national team against New South Wales. However, in the following years, Smith played little rugby, instead preferring to concentrate on track. He made a comeback in 1901, gaining All Black selection, before disappearing again until he was enticed back to the game with the prospect of joining the 'Originals' tour to the British Isles and France in 1905. During the Originals tour, Smith was one of the outstanding players, especially in the early part of the tour, playing in 19 games, including the internationals against Scotland and Ireland, and scoring 19 tries. It was during this time in Britain that he first saw Northern Union being played. Altogether, Smith made 39 appearances for New Zealand in rugby union, 21 as a wing and 18 at centre, and scored 34 tries. Smith played for the City club and represented Auckland in 1906. City conducted a four-game tour of Sydney after the season had ended.Coffey, John and Bernie Wood Auckland, 100 years of rugby league, 1909‚Äì2009, 2009. , p.3. Rugby league While in Sydney with the City club Smith met an Australian entrepreneur, James Giltinan, and discussed the potential of professional rugby in Australasia. Smith is reported to have told Giltinan \\"What about you gettings Rugby League going in Australia, and I'll do my best when I cross the Tasman home.\\"John Haynes From All Blacks to All Golds: Rugby League's Pioneers, Christchurch, Ryan and Haynes, 1996. He then met Albert Baskiville in Wellington and played a leading part in the formation of the professional 1907-1908 New Zealand rugby tour of Great Britain, helping to select the touring party. At the time Smith was probably the best known athlete in New Zealand and his involvement in the tour lent it credibility and increased its ability to attract players. Smith was elected vice-captain and the tour was a success, both financially and on the field, with the team winning its three match series against Great Britain. Smith later described the tour as the happiest one he had ever been associated with. After touring with the professional All Blacks he stayed on in Britain to play professionally with the Oldham club, signing a ¬£150 contract. This gave Smith the financial freedom he had been seeking and he bought his fianc√©e over from New Zealand to join him in Oldham. George William Smith played right-, i.e. number 3, in Oldham's 9-10 defeat by Wigan in the 1908 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1908‚Äì09 season at Wheater's Field, Broughton, Salford on Saturday 19 December 1908. Smith played , i.e. number 5, in Oldham's 3-7 defeat by Wigan in the Championship Final during the 1908‚Äì09 season at The Willows, Salford on Saturday 1 May 1909. By 1912 Smith had moved into the forwards and played at second row. Smith played for the club until 1916 when a broken leg ended his career. After retirement Smith then joined a textile firm but in 1932 returned to rugby league, being involved in the Oldham coaching staff for three years. He often met touring New Zealand League and All Blacks sides. He lived in Oldham until his death on 7 December 1954. Legacy Smith was posthumously inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame in 1995. For his role in the birth of international rugby league, the 'George Smith Medal' was minted in 2002 to be awarded to the player of Test series between Great Britain and New Zealand. That year Smith's 92-year-old daughter Edna Stansfield, who was living in Oldham, viewed the medal inspired by her father when she was visited by a director of the New Zealand Rugby League. His son, George Smith, played both rugby codes and died in a Japanese prisoner camp in 1943. References *McMillan, N. A. C. 'Smith, George William 1874 ‚Äì 1954'.

History Shortly after the Soviet Union was formed in 1922 a position of First Secretary of the Communist Party was created in each Soviet Republic. The Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created in 1924 as a subunit of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic and the first Acting Secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan was appointed that year. In 1929 Tajikistan received full republic status separate from Uzbekistan and in 1930 the position of First Secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan was created. The position changed hands numerous times during the 1920s and 1930s due to Stalin's fear of keeping leaders in power for long periods of time. A number of the former leaders of the Communist Party of Tajikistan perished in the Great Purge of the 1930s. The leaders of Tajikistan were usually ethnic Tajiks with the exceptions of Mirzo Dovud Guseinov, Dmitri Protopopov and Grigory Broydo: the first one was an ethnic Azerbaijani while the last two were ethnic Russians who were appointed during the height of Stalin‚Äôs paranoia. While the symbolic value of a Tajik First Secretary was apparent, the leadership of Tajikistan was wholly subservient to Moscow and the second in power of the Communist Party of Tajikistan was always an ethnic Russian. After World War II every appointed First Secretary was a Tajik from the region of Leninabad, now named Sughd. This was a reflection of the fact that the leadership of Uzbekistan highly influenced the appointment of leaders in Tajikistan and chose leaders from Leninabad because of its historic ties to Uzbekistan's urban centers in the Fergana Valley. There have even been accusations that some of the Leninabadi leaders of Tajikistan were actually Uzbek because their dialect of Tajik had a number of loan words from Uzbek. The Leninabai monopoly on power was a key factor in igniting the civil unrest that followed Tajikistan's independence in 1991 and led to the Tajikistan Civil War. The longest serving First Secretary was Jabor Rasulov, who came to power in 1961 and died in office in 1982. Rasulov‚Äôs successor was Rahmon Nabiyev, who was ousted in a corruption scandal in 1985. The position First Secretary was downgraded in November 1991 when then First Secretary Qahhor Mahkamov was appointed to the newly created executive position of President of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic. Mahkamov was the last First Secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan to also serve as head of state of Tajikistan when he resigned his office on August 31, 1991 following his support of the August Coup in Moscow. One of the most celebrated First Secretaries was Bobojon Ghafurov, a renowned scholar who wrote numerous works on the history of Tajikistan.

It is also celebrated by Scout and Guide organizations These are the organizations which belong at the same time to the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts and to the World Organization of the Scout Movement. They include for egample the organizations of many European countries and some boy-oriented associations Organizations belonging to World Organization of the Scout Movement only, but allowing girls around the world. It is a day when they think about their \\"sisters\\" (and \\"brothers\\") in all the countries of the world, the meaning of Guiding, and its global impact. Most recently, World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts has selected an important international issue as the theme for each year's World Thinking Day, and selected a focus country from each of their five world regions. Girl Guides and Girl Scouts use these as an opportunity to study and appreciate other countries and cultures, and equally increase awareness and sensitivity on global concerns. Donations are collected for the Thinking Day Fund which supports projects to help Girl Guides and Scouts around the world. 22 February was chosen as it was the birthday of Scouting and Guiding founder Lord Robert Baden-Powell and of Lady Olave Baden-Powell, his wife and World Chief Guide. Other Scouts celebrate it as B.-P. Day or Founders' Day. At the local level, the event is sometimes held to the closer weekend or another convenient date. History In 1926, at the Fourth Girl Scout International Conference, held at Girl Scouts of the United States‚Äôs Camp Edith Macy (presently the Edith Macy Conference Center), the conference delegates highlighted the need for a special international day, when Girl Guides and Girl Scouts would think about the worldwide spread of Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting, and of all the Girl Guides and Girl Scouts around the world, giving them, their \\"sisters,\\" thanks and appreciation. It was decided by the delegates that this day would be 22 February, birthday of both Lord Baden- Powell, founder of the Boy Scout movement, and Lady Olave Baden-Powell, his wife and the First World Chief Guide. In 1999, at the 30th World Conference, held in Ireland, the name was changed from \\"Thinking Day\\" to \\"World Thinking Day\\", in order to emphasize the global aspect of this special day. World Thinking Day Fund At the Seventh World Conference in Poland, a Belgian delegate suggested that the girls' appreciation and friendship should not only be shown by the exchange of wishes, but also through presents, which are after all typical of birthdays, in the form of a voluntary contribution to the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. In her first letter about the World Thinking Day Fund Lady Baden-Powell, the World Chief Guide, asked the Girl Guides and Girl Scouts to donate \\"a penny for your thoughts,\\" in order to support the Movement. The amount raised was ¬£520 12s 6d in 1933, and rose to ¬£35,346 in 1971. The World Thinking Day Fund is used to help more girls and young women around the world by spreading the Girl Guiding/Girl Scouting programme. World Thinking Day themes The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts chooses a theme for each World Thinking Day and proposes related activities. Themes include: * 2005: \\"Think about food\\" * 2006: \\"Think about, talk about and do something about adolescent health issues\\"; often shortened to Think about adolescent health * 2007: \\"Discover your potential by taking the lead, growing friendships, and speaking out\\"; often shortened to Discover your potential * 2008: \\"Think about water\\" * 2009: UN Millennium Development Goal 6: \\"Stop the spread of AIDS, malaria and other diseases\\"; often shortened to Stop the spread of diseases * 2010: UN Millennium Development Goal 1: Girls worldwide say \\"Together we can end extreme poverty and hunger\\". * 2011: UN Millennium Development Goal 3: Girls worldwide say \\"Empowering girls will change our world\\". * 2012: \\"Environment\\": UN Millennium Development Goal 7: Girls worldwide say ‚ÄúWe can save our planet‚Äù. * 2013: UN Millennium Development Goal 4: \\"Reduce child mortality\\" and UN Millennium Development Goal 5:\\"Improve maternal health\\" * 2014: UN Millennium Development Goal 2: \\"Providing universal access to primary education\\" * 2015: UN Millennium Development Goal 8: \\"Developing partnerships for global development\\" * 2016: \\"Connect\\" * 2017: \\"Grow\\" * 2018: \\"Impact\\" * 2019: \\"Leadership\\" * 2020: \\"Living Threads\\" Traditions and activities Every year on 22 February, Rangers from Mona Burgin's Unit in Auckland, New Zealand set off before dawn, while it is still dark, and they climb to the top of Maungawhau / Mount Eden. There they set up their little campfire and a flag- staff, and as the sun rises over the sea they raise the Guide World Flag, they sing the World Song, and they speak of some of the people and the countries they are Thinking about - and so they start \\"The Big Think\\" which then travels all the way round the world. On the nearest weekend to World Thinking Day, Girl Guides and Girl Scouts from across the world come together on ScoutLink to chat with each other and celebrate their Founders. Others are involved with Thinking Day on the Air (TDOTA) using amateur radio, similar to the Jamboree On The Air of the Scout movement. Some World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts member organizations use it as an opportunity to do projects with their 'twin' organization, such as Canada and Dominica . One tradition is that every Scout or Guide, ex-Scout or ex-Guide, places a candle in their window that night at dusk:- \\"This is my little Guiding Light, I'm going to let it shine.\\" It is also a tradition to send letters or postcards to other Scout and Guides before Thinking Day. In 2009, 2010,2011, 2012 and 2013 a postcard campaign was organized by the Ring deutscher Pfadfinderverb√§nde, Ring Deutscher Pfadfinderinnenverb√§nde, L√´tzebuerger Guiden a Scouten, Swiss Guide and Scout Movement, Pfadfinder und Pfadfinderinnen Liechtensteins and Pfadfinder und Pfadfinderinnen √ñsterreichs.

The underlying assumption of paternity fraud is that the mother deliberately misidentified the biological father. Paternity fraud is related to the historical understanding of adultery. Occurrence Research published in 2016 indicated that one in 50 British fathers is unknowingly raising a child who is the biological child of another man, and that misattributed paternity is rarer than commonly believed.One in 50 British fathers unknowingly raises another man's child Published by The Telegraph, April 6, 2016 A 2005 scientific review of international published studies of paternal discrepancy found a range in incidence, around the world, from 0.8% to 30% (median 3.7%). However, as many of the studies were conducted between the 1950s and the 1980s, numbers may be unreliable due to the inaccuracies of genetic testing methods and procedures used at the time. Studies ranging in date from 1991 to 1999 quote the following incidence rates: 11.8% (Mexico), 4.0% (Canada), 2.8% (France), 1.4% and 1.6% (UK), and 0.8% (Switzerland). These numbers suggest that the widely quoted and unsubstantiated figure of 10% of non-paternal events is an overestimate. However, in studies that solely looked at couples who obtained paternity testing because paternity was being disputed, there are higher levels: an incidence of 17% to 33% (median of 26.9%). Most at risk were those born to younger parents, to unmarried couples and those of lower socio-economic status, or from certain cultural groups. A 2008 study in the United Kingdom found that biological fathers were misidentified in 0.2% (1 in 500) of the cases processed by the Child Support Agency. Of that 0.2%, those resolved with DNA paternity testing between 2004 and 2008 showed that between 10 and 19% of mothers had misidentified the biological father; data about why mothers identified the wrong biological father was not available. Criticism The topic of paternity fraud is controversial. In the Journal of Medical Ethics, Heather Draper writes that: \\"claims for reimbursement and compensation in cases of misattributed paternity produce the same distorted and thin view of what it means to be a father that paternity testing assumes, and underscores a trend that is not in the interests of children.\\" Lyn Turner says that the concept of paternity fraud is about the \\"demonization of mothers\\". Law by country Australia The Victorian County Court in 2002 awarded Mr. Magill $70,000 compensation for damages and economic loss against his ex-wife as a result of DNA testing in 2000 that showed only one of three children he was paying support for were genetically his. That ruling was later overturned in 2005 by the Victorian Court of Appeal finding that \\"intent to deceive\\" by the ex-wife had not been proven regarding misrepresentations made by Ms. Magill in birth forms about the children's paternity. This ruling was in turn then appealed with the High Court of Australia. In 2006 Australia's High Court struck down the appeal, upholding the 2005 Victorian Court of Appeal ruling. Chief Justice Murray Gleeson in the 94 page High Court Ruling opined, \\"Without doubt the appellant's wife deceived him but the hurtful deception was in her infidelity, not in her failure to admit it.\\" Mr. Magill as part of the ruling was also ordered to pay the Child Support Agency's legal fees during the previous 18 months of litigation. The 2006 High Court Ruling led to many calls from within Australia for reforms and changes to the Family Law Act and the Child Support Act to help protect men in Mr Magill's situation. By 2008 putative fathers in Australia could begin using DNA testing to confirm paternity regarding support orders after new changes, \\"section 143 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act\\", took effect regarding Family Court policies. The Magill case is often cited regarding new law reforms in Australia and is considered a landmark type case. Canada Mr. Cornelio began paying child support for his ex-wife's twins after the couple separated in 1998. The former couple settled upon a joint custody agreement in 2002 that continued Mr. Cornelio's monetary child support for the twins. Shortly afterwards Ms. Cornelio requested a reduction in visitation time along with an increase in support payments. Mr. Cornelio became suspicious of the paternity of the twins. A subsequent DNA test revealed that he was not their biological father. A request was made by Mr. Cornelio to be excused from paying further child support, claiming to be the victim of misrepresentation or fraud when Ms. Cornelio failed to disclose the extramarital affair when he signed the 2002 joint custody agreement. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice in 2008 ruled against the request to be excused or reimbursed for child support payments. Judge van Rensburg, in deciding to deny the request, noted that Mr. Cornelio had wondered at the time of his separation if an affair by his ex-wife had actually been responsible for the twins. \\"It was not until access was interrupted and Ms. Cornelio commenced proceedings seeking increased child support that the respondent began pursuing this issue,\\" the judge remarked. \\"The fact of that relationship ‚Äì even if it has now become strained ‚Äì is sufficient to require Mr. Cornelio to continue to contribute toward the children's material needs.\\" Finland The default in Finnish law as of 2018 is that the husband is the acknowledged father of the child who is born into wedlock (or to a deceased husband). Only if the wife agrees, can that initial determination be set to something else. However, from 2016 the general right the mother to solely allow or prevent the parental investigation was abolished. The default and immediately forcing juridical assumption of paternity of a husband was not changed in the latest 2015 act. A man can bring up a later legal action to annul his paternity, disregarding of the resistance of his wife. The legal action for annulment may be brought in the district court by a man whose paternity has been determined on the basis of either marriage or by some other authoritative decision. However, the ruling of the court can be pretty much anything and the UN declaration of children's rights are not followed.Isyyslaki mullistuu: Tunnukseen helpotus, sylkin√§ytekoe ja peruutusmahdollisuusFinland Paternity Act 2015, section 41 A man who has officially acknowledged paternity relinquishes his rights to further actions if he, knowing the woman had a sexual intercourse with another man, or that she has used foreign sperm for fertilization, has stated in writing following birth of the child that the child is biologically his.Finland Paternity Act 2015, section 42 Otherwise legally binding prebirth acknowledgment of a man must be rejected, if either the health care staff of the child supervisor do have a founded suspicion that the man is not a father of the child, or he is for any reason not capable to understand what he is doing when acknowledging the paternity.Finland Paternity Act 2015, section 16 If a mother deliberately gives false information to the authorities, which contributes to the erroneous establishment of paternity, she may be fined.Finland Paternity Act 2015, section 57 South Korea In 2004, a South Korean man was awarded $42,380 compensation for pain and suffering when a DNA test established that his ex-wife's paternity claim regarding their child was misattributed. When Mr. Doe, who had married Ms. Doe based on her paternity claim, began a lawsuit against a hospital for switching his child at birth, Ms. Doe claimed to having been pregnant with another man's baby. Switzerland On 5 January 2015, the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland (decision 5A_619 of 2015) decided on a case wherein a plaintiff challenged the paternity of his (alleged) daughter. The plaintiff had his sperm examined in November 2009. As a result of the examination, the plaintiff‚Äôs fertility was found to be 3%. The court contended that the alleged father should have started investigating his paternity as a consequence of that finding. The plaintiff actually had his non-paternity confirmed via DNA evidence in 2013 upon failure of his marriage. The court held that the one year time limit under Swiss civil code article 260c for filing an action lapsed due to the plaintiff‚Äôs (the alleged father‚Äôs) inactivity for more than two years. The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland thus confirmed the ruling by the first instance and dismissed the appeal. It follows that the plaintiff‚Äôs financial obligations as to his (alleged) daughter will not change. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, paternity fraud, like adultery, is not a criminal offenceShould we be doing more to expose paternity fraud? Published in The Telegraph, 4 September 2015 except in the case of the lineage of the children of the British monarch under the Treason Act 1351 where the adulterers are punishable as adultering against the lineage of the King with the King's \\"companion, ... or the wife of the King's eldest son and heir\\". Knowingly making a false statement on a public document is a criminal offence, including naming someone who is not the biological father. As of 2008, no individual has been prosecuted in a case involving paternity fraud.DNA testing: One in 500 fathers wrongly identified by mothers in Child Support Agency claims Published in The Guardian, 1st August 2008 A mother is permitted to not state the name of the biological father if she does not know it. Paternity fraud is a form of misattributed paternity. The split in 2002 between a couple, identified for legal reasons as Mr. A and Ms. B, prompted Mr. A to pursue a parental contract to establish his non-married rights as their child's father. Ms. B then requested a DNA test that later showed Mr. A was not the (then) five year old's father. Following the discovery Mr. A then sued Ms. B for damages of up to ¬£100,000 as a result of the deceit. During 2007 in what was reported as the first known case of its kind to reach trial in Britain, the High Court ruled in favor of awarding ¬£7,500 distress damages with another ¬£14,943 for holidays and meals out Mr. A spent on Ms. B (not the child). The judgment fell short of listed suit amount because the London court did not allow damages for the child's material costs incurred because of Mr. A's enjoyment of the relationship. The judge, Sir John Blofeld, said he was satisfied that Mr. A's motivation in coming to court was not as a lever for contact with the child but because he did not want \\"to be taken for a ride\\". United States The United States has historically imposed a strong presumption of marital paternity and has also imposed barriers to paternity challenges once paternity has been legally established. Since the advent of DNA testing, laws and guidelines have been proposed or enacted that may allow for a paternity challenge by a legal father who later determines he is not a child's biological father, or by a biological father who learns that somebody else has been named on a child's birth certificate as the child's father. =Georgia= Paternity fraud activist Carnell Smith has raised awareness about how many men ‚Äî and, often, boys ‚Äî are tricked into paying child support for kids that aren't even theirs.He has successfully lobbied the Georgia state legislature to expand the time frame in which paternity tests could be administered. Mandatory paternity testing is available in Georgia and is necessary in order to obtain a child support order in the state, the law differentiates between legitimacy and paternity and child support orders can only be ordered after a paternity test.https://www.jacksonville.com/news/georgia/2015-06-17/story/new-georgia- law-will-allow-dna-testing-paternity-child-support- cases?page=1https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/magazine/22Paternity-t.html?mtrref=undefined&gwh;=8D7BF682B1FC73F329C357E8A74BDE38&gwt;=pay =California= In the case of County of Los Angeles v. Navarro, in 1996, the County of Los Angeles entered a default judgment against putative father Mr. Navarro and ordered him to pay monthly support for Ms. Doe's two children. The complaint to establish paternity filed by the Bureau of Family Support Operations was based on information provided by Ms. Doe naming \\"Manuel Nava\\" as the children's father. The agency determined that Mr. Navarro was the father in question and delivered notice to his sister's residence listing Mr. Navarro as \\"co-resident\\", a notice Mr. Navarro denied ever receiving. In 2001 Mr. Navarro, armed with a DNA test showing he was not the children's father, sued the County of Los Angeles asking to be relieved from the support order. The County of Los Angeles opposed the motion, arguing the motion was filed after the six month limit to contest a default judgment and the mother‚Äôs mere assertion that he was the father was insufficient to establish extrinsic fraud. The trial court sided with the County and denied the motion. This ruling was then appealed before the California 2nd Appellate Court of Appeal. In 2004 the court of appeal reversed the trial court decision ruling in favor of Mr. Navarro and became the first published California case to hold that the statute of limitations did not apply in setting aside an old default judgment against a paternity fraud victim. Immediately after the ruling was issued, the Los Angeles County Child Support Services Department announced that it would request that the case be depublished so it could not be used as a precedent by other men in Mr. Navarro's situation. That request was later denied by the California Supreme Court. In 2004, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed in to law AB 252, which allows men who prove they are not the biological father more resources to fight paying child support; the law expired in 2007.https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=200320040AB252http://www.metroactive.com/bohemian/07.19.06/paternity-0629.html =Florida= In the case of Parker v. Parker, as part of their 2001 Florida divorce settlement Mr. Parker was obliged to pay $1200 monthly child support based on Ms. Parker's representations to the court that Mr. Parker was the child's biological father. In 2003 Ms. Parker filed a motion for contempt and a petition to enforce child support against Mr. Parker which prompted a DNA test showing that Mr. Parker was not the child's biological father. The motion was 16 months after their divorce, Florida law (at that time) only allowed the husband 12 months to contest paternity following divorce. Mr. Parker's court ordered payments would total about $216,000 over the next fifteen years. Mr. Parker filed a petition for relief claiming that the misrepresentation of paternity had resulted in a fraudulent support order. This was dismissed by both the Trial and then, in 2005, the Court of Appeal as being intrinsic fraud and subject to the Florida one year time limit to contest a dissolution decree, not extrinsic fraud, or a fraud upon the court, that can form the basis for relief from judgment more than a year later. This ruling was then appealed before the Florida Supreme Court who, in 2007, denied Mr. Parker's suit upholding the Fourth District Court of Appeal 2005 ruling. During 2006, the Florida statutes changed allowing a DNA test to be considered new evidence to contest a support order after the one year time limit. In its published opinion the Supreme Court Ruling in 2007 noted the change in Florida Statutes, \\"which provides the circumstances and procedures under which a male may disestablish paternity and terminate a child support obligation\\"; however, the court decided not to consider the applicability of this new statute to Mr. Parker's circumstances, kicking the question of a retrial under the new law back to the Trial Courts. Because the basic facts are little questioned and the case explores differences between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud, other state Supreme Courts, including Iowa and Tennessee, have cited Parker v. Parker when writing opinions of their own for paternity fraud type cases. =Iowa= In 2012 the Iowa Supreme Court in ruling to allow a paternity fraud tort to proceed as it \\"fits comfortably within the traditional boundaries of fraud law.\\", and that \\"It is supported by common law standards for fraud and is not contrary to public policy or the statutory policy of this state.\\" =New Mexico= In the case of Barreras v. Trevino, Mr. Barreras and Ms. Trevino divorced in 1999 with Ms. Trevino shortly afterwards gaining a support order for her supposed daughter with Mr. Barreras named as the putative father. In 2004 a New Mexico court ruled that the child Mr. Barreras had (up until then) paid $20,000 support to Ms. Trevino for did not actually exist. Mr. Barreras sued a DNA testing laboratory in 2006 for falsifying two separate DNA tests for the supposed child by using samples taken from his adult daughter who, along with one of the lab employees, also face fraud charges. Ms. Trevino pleaded guilty in 2008 to charges of fraud and perjury, and was sentenced to twenty-one years in prison. Trevino served 16 months in federal prison in Arizona for claiming the non-existent girl on tax returns. As part of the paternity fraud Ms. Trevino was able to obtain a birth certificate, medicare card and social security card for the fictitious girl prompting (then) Gov. Bill Richardson to direct New Mexico Department of Human Services to explain how several government agencies became not only unwitting partners in the fraud, but also resisted efforts to correct it. Letters and calls from Mr. Barreras to the New Mexico child support agency about his vasectomy in 1998 were ignored and when the child support enforcement division's order to bring the supposed child in for more paternity tests were not complied with by Ms. Trevino the agency simply closed the case without further investigation. =Tennessee= In the case of Hodge v. Craig in October 2012, intentional misrepresentation of paternity was recognized by a unanimous Tennessee Supreme Court in Hodge v. Craig, a case where the mother intentionally lied to a man about who the father of the child was. Based on the mother's assurances the couple married but later divorced. The plaintiff dutifully paid child support including medical insurance for the child. Based on physical differences between himself and the child he obtained a tissue sample and confirmed his suspicions. Damages were awarded in compensation for child support paid for 15 years. The court's decision was based on the common law remedy of intentional misrepresentation; the court distinguished the award of damages from a retroactive modification of child support. The action was for damages; it was not a suit to disestablish paternity.

The station is owned by Rogers Media and broadcasts at 92.9 MHz. CFLT's studios are located on Young Street in Halifax, while its transmitter is located on Washmill Lake Drive in Clayton Park. The station is the successor to Newcap-owned AM station CFDR (780 kHz), which signed off on July 27, 2009, eleven days before the FM station's official launch. History CFDR CFDR had made its home at various locations on the dial, first at 790 kHz, moving to 680 kHz in 1978, then to 780 kHz in 1991.Decision CRTC 89-866 Originally owned and operated by Patterson Broadcasters Ltd. (consisting of President C.A. (Arnie) Patterson, Senior Vice-President/National Sales Director W.L. (Bill) Patterson and Vice- President/Chief Engineer Jack Hutchison), CFDR (the \\"DR\\" standing for \\"Dartmouth Radio\\"), also known as \\"CF Big 'D' R\\", first hit the AM dial in 1962. The studios were originally located at 66 Ochterloney St. in Dartmouth, and moved to 12 Queen St. in 1971, until the decision was made in 1981 to occupy half of the 18th floor and the entire penthouse (19th floor) of the Queen Square building (which commanded an excellent view of Halifax Harbour). CFDR and CFRQ moved their broadcasting facilities to the CIEZ building in Bedford in 1995. CFDR's final logo as an AM station The station's 790 kHz transmitter was on the Montague Mines Road in the suburbs of Dartmouth before relocating to Kearney Lake Road in Bedford with the change to 680 kHz. When the frequency changed to 780 kHz, the transmitter was moved to St. Margaret's Bay Road in the HRM community of Lakeside. Popular disc jockeys during CFDR's flagship easy listening era included avuncular morning man Gerry Parsons (with his signature \\"March Around the Breakfast Table\\"), smooth-voiced Tony Beech (of Sunday night's \\"Candlelight and Wine\\" renown), Jack Hutchison's \\"Tartan Hour\\" on Saturday mornings, Program Director Gail Rice (mid-days), Clary Stubbert (afternoon drive), midnights with Dave Tramley and Paul Meagher, traffic reporter. Other popular former DJs and announcers include Colleen Jones, \\"Graveyard Shifter\\" Ron Roberts, Andrew Boyle, Cam Allen, Dale Schwartz, John Cunningham and John Kyte. CFDR was an easy listening station until 1987, when it changed its format to Top 40/CHR; around the same time, it also began broadcasting in Motorola C-QUAM AM stereo. The format change to hit music was protested vehemently by fans of the Easy Listening format in the Halifax area. It generated many complaints to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), and to the station itself, but the format change stood until it switched to the country format in December 1993. Ultimately, the station became known as Classic Country 780 KIXX, differentiating itself from Halifax's more popular contemporary country station CHFX-FM; in addition, CFDR became one of a handful of radio stations in Canada to air the format. Conversion to FM and sale After CHNS moved to an FM frequency in July 2006, only two Halifax stations, CFDR and CJCH, remained on the AM dial in a market with over a dozen FM stations. In October 2006, Newcap applied to the CRTC to move CFDR to the FM band at 88.9 MHz. It was to drop its country format in favour of alternative rock, since CHFX would continue to air a country format. The station was to be branded LIVE 88.9, patterned after Newcap's Ottawa station CILV-FM. The move was approved in 2007, on condition that Newcap sell its 50% interest in CKUL-FM. With Newcap also owning CFRQ, as well as 50% of CKUL, converting CFDR to FM would have put Newcap in violation of CRTC regulations on radio station ownership, which limits a single company to two AM and two FM stations per market. After CTVglobemedia announced plans to convert CJCH to FM as well, it was required to divest its own 50% share of CKUL to proceed with the conversion (as it also owned CIOO-FM). Newcap then elected in early 2008 to acquire full control of CKUL,Newcap press release, March 10, 2008 negating its own conversion plans in the process. However, this left CFDR as the last remaining AM station in the market, with Newcap unable to move the station to FM. Thus, later in the year, the company announced it would trade CFDR to Rogers Radio in exchange for Rogers' Sudbury station CIGM, with both stations applying to move to FM following the trade. CIGM's situation paralleled that of CFDR: it was the last AM station remaining in the Sudbury market, where Rogers already owned two FM stations, and hence it would not be permitted to convert to FM under Rogers ownership. Rogers later announced it would move CFDR to 92.9 MHz rather than the previously-approved 88.9. The applications were approved by the CRTC on November 24, 2008.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2008-326, November 24, 2008 780 CFDR went off the air permanently on July 27, 2009 at 10:00 a.m. ADT, coinciding with the final consummation of the Rogers-Newcap swap. The last two songs played were \\"Who's Gonna Fill Their Shoes\\" by George Jones and \\"Happy Trails\\" by Dale Evans and Roy Rogers. A farewell message was posted by morning hosts Frank Lowe and Stephanie Woodin on 780 Kixx's former (now defunct) website 780kixx.ca. CFDR was the last remaining AM station in the Halifax area prior to the shutdown. CFDR was also the most powerful AM station in the province during the day at 50,000 watts. .

It is a member of the gadfly petrels and part of the subgroup known as Cookilaria petrels, which includes the very similar Stejneger's petrel. Morphology Auckland Museum One of the smallest petrels, Cook's petrel is typically in length with a wingspan and a weight of around . Its colouration is typical of gadfly petrels: pale grey upperparts with a dark grey \\"M\\" on the wings and white underparts. The bill is long and black with tubular nostrils on both sides. As in all members of the order Procellariiformes, this nostril configuration enables an exceptionally acute sense of smell, which the birds use to locate food and nest sites in the dark.  Diet  Cook's petrel feeds mostly on fish and squid, with some crustaceans taken. The species is highly pelagic except when nesting. Habitat Cook's petrel photographed in Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand Cook's petrel breeds only in New Zealand on three small islands: Little Barrier Island, Great Barrier Island, and Codfish Island. The breeding season is the southern summer, October‚ÄìMay. It nests in burrows and rock crevices, preferring sites on thickly forested ridges. The species was formerly more numerous; the current population estimate is 1,258,000 and declining. It is classified as vulnerable because it breeds on only three small islands. While Little Barrier Island's population remains stable, the other two populations are decreasing. On Great Barrier Island, introduced pigs, dogs, rats and cats attack nests and burrows, as do native weka (a flightless rail), preying on eggs and nestlings and reducing the population from an estimated 20,000 to 100. Cook's petrel migrates to the Pacific Ocean from New Zealand when it is not breeding. It has sometimes been seen off the west coast of the United States and off the west coast of tropical South America.

Depictions of space travel within the Solar System is considered acceptable by proponents of mundane science fiction because it is plausible within current technologies. Mundane science fiction (MSF) is a niche literary movement that developed in the early 2000s (decade) which proposes \\"mundane science fiction\\" as its own subgenre of science fiction. MSF is typically characterized by its setting on Earth or within the Solar System; a lack of interstellar travel, intergalactic travel or human contact with extraterrestrials; and a believable use of technology and science as it exists at the time the story is written or a plausible extension of existing technology. The key tenets of the movement were set out in a 2004 manifesto written by Geoff Ryman and anonymous collaborators. There is debate over the boundaries of MSF and over which works can be considered canonical. Rudy Rucker has noted MSF's similarities to hard science fiction and Ritch Calvin has pointed out MSF's similarities to cyberpunk. Some commentators have identified science fiction films and television series which embody the MSF ethos of near-future realism. MSF has garnered a mixed reception from the science fiction community. While some science fiction authors have defended the proposed subgenre, others have argued that MSF is contrary to the longstanding imaginative tradition of science fiction, or questioned the need for a new subgenre.  Background   Precursor movements: 1950-1960s  Describing the context for the emergence of MSF, Christopher Cokinos cites Chris Nakashima-Brown in noting that a considerable body of science fiction entails fantasies about escape from scientific reality: \\"the escape from the subtly nihilistic dominion of reason in the post-Enlightenment West, into a generically unbound Jungian Disneyland...‚Äù. He argues that in the Golden Age of Science Fiction, stodgy tales of space opera using \\"bland prose\\" and \\"formulas of planetary romances, √ºber-robots, and cold equations\\" dominated. He also points out that SF writer Thomas Disch has similarly opined that the preference for weak, implausible depictions of science in sci fi is an ‚ÄúAmerican aspect of our ‚Äúlie-loving‚Äù culture‚Äù used by readers for escapism, though some Golden Age writers, such as Theodore Sturgeon, Philip Jos√© Farmer, and Ray Bradbury did transcend these formulas and developed nuanced characters and stories. Cokinos goes on to state that in the 1960s, various authors launched science fiction's New Wave, when \\"stylistic experimentation\\" in the writing and new topics meant less formulas and cliches. The authors had a profound \\"skepticism about science and technology\\", and there was an examination of ‚Äúinner space‚Äù (Ballard), \\"feminist...critiques, and ecology (Frank Herbert‚Äôs Dune). Similarly, BBC TV critic Hugh Montgomery notes that J.G. Ballard believed that the Golden Age‚Äôs focus on advanced interstellar spaceships was ‚Äúclich√©d and unilluminating‚Äù, preferring to write stories about humans‚Äô ‚Äúnext five minutes‚Äù and ‚Äúnear future‚Äù, which is ‚Äúimmediately recognisable to us, but invariably with a pretty unpleasant twist or three.‚Äù 2000s Ritch Calvin argues that the goals of MSF were predated by sociologist Wayne Brekhus in 2000, who published ‚ÄúA Mundane Manifesto‚Äù, calling for ‚Äúanalytically interesting studies of the socially uninteresting.‚Äù He argues for a focus on the ‚Äúmundane‚Äù because the ‚Äúextraordinary draws disproportionate theoretical attention from researchers‚Äù, which weakens the development of theory and creates a distorted image of reality. He stated that he hoped that the humanities would also focus on the mundane. Calvin noted that in 2001, the sci-fi website Futurismic came out against the traditional forms of SF, and instead called for an examination of the impact of scientific discoveries on human society. Futurismic is against all ‚Äúfantasy, horror, and space opera, as well as off-world SF, distant futures, aliens, alternate histories, and time travel‚Äù. Futurismic accepts fiction that is mundane, ‚Äúpost-cyberpunk sf, satirical/gonzo futurism, and realistic near future hard sf.‚Äù History and origins The MSF movement, inspired by an idea of computer programmer Julian Todd, was founded in 2004 during the Clarion workshop by novelist Geoff Ryman among others. The beliefs of the movement were later codified as the Mundane Manifesto. The authors of the Manifesto stated that they were ‚Äúpissed off and needing a tight girdle of discipline to restrain our sf imaginative silhouettes‚Äù. Ryman explained the MSF Manifesto in a speech to BOR√âAL‚Äôs 2007 Science Fiction convention in Montreal.\\"Take the Third Star on the Left and on til Morning\\" by Geoff Ryman, New York Review of Science Fiction, June 2007.http://mundane-sf.blogspot.com/2007/09/take-third-star-on- left-and-on-til.html Ryman claims that the MSF Manifesto was ‚Äújokey‚Äù and that it was not intended to be a ‚Äúserious‚Äù statement. The authors of the MSF Manifesto, apart from Ryman, are anonymous.  Style and ethos  MSF is a postulated science fiction subgenre:60 that exists between science fiction and the mainstream. According to the Manifesto, MSF writers believe it is unlikely that alien intelligence will overcome the physical constraints on interstellar travel any better than we can. As such, the Manifesto imagines a future on Earth and within the Solar System. The Manifesto states that alternative universes, parallel worlds, magic and the supernatural (including telepathy and telekinesis), time travel and teleportation are similarly avoided. MSF rarely involves interstellar travel or communication with alien civilization. In the MSF ethos, unfounded speculation about interstellar travel can lead to an illusion of a universe abundant with planets as hospitable to life as Earth, which encourages wasteful attitude to the abundance on Earth. MSF thus focuses on stories set on or near the Earth, with a believable use of technology and science as it exists at the time the story is written or which is a plausible extension of existing technology. MSF works explore topics such as enhanced genomes, environmental degradation, nanotechnology, quantum mechanics, robotics, and virtual reality. MSF claims to describe change ‚Äúalready in effect‚Äù and claims ‚Äúideological significance‚Äù. The boundaries between the proposed mundane subgenre and other genres, such as hard science fiction, dystopias, or cyberpunk are not defined. With MSF, the canonical works are vaguer than with cyberpunk. In its issue on mundane science fiction, British science fiction magazine Interzone attempted a checklist of topic that cannot be included for a work to be considered \\"mundane\\": Faster-than-light travel, psionic powers, nanobots, aliens, computer consciousness, profitable space travel, immortality, mind uploading, teleportation, or time travel. MSF proponents claims several notable science fiction authors have written in the style of the subgenre at least once. Media  Reception and controversy  In 2007 science fiction writer Rudy Rucker, author of the 1983 Transrealist Manifesto, blogged a response to the Mundane Manifesto. Rucker stated that he \\"prefer[s] to continue searching for ways to be less and less Mundane\\". He pointed out that alternate universes are \\"quite popular in modern physics\\" and stated that perhaps other worlds exist in other dimensions. He noted that fiction writers outside of SF use stories about time travel, so while implausible, it was worth exploring. While Rucker also rejected SF's ‚Äúescapist‚Äù tendencies, and called for transrealism, he argued that elements of SF which MSF advocates reject are ‚Äúsymbolic of archetypal modes of perception‚Äù that are needed in SF. In the March 2008 issue of Asimov's Science Fiction magazine, in writer Jim Kelly's ongoing \\"On the Net\\" column he agreed with many elements of MSF. At the same time, he wondered, ‚Äúhow was Mundane SF all that different from what had up until then been called hard science fiction?‚Äù.Asimov's Science Fiction, March 2008, ON THE NET: MUNDANE by James Patrick Kellyhttp://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?898301 Kelly states that too many of his favorite works fall outside the tenets of MSF. Both Kelly and Calvin mention the criticism by Ian McDonald, and his fundamental objection, that lots of good science fiction is being written without any awareness of or need for the manifesto. Niall Harrison argued that Interzone #216's collection of MSF stories does not develop ‚Äúa convincing case for mundane sf.‚Äù Also in 2008, Chris Cokinos described The Mundane Manifesto as anthropocentric. He noted that the concern in MSF about wasting the abundance of Earth is influenced by the \\"...moral climate that permeates North American and British nature writing\\", adding that MSF is intended \\"more as compass than chimera\\". In 2009, writer Kate McKinney Maddalena noted that the MSF blog was first used as a forum for debate about the new subgenre and that by 2009, bloggers were identifying MSF from the SF literature, and looking for newly published MSF (‚Äúmundane spotting‚Äù). Maddelena added that Ryman's naming of MSF \\"only marks (and encourages) a high point in SF‚Äôs social and ecological consciousness and conscience.‚Äù Also in 2009, SF writer Claire L. Evans called it a ‚Äúcontroversial recent sub-genre‚Äù; Not What If: What If Not, September 6, 2009 by Claire L. Evans, TaskNewsletter.jpg http://urbanhonking.com/spacecanon/2009/09/06/not_what_if_what_if_not/ while stating MSF was a ‚Äúuseful category for an already-existing genre of science fiction\\". Evans disagreed with MSF in that it was often \\"the wildest, least likely prognostications that come to pass‚Äù. She also criticized Ryman for disrespecting SF‚Äôs tradition of creating prophecies, thus influencing real life, which she stated means he ‚Äúcompletely misses the point of [science fiction]‚Äù. Commentary on MSF continued in the 2010s. In 2011 a Fantastic Worlds journal critic criticized the ‚Äúvery selective\\" use of science in MSF and its depressing nature. Fantastic Worlds, April 14, 2011 Selective Science for Mundane Fiction http://fantasticworlds- jordan179.blogspot.com/2011/04/selective-science-for-mundane-fiction.html In 2012, Emmet Byrne and Susannah Schouweiler called MSF the Dogme 95 of science fiction, a reference to a realist Danish film manifesto.https://walkerart.org/magazine/julian-bleecker-design-fiction-the- future-never-gets-old Julian Bleecker: The Future Never Gets Old, Emmet Byrne and Susannah Schouweiler, Oct 17, 2012 In 2013 Linda Nagata noted the relationship between hard science fiction and MSF, but stated, \\"the term 'mundane' has the 'implication of \\"boring'? To me, the term is another marketing disaster.\\"It's time to start reading hard science fiction again. Linda Nagata, 11/14/13 2:12PM https://io9.gizmodo.com/its-time-to-start- reading-hard-science-fiction-again-1464532911 Also in 2013, The New Museum's digital art arm Rhizome published Martine Syms' \\"The Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto\\". In 2019, Roger Luckhurst, a professor in Modern and Contemporary Literature at Birkbeck, University of London, stated the MSF movement was developed because writers did not want ‚Äú‚Ä¶to imagine shiny, hard futures [but [rather] give a] sense of sliding from one version of our present into something slightly alienated‚Äù. Literature In 2007 the British sci fi magazine Interzone devoted an issue to the subgenre, The 2009 short story collection When It Changed: Science Into Fiction, edited by Ryman, is a collection of mundane science fiction stories, each written by a science fiction author with advice from a scientist, and with an endnote by that scientist explaining the plausibility of the story.Material World, BBC Radio 4, 28 Oct 2009 In 2015 a reviewer from ‚Äò‚ÄôBoing Boing‚Äô‚Äô called Kim Stanley Robinson‚Äôs novel Aurora, a generation ship novel, MSF's \\"most significant novel‚Äù. In 2019 Robert Harris' The Second Sleep was described as the best MSF novel of the year. Films and television Christopher Cokinos in 2008 stated that films such as Gattaca, about a society based on genetic testing and ranking, and Moon, about a lonely mining operation on the Moon, \\"fit the Mundane Manifesto‚Äôs interest in near-future realism, even if they don‚Äôt directly deal with the beauties and heartbreaks of the Earth\\". Other examples Cokinos cited are French filmmaker Chris Marker‚Äôs Sans Soleil and the film version of Children of Men, which shows a \\"heart-wrenching film of a grim, near-future Earth\\". In 2019, UK television critic Hugh Montgomery identified MSF television series and films which are set in the near future and which use plausible technologies; his list includes Black Mirror; The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale (a dystopian drama set in a totalitarian, misogynist theocracy); Osmosis (about a dating app that requires a bodily implant for users); Years and Years (a family drama set over the next 15 years, in a world facing ecological disasters); and Children of Men.  Related genres  In Ritch Calvin's opinion, MSF shares ‚Äúcharacteristics with cyberpunk, postcyberpunk, and near- future science fiction‚Äù. For instance, William Gibson‚Äôs novels show a ‚Äúnear future urban‚Äù world, while Bruce Sterling‚Äôs Schismatrix depicts the impacts of global capitalism.

Fredericksburg proposal In 2001 a non-profit organization was founded in Fredericksburg, Virginia, to raise funds and campaign to establish a national museum on slavery in America. On October 8, 2001, Richmond Mayor Douglas Wilder announced his intention to build a National Slavery Museum in Fredericksburg, on 38 acres donated by the Silver Company at the Celebrate Virginia Retail and Tourism complex. The site overlooks the Rappahannock River and is located less than one mile from Interstate 95 (the principal North-South artery for the U.S. East Coast). Originally projected to open in 2004, the museum was to be part of the state's \\"Celebrate Virginia\\" development along the busy I-95 travel corridor between Richmond and Washington DC. In 2005 the Fredericksburg City Council set a deadline to begin construction by August 1, 2008, in order for the project to retain its special-use permit (allowing the planned building to exceed zoning restrictions on height.) The museum project made its last tax payment on May 15, 2008, and the following day the executive director wrote the City Council to request to delay construction for one year (until August 2009). In June 2008, appeared before the City Council to ask for an exemption to pay real- estate taxes (retroactive to 2002), but this request was denied on June 24, 2008, by a vote of 6-1. By the end of the year the project's leased offices in Fredericksburg were reported to be vacant. The local Fredericksburg newspaper reported in February 2009 that the offices had never had much staff beyond Executive Director Vonita Foster and one assistant. The museum was intended to have as its primary mission education, re-education, and policy formation regarding slavery in America and its enduring legacy. Former Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder is the museum project's founder. The project, effectively, died in 2008 due to its inability to raise sufficient funds to pay property taxes, let alone begin construction. On September 22, 2011, the organization filed for Chapter 11 protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Fredericksburg.Davis, Chelyen \\"Slavery museum files for bankruptcy\\", Fredericksburg.com, September 23, 21; accessed 28 October 2011.

Virginia tax authorities said the property became eligible to be sold as a tax sale on December 31, 2010. Official notification of the commonwealth's intent to sell the property was planned for late August 2011, but a tax official said it was unlikely \\"anything would really happen\\" for six months (until early 2012), and the planned tax sale would be dropped if taxes were paid.Richmond Times-Dispatch newspaper, Sunday August 14, 2011, Metro page B-2, \\"Slavery Museum Misses Tax Deadline\\"; accessed 14 August 2011. But then the organization filed for Chapter 11 protection in September, although it remains unclear if the purpose was reorganization or liquidation. On October 21, 2013, the Hagerstown Suns and Diamond Nation finalized an agreement to purchase the land of the proposed museum property. Under the deal, the city of Fredericksburg will receive $450,000 in back taxes owed from the US National Slavery Museum's failure to pay its taxes. Richmond plan The former Governor of Virginia, Bob McDonnell, committed 11 million dollars in state funds toward the 30-plus million needed to build a National Museum of Slavery in the Shockoe Bottom, in Richmond, Virginia. The proposed development project would include the museum, new business and residential properties, a Kroger grocery store, and a baseball stadium, intended to help improve a generally depressed area. The National Museum of Slavery would be built next to a slave graveyard and what is considered (after New Orleans) the second-largest slave trading station in U.S. history. In a February 10, 2014, Richmond City Council meeting, the council voted unanimously to commit $5 million to honor slave-history sites. This complemented the $11 million proposed by McDonnell. This deal did not include funding for a planned ballpark. However, according to columnist Michael Paul Williams, writing in the Richmond Times-Dispatch in June, 2015, \\"the idea went nowhere.\\" See also *National Slave Memorial *Slavery in the United States *List of museums focused on African Americans References External links * Douglas Wilder website Failed museum proposals in the United States Slavery in the United States Museums in Fredericksburg, Virginia African-American museums in Virginia Washington metropolitan area Slavery museums ","title":"United States National Slavery Museum"},{"id":"6384302","text":"Damascus (April 14, 1964 ‚Äì August 8, 1995) was a Thoroughbred race horse sired by Sword Dancer (1959's Horse of the Year) out of Kerala (by My Babu) foaled at the Jonabell Farm in Lexington, Kentucky. In 1967, he won the Preakness Stakes, Belmont Stakes*, Jockey Club Gold Cup*, Wood Memorial, Travers Stakes, Dwyer Stakes (closing from 12 lengths back and spotting the runner up 16 pounds), and Woodward Stakes and was named Horse of the Year and champion three-year-old colt, plus he shared the champion handicap male honors with Buckpasser. Also in 1967, Damascus finished third in the 1967 Kentucky Derby. A high-strung horse, he was enervated by the humidity and spooked by the crowd noise, so he was thereafter given a stable pony to calm him. During the same year, top horses Dr. Fager and Buckpasser were also competing. In Blood-Horse magazine's top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, Buckpasser ranks 14th and Dr. Fager ranks 6th. In a race many consider the \\"Race of the Century,\\" Damascus won the 1967 Woodward by 10 lengths over both of these horses after his connections, as well as those of Buckpasser, used stablemates to set a blistering pace, thus weakening Dr. Fager. Damascus himself ranks number 16 in the Blood Horse listing. Background Damascus was owned and bred by Edith Woodward Bancroft, whose father, William Woodward Sr., owned Belair Stud and won five Belmonts in the 1930s. Edith Bancroft inherited the famed Belair white silks with red polka dots and scarlet cap but never used Belair as a stable name. Damascus was trained by Hall of Famer Frank Whireley Jr. and ridden by Hall of Fame jockey Bill Shoemaker. Racing career Damascus won the Travers Stakes by 22 lengths, the Remsen Stakes, the American Derby while setting a track record, the Aqueduct Handicap against older horses and carrying top weight, the Leonard Richards Stakes, the Bay Shore Stakes, the Brooklyn Handicap (beating Dr. Fager, who had beaten him in the Suburban Handicap two weeks earlier), the William Dupont Jr. Handicap, the San Fernando Breeders' Cup Stakes, and the Malibu Stakes. He bowed a tendon while racing in his second Jockey Club Gold Cup, coming in last, which was the only time in his career he was out of the top three. Whiteley then retired him to stud.

He is of Samoan and MƒÅori descent and heritage, and he coaches the 1st XV for Saint Kentigern College.  Early life  Although born in Taihape, Lavea grew up in Auckland and was educated at Papatoetoe High School, then St Kentigern College where he played for three seasons in the 1st XV. He was an age-group representative between the ages of 14 and 16, and played for both the Auckland and New Zealand Secondary Schools teams in 1998. He also excelled in cricket. Career Lavea played fly-half for the Blues in Super Rugby from 2004 to 2006. He also played at inside centre for the Chiefs in the 2007 and 2008 seasons. In 2009 he rejoined the Blues. At provincial level, Lavea played for Auckland in the National Provincial Championship from 2003 through to 2007. He joined Counties Manukau in 2008. He played for French Top 14 team ASM Clermont Auvergne between 2009 and 2011.As announced by ASM Clermont Auvergne  Switch to Rugby League  Following secondary school, Lavea played for the Junior All Blacks and was then scouted by Melbourne Storm (despite never having played rugby league until signing), switching codes to play in Australia. Having won the 1999 Premiership, the Melbourne Storm travelled to England to contest the 2000 World Club Challenge against Super League Champions St Helens R.F.C., with Lavea playing from the interchange bench in the victory. Thanks to his prodigious goal-kicking skills, in 2000 he was the Melbourne Storm's leading points scorer (190 points) and was named the club's Rookie of the Year. After a quieter second season, in 2002 Lavea left Melbourne for the Northern Eagles but was hampered by injury and hardly featured in the team. Test Matches and Rugby League World Cup Lavea was a member of New Zealand's 2000 World Cup squad. Between 2000 and 2001, he played 4 test matches for the Kiwis in his usual rugby league position of stand-off. In the match against Cook Islands on 2 November 2000, Lavea's haul of 32 points (2 tries and 12 goals) broke the previous Kiwi record of 26 points (set by Henry Paul).  Return to Rugby Union  Lavea returned to New Zealand in 2003 and switched codes once again to play rugby union, signing with Auckland. His NPC debut was in that year, against Waikato. He then made his Blues debut in 2004 against the Reds and was part of the Blues for three seasons. In 2007 Lavea joined the Chiefs through the player draft, with whom he played two seasons, and in 2008 moved provinces from Auckland to Counties. In 2009 he returned to the Blues, however he made only four more appearances for the side in his final season of Super Rugby. He played a final season for Counties in the Air New Zealand Cup before moving to France.  2006 Rugby season  Following a mixed Super 14 season in 2006, Lavea was named in the New Zealand MƒÅori rugby union team. Due to an injury sustained in club rugby, he had to withdraw from the team before the Churchill Cup tournament even began. The New Zealand MƒÅori went on to take the title.  Air New Zealand Cup  Lavea was again selected as Auckland's principal fly-half as the province prepared to defend its title. Round One During Auckland's opening Air New Zealand Cup match against Manawatu (Saturday 29 July 2006), nearly all players suffered sand burns from the appalling ground conditions at FMG Stadium, Palmerston North. It played a part in Lavea's first-half hamstring injury, thereby ruling him out of the playing 22 for Auckland's games against Tasman (Sunday 6 August 2006), Taranaki (Saturday 12 August 2006), and Bay of Plenty (Sunday 20 August 2006). Lavea recovered to play the full 80 minutes for both the games against Wellington (Saturday 26 August 2006) and North Harbour (Friday 1 September 2006). In the \\"Battle of the Bridge\\" (Auckland vs North Harbour) Lavea performed admirably, kicking well to gain territory and making several significant runs. Round Two Lavea missed Auckland's first match in Round Two against Waikato (Saturday 16 September 2006) due to a calf injury. Recovering from the minor injury in time to be named in the starting 15 for the match against Otago (Saturday 23 September 2006),Lavea Looks Forward Lavea controlled the game expertly. He found space with his kicking game, set up an impressive manoeuvre for Isaia Toeava, and ran in a great solo try off a deft intercept. The Auckland fly- half also played solidly in the team's last Round Two match, against Canterbury (Saturday 30 September 2006). Auckland was denied a try in the very last play of the match which saw Lavea crash through the posts after a Doug Howlett offload. Controversially, referee Steve Walsh ruled that the pass was forward. Had Auckland been awarded that try, the result would have been a 27‚Äì27 draw, or a 29‚Äì27 win to Auckland if the conversion was successful. Both situations would have given Auckland the position of top seed going into the playoffs. Quarter-finals Auckland defeated Bay of Plenty for the second time this season in their quarter-final match-up on Saturday 7 October 2006. Lavea received a yellow card for a spear tackle at the start of the final quarter, but played the remainder of the match. Semi-finals Wellington defeated Auckland in the first 2006 Air New Zealand Cup semi-final on Friday 13 October 2006. Auckland's set-piece and handling errors meant Lavea could not get enough quality ball to capitalise on his team's expansive style of attack.  The Pacific Islanders squad  In September 2006, Lavea was named in the Pacific Islanders rugby union team (representing Samoa) to tour the United Kingdom and Ireland in November 2006. Although being named in the Pacific Islanders squad did not disqualify Lavea from playing for the All Blacks, the appearance of his name in the squad signified his possible allegiance to Manu Samoa in the future. At the time, Lavea stated that he felt it was time for him to take control of the future of his rugby career, and that opportunities lay with playing for the Pacific Islanders. If Lavea plays a test match for Manu Samoa, by IRB regulations he will become ineligible to play for the All Blacks. In a further development, it is understood that Lavea's contract with the NZRU stipulates his availability for All Blacks selection.Tasesa's poser ‚Äì to tour or not to tour? Even though recent All Blacks Sitiveni Sivivatu and Sione Lauaki both played for the Pacific Islanders and went on to get the black jersey, new PIRA rules seem to suggest that players can only be included in the Pacific Islanders squad if they declare allegiance to their respective Pacific Island national team (Fiji, Samoa or Tonga). While the possibility of playing for Samoa in the 2007 Rugby World Cup would be of great appeal to Lavea, declaring himself unavailable for All Blacks selection could be detrimental to his rugby career in New Zealand (because a player that is not NZ-eligible is of less value to the NZRU). At the time Lavea did not comment on whether this would affect his decision to tour. When the Pacific Islanders squad left for the UK on 2 November 2006, Lavea was not part of the squad. He withdrew from the team because Ian Foster, head coach of the Chiefs, requested for him to stay in New Zealand for pre- season training.Tusi Pisi called into Pacific Islanders Harbour fly-half Tusi Pisi was called in as Lavea's replacement in the touring squad, but Pisi's inclusion is understood not to have disqualified him for future All Blacks selection.  2007 Rugby season   Air New Zealand Cup  Lavea's present contract with Auckland will end on 31 October 2007. He is currently playing for Auckland in the 2007 Air NZ Cup, at the conclusion of which he will begin a new 2-year contract with Counties Manukau. Since that places him in the Chiefs catchment area, he is directly eligible to play for them in the 2008 Super 14. In early July 2007, Lavea travelled to Thailand for Auckland's pre- season training camp. However, due to an untimely hip flexor injury, he did not play until Week 9 of the 2007 Air NZ Cup season. Week 9 Lavea played first five in Auckland's match against Otago on Friday 21 September 2007.  Super 14  During the selection process for New Zealand's 2007 Super 14 teams, the Blues made Lavea available in the player draft, along with Auckland fullback Brent Ward and Harbour wing Viliame Waqaseduadua. The neighbouring Chiefs were glad to pick up Lavea for the coming season. Chiefs head coach Ian Foster indicated the possibility of developing Lavea and Stephen Donald's roles in the team to create a 10/12 combination. Lavea was also enthusiastic about playing for a new team.Lavea keen for resurgence at Chiefs Pre-season The Chiefs won 31‚Äì17 against the Hurricanes on Thursday 18 January 2007. Lavea was not initially named for this match because of a minor calf strain, but made a quick recovery and saw some game time in the second half. Week 1 The first match of the Chiefs' 2007 Super 14 campaign was a home game against the Brumbies (Saturday 3 February 2007). Starting on the bench at No.21, Lavea substituted on at second five-eighths for Tane Tu'ipulotu in the final quarter. Unfortunately, Lavea also injured his left knee in his Chiefs debut. MRI revealed a strained medial collateral ligament that was thought would keep him sidelined for at least six weeks.Lavea out for six weeks Week 7 Lavea recovered from the knee injury after five weeks and resumed full contact training with the team during the build-up to the Chiefs' week 7 clash with the Lions (Friday 16 March 2007). He started the match at second five- eighthsLavea fast-tracked back from injury to fill midfield spot and shifted to first five-eighths for the final quarter. The Donald-Lavea five-eighth combination proved to be effective, with the former scoring a brace of tries in the Chiefs' 34 ‚Äì 7 victory. Stephen Donald stated that having Lavea at second five-eighths allowed him to \\"have a crack\\", knowing that the next phase would be covered.Chiefs win at last Lavea made good use of tactical kicking throughout the match. This was Lavea's first starting position with the Chiefs.Lavea Gets First Chiefs Starting Spot Week 8 Lavea remained at second five-eighths for the entire match against the Reds (Saturday 24 March 2007), which the Chiefs narrowly won 21 ‚Äì 19. This victory has kept the Chiefs' semifinal hopes alive. Week 9 The Chiefs played against the Blues on Saturday 31 March 2007. Lavea played at second five-eighths opposite old teammates Luke McAlister and Sam Tuitupou. Halfway through the first quarter, Lavea appeared to have aggravated his knee injury from Week 1. Ten minutes later he bounced back to score the Chiefs' only try of the match ‚Äì his first try for the new team. However, the strain on his knee ruled out his selection for the Highlanders match in Queenstown on Saturday 7 April 2007. Week 11 In the Chiefs' 64 ‚Äì 36 victory over the Force (Saturday 14 April 2007), Lavea scored a try ten minutes into the second half from a Sitiveni Sivivatu offload. This bonus point win puts the Chiefs ahead of the Force in the race for a semifinal spot. Week 12 The Chiefs defeated the Sharks 35 ‚Äì 27 in their final round robin home game of the 2007 Super 14 (Saturday 21 April 2007). Lavea played both inside center and fly-half, scoring two tries in the first half of the match. Week 13 Lavea was substituted after the first quarter of the away match against the Waratahs (Friday 27 April 2007) due to a foot injury. He suffered Achilles tendinopathy and a hematoma on his chest, missing the match against the Crusaders in the final week of round robin matchplay.  From 2009 with Clermont Auvergne  Lavea signed for Clermont Auvergne in 2009. He mostly plays as a second choice at fly-half behind Brock James. He was called by Samoa national team for the first time in November 2010.

Swiss and Italian Influence Pasta was made in Hepburn Springs from 1865 The influence of the Swiss Italians of Australia - Italian speaking Swiss from the cantons of Ticino and Grison and the northern Italians - is still present in the township through the names of its residents, the names of its springs (Locarno) and buildings (Savoia Hotel, Parma House, Perinis, Bellinzona) and the annual Swiss-Italian Festa. The heart of the Italian speaking community was the area around the Savoia (Spring Creek) Hotel and the Macaroni Factory. The Savoia is named after the royal family of the unified Italy. An Italian reading library was located at the hotel and pasta was made opposite in Lucini's Macaroni Factory which was also home to the Democratic Club. Lucini's moved from Lonsdale Street, Melbourne in 1865, where they had set up as the first pasta factory in Australia in 1864. Vanzetta's bakery supplied bread and Crippa, Perini and the Gervasonis (Yandoit Creek) produced wine. A local delicacy is bullboar which is a sausage made from beef, pork, garlic and spices.Bullboar Young Gourmet information In 2005 Daylesford Secondary College came second in ABC's Young Gourmets by making bullboars from the Gervasoni and Sartori recipes which gained much media attention over the fate of Charlotte the pig, with little concern for the steer involved!

(2002) The historically important Murphy Branch is the westernmost part of what was the Western North Carolina Railroad, later the Richmond and Danville, Southern Railway, the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) and today the Blue Ridge Southern Railroad. The branch runs between Asheville, North Carolina in the east and Murphy in the west. It roughly follows I-40 from Asheville to Canton and US Route 74, also known as the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway, from Canton to Murphy. Grades on the Murphy Branch exceed 4.0% in two places.Saluda, Trains (retrieved 26 September 2014) History Constructed with convict labor between 1881 and 1894 under the charter of the Western North Carolina Railroad. The Murphy Branch would be important to the development of southwestern North Carolina in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It opened up the isolated and rural mountains west of Asheville to the outside world, allowing easy travel and improved commerce. It can easily be said with confidence that these tracks made Western North Carolina what it is today. In the 1980s, Norfolk Southern decided to close the Murphy Branch west of Sylva because of declining freight traffic. The NCDOT purchased the branch west of Dillsboro in 1988, the first purchase under NCDOT's program to preserve rail corridors, and granted trackage rights between Dillsboro and Andrews to the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad (GSMR), a tourist excursion railroad that also provides freight service. In 1996, the NCDOT sold the Dillsboro-Andrews portion of the Murphy Branch to the GSMR. In April, 2014 it was announced that Norfolk Southern would be selling the Asheville-Dillsboro leg of the Murphy Branch to Watco, a short line railroad headquartered in Pittsburg, Kansas. A new North Carolina Limited Liability Company was established and named the Blue Ridge Southern Railroad.Norfolk Southern sells railroad line to Kansas company, The Sylva Herald (retrieved 24 July 2014) The deal closed and operations began on 26 July 2014. The GSMR continues to own the Dillsboro to Andrews leg and operates all but the westernmost portion between Hewitt and Andrews. The NCDOT continues to own the tracks between Andrews and Murphy which has been out of service continuously since 1985.

Life and career There is uncertainty over when and where he was born. Many sources state that he was born Albert Clemens in 1887, in Kingsport, Tennessee. However, the researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc state that, based on information in official records, he was born Clarence Clemens in 1896 or 1897, in Burns, Tennessee, and may have been adopted as Clarence Ramsey. They also concluded that Albert (or Elbert) Clemens, born c.1903, who was also a singer and pianist who recorded for Bluebird Records, was his brother. Lofton was born with a limp, from which he derived his stage name, but he started his career as a tap dancer. He then began performing in the blues idiom known as boogie-woogie and went on to perform in Chicago, Illinois. The distinctive feature of his performances was his energetic stage presence; he would dance and whistle as well as sing. A description of Lofton in performance is provided by William Russell, in his essay \\"Boogie Woogie\\": > No one can complain of Clarence's lack of variety or versatility. When he > really gets going he's a three-ring circus. During one number, he plays, > sings, whistles a chorus, and snaps his fingers with the technique of a > Spanish dancer to give further percussive accompaniment to his blues. At > times he turns sideways, almost with his back to the piano as he keeps > pounding away at the keyboard and stomping his feet, meanwhile continuing to > sing and shout at his audience or his drummer. Suddenly in the middle of a > number he jumps up, his hands clasped in front of him, and walks around the > piano stool, and then, unexpectedly, out booms a vocal break in a bass voice > from somewhere. One second later, he has turned and is back at the keyboard, > both hands flying at lightning-like pace. His actions and facial expressions > are as intensely dramatic and exciting as his music.\\" With his distinctive performance style, Lofton became a mainstay in his genre. His first recording was made in April 1935 for Vocalion Records with guitar accompaniment by Big Bill Broonzy.Olderen, Martin van (1979). Clarence's Blues. Liner notes. Oldie Blues OL 2817. Lofton also accompanied Red Nelson on several sides for Decca Records in 1935 and 1936. He later went on to own the Big Apple nightclub in Chicago and continued to record into the late 1940s, when he retired. Lofton lived in Chicago for the rest of his life. He died of a blood clot in his brain in Cook County Hospital in 1957. Influence Lofton was an integral figure in the boogie-woogie genre in Chicago. Some of his more popular songs include \\"Strut That Thing\\", \\"Monkey Man Blues\\", \\"I Don't Know\\" and \\"Pitchin' Boogie\\". His talent was likened to that of Pinetop Smith and other prominent boogie-woogie artists, including Meade Lux Lewis, Cow Cow Davenport and Jimmy Yancey.

It was established in 1950 and took over two of the three main gas utilities in Melbourne - the Metropolitan Gas CompanyAustralian Science at Work: Metropolitan Gas Company and the Brighton Gas Company. As part of the conversion to natural gas, in 1971 the corporation acquired the Geelong Gas Company, one of only two remaining private gas companies in Victoria at the time. The Ballarat Gas Company closed at the time. The G&FC; was wound up in June 1995. Consolidation  One of the first tasks of the corporation was the construction of a centralised brown coal fueled gasification plant at Morwell.Gasworks Arts Park - History The Lurgi Gasification Plant opened in Morwell in 1956, which used the German Lurgi process to produce gas, that was transferred to Melbourne via a high pressure gas pipeline.Technology in Australia 1788-1988 Construction of the Morwell plant led to the closure in 1957 of a number of town gas producing gasworks scattered throughout Melbourne and elsewhere, such as the South Melbourne Gas plant, some of which became gas storage sites. The production of Syngas started in the 1950s, which is a process that converted waste gases from oil refineries to a useful energy product. In 1966, 30% of gas was being produced from residual oil, 30% from refinery gas and LPG, 30% from Lurgi gas, and less than 10% by carbonization of black coal. Natural gas was discovered in Bass Strait by Esso and BHP in 1965. The Longford gas plant acted as the onshore receiving point for oil and natural gas output from production platforms in Bass Strait. By 1969 the production plant and distribution network were complete, allowing natural gas to be sold to consumers, and a natural gas conversion program took place over the next 20 months, ending in December 1970. The conversion to natural gas required the conversion of around one million gas appliances, and resulted in over 1,000 workers becoming redundant. All the gas plants and storage sites in Melbourne and regional centres were closed down and the sites sold. Privatisation and winding up In July 1997 the Gas and Fuel Corporation was broken up into three divisions: gas distributor and retail companies, a gas transmission company and an independent market operator, VENCorp. The Kennett Government subsequently privatised the distribution, retail and transmission companies, along with the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, Victoria's main electricity utility. The G&FC; was wound up in June 1995. Gascor acted as a gas wholesaler, purchasing gas from Esso/BHP-Billiton and on-selling it to private sector gas retailers Origin Energy, AGL and TXU. The corporation's headquarters, the Princes Gate Towers on Flinders Street, built in 1967, were demolished in 1997 to make way for the Federation Square development.

Butts, 388 U.S. 130 (1967), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court establishing the standard of First Amendment protection against defamation claims brought by private individuals. Background The case involved a libel lawsuit filed by former Georgia Bulldogs football coach Wally Butts against The Saturday Evening Post. The lawsuit arose from an article in the magazine that alleged that Butts and Alabama head coach Bear Bryant had conspired to fix games. The Butts suit was consolidated with another case, Associated Press v. Walker, and the two cases were decided in one opinion. In finding for Butts but against Walker, the Supreme Court gave some indications of when a \\"public figure\\" could sue for libel. Decision In a plurality opinion, written by Justice John Marshall Harlan II, the Court held that news organizations were protected from liability when they print allegations about public officials. However, the Supreme Court's New York Times Co. v. Sullivan decision (1964) lets them still be liable to public figures if the information that they disseminate is recklessly gathered and unchecked. The Court ultimately ruled in favor of Butts, and The Saturday Evening Post was ordered to pay $3.06 million to Butts in damages, which was later reduced on appeal to $460,000. The settlement was seen as a contributing factor in the demise of The Saturday Evening Post and its parent corporation, the Curtis Publishing Company, two years later. Both Butts and Bryant had sued for $10 million each. Bryant settled for $300,000.

It is located in the Westland District of the South Island's West Coast region and opened to Hokitika in 1893. A further extension to Ross operated from 1909 until 1980.  Construction  The first line opened in the region was a bush tramway built to a gauge of 1,219mm (4 ft). It ran from Greymouth south to Paroa and opened in 1867. Ten years later, an extension inland to Kumara was opened, with the Taramakau River crossed by a cage suspended from a wire. Around this time, plans were formulated to replace the tramway with a railway and link Greymouth and Hokitika. Work began in 1879, but the economic conditions of the Long Depression brought construction to a halt the next year with only 5 km of track laid. Furthermore, the residents of Kumara, led by future Prime Minister Richard Seddon, were indignant that the railway was going to take a more coastal route than the tramway and thus bypass their town. In 1886, work restarted, and the continued attempts from Kumara residents to have the line's route changed failed to force an alteration to the plans. Work progressed steadily over the next few years, and on 18 December 1893, the complete line from Hokitika to Greymouth opened.David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, revised edition (Wellington: Grantham House, 1998 [1995]), 60-1. Premier Seddon Hokitika-Ross railway, West Coast, ca 22 Jan 1906 To the south of Hokitika was thickly wooded country, and with the prospect of significant logging traffic, surveys for an extension of the railway were undertaken. In 1901, the government approved construction of the extension, and preliminary work was well underway by August 1902.William Hall- Jones, \\"The Public Works Statement\\", Otago Witness (24 September 1902), 28. The first section, from Hokitika to Ruatapu, was opened on 9 November 1906, and the full line to Ross was completed on 1 April 1909. Proposals for further southward extension were made but never came to fruition. One of these involved linking Ross to the Otago Central Railway (which at the time terminated in Omakau) via the Haast Pass and Wanaka, and this proposal was viewed favourably by Richard Seddon during his Prime Ministership in the early 20th century as a tourist route.\\"The Dense Forests and Snow-Fed Streams of the West: Ross to Wanaka via the Haast Pass\\", Otago Witness (24 January 1906), 57. Despite the failure of the railway to progress beyond Ross, a number of bush tramways fanned out from the railway to provide more convenient access to sawmills and other industrial activity. The most notable of these was the one owned by Stuart and Chapman Ltd, which extended south from Ross for about 20 km to the Lake Ianthe area.

Operation  The road/rail bridge over the Arahura River. Note signage for the Hokitika Industrial Line Although sometimes considered to be part of the Midland Line, the Ross Branch was almost wholly operated as a separate route from Greymouth. The 1906 timetable showed 2 or 3 passenger trains a day. Locomotive depots were established in both Ross and Hokitika, and when the Otira Tunnel linking the West Coast to Canterbury opened in 1923, the section to Hokitika began to increase in importance. Carriages from the Christchurch-Greymouth express were attached to mixed trains and conveyed to Hokitika while the extension to Ross operated more like a local line with two mixed trains daily. The introduction of small Leyland diesel railbuses in August 1936 to convey copies of the Christchurch Press newspaper to the West Coast led to the establishment of a direct service between Christchurch and Hokitika, as well as local services between Hokitika and Greymouth and briefly Reefton.Pahiatua Railcar Society, \\"Early New Zealand Railcars\\" , accessed 4 November 2007. By the early 1940s, the Vulcan railcars had replaced the Leylands and they ran all the way through from Christchurch to Ross, operating twice daily, with a Greymouth-Hokitika return service at mid-day, Monday to Friday. In 1955, the 88 seater railcars entered service in New Zealand, and on 20 February 1956, they began operating the services from Christchurch to Ross via Greymouth, significantly reducing the use of the Vulcans. They were augmented by two daily mixed trains to Ross, and these services lasted until 11 September 1967. The railcars operated for a few years more, but as of 9 October 1972, they ceased to run past Greymouth, removing the final passenger service on the line. Taramakau road/rail bridge opening In the early years of the line, timber was the dominant traffic from Ross, and in the 1920s, there was some pressure to operate NZR rolling stock on the Stuart and Chapman Ltd tramway, but this came to nothing and the tramway used private rolling stock until its closure in 1959. As the forests were felled, they were not replaced, and agriculture grew in importance, with agricultural lime and fertiliser railed in and livestock railed out; Ross served as the loading point for cattle driven up from southern Westland. By the 1970s, the line beyond Hokitika was operating uneconomically, and closure came in 1980. The combined road/rail bridge south of Hokitika, known as the \\"longest xylophone in the world\\" in New Zealand railfan jargon due to the rattling its planks made, required urgent repairs but it was decided that the cost outweighed the benefits due to the insignificance of the line. Road traffic was diverted to another bridge upstream and the line from Hokitika to Ross closed on 24 November 1980. The road bridge opened in 2018, leaving the only road-rail bridges in the country on the Taieri Gorge Railway This made the closure of the Ross section somewhat remarkable as its passenger service had ceased only eight years earlier; most rural New Zealand branches lost their passenger service at least two or three decades before the entire line was closed. Presently, the Hokitika Branch operates quietly but appears to have a secure future. Every weekday, a freight train operates from Greymouth to Hokitika in the morning and returns in the evening. It takes fifty minutes to run each way, operates only when required between June and August, and no trains run on weekends.Toll Rail, Working timetable, effective 17 June 2007, accessed 4 November 2007. The branch's primary customer is the Westland Milk Products plant based in Hokitika, and trains are typically operated by diesel locomotives of the DBR or DC classes. In the days of steam locomotives, members of the A and AB had been based in Ross, and when the line was dieselised in May 1969, DJ class diesels became the primary motive power until the arrival of the DBRs and DCs, though for a few years in the 1970s, all trains had to be operated by DSC class shunter locomotives before the Taramakau River bridge was repaired and upgraded. The bridge closed to road traffic on Sunday 22 July 2018, when a $25m road bridge opened.  The Hokitika-Ross section today  A few notable bridges, sans rails, still stand on the route to Ross, including an impressive truss bridge over the Totara River just north of Ross itself and a smaller truss bridge over the Mahinapua Creek 5 km south of Hokitika that is now protected by the New Zealand Department of Conservation. The route between Ruatapu and Ross is largely out of sight from the road, but can be driven for much of its length and is used as an accessway by some locals. From Hokitika to Ruatapu, the railway's formation is readily apparent as it is often near the road, and the road has even been diverted to use portions of it. Little else remains of the railway due to the passage of time and influence of human and natural activity, but at the site of Ross's yard, some twisted rail and a loading bank remain. In March 2010 work was started on clearing the Ruatapa - Ross section for use by cyclists.Greymouth to Ross Track Ground Effect, March 2010 However, the long- term future of this is somewhat in doubt due to gold prospecting in the area.Victory Alluvial Gold Project, Superior Mining, November 2009 A number of bridges still exist in this section and are being refurbished as part of the cycle track.Midland Line - Other Lines NZ Rail Maps website, May 2010 The West Coast Wilderness Trail from Hokitika to Ross, which incorporates the former railway route from Ruatapu south, opened on 24 October 2015.

It was so-named after Charles V of France, who resumed the war nine years after the Treaty of Br√©tigny (signed 1360). The Kingdom of France dominated this phase of the war. The Black Prince, eldest son and heir of Edward III of England, spent a huge sum of money in order to restore Peter the Cruel to the throne of Castile. The Castilian King was unable to repay him, however, so the Black Prince raised the taxes in his domains in Aquitaine. The people's complaints were unheeded, so they appealed to the French King Charles V. In May 1369, the Black Prince received summons from the French king demanding his presence in Paris. The prince refused, and Charles responded by declaring war. He immediately set out to reverse the territorial losses imposed at Br√©tigny and he was largely successful in his lifetime. His successor, Charles VI, made peace with the son of the Black Prince, Richard II, in 1389. This truce was extended many times until the war was resumed in 1415. Background In the Treaty of Br√©tigny, Edward III renounced his claim to the French throne in exchange for the duchy of Aquitaine in full sovereignty. Between the nine years of formal peace between the two kingdoms, the English and French clashed in Brittany and Castile. In the War of the Breton Succession, the English backed the heir male, the House of Montfort (a cadet of the House of Dreux, itself a cadet of the Capetian dynasty) while the French backed the heir general, the House of Blois. Since Brittany allowed female succession, the French considered the Blois side to be the rightful heir. The war began in 1341, but the English continued backing the Montforts even after the Peace of Br√©tigny. The English- supported claimant John of Montfort defeated and killed the French claimant, Charles of Blois, at the Battle of Auray in 1364. By that time, however, Edward III no longer had a claim to the throne of France, so John had to accept the suzerainty of the French king in order to hold his duchy in peace. Thus, the English derived no benefit from their victory. In fact, the French received the benefit of improved generalship in the person of the Breton commander Bertrand du Guesclin, who, leaving Brittany, entered the service of Charles and became one of his most successful generals. With peace in France, the mercenaries and soldiers lately employed in the war became unemployed, and turned to plundering. Charles V also had a score to settle with Pedro the Cruel, King of Castile, who married his sister-in-law, Blanche of Bourbon, and had her poisoned. Charles V ordered Du Guesclin to lead these bands to Castile to depose Pedro the Cruel. The Castilian Civil War ensued. Du Guesclin succeeded in his object; Henry of Trast√°mara was placed on the Castilian throne. Having been opposed by the French, Pedro appealed to the Black Prince for aid, promising rewards. The Black Prince succeeded in restoring Pedro following the Battle of N√°jera. But Pedro refused to make payments, to the chagrin of his English and Navarrese allies. Without them, Pedro was once more deposed, and lost his life. Again the English gained nothing from their intervention, except the enmity of the new king of Castile, who allied himself with France. The English merchant community that had been established in Seville was massacred on Henry's order. Between 1372 and 1380, Castilian corsairs raided the southern coasts of England with relative impunity, turning the tide in the Hundred Years' War decisively in France's favour. The Black Prince's intervention in the Castilian Civil War, and the failure of Pedro to reward his services, depleted the prince's treasury. He resolved to recover his losses by raising the taxes in Aquitaine. The Gascons, unaccustomed to such taxes, complained. Unheeded, they turned to the King of France as their feudal overlord. But by the Treaty of Br√©tigny the King of France had lost his suzerainty over Aquitaine. After reflecting on the matter, it was asserted that Edward III's renunciation of France had been imperfect. In consequence, the King of France retained his suzerainty over Aquitaine. Charles V summoned the Black Prince to answer the complaints of his vassals but Edward refused. The Caroline phase of the Hundred Years' War began. French Recovery French recovery of lost territories Charles V resumed the war in favorable conditions. France, after all, was still the foremost kingdom in Western Europe; England had also lost its most capable military leaders ‚Äî Edward III was too old, while the Black Prince was languishing in sickness. Just before New Year's Day 1370, the English seneschal of Poitou, John Chandos, was killed at the bridge at Lussac-les-Ch√¢teaux. The loss of this commander was a significant blow to the English. Jean III de Grailly, the captal de Buch, was also captured and locked up by Charles, who did not feel bound by \\"outdated\\" chivalry. Du Guesclin continued a series of careful campaigns, avoiding major English field forces, but capturing town after town, including Poitiers in 1372 and Bergerac in 1377. Du Guesclin, who according to chronicler Jean Froissart, had advised the French king not to engage the English in the field, was successful in these Fabian tactics, though in the only two major battles in which he fought, Auray (1364) and N√°jera (1367), he was on the losing side and was captured but released for ransom. The English response to du Guesclin was to launch a series of destructive military expeditions, called chevauch√©es, in an effort at total war to destroy the countryside and the productivity of the land. But du Guesclin refused to be drawn into open battle. He continued his successful command of the French armies until his death in 1380. In 1372, English command of the sea, which had been kept since the Battle of Sluys, came to an end at La Rochelle. An English fleet carrying supplies and reinforcements for the English forces in Aquitaine was destroyed by the Castilians who had cannon and who sprayed oil on the decks of the English ships and then fired flaming arrows to ignite it. This defeat undermined English seaborne trade and supplies and isolated their Gascon possessions. John of Gaunt's Great Chevauch√©e In 1373 John of Gaunt commanded what historians call the Great Chevauch√©e. It was launched between two epidemics of the Black Death in 1369 and 1375. The economic impact of the Black Death was devastating, and John of Gaunt was having difficulty financing his French campaign. According to chronicler Jean Froissart the Chevauch√©e had been planned for three years. English armies were known for their devastating capability in chevauch√©e warfare. The chevauch√©e or \\"war-ride\\" involved leading an army through enemy territory and burning manors, mills and villages. This wore away the enemy's tax revenues and undermined political support. Using this tactic, the English could strike and withdraw before the enemy could respond. This tactic had helped Edward III and his son, The Black Prince, force a surrender in the Edwardian Wars. The English forces were ambushed by one of France's most effective commanders, Olivier de Clisson. In the frontier lands between King Charles V's domains and the Duchy of Burgundy, 600 English and Bretons were killed and many others were taken prisoner. When the English tried to cross the rivers Loire and Allier in October, they lost most of their baggage train and transport. According to the Grandes Chroniques de France the English had little provisions, and had lost many men and most of their horses. Even after the chevauch√©e had left Burgundian territory, the Duke of Burgundy continued to watch their movements closely, and there was fierce fighting between French and English forces. When John of Gaunt's forces finally reached Bordeaux on Christmas Eve in 1373, they were half-starved and weary. Grandes Chroniques de France says the chevauch√©e had lost most of their men and many knights had lost their armor because they were unable to carry them. The Great Chevauch√©e was over. The Great Chevauch√©e's defeat caused tremendous anger and resentment in Britain. John of Gaunt continued to be a powerful political player, but he was not popular and his efforts to promote peace with France were unsuccessful. Treaty of Bruges The Treaty of Bruges was a treaty signed in 1375 between France and England in Bruges, present-day Belgium. The conference leading to the treaty was called at the instigation of Pope Gregory XI.Cannon. Treaty of Bruges 1375. The Oxford Companion to British History France was represented in the negotiations by Philip II, Duke of Burgundy and England by John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. Negotiations broke down over the issue of sovereignty over the Aquitaine. The English wanted full sovereignty over Edward's territories, while the French insisted that the House of Valois retain sovereignty of any Plantagenet provinces. Despite attempts by the Pope to broker a compromise, agreement could not be reached and the war resumed in 1377. In 1376, the Black Prince died, and in April 1377, Edward III of England sent his Chancellor, Adam Houghton, to negotiate for peace with Charles, but when in June Edward himself died, Houghton was called home. Glanmor Williams, ‚ÄòHoughton, Adam (died 1389) ‚Äô, in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004), online edition, May 2008 (subscription required), accessed 4 December 2010 The underaged Richard of Bordeaux succeeded to the throne of England. It was not until Richard had been deposed by his cousin Henry Bolingbroke that the English, under the House of Lancaster, could forcefully revive their claim to the French throne. The war nonetheless continued until the first of a series of truces was signed in 1389. France at the truce of 1389 Charles V died in September 1380 and was succeeded by his underage son, Charles VI, who was placed under the joint regency of his three uncles. With his successes, Charles may have believed that the end of the war was at hand. On his deathbed Charles V repealed the royal taxation necessary to fund the war effort. As the regents attempted to reimpose the taxation a popular revolt known as the Harelle broke out in Rouen. As tax collectors arrived at other French cities the revolt spread and violence broke out in Paris and most of France's other northern cities. The regency was forced to repeal the taxes to calm the situation. The Great Schism In 1378 Charles V's support for the election of the Avignon Pope Clement VII started the Great Schism. This event split the Church for almost four decades and thwarted papal efforts to prevent or end the Hundred Years' War. The disputed papal succession resulted in several lines of popes competing for the support of national rulers, which exacerbated the political divisions of the war. Despite papal involvement in peace conferences throughout the 14th century, no settlement was ever reached, in part because the papacy was not influential enough to impose one.

It has both elementary and high school departments as well as kindergarten and preparatory school (known in the school as \\"prep\\") classes for younger students. The school follows the Benedictine tradition of Ora et Labora, which means \\"Prayer and Work\\".http://www.andropampanga.com/churches/angelescity_church.htm HFA is a Catholic Institution belonging to the Archdiocese of San Fernando, Pampanga and administered by the Missionary Benedictine Sisters. It is registered with SEC as a non-stock, non-profit corporation, with its assets and income used directly and exclusively for educational purposes including expansion when needed to carry out the aims and objectives of the school. History Holy Family Academy (HFA) was established on August 20, 1906 as the first Catholic parochial school of Angeles City through the initiative of Fr. Pablo Gamboa and the assistance of the Board of Directors of the Parochial School in Angeles City composed of Mariano V. Henson, Juan G. Nepomuceno, Sr., Laureano Suarez, Filomeno Leon Y. Santos, Basilio Henson and Jose P. Henson. Located at the present site of the Holy Rosary Parish rectory, the school offered a primary course and was run by lay teachers who were paid out of contributions.http:// www.and ropampanga.com/churches/angelescity_church.htm The Augustinian Sisters In 1910, the Augustinian Sisters took over and set up the Colegio de la Sagrada Familia with the help of the same Board of Directors. The colegio offered a complete elementary education and accepted female boarders.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07407c.htm Some time later, as the student population of the colegio increased, Jose P. Henson and Juan Nepomuceno Sr. initiated the school's expansion. They bought land and built a house that became the parish hall and the residence of succeeding parish priests. The Colegio de la Sagrada Familia moved to the present site of the Administrative Building of HFA. The Missionary Benedictine Sisters In June 1922, the Missionary Benedictine Sisters took over the management of the school upon the invitation of the parish priest Msgr. Pedro P. Santos and changed the school's name to \\"Holy Family Academy\\". The Benedictine Sisters did not take in boarders but actively attended to the supervision and administration of the school. The first group of Missionary Benedictine Sisters headed by Sister Crescentia Veser were Germans in 1925, with the appointment of Sister Pacifica Gerding as first resident superior, the Benedictine Sisters at Holy Family Academy became a juridical community. Holy Family Academy continued to operate during the Japanese occupation period, closing only for a few months during the change of political administration and reopened its doors soon after the end of World War II. As of the school year 2012-2013, the school is under the leadership of Sister Josefina Nepomuceno OSB and have just recently celebrated its centennial. The Opening of the High School Department In 1960, HFA opened the High School Department exclusively for girls. The growth in population of Angeles City brought about an increase in the enrolment of HFA resulting in crowding and congestion in the old campus beside the Holy Rosary Parish Church on Sto. Rosario St. In search of a solution to growth problems, Sister Mary Bernard Lansang, OSB, superior/directress in 1983, together with concerned Renato Tayag, Jr. initiated the formulation of a foundation. This was realized during the term of Sister Ildephonsa Pineda, OSB as superior/directress and Mr. Florante Timbol as PTA president in the incorporation of the HFA-PTA Foundation with the occurrence of Oscar V. Cruz, then Archbishop of San Fernando. High School Campus in Cutcut (New Site)  With the involvement of parents, alumni and other supporters through membership contributions and fundraising activities, the HFA-PTA obtained a five-hectare lot in Cutcut along the Circumferential Road. The four-phase building program was started. In 1987, phase one was completed, enabling the transfer of the 1st Year students to the new campus. Boys were then accepted in the high school. By 1988, phase two was completed, and two more year levels moved over. In 1991, with the completion of phase three, the entire High School settled in the new site, the Cutcut campus. With the support of the HFA Alumni Association, the covered court was partially constructed. This was completed in 1997. The new Pedro Calungsod Building that housed the audio visual center, the library and the canteen was completed in December 2002. In the Cutcut campus, the High School Department occupies the Sto. Ni√±o Building, the San Lorenzo Building, the San Pedro Calungsod Building and the covered court. In the old site at Sto. Rosario St., the Preschool and Grade School occupy the following multi- story buildings: St. Benedict with the Auditorium, St. Joseph's, St. Mary's, the H.E. Building and the Main Building. As of 2014, the Department of Education (DepEd) approved the K-12 Curriculum to be implemented in Holy Family Academy. Construction began in 2014 for the Senior High Building. In 2016, the Senior High building was finished. It is the newest building in the campus, located in the New Site. Its purpose is to provide more learning facilities for Senior High school students (Grades 11 and 12). Academic affiliation HFA is a member of the Association of Archdiocesan and Parochial Schools of Pampanga (AAPSP), the Association of Benedictine Schools (ABS), the Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines (CEAP), and the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU). Students' English Proficiency Students of Holy Family Academy graduate with fluency and proficiency in the use of the English language. They carry- out a yearly project called \\"Speak English Campaign\\" wherein students are encouraged to use English in their daily conversations with others even in their respective homes. In the grade school department, the best English Speakers are given recognition by having their names published in the schoolpaper Cor Unum. School Activities The school observes most major Catholic holidays particularly those associated with the founder of the Benedictine Order, Saint Benedict. First Friday Holy Masses are also celebrated, and the students are required to attend. Students in the old site celebrate Holy Mass at the nearby Holy Rosary Parish Church, Angeles City's oldest while those who are in the new site, particularly High School students celebrate theirs in the Covered Court of the school. There are also quite a number of extracurricular activities that are observed by the school, some of which aren't observed regularly, a few of these are: *Organization of Clubs ‚Äì students join a particular club that holds activities for a certain point of interest, for example, Math Club, Science Club, Young Writers' Club, and the like. Clubs vary for grade school and high school departments. Preschoolers are not allowed to join clubs *Ecology Month ‚Äì observed as a month of appreciation for Mother Earth, similar to the Earth Day celebrations *Ecology Week ‚Äì A week in the Ecology Month used for the culminating activities such as the Science Quiz Show and the Tree Planting at Cutcut Farm *Academic Weeks ‚Äì week-long activities devoted to a particular academic subject taught in the school, e.g. Math Week, Physics Week, History Week and the like *Recollections and Retreats ‚Äì an integral part of the spiritual life of students in the school *Rosary Month ‚Äì celebrated throughout the month of October.

Both the grade school and high school department publish a version of the newsletter. Popular by its tagline \\"One Heart\\", the Cor Unum exists as a venue for students to practice freedom of speech and as an area to voice out their concerns. It follows the common format of a student newsletter, with Opinions, editorials, news features, entertainment clippings, literary works, trivia and the like.http://allabout.com.ph/cor-unum-official- student-publication-of-hfa/ The newsletter selects its editorial board from the pool of students of Holy Family Academy.

When founded, Manual Arts was a vocational high school, but later converted to a traditional curriculum. History Manual Arts High School was founded in 1910 in the middle of bean fields, one-half mile from the nearest bus stop. It was the third high school in Los Angeles, California after Los Angeles High School and L.A. Polytechnic High School, and is the oldest high school still on its original site in the Los Angeles Unified School District. The school that would eventually become Lincoln High had been founded decades earlier but was still an elementary school at this time. One of the school's first teachers was Ethel Percy Andrus (1911 - 1915). In 1916 Dr. Andrus became California's first woman high school principal at Lincoln High School in East Los Angeles. She later founded AARP. After three semesters in an abandoned grammar school building, Manual Arts High School was opened on Vermont Avenue. After the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, the entire campus was rebuilt, constituting the present Manual Arts High School campus adjacent to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and USC. In 1995, \\"The Arts\\" became a Pacific Bell Education First Demonstration Site joining thirteen other demonstration sites in California, and in 1996 the school was named a California Distinguished School. In 1998, Manual Arts was officially granted Digital High School status. The 2005‚Äì2006 school year opened with small learning communities (SLCs), three on each track totaling nine SLCs. Manual Arts was relieved by the opening of Santee Education Complex in 2005. West Adams High School The school was relieved in 2007 when West Adams Preparatory High School opened. During the same year, a section of the Manual Arts attendance zone was transferred to Belmont High School. In July 2008, the school became part of MLA Partner Schools through LAUSD's newly created iDesign Schools Division. MLA Partner Schools, in collaboration with West Ed, will operate Manual Arts on a 5-year performance contract approved by the LAUSD School Board. The school was expected be relieved by Central Region High School 16 (which became Dr. Maya Angelou High School (Los Angeles, California)) when that school opened in 2011, and by Augustus Hawkins High School when that school opens in 2012. In the 2011‚Äì2012 school year, Manual Arts will return to a traditional school calendar schedule. As a result, several of the school‚Äôs small learning communities will be restructured and the number of security on campus will be reduced. The 'Blewett Football Field is named in honor of James Blewett who was a standout Manual Arts football player and longtime Head coach with 9 Los Angeles City titles and 225 wins. Student body The racial make-up of the school is mostly Latinos and African-Americans and the neighborhood surrounding the school reflects the same make-up. During the 2004‚Äì2005 school year, MAHS had 3,766 students, including: * 3,054 Hispanics (81.1%) * 701 African-Americans (18.6%) * 5 White Americans (1%) * 4 Asian Americans (1%) * 2 Native Americans (1%) As of 2010, the dropout rate at Manual Arts was 68%. With more than 90% of students qualifying for free or reduced lunch provided by the Los Angeles Unified School district.

USS Birgit served as a commissioned ship for 16 months. Birgit (AKA 24) was laid down on 22 February 1944 at Providence, R.I., by Walsh-Kaiser Co., Inc., under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1885); launched on 18 July 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Ella A. Cunard; and commissioned on 28 October 1944, Comdr. Gerald J. Burke, USNR, in command. Service history 1944 Following fitting out at Boston, Mass., the attack cargo ship sailed for the Chesapeake Bay in mid-November. After shakedown training, the new attack cargo ship entered the Norfolk Navy Yard late on 4 November for repairs and alterations. This work was completed at the end of the month, and she sailed for Bayonne, N.J. on 30 November. There, the ship loaded cargo and embarked passenger, before sailing for the Pacific on 6 December. Escorted by , Birgit steamed to Panama, transiting the canal on the 12th and leaving the Canal Zone very early on the 13th. Proceeding singly to Hawaii, the ship reached Pearl Harbor on Christmas Day 1944, after having paused en route to render medical aid to SS S. B. Hunt on the 21st. 1945 After disembarking her passengers and discharging her cargo, the ship shifted to Honolulu on 5 January 1945 and immediately began loading cargo for the Army's 752d Anti Aircraft (AA) Battalion. On the 7th, she embarked 235 soldiers attached to the unit, and sailed independently for the Marshall Islands on the 8th. Reaching Eniwetok on the 16th, Birgit tarried there for a week, topping off her fuel bunkers from before leaving the lagoon on the 23d for a round-trip voyage to Saipan and back. The attack cargo ship made Saipan on the 27th and returned to Eniwetok on 3 February. At this point, turbine damage forced Birgit to return to Hawaii for repairs. She set sail alone on 5 February, reached Oahu on the 15th, and entered the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard on the 19th. Following this availability, Birgit trained near Maui, practicing amphibious landings and tactical maneuvers between 24 March and 29 March. The attack cargo ship then returned to her cargo hauling duties, taking on board freight at Honolulu on the 30th and embarking 235 soldiers on 1 April. Sailing that afternoon for the Marshalls and Marianas, Birgit visited Eniwetok from 10 April to 11 April and Saipan from 14 April to 28 April before she discharged her remaining cargo at Guam on the 28th. This task completed, she sailed for Eniwetok and, for almost four months, served the Commander, Marshalls Gilberts Area, making interisland cargo runs to such places as Eniwetok, Kwajalein, Majuro, and Tarawa. While Birgit performed the prosaic, but vital, cargo-carrying tasks in the rear areas, the Allied war effort came to a victorious conclusion, sped along by two atomic bombs. V-J Day found Birgit at Eniwetok atoll. On 22 August, after taking on fuel from , the attack cargo ship got underway for the Philippines as part of 5th Fleet's Amphibious Group 8 and arrived at Guiuan Roadstead off Samar on the 29th. She then sailed for Manila on 4 September and reached that port late on the 6th. Three days later, Birgit sailed for Lingayen Gulf, routed via Subic Bay, and anchored off Aringay Point on 10 September. There, she loaded 785 tons of ammunition, vehicles, gasoline, and rations, completing the evolution early on the 15th. She then embarked 225 men of the Army's 33d Infantry Division. Birgit took part in a landing rehearsal at Aringay Point on the 17th and then sailed for Japan on the 20th. Birgit navigated the 600 yard swept channel passing through Kii Suido between Shikoku and Honsh≈´ and arrived off Wakayama before dawn on 25 September. Reaching her assigned position off the beachhead at 06:23, Birgit lowered her landing craft, getting them all waterborne within 10 minutes. Then, she proceeded to the inner anchorage area, where she anchored at 10:25. An hour later, she started discharging cargo, using her landing craft. Still, lack of lighterage kept the unloading moving slowly for the balance of the day. The supply of boats improved on the 26th and Birgit's cargo operations speeded up correspondingly. By 17:30, she had unloaded her cargo and disembarked her troops. Birgit's part in the occupation completed, she weighed anchor on the 27th, sailing for Leyte in company with , and . Routed via Subic Bay, Birgit reached Leyte's San Pedro Bay on 5 October, tarrying there briefly before shifting south to Mindanao, anchoring in Davao Gulf on the 8th. There, the attack cargo ship embarked 135 men of the Army's 21st Regimental Combat Team and loaded 795 tons of cargo. Clearing Davao Gulf on 15 October, Birgit headed back to Japan, arriving at Hiro Wan, off Honsh≈´, on late the 21st. She unloaded her cargo and disembarked her troops at Matsuyama early on the 23rd. At that point in time, Birgit joined the armada of ships assigned to Operation \\"Magic Carpet\\" duty, as she lay in Hiro Wan. Sailing for Okinawa on the 30th, she reached Buckner Bay on 1 November and embarked 407 returning servicemen the following afternoon. She weighed anchor for the United States shortly thereafter and arrived at San Francisco on 17 November. After repairs at the Kaiser dockyard at Richmond, California, Birgit sailed for the Philippines on the 25th, making Guiuan Roadstead at Samar on 13 December. Two days later, Birgit sailed for San Francisco once more with 478 homeward bound men and reached her destination on New Year's Day 1946. Decommissioning Released from \\"Magic Carpet\\" duty on arrival in San Francisco, the attack cargo ship was soon authorized for disposal. Sailing from the west coast on 28 January 1946, Birgit headed for the Gulf Coast and inactivation. Clearing the Panama Canal on 11 February, she finally reached Orange, Texas, on 10 March via New Orleans. Birgit was placed out of commission at Orange on 15 March 1946, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 21 May 1946. The ship was delivered to the Maritime Commission on 1 July 1946 at Mobile, Alabama, for further disposition. While specific information on her fate has not been found, records suggest that she was sold and scrapped sometime in the 1970s.

It is followed by To Light a Candle. Plot Seventeen-year-old Kellen Tavadon has lived his whole life in Armathelieh, the Mage City. The son of Arch-Mage Lycaelon Tavadon, Kellen is expected to become a Mage by Armathelieh's citizens. However, fate has different plans for him. Stumbling through the City's Low Market, he comes upon three mysterious books ‚Äî the books of the Wild Magic , an art forbidden by the High Mages. When Lycaelon searches his room and finds the books, Kellen is accused and convicted for the practice of Wild Magic. He is forced from the city by an Outlaw Hunt ‚Äî a rare event orchestrated by the Mages of the Council to look like banishment , but actually a cover-up for murder. Kellen casts a Wild Magic spell asking for help in escaping the Outlaw Hunt. The Wild Magic grants him a unicorn named Shalkan who agrees to help Kellen on the condition that he remain chaste and celibate for a year and a day. Seeing little choice, Kellen agrees. After he and Shalkan fight off the stone hounds of the Outlaw Hunt, both are badly injured and seek refuge at the home of a Wild Mage named Idalia. Idalia happens to be Kellen's older sister who also was banished by their father. She takes him in and teaches him about Wild Magic. Meanwhile, the demons, led by Queen Savilla, want to conquer the world of light. Savilla does this by trying to get the elves and humans to fight. Her son Prince Zyperis tells a spy for the council that Kellen has escaped and is learning wild magic from his sister. The council then decides to extend its border to where Idalia and Kellen live. Idalia, Shalkan and Kellen are forced to move into Elven lands, while the other folk (sylphs, dryads, fauns, pixies, gnomes, and centaurs) have to go north towards the mountains. As Kellen, Idalia, and Shalkan approach the Elven lands, Kellen notices that the woods are different from the wild wood and there are no other folk. When Kellen meets the elves he thinks they are perfect in every way. Their beauty and their whole civilization seem perfect. When they first arrive at their new home Kellen meets Jermayan, who loves and is loved by Idalia. However, she does not want to be with him because he will live for hundreds of years and she will die. Jermayan does not care, but Idalia rejects him. While Kellen is exploring he meets a young elf, Sandalon, who happens to be the prince of the elves and takes him to his mother, Queen Ashaniel. While she is there she tells him that a drought has happened. Idalia then learns this is not a natural drought. When she tries to summon water by wild magic it is rejected. The drought is a magical drought; someone is stopping the water. Idalia learns that the demons are the ones causing the drought. She believes she can fix it but she and the elves will have to pay a price. Then someone will have to go to the place the spell is being held and put a keystone with the counter spell and change it. Kellen has to do that because when the drought is broken huge storms will come and Idalia is need to slow and stop the spells and Kellen and Idalia are the only wildmages in elven lands. Kellen goes with only Jermayan and Shalkan. They journey into the mountains were the demons live to stop the counter spell. As they are traveling Jermayan teaches Kellen how to become a knight when he learns that Kellen is a knight-mage, making him an excellent fighter, but only an average wild mage. When several human and centaur bandits attack them, Kellen kills for the first time and is terribly upset. Jermayan is mortally wounded and Kellen heals him with wild magic, during which the gods of wild magic tell him \\"you will know what to do when the time comes\\" and Jermayan is healed but weak. Meanwhile, Kellen learns from Jermayan of the Great War. The elves, humans, and wild folk fought against the demons. Kellen learns that there were wild mages that did not want to pay their price so they joined the demons. Each had mighty dragons on both sides, and many races of the light were lost forever. As they get closer, the price in which Kellen paid for healing Jermayan leads him to someone harassing a girl. Kellen engages the man, deciding against drawing his sword against the man's club, instead using his armored gauntlets to knock him unconscious. Then Kellen realizes that the girl he saved looks like a demon. Jermayan sees her and tries to kill her but Kellen protects her. While they are fighting Shalkan walks up to her and touches her with his horn. If a demon touches a unicorn horn they die. Jermayan stops fighting Kellen and only accepts her because Shalkan threatened to kill him. The girl, Vestakia, says she can lead them to the barrier where the spell is being held. She can sense where demons and demon magic are. She then tells the story of how her mother was a Wild Mage who unknowingly slept with a demon in human guise. When she found out, she called on the wild magic for help and was given a choice: her child could be born human but with a demon nature, or a demon with a human nature. Both choices would cost twenty years of life. She took the second option and fled with her sister into hiding. Vestakia finally leads them to the mountain where the barrier is held. Vestakia, Kellen, Jermayan, and Shalkan ascend the mountain to find an obelisk. Kellen has to climb up it to position the counter-keystone while the others are weak because of the demon magic. As Kellen climbs up a demon army of goblins comes, and Vestakia, Shalkan, and Jermayan fight them off. During the battle, Jermayan learns to trust Vestakia and saves her life. Meanwhile, Kellen realizes he is going to die by going up there. He wishes he never left the golden city and learned wild magic. He realizes that he didn't miss the city itself, but what it could have been. A place of honor, justice, and law, and he misses the fact that he used to think it was. He ascends the staircase to the top of the obelisk, and is surprised to confront a doppelganger of himself. The doppelganger attempts to persuade him to give up his mission, to try to convince him of returning to Armathelieh. He tells him to renounce the three books, beg for his father's forgiveness, and he can take his father's throne to make the city how he wants it. Kellen almost accepts, but realizes it is all a trick. He slams the counter-keystone into the obelisk, starting the spell that will eventually shatter it. When he does, Doppelganger Kellen turns into the Demon Queen and disappears. Kellen's hands burn from holding the counter-keystone in place, and he thinks he's going to die from the pain. He collapses when the obelisk is destroyed, and the goblins flee. Back in elven Lands, Idalia knows that she sent Jermayan and Kellen to their deaths. Then she feels the magic of the barrier being destroyed. She summons the wild magic, hesitating on the price but accepts to control the weather patterns as the storms built up from being stopped by the barrier. It transforms her into something big and she flies into the storm and controls it. Three days later, Ashaniel finds Idalia unconscious in a field. Kellen wakes up with Vestakia, Shalkan, and Jermayan all next to him and finds it raining. He feels really weak, and his hands hurt badly and are bandaged. As the book ends the Demon Queen is furious and Kellen's tutor Anigrel talks to her and she tells him what to do in the golden city.

He has great respect for Kellen Forms of magic In this fictional world there are three types of magic: Wild Magic, High Magic, and Demon Magic. Wild Magic Wild Magic is forbidden by the High Mages of Armethelieh. Within the city, it is taught to be a form of magic that corrupts the practitioner which attracts demons, and eventually turning them into one. It is revealed that Wild Magic was once used widely but became banned because of the stipulation which its use demands. It is known to be unpredictable when used, and requires a mage price from the practitioner. When casting spells, the price for the spell has to be agreed upon between the caster and the source of the Wild Magic. The more specific a request is, the more costly the mage price will be. To avoid a higher personal cost, Mages could offer to share the price amongst other individuals or creatures within the vicinity of the spell. They could also use a key stone, a battery, charged by their own or someone else's magical energies in place of a personal cost. Wild Magic is unable to heed any evil or malicious intent; whoever calls on it to do evil will suffer. A Wild Mage is a practitioner of Wild Magic. An individual does not decide whether to become a Wild Mage or not, rather, the Wild Magic chooses those people who are worthy to become bearers of the 3 Books of Wild Magic, in which the mages' tutelage begins. The three books are known as The Book of Sun, The Book of Moon, and The Book of Stars. Once the Wild Magic decides upon a bearer of the book, the owner and books will never separate in any circumstance unless the Wild Mage forfeits their ownership. Knight-Mages are a rare form of Wild Mage only produced on times of dire need. Although the Knight Mage would also have in their possession the 3 books of Wild Magic, it is different from the regular Wild Mages' books that it calls unto itself information for the owner pertinent to his/her position. There is only one Knight Mage currently existing in the series, that being Kellen Tavadon. High Magic This is a form of magic that was created by the High Mages to replace the unpredictable Wild Magic, or so it was thought until it was revealed that the wild magic created war magic (which would later become high magic) to help defeat the endarkened. It was created due to the stigma of Mage Price placed upon the Mages by use of Wild Magic. It is well-structured, heavily relying on spell forms traced upon the air by wands, and also writing and planning spell forms upon scrolls. Unlike Wild Magic, it seemingly negates the mage price demanded upon the practitioner by substituting it with the energy stored within city talismans. Practitioners of High Magic are known as High Mages. The ability to become a Mage is genetic, with the ability being passed down from generation to generation‚Äîthese individuals are known as being Mageborn. It is also known that once in a while, an individual with magical ability is born to a non-Mage family. To progress through the ranks of the Mages, the students of magic must go through a strict course of study spanning many years. They are taught that women are a distraction and are only good for producing their children, thereby continuing the mageborn line. It is taught that females lack the capacity to understand and perform magic properly, so there are only male Mages within the city. The progression of a city mage is as follows: Student, Apprentice, Journeyman, Undermage, Mage, High Mage, Arch- Mage. Demon Magic This type of magic is practiced by the Endarkened, also known as demons. This form of magic relies on the fears and pain of living beings. There is no real structure to this form of magic‚Äîthe stronger the gathered up fear/pain is, the stronger and more plentiful demon magic can be. Mage price Mage price is the payment demanded when magic is used and is attributed to the use of Wild Magic. Mage price, like Wild Magic, is unpredictable. It can take on the form of using up a practitioner's stamina, causing them to be exhausted. Mage price can also take on the form of a task which the practitioner must undergo‚Äîfor example, it could be the price of saving a cat from falling out of a tree, or cleaning a cistern (both of which were exacted from the protagonist upon his journey). It is also possible for the Wild Magic to ask of the practitioners their very lives. Mage price must be paid; if it is not paid, there are dire consequences. The amount of time that the Mage Price must be paid varies; it could be immediately, within a couple of months, or could take years to complete. Key stones Every spell has a Mage Price set upon the practitioner of magic. If the Wild Mage has to perform a simple spell and does not wish to take upon himself a personal cost, he has the option of using a key stone. A Key Stone could be said to be a magical battery charged by the practitioner of magic or by the energies of other creatures. Any inanimate object can be charged as a key stone, but for ease of use and transport, smaller objects such as stones are used. It is useful when performing small spells. If the caster would like to perform a greater spell, either several key stones must be used and if it isn't enough, then a personal cost or group cost must be paid. City talismans Within the city of Armethelieh, every citizen of the city must wear a golden City Talisman. This object signifies that the individual wearing it is a full citizen of the city and is therefore entitled to the rights and privileges attributed to its wear. What is known only to the Mages and not the general public, is that the Talismans also serve as batteries of magical energy. They slowly drain the, for most of the members of the city, unused magical energies housed in every creature. Every new moon, by law of the city, the Talismans must be turned in to the temple and replaced with a new Talisman. This is the source of the Mages' power, circumventing the need to take upon themselves the personal costs of using their magic. The Mages see it as their right to take and use without the citizens knowledge, because the City and its citizens benefit so much from the magics. It is similar to the key stones used by Wild Mages with the difference being that the key stones are charged by the individual or by other creatures freely, and the city absorbs the powers without the citizens' consent.

It followed and modified the Partition of Babylon made in 323 BC upon Alexander's death. Following the death of Alexander, the rule of his empire was given to his half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus and Alexander's son Alexander IV. However, since Philip was mentally ill and Alexander IV born only after the death of his father, a regent was named in Perdiccas. In the meantime, the former generals of Alexander were named satraps of the various regions of his empire. Several satraps were eager to gain more power, and when Ptolemy I Soter, satrap of Egypt, rebelled with other generals, Perdiccas moved against the former but was killed by a mutiny in his camp. Ptolemy declined the regency and instead brought to the office Peithon and Arrhidaeus. This designation met the strong opposition of Eurydice, wife of Philip III, leading, in the meeting called in 321 BC at Triparadisus of all the generals, to their replacement with Antipater. The meeting also proceeded to divide again the satrapies between the various generals. The treaty Arrian described the result of the meeting in Events after Alexander, which were transmitted to us by the patriarch Photius (820‚Äì897): \\"Then and there Antipater made a new division of Asia, wherein he partly confirmed the former and partly annulled it, according as the exigency of affairs required. For, in the first place, Egypt with Libya, and all the vast waste beyond it, and whatever else had been acquired to the westward, he assigned to Ptolemy; * Syria to Laomedon of Mytilene; * Cilicia to Philoxenus, for he held it before. * Among the higher provinces, Mesopotamia and Arbelitis were bestowed on Amphimachus, the king's brother; * Babylonia, on Seleucus; * the prefecture of all the province of Susa, on Antigenes, who was captain of the Macedonian Argyraspides, and had first opposed Perdiccas. *Peucestas was confirmed in his government of Persis. *Tlepolemus in Carmania, *and Peithon in that of Media, as far as the Caspian Gates. *Philip in Parthia. *Stasander in Aria and Drangiana. *Stasanor the Solian, over Bactria and Sogdiana; *and Sibyrtius over Arachosia. *The country of the Parapamisians was bestowed upon Oxyartes, the father of Roxana; *and the skirts of India adjacent to Mount Parapamisus, on Peithon the son of Agenor. *As to the countries beyond that, those on the river Indus, with the city Patala (the capital of that part of India) were assigned to Porus. *Those upon the Hydaspes, to Taxiles the Indian; for it was deemed no easy matter to dispossess those who had been confirmed in their territories by Alexander himself, their power was grown so strong. *Of the countries to the northward of Mount Taurus, Cappadocia was assigned to Nicanor; *Phrygia, Lycaonia, Pamphylia, and Lycia, as before, to Antigonus. *Caria to Asander; *Lydia to Cleitus; *and Hellespontine Phrygia to Arrhidaeus. Antigenes was deputed collector of the tribute in the province of Susa, and three thousand of those Macedonians who were the most ready to mutiny, appointed to attend him. Moreover, he appointed Autolychus the son of Agathocles, Amyntas the son of Alexander and brother of Peucestas, Ptolemy the son of Ptolemy, and Alexander the son of Polyperchon, as guards to surround the king's person. To his son Cassander he gave the command of the horse; and to Antigonus, the troops that had before been assigned to Perdiccas, and the care and custody of the king's person, with order to prosecute the war against Eumenes.

An ice hockey stick is a piece of equipment used in ice hockey to shoot, pass, and carry the puck across the ice. Ice hockey sticks are approximately 150‚Äì200 cm long, composed of a long, slender shaft with a flat extension at one end called the blade. National Hockey League (NHL) sticks are up to 63 inches (160 cm) long. The blade is the part of the stick used to contact the puck, and is typically 25 to 40 cm long. Stick dimensions can vary widely, as they are usually built to suit a particular player's size and preference. The blade is positioned at roughly a 135¬∞ angle from the axis of the shaft, giving the stick a partly 'L-shaped' appearance. The shaft of the stick is fairly rigid, but is slightly elastic to improve shot performance. The blade is slightly curved to aid control of the puck, especially in shooting. The direction of the curve depends on the side of the body the player wields the stick on. The goaltender has a slightly modified stick. The lower part of the stick is wider, the angle is smaller, and the blade is slightly curved towards the direction of the play. New goaltender sticks also are made of the same composite technology as used in regular sticks.  History  Mi'kmaq making Mic-Mac hockey sticks from hornbeam trees (Carpinus caroliniana) in Nova Scotia about 1890. The oldest known hockey stick dates to the mid-1830s; it was made by William \\"Dilly\\" Moffatt (born 1829) from sugar maple wood and is now owned by the Canadian Museum of History. In 2006, a stick made in the 1850s, at the time the oldest known, was sold at auction for $2.2 million; it had been appraised at US$4.25 million. The Moffatt stick may have been made by Mi'kmaqs. Starting in the 18th century, there are numerous references to the Mi'kmaq people of Nova Scotia playing ice hockey, and starting in the 19th century, there are claims that they invented the ice hockey stick. In the mid-19th century, the Starr Manufacturing Company began to sell Mic-Mac hockey sticks nationally and internationally.Cuthbertson, p. 61. Through the first decade of the 20th century, it was the best-selling hockey stick in Canada. By 1903, apart from farming, producing them was the primary occupation of the Mi'kmaq on reserves throughout Nova Scotia, particularly Shubenacadie, Indian Brook and Millbrook. In 1927 the department of Indian Affairs for Nova Scotia identified that the Mi'kmaq remained the \\"experts\\" at making hockey sticks.Cuthbertson, p. 73. Mi'kmaq continued to make hockey sticks until the 1930s.Cuthbertson, p. 63. Zdeno Ch√°ra, the NHL's tallest player ever at , has a special exemption to use a shafted stick. Hockey sticks were mostly made from the maple or willow trees, which was also a common choice for golf club shafts and wooden tools. However, as hornbeam supplies diminished, it became more cost effective to use other hardwoods, such as yellow birch and ash. Ash gradually became the preferred medium, and by the 1920s an ash hockey stick crafted from a single piece of wood was the type most commonly used. These early sticks were extremely heavy and not very forgiving, although they were extremely durable (Hall of Famer Moose Johnson famously used the same extra-long stick, which gave him a reach, his entire career). There were only a handful of major developments in hockey stick technology between the 1920s and the 2000s. Foremost among these was creation of the laminated stick in the 1940s, where layers of wood were glued together and sandwiched to create a more flexible and durable design. In the 1960s, companies began adding another lamination of fiberglass or other such synthetic compound as a coating, which further added to the durability and usability of the stick. Also in the 1960s, players began curving the blade of the stick, which dramatically changed the physics affecting players' shots. In the 1970s, cricket and baseball bat manufacturers began experimenting with lightweight steel alloys as a replacement for the traditional willow or ash bat. Hockey stick designers followed suit in the early 1980s, introducing first a single piece all-aluminum stick. This design was not popular, as the stiff aluminum did not have the proper \\"feel\\", and so a design featuring an aluminum shaft and a removable, replaceable wooden blade was tried. This became very popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s, challenging the prevalence of the traditional wooden stick for the first time. In recent years, the aluminum stick, as well as its wooden counterpart, have largely been replaced by more advanced composite designs. Common building materials include fiberglass and carbon fiber. Composite sticks generally weigh less than their aluminum forebears, and they can be manufactured with more consistent (and varied) physical properties than their wooden counterparts. They are, however, considerably more expensive than wooden sticks, and are not as durable as the older aluminum sticks. Materials Over the last two decades, there have been tremendous advances in the material technology used to create hockey sticks. The vast majority of sticks are made with one or more of the following materials: *Carbon Fiber *Fiberglass *Wood *Aluminum Carbon Fiber Carbon fiber has become by far the most common building material for sticks used in the NHL. Carbon fiber sticks were originally sold as shafts alone, much like their aluminum counterparts but nowadays, most hockey sticks are \\"one piece\\" sticks. The first company to successfully develop, produce and market \\"one piece\\" carbon fiber composite sticks was Composite Busch SA out of Switzerland in 1992. Carbon fiber sticks are ideal due to their light weight and favorable mechanical characteristics. They are generally accepted to be able to store and release elastic potential energy predictably and efficiently, however, There is ongoing debate over whether the mechanical characteristics of composite sticks makes for more powerful shots. Compared to other materials, carbon fiber sticks tend to be break more easily and cost more. Fiberglass Fiberglass was the first composite stick material, initially used with wood. Some sticks made solely from fiberglass have been produced but today, fiberglass is most commonly used as a composite with other materials, such as wood, carbon fiber, and/or kevlar. Wood Wooden sticks are usually constructed by laminating multiple types of wood into a high quality plywood, then coating the stick and blade with thin plastic or fiberglass. Some manufacturers use fiberglass as a laminate between wood layers. Today in the NHL, almost no players still use wooden sticks. The main advantage that wooden sticks enjoy today is their low cost. This makes them a popular choice for street hockey. Their main disadvantage that wooden sticks suffer from is their relative inconsistency. Wood has a tendency to warp, and over time its flex and stiffness properties will change. Additionally, being a natural material, wood also creates variations in production (even between identical patterns). Aluminum Aluminum sticks were the first non-wood sticks to appear. Most aluminum sticks consist of a shaft made of an aluminum alloy and a wooden blade or composite blade, which is held in the shaft by glue and the compression of the shaft itself. There was a brief period in the 1990s when the majority of NHL players used aluminum sticks, but today nearly all players use composite sticks. The main advantage aluminum sticks enjoy is their unparalleled durability. It is fairly rare for an aluminum shaft to be broken or damaged, even at the professional level, and since the blades can be easily replaced, a shaft will typically last for a relatively long period of time. Aluminum sticks will not suffer wear or warping like a wooden stick, and they can be manufactured with high consistency. Aluminum sticks, however, are not as elastic as other materials. Properties Lie The lie of a stick refers to the angle between the shaft and the blade. A lie value of 5 corresponds to a 135¬∞ angle, and each additional lie value corresponds to a 2¬∞ smaller angle. With the bottom of the blade flat on the ice, a higher lie value corresponds to a more upright shaft. Typical values range from 5 to 7; most sticks now are near 5.5. Goalie sticks typically have a lie between 11 and 15. Players usually seek a lie that will put the blade flat on the ice while they are in their typical skating stance. Hall of Fame center Wayne Gretzky, for example, used a stick with a low lie to correspond with his deep skating crouch and shorter height, whereas Hall of Fame defenceman Rod Langway used a stick with a very high lie number as he was very tall and tended to skate in a very upright position. Flex Warrior stick with a flex of 50. Hockey stick shafts, much like golf club shafts, are highly flexible, and this flexibility is a key component in their performance. Flex, bend, stiffness, and whip are all terms used to describe the amount force required to bend a given stick shaft a certain amount. With most composite and aluminum sticks, their flex characteristic is correlated numerically. This number, which ranges from 40 through 160, is printed on the stick and corresponds to the amount of force (in pounds-force) that it takes to deflect or bend the shaft one inch. For example, is required to bend the shaft and would be labelled \\"100 flex\\". The flex rating of a stick applies to its original length and increases if it is cut to a shorter length. Stick flex is viewed as a very important characteristic by most players. Commonly, defencemen seek stiffer flex shafts, as their greater stiffness imparts more force on slap shots and improves stick-checking. Forwards will commonly seek more flexible shafts, as they require less force to bend and are thus better suited to create quick and accurate wrist shots, as well as improving passing and stickhandling. Flex is also correlated to player strength; stronger players will often prefer stiffer flexes, as they have a sufficient amount of strength to fully bend (and thus maximize potential energy) using such shafts, whereas younger players and players with less strength will generally have more success using more flexible shafts which they are capable of bending to their optimal degree. Blade shape Until the early 1960s, hockey stick blades were typically not curved. However, in the late 1950s, New York Rangers center Andy Bathgate began experimenting with \\"breaking\\" his stick blades to impart a curve, which he found made his slap shots behave in highly erratic ways. Soon after Chicago Black Hawks forwards Stan Mikita and Bobby Hull stumbled onto the \\"broken blade\\", and subsequently began asking their stick manufacturers to create sticks with pre-curved blades. Soon after, much of the NHL, and Hull in particular, became a proponents of the \\"banana blade\\", or stick with extreme amounts (often up to ) of curve in the blade. These curves made slap shots behave very erratically, and in an era in which goalies did not wear masks, this eventually became an unacceptable danger. By 1967, the NHL began to limit the amount of curve a stick blade could legally have. In the NHL today, the legal limit is 19 mm, or of an inch. Much like the shaft's flex, a blade's shape is a very important characteristic of a stick's performance. There are three primary variables in blade design: curve, face angle, and toe. The curve refers to the basic amount the blade curves from toe to heel, as well as the part of the blade where that curve is located. A \\"toe curve\\" means that the curve is concentrated near the toe of the blade, and it is usually preferred by forwards, who seek better puckhandling and more accurate wrist shots. A \\"heel curve\\" is generally better for slap shots, and is thus used more by defencemen. Face angle is the angle between the ice surface and the front surface of the blade (this characteristic is comparable to the difference between the different irons in golf). A more \\"open\\" blade means that the face of the blade is turned up more sharply, and thus will cause a higher trajectory than a \\"closed\\" face angle. The toe shape refers to the basic shape of the end of the blade, and it is typically either round or square. Square toes make it easier to pull a puck off the boards or to do \\"toe drags\\" (stickhandling moves using the toe of the blade), whereas round toes make it easier to \\"flip\\" the puck, and also offer slight advantages in basic puckhandling. Blades also differ in length and thickness, based on player preference. =Illegal curves= The curve of a blade is limited at most levels of competitive hockey, generally to an amount between . Hasty measurements can be made by attempting to roll a dime under the j blade placed face down on the ice, but accurate measurements require a \\"stick gauge\\" which measures curve precisely. Currently, the NHL limits blade curvature to . Being caught using an illegal stick is typically punished with a two-minute minor penalty. The genesis for this rule was the \\"banana blade\\" of the 1960s. At the height of this era, players would often simply cross the blue line and let fly with a slap shot, hoping that the bizarre behavior of the puck would beat the goaltender. In this era, goaltenders were irritated by the danger such wild shots posed to them and in response, the NHL began gradually reducing the amount of curve a blade could legally have. In the modern game, the emphasis on shooting accuracy has largely eliminated any preference for extreme blade curves. However, hockey still retains illegal stick rules, which has become a cause of debate. The argument is that since blade curvature does not impart any significant advantage, that penalizing it is unnecessary. Additionally, coaches have used the \\"illegal equipment\\" penalty at key moments in games to win a power play, and in some cases, swing the momentum of an entire series, including the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals.

Plot summary Blood of the Yakuza is a campaign setting and scenario package for use with Oriental Adventures. The module describes the Japanese-style island of Wa and the port of Nakamura, detailing the history, politics, districts, architecture, and important personalities of the Tokugawa-era town. The module contains information on the rival Yakuza gangs and the political machinations of the important families and temples, as well as background on the major NPCs of the city, plus lists of names, occupations, and personalities for detailing minor non-player characters. Narratives are provided, rather than presenting the adventures as straightforward encounter plots, and depending on their character classes and backgrounds, the player characters can interact with the stories in many different ways. As the module was based on the Kara Tur boxed set, its information is older than the information about Wa found in such product lines as the Spelljammer series. Publication history Blood of the Yakuza was written by David \\"Zeb\\" Cook, with a cover by Jim Holloway, and was published by TSR in 1987 as a forty-eight page book and a sixteen-page book, with a large color map and an outer folder. Reception Jim Bambra reviewed Blood of the Yakuza for Dragon magazine No. 134. Bambra felt that the island of Wa \\"draws its inspiration from the Tokugawa Shogunate of Japan and presents a more centralized and less war-torn period\\".

The drawings were originally believed to be the Blackfriars theatre. The Cockpit was a theatre in London, operating from 1616 to around 1665. It was the first theatre to be located near Drury Lane. After damage in 1617, it was named The Phoenix. History Enlarge The original building was an actual cockpit; that is, a staging area for cockfights. Most likely a round building with a peaked roof, about in diameter, it was erected under Henry VIII, c. 1530-32, as part of a gaming complex. Records indicate a major restoration in 1581-82 and renovations in 1589-90, 1602-3, and 1608-9 (the latter under the supervision of John Best, \\"cockmaster\\" to Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, King James I's eldest son and heir).Gurr and Orrell, p. 142. In August 1616, Christopher Beeston acquired the lease to the building and converted it to an indoor playhouse.Wickham, p. 117. In March 1617, gangs of apprentices attempted to destroy the playhouse, probably out of anger that their favorite plays had been removed from the Red Bull outdoor amphitheater, which charged only one penny for admission, to this more expensive (six-penny) venue. Beeston's rapid restoration of the playhouse after this riot may be why it was sometimes called the Phoenix. Like earlier theatres, such as The Theatre in Shoreditch and The Globe in Southwark, the location was just outside the jurisdiction of the City of London. Beeston expanded the original small building; the construction work prompted complaints by neighbors, which left traces in the legal records of the time.Gurr and Orrell, pp. 142-3. The resulting theatre was, by one estimate, by , \\"noticeably smaller than the Blackfriars.\\"Gurr, Shakespearean Stage, pp. 24-25. The architect commissioned for the renovation is not known for a certainty, but circumstantial evidence points to Inigo Jones. Two sheets drawn by Jones and showing the interior and exterior design of some theatre have survived; John Orrell makes the case that the theatre is the Cockpit, while allowing that he cannot produce conclusive evidence to that end.Shakespeare Survey 30, p. 157. (In 1629, Inigo Jones would design another \\"Cockpit\\" theatre, a private one within Whitehall called the Cockpit-in-Court or Royal Cockpit.) Beeston intended the Cockpit to serve as an indoor complement to the Red Bull, the outdoor theatre then home to his acting troupe, Queen Anne's Men. A winter venue was needed to compete with the Blackfriars Theatre in the possession of their rival troupe, the King's Men. After a rocky start, the company proved successful in their new locale. Wickham attributes the success more to the theatre's location and comfort and to the flair of its manager, Beeston, than to the quality of its performers.Wickham, p. 118. Beeston would oversee several different troupes in the Cockpit before his death in 1639. Queen Anne's Men were there from 1617 to 1619; when that company dissolved upon the death of Anne of Denmark in 1619, their place was taken by Prince Charles's Men from 1619 to 1622. Lady Elizabeth's Men were there from 1622 to 1624, and perhaps for sporadic periods as early as 1619 (the two companies, Prince Charles's and Lady Elizabeth's, had combined for a time ca. 1615). Queen Henrietta's Men had a long run at the Cockpit, from 1625 to 1636. The last troupe to occupy the Cockpit in Beeston's lifetime was one of his own creation, the King and Queen's Young Company, colloquially known as Beeston's Boys -- the last assembly of boy actors in the period. They would continue in the theatre under the management of his son William.Thomson. p. 225; Harbage, p. 356. William Beeston was forced out of the theatre when his choice of plays met with the disapproval of the Court. He was replaced by William Davenant in 1639. All theatres were closed by Parliament in 1642, under the Commonwealth. The Cockpit was used as a schoolroom, but plays continued to be shown illegally. It was raided by Puritan soldiers during a performance in 1649 and the players were imprisoned. In 1651 William Beeston paid ¬£200 for repairs to the theatre, in the hope that he would be able to start performances there again -- though the hope proved illusory.Gurr and Orrell, p. 146. In the last years of the English Interregnum, under the common conceit that music was not acting, Davenant was permitted to present two licensed operas in the Cockpit: The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru in 1658 and Sir Francis Drake in 1659.Thomson, p. 225. The theatres were permitted to reopen after the English Restoration in 1660, when Charles II granted Letters Patent to two companies to perform \\"legitimate drama\\" in London: the Duke's Company, led by Davenant, and the King's Company, led by Thomas Killigrew. Both companies briefly made use of the earlier generation of theatres including the Cockpit and the Salisbury Court Theatre, but quickly moved to newer and more fashionable venues -- Davenant in 1661 to a theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields that was once Lisle's Tennis Court, and Killigrew in 1660 to Gibbon's Tennis Court in Vere Street. The Cockpit was also used in this era by the companies of John Rhodes and George Jolly. Samuel Pepys wrote in his diary of several visits to the theatre between 1660 and 1663. In 1663, Killigrew's King's Company opened the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane nearby. The Cockpit was unable to compete with this relatively grand new theatre and was further hamstrung since it was shut out of the monopoly on \\"legitimate drama\\" granted to the two patent companies. There is no record of any play being mounted at the Cockpit after 1665; the eventual fate of the structure is unknown. The Phoenix was located in the middle of the area bounded today by Drury Lane, Great Queen Street, Great Wild Street, and Kemble Street. The entrance to the theatre was in Cockpit Alley, which ran from Drury Lane to Great Wild Street; the present-day Martlett Court is off Drury Lane roughly opposite where the entrance to Cockpit Alley was.Berry, 623.

He was a humanitarian who worked with philanthropic and Christian groups; he founded the United States Christian Commission during the American Civil War. He also worked with the U.S. government to try to help freedmen and Native Americans. Early life and education Colyer was born in the Bloomingdale, New York and grew up in a Quaker family. His faith was the center of his life and the inspiration for many of his activities. He studied art for four years in New York with John R. Smith, and then was a student at the National Academy. He became an associate member of the National Academy of Design in 1851. From then until the Civil War he painted in New York City. Marriage and family Colyer married Mary Lydia Hancock, a grandniece of Massachusetts Governor John Hancock. Civil War During the war, Colyer founded and served with the United States Christian Commission. As superintendent of the poor in New Bern, North Carolina under General Ambrose Burnside, he wrote the Report of the Services Rendered by the Freed People to the United States Army in North Carolina, in the Spring of 1862, After the Battle of Newbern (1864). With the government decision in 1863 to allow black troops to fight, Colyer began to recruit and train the men for the United States Colored Troops. He also served with the Indian commission. Traveling the West and Alaska  Colyer traveled the American West in 1868-1871. \\"He represented Friends of the Indians, a Quaker organization that was concerned with the humanitarian treatment of the native inhabitants in government custody. While he did not paint Indian portraits, his sketches reveal some of the earliest forts in Indian Territory and in the Southwest.\\" Colyer advocated the establishment of reservations for the Apache, Yavapai, and neighboring tribes in New Mexico and Arizona to improve their living conditions. This effort earned him the strong opposition of white mining, cattle and agricultural interests. His mission ended in failure. His humanitarian work continued in 1869, when he surveyed conditions among natives of the just-acquired Alaska Territory on behalf of the newly created Board of Indian Commissioners (an advisory group of philanthropists and humanitarians who studied Indian conditions and made recommendations to the commissioner of Indian affairs). Haycox, Stephen W., \\"Races of a Questionable Ethnical Type: Origins of the Jurisdiction of the U.S. Bureau of Education in Alaska, 1867-1885\\"], Pacific Northwest Quarterly, Vol. 75 (October 1984), pages 156-163, accessed August 10, 2006 \\"His 1869 report is important because of its thoroughness, its presumptions, and, most particularly, its influence for more than a decade on officials concerned with the government's response to Alaska natives.\\" Colyer recommended the Federal government fund Indian schools in Alaska as well as provide medical care, a proposal endorsed by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs but rejected by Congress. Instead, partly due to Colyer's efforts,Vincent Colyer, Douglas Frazer Fine Art, accessed August 10, 2006 Congress approved money for education, to be spent through the Interior Department's Bureau of Education. This reduced the influence of the government's Indian agencies, which tended to establish more paternalistic relationships with Indians. In contrast, \\"the Bureau of Education encouraged independence and self-reliance,\\" and tended to have more respect for native cultures. Colyer, a Quaker, was an ardent Christian assimilationist.  Annexation Of British Columbia to U.S.A. Petitions circulated in favour of American annexation. The first, in 1867, was addressed to Queen Victoria, demanding that the British government assume the colony's debts and establish a steamer link, or allow the colony to join the U.S. In 1869, a second petition was addressed to President Ulysses S. Grant, asking him to negotiate American annexation of the territory from Britain. It was delivered to Grant by Vincent Colyer, Indian Commissioner for Alaska, on December 29, 1869. Both petitions were signed by only a small fraction of the colony's population, and British Columbia was ultimately admitted as a Canadian province in 1871. In Alaska in 1869, he made numerous watercolor sketches, many incorporating weather phenomena. That year he is thought to have sketched 15 views of Oregon and the Washington Territory. When Colyer returned east and established his studio in Connecticut, he produced a small number of oil paintings of Western scenes in 1872-1875. They were prominently exhibited at the time, including at the Centennial Exposition of 1876. Later life In Pursuit of Chief Joseph, by Vincent Colyer. The artist here idealizes infantry power, order, and confidence in the vicinity of Fort Lapwai. Colyer was touring northwest Indian reservations that summer.(Harper's Weekly, August 18, 1877, Library of Congress photograph) In the 1860s, Colyer took a yachting trip up the Connecticut shore as far as New Haven, looking for a good spot to relocate his home and studio. He liked what he saw at one island and bought there. Colyer later renamed the isle \\"Contentment Island\\", still its name.Case, Henry J. and Cooper, Simon W.

He moved to Darien, Connecticut in the early 1870s and set up a studio named after his close friend John Kensett. On October 31, 1872, Colyer's wife, Mary Lydia drowned in Long Island Sound after her horse bolted as she was crossing the bridge by buggy to Contentment Island.

Another hanging bowl from Sutton Hoo Bowl found in Bedfordshire. Hanging bowls are a distinctive type of artifact of the period between the end of Roman rule in Britain in c. 410 AD and the emergence of the Christian Anglo-Saxon kingdoms during the 7th century. The surviving examples have mostly been found in Anglo-Saxon graves, but there is general agreement that they reflect Celtic traditions of decoration. The bowls are usually of thin beaten bronze, between 15‚Äì30 cm (6-12 inches) in diameter, and dished or cauldron-shaped in profile. Typically they have three decorative plates ('escutcheons') applied externally just below the rim to support hooks with rings, by which they were suspended. The ornament of these plates is often very sophisticated, and in many cases includes beautiful coloured enamel work, commonly in champlev√© and using spiral motifs. Although their designs and manufacture are thought to proceed from Celtic technique, they are principally found in eastern Britain, and especially in the areas which received Anglo-Saxon acculturation. Their production is also evidenced in Pictish and Irish contexts, but they seem almost completely absent from Wales, Devon and Cornwall. Rupert Bruce- Mitford's corpus gives the following breakdown of the locations in modern terms of the 174 finds he includes (many are just one or more elements of a bowl):Table 2, p. 64 :England 117, Scotland 7, Ireland 17 :Norway 26, Sweden 2, Denmark 1, :Germany 2, Belgium 1, Netherlands 1  Function  The bowls are enigmatic because their intended function is not certainly known. Many have finely-worked escutcheons set centrally within, which makes it unlikely that they could have contained opaque or sticky material such as lamp-fat. The theory that they were used as maritime compasses, with a magnetic pin floated on water within the bowl, is discounted because many have an iron band around the rim which would render this unworkable. Another opinion is that they were used for the Roman custom of mixing wine and water for service at table. Some bowls are too small to make this explanation workable if general potation were intended. However, in ritual Christian or other meals it would be possible for a group to dip bread into such a wine-bowl in imitation of the Last Supper. Evangelist portrait of Saint John from the 8th century Anglo-Saxon Stockholm Codex Aureus; the roundels above the columns appear to copy hanging bowl escutcheons. Part of the puzzle lies in whether the bowls were normally suspended by threads from a central fulcrum (like a lamp), or from hooks on a tripod with tall wooden legs. There is some support for the latter view, because the nearest formal parallel for such bowls from Antique contexts is in depictions of the Oracular Cortina, a three-hooked bowl suspended within a tripod, over which the priestess sat when pronouncing oracles. Certainly if water were contained in the bowls it is more likely to have been for ritual or liturgical purposes than for general consumption owing to the limited capacity. This would therefore be 'special' water, perhaps consecrated for baptism or aspersion, or (in other religious circumstances) derived from a sacred source or spring. 'Tripods' are also mentioned as prizes for warriors in early literature, including the early Welsh.  Motifs  Some bowls have clearly Christian motifs on their escutcheons. The spiral ornament developed through the 6th to 7th century invention of the 'trumpet-spiral' pattern, which was afterwards adopted from these enamels and incorporated into the repertoire of the famous painted Gospel-books such as the Book of Durrow or the Lindisfarne Gospels. This painted decoration was certainly intended for meditative contemplation and as a devotional work. From the very mixed cultures and beliefs of the inhabitants of Britain during the Dark Ages, the art, and perhaps some part of the function of these bowls became absorbed into the Celto-Saxon ornamental language of Christian Britain. Among the finest examples is the large bowl from the Sutton Hoo ship-burial (near Woodbridge, Suffolk), which has an enameled fish sculpture set to swivel on a pin within the bowl.British Museum Hanging bowl from the ship-burial at Sutton Hoo. Influence on church plate The distinctive shape of the two most famous early Irish chalices, the Ardagh Chalice and the Derrynaflan Chalice has been described as an adaptation of the hanging bowl form for a different use,Ryan, Patrick. in Youngs, 131 although others see them as using shapes derived from Byzantine metalwork.

In this battle the Russian corps under the command of Peter Wittgenstein stood up to the French corps under the command of Marshal Nicolas Oudinot. The result was a minor Russian victory, their forces managing to capture the disputed village of Klyastitsy, although both sides suffered heavy losses on the process. The French partially retreated along their communication lines after the battle, and fended off Russian pursuers.  The battle  On 29 July 12 French cavalry squadrons were surprised and attacked by eight Russian hussard and Cossack squadrons under Gen. Yakov Kulnev. At that time Oudinot occupied the village of Klyastitsy on his advance towards St. Petersburg. There were 28,000 French troops, while the Russian Corps numbered 17,000. In spite of being outnumbered, Wittgenstein decided to fight. The battle started on 30 July at 2:00 pm. The Russian vanguard led by Kulnev (approximately 4,000 men) fought the French vanguard for the whole day near the village of Yakubov (–Ø–∫—É–±–æ–≤–æ). Kulnev managed to press the French but they kept the village under their control. The next day, after several attacks and counterattacks, the Russian advance forced Oudinot to retreat to Klyastitsy. In order to continue their advance, the Russian troops had to cross the River Nishcha. Oudinot ordered his troops to set fire to the only bridge. While the Russian cavalry was wading across the Nishcha, the 2nd Battalion of the Pavlovsk Grenadier Regiment rushed the burning bridge. This was depicted by Peter Hess in his painting, illustrated to the right. Kulnev continued to chase the French Corps with several cavalry regiments and one infantry battalion. After crossing the Drissa River on 1 August, his unit ran into an ambush and suffered heavy casualties from French artillery. Kulnev was badly wounded (he had both his legs severed by a cannonball) and died that same day. Oudinot retreated to Polotsk and the French advance on St. Petersburg failed.  Aftermath  Wittgenstein was awarded the Order of St. George of the Second Degree. Alexander I is reported to have called him \\"the savior of St. Petersburg\\". Capt. Krylov, whose unit was the first to cross the river over the burning bridge, received the Order of St. George of the Fourth Degree.

On July 24, 2007, Kennedy was promoted to the AAA Scranton/Wilkes Barre Yankees. He posted a 1‚Äì1 record there with a 2.08 ERA in six starts, striking out 34 and walking just 11 in 34.2 innings. New York Yankees New York Yankees in 2008 Kennedy made his major league debut with the New York Yankees on September 1, 2007 in place of Mike Mussina, to whom he has been compared. He earned the win, allowing three runs (only one earned run) in seven innings, striking out six, walking two, and allowing five hits. Kennedy said before his first game: On November 28, 2007 Kennedy was named the 26th best prospect by Minor League Baseball's official website. Despite having been replaced by Kennedy in the rotation in 2007, Mussina became a mentor for Kennedy and other young pitchers on the Yankee roster even requesting that Kennedy and Phil Hughes receive lockers next to his during 2008 spring training. On May 4, 2008 Kennedy was demoted to AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre after a poor start to the 2008 season. Ian dominated in his first start back with AAA Scranton/Wilkes Barre, tossing 7.1 innings of 1-hit ball while striking out eight. On May 28, 2008, after enduring a strained right lat muscle, and being diagnosed with bursitis behind the scapular, Kennedy was placed on the DL, expected to miss at least 15 days. He returned to the AAA affiliate of the New York Yankees, struggling in his first few starts before going on a three-game tear. From July 19 to 29, Kennedy pitched 20 innings, allowing 7 hits which yielded 3 runs, while collecting 14 Ks, and walking only 4. On July 24, Kennedy had another no-hitter broken up, after pitching a dominant 6 innings. Kennedy made his return to the major leagues on August 8, starting in place of an injured Joba Chamberlain. After a poor outing against the Angels, in which he surrendered 5 runs in 2 innings, Kennedy was optioned in favour of Billy Traber on August 10. Kennedy was diagnosed with an aneurysm under his right armpit and underwent surgery May 12, 2009, at Roosevelt Hospital in New York under the care of Dr. George Todd, the same doctor who performed David Cone's procedure on an aneurysm in 1996. On September 19, Ian Kennedy was called up from the minors. On September 23, Kennedy made an appearance against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He hit one batter and walked two others, but allowed no hits while pitching a scoreless 8th inning. Kennedy was not on the post-season roster for the Yankees during their run towards winning the 2009 World Series. Arizona Diamondbacks Arizona Diamondbacks in 2013 In December 2009, Ian Kennedy went to the Diamondbacks in a three-way trade with the Detroit Tigers and the Yankees, in which Detroit received Austin Jackson and Phil Coke from the Yankees and Max Scherzer and Daniel Schlereth from the Diamondbacks, the Yankees received Curtis Granderson from the Tigers, and the Diamondbacks also received Edwin Jackson from the Tigers. In Kennedy's first appearance for Arizona, he pitched two scoreless innings in a rain-shortened game. He got his first win as a Diamondback on April 29, going 8 innings, while allowing 6 hits which led to 4 runs and striking out 6. On August 26, Kennedy struck out a career-high 12 batters, while allowing only 1 hit and 2 walks in 7 innings against the San Diego Padres. Despite posting an ERA of 3.80 (including a 3.34 ERA in the second half of the season) across 32 starts and striking out 168 in 194 innings, his record stood at 9-10 due to a weak bullpen as the Diamondbacks finished the season 32 games under .500 and last in the NL West. Kennedy was named the Diamondbacks' 2011 Opening Day starting pitcher. On April 25, Kennedy threw the first complete game of his career, a three-hit shutout at Chase Field, outdueling 2008 AL Cy Young winner Cliff Lee. He struck out ten strikeout and gave up no walks in a 4‚Äì0 win over the Philadelphia Phillies. Kennedy continued to pitch very well through the first half of the season, matching his win total from the previous year by his final start before the All-Star break. At that time, he was 9‚Äì3 in 19 starts with a 3.44 ERA in innings. After a strong first half, Kennedy performed magnificently following the All Star break, with the Diamondbacks winning in all but one of his remaining starts. This included a streak of winning a career-high seven consecutive starts (starting from July 8) where he posted a 2.44 ERA in 48 innings. A three-inning start in a loss to the Phillies on August 18 snapped this streak. Kennedy then proceeded to win six of his last seven starts, posting a 1.66 ERA and allowing just one home run during that span. On September 19, Kennedy earned his 20th win of the season after striking out a career-high 12 batters over eight shutout innings in a 1‚Äì0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates, becoming the first 20-game winner in the National League that year, and just the fourth Diamondbacks pitcher with a 20+ win season. Kennedy finished the second half of the season with 12 wins (tied with that year's Cy Young winners Clayton Kershaw and Justin Verlander for the most in the majors following the All Star break) against just one loss, while posting a 2.11 ERA in 14 starts (the third-best mark in the majors). The Diamondbacks ended up coming back from their last place finish in 2010 by clinching the NL West division title on September 23 with a 3‚Äì1 victory over the Giants, their first division title (and first postseason appearance) since 2007. They finished the season with a 94-68 record (their best since 2002). Facing off against the Milwaukee Brewers in the 2011 NLDS, Kennedy was tabbed to start Game 1 against Milwaukee's ace Yovani Gallardo at Miller Park. He took the loss after giving up four earned runs over innings. Kennedy would face off against Gallardo once again in Game 5. This time, he gave up just two earned runs in six innings of work, but received a no-decision as the Brewers won 3-2 after Nyjer Morgan's walk-off single in the 10th inning, eliminating the Diamondbacks from the postseason. Kennedy finished the 2011 season with a stellar 21‚Äì4 record and a 2.88 ERA over 33 starts. His .840 win-loss percentage for the season led the major leagues and remains the best ever single-season win-loss percentage from a Diamondbacks starting pitcher, while his 21 wins were tied with Kershaw for the most in the National League that year. Kennedy ranked among the league leaders in all other major pitching categories as well. He was seventh in the NL in ERA (2.88), fifth in innings pitched (222), fourth in games started (33), twentieth in complete games (1), sixth in shutouts (1), eighth in strikeouts (198), fifth in opponent batting average (.227), sixth in WHIP (1.09), sixth in hit batters (9), fifth in H/9 (7.54), fifteenth in K/9 (8.03), fourteenth in BB/9 (2.23), seventh in K/BB (3.60), thirteenth in FIP (3.22), ninth in batters faced (900), fifth in quality starts (24), ninth in number of pitches thrown (3,424), fifth in adjusted ERA+ (137), fifth in bWAR (4.8) and eighth in fWAR (4.4). Kennedy received the Diamondbacks Pitcher of the Year Award as well as the Breakout Everyday Player of the Year MLB.com Award. He placed fourth in the balloting for the NL Cy Young Award behind Kershaw, Roy Halladay, and Cliff Lee and 14th for the NL MVP Award. Kennedy was selected to be the Opening Day starter for the second year in a row in 2012, earning his first ever Opening Day win after throwing innings of three-run ball against the Giants. The season as a whole was not as stellar as he was in 2011. He finished with a strong record of 15‚Äì12 and 187 strikeouts in innings across 33 starts, but with a 4.02 ERA. The 216 hits he gave up were the second most in the National League and batters hit .266 against him, while he gave up nearly 50% more home runs (28) than the previous year (19) in fewer innings (0.77 HR/9 in 2011 vs. 1.21 HR/9 in 2012) and posted a much higher WHIP of 1.30. Though Kennedy still pitched solidly as a whole, turning in 20 quality starts in 33 outings, his ERA was affected by his differences in pitching winning vs. non-winning games. In the 15 starts he received the win, Kennedy posted a 1.94 ERA in 102 innings, struck out 8.65 batters per nine innings, gave up just seven home runs (0.62 HR/9), and posted quality starts in all but one outing. Meanwhile, in his 18 non-winning starts, Kennedy's ERA ballooned to 6.01 in innings, his strikeouts per nine innings dropped to 7.53, he gave up 21 home runs (1.78 HR/9) and delivered only six quality outings. Kennedy was tabbed for a third consecutive Opening Day start in 2013, earning the win after a seven inning, two-run outing against the Cardinals. On June 11, 2013, Kennedy was ejected from a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers after hitting both Yasiel Puig in the nose and Zack Greinke in the shoulder with pitches, the second of which ignited a bench-clearing brawl. He was suspended 10 games by MLB for the incident, the first pitcher to get that type of suspension in eight years. He began the 2013 season 3-8 with a 5.23 ERA in 21 starts with the Diamondbacks. San Diego Padres San Diego Padres in 2015 On July 31, 2013, Kennedy was traded to the San Diego Padres for Joe Thatcher, Matt Stites, and a compensatory draft pick.The Kansas City Royals have made a move to bolster their starting rotation, reportedly signing Ian Kennedy to a five-year, $70 million contract. Kennedy was immediately added to the Padres rotation. He started 10 games for the Padres, going 4-2 with a 4.24 ERA and 55 strike-outs in 57 innings. In the 2014 season, Kennedy reached 200 strikeouts for the first time in his career, becoming the fourth Padres pitcher to reach that mark and first since Jake Peavy did it in 2007. He finished 13-13 with an ERA of 3.63. The following season, in 2015, he lost a career-high 15 games, finishing with just 9 wins. For the 2015 season he led the majors in giving up the most home runs per nine innings (1.66), and in giving up the highest percentage of hard-hit balls (35.2%).Major League Leaderboards ¬ª 2015 ¬ª Pitchers ¬ª Dashboard  FanGraphs BaseballMajor League Leaderboards ¬ª 2015 ¬ª Pitchers ¬ª Batted Ball Statistics  FanGraphs Baseball Kansas City Royals On January 29, 2016, Kennedy signed a 5-year, $70 million contract with the Kansas City Royals.

Ungava Peninsula The Ungava Peninsula, situated on the northeast portion of the Canadian Shield, is where the Rae Province connects with the Superior Province. The area is composed of Archean rocks (ca. 2.7-2.9 Ga) from the Douglas Harbour Domain (see Superior craton). The Rae Craton Archean rocks are overlain by Paleoproterozoic supracrustal sequences (ca. 1.8-2.1 Ga) and intruded by Paleoproterozoic diabase dykes (ca.2.0-2.2 Ga). The supracrustal rocks comprise nappes that form part of the Ungava and Labrador troughs. In the zone east of the Labrador Trough axis, the Paleoproterozoic deformation reworked the Archean rocks of the Douglas Harbour Domain, as well as the Paleoproterozoic diabase dykes. The metamorphic conditions which parallel the deformation increase from west to east and from middle amphibolite to granulite facies. U-Pb isotope analyses of zircon yield secondary ages around 1790 Ma. These results are interpreted as the age of metamorphism and indicate a reactivation of the northeastern margin of the Superior Province during a Paleoproterozoic tectono-metamorphic event, resulting from probable continental collision.

Space War Blues is a science fiction novel by American writer Richard A. Lupoff. It is a fixup of several previously published pieces, the longest of which, \\"With The Bentfin Boomer Boys On Little Old New Alabama\\" (hereinafter ‚ÄúWTBBB‚Äù), first appeared in Harlan Ellison's 1972 anthology Again, Dangerous Visions. In his introduction to the novella, Ellison wrote: \\"It is so audacious and extravagant a story that it becomes one of the three or four really indispensable reasons for doing this book. Frankly, had no other story than this one been written for A,DV ‚Äî the book would be worth reading.\\"Ellison, Harlan. ‚ÄúIntroduction to WTBBB‚Äù, Again, Dangerous Visions, Doubleday, 1972: 671. The story appeared on the final Nebula Award ballot for Best Novella of the Year. History Lupoff wrote the book over a period of almost eleven years. He began writing ‚ÄúWTBBB‚Äù in 1967, submitting the first three chapters of the 36,000-word novella to Harlan Ellison. With Ellison's encouragement, Lupoff expanded it to the 38,000-word version he turned in to Ellison in February 1969. Henry Morrison, Lupoff's agent, submitted this version to Dell, which became interested in publishing ‚ÄúWTBBB‚Äù as a possible stand-alone ‚Äúslim‚Äù novel. Lupoff's contract with Ellison prohibited any prior appearance of stories slated for Again, Dangerous Visions, and along with the delay in ADV's publication, the deal with Dell fell through. In 1973, Lupoff wrote a pair of stories which, while directly related to each other, were tangential to the main storyline of \\"WTBBB\\". These stories, \\"After the Dreamtime\\" and \\"Sail the Tide of Mourning\\", were published in the fourth and fifth volumes of Robert Silverberg‚Äôs original anthology series New Dimensions. Both stories were on the final Hugo Award ballot of their respective years, and \\"Sail the Tide of Mourning\\" was on the 1975 Nebula Awards ballot. Another story, \\"The Bentfin Boomer Girl Comes Thru\\", closer in style to \\"WTBBB\\", was published by editor Ted White in Amazing Stories magazine. These pieces are intertwined throughout the novel (see Contents below for a chapter-by-chapter breakdown.) After a succession of editors at Dell, a 70,000-word version of the novel was finally published in paperback in June 1978, with a hardcover reprint two years later by Gregg Press, aimed primarily at libraries. According to the author's preface in the first edition, Lupoff was open to changes in the book's content and title (first New Alabama Blues, then New Alabama Spacewar Blues, and finally Space War Blues, when the cover designer complained that the title was too long.) A manuscript reader for Dell described the book as \\"unutterable bilge\\" and claimed the only intelligible part was a little prefatory note by an imaginary \\"Uncle Dudley.\\" When Jim Frenkel, the last of the four Dell editors who worked with the novel, asked Lupoff to remove the \\"Uncle Dudley\\" sections, he readily agreed.Lupoff, Richard A. \\"And I Awoke ‚Äî Was This Some Kind of Joke?\\", Space War Blues, Dell, June 1978: 27-33. Frenkel wrote about the novel's style in his introduction to the hardcover reprint: \\"there are no fixed rules of grammar, spelling, or punctuation in the book, save for the unwritten rule that the inconsistency in all of the above is recognizably different and consistent within each narrative thread‚ÄùFrenkel, James R.. ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù Space War Blues, Gregg Press, May 1980: v. The thread with the greatest divergence from standard English is the ‚ÄúWTBBB‚Äù sections. For example: > ‚Äônifykin look outha portole sreely pretty, sreely pretty, lookna Port Upotoi > swinging roun thole mudball, thole goodole place, it‚Äôs maybe not the > prettiest place na whole universe but nobody ever said it was, it was home > though m that counted frole lot that swat Leander Laptip saw outha > portole:Lupoff, Richard A. Space War Blues, Dell, June 1978: 220. These divergences are apparently an attempt to represent (orthographically) vernacular English of the southern states of the USA.

Inspired by the life of Anne Frank, it follows the story of a teenage girl named Nicole Burns. The story was adapted as a play in 1996 in New York City, written and directed by Cherie Bennett. Plot summary Nicole, a fifteen-year-old American high school student living in the year 2001, comes from an affluent household and takes her lifestyle for granted. She has a website she calls Notes of GirlX. On the website, she talks about her life and frustrations. Absorbed in her studies, she becomes fascinated with a Holocaust survivor who speaks to her English class, named Paulette Littzer-Gold. Nicole feels drawn to the woman, and asks if they have previously met. The class takes a trip to a local Holocaust museum. During the trip, Nicole and her peers are assigned roles as Jewish teens living during the Holocaust. After the activity begins, Nicole hears students shrieking and gunfire. She attempts to run along with the rest of her classmates, but is struck in the back while ascending a staircase and loses consciousness. When Nicole wakes, she finds herself in Paris in 1942. She is told that she is Nicole Bernhardt, the name of the fictional Jewish girl assigned her by her English teacher back in the Holocaust museum. As months passed, Nicole tells herself that the 2001 world is a dream and accepts that she is Nicole Bernhardt. Several of Nicole's friends are non-Jews who oppose Hitler's policies and protect the Bernhardt family. However, following the German invasion of France, Nicole's situation gets dramatically worse. Eventually, she is forced to hide in a rundown apartment in the streets of Paris. From her refuge, Nicole writes a string of anti-Nazi letters for the French resistance. In the letters, she calls herself GirlX. The Bernhardt family is betrayed and Nicole is transported to Auschwitz and she meets Anne Frank aboard the train. Nicole remembers that she read Anne's diary and tells her, but Anne says she left it where she had been hiding. Later, a fellow Jew tries to save Nicole by sending her to be slave labor in the camp instead of being sent to be killed. Nicole and her sister Liz-Bette, who is very ill, are to be split up, Nicole to live and Liz-Bette to die. Nicole becomes hysterical and begs to be allowed to accompany her sister. The Germans, after mocking Nicole's devotion to Liz- Bette, allow her to go with the young girl. Nicole tearfully thanks them and then walks with Liz-Bette to the \\"showers.\\" Liz-Bette is frenzied with terror, but Nicole calms her. Nicole then leads her sister in a Jewish prayer, as she whispers she loves Liz-Bette and they succumb to death. Nicole wakes up, lying on a bench outside the museum. She finds out that other students had set off firecrackers which sent everyone running, when she bumped her head. Nicole stays at the hospital for a few days, and afterwards her life goes on, but she can't figure out if she was really in the Holocaust, or if it was just a bad dream. Nicole believes Paulette Littzer-Gold, the Holocaust survivor, who visited her school was the same woman at the Concentration Camp who told her to \\"stay to the right.\\" The next day, Nicole finds out Mrs. Littzer-Gold had died overnight. She decides to go to Mrs. Littzer-Gold's funeral. Nicole sees a picture of her, but she looks nothing like the woman she thought she was. Nicole sadly accepts that she was never Nicole Bernhardt and that she never lived during the Holocaust. After the funeral, Nicole looks at the things that belonged to Mrs. Littzer-Gold that are at the altar. She notices that a letter Mrs. Littzer-Gold owned was one of the GirlX letters that Nicole herself had written, back in Paris in 1942. The letter talked about how no one could silence her ( \\"her\\" being GirlX). Not only did Nicole find out she really had lived in the Holocaust, but she gave Mrs. Littzer-Gold the courage to live. Nicole takes her sister to a museum about Anne Frank.

Genre: Holocaust. 2001, G. P. Putnam's Sons, 291 pp. Ages 12 up. Reviewer: Kay Park Haas; Ottawa, KansasReviews at Barnes and Noble *Based on the authors' off-Broadway play of the same title, this is a powerful and affecting story. Narrated by Nicole, it makes the deprivations and degradation of the Nazi occupation come alive. Even if Nicole's trip back in time stretches belief, her emotions are always credible, from her changing feelings toward her family to her romance with her Paris boyfriend (the boy who ignored her in America), her boredom and terror while in hiding, and her bravery as she and her sister are being transported toward a concentration camp. This gripping story is an excellent companion to The Diary of Anne Frank and to studies of the Holocaust.

Reviewer: Paula Rohrlick; May 2001 (Vol. 35 No. 3) *Based on Bennett and Gottesman's 1997 play of the same name, this novel modernizes Nicole's story with the addition of the Internet, and the characters of Mrs. Litzger-Gold and Doom help to emphasize the importance of witnessing, remembering, and seeking truth. Shallow and apathetic, Nicole Burns reaches across time in this complex coming-of-age, time-travel novel that manages the many allusion-based plot threads well. As Nicole Bernhardt shares a cattle car with Anne Frank, she identifies with the girl and the story that Nicole Burns dismissed. Nicole Burns returns to her world with a better understanding of how honoring the truth about the past will help to safeguard the future. Young adults who have read Anne Frank's diary ... might be motivated to read more about the Holocaust.

In the beginning of the play, Nicole is practicing a dance with her friends that they will perform at the school dance that weekend. Her friend Suzanne asks her about the assignment they are reading for English class, which is The Diary of Anne Frank. Nicole's father is a scientist and doesn't believe in anything he cannot prove using his science, so Nicole is not even sure if the Holocaust existed. Later, at the dance, Jack asks Nicole to dance. However, he only does this to inform her that he has a crush on Suzanne. Nicole freaks out and runs into the street, getting hit by a car. When she wakes up she is in 1942, Paris and her family is Jewish. After getting over the original confusion, Nicole enjoys her Paris life, even though it is a restricted one. Eventually her family goes into hiding, but they are found out as being Jewish. On the train to Auschwitz, Nicole meets Anne Frank. They talk for a while, Nicole saying that she has read Anne's diary. When they get to Auschwitz, Nicole, her younger sister, mother, and Anne are all sent into the gas chambers. They pray a traditional Jewish prayer while the gas comes on. In the next scene, Nicole has woken up and is in a hospital bed. She seems to be thoroughly confused by her experience, questioning which life is or was reality. She is also now convinced that the Holocaust was real and should be remembered forever.

They are also referred to as \\"lyrics\\" (a genre term) by Tamils in English. These are mostly a collection of indigenous hymns written by Protestant Tamil Christian poets. A few of them are translations of Christian hymns from other languages. They use the kƒ´rtta·πâai form that includes the classical karnatak raga (mode) and tala (rhythmic cycle) designations for each song. Some of these ragas and talas are followed in Church practice, while from the 1940s, other kƒ´rtta·πâai were adapted to simpler Western style tunes in major scale that more easily facilitated the accompaniment of organ.Sherinian, Zoe. ‚ÄúMusical Style and the Changing Social Identity of Tamil Christians.‚Äù Ethnomusicology, vol. 51, no. 2, Spring/Summer 2007: 238-280. These hymns were written in the early stages of Protestant Christianity in India by composers such as Vedanayakam Sastriar who worked under the German Lutheran missionaries in the Tanjore area (likely the 1780s on). They were first published for broad use among the Protestant denominations and mission societies in 1853 by the American Congregational (ABCFM) missionary Edward Webb, in the hymn book titled Christian Lyrics for Public and Social Worship. Webb and eight of his catechists spent a couple months learning the songs from Vedanayakam Sastriar and then transmitted them orally throughout the towns and villages of the Protestant missions.Chandler, John S.

During this time, he played for the Indianapolis Colts and San Diego Chargers. Over the course of his career, he played in 43 games, rushed for 689 yards on 241 carries, and ran for 12 touchdowns. High school and college Culver attended St. Martin de Porres High School in Detroit, Michigan and earned a scholarship to the University of Notre Dame where he started as a tailback in 1990 and 1991. The Irish backfield had a number of talented running backs including future pros Ricky Watters and Reggie Brooks, and NFL Hall-of-Famer Jerome Bettis. Culver played as a freshman on the 1988 national championship team, including a touchdown run in the 1989 Fiesta Bowl against West Virginia. He led the Irish in rushing in 1990 with 710 yards in 11 games. The Irish were ranked number one twice that year and eventually lost to the University of Colorado in the 1991 Orange Bowl. The following year, Culver was injured but played spectacularly in Notre Dame's 39-28 defeat of the University of Florida Gators. The performance propelled him to a professional career. In 1990, he became the first single captain in 20 years. He graduated with a degree in finance in three-and-a-half years. Professional football career Culver was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in the fourth round of the 1992 NFL Draft. He was a short-yardage back his first year, carrying the ball 121 times for 321 yards and seven touchdowns. He also caught 26 passes for 210 yards and two more touchdowns. The Colts finished 9‚Äì7 but missed the AFC playoffs by one game. In 1993, the Colts were expected to contend but a holdout by Jeff George and an injury to Steve Emtman plunged the Colts to last. Culver ran for three touchdowns and caught one more. He was cut at the end of the season and claimed off waivers by the San Diego Chargers just before the start of the 1994 season. Culver was the last man in a talented San Diego backfield that included newcomer Natrone Means, and halfbacks Eric Bieniemy and Ronnie Harmon. Culver, in fact, only carried the ball eight times all year, but he averaged over seven yards per carry. In the 1994‚Äì95 divisional playoff versus Miami, Culver carried six times for fourteen yards as the Chargers beat the Miami Dolphins, 22‚Äì21. Culver had no carries or catches in the 1994‚Äì95 AFC Championship Game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, a game won by the Chargers, 17‚Äì13. Culver made an appearance in Super Bowl XXIX against the San Francisco 49ers, but he failed to touch the ball. The Chargers lost, 49‚Äì26. In his final season, 1995, Culver got more carries because of a holdout and later injury to Natrone Means. He carried the ball forty-seven times for 155 yards and three touchdowns and caught five passes for twenty-one yards. The Chargers made it back to the playoffs but lost to Culver's former team, the Colts, 35‚Äì20. Culver scored the tying touchdown in the infamous Chargers-Giants \\"Snowball Game\\" at the Meadowlands in 1995. It was his last-ever TD. Death Culver and his wife Karen were killed in the crash of ValuJet Flight 592 on May 11, 1996. The Culvers are survived by their two daughters, at the time of the crash ages 2 (Briana) and 14 months (Jada). A settlement was reached with the airline ValuJet, which paid Culver's family $28 million. Culver was the second member of the 1994 Chargers team to die in the years following the team's appearance in Super Bowl XXIX. Culver's death occurred eleven and a half months after the death of teammate David Griggs.

It consists of Australia Felix (1917), The Way Home (1925), and Ultima Thule (1929). It was collected in 1930 under the title by which it is now best known. Its publisher, William Heinemann Ltd, claimed on the jacket to the 1965 edition, \\"This is now recognized as one of the greatest novels in the English language.\\" It was acclaimed for its rich characterizations and then- startling depiction of mental illness attacking an otherwise respectable person, while his much-younger wife, who does not think herself clever, must become resourceful with a high-level of uncomfortable capability. In recent years, it has been recognised as a graphic description of the onset and evolution of young onset dementia caused by neurosyphilis, the condition from which her father died. The book is based, at least in outline, on events in the life of Richardson's parents, Walter Lindesay Richardson and Mary Bailey, though it should not be considered a biography, as many major and minor changes were made. The publisher originally balked at publishing the third volume (after the first two had modest sales) without persuasion from Richardson's husband. Only when the third volume appeared was it hailed as a great novel. Ultima Thule won the Australian Literature Society Gold Medal for 1929. An early American edition of the book contained an introduction by Sinclair Lewis in which he erroneously claimed that Richardson's true name was Henrietta, with no mention of Ethel. A new 3-volume edition was released by Australian Scholarly Publishing in December 2007. A new one-volume edition, with a new introduction by Peter Craven, was issued in Australia by Text Publishing in its Text Classics series in 2012. Australia Felix Australia Felix was originally published as The Fortunes of Richard Mahony: Australia Felix, with the subtitle appearing only on the title page. \\"Australia Felix\\" is a description used by explorer Major Thomas Mitchell in 1836 for the lush plains he discovered between the Murray River and the south coast of Victoria, including the area that later became the site of Ballarat. Part One Nine chapters and a prologue introducing us to Dr. Richard Townshend-Mahony, F.R.C.S., M.D., Edinburgh, for two years the proprietor of Diggers' Emporium in Ballarat township, near Melbourne, which he runs with his assistants Long Jim and Ebenezer Hempel. He came to the goldfields in 1852 based on advertising that made gold seem easy to acquire. He was accompanied by his best friend, Purdy Smith, an Englishman with whom he has little in common, but is more refined than typical diggers like old lawyer Ocock and his son, Tom, and later, his older son, Henry. The fact that Mahony refuses to partake of alcohol on even a social level often causes others to dislike him. A large portion of the first part deals with Mahony's courtship of fifteen-year-old Polly Turnham, who works as a servant at the Beamish Hotel, and with his sleeping with the two plump Beamish sisters, Tilly and Jinny. The sisters are virtually indistinguishable save for their eye color, and they insist on mispronouncing Richard's surname \\"Ma-hon-y\\", though the accent is supposed to be on the first syllable. After working with her brother, Ned, and facing a battery of questions from her elder brother, John, Richard is able to marry Polly. John and his beautiful wife Emma are unable to attend when the latter falls ill. Also arriving for the wedding is Polly's older sister, Sarah. Part Two Eight chapters. The store unprofitable, Polly is displeased with the dirt floor shack Richard calls home. Richard takes up medicine at Polly's prompting and she helps Richard build a successful practice in Ballarat. John has gone temporarily mad when his wife's illness leads to her death. He was so devoted to her that he needs the children removed from his home while he recovers from his grief. Polly miscarries, and is more than happy to take in the children, Emma (Trotty, later Emmy), Johnny, and Jerry, along with Sarah. Sarah takes on a new name, Sara \\"(spoken Sahra)\\". Mahony & Polly move to a new house. Part Three Eleven chapters. Mahony begins a longstanding habit of shutting himself away reading religion and philosophy, starring with Lamarck and De Maillet, coming from a baseline of Irish Protestantism, and wanting to release God from the \\"dead-letterism from which the centuries had accumulated about Him\\" to reveal a God of mercy. Henry Ocock courts Agnes Glenidinning, whose father is in an asylum for trying to kill her. Sara is so sick of her name being mispronounced that she changes it to Zara for a more French feel. John recovers and takes toward politics with great success, and takes the children back in. Part Four Twelve chapters. Ned takes to wife another Polly, so his sister begins using her real name, Mary, feeling she has outgrown the name Polly. Mahony has become rather successful as a physician, but Henry Ocock has been even more successful, which bothers Richard, who believes his relative refinement should be reflected in his earnings. Mahony does indeed become more and more successful, and Mary becomes deeply involved in the preparations for a gala to raise money for a statue of Burke and Wills. John sends his children to boarding school. The more successful Mahony gets, the more he longs to return to England. Tempted by the gold that was falsely promised, he had been wanting to extricate himself forever from Australia's soil, and he sells the house to pay for the journey, desiring to set up a country practice in a country where the apples grow red on all sides. The Way Home Proem Richard is more sociable than Mary has ever seen him during the sea voyage home, and he does not appear to be as aloof and arrogant as he often was, but treating his fellow passengers sociably, many whose memories of England were dim if any, much like Mary's. Part One Eight chapters. Richard settles on the town of Buddlecombe, near Glasgow. He selects a more pleasant house a little farther, and uphill from the main part of town. Business is slow to develop. There is only one other doctor in town, and he is a drunk. Richard begins to hold the suspicion that the fact that he has practised in Australia is being held against him. Such suspicions are confirmed, when this Doctor Robinson is forced to call upon him for aid, Robinson gets all the credit. And when Mary is mistakenly delivered an invitation to a party at \\"the Hall\\", the finest house in the town, that was intended for a woman living in a shanty down the road, he becomes convinced that he can have no success in England, and decides he must return again to Australia. Part Two Nine chapters. Despite being f√™ted on their return to Ballarat, and its rise to \\"second city of Victoria\\" status, Richard has decided that he is the sort of person that cannot remain settled in one place, and decides that he is going to establish a practice in Melbourne, which is reasonable close enough to allow frequent contact with family and friends. He becomes wealthy through shares/dividends and no longer needs to work. He calls his new home, that he believes will be his last, Ultima Thule. Zara decides to marry Ebenezer Hempel, despite his age, for the sake of being married, as her worldly ways had gotten in the way of her finding a younger husband. Emmy spends more time with the Mahonys and Richard grows close to her. Purdy has now decided to marry Tilly. Agnes Ocock falls while holding her baby and he dies. Mahony's fortunes become so great that he lives on occasional consulting to the hospital and can afford all the books he has ever desired. He cocoons himself away with books he is constantly having special ordered from London. Mary can never respect his wishes not to be disturbed, never getting past the point of view that books are to pass the time, not essential mental exercise as they are to Richard. She is displeased that he becomes unsociable, yet he does go out on occasion. At one party in particular, he meets Lizzie Timms-Kelly, a young contralto. He is so impressed, that he brings John to meet her, who becomes smitten. Much to the distress of Emmy, John and Lizzie are married. Richard becomes much distressed at his wife's seeming illness, but it turns out that, at long last, they are to have a child. Richard, though he had wanted children before, is now less than enthusiastic about the intrusion onto his reading time, but does his best to accommodate the idea, and the child is baptized Cuthbert Hamilton Townshend-Mahony. Part Three Ten chapters. \\"Cuffy\\"'s birth is followed by twin girls known as the Dumplings, later identified as Lallie (Alice) and Lucie. The Dumplings are an inseparable pair. Cuffy is clearly as introverted as his father, which is seen as quite bothersome. He is very modest and hates being changed in front of others. He also gets distraught when his parents leave, despite the presence of nannies and servants. John becomes ill and passes, and Lizzie has full charge of his assets so long as she lives in his home and does not remarry, which causes Emmy's animosity, coupled with Lizzie's attention to her own biological child, to grow. Richard regrets having ever introduced them. Richard considers it important for the children's development for them to see Europe, but in order to do so, he sells the house for some inexplicable reason. He can afford to live off a great investment and eventually return, having disliked England so much on his previous visit, but his new broker, Wilding, absconds with the funds, and the Mahonys must immediately make their way back to Australia. Ultima Thule Ultima Thule was a medieval geographic term to denote a distant place located beyond the \\"borders of the known world\\". Mahony named his house in Melbourne Ultima Thule, but the house was sold in The Way Home and was not returned to in this book, emphasizing how prematurely he had named it. Part One Lake View House at Chiltern, Victoria, the home of Henry Handel Richardson from July 1876 for 1 years. Richardson's early years at Chiltern featured in the novel The Fortunes of Richard Mahony. The house was accepted by the National Trust of Australia in 1967. Ten chapters. Now forty-nine years old, Richard Mahony is broke and has to start his life over again. He salvages 3,000 pounds, but gets into debt unbeknownst to Mary still in Europe, by building a too large new house for the family to return to. His practice in Melbourne doesn't work out and he hears of a good practice at Barambogie. Chapter Five consists of letters to Mary by Richard, staying in Barambogie. He goes to the neighboring towns and eventually establishes that he wants to lease a house near a lagoon there. The house has a hall full of doors that Cuffy particularly likes, though it is near a mill where many foreigners work, and there are some concerns about security, plus the mill whistle screeches every morning at 6am. The town is largely made up of these foreigners, who consider Richard snooty for not socializing with them in taverns. Emmy stays with the Mahonys and Cuffy and the Dumplings insist on having her go over the story of the death of her stepbrother Jacky , who died in infancy, as Cuffy was denied much information when it occurred despite his care and concern. Emmy becomes interested in Reverend Mr. Angus, who shows her a dead donkey in a pit near the lagoon that Cuffy can't wait to see, even though he is not allowed. In this, he loses an expensive new hat, so Mary sends Emmy back to Lizzie, and a governess must be hired. A Baron visits, playing works by Schumann, and offers to be Cuffy's mentor and music teacher, but Mary refuses, despite Richard's insistence that Cuffy has a great ear that she cannot help any longer. Cuffy's memory fades, leaving only his play cry \\"Shooh, woman!\\" developed with the Dumplings. He discovers that eating the kernels of green almonds are a tasty treat, and invites the Dumplings to do so. All of them get very sick, but Cuffy quickly recovers, and Lallie does not come out of it. Even bringing in another doctor fails to help her. The funeral for Alice Mary Townshend-Mahony makes Christmas for the other children a financial hardship. Part Two Ten chapters. Mary in deep grief takes the children on a seaside holiday at Tilly's invitation. Richard is left at home alone. Richard becomes obsessed with the idea that he has seen Lallie's spirit visit him, and that she informed him about her expensive wax doll with a nose melted in a fire. This information is true, but Mary insists that Richard already knew about it and had forgotten. He continues to become more and more interested in spiritualism. His practice virtually ends and he wonders why he had ever left Melbourne. His dislike of black armbands, an apparent obsession of the locals for funerary customs, and his dislike of prayers for the children invoking \\"Gentle Jesus\\" in favor of prayers to a universal God blessing all are seen as rather heathenistic. Mary returns after some concerning letters from Richard who is not coping in her absence. She learns of their debt and sets to work to revive Richard's ailing practice. A visit from the local bishop, even though it doesn't go well creates a boost for business. Hempel having died, Zara is installed as new governess. Richard believes his end is near and advises Cuffy to look after Mary and Lucie after he is gone, but Cuffy seems too young to understand. He is called to help a boy without being told that they suspect a broken leg, and he makes do with the equipment he has brought. At a public gathering, he is asked to speak before the Bishop, who is planning to speak on \\"Our glorious country: Australia\\". This peeves Richard so much that he goes into a diatribe that ultimately ends with reiterating the story about Lallie's doll, and gets himself ridiculed as a drunk. Mary considers blasphemous his claim that his ideas are facing the persecutions of the early Christians. Mr. Nankivell, father of the boy he put in splints, claims that his leg is significantly shorter because he fixed it wrong, and is suing him for malpractice, claiming that he operated while drunk. All Mahony can argue is that he should go to another doctor to have it corrected, as it's not an exact science, he was working under less than optimal conditions, and surgery was never his greatest strength as a physician. Richard experiences surrealistic nightmares in which he watches himself prattle on in court like a drunken fool. He has an odd spell, ranting about things like \\"the Ultimate Plan\\" He attempts to take his own life and Mary takes matters in hand, including their finances and they leave Barambogie \\"like a hunted man\\". Mary wants him to go to Narrong, but Dr. Bowes-Smith advises that he go to Shortlands, which he believes will be better suited for the benefit of his mental health. The entire estate is sold while Richard is away making the arrangements. Part Three Ten chapters. The job at Shortlands requires him to board a ship in the harbor whenever a flag is raised. This involves being rowed out to the ship and climbing a rope ladder to get aboard. On his first venture, he needs to remain and spend several minutes simply resting before he makes the descent. He thinks he is too old to be able to do the job, or soon would be. Richard had previously said that he would not allow Mary to take in boarders as long as he lived, but says that because this is a resort town, it's the normal thing to do, which gives Mary the idea that he is now proclaiming that it was his idea. The town proves to be his idea, and the claim that it is respectable to take in boarders proves false. Dr. Barker, the only doctor in town, despite being semi-retired and not working nights, still gets all the business. Once summer hits in December, they are led to believe that it will grow. Cuffy deals with papa being called \\"cranky\\". Cranky in these times is being crazy. Knowing her husband's eccentricities, she thinks this is a natural product of him getting older. Even Mary has to resort to Dr. Barker when Richard gets into unexplainable fits. Tilly had stowed away 8,000 pounds in secret from her husband, and gave Mary 150 pounds at her request in her time of need. Richard has to be institutionalized‚Äîhis status as a doctor getting a fifty percent discount‚Äîand Mary is advised to go to work as a postmistress, though it involves mingling with a lower class of people. She contacts Henry Ocock, Agnes's husband for advice and he arranges a postmistress job for her. For this she has to move to Gymgurra \\"in the Western District, some two hundred miles from Melbourne; to be reached either by night's sea voyage--round Cape Otway and along the wild coast--or by a combined train and coach journey\\". Mary can no longer afford Richard's accommodation at the private hospital and is persuaded to send Richard to the state mental institution. After settling in her postmistress job, Mary saves up for a trip to Melbourne to pay a surprise visit to the hospital to determine the sort of care Richard is receiving. Along the way, she meets Mrs. Bowman, whose son has been injured in tree-felling and is likely to die. Upon reaching the hospital, she is told that \\"Patient 97 B\\" is kept in solitary confinement on the grounds that he may \\"corrupt\\" the other prisoners. She learns that his personal foibles have not been attended to: he has been throwing his meals back at his keeper because they are served to him on tin plates rather than china. Feeling he can never get well in such conditions, she asks Henry Ocock to arrange for her to remove him from the hospital and takes him to their new home at the post office, hiring Mrs. Bowman as a caregiver. He recognises Mary but does not recognize his children at their age, and wonders where his twin babies are. Cuffy begins to resent having to take him out for walks each night. Finally, he is confronted with the murderous nightmare, an image to long haunting his dreams and memories, such that seeing any body stretched out face down in the road could send him into fits, when he and Lucie are unable to stop a fall from which Richard cannot get up, and gets him laughed at for drunkenness by a passerby. Home in bed, gangrene sets in, and quickly renders the lower half of his body completely useless. Mary sits by the bedside as \\"Bowey\\" takes over the kitchen chores. Richard, finally tells Mary \\"not grieve...for me. I'm going...into Eternity...Dear wife\\". \\"He died at dawn, his faint breaths fluttering to rest.\\". Cuffy feels a mixture of relief, albeit guilty, and upset, then begging for his return, even though his experience with Lallie made clear to him that he wasn't. Richard's small funeral includes Tilly, Jerry, the parson, and the Bank manager. A small cross rose is placed on his grave, but is eventually neglected, toppled by weeds, and removed. \\"And thereafter, his resting-place was indistinguishable from the common ground. The rich and kindly earth of his adopted country absorbed his perishable body, as the country itself had never contrived to make its own his wayward, vagrant spirit.\\" Adaptations MGM announced plans to film the novel in 1946 with Greer Garson and Gregory Peck pencilled in as stars to be produced by Pandro S. Berman, but no movie resulted. For decades, Phillip Adams has wanted to bring Richard Mahony to the screen, and has often spoken about it with director Bruce Beresford. A television miniseries was announced around 1985 and is mentioned on the jacket of Karen McLeod's Henry Handel Richardson: A Critical Study. One of the characters in David Williamson's play, Emerald City (1987), mocks the production's failure to find funding. The same character's summary of the screenplay is \\"Doctor's marriage goes bad, he goes to the goldfields, gets gangrene and dies\\", \\"a real downer\\". in 2002 Currency Press published a theatrical adaptation of the novel, written by Australian playwright Michael Gow.

Fundamentally, it failed in the goal of reducing the cost of space access. Space Shuttle incremental per-pound launch costs ultimately turned out to be considerably higher than those of expendable launchers. By 2011, the incremental cost per flight of the Space Shuttle was estimated at $450 million, or $18,000 per kilogram (approximately $8,000 per pound) to low Earth orbit (LEO). By comparison, the comparable Proton launch vehicle is said to cost as little as $110 million, or around $5,000/kg (approximately $2,300 per pound) to LEO, despite not being reusable. When all design and maintenance costs are taken into account, the final cost of the Space Shuttle program, averaged over all missions and adjusted for inflation, was estimated to come out to $1.5 billion per launch, or $60,000/kg (approximately $27,000 per pound) to LEO.The Rise and Fall of the Space Shuttle, Book Review: Final Countdown: NASA and the End of the Space Shuttle Program by Pat Duggins, American Scientist, 2008, Vol. 96, No. 5, p. 32. This should be contrasted with the originally envisioned costs of $118 per pound of payload in 1972 dollars (approximately $ per pound adjusting for inflation to 2011). It failed in the goal of achieving reliable access to space, partly due to multi-year interruptions in launches following Shuttle failures. NASA budget pressures caused by the chronically high NASA Space Shuttle program costs have eliminated NASA manned space flight beyond low earth orbit since Apollo, and severely curtailed use of unmanned probes. NASA's promotion of and reliance on the Shuttle slowed domestic commercial expendable launch vehicle (ELV) programs until after the 1986 Challenger disaster. Two out of the five spacecraft were destroyed in accidents, killing 14 astronauts, the largest loss of life in space. Purpose of the system \\"Space Transportation System\\" (NASA's formal name for the overall Shuttle program) was created to transport crewmembers and payloads into low Earth orbits. It would afford the opportunity to conduct science experiments on board the shuttle to be used to study the effects of space flight on humans, animals and plants. Other experiments would study how things can be manufactured in space. The shuttle would also enable astronauts to launch satellites from the shuttle and even repair satellites already out in space. The Shuttle was also intended for research into the human response to zero-g. The Shuttle was originally billed as a space vehicle that would be able to launch once a week and give low launch costs through amortization. Development costs were expected to be recouped through frequent access to space. These claims were made in an effort to obtain budgetary funding from the United States Congress. Beginning in 1981, the space shuttle began to be used for space travel. However, by the mid-1980s the concept of flying that many shuttle missions proved unrealistic and scheduled launch expectations were reduced 50%. Following the Challenger accident in 1986, missions were halted pending safety review. This hiatus became lengthy and ultimately lasted almost three years as arguments over funding and the safety of the program continued. Eventually the military resumed the use of expendable launch vehicles instead. Missions were put on hold again after the loss of Columbia in 2003. Overall, 135 missions were launched during the 30 years after the first orbital flight of Columbia, averaging approximately one every 3 months. Costs Some reasons for the higher-than-expected operational costs were: * NASA secured funding from the US Air Force's budget in exchange for USAF input to the design process. In order to fulfill the USAF's mission to launch payloads into polar orbit, the USAF insisted on a very large cross-range requirement. This necessitated the Shuttle's huge delta wings, which are far larger than the stub wings of the original design. Besides adding drag and weight (almost 20 percent), the excessive number of heat tiles needed to protect the delta wings added greatly to maintenance costs, besides increasing operational risks such as resulted in the Columbia disaster. * At Vandenberg Air Force Base the USAF duplicated the entire infrastructure needed to launch and service the Space Shuttle, at a cost of over 4 billion dollars. Following the Challenger explosion, the facility was dismantled after never having launched a single Shuttle mission. * Aerospace engineer Robert Zubrin describes the Shuttle as having been designed \\"backwards\\" in that the Orbiter, the harder-to-recover portion, is made recoverable, while the booster (SRBs and fuel tank) is thrown away even though it is easier to recover since it does not fly so high or fast. * Maintenance of the thermal protection tiles was a very labor-intensive and costly process, with some 35,000 tiles needing to be inspected individually and with each tile specifically manufactured for one specific slot on the shuttle. * The RS-25 engines were highly complex and maintenance-intensive, necessitating removal and extensive inspection after each flight. Before the \\"Block II\\" engines, the turbopumps (a primary engine component) had to be removed, disassembled, and totally overhauled after each flight. * The toxic propellants used for the OMS/RCS thrusters required special handling, during which time no other activities could be performed in areas sharing the same ventilation system. This increased turn-around time. * The launch rate was significantly lower than initially expected. While not reducing absolute operating costs, more launches per year gives a lower cost per launch. Some early hypothetical studies examined 55 launches per year (see above), but the maximum possible launch rate was limited to 24 per year based on manufacturing capacity of the Michoud facility that constructs the external tank. Early in shuttle development, the expected launch rate was about 12 per year. Launch rates reached a peak of 9 per year in 1985 but averaged 4.5 for the entire program. * When the decision was made on the main shuttle contractors in 1972, work was spread among companies to make the program more attractive to Congress, such as the contract for the Solid Rocket Boosters to Morton Thiokol in Utah. Over the course of the program, this raised operational costs, though the consolidation of the US aerospace industry in the 1990s meant the majority of the Shuttle was now with one company: the United Space Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Cultural issues and problems Some researchers have criticized a pervasive shift in NASA culture away from safety in order to ensure that launches took place in a timely fashion, sometimes called \\"go fever\\". Allegedly, NASA upper-level management embraced this decreased safety focus in the 1980s while some engineers remained wary. According to sociologist Diane Vaughan, the aggressive launch schedules arose in the Reagan years as an attempt to rehabilitate America's post-Vietnam prestige. The physicist Richard Feynman, who was appointed to the official inquiry on the Challenger disaster, estimated the risk to be \\"on the order of a percent\\" in his report, adding, \\"Official management, on the other hand, claims to believe the probability of failure is a thousand times less. One reason for this may be an attempt to assure the government of NASA perfection and success in order to ensure the supply of funds. The other may be that they sincerely believed it to be true, demonstrating an almost incredible lack of communication between themselves and their working engineers.\\" Despite Feynman's warnings, and despite the fact that Vaughan served on safety boards and committees at NASA, the subsequent press coverage has found some evidence that NASA's relative disregard for safety might persist to this day. For example, NASA discounted the risk from small foam chunk breakage at launch and assumed that the lack of damage from prior foam collisions suggested the future risk was low. Shuttle operations The original, simplified, vision of Space Shuttle ground processing Actual, vastly more complex and much slower, Space Shuttle ground processing The Shuttle was originally conceived to operate somewhat like an airliner. After landing, the orbiter would be checked out and start being mated to the External Tank and Solid Rocket Boosters, and be ready for launch in as little as two weeks. In practice, before the loss of Challenger, about half of the turnaround time after a mission was unplanned tests and modifications based on unexpected events that occurred during flight. The process usually took months; Atlantis set the pre- Challenger record by launching twice within 54 days, while Columbia set the post-Challenger record of 88 days. The Shuttle program's goal of returning its crew to Earth safely conflicted with the goal of a rapid and inexpensive payload launch. Furthermore, because in many cases there were no survivable abort modes, many pieces of hardware had to function perfectly and so required careful inspection before each flight. The result was high labor cost, with around 25,000 workers in Shuttle operations and labor costs of about $1 billion per year. Some shuttle features initially presented as important to Space Station support have proved superfluous: * As the Russians demonstrated, capsules and uncrewed supply rockets are sufficient to supply a space station. * NASA's initial policy of using the Shuttle to launch all crewless payloads declined in practice, and eventually was discontinued. Expendable launch vehicles (ELVs) proved much cheaper and more flexible. * Following the Challenger disaster, use of the Shuttle to carry the powerful liquid fueled Centaur upper stages planned for interplanetary probes was ruled out for Shuttle safety reasons. * The Shuttle's history of unexpected delays also made it liable to miss narrow launch windows. * Advances in technology have made probes smaller and lighter. As a result, many robotic probes and communications satellites can now use expendable launch vehicles, such as the Delta and Atlas V, which are less expensive and perceived to be more reliable than the Shuttle. * Advances in technology today happen much faster than in the years the Shuttle was developed. Thus the notion that Shuttle would be useful for recovering expensive satellites for return to Earth for refurbishment and updating with new technology is obsoleted; costs have dropped and capabilities increased so much that it is much more cost-effective to abandon old satellites and simply launch new ones. Accidents Challenger accident While the technical details of the Challenger and Columbia accidents are different, the organizational problems show similarities. Flight engineers' concerns about possible problems were not properly communicated to or understood by senior NASA managers. The vehicle gave ample warning beforehand of abnormal problems. A heavily layered, procedure-oriented bureaucratic structure inhibited necessary communication and action. With Challenger, an O-ring that should not have eroded at all did erode on earlier shuttle launches. Yet managers felt that because it had previously eroded by no more than 30%, this was not a hazard as there was \\"a factor of three safety margin\\" (in reality, the part had failed, and there was no safety factor.) Morton-Thiokol designed and manufactured the SRBs, and during a pre-launch conference call with NASA, Roger Boisjoly, the Thiokol engineer most experienced with the O-rings, pleaded with management repeatedly to cancel or reschedule the launch. He raised concerns that the unusually low temperatures would stiffen the O-rings, preventing a complete seal during flexing of the rocket motor segments, which was exactly what happened on the fatal flight. However, Thiokol's senior managers, under pressure from NASA management, overruled him and allowed the launch to proceed. One week prior to the launch, Thiokol's contract to reprocess the solid rocket boosters was also due for review, and cancelling the flight was an action that Thiokol management wanted to avoid. Challenger's O-rings eroded completely through as predicted, resulting in the complete destruction of the spacecraft and the loss of all seven astronauts on board. Columbia was destroyed because of damaged thermal protection from foam debris that broke off from the external tank during ascent. The foam had not been designed or expected to break off, but had been observed in the past to do so without incident. The original shuttle operational specification said the orbiter thermal protection tiles were not designed to withstand any debris hits at all. Over time NASA managers gradually accepted more tile damage, similar to how O-ring damage was accepted. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board called this tendency the \\"normalization of deviance\\" ‚Äì a gradual acceptance of events outside the design tolerances of the craft simply because they had not been catastrophic to date. STS-1 photo showing missing thermal tiles (left and right of tail fin) The subject of missing or damaged thermal tiles on the Shuttle fleet only became an issue following the loss of Columbia in 2003, as it broke up on re- entry. In fact, Shuttles had previously come back missing as many as 20 tiles without any problem. STS-1 and STS-41 had all flown with missing thermal tiles from the orbital maneuvering system pods (visible to the crew). This image from the NASA archives shows several missing tiles on the STS-1 OMS pods. The problem on Columbia was that the damage was sustained from a foam strike to the reinforced carbon-carbon leading edge panel of the wing, not the heat tiles. The first Shuttle mission, STS-1, had a protruding gap filler that diverted hot gas into the right wheel well on re-entry, resulting in a buckling of the right main landing gear door. Risk contributors Discovery at ISS in 2011 (STS-133) An example of technical risk analysis for a STS mission is SPRA iteration 3.1 top risk contributors for STS-133:Hamlin, et al. 2009 Space Shuttle Probabilistic Risk Assessment Overview (.pdf).

Ross were among those astronauts who believed that the shuttle was always an experimental craft, not an operational vehicle for routine spaceflight as President Ronald Reagan declared after STS-4. Rick Hauck said in 2017 that before STS-1 he saw an analysis estimating the risk of loss of the vehicle as one in 280, but an internal NASA risk assessment study (conducted by the Shuttle Program Safety and Mission Assurance Office at Johnson Space Center) released in late 2010 or early 2011 concluded that the agency had seriously underestimated the level of risk involved in operating the Shuttle. The report assessed that there was a 1 in 9 chance of a catastrophic disaster during the first nine flights of the Shuttle but that safety improvements had later improved the risk ratio to 1 in 90.Florida Today, \\"Report says NASA underestimated Shuttle dangers\\", Military Times, February 13, 2011. Retrieved February 15, 2011. In 1984 Reagan signed a National Security Decision Directive stating that the shuttle would not be \\"fully operational\\" until it could fly 24 missions a year, perhaps by 1988; the shuttle never flew more often than the nine missions of 1985, and averaged about six missions a year between 1988 and 2003. Although many NASA astronauts criticized the payload specialist program in part because they did not believe less-trained outsiders were fully aware of the risks of spaceflight, full-time astronauts may not have been either. Charles Bolden was amazed to learn after the loss of Columbia that the \\"impenetrable\\" leading wing edges of the vehicle he flew for 14 years were less than an inch thick. NASA in October 1982 predicted 37 shuttle flights by early 1986, but Challengers loss was the 25th shuttle flight. Hauck, with much experience flying dangerous aircraft at the United States Naval Test Pilot School, said \\"If I knew in advance that one in twenty- five would fail, I would probably think twice about flying three (as I did) out of the first twenty-six flights\\". Retrospect While the system was developed within the original cost and time estimates given to President Richard M. Nixon in 1971, the operational costs, flight rate, payload capacity, and reliability by the time of the February 2003 Columbia accident proved to be much worse than originally anticipated. A year before STS-1's April 1981 launch, The Washington Monthly accurately forecast many of the Shuttle's issues, including an overambitious launch schedule and the consequently higher-than-expected marginal cost per flight; the risks of depending on the Shuttle for all payloads, civilian and military; the lack of a survivable abort scenario if a Solid Rocket Booster were to fail; and the fragility of the Shuttle's thermal protection system. In order to get the Shuttle approved, NASA over-promised its economies and utility. To justify its very large fixed operational program cost, NASA initially forced all domestic, internal, and Department of Defense payloads to the shuttle. When that proved impossible (after the Challenger disaster), NASA used the International Space Station (ISS) as a justification for the shuttle. NASA administrator Michael D. Griffin argued in a 2007 paper that the Saturn program, if continued, could have provided six manned launches per year ‚Äì two of them to the Moon ‚Äì at the same cost as the Shuttle program, with an additional ability to loft infrastructure for further missions: Some had argued that the Shuttle program was flawed. Achieving a reusable vehicle with early 1970s technology forced design decisions that compromised operational reliability and safety. Reusable main engines were made a priority. This necessitated that they not burn up upon atmospheric reentry, which in turn made mounting them on the orbiter itself (the one part of the Shuttle system where reuse was paramount) a seemingly logical decision. However, this had the following consequences: * a more expensive \\"clean sheet\\" engine design was needed, using more expensive materials, as opposed to existing and proven off-the-shelf alternatives (such as the Saturn V mains); * increased ongoing maintenance costs related to keeping the reusable SSMEs in flying condition after each launch, costs which in total may have exceeded that of building disposable main engines for each launch. A concern expressed by the 1990 Augustine Commission was that \\"the civil space program is overly dependent upon the Space Shuttle for access to space.\\" The committee pointed out, \\"that it was, for example, inappropriate in the case of Challenger to risk the lives of seven astronauts and nearly one- fourth of NASA's launch assets to place in orbit a communications satellite.\\" There are some NASA spin-off technologies related to the Space Shuttle program which have been successfully developed into commercial products, such as using heat-resistant materials developed to protect the Shuttle on reentry in suits for municipal and aircraft rescue firefighters.

History Inside the top of the lighthouse Located at the mouth of Winchester Bay, Oregon, the first Umpqua River Light was built in 1855 and lit in 1857. Built along the river channel, the original light was vulnerable to seasonal flooding. This led to yearly erosion of the sand embankment of the light. In October 1863, the building's foundations had become too unstable and the structure soon collapsed. Before its collapse, the Light House Board had foreseen the need to build a new light at the location. However, it was 1888 before Congress approved of a construction of a new light. Construction started on the new light in 1892, and it was first lit in 1894. Built at the same time as Heceta Head Light, it was built from the same plans and is virtually identical to its more northern sister. Unlike its predecessor, the new light had several advantages over the original light. Built above the river, the new light was safe from flooding. This was partly due to the Light House Board's insistence that ships be able to plot a course based on visible lighthouses. The original light was not visible at sea and was only usable as an aid to ships approaching the river. The new light used a clockwork mechanism to rotate the Fresnel lens, and was eventually automated in 1966. The rotation mechanism served in the light for 89 years before it finally broke down and was removed. The Coast Guard, in charge of the light at this point, wanted to replace the mechanism with a new one. However, strong public outcry forced those plans to be aborted, and in 1985, the old mechanism was returned to its position after being fully restored. The structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Visitors can tour the lighthouse and adjacent Coastal History Museum from May through September. The museum is located in a historic U.S. Coast Guard station and features exhibits on the lighthouse, local history and the U.S. Coast Guard history on the Umpqua River.

He played college football at UCLA. Early years Sherrard attended Chico High School in Chico, California, where he was a multi-sport athlete, lettering in football, basketball, baseball and track. He moved on to UCLA as an unrecruited walk-on athlete and was redshirted after breaking his finger in fall practice. The next year, he suffered from mononucleosis when he reported for spring practice and registered only 2 receptions during the season, while backing up wide receivers Dokie Williams and Jo-Jo Townsell. Sherrard became a starter as a sophomore in 1983, posting 48 receptions (school record) for 709 yards. He also was the first player in school history to have 2 games of more than 135 receiving yards; 136 yards against the University of Washington and 140 yards against Arizona State University. The next year, he had 43 catches, becoming the first player in school history to have two seasons with more than 40 receptions, while also tallying a career-high 729 receiving yards. As a senior, he was having his best season until breaking his clavicle in the first half of the fifth game against Arizona State University. He missed five contests and returned for the season finale against USC. He also played in the 1986 Rose Bowl 45-28 win against the University of Iowa, where he had 4 receptions and one touchdown. Sherrard left as the school's all-time leading receiver in a season and a career with 124 receptions for 1,937 yards and 9 touchdowns. Professional career Dallas Cowboys In the 1986 NFL Draft the Dallas Cowboys traded up from the 20th to the 18th position with the San Francisco 49ers, in exchange for a fifth round draft choice (#131-Patrick Miller), in order to select Sherrard, who became only the second wide receiver ever drafted by the franchise in the first round (Dennis Homan was the first one in 1968). Sherrard started what seemed to be a very promising NFL career, becoming a starter in the thirteenth game against the Seattle Seahawks. He played in all 16 games (4 starts), registering 41 receptions for 744 yards, an 18.2-yard average (led the team) and 5 receiving touchdowns (led the team). At the time his totals ranked third for most receptions, third for most receiving yards, and second for most receiving touchdowns by a rookie in franchise history. In 1987, he came into training camp as the Cowboys best wide receiver, but was lost for the year when he was tripped by a defender during a scrimmage on August 5, shattering two bones (the tibia and fibula) in his right leg. He also missed the 1988 season, when he re-fractured his right leg tibia and also the shin bone, while jogging on a Santa Monica beach as part of his rehab treatment in March. San Francisco 49ers The San Francisco 49ers signed Sherrard in Plan B free agency in 1989, but put him on the Physically Unable to Perform list for the entire regular season, allowing him plenty of time to heal for the playoffs, where he caught 3 passes for 40 yards and was a part of the Super Bowl XXIV winning team. In 1990, he was off to a solid start, but broke his right fibula in a 20-17 win over the Cleveland Browns during the seventh game and was placed on the injured reserve list on October 29. He finished with 17 receptions for 264 yards and 2 touchdowns. The next season, he played in all 16 games, posting 24 receptions for 296 yards and 2 touchdowns. In 1992, he appeared in all 16 games (8 starts), tallying 38 catches for 607 yards, including 6 catches for 159 yards against the Buffalo Bills. New York Giants On April 7, 1993, he signed as a free agent with the New York Giants. He was off to a great start with 24 receptions for 433 yards and 2 touchdowns through the first 6 games, but lost the rest of the season after suffering a partially dislocated left hip and a fractured hip socket against the Philadelphia Eagles. He also had injury complications when he was diagnosed as having a blood clot on the same hip. His best professional season came in 1994, when he had career-highs in starts (14), receptions (53), receiving yards (825) and touchdowns (6). The next year, although he missed most of the preseason with a hamstring injury, he played in 13 games (13 starts), catching 44 receptions for 577 yards and 4 touchdowns. He missed the 12th and 13th games with a ruptured blood vessel above his right knee. Denver Broncos On May 5, 1996, he signed as a free agent with the Denver Broncos, where he only played one season as a reserve, before announcing his retirement on August 6, 1997. Sherrard persevered through multiple injuries and doubts about his future, to play 11 seasons in the NFL, recording 257 receptions for 3,931 yards and 22 touchdowns. Personal life Sherrard's mother Cherrie, ran the 80-yard hurdles in the 1964 Summer Olympics, where she was a teammate of Bob Hayes. She won a gold medal in the 1967 Pan American Games. His father Robert, played college basketball, semi-pro baseball and was a college professor at California State University. He is a cousin of Pro Football Hall of Fame cornerback Darrell Green.

History 1983-1987: The beginnings The Last Drive started playing under the name \\"Last Drive\\" in late 1983 and their first performance was at the \\"Rodeo club\\" on December 27, 1983. They adopted the name \\"Last Drive\\" after noticing a cocktail by that name at a bar menu. During 1984, Yiorgos Karanikolas was added on lead guitar. The group was basically playing garage rock mixed with rockabilly and surf rock. They started playing in underground joints of that time, while some band members played with Blue Light (group) at their first live performance at Pegasus club. In 1985 they released their first record, the 7\\" single Midnite Hop, which now is the most sought-after record by collectors in Greece. They also participated with a song in a compilation tape by Dikaioma Diavasis records, Live at the Kyttaro club. In 1986 they released their full-length LP album Underworld Shakedown, the content and the quality of production (by the Drive themselves) of which was considered by some as unusually high for the standards of the independent scene of that time. The LP contained covers of garage standards such as Misirlou and Night of the phantom, as well as their own material. 1987-1990: Europe They continued to appear live in Athens and many other cities in Greece, and in the spring of 1987 they toured abroad for the first time, in Germany, Italy, France and the Netherlands. They performed alongside the Fuzztones, the Creeps, the Stomachmouths, the Dizzy Satellites and others. In 1988, having replaced Nick \\"Pop Mind\\" with Panos Kasiaris on rhythm guitar, they released Heatwave, which was produced by Peter Zaremba of the Fleshtones. That was the album that brought them to the attention of Music Maniac Records, a German label specializing in garage-rock releaseses, which re-released it with a new cover. This release brought them to Germany, where they participated in the Berlin Independence Days festival and also recorded the Time EP. By this time the sound of the group had started to somewhat change, becoming harder and speedier and moving towards stoner rock and neo- psychedelia, without however burning the bridges with its garage past. The band also caught the eye of Paul B. Cutler, of Dream Syndicate fame, who would produce their next two records. 1990-1995 Their LP Blood Nirvana, released in 1990, marked the change in their sound, a fact that let down some of their hardcore garage fans and ended their cooperation with Music Maniac. At this time they were considered a part of the \\"explosion\\" of the hard rock/indie Greek scene that took part during the early 1990s. Thus, they started becoming more popular among rock fans in Greece, and on the same year they were voted \\"band of the year\\" by the readers of the leading music magazine, Pop & Rock. They played as a support act for the Wipers, The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Gun Club, and toured Germany with Dead Moon. In 1992 they released the F*head Entropy album, which is their most mature work. Following a tour in Spain, the Last Drive celebrated their 10th anniversary with a live performance (pie fight included) at the \\"West Club\\" on December 23, 1993. In 1994, their contract with their long-time company, Hitch Hyke Records, ended. They signed for the multinational BMG Hellas and released Subliminal, an album in which songs followed a somewhat slower tempo than before. In 1995, Karanikolas left the band and moved to the United States. Some months later the Last Drive was disbanded, after twelve years on the road, having created a dedicated following in Greece and abroad, and an explosive live act. 1995-2007: Intermission Yiorgos Karanikolas created the band Blackmail, who generally picked up from where the Drive had stopped, but with a greater emphasis on neo-psychedelia, and became quite popular at the time. Alex Kalofolias and Thanos Amorginos created The Earthbound in 1998, a band with a completely different orientation around ethnic/Latin/desert rock. There have been rare instances in which The Earthbound were joined on stage by former Drive members. Kalofolias and Amorginos also co-wrote the music for Stratos Tzitzis' film Sose me (Save me). Amorginos also wrote music for theatrical plays. Chris Michalatos played with The Speedballs a rockabilly act, for a while. 2007-present In early 2007, the band announced on their official website their reunion for some gigs. They performed live in Athens on May 11, 12 and 13th -all three dates being sold out- in Thessaloniki on the 19th and in Larissa on June 2. Their first record (\\"Midnite Hop\\") was re-released by Greek DIY label Blind Bastard Records. They also played at the \\"Open Air Festival\\" in Athens on July 6. Finally, they were the headliners on the first day of the \\"Indie Rocket Festival 2007\\" (along with the Devastations, Acid Cobra and The Cesarians) that took place in Pescara, Italy on June 22 . In May 2008 the band did another Greek tour, while a live CD-DVD covering their reunion shows in Athens was released by Blind Bastard Records. In the same year a film documentary was released entitled \\"20000 Miles Ahead: A Last Drive Story\\" covering their story till the reunion gigs. In May 2009, a new CD came out entitled \\"Heavy Liquid\\". In September 2009 Inner Ear released it as a limited edition LP (500 black vinyls and 500 red vinyls). In April 2010 an art and comics anthology came out, entitled \\"At The Drive Ink\\" with artwork by 31 Greek artists inspired by the songs of \\"Heavy Liquid\\". In October 2010 the band contributed the track \\"Love & Terror\\" to the CD/booklet \\"Horror & Romance\\", a compilation of songs and music inspired by Stefanos Rokos' art exhibition. In June 2012 the band released a new EP called \\"News from Nowhere\\" and shortly after the guitar player Thanos Amorginos was replaced by Stefanos Flotsios.

Impressed by the way Di Pasquale would monitor steroid use in the bodybuilding industry, World Wrestling Federation (WWF) owner Vince McMahon hired him in June 1992 to monitor the company's new drug testing program; at this time, McMahon was facing criminal charges for allegedly supplying steroids to some of his wrestlers in a manner that violated federal law and was hoping to regain public confidence. While working with the WWF, Di Pasquale took a hardline approach and ensured that anyone who failed a drug test would leave the company; such an example showed when WWF wrestler The Ultimate Warrior failed a drug test in September 1992.

M. and C. C. Wilmers, 2004. A local nearest-neighbor convex-hull construction of home ranges and utilization distributions. Ecography 27: 489-505.View PDFGetz, W.M, S. Fortmann-Roe, P. C. Cross, A.

View PDF The latter is a probability distribution that represents the probabilities of finding an animal within a given area of its home range at any point in time; or, more generally, at points in time for which the utilization distribution has been constructed. In particular, different utilization distributions can be constructed from data pertaining to particular periods of a diurnal or seasonal cycle. Utilization distributions are constructed from data providing the location of an individual or several individuals in space at different points in time by associating a local distribution function with each point and then summing and normalizing these local distribution functions to obtain a distribution function that pertains to the data as a whole.Silverman BW. (1986) Density estimation for statistics and data analysis. London: Chapman and Hall. 176 p.Worton BJ. (1987). A review of models of home range for animal movement. Ecological Modelling, 38: 277‚Äì298.Worton BJ. (1989) Kernel methods for estimating the utilization distribution in home-range studies. Ecology 70: 164‚Äì168.Seaman DE, Powell RA. (1996) An evaluation of the accuracy of kernel density estimators for home range analysis. Ecology 77: 2075‚Äì2085. If the local distribution function is a parametric distribution, such as a symmetric bivariate normal distribution then the method is referred to as a kernel method, but more correctly should be designated as a parametric kernel method. On the other hand, if the local kernel element associated with each point is a local convex polygon constructed from the point and its k-1 nearest neighbors, then the method is nonparametric and referred to as a k-LoCoH or fixed point LoCoH method. This is in contrast to r-LoCoH (fixed radius) and a-LoCoH (adaptive radius) methods. In the case of LoCoH utilization distribution constructions, the home range can be taken as the outer boundary of the distribution (i.e. the 100th percentile). In the case of utilization distributions constructed from unbounded kernel elements, such as bivariate normal distributions, the utilization distribution is itself unbounded. In this case the most often used convention is to regard the 95th percentile of the utilization distribution as the boundary of the home range. To construct a k-LoCoH utilization distribution: # Locate the k ‚àí 1 nearest neighbors for each point in the dataset. # Construct a convex hull for each set of nearest neighbors and the original data point. # Merge these hulls together from smallest to largest. # Divide the merged hulls into isopleths where the 10% isopleth contains 10% of the original data points, the 100% isopleth contains all the points, etc. In this sense, LoCoH methods are a generalization of the home range estimator method based on constructing the minimum convex polygon (MCP) associated with the data. The LoCoH method has a number of advantages over parametric kernel methods. In particular: * As more data are added, the estimates of the home range become more accurate than for bivariate normal kernel constructions. * LoCoH handles 'sharp' features such as lakes and fences much better than parametric kernel constructions. * As mentioned above, the home range is a finite region without having to resort to an ad-hoc choice, such as the 95th percentile to obtain bounded region. LoCoH has a number of implementations including a LoCoH Web Application. LoCoH was formerly known as k-NNCH, for k-nearest neighbor convex hulls. It has recently been shown that the a-LoCoH is the best of the three LoCoH methods mentioned above (see Getz et al. in the references below). T-LoCoH T-LoCoH (time local convex hull) is an enhanced version of LoCoH which incorporates time into the home range construction.Lyons, A., Turner, W.C., and WM Getz. 2013. Home range plus: A space-time characterization of movement over real landscapes. BMC Movement Ecology 1:2. .http://tlocoh.r-forge.r-project.org Time is incorporated into the algorithm via an alternative measure of 'distance', called time scaled distance (TSD), which combines the spatial distance and temporal distance between any two points. This presumes that each point has a time stamp associated with it, as with GPS data. T-LoCoH uses TSD rather than Euclidean distance to identify each point's nearest neighbors, resulting in hulls that are localized in both space and time. Hulls are then sorted and progressively unioned into isopleths. Like LoCoH, UDs created by T-LoCoH generally do a good job modeling sharp edges in habitat such as water bodies; in addition T-LoCoH isopleths can delineate temporal partitions of space use. T-LoCoH also offers additional sorting options for hulls, allowing it to generate isopleths that differentiate internal space by both intensity of use (the conventional UD) and a variety of behavioral proxies, including directionality and time use metrics. Time scaled distance The TSD for any two locations i and j separated in time by \\\\Delta t_{ij} is given by \\\\Psi_{ij} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta x_{ij}^2 + \\\\Delta y_{ij}^2 + (sv_{max}\\\\Delta t_{ij})^2} Conceptually, TSD transforms the period of time between two observations into spatial units by estimating how far the individual could have traveled during the time period if it had been moving at its maximum observed speed. This theoretical movement distance is then mapped onto a third axis of space, and distance calculated using standard Euclidean distance equations. The TSD equation also features a scaling parameter s which controls the degree to which the temporal difference scales to spatial units. When s=0, the temporal distance drops out and TSD is equivalent to Euclidean distance (thus T-LoCoH is backward compatible with LoCoH). As s increases, the temporal distance becomes more and more influential, eventually swamping out the distance in space. The TSD metric is not based on a mechanistic or diffusion model of movement, but merely serves to generate hulls that are local in space and/or time.

It is used as a point of attachment for the cheekpieces of the bridle and for the reins. It also has an effect on the action of the bit. Therefore, the design of the ring is something to consider when choosing a bit for a horse, even though the bit mouthpiece generally has a greater effect than the ring. Loose-ring (either side) and eggbutt (middle) snaffles. Choices in bit rings can be found in direct pressure bits such as snaffle bits or bradoons. Leverage bits such as the pelham, and curb bit have a bit shank rather than a bit ring. (see bit shank). The Kimblewick has a unique design in that the side of the bit resembles a bit ring, but actually is a very short bit shank, as it applies leverage pressure to the mouthpiece. Bit ring designs also are subject to fads. The loose ring is currently one of the most popular overall designs, but several years ago the eggbutt and dee-ring were quite common. There are also differences in the popularity of a given design from one discipline to another and from geographic region to the next. Loose ring Loose-ring snaffle. Types of Bits: Found on snaffles, gag bits, and bradoons. Action: The loose ring is a circular ring which may rotate around on the mouthpiece. The sliding makes it more difficult for the horse to tighten against it, promoting relaxation and chewing from the horse. The loose ring therefore keeps the bit more mobile than any other ring type. The ring will also rotate slightly before the bit mouthpiece adds pressure to the mouth, thus allowing it to give more signal than a more fixed bit. Disadvantages: the loose ring may pinch the corners of the lips as it rotates, causing pain to the horse. This is especially a problem if the bit mouthpiece is too small. If this occurs, a bit guard may be used. The bit mouthpiece should be slightly wider (to accommodate the bit guard) should one be used; it is best if it is at least 1/2 inch wider than required by the horse's mouth. There are some horses that dislike the rattling noise of the loose ring. Additionally, the loose-ring is more easily pulled through the mouth than a bit with cheeks. Size and Thickness of the Rings: Rings are generally 2‚Äì5 inches in diameter, most commonly ranging in the 2.5‚Äì3 inch range that is legal for horse show competition. Rings for bradoons are smaller than those used on a plain snaffle. Rings may be larger on gag bits, especially if the rider wishes to increase the severity. Thickness ranges from 10‚Äì23 mm, with most found at 15 mm. Mouthpiece: comes in many mouthpiece sizes, with 5\\" being the most standard size for the average horse, with a range from 3\\" for miniature horses to over 6 inches for a large warmblood or a draft horse. Various metals are used, and mouthpieces may be made in almost any type (see bit mouthpiece). Uses: One of the three most popular designs, loose rings are often used for training young horses, as the action is mild and the loose movement of the ring provides warning prior to rein pressure. The loose ring is the most common bit seen at the lower levels of dressage and on junior horses in western riding disciplines. It is also seen through all the levels of eventing (especially in the dressage phase), and is a common bit for race horses and some show jumpers. Eggbutt/Barrel head Eggbutt ring. Types of Bits: Found on snaffles, gag bits, and bradoons. Pelham bits also usually have an eggbutt design for the snaffle ring on the shank. Action: the eggbutt has a slightly oval (egglike) shape, and consists of a round outer ring attached to a more upright, straighter cheek which is fixed to the mouthpiece. The ring can move back and forth where it attached to the cheek, but does not rotate like the loose-ring, and so is more stable in the horse's mouth, and not as fixed as the other types of rings. Advantages: This is a mild bit and will not pinch like the loose ring. Disadvantages: It is more easily pulled through the mouth than a bit with cheeks. Size and Thickness of Rings: The rings range from rounder and thinner to wider and flatter in shape. Their thickness varies from 10-23mm, and most are about 3\\" across. Mouthpiece: This is also a popular bit that comes in many sizes, ranging from 3‚Äì6.5 inches. The mouthpiece is usually solid, but may be hollow mouthed. Uses: Eggbutts are overall one of the most popular ring designs, less common in the dressage arena than loose-rings, more often seen in show hunter disciplines. They are popular for riding schools, and sometimes in horse racing. Eggbutts are sometimes seen in eventing, show jumping, and equitation riding. They are occasionally seen in western riding. Eggbutts are also useful as a gentle design with which to start young horses. Dee-ring/Racing snaffle Dee-ring. Pinchless Dee-ring variation with decorative conchos added Types of Bits: snaffle. The Kimblewick shank has a modified Dee-ring design. Action: the Dee-ring, as its name suggest, has a ring shape like a \\"D\\" with the cheek side of the \\"D\\" attached to the mouthpiece of the bit. The straight bars of the Dee-ring provide a slight lateral guiding effect. This is because the bit ring is pulled against the side of the mouth opposite the rein that is activated, pushing the sides of the Dee against the horse's mouth, encouraging a turn. The Dee-ring is fixed in the horse's mouth, because its shape does not allow the bit to rotate. The Dee-ring is most similar to the full cheek. Advantages: does not pinch like the loose ring, and is not as likely to be pulled through the mouth as a loose ring or eggbutt. Otherwise is fairly mild, but acts quickly on the mouth of the horse. Disadvantages: Has little loose movement and thus provides less warning to the horse. Size and Thickness of the Rings: The ring is usually about 3\\" in width, although they may reach 5\\" (a popular size for race horses, but illegal for horse shows). The larger the ring size, the more lateral guiding effect it has. Mouthpiece: varies in thickness, and may be hollow or solid. Generally comes in a variety of sizes and a wide variety of mouthpieces. Uses: Another very popular design, the Dee-ring was the traditional bit used in hunt seat riding, and is still seen in that discipline. It is also one of the most popular designs in horse racing. The D-ring is not seen as often in dressage, eventing or show jumping. A modified Dee-ring design with the straight side and a rounder ring is sometimes seen in western riding. Full cheek Full-cheek bit Types of Bits: snaffle Action: The cheeks of these bits extend both upward and downward, tapering as they get farther away from the mouthpiece, with a half-moon ring similar in shape to the Dee-ring or eggbutt (depending on the design). The long sides provide a great deal of lateral guiding effect. The full cheek without bit keepers is more fixed in the mouth than a loose ring, and thus has a similar action to the eggbutt or Dee-ring. Use of bit keepers, however, makes the full cheek even more fixed than the Dee-ring, concentrating bit pressure on the bars and tongue. Advantages: The full-cheek is not as likely to be pulled through the mouth as a loose-ring or eggbutt and gives considerable lateral commands. Disadvantages: The full-cheek can easily jab or be caught on something if bit keepers are not used. In some cases, a young horse may be scared by the strong lateral pressure of the full cheek. Bit guards can help this problem. Adjustment: The full cheek should be adjusted like any normal snaffle, although it may be placed slightly lower in the mouth when bit keepers are used. When choosing this bit, it may be best to test ride with and without bit keepers, depending on the needs of the horse. Mouthpieces: Range in all sizes and thickness (10‚Äì21 mm). Usually in solid mouths, although hollow mouths are available. Uses: The full cheek is becoming more popular and is now seen in many disciplines, including dressage, eventing, show jumping, western riding and hunt seat. Additionally, the guiding effect makes it popular for use on young horses. Half-cheek/Half-spoon Half-cheek bit ring shown on a Dexter bit (also called a ring bit) Type of bit: snaffle Action: As the name suggests, the half-cheek has only a lower cheek, though occasionally the bit is put on upside down, with the half cheek pointing up. The cheek is generally flat and spoon-like, as opposed to the long, cylindrical shape of the full cheek. The bit provides some lateral guiding effect, and is more fixed in the mouth than the loose ring. Advantages: This bit is not as likely to be pulled through the mouth as a loose-ring or eggbutt. Additionally, it is not as likely to be caught on something, which may happen with a full-cheek used without keepers. Mouthpieces: Size varies, Mouthpieces come in all types, except waterfords are rare. Uses: The half-cheek is most commonly seen in driving classes, because it is less likely to be caught on the harness. It is also frequently used on young horses in Saddle seat disciplines. It is sometimes seen in horse racing. Fulmer/Australian loose-ring Fulmer snaffle. Type of Bit: snaffle Action: The fulmer is similar to the full cheek in that it has an upper and lower cheek, which taper off as they move from the mouthpiece. However, the ring to which the bit is attached is not an eggbutt or Dee-ring design, but a loose ring. This bit therefore gives the lateral guiding effect of the full-cheek, without the rigidity of many other bit rings. Advantages: Provides the rotation of the loose ring without as great a chance that the ring will pinch. Also prevents the bit from being pulled through the mouth like an eggbutt or loose ring. Mouthpieces: Usually seen in smooth single- or double-jointed mouthpieces Uses: not as common in the United States as other bit rings, but seen in a variety of disciplines Baucher/Fillis/Hanging cheek/Drop cheek The correct position of the baucher, with the smaller rings attached to the cheekpieces of the bridle. Type of Bit: snaffle Action: The baucher has an eggbutt-like ring at the mouthpiece for the rein, with an upper cheek that has a ring at its end, to which the cheekpieces of the bridle are attached. The mouthpiece of a true Baucher does not slide on its ring, though there are Baucher-like designs that do. This bit lies flat against the horse's face, is fixed in the mouth and concentrates pressure on the bars. Contrary to common belief, the bit does not exert poll pressure unless it is put onto the bridle upside-down. Advantages: will not be pulled through the mouth. Mouthpieces: All types. The Baucher however is traditionally just a single jointed bit, so you could not technically have a \\"waterford baucher\\". Uses: Not a common design, most often seen in eventing, during the dressage or show jumping phase. Also sometimes used by dressage riders. May be used in preparation for the curb bit. Is never seen in western riding, where it is illegal for show. *NOTE: the Baucher can be misused in an upside-down position, with the cheek containing the smaller ring hanging below the bit, as if the reins were supposed to attach at that point. Such positioning makes the cheek into a short bit shank, but without a curb chain, there is no poll pressure, merely a rotation of the mouthpiece onto the bars. This fitting is illegal in competition. Other * Full-spoon: similar to the full-cheek, except the cheeks are flat and spoon-like instead of round and cylindrical. The cheeks are generally shorter than those found on a full-cheek. * Flat-ring: Similar to the loose-ring, but the circular ring has been flattened so it has edges. Generally more common in western riding. Has similar action as the loose-ring, though is a little more stable in the horse's mouth and the rings may be less likely to pinch. * Tubular Butt: Similar to the eggbutt but with a sliding loose-ring and is suitable for use with reins that are connected with various knots. * Wing Cheek: A relatively recent innovation in snaffle cheeks, the wing bit offers extensive protection at the corners of the horse's mouth by having winged plates on the ends of the mouthpiece that curve around the side of the mouth. Essentially acting like a bit guard, these metal plates ensure that the rings of the bit do not rub or pinch against the sides of the horse's mouth.

The theory was formulated by psychologists Irwin Altman and Dalmas Taylor in 1973 to understand relationship development between individuals. Altman and Taylor note that relationships \\"involve different levels of intimacy of exchange or degree of social penetration\\". SPT is known as an objective theory as opposed to an interpretive theory, meaning that it is based on data drawn from experiments and not from conclusions based on individuals' specific experiences.Ayres, Joe. (2009). \\"Uncertainty and social penetration theory expectations about relationship communication: A comparative test\\". Western Journal of Speech Communication. 43. . 10.1080/10570317909373968. SPT states that the relationship development occurs primarily through self-disclosure, or intentionally revealing personal information such as personal motives, desires, feelings, thoughts, and experiences to others. Today, this remains the building block of relationship theory. This theory is also guided by the assumptions that relationship development is systematic and predictable. Through self-disclosure, relationship development follows particular trajectory, moving from superficial layers of exchanges to more intimate ones. Self-disclosure is the major way to bring a relationship to a new level of intimacy. SPT also examines the process of de-penetration and how some relationships regress over time and eventually end.  Assumptions  SPT is based on four basic assumptions. #; Relationship development moves from superficial layers to intimate ones. #: For instance, on a first date, people tend to present their outer images only, talking about hobbies. As the relational development progresses, wider and more controversial topics such as political views are included in the conversations. # #; Interpersonal relationships develop in a generally systematic and predictable manner. #: This assumption indicates the predictability of relationship development. Although it is impossible to foresee the exact and precise path of relational development, there is certain trajectory to follow. As Altman and Taylor note, \\"People seem to possess very sensitive tuning mechanisms which enable them to program carefully their interpersonal relationships.\\" # #; Relational development could move backward, resulting in de-penetration and dissolution. #: For example, after prolonged and fierce fights, a couple who originally planned to get married may decide to break up and ultimately become strangers. # #; Self-disclosure is the key to facilitate relationship development. #: Self-disclosure means disclosing and sharing personal information to others. It enables individuals to know each other and plays a crucial role in determining how far a relationship can go, because gradual exploration of mutual selves is essential in the process of social penetration.  Self-disclosure  The self-disclosure is a purposeful disclosure of personal information to another person.Howard, S. (2011). A Primer on Communication and Communicative Disorders. (1st Edition). Disclosure may include sharing both high-risk and low-risk information as well as personal experiences, ideas, attitudes, feelings, values, past facts and life stories, and even future hopes, dreams, ambitions, and goals. In sharing information about themselves, people make choices about what to share and with whom to share it. Altman and Taylor believe that opening inner self to other is the main route to reach to intimate relationships. As for the speed of self-disclosure, Altman and Taylor were convinced that the process of social penetration moves quickly in the beginning stages of a relationship and slows down considerably in the later stages. Those who are able to develop a long- term, positive reward/cost outcome are the same people who are able to share important matches of breadth categories. The early reward/cost assessment have a strong impact on the relationship's reactions and involvement, and expectancies in a relationship regarding the future play a major role on the outcome of the relationship.  Uncertainty Reduction Theory  Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT) is the process that people experience as they begin new relationships. When two strangers meet, they engage in this theory by asking questions of each other in order to build a stronger relationship. In the context of both URT and SPT, questions are seen as a tool for finding information about the other in order to receive rewards. These rewards are either physical/material rewards or abstract rewards that supplement the relationship as it develops. Rewards and costs of relationships in the context of the theories here are further expounded upon later in the article. Through this process of asking questions in a new relationship, the uncertainty and anxiety can be reduced and lead to a more developed relationship between the two people. Where social penetration theory postulates that new relationships (either romantic or platonic) steadily evolve into deeper conversations and interactions, uncertainty reduction theory postulates that these new relationships can reach that deep level through question and answer processes. Although SPT primarily focuses on the linear trajectory of the relationship as the two parties get a deeper understanding of one another, URT is relevant in that it focuses on each instance when uncertainty may need to be reduced through question asking on a case by case basis (i.e. the two people initially meet and questions are asked and later on in the relationship, one party asks the other to meet their parents and the two engage in URT to reduce the anxiety and uncertainty surrounding the situation). It is productive to view both of these theories in the context of relationships because they can encompass both the uncertainty occurrences in relationships and track the breadth and depth of the relationship throughout each of these occurrences. URT and SPT are bridged together throughout relationships.  Disclosure reciprocity  Self-disclosure is reciprocal, especially in the early stages of relationship development. Disclosure reciprocity is an indispensable component in SPT. Disclosure reciprocity is a process in which when one person reveals personal information of a certain intimacy level, the other person will in turn disclose information of the same level. It is two-way disclosure, or mutual disclosure. Disclosure reciprocity can induce positive and satisfactory feelings and drive forward relational development. This is because as mutual disclosure take place between individuals, they might feel a sense of emotional equity. Disclosure reciprocity occurs when the openness of one person is reciprocated with the same degree of the openness from the other person. For instance, if someone was to bring up their experience with an intimate topic such as weight gain or having divorced parents, the person they are talking to could reciprocate by sharing their own experience.  Onion metaphor  SPT is known for its onion analogy, which implies that self- disclosure is the process of tearing layers or concentric circles away. The onion denotes various layers of personality. It is sometimes called the \\"onion theory\\" of personality. Personality is like a multi-layered onion with public self on the outer layer and private self at the core. As time passes and intimacy grows, the layers of one's personality begin to unfold to reveal the core of the person. Three major factors influence self-revelation and begin the process of the onion theory, which are personal characteristics, reward/cost assessments, and the situational context. 435x435px  Stages  The development of relationship is not automatic but rather occurs through the skills of partners in revealing or disclosing first their attitudes and later their personalities, inner character, and true selves. This is done in a reciprocal manner. The main factor that acts as a catalyst in the development of relationships is proper self disclosure. Altman and Taylor proposes that there are four major stages in social penetration: # #; Orientation stage #: In this first stage, individuals engage in small talk and simple, harmless clich√©s like, 'Life's like that'. This first stage follows the standards of social desirability and norms of appropriateness. The outer images are presented and peripheral information are exchanged. # #; Exploratory affective stage #: Individuals start to reveal the inner self bit by bit, expressing personal attitudes about moderate topics such as government and education. This may not be the whole truth as individuals are not yet comfortable to lay themselves bare. This is the stage of casual friendship, and many relationships do not go past this stage. # #; Affective stage #: Individuals are getting more comfortable to talk about private and personal matter, and there are some forms of commitment in this stage. Personal idioms, or words and phrases that embody unique meanings between individuals, are used in conversations. Criticism and arguments may arise. A comfortable share of positive and negative reactions occurs in this stage. Relationships become more important to both parties, more meaningful and more enduring. It is a stage of close friendships and intimate partners. # #; Stable stage #: The relationship now reaches a plateau in which some of the deepest personal thoughts, beliefs, and values are shared and each can predict the emotional reactions of the other person. This stage is characterized with complete openness, raw honesty and a high degree of spontaneity. #; De-penetration stage (optional) #: When the relationship starts to break down and costs exceed benefits, then there is a withdrawal of disclosure which causes the relationship to end.  De-penetration  De-penetration is a gradual process of layer-by-layer withdrawal and it cause relationship and intimacy level to move backward and fade away. According to Altman and Taylor, when de- penetration occurs, \\"interpersonal exchange should proceed backwards from more to less intimate areas, should decrease in breadth or volume, and, as a result, the total cumulative wedge of exchange should shrink\\". A warm friendship between two people will deteriorate if they begin to close off areas of their lives that had earlier been opened. Relational retreat takes back of what has earlier been exchanged in the building of a relationship. Relationships are likely to break down not in an explosive argument but in a gradual cooling off of enjoyment and care. What is worth noting is that Tolstedt and Stokes finds that in the de-penetration process, the self- disclosure breadth reduces, while self-disclosure depth increases. It is because when intimate relationship is dissolving, a wide range of judgments, feelings and evaluations, particularly the negative ones, are involved in conversations.  Idiomatic communication in self-disclosure Within the coming together and falling apart stages of a relationship, partners will oftentimes use unique forms of communication, such as nicknames and idioms, to refer to one another. This is known as idiomatic communication, a phenomenon that is reported to occur more often among couples in the coming together stages of a relationship.Dunleavy, Katie Neary, and Melanie Booth-Butterfield. ‚Äú Idiomatic Communication in the Stages of Coming Together and Falling Apart.‚Äù Communication Quarterly, vol. 57, no. 4, 2009, pp. 416‚Äì432 Couples that find themselves falling apart reported that idiomatic communication, which can include teasing insults and other personally provocative language, overall have an adverse effect on the relationship as a whole. Therefore, this personalized form of communication acts more as a maintainer of a relationship and is not to be necessarily taken as a sign that a couple is moving upward or downward in their relationship trajectory.  Breadth and depth  Both depth and breadth are related to the onion model. As the wedge penetrates the layers of the onion, the degree of intimacy (depth) and the range of areas in an individual's life that an individual chooses to share (breadth) increases. = (1) Breadth = The breadth of penetration is the range of areas in an individual's life being disclosed, or the range of topics discussed. For instance, one segment could be family, a specific romantic relationship, or academic studies. Each of these segments or areas are not always accessed at the same time. One could be completely open about a family relationship while hiding an aspect of a romantic relationship for various reasons such as abuse or disapproval from family or friends. It takes genuine intimacy with all segments to be able to access all areas of breadth at all times. = (2) Depth = The depth of penetration is a degree of intimacy. This does not necessarily refer to sexual activity, but how open and close someone can become with another person despite their anxiety over self-disclosure. Doing this will give the person more trust in the relationship and make them want to talk about deeper things that would be discussed in normal, everyday conversation. This could be through friendship, family relationships, peers, and even romantic relationships with either same-sex or opposite-sex partners. When talking with one person over time, someone could make more topics to talk about so the other person will start to open up and express what they feel about the different issues and topics. This helps the first person to move closer to getting to know the person and how they react to different things. This is applicable when equal intimacy is involved in friendship, romance, attitudes and families. = (3) Relationship = It is possible to have depth without breadth and even breadth without depth. For instance, depth without breadth could be where only one area of intimacy is accessed. \\"A relationship that could be depicted from the onion model would be a summer romance. This would be depth without breadth.\\" On the other hand, breadth without depth would be simple everyday conversations. An example would be when passing by an acquaintance and saying, \\"Hi, how are you?\\" without ever really expecting to stop and listen to what this person has to say is common. To get to the level of breadth and depth, both parties have to work on their social skills and how they present themselves to people. They have to be willing to open up and talk to each other and express themselves. One person could share some information about their personal life and see how the other person responds. If they do not want to open up the first time, the first person has to keep talking to the second person and have many conversations to get to the point where they both feel comfortable enough for them to want to talk to each other about more personal topics. The relationship between breadth and depth can be similar to that used in technology today. Pennington describes in a study that Because of social media sites like Facebook, the breadth of subjects can be wide, as well as the depth of those using the platforms. Users of these platforms seem to feel obligated to share simple information as was listed by Pennington, but also highly personal information that can now be considered general knowledge. Because of social media platforms and user's willingness to share personal information, the law of reciprocity is thrown out the window in favor of divulging personal information to countless followers/friends without them sharing the same level of vulnerability in return. In cases like this, there is depth without much breadth.  Barriers  Several factors can affect the amount of self-disclosure between partners: gender, race, religion, personality, social status and ethnic background. For example, Americans friends tend to discuss intimate topics with each other, whereas Japanese friends are more likely to discuss superficial topics. One might feel less inclined to disclose personal information if doing so would violate their religious beliefs. Being part of a religious minority could also influence how much one feels comfortable in disclosing personal information. In romantic relationships, women are more likely to self-disclose than their male counterparts. Men often refrain from expressing deep emotions out of fear of social stigma. Such barriers can slow the rate of self-disclosure and even prevent relationships from forming. In theory, the more dissimilar two people are, the more difficult or unlikely self-disclosure becomes.  Stranger-on- the-train phenomenon  Most of the time individuals engage in self- disclosure strategically, carefully evaluating what to disclose and what to be reserved, since disclosing too much in the early stage of relationship is generally considered inappropriate, which can end or suffocate a relationship. Whereas, in certain contexts, self-disclosure does not follow the pattern. This exception is known as \\"stranger-on-the-train (or plane or bus)\\" phenomenon, in which individuals reveal personal information with complete strangers in public spaces rapidly. For instance, on a night coach from London to Paris, two individuals sitting next to each other may start conversation very soon, and somehow a wide range of topics including controversial and very personal ones may be discussed. In such situations, self-disclosure is spontaneous rather than strategic. This specific concept can be known as verbal leakage, which is defined by Floyd as \\"unintentionally telling another person something about yourself\\". SPT operates under the impression that the self-disclosure given is not only truthful, meaning the speaker believes what is being said to be true, but intentional.Floyd, K. (2011). Interpersonal Communication (2nd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Education. Self-disclosure can be defined as \\"the voluntary sharing of personal history, preferences, attitudes, feelings, values, secrets, etc., with another person\\".Griffin, E. A., Ledbetter, A., & Sparks, G. G. (2015). A First Look at Communication Theory (9th ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill Education. The information given in any relationship, whether acquaintance or a well-established relationship, should be voluntarily shared, otherwise it does not follow the laws of reciprocity, and would fall under the verbal leakage umbrella, or the stranger-on-the-train phenomenon. It is still a puzzle why such instant intimacy could occur. Some researchers argue that revealing our inner self to complete strangers is deemed as \\"cathartic exercise\\" or \\"service of confession\\", which allows individuals to unload emotions and express deeper thoughts without being haunted by the potential unfavorable comments or judgements. This is because people tend to take lightly and dismiss responses from strangers, who do not really matter in their lives. Some researcher suggests that this phenomenon occurs because individuals feel less vulnerable to open up to strangers who they are not expected to see again.  Sexual communication anxiety among couples  The rate of sexual satisfaction in relationships has been observed to relate directly to the effective communication between couples. Individuals in a relationship who experience anxiety will find it difficult to divulge information regarding their sexuality and desires due to the perceived vulnerabilities in doing so. In a study published by the Archives of Sexual Behavior, socially anxious individuals generally attribute potential judgement or scrutiny as the main instigators for any insecurities in self-disclosing to their romantic partners. This fear of intimacy, and thus a lower level of sexual self- disclosure within a relationship, is predicted to correlate to a decrease in sexual satisfaction.  Rewards and costs assessment  Social exchange theory Social exchange theory states that humans weigh each relationship and interaction with another human on a reward cost scale without realizing it. If the interaction was satisfactory, then that person or relationship is looked upon favorably. When there are positive interactions that produce good reward/cost calculations, the relationship is likely to be more satisfying. But if an interaction was unsatisfactory, then the relationship will be evaluated for its costs compared to its rewards or benefits. People try to predict the outcome of an interaction before it takes place. Coming from a scientific standpoint, Altman and Taylor were able to assign letters as mathematical representations of costs and rewards. They also borrowed the concepts from Thibaut and Kelley's in order to describe the relation of costs and rewards of relationships. Thibaut and Kelley's key concepts of relational outcome, relational satisfaction, and relational stability serve as the foundation of Irwin and Taylor's rewards minus costs, comparison level, and comparison level of alternatives. A major factor of disclosure is an individual calculation in direct relation to benefits of the relationship at hand. Each calculation is unique in its own way because every person prefers different things and therefore will give different responses to different questions. An example of how rewards and costs can influence behavior is if an individual were to ask another individual on a date. If they accept, then the first individual has gained a reward, making them more likely to repeat this action. However, if they decline, then they have received a punishment which in turn would stop them from repeating an action like that in the future. The more someone discloses to their partner, the greater the intimacy reward will be. When the individuals involved in the relationship hold positive values in this calculation, intimacy proceeds at an accelerated rate. In the relationship, if both parties are dyad, the cost exceeds the rewards. The relationship then will slow considerably, and future intimacy is less likely to happen. The basic formula in which some can process this in most situations is: Behavior (profits) = Rewards of interaction ‚àí costs of interaction. This means that people want to maximize their rewards and minimize their costs when they are in a relationship with somebody. According to Altman and Taylor, relationships are sustained when they are relatively rewarding when the outcome is positive and discontinued when they are relatively costly (when the outcome is negative). Outcome = Rewards ‚àí Costs A positive result will in return result in more disclosure.  Comparison level  The first standard that we use to evaluate the outcomes of a situation is comparison level (CL). As defined by Thibaut and Kelley, CL is the standard by which individuals evaluate the desirability of group membership. A group is defined as \\"two or more interdependent individuals who influence one another through social interaction\\". In this instance, the group refers to a dyadic relationship, but it can really be extended to any type of group. \\"A person's comparison level (CL) is the threshold above which an outcome seems attractive\\". That is, when groups fall above the CL they are seen as being satisfying to the individual, and when they fall below the CL they are seen as being unsatisfying. We take an average of outcomes from the past as a benchmark to determine what makes us happy or sad so that we may develop the threshold, or comparison level, in which an outcome appears attractive. Past experiences shape one's thoughts and feelings about developing relationships, and in this way, an individual's CL is very much influenced by these previous relationships.  Comparison level of alternatives  A person's CL is the threshold above which an outcome appears attractive. CL only predicts when we are satisfied with membership in a given relationship, or group. Therefore, Thibaut and Kelley also say that people use a CL for alternatives to evaluate their outcomes. Basically, CL for alternatives is determined by \\"the worst outcome a person will accept and still stay in a relationship.\\" As such, comparison level for alternatives is a better predictor for whether or not a person will join or leave a relationship, or group. However, even if a relationship is unhealthy, a person might choose to remain in it because it is better than what they perceive the real world to be. Trends and sequences are one of the major factors when evaluating a relationship.  Applications   Interpersonal communication  The value of SPT initially lies in the area of interpersonal communication. Scholars have been using the concepts and onion model to explore the development of counter-sex/romantic relationships, friendships, parent-child relationships, employer-employee relationships, caregiver-patient relationships and beyond. Some of the key findings are described as follows. Researchers have found out that in parent-child relationships, information derived from the child's spontaneous disclosure in daily activities was most closely connected to generating and maintaining their trust in parents, indicating the importance of developing shallow but broad relationships with children through everyday conversation rather than long-lasting profound lectures (Kerr, Stattin & Trost, 1999). Honeycutt used the SPT model, along with the Attraction Paradigm, to analyze happiness between married couples. While the SPT model believes that relationships are grounded on effective communication, the Attraction Paradigm believes that relationships are grounded on having shared interests, personality types, and beliefs. The results showed that having a perceived understanding of each other can lead to happiness between married couples. While the research notes that it looks only at perceived understanding and not actual understanding, it shows the importance of relationship development. The more that partners in a relationship interact with each other, the more likely they are to have a better understanding of each other. Scholars also use this theory to examine other factors influencing the social penetration process in close friendships. As Mitchell and William (1987) put it, ethnicity and sex do have impact on the friendship foster. The survey results indicates that more breadth of topics occurs in penetration process in black friendship than white. Regarding the caregiver-patient relationship, developing a social penetrated relationship with institution disclosed breadth and depth information and multiple effective penetration strategies is critical to the benefits of the patients (Yin & Lau, 2005). Nurses could apply the theory into daily interactions with patients, as doctors could in their articulations when consulting or announcing. = Gender-based difference in self-disclosure = Research demonstrates that there are significant gender differences in self-disclosure, particularly emotional self-disclosure, or expressing personal feelings and emotions, such as \\"Sometimes, I feel lonely to study abroad and to be away from my family.\\" Emotional self-disclosure is at core of intimate relationship developments, because unlike factual (descriptive) self-disclosure, or sharing superficial self-relevant facts, such as \\"I'm studying abroad in Japan\\", it is more personal and more effective to cultivate intimacy. Emotional self- disclosure makes individuals \\"transparent\\" and vulnerable to others. According to previous studies, females are more socially oriented, whereas males are more task-oriented, and thus females are believed to be more socially interdependent than males. This is one of the reasons that contributes to the gender difference in self-disclosure. In a friendship between females, emotional attachments such as sharing emotions, thoughts, experiences, and supports are at the core, while friendships between males tend to focus on activities and companionship. Overall, women's friendships are described as more intimate than men's friendship. In addition, there is a gender difference regarding to topics revealed. Men tend to disclose their strengths. On the contrary, women disclose their fear more. Both men and women are prone to disclose their emotions to the same-sex friends more, but women are prone to reveal more than men to both same-sex as well as cross-sex friends. What is worth noting is that according to a research conducted among Pakistani students, women extensively disclose their feelings, while emotions such as depression, anxiety and fear are more likely being disclosed to male friends, because men are perceived as more capable to deal with such emotions. = Self-disclosure in the LGBT community = Minority groups especially have a unique way of creating closeness between each other. For example, lesbian friendships and intimate relationships are reliant on mutual self-disclosure and honesty. Both parties must expose themselves for an authentic and genuine relationship to develop. The problem is that for many lesbians, this process is not always as simple as it may seem. Exposing one‚Äôs sexual orientation can be a difficult and grueling process and because of this, many lesbians avoid disclosing their true identities to new acquaintances. This leads these individuals to turn to their family members or already existing social support systems, which may lead to a strain in those relationships and a smaller social support system. Because of these difficulties, lesbians will limit who they choose to surround themselves with. A lot of these women involve themselves in groups that are solely made up of only lesbians or groups that are only made up of heterosexual women to avoid their true lesbian identity. Authentic communication is built on honest self-disclosure. This part of the relationship process lies heavily on exposing one‚Äôs personal values and self- concept. When a relationship is being created, innermost thoughts and feelings are shared and trust is built. It can be difficult for lesbian individuals to open-up about their sexual identities, because of the fear of being rejected or losing special relationships. A study was done to examine self-disclosure among LGBT youths. Through a series of interviews, a group of LGBT youths described their coming out experiences. They told the interviewers about who they chose to disclose their sexual orientation to and whether the disclosure had a positive or negative effect on their relationships. Results showed that more youths disclosed their sexual orientation to their friends than to their parents. A number of participants chose to disclose their sexual orientation to their teachers. Results also showed both positive and negative reactions. Some youth expressed de-penetration in their friendships after coming out, as well as de-penetration in their sibling relationships. Some participants expressed experiencing other reactions beside positive and negative. There were invalidated reactions, where a participant‚Äôs sexual orientation was dismissed as a ‚Äúphase‚Äù and neutral reactions, where the recipient of the disclosure informed the participant that they were already aware of their sexual orientation. Some participants expressed having mixed and evolving results. For example, a participant who identified as a transgender male said that his mother was initially fine with his sexual orientation, which at the time was a lesbian woman, but had a negative reaction when he later came out as transgender. A few participants mentioned that they had initially received negative reactions from friends and family after coming out, but that as time went on, their sexual orientation came to be accepted and the relationships remained intact. LGBT professionals often feel anxiety about disclosing their sexual orientation to their colleagues. Professionals who chose to disclose their sexual orientation have had mixed reactions in how it has affected their relationship with their colleagues. Some had had positive reactions, strengthening their relationships and their overall job satisfaction, while others have had the opposite experience. They feel that disclosing their sexual orientation hurt their professional relationships and their overall job satisfaction. The atmosphere of one‚Äôs office can influence their decision to disclose their sexual orientation. If their colleagues are themselves LGBT or if they have voiced support for the LGBT community, the more likely they are to disclose their sexual orientation. If they have little to no colleagues who are openly part of the LGBT community or if there is no vocal support, the less likely they are to come out. = Patient self-disclosure in psychotherapy = Patient self-disclosure has been a prominent issue in therapy, particularly in psychotherapy. Early studies have shown that patients' self-disclosure is positively related to treatment outcomes. Freud is a pioneer in encouraging his patients to totally open up in psychotherapy. Many early clinical innovations, such as lying on the couch and therapist's silence, are aimed to create an environment, an atmosphere, that allows patients to disclose their deepest self, and free them from concerns facilitating conscious suppression of emotions or memories. Nonetheless, even with such efforts, as Barry A. Farber puts it, in psychotherapy \\"full disclosure is more of an ideal than an actuality.\\" Patients are prone to reveal certain topics to the therapists, such as disliked characteristics of self, social activities, as well as relationship with friends and significant ones; while tend to avoid discussing certain issues, such as sexual-oriented experiences, immediately experienced negative reactions (e.g feeling misunderstood or confused) due to conscious inhibition. In psychotherapy, patients have to deal with the tension between confessional relief and confessional shame all the time. It has been shown that the length of therapy and the strength of the therapeutic alliance, the bond between the patient and the therapist, are two major factors that affect self-disclosure in psychotherapy. As SPT indicates, the longer patients spent time with their therapists, the broader becomes the range of issues being discussed, and more topics are marked with depth. The greater the depth of the discussions, the more likely the patient feels being vulnerable. Therefore, the trust built over time among the patient and the therapist is essential to reach a mode of deep discussion. To strengthen the alliance, cultivating a comfortable atmosphere for self-disclosure and self-discovery is important. = Patient/therapist self-disclosure = The condition of patients‚Äô with eating disorders have been shown to improve with therapist self-disclosure. In 2017, a study was conducted and 120 participants (95% were women) were surveyed. For the purpose of the study, appropriate therapist self-disclosure was defined as sharing positive feelings towards participants in therapy and discussing one's training background. The results found that 84% of people said their therapist disclosed positive feelings to them while in therapy. The study found that when therapists disclosed positive feelings, it had a positive effect on the patient's eating problems. Eating disorders generally got better with therapist self-disclosure. When the therapist shared self-referent information to the patient it created trust and the patients perceived the therapist as being more \\"human.\\" Patients with eating disorders saw the therapist disclosure as a strengthening therapeutic relationship. However, personal self-disclosure of the therapist‚Äísexuality, personal values, and negative feelings‚Äíwas considered inappropriate by patients. = Self-disclosure and individuals with social phobia = Social phobia, or social anxiety disorder (SAD), is a disorder in which individuals experience overwhelming levels of fear in social situations and interactions. Individuals with social phobia tend to adopt strategic avoidance of social interactions, which makes it challenging for them to disclose themselves to others and reveal emotions. Self-disclosure is the key to foster intimate relationship, in which individuals can receive needed social supports. Close friendship and romantic relationship are two major sources for social supports, which have protective effect and play a crucial role in helping individuals with social phobia to cope with distress. Due to the profound impacts of the anxiety disorder, it has been found that late marriage or staying unmarried for the lifetime is prevailing among population with social phobia. This is problematic, because being unable to gain needed social supports from intimate ones further confines the social phobic in the loneliness and depression that they have been suffering from. In response to the problem, Sparrevohn and Rapee suggest that improving communication skill, particularly self-disclosure and emotional expression, should be included in future social phobia treatment, so the life quality of individuals with social phobia can be improved. = Server-patron mutual disclosure in restaurant industry = As social penetration theory suggests, disclosure reciprocity induces positive emotion which is essential for retaining close and enduring relationships. In service industry, compared with securing new customers, maintaining long-term relationships with existing customers is more cost-effective. Therefore, engaging with current customers is a crucial topic in restaurant industry. Hwang et al. indicates that mutual disclosure is the vital factor for establishing trust between customers and servers. Effective server disclosure, such as sincere advice about menu choices and personal favorite dishes, can elicit reciprocity of information exchange between servers and customers. The received information regarding to the taste and preference of the customers then can be used to provide tailored services, which in turn can positively strengthen customers' trust, commitment and loyalty toward the restaurant. Hwang et al. suggest that server disclosure is more effective to evoke customer disclosure in female customers, who are more likely to reveal personal information than their male counterparts. In addition, studies have shown that factors such as expertise (e.g. servers' knowledge and experience), customer-oriented attribute (e.g. listening to the concerns from the customers attentively), as well as marital status influence mutual disclosure in the restaurant setting. Expertise is positively correlated to both customer and server disclosure. Server disclosure is only effective in inducing disclosure and positive feelings from unmarried patrons who are more welcome to have a conversation with the servers.  Organizational communication  The ideas posited by the theory have been researched and re-examined by scholars when looking at organizational communication. Some scholars explored the arena of company policy making, demonstrating that the effect company policies have on the employees, ranging from slight attitudinal responses (such as dissatisfaction) to radical behavioral reactions (such as conflicts, fights and resignation). In this way, sophisticated implementation of controversial policies is required (Baack, 1991). Social penetration theory offers a framework allowing for an explanation of the potential issues.  Media-mediated communication  = Self-disclosure in reality TV = Reality TV shows are gaining popularity in the last decades, and the trend is still growing. Reality TV is a genre that is characterized with real-life situations and very intimate self-disclosure in the shows. Self-disclosure in reality show can be considered as self- disclosure by media characters and the relationship between the audience and the media character is parasocial. In reality show, self-disclosure are usually delivered in the form of a monologue, which is similar real-life self- disclosure and gives the audience the illusion that the messages are directed to them. According to social penetration theory, self-disclosure should follow certain stages, moving from the superficial layers to the central layers gradually. Nonetheless, rapid self-disclosure of intimate layers is a norm in reality TV shows, and unlike in interpersonal interactions, viewers prefer early intimate disclosure and such disclosure leads to liking rather than inducing uncomfortable feeling. Heavy viewers are more accustomed to the norm of early intimate disclosure, because provocative stimuli and voyeuristic are what they are searching for in such shows.  Computer-mediated communication  Computer-mediated communication (CMC) can be thought of as another way in which people can develop relationships. Technology itself is seen as a medium that connects people who would otherwise be strangers through shared interests or cultures. The Internet has been thought to broaden the way people communicate and build relationships by providing a medium in which people could be open-minded and unconventional and circumvent traditional limitations like time and place. (Yum & Hara, 2005) Prior to the creation of social media and online dating sites, strangers could get to know one another through pen- pal organizations or meeting in public locations. With the influx of CMC and the advancement of technology itself, strangers are able to decide whether they will invest time in and develop a relationship based off of information that is provided in a profile. When someone sees that a person included a similar interest to them in their profile, the uncertainty becomes reduced and the two strangers utilize CMC to connect over their shared interests. As time has progressed, the stigma around online dating has reduced significantly and more research is being done in relation to SPT and CMC. When engaging in a new relationship through CMC, there are certain elements and nonverbal cues that are missing thus increasing the uncertainty in the relationship. With the more prominent use of such dating services online, relationship development itself has changed. Prior to the implementation of CMC to relationships, couples solely relied on face to face interactions, nonverbal cues, and first impressions to decide whether or not they would continue to develop the relationship further. The introduction of CMC in romantic relationships has added an element for all parties to consider when beginning their relationships. Whether they move forward in the relationships and develop it deeper can be decided fully off of CMC interactions that could potentially present a false image or notion of who the other person is. Some theorists find this concept of CMC impossible and there are barriers to this idea. Since there are risks and there is usually more uncertainty about whether the person on the other side of the computer is being real and truthful, or deceitful and manipulative for one reason or another there is no possible way to build a relationship. A lack of face-to-face communication can cause heightened skepticism and doubt. However, there are other researchers who have found that self-disclosure online tends to reassure people that if they are rejected, at least it‚Äôs more likely to be by strangers and not family or friends; thus, reinforcing the desire to self-disclose online, rather than face-to-face. (Panos, 2014) Not only are people meeting new people to make friends, but many people are meeting and initiating romantic relationships online. (Yum & Hara, 2005) In another study, it was found that \\"CMC dyads compensated for the limitations of the channel by making their questions more intimate than those who exhibited face-to-face\\" (Sheldon, 2009). = Celebrity's self-disclosure on social media = Social media has turned to be a crucial platform for celebrities to engage with their followers. On social medias, the boundaries between interpersonal and mass communication is blurred, and parasocial interaction (PSI) is adopted strategically by celebrities to enhance liking, intimacy and credibility from their followers. As Ledbetter and Redd notes, \\"During PSI, people interact with a media figure, to some extent, as if they were in an actual interpersonal relationships with the target entity.\\" For celebrities, professional self-disclosure (e.g. information as to upcoming events) and personal self-disclosure (e.g. emotions and feelings) are two primary ways to cultivate illusory intimacy with their followers and to expand their fan bases. What is worth noting is that unlike in real-life interpersonal relationship, disclosure reciprocity is not expected in parasocial interactions, although through imagined interactions on social medias, followers do feel they are connected to the media figures. = Social networking = Self-disclosure has been studied when it comes to face-to-face interactions. Since social networking sites are relatively new phenomena, there are not as many studies done about how people disclose information online compared to a one-on-one interaction. There have been surveys conducted about how social networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, LinkedIn, hi5, myyearbook, or Friendster affect interactions between human beings. On Facebook, users are able to determine their level and degree of self-disclosure by setting their privacy settings (McCarthy, 2009). People achieve the breadth via posting about their everyday lives and sharing surface information while developing intimate relationships with great depth by sending private Facebook messages and creating closed groups. The level of intimacy that one chooses to disclose as part CMC depends on the type of website they are using to communicate. Disclosing personal information online is a goal-oriented process. If one‚Äôs goal is to build a relationship with someone, they would likely disclose personal information over instant messaging (IM) and on social media. It is highly unlikely that they would choose to share that information in a website that is used for online shopping. With online shopping, the goal is to make a purchase and not to build a relationship. Thus, the individual would share only the information needed (i.e. name and address) in order to make a purchase. In disclosing information over IM and in social media, the individual is much more selective in what they choose to disclose. There was a study done about the connection on how couples or other romantic relationships have trust, commitment, and affection towards each other and the amount of self-disclosure each person gives to the one another. There are several criteria to the study. One important is how the couple met. If they met before talking over the Internet, they are more likely to reveal personal information due to the higher levels of trust. According to Rempel, Holmes, & Zanna (1985) the best way to be able to trust someone is to be able to foretell or calculate how another person will act or react to any given information. In other words, we are more probable to release information about ourselves if we can predict the behavior of the other person. \\"The hyperpersonal perspective suggests that the limited cues in CMC are likely to result in over attribution and exaggerated or idealized perceptions of others and that those who meet and interact via CMC use such limited cues to engage in optimized or selective self-presentation\\". (Walther, 1996) In other words, there could be deceitful or dishonest intents involved from people on the Internet. There is the possibility that someone could mislead another person because there are more opportunities to build a more desirable identity without fear of persecution. If there is no chance of ever meeting the person on the other end of the computer, then there is a high risk of falsifying information and credentials. Other theorists such as Rubin and Bargh say that because of the blockade of the computer, it increases how likely people are to be true and honest about themselves. There is also the idea that there will not be any fear of consequences for less than respectable decisions made in the past. Computer-mediated communication has also been thought to even speed up the intimacy process because computers allow individual communication to be more, rather than less, open and accommodating about the characteristics of the person or persons involved. Both ideas and types of theories can be proven and disproven, but it all depends on how an individual uses and or abuses computer-mediated communication. Research has also been done to see what types of people tend to benefit most from online self-disclosure. The \\"social compensation\\" or \\"poor-get-richer\\" hypothesis (Sheldon, 2009) suggests that those who have poor social networks and social anxiety can get more benefit by disclosing themselves freely and creating new relationships through the Internet (Sheldon, 2009). We can see from this that those who may be more introverted are more likely to disclose information on the internet. They find that it is a safe space, and it takes away the factor of having to speak in front of groups of people. However, other research has been done to prove that extraverts are more likely to disclose information online. This brings in the \\"rich-get-richer\\" hypothesis (Sheldon, 2009) that states that \\"the Internet primarily benefits extraverted individuals...[and] online communication...increases the opportunities for extraverted adolescents to make friends... [the research concluded that] extraverted individuals disclosed more online than introverted\\" (Sheldon, 2009). = Online dating = Some scholars posit that when initiating a romantic relationship, there are important differences between internet dating sites and other spaces, such as the depth and breadth of the self-disclosed information taken place before they go further to one-on-one conversation (Monica, 2007). Studies have shown that in real life, adolescents tend to engage in sexual disclosure according to the level of relationship intimacy, which supports the social penetration model; but in cyberspace, men present a stronger willingness and interest to communicate without regarding the current intimacy status or degree (Yang, Yang & Chiou, 2010). There are also many counter-examples of the theory that exist in romantic relationship development. Some adolescents discuss the most intimate information when they first meet online or have sex without knowing each other thoroughly. Contrary to the path stated by SPT, the relationship would have developed from the core ‚Äì the highest depth ‚Äì to the superficial surface of large breadth. In this way, sexual disclosure on the part of adolescents under certain circumstances departs from the perspective of SPT. Gibbs, Ellison, and Heino conducted a study analyzing self-disclosure in online dating. They found that the desire for an intimate FtF relationship could be a decision factor into how much information one chose to disclose in online dating. This might mean presenting an honest depiction of one‚Äôs self online as opposed to a positive one. Having an honest depiction, could turn off a potential date, especially if the depiction is seen as negative. This could be beneficial, however, as it would prevent the formation of a relationship that would likely fail. It could also cause the potential date to self-disclose about themselves in response, adding to the possibility of making a connection. Some individuals might focus more on having a positive depiction. This might cause them to be more selective in the information they disclose. An individual who presents themselves honestly could argue that disclosing their negative information is necessary as in a long-term relationship, one‚Äôs partner would eventually learn of their flaws. An individual who presents themselves positively could argue it is more appropriate to wait until the relationship develops before sharing negative information. In a separate study, Ellison, Heino, and Gibbs, analyzed specifically how one chose to present themselves in online dating. They found that most individuals thought of themselves as being honest in how they presented themselves and that they could not understand why someone would present themselves dishonestly. To say that most people deliberately deceive people in how they present themselves in online dating is not true. Instead they are presenting an ideal self. An ideal self is what one would like themselves to be as opposed to what they actually are in reality. One could justify this by believing that they could become their ideal self in the future. Some users might present themselves in a way that is not necessarily false, but not fully true either. For example, one could say that they enjoy activities such as scuba diving and hiking, but go several years without partaking in them. This could come across as misleading to a potential date who partakes in these activities regularly. Weight is a common area in which one might present an ideal self as opposed to an honest self. Some users might use older pictures or lie about their weight with the intention of losing it. For some individuals, they might present themselves in a way that is inaccurate but is truly how they see themselves. This is known as \\"foggy mirror\\" phenomenon. = Blogging and online chatting = With the advent of Internet, blogs and online chatrooms have appeared all over the globe. There are personal bloggers and professional bloggers ‚Äì those who write blog posts for a company they work for. Generally, those who blog on a professional level don‚Äôt disclose personal information. They only disclose information relative to the company they work for. However, those who blog on a personal level have also made a career out of their blogging ‚Äì there are many who are making money for sharing their lives with the world. According to Jih-Hsin Tang, Cheng- Chung Wang, bloggers tend to have significantly different patterns of self- disclosure for different target audiences. The online survey which involved 1027 Taiwanese bloggers examined the depth and breath of what bloggers disclosed to the online audience, best friend and parents as well as nine topics they revealed. Tang and Wang (2012), based on their research study on the relationship between the social penetration theory and blogging, discovered that \\"bloggers disclose their thoughts, feelings, and experiences to their best friends in the real world the deepest and widest, rather than to their parents and online audiences. Bloggers seem to express their personal interests and experiences in a wide range of topics online to document their lives or to maintain their online social networks.\\" As we can see, blogging is another medium that we can use to understand social penetration theory in today's world. Regarding online chat, research conducted by Dietz-Uhler, Bishop Clark and Howard shows that \\"once a norm of self-disclosure forms, it is reinforced by statements supportive of self-disclosures but not of non-self disclosures\\".

The chronicle was originally written by Leo of Ostia. According to both Chalandon and Lord Norwich, Peter is a poor historian and writer, much inferior to Leo. Reputedly a descendant of the Counts of Tusculum, he was offered in 1115 to the monastery of Monte Cassino. About 1127 he was forced to leave the abbey and retired to the neighbouring Atina (Atina, Lazio), because he had supported Abbot Oderisius, who had been deposed by Pope Honorius II. In 1131 he returned to the abbey owing to the death of Pope Honorius. In 1137, he appeared before Emperor Lothair II, then in Italy, on behalf of his monastery. The sovereign was so pleased with him that he appointed him his chaplain and secretary, and would probably have attached him permanently to his person had not Abbot Wibald considered Peter's return necessary to the abbey. In 1131 on his return to Monte Cassino Peter became librarian and keeper of the abbey archives, of which he compiled a cartulary (Registrum Petri Diaconi). Besides editing the existing chronicle of Monte Cassino (and introducing many falsehoods), he wrote several historical works: \\"De viris illustribus Casinensibus\\"; \\"De ortu et obitu justorum Casinensium\\"; \\"De Locis sanctis\\"; Disciplina Casinensis\\"; \\"Rhythmus de novissimis diebus\\". Peter forged, under the name of Gordian, the Passion of St. Placidus. He is vain and occasionally untruthful, but an entertaining writer. His works are in Patrologia Latina, CLXXIII, 763-1144.

It is located north of Cape Arago.  History  October, 1944 Starting in the mid-19th century, Coos Bay had become an important shipping point on the west coast of the United States. The amount of shipping at the time warranted the building of a light at the location, and in 1864, funds were given to build the harbor's light. In 1866, the first light was illuminated. This first tower, which housed a fourth-order Fresnel lens, was nothing more than a octagonal tower with a skeleton base. This tower, located on the west end of an island, was connected to the keeper's residence via a wooden walkway. However, because of its location on the island, the light was greatly exposed to the elements along the Pacific and soon was in need of repairs. Over the next 35 years, much of the station's infrastructure had to be repaired or replaced. Several improvements were also made during this time, including the installation of a fog signal and a new boathouse. The Cape Arago Light However, sailor's demands for a better light and the threat of erosion meant the end of the first tower, and in 1909, the second tower was lit. Located higher on the island, the new wooden tower stood tall and provided better illumination. Designed by Carl Leick, the new light was similar in design to Mukilteo Light in the state of Washington. Erosion eventually threatened this light as well, and in 1934, the third light was illuminated. Containing the second light's fourth-order lens, the third tower was made from concrete to better withstand the inclement weather of the area. This light shared a basic design with Point Robinson Light in Washington. It was also at this time that the first tower, which still stood, was finally destroyed. The second light fared better. The tower was soon removed and the building was converted into an office. Cape Arago Lighthouse, 1947 In 1966, the light was automated. Eventually, in 1993, the Fresnel lens was replaced with a modern lens. The light remained a beacon into Coos Bay for the next 12 years, until its decommissioning on January 1, 2006. Today, only the third light remains standing, all other buildings having since been demolished. The site is not open to the public, and the entire area is fenced off. In 2012‚Äì2013 winter, the original wood bridge accessing the light was eroded away by the sea. It is visible between Sunset Bay State Park and Shore Acres State Park, and from Bastendorff Beach County Park. In 1993, the light was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Having a characteristic bright but thin, breathy sound, the \\"Connie\\", as it was affectionately known, was designed for touring musicians. It was also intended to replace heavy tonewheel organs, such as the revered Hammond B3. While that goal was not entirely accomplished, the Continental became a very popular instrument, especially with garage bands, and it can be heard in many 1960s and 1970s hit singles by The Beatles, The Animals, The Doors, Elvis Costello, and The Velvet Underground. After being phased out of production in the early 1970s, the organ remained a sought-after combo organ by enthusiasts. In September 2017, Korg released a workstation-style keyboard named in honor of the Vox Continental and highlighting the particular Continental organ sound. Description Vox Continental internal circuits and components. The Continental had two basic designs, each with its own variations. They were the single manual Continental, and the dual manual model called the Vox Continental II in England and the Vox Super Continental in Italy. Vox Continentals were initially manufactured in the Jennings Musical Instruments plant in Dartford, Kent, UK, and by Vox Sound in Erith, Kent. Reportedly the English factories could not keep up with demand for VOX amplifiers and organs, and in 1964, a licensing deal was signed between Jennings and the Thomas Organ Company in the USA. In 1992, Korg acquired Vox. Since then new products carrying the trademark Vox have been primarily for the guitar player, and the Korg trademark appears on keyboards. The Continental is visually striking, with atypical features for a keyboard instrument. The most obvious one is its reverse-colored keys (black naturals and white sharps) similar to a harpsichord. Then the chrome Z-shaped bolt-on leg stand assembly and bright vermilion (in some models grey) top made for a distinctive and handsome piece of equipment. The Vox Continental used six slider-type, metered volume controls called drawbars instead of the stop-tab rocker switches seen on other combo organs. Two of the drawbars controlled the voices (flute and reed tones), and three of the other four controlled the footages (in reference to ranks of pipes on a pipe organ, but were essentially successive octave controls. The lower the footage number, the higher the octaves were pitched (8 foot being one octave higher than 16 foot etc.), the last of the four controlling a mixture of four higher pitches. There was a single-speed, single intensity vibrato, but the Continental had no other special effects or bass pedalboard. Its simplicity was appreciated by many players. Single-manual Continentals Although they had similar tones and appearance, Vox Continentals came from four different factories. The first were UK models built by Jennings Musical Industries, or JMI, in Dartford, Kent, England. Later UK models were built by Vox Sound in Erith, Kent. For a short time following Thomas Organ's 1964 licensing deal with VOX, single-manual Continentals were built in the US at the Thomas Organ factory at 8345 Hayvenhurst Avenue in Sepulveda, California. There were reportedly about 300 of these 301-H (\\"Hayvenhurst\\") organs made, mostly from April through June 1966. Production was then moved to the EME factory in Italy. Hayvenhurst Continentals are distinguished by their unique tone generator boards (sourced from Thomas' line of home organs), wooden keys covered in plastic, a feature shared by their Jennings-made forebears with a very nice \\"touch\\", and use of American standard hardware, which was a good deal more robust than the metric hardware used on the Italian-made Continentals, which make up roughly 80% of all Continental production. Hayvenhurst Continentals comprise only 3% of total single-manual production, with the balance being early UK-built units. Italian models can be discerned from UK and US models by their flimsy plastic keys, white and black (instead of cream and maroon) drawbars and crossed stand braces. Some think that the sound of the Italian versions was thinner than that of its UK and US counterparts, and that UK and US Continentals, as far as appearance and sound quality, were essentially identical (even though the US- built Continentals were somewhat different electronically from their English predecessors). The build quality and reliability of the US-built Continentals are held to be superior to the other three variations. Derivatives In the late 1960s and the early 1970s, various derivatives and variations came along, including the Vox Jaguar, Vox Corinthian and the last of the single manual Continentals, the Vox Continental '71. Dual-manual Continentals The UK had the Continental II and 300, and Italy had the Super Continental. Both had plastic keys and were available with and without percussion. Confusingly, the UK version with percussion (which only came with a grey and not red top) was known as the \\"Super II\\". The dual manual had its developments and variants. These included the Vox Continental 300, which introduced reverb and presets, and the Continental Baroque, which included different voices on the upper manual (including banjo, harpsichord and piano), as well as internal amplification. Artists The instrument was commonly heard in rock and roll of the 1960s, especially as played by Alan Price of The Animals, Mike Smith of The Dave Clark Five and Ray Manzarek of The Doors. Famous songs that feature the Vox Continental include: *1960s * \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\" (1964) and \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\" (1965) by The Animals * \\"Because\\" and \\"Glad All Over\\" (1964) by The Dave Clark Five * \\"California Sun\\" (1964) by The Rivieras * \\"Time Is on My Side\\" (1964) by The Rolling Stones * \\"She's About a Mover\\" (1965) by the Sir Douglas Quintet * \\"Pushin' Too Hard\\" (1965) by The Seeds * \\"Woman\\" (1965) by The Zombies * \\"Keep on Dancing\\" (1965) by The Gentrys * \\"I'm Down\\" and \\"Think for Yourself\\" (1965) by The Beatles * \\"96 Tears\\" (1966) by Question Mark and the Mysterians * \\"I'm a Believer\\" and \\"(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone\\" (1966) by The Monkees * \\"Hungry\\" (1966) by Paul Revere and The Raiders * \\"(We Ain't Got) Nothin' Yet\\" (1966) by the Blues Magoos * \\"Working My Way Back to You\\" (1966) by The Four Seasons * \\"Absolutely Sweet Marie\\" (1966) by Bob Dylan, who also played the Connie on the 1979 tour for his album Slow Train Coming * \\"Light My Fire\\" and \\"When the Music's Over\\" (1967) by The Doors * \\"The Rains Came\\" (1966) and \\"Mendocino\\" (1968) by the Sir Douglas Quintet * \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" (1967) by Van Morrison * \\"The Letter\\" and \\"Neon Rainbow\\" (1967) by The Box Tops * \\"Sister Ray\\" (1968) and \\"What Goes On\\" (1969) by The Velvet Underground * \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\\" (1968) by Iron Butterfly * \\"When I Die\\" (1969) by Motherlode Following the 1960s the Vox Continental played a significant role in generating keyboard sound of the 1970s and early 1980s new wave and punk rock.

He is based on the nursery rhyme character Little Boy Blue. At the beginning of the series, he is portrayed as an efficient but meek office clerk helping Snow White run Fabletown; however, he has a colorful and violent history that is gradually revealed as the series goes on. Appearance Throughout Fables, Boy Blue is depicted as a young man in his mid-to-late teens with blue eyes and blond hair. In Fabletown, he has his hair cut short and wears modern clothes in his signature color. He usually has a modern, valved trumpet of some kind on or near his person. He wears Chuck Taylor All-Stars. In flashbacks, notably \\"The Last Castle,\\" Boy Blue is shown as a medieval squire or page in blue livery, with hair that touches his shoulders. During \\"Homelands,\\" Blue, when not transformed or in disguise, is drawn with a blue cloth mask tied over his hair and the top half of his face, matching the dark blue color of the Witching Cloak. He carries a blowing horn. When Blue takes the shape of an animal for travel or concealment, the color blue usually remains prominent in some way: he is shown once as a mouse with a blue traveling cloak and repeatedly as a bird with blue feathers. It is not revealed whether this is because of Blue's affinity for the color or an inherent trait of the Witching Cloak. Character history Before Fabletown Boy Blue's backstory as a fighter against the Adversary's forces is revealed in \\"The Last Castle\\" as Blue tells Snow White the story of the Fables who defended the last open gate to the mundane world. This is at the tail end of the Adversary's campaign against the European fables, with most of them having either already escaped, enslaved or killed. Blue fights with Colonel Bearskin's Free Company, eventually becoming the colonel's aide-de- camp. As of \\"The Last Castle,\\" Blue has survived several battles: \\"Boxen, Ruby Lake, Oakcourt, and the hellish rout at Hollyfield\\", among others. The day before the last battle, a woman claiming to be Red Riding Hood rides into the fort nearly dead from arrow wounds. She and Blue quickly became infatuated with each other, to the extent that she suggests that Friar Tuck should marry them so that Blue will be allotted a seat on the last ship out. Citing his duty, he refuses. Arriving for battle in the morning, he learns his new orders: he will observe the battle from a high parapet and, at the appropriate time, will use a powerful but poorly understood item known as the Witching Cloak to teleport himself to the ship with the message that the last defenders have fallen and they are on their own. Fabletown will need to know what happened, Bearskin tells him, but he also sees this as a way for Blue and Riding Hood to be together. Unfortunately, when Blue arrives on the ship, he discovers that Riding Hood, not wanting to live without him, had given up her spot to a stranger and stayed behind. Fabletown Boy Blue first appears during \\"Legends in Exile,\\" working as Snow White's office gofer and clerk. He is one of the few people who can get Bufkin, the flying monkey who serves as Fabletown's librarian, to do his work. Blue is one of Fabletown's most skilled musicians; he takes his horn with him everywhere. He occasionally tries to get gigs in Harlem jazz and blues clubs, but is always told that he is too young, too white or \\"too hayseed\\". His roommate is Pinocchio; the two of them, along with Flycatcher are best friends. Blue lives a typical \\"nerdy\\" lifestyle, avidly reading comic books and playing board games. Blue's life changes in \\"March of the Wooden Soldiers,\\" when Red Riding Hood suddenly appears in Fabletown, claiming to have recently escaped the Adversary. She is initially angry at Blue, claiming that he had abandoned her to the Adversary's forces. However, she soon seeks him out and says she is sorry and wants to resume their relationship. After a sexual encounter, he realizes that she is not the Riding Hood he remembers. \\"Red\\" reveals that she is actually Baba Yaga using Red's form as a mystical disguise. Along with three wooden soldiers, she tortures Blue for several days, breaking all his fingers, before having the soldiers deliver him, along with a message from the Adversary, to the Woodlands business office. Against Snow's objections, Blue has Dr. Swineheart patch him up and bind the Vorpal Sword to his hands so that he can fight in the \\"Battle of Fabletown\\". In the street-level battle, Blue is injured by gunfire. After the battle, Dr. Swineheart's treatments allow Blue to regain full use of his hands. Return to the Homelands After Pinocchio is dismembered during \\"The March of the Wooden Soldiers,\\" Blue leaves for the Homelands, taking the Vorpal Sword, the Witching Cloak and Pinocchio's puppet body. Most of Blue's exploits there are detailed in \\"Homelands.\\" The Witching Cloak acts as Blue's impregnable armor; it cannot not be burned, stretched or ripped; it provides endless personal carrying capacity, and it gives its wearer shape-shifting abilities. Blue spends some time killing the Empire's soldiers, impersonating at least one governor, killing at least one dragon, and working his way toward the capital. While in Rus, the Homeland corresponding to real-world Russia, he kills three knights that are magically connected to Baba Yaga; the fact that their decapitated heads keep talking alerts Blue to the fact that she is still alive in Fabletown. During the Emperor's bimonthly public address, Blue impersonates a peasant so that he can get close enough to decapitate the Emperor. This reveals that the Emperor is only a giant puppet, like the wooden soldiers who'd attacked Fabletown. The Snow Queen encases Blue in a block of ice, trapping him. He wakes up without any of his magical equipment, imprisoned in Geppetto's cabin. He offers Geppetto, who still holds some affection for his first-carved son, Pinocchio's body to revive in exchange for two demands and one request: The full story behind the Empire's rise, an audience with the real Red Riding Hood, and a chance to speak to Pinocchio after his revival, respectively. When Red Riding Hood arrives, Blue discovers that woman he had met during \\"The Last Castle\\" was, like Baba Yaga, an impostor and spy. The true Red Riding Hood has never met him before. A heartbroken Blue calls the Witching Cloak to him, slays Geppetto's guards, and escapes back to Fabletown. Pinocchio, again intact but now under a loyalty spell to Geppetto, does not come with him. Blue does bring along the true Riding Hood, whom he feels is no longer safe in Geppetto's lands. Although the Fabletown community believes that Blue had stolen the Vorpal Sword and Witching Cloak, in actuality Blue had been sent on a secret mission by Prince Charming and has used the Witching Cloak's infinite storage space to store books from every library he'd come across. He brings Fabletown hundreds of volumes containing valuable maps and intelligence. Unfortunately, Charming is unwilling to make this knowledge public, so Blue has to stand trial. He is sentenced to two years of hard labor at the Farm. Rose Red, the Farm's administrator, considers him a hero and takes a very loose interpretation of \\"hard labor.\\" Blue leads the construction of Bigby's house in Wolf Valley and serves as Bigby's best man when he marries Snow. Blue nurtures romantic feelings for Rose. The war During \\"War and Pieces,\\" which tells of the war to reclaim the Homelands, Blue is given the job of transporting back and forth from numerous points to act as messenger and delivery boy to the Fables' strongpoints; Glory, Fort Bravo, Fabletown, Wolf Manor, the Farm, Haven, and the hotspot in the center of the Empire where Briar Rose is stationed. Everything runs smoothly until the Empire makes a final attempt to shift the tide. Blue is at Fort Bravo when a magic arrow is shot at Bigby. Blue tries to use the Witching Cloak to shield Bigby, but the magic of the arrow allows it to penetrate the Cloak, lodging Blue's arm and scratching Bigby. The effects of the arrow cause both Blue and Bigby to fall unconscious for several days. Upon awakening, Blue keeps what is left of the arrow sticking in his arm. Even wounded, he continues to use the Witching Cloak to retrieve and deliver weapons. He ultimately uses the Vorpal Sword to chop the head off the Emperor. Later, he, along with Pinocchio, retrieves Geppetto and brings him to Fabletown. Convalescence and death During the aftermath of the war, Doctor Swinehart removes the remainder of the arrow. Despite this, an infection sets in, causing Blue greater discomfort than before. These complications are later revealed to be caused by a minute thread of the Witching Cloak still lodged in Blue's arm, a problem possibly exacerbated by Mr. Dark casting his unbinding spell on the cloak before the thread is removed. Swineheart eventually amputates Blue's arm above the elbow. Boy Blue's condition continues to worsen despite both Frau Totenkinder and Doctor Swineheart's best efforts. After the collapse of Fabletown, he is moved with the other refugees to the Farm, where Flycatcher attempts, unsuccessfully, to magically cure Blue's condition. On Blue's deathbed, Rose Red immediately leaves her husband and tries to marry Boy Blue before he died, but Blue turns her down. He points out that she is only attracted to those who offer the most excitement, good or bad, and that he deserves better than her. He apologizes that she is broken but he is not the one to fix her. Blue requests that he be buried on a hill overlooking the baseball field in Haven rather than with the other war dead, to reflect his lifelong preference for a quiet life over heroics. Blue later meets up with Bigby in the afterlife to orient him (mentioning that Colonel Bearskin had helped orient him). They talk about the value of life. He tells Bigby he has no intentions of returning and says his final farewell. Before doing so, he tells Bigby there was someone else who wanted to see him (his son Darien) before leaving. Legacy Some of Blue's friends wonder whether he will return from the dead, as some Fables do. Pinocchio and Flycatcher conclude that, since Blue is only known to the mundanes in one nursery rhyme, it is unlikely that he will be able to come back soon or even at all. Nevertheless, Rose Red resolves to become a better person, someone worthy of Blue, by the time he returns, though this could be because she's too shattered by his rejection. As of issue 98, she has finally recovered from her sickbed with this dedication in mind and reunited the Fable community, in turmoil due to conflicts involving Geppetto's rights as a citizen of Fabletown. After Blue's death, the non-human Farm Fables, particularly Stinky the Badger, elevate Blue to quasi-religious status, wearing blue scarves as signs of their devotion. Stinky preaches with great conviction that Blue will one day return to usher in an age of great peace and equality. When Jack Horner returns to the farm during \\"The Great Fables Crossover,\\" Stinky and some others mistake him for the returning Blue in disguise. Jack is quick to take advantage of the situation. Clara notes with unease that Stinky's eyes, formerly brown, have turned blue. Despite this, Boy Blue has yet to come back and, although Mr. Dark was defeated, it wasn't by Blue. Stinky still believes that Boy Blue came back for the battle and that he and other followers missed it. In All in a Single Night, Rose Red visits a land of lost souls. A shadowy, semitransparent figure strongly resembling Boy Blue gets her to promise him a kiss, but when she learns he is noncorporeal, he tells her that her promise means she must also restore him to life. Whether or not this shade is Boy Blue is unclear, and Rose did not seem to recognize him. Ultimate fate Boy Blue meets Bigby Wolf shortly after the latter enters the afterlife and advises him of his options. He tells Bigby that he, Blue, is leaving to be reincarnated in a different universe so that he can have a chance at a quiet life with no heroics and that he might try his hand at falling in love. He requests that, if Bigby should manage to come back to life, he ask Brock and the others at the farm to stop worshiping him. The second-to-last compilation, Fables: Happily Ever After, shows Blue at an open mic night in another world, where he performs songs about his old friends. Blue briefly returns as a soldier in Rose Red's vast army when she raises vast cosmic powers against Snow. All in an attempt to gain yet more power from Snow. Rose, seeking advice from what she believes is a common sword bearer, realizes she is on a foolish quest after listening to a short tale from Blue. Inspired by this, Rose brings a successful truce. Relationship to the Witching Cloak In \\"The Last Castle,\\" Blue's commanding officer hands him the Witching Cloak so that he can fulfill a messenger mission. At that time, the characters know only a little about the cloak's powers. In a later chapter, Blue remarks that if he had known then what he later learned about the cloak's capabilities, he could have won the entire battle single-handedly. In the last pages of \\"March of the Wooden Soldiers,\\" the readers are informed that Blue has been practicing and experimenting with the Witching Cloak for several centuries: Prince Charming requests that the cloak be brought to him and he discovers that Blue has taken it and run off. In this scene, the readers are informed that many of the powerful magical items brought to Fabletown by the fleeing refugees had been assigned to Fabletown citizens who had been deemed capable of experimenting with them and figuring out how they work in case they are ever needed for the town's defense. Charming is informed that the Witching Cloak, although technically Fabletown property, had been assigned to Boy Blue. During \\"Homelands,\\" Blue is shown as adept at using the cloak for disguise, storage, concealment and protection. At one point, he uses the fireproof cloak to tie a dragon's mouth shut so that it will explode and die. He also uses simple voice commands to call the cloak to him from a short distance away and claims he can set it to self-destruct with all its contents. He uses this also as a threat against Geppetto (the Emperor) to prevent him to use it in battle against the fables in Fabletown. Blue eventually dies as a result of a tiny thread of the Witching Cloak becoming lodged inside an arrow wound in his arm, preventing it from healing. The Witching Cloak is drawn pink in \\"The Last Castle,\\" but at all other times it is drawn in some shade of blue. As of \\"Farewell,\\" no in-universe explanation has been given for this as either a genuine change in the cloak's appearance or a continuity oversight. \\"Boxing Days\\" reveals that the cloak was made from Mr. Dark's bag of nightmares, which is shown in shades of gray and brown.

The books are entitled Mother of the Believers, a historical epic that follows the birth of Islam from the eyes of the Islamic prophet Muhammad's wife Aisha, and Shadow of the Swords, a love story set amidst the showdown of Richard the Lionheart and Saladin during the Third Crusade.. Pasha wrote his first video game for the hip hop artist 50 Cent in 2008. The game, 50 Cent: Blood on the Sand, is the sequel to the bestselling 50 Cent: Bulletproof and is distributed by Vivendi Games. In 2008, Pasha accompanied his mother on the hajj, the traditional Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca. Pasha blogs regularly for the Huffington Post.  Early career  Pasha was born in Karachi, Pakistan, and migrated to the United States at the age of three. He was raised in Brooklyn in the predominantly Hasidic Jewish neighborhood of Borough Park. He attended Stuyvesant High School in New York, graduating in 1989. He went on to Dartmouth College, where he majored in comparative religion and was an editor of the college newspaper, The Dartmouth. After graduating, Pasha worked as a journalist for the Wall Street publisher Institutional Investor and the Knight Ridder financial newswire. During his tenure as a reporter, he interviewed international leaders such as the Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres, the Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto, and the Peruvian president, Alberto Fujimori. He left journalism in 1996 and attended Cornell Law School. He subsequently enrolled in the MBA program at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, and graduated with a joint law/business degree in 2000.  Move into film industry  Pasha briefly worked as an attorney at the New York law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison before moving to Los Angeles to pursue a career in film making. He attended the MFA Producers Program at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television and graduated in 2003. His first television writing job was as a staff writer on UPN's remake of the classic series The Twilight Zone. In 2003, Pasha set up his first feature film project, a historical epic on the love story of the Taj Mahal, at Warner Brothers Pictures. He subsequently wrote a screen adaptation of the Japanese anime Kite in collaboration with the director Rob Cohen and the producer Anant Singh. He has also written screen adaptations of the Japanese horror film Ghost Actress by the director Hideo Nakata and adapted Deepak Chopra's novel Soulmate. Pasha spent two years as a writer and co-producer for Sleeper Cell. In 2007, he signed on as a producer of NBC's Bionic Woman. Pasha wrote and directed the short film Miriam, which won the Gaia Award at the Moondance International Film Festival in August 2008.

The perception is that such a management style involves hasty decisions about things of which they have little understanding, resulting in a messy situation with which others must deal. The term became popular through a joke in Ken Blanchard's 1985 book Leadership and the One Minute Manager: \\"Seagull managers fly in, make a lot of noise, dump on everyone, then fly out.\\" As seagull managers only interact with employees when there is a problem, they rarely offer praise or encouragement when things are going well. When problems arise, they often seek to place the blame on other people, and to draw attention to themselves in order to appear important. They criticize others, but make little contribution to the solution of a problem. The seagull style of management may be indicative of a manager who is untrained, inexperienced or newly-appointed.

Written and directed by Kelli Herd, the film touches on themes of homosexuality, AIDS, coming out and small- town prejudice. The film stars Keri Jo Chapman as Alex, Teresa Garrett as Grace, Derrick Sanders as Mark, Timothy Vahle as Tomas, Nancy Chartier as Sloan and John Hallum as Spencer. Plot Alex is a married Junior Leaguer with a penchant for interesting shoes. Her Junior League chapter's annual project is to volunteer at Hope House, an AIDS hospice that recently opened in her home town of Azalea Springs, Texas. Alex and her League friends, including her friend Sloan, tour Hope House. Alex runs into her best friend Spencer, whose lover Bruce is a resident, and Grace, a friend from high school who had recently moved back to Azalea Springs to work at Hope House as a nurse. That night at the town's annual Azalea Ball, a drunken Spencer tells a society matron that his homosexuality was caused by drinking the local water. An equally drunken Sloan overhears and spreads the story. A panic ensues, with the local newspaper printing the story and commissioning testing of the water supply. Mark, the son of the publisher, objects to his father, but because Mark is himself struggling with his homosexuality and attending meetings of an ex-gay group at the local church, he's limited in what he can do to mitigate the story and the resultant damage. The leader of the ex-gay group, Brother Daniel, announces plans to protest for the closing of Hope House. Alex and Grace renew their friendship and Grace comes out as a lesbian to her. Grace returned to Azalea Springs because her husband found out about an affair she was having with another woman and is now in prison for assaulting Grace. At an ex-gay meeting, Mark meets Tomas, a painter. Mark hires Tomas to re-paint his dining room. The Junior League decides not to continue volunteering at Hope House. Alex, who's resigned from the League, goes to work full-time at the hospice over her husband Robert's objections. Alex develops some curiosity about her possible lesbianism and rents a number of classic lesbian-themed films: Desert Hearts; Lianna; Personal Best; Heavenly Creatures; Bar Girls; Claire of the Moon; The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love; an unnamed, presumably pornographic video; and, mixed in among them, The Godfather Part III, which serves as mainstream cover for the other selections and elicits a bemused look from the counter clerk, who has been loudly reading out the titles. At Hope House, Alex gives in to her growing attraction to Grace and they kiss passionately in a supply room. Sloan catches them and spreads the story all over town. After Tomas paints Mark's dining room, they go out on a dinner date, where Mark learns that Tomas stumbled into the ex-gay meeting by mistake. After dinner they go to Tomas's studio and Tomas shows Mark his paintings. They make love. Reaction is immediate and hostile, with Alex suffering indignities great and small, everything from the breakup of her marriage to the closing of her credit account at the local fried pie shop. Following this, Mark gains the courage to break up with the woman he's been dating as a \\"beard\\" and to come out to his father. He demands that his father drop the story on the water supply (testing proves that the water is completely ordinary) and stop the negative coverage of Hope House. Mark and Tomas and Alex and Grace go out dancing at a big-city gay club, where they see Ray Ray, the son of Alex's family housekeeper, performing as a drag queen called Obsession. Ray Ray leads Mark and Tomas to a leather bar where they catch ex-gay leader Brother Daniel in full leather gear (Mark has a photo published in the paper to discredit Brother Daniel's anti-Hope House protests). Meanwhile, Alex and Grace go to a hotel room where they make love for the first time. Back in Azalea Springs, Spencer's lover Bruce dies of AIDS-related complications. At his funeral, Alex's father comforts her and her mother, while still upset over Alex's lesbianism, shows that she still loves her daughter (by insulting her shoes, something she's done repeatedly through the film).

Early life and career Mahkamov was born into a working-class family in the northern city of Khujand on April 16, 1932. He graduated from Dushanbe Industrial Technicom in 1950 and from the Leningrad Mining Institute in 1953 with a degree in engineering. He worked as a professor, head engineer, and director of a mine in Isfara. In 1957 he became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and quickly worked his way into the high ranks of the Communist Party of Tajikistan, becoming head of the prestigious Committee of the Representatives of the Workers of Leninabad. In 1963 Mahkamov was appointed to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Tajikistan and from 1963 until 1982 he was Head of the Central Planning and the Vice-Director of the Cabinet of the Ministers of Tajikistan, one of the most power positions in the republic. Leader of Tajikistan In 1985 Rahmon Nabiyev was ousted in a corruption scandal as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan and Mahkamov was chosen to succeed him. Mahkamov's tenure was one of the most turbulent in the republic's history. His accession to power coincided with that of Mikhail Gorbachev and the advent of Perestroika and Glasnost. During Mahkamov's reign in power Tajikistan saw a surge in nationalism, which culminated in the passage of the 1989 ‚Äò‚ÄôLanguage Law‚Äô‚Äô that designated Tajik the official language of the republic. This law elicited a great deal of fear among the population and an exodus of the non-Central Asian population began, especially amongst ethnic Russians, Jews and Germans.John Payne, \\"Tadzhiks\\" chapter in The Nationalities Question in the Soviet Union. London: Longman. 1990. The greatest threat to Mahkamov's power came during the February 1990 Dushanbe riots that rocked the capital. Tajik youths clashed with non-Tajiks and battles were fought in the streets of Dushanbe between rioters and police and soldiers, resulting in dozens of deaths. Mahkamov oversaw a crackdown on Islamic fundamentalists and a lengthy curfew was put in place. He served as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (head of state) from 12 April to 30 November 1990. As part of the political reforms that Gorbachev was instituting the Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan appointed Mahkamov the first President of Tajikistan on 30 November 1990. Mahkamov's fall from power came in August 1991 when he supported the failed August Coup by hardliners in Moscow. Protestors took to the streets and demanded Mahkamov's ouster from power and on August 31, 1991 he resigned his positions as President and First Secretary. Mahkamov then retired from politics and sat on the sidelines during the ensuing political instability and Civil War in Tajikistan. In 2000 Mahkamov was appointed a member of the National Assembly of Tajikistan by the order of the President Emomali Rahmonov. He died on 8 June 2016 at the age of 84.

A biunitary element h of a semiheap satisfies [h,h,k] = k = [k,h,h] for every k in H. A heap is a semiheap in which every element is biunitary. The term heap is derived from –≥—Ä—É–¥–∞, Russian for \\"heap\\", \\"pile\\", or \\"stack\\". Anton Sushkevich used the term in his Theory of Generalized Groups (1937) which influenced Viktor Wagner, promulgator of semiheaps, heaps, and generalized heaps.C.D. Hollings & M.V. Lawson (2017) Wagner's Theory of Generalised Heaps, Springer books –ì—Ä—É–¥–∞ contrasts with –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø–∞ (group) which was taken into Russian by transliteration. Indeed, a heap has been called a groud in English text.Schein (1979) pp.101‚Äì102: footnote (o)) Examples  Two element heap  Turn H=\\\\\\\\{a,b\\\\\\\\} into the cyclic group C_2, by defining a the identity element, and bb = a. Then it produces the following heap: :[a,a,a]=a,\\\\, [a,a,b]=b,\\\\, [b,a,a]=b,\\\\, [b,a,b]=a, :[a,b,a]=b,\\\\, [a,b,b]=a,\\\\, [b,b,a]=a,\\\\, [b,b,b]=b. Defining b as the identity element and aa=b would have given the same heap.  Heap of integers  If x,y,z are integers, we can set [x,y,z]=x-y+z to produce a heap. We can then choose any integer k to be the identity of a new group on the set of integers, with the operation * :x*y = x+y-k and inverse :x^{-1} = 2k-x. Heap of a groupoid with two objects One may generalize the notion of the heap of a group to the case of a groupoid which has two objects A and B when viewed as a category. The elements of the heap may be identified with the morphisms from A to B, such that three morphisms x, y, z define a heap operation according to: :[x,y,z] = x y^{-1} z . This reduces to the heap of a group if a particular morphism between the two objects is chosen as the identity. This intuitively relates the description of isomorphisms between two objects as a heap and the description of isomorphisms between multiple objects as a groupoid. Heterogeneous relations Let A and B be different sets and \\\\mathcal{B}(A,B) the collection of heterogeneous relations between them. For p, \\\\ q,\\\\ r \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B}(A,B) define the ternary operator [p,\\\\ q,\\\\ r] \\\\ = \\\\ p q^T r where qT is the converse relation of q. The result of this composition is also in \\\\mathcal{B}(A,B) so a mathematical structure has been formed by the ternary operation.Christopher Hollings (2014) Mathematics across the Iron Curtain: a history of the algebraic theory of semigroups, pages 264,5, History of Mathematics 41, American Mathematical Society Viktor Wagner was motivated to form this heap by his study of transition maps in an atlas which are partial functions.Vagner (1968) Thus a heap is more than a tweak of a group: it is a general concept including a group as a trivial case. Theorems Theorem: A semiheap with a biunitary element e may be considered an involuted semigroup with operation give by ab = [a, e, b] and involution by a‚Äì1 = [e, a, e]. Theorem: Every semiheap may be embedded in an involuted semigroup. As in the study of semigroups, the structure of semiheaps is described in terms of ideals with an \\"i-simple semiheap\\" being one with no proper ideals. Mustafaeva translated the Green's relations of semigroup theory to semiheaps and defined a œÅ class to be those elements generating the same principle two-sided ideal. He then proved that no i-simple semiheap can have more than two œÅ classes. L. G. Mustafaev (1966) \\"Ideal equivalences of semiheaps\\" He also described regularity classes of a semiheap S: :D(m,n)\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\\\\\{a: \\\\exists x\\\\in S \\\\ \\\\ a \\\\ = \\\\ a^n x a^m \\\\\\\\} where n and m have the same parity and the ternary operation of the semiheap applies at the left of a string from S. He proves that S can have at most 5 regularity classes. Mustafaev calls an ideal B \\"isolated\\" when a^n \\\\in B \\\\implies a \\\\in B .

The Blackwater joins the Nottoway River to form the Chowan River, which empties into Albemarle Sound. The Blackwater-Nottoway confluence forms the boundary between Virginia and North Carolina.  Overview  The Blackwater River is a true blackwater river. Its water is clear, dark, slightly acidic, and tannin stained. Its drainage basin contains many swamps. The river's flood plain is mostly forested and swampy, including bald cypress and tupelo swamp forests. The upper Blackwater River is called Blackwater Swamp. In this region of Virginia, many streams are called \\"swamps\\" but still function like streams in being long and linear, with water moving from one end to the other and laid out in a normal stream tributary network. In contrast, some of the region's wetlands are not streams, such as the bog-like pocosins found on the higher land between swamp-stream drainages. The Blackwater River was a transportation route in the 17th and 18th centuries, connecting the Chesapeake Bay settlements with the Albemarle Settlements. It was one of the few rivers of colonial Virginia that did not empty into Chesapeake Bay yet lay close to the colony's oldest settlements on the James River. Settlements in the Blackwater's drainage basin were founded very early in Virginia's history. As a result, the Blackwater River became one of the early migration routes southward from the James River into the region then called Southside Virginia, and beyond into the Albemarle District of Carolina (later North Carolina). Today's usual definition of Southside differs somewhat from that of colonial times. Course The Blackwater River originates in several swamps within, or just south of, the city of Petersburg. It flows southeast through Prince George County, where it is called Blackwater Swamp. It then forms part of the border between Surry County and Sussex County, where its name becomes Blackwater River. It collects tributaries called Warwick Swamp, Otterdam Swamp, Coppahaunk Swamp, and Cypress Swamp. In southern Surry County, the Blackwater River turns south and forms the border between Isle of Wight County and Southampton County. It collects tributaries called Terrapin Swamp, Antioch Swamp, Seacock Swamp, Corrowaugh Swamp, and Kingsale Swamp. The city of Franklin lies on its west bank at the river's head of navigation. While canoes and other small boats plied the Blackwater upstream of Franklin in colonial times (and still do today), in the steamboat era, navigation was restricted to the river downstream of Franklin. South of Franklin, the Blackwater River forms the border between Southampton County and Suffolk. About nine miles (14 km) south of Franklin, on the border between Virginia and North Carolina, the Blackwater River is joined by the Nottoway River, forming the Chowan River, which continues south to Albemarle Sound. The boundary between Virginia and North Carolina runs west from the Atlantic Ocean, striking the Blackwater River about a half mile (1 km) north of the confluence with the Nottoway River. From there the state line follows the Blackwater River south to the confluence, then continues west. The watershed of the Blackwater River contains a portion of three cities and five counties of Virginia: the cities of Franklin, Petersburg, and Suffolk, and the counties of Isle of Wight, Prince George, Southampton, Surry, and Sussex. Natural history The Blackwater River is, as its name implies, a blackwater river -- its waters are clear, dark, acidic, low in nutrients, and tannin stained. Several environmental factors cause the blackwater condition. The many forested wetlands along the river include Streamhead Pocosins and Bald Cypress and Tupelo Swamps. The Blackwater is known for its pocosins, including the rare type called streamhead pocosin. The only two streamhead pocosins known in Virginia are on the Blackwater River. Bald Cypress and Tupelo Swamps occur along many streams of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Most were logged, thus old- growth examples are rare. The Blackwater River Preserve protects one of the oldest bald cypress and tupelo swamp forests in the South, with trees up to 800 years old. The largest known water tupelo in the United States, according to the National Register of Big Trees, is in Isle of Wight County. It stands tall with a circumference of . Another stand of old-growth bald cypress and tupelo forest, known as Dendron Swamp, was recently designated a Natural Area Preserve by the Virginia Department of Conservation of Recreation. Another rare type of forest found along the Blackwater River is a type called Longleaf Pine and Mixed Pine Flatwoods. The forests were once common in southeastern Virginia, but today are restricted, in Virginia, to a few small sites on the east side of the Blackwater River. Near the town of Zuni, Virginia, one stand is protected by the Blackwater Ecological Preserve. The Red-cockaded woodpecker is endemic to the flatwoods ecosystem and the Blackwater River is the northern range of this woodpecker. Many species of reptiles and amphibians depend on the long leaf pine ecosystem. The Blackwater River is one of the few locations in Virginia that has over thirty species of amphibians. The many old forests and wetlands along the Blackwater River have made it popular for recreational canoeing. Fishing The Blackwater originates as a coastal plain swamp in Prince George County. It flows east through braided channels of bald cypress and tupelo in Surry County. The river then turns south into Southampton County where several boat ramps are accessible for anglers, hunters and boaters alike. The Blackwater then joins with the Nottoway to form the Chowan at the Virginia-North Carolina state line. On any one trip you can see whitetail deer, numerous waterfowl, raccoons, squirrels and many unique reptile and amphibian species, not to mention a healthy fish population swimming under the water's surface. The dark, tannin stained waters of the Blackwater River host runs of striped bass, river herring (alewives and blueback), American and hickory shad in the spring. Angling for redbreast sunfish (\\"red throats\\" or \\"red robins\\") is also quite good in the spring. The river also hosts largemouth bass, bluegill, crappie, flier, and chain pickerel populations. Bowfin and gar are common in the lower main stem. Angling for bowfin provides a great opportunity to catch many hard-fighting fish in a short amount of time. The possibility also exists to land a trophy bowfin over ten pounds. Canoeing and kayaking Boy Scouts canoeing on the Blackwater River, Virginia Recreational opportunities are limited to some bridge crossings, state boat ramps, and canoe access areas. No permits are required. Boat ramps can be found at Routes 611 (Joyner's Bridge Rd) and 603 off Route 258 in Isle of Wight County. A new double-lane boat ramp with paved parking will be open in the City of Franklin in the spring of 2007. Canoe access can be found off of Rt. 619 (Burdette), Rt. 189 (S. Quay), and Rt. 620 (Broadwater Br.), but beware of vehicle parking restrictions. If you are putting in at Rt. 620 speak with landowner across the street. Colonial and later history The portion of the 1646 Treaty line running from the James River southeast to \\"Yapim\\" on the Blackwater remained the legal frontier for colonists for the next 60 years. In 1646, after two years of war between the Virginia colony and the Powhatan confederation, a peace treaty was agreed to by the leaders of the two sides (Governor William Berkeley and Chief Necotowance). The treaty set the boundary between Virginia and Indian lands at the lower Blackwater River (or Blackwater Swamp) up to its head at \\"Yapim\\" (modern Franklin), and thence in a directly straight line to the \\"Monacan town\\" (Mowhemencho, at the eastern tip of Powhatan County). Native Americans were only allowed to cross this line at the newly built Fort Henry on the Appomattox, where Petersburg now is, and they had to display a special badge, without which they could be killed on the spot, or after 1662, arrested. By the late 17th century, some settlers from Virginia were crossing the Blackwater-Ft. Henry-Monacan town boundary, and settling in territory of Indian tribes such as the Appomattoc and the Nottoway. The government of Virginia repeatedly ordered such people to return northeast of this line, and would not allow the land beyond to be surveyed for land grants. In 1685, the House of Burgesses asked Governor Howard for permission to grant some land south of the Blackwater River. The governor denied the request. According to a petition by the colonial government of Virginia made to the King, dated May 1, 1688, the Tributary Indians, who still legally owned the land west of the line, allegedly asked for settlers to move into their territory. The reason for the request was said to be fear of invasion by larger, non-Tributary tribes, in light of their own dwindling numbers, besides that \\"Such large Tracts of Land are of noe benefit nor use unto them\\".A Study of Virginia Indians and Jamestown, ch. 4 However, King William and Queen Mary wanted the moratorium on patents extended, and in 1691, another order was given demanding all settlers south of the river to return north. By 1706, the Blackwater boundary law was revoked and settlements south of the river or west of the line became legal. Transportation in early colonial Virginia was usually done by water. The many wide estuaries and wetlands made land transport difficult, especially when moving goods. Migration and settlement patterns thus tended to follow the rivers, most of which flowed from the west and emptied into Chesapeake Bay. The Blackwater River was an exception. It flowed south to Albemarle Sound. The Blackwater's headwaters were close to the main settlements along the James River (some within three miles). By the early 18th century, Virginians were living along the upper Blackwater River and using the river for travel and transportation. The political authority of Virginia was centered on Chesapeake Bay. Most of the other rivers used for travel in Virginia at the time emptied into the bay, which helped Virginia's government control the colony's affairs. The settlers using the Blackwater River, however, were drawn away from Chesapeake Bay to the relatively lawless settlements of Albemarle Bay. This played a role in the emerging \\"southside\\" society, as the region \\"south of the James River\\" became known. As early as 1713 a place called South Quay six and a half miles downriver from Franklin was becoming an important trade port. By 1777 South Quay was known as the leading interior port to the Tidewater area. Large warehouses were storing tobacco, pork and other goods for export and import. The South Quay venture eventually also became a shipyard and built two ships, the Caswell and the Washington, that helped defend the coast from the British fleet in 1777/78.Paullin, Charles Oscar (1906). The Navy of the American Revolution, p. 456. Cleveland: The Burrow Brothers Company.

London: Longman, Hurst, Rees and Orme. ending the commercial activity of what today is called Old South Quay. During the American Civil War, the Blackwater River was for a time the dividing line between Union-occupied territory and Confederate Virginia. The boundary was not well defended, allowing thousands of \\"contrabands\\" (as the slaves were called during the war) the chance to flee east out of Southampton County, across the Blackwater River and into freedom.  Flooding  Because the Blackwater River drains a large area of southern Virginia east of the Fall Line, when heavy rainfall occurs throughout the area, severe flooding occasionally occurs at several points as the large volume of water flows downstream. Critical points of such flooding have been near Zuni along U.S. Route 460, and in the independent city of Franklin, which borders Southampton County and Isle of Wight County. Unlike the marshy areas upstream, at these points the river's channel is limited, and flood stages can be reached very quickly. This occurred during Hurricane Floyd in 1999, and again in October 2006, after an unnamed Nor'-Easter storm dumped 10 inches (25 cm) of rain on the region.

It was formed in 1997. Biography Formed in 1996, the band consists of Tomy Casparri (lead vocals), Diego Castelli (bass), Juli√°n M√©ndez Morgan (guitar), Pelusa Suffloni (guitar) and Rodrigo Chaparro (drums). With a \\"sound of powerful and overwhelming rock\\" they began by playing in the local underground rock scene. They soon recorded their self-titled debut album 'MAD' which was released in 1998 and gained reasonable radio airplay having been well received by the critics. They were subsequently invited to play in several rock festivals organised by Rock and Pop FM and recorded two songs for a 4K Records CD compilation. In 2000 Mad was chosen by Eric Singer (former drummer of KISS) to support him for his KISS Exposition in Buenos Aires. In the same year they were chosen to play twice in Mar Del Plata city and also in Buenos Aires as the headlining act at a music festival organised by the national beer, Quilmes. In January 2001 Mad played to a crowd of 50,000 people in the Monsters Of Rock Festival opening for Iron Maiden, Rob Halford and Queens of the Stone Age at Jos√© Amalfitani Stadium. They also appeared in several shows at the club Cemento, widely regarded as the \\"temple of Argentine rock\\" having hosted many famous bands in Argentine rock history such as Redonditos de Ricota, Las Pelotas and A.N.I.M.A.L. The shows were excellently produced and during this time Mad were very much the \\"band of the moment\\". In mid-2001 they entered the \\"El Pie\\" recording studio to record \\"En Llamas\\" (In Flames), their second album. Produced by 4K Records/Sony Music the first single \\"Pajarito On The Rocks\\" soon became a big hit, for which a video was made. In 2004 the guitarist Nicolas Barreiro jumped into the new lineup, and the band recorded its third album \\"Segu√≠ La Flecha\\" (Follow The Arrow) produced by Adri√°n Taverna (Divididos, Attaque 77, Redonditos de Ricota, Soda Stereo, Riff, Gustavo Cerati). From this album, several radio hits were born, like \\"La Rueda\\", \\"Imperdonable\\" and \\"El Postre\\", a song for which another music video was made starring Playboy Playmate Celina Rucci. A special electric/acoustic \\"unplugged\\" style show was recorded in December 2005 and as of August 2006 is due to shortly be released as a live album. They followed this show with a performance at the Cosquin Rock Festival held by San Roque lakeside in the province of Cordoba. April 2006 was a turbulent time for the band losing 2 members. Drummer Plato Caressa left by mutual agreement on friendly terms after he felt he couldn't commit himself fully to the band. Replacement Vasco Urionag√ºena soon became accustomed to his role having acted as Plato's stand- in on previous occasions. Lead singer Tomy Caspari was suddenly ejected from the band and they have issued no official statement as to the reason for his departure. The band ceased performing for several months whilst they held auditions to find a suitable replacement for Tomy and eventually found an ideal frontman \\"El Gato\\" which initially caused some concern amongst the fans due in part to many suggesting he looks like English pop singer Robbie Williams, and would he have the hard-edged Brian Johnson style vocals that Tomy emulated? Following some intensive practice sessions and a website re- launch the band has embarked on a string of gigs throughout Argentina and the new line-up has been well received by both the media and more importantly the fans.

The company was founded in 1948 in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais by the Andrade and Gutierrez families. As of 2013, Andrade Gutierrez is the second largest construction company in Brazil with branches in 44 countries and a net income of 8 billion BRL. Andrade Gutierrez has three separate divisions: AG Engenharia (Construtora Andrade Gutierrez), which engages in engineering and construction; AG Concess√µes, which handles public projects, concessions and utilities; and AG Telecom, which provides telecommunication services. Ricardo Sera serves as president of Andrade Gutierrez. History Early history Andrade Gutierrez founded on September 2, 1948, in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, by three engineers: Gabriel and Roberto Andrade and their friend Fl√°vio Gutierrez. It began as Andrade Gutierrez S.A., a small construction company. The company constructed its first interstate engineering work, the Rio de Janeiro-Belo Horizonte highway, in the 1950s. It also participated on the construction of the Castelo Branco highway, in S√£o Paulo. Castelo Branco later became a reference of highway engineering. In the late 1950s the company benefited from the modernization plans of the president Juscelino Kubitschek, and it expanded its area of operation to different Brazil states. In the 1960s, the group built the Manaus-Porto Velho road, which spans 850 kilometers. In the 1970s, Andrade Gutierrez built the Itaipu Hydroelectric Power Plant. one of the greatest hydroelectric power plants of the world. Expansion during the 1980s In the 1980s, during the \\"lost decade\\", Andrade Gutierrez expanded its area of performance within Brazil and into the international market. The company's international expansion focused primarily on Latin America, Africa and Europe. AG built its first international road in 1987. The road spanned 120 kilometers and connected the cities Epena, Impfondo and Dongou, all of which are located in the Republic of the Congo. Andrade Gutierrez's first work in Latin America was a 150-kilometer stretch of the Chimor√©-Yapacani road in Bolivia for the Servicio Nacional de Caminos. Following Andrade Gutierrez's work in Bolivia, the company completed projects in Central America, including the Nassau International Airport in the Bahamas. In 1987, Andrade Gutierrez bought Zagope, a Portuguese company. Through its Zagope subsidiary, the company built roads, bridges and viaducts in Portugal and Mauritania. The company was also responsible for the extension of the Lisbon subway, which started in 1992. Zagope is one of the most important companies in Portugal. Andrade Gutierrez also expanded its domestic operations during the 1980s. Projects the company completed during the 1980s include the Confins International Airport located in Minas Gerais, the Lagoinha tunnel in Belo Horizonte and the canalization of the Ribeir√£o Arrudas. Andrade Gutierrez also constructed the Caraj√°s railroad, which spans 892 kilometers and connects Maranh√£o and Par√°. Diversification in the 1990s The company started to diversify its portfolio in the 1990s, when it expanded into public concessions and telecommunication. Andrade Gutierrez's industrial business unit achieved its first Brazilian engineering work, the Duque de Caxias Refinery (Reduc), and began a partnership with Petrobras. The company's first concession was with the CCR (Highway Concessions Company), which became the biggest controller of highways under concession in Latin America. Andrade Gutierrez entered the telecommunications market with the creation of AG Telecom in 1993. In 1998, the company won the auction for the privatization of Telebr√°s and integrated the operation of Telemar, which was renamed Oi in 2006. The company later founded Contax, one of the three largest contact center companies in the world. Andrade Gutierrez relocated to Argentina in 1996, where it keeps its infrastructure undertakings. Operations Andrade Gutierrez's African operations are focused on Mozambique, Angola, Nigeria, Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, Congo and Algeria. The company's Latin American operations are focused in Colombia, Peru and Venezuela. Its projects include hydroelectric power plants, thermoelectric power plants, nuclear power plants, petrochemical plants, mining, steel industry, refineries, harbors, subways, sanitation and urbanization, airports, railroads, and civil engineering. Globally, the company focuses on mining, harbors, logistic terminals, highways, and industrial plant projects (such as steel and petrochemical).  Corporate Structure  The company consists of a Board of Directors including the main company executives. Below are 5 market committees that assist the Group in making strategic decisions. Above governance, there is the Council of Shareholders, which is formed by both Andrade and Gutierrez families. Both Andrade and Gutierrez families divide the company's social capital in three equal parts, and each family has a company linked to the group.  Divisions  = Engineering and construction = In the engineering segment, AG operates in the construction of hydroelectric power plants, thermoelectric power plants, nuclear power plants, petrochemical plants, mining, steel industry, refineries, harbors, subways, sanitation and urbanization, airports, railroads, civil engineering. In July 2013, Andrade Gutierrez began constructing the Serra do Sul mine in Par√°, Brazil for the Vale mining company. The mine is planned to be the biggest in Vale's history. Vale signed three contracts with AG, a total of R$2.3 billion, for the construction of the mine, S11D, in Caraj√°s. The three contracts involve the construction of two railroad branches of 50 kilometers and a processing plant with capacity of 90 million tons of steel per year. In 2008, Andrade Gutierrez won a contract for the construction of the Jose Inacio Abreu e Lima's National Steel Company, in Piar Municipality, Bol√≠var, Venezuela. The steel plant's planned productive capacity is1.5 million tons of liquid steel per year. The same year, Andrade Gutierrez was awarded a contract for the AstiAlba Shipyard, located on the Araya Peninsula in Sucre, Venezuela. The shipyard is designed to allow PDVSA to manufacture and repair oil tankers. In 2012, Andrade Gutierrez won an additional contract to construct the Thermoelectric Plant of Cuman√°, which is also located in Sucre. The plant has a planned capacity of 760 megawatts, which will contribute to the electric power generation of the eastern region of the country. Based in Lisbon, Portugal, Zagope is responsible for Andrade Gutierrez's activities in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. With around 8000 employees, Zagope is the biggest exporter and employer of the construction sector in Portugal, ranked 3rd largest construction company and 4th largest company in Portugal. The subsidiary's volume of business went from ‚Ç¨160 million in 2004 to ‚Ç¨506 million in 2011. Reaching the number of about 5.000 employees, in late 2014, Zagope became Andrade Gutierrez Europe, Africa, Asia. The change intended to endorse their position as a global and unified group also in the European, African and Asian markets. The company, which is present in over 12 countries, was responsible for the expansion of the runway at Funchal Airport in Madeira Islands. In Algeria, the AG Europe, Africa, Asia is responsible for the Viaduct Transrhumel in the city of Constantine, considered one of the country's largest transport projects. In Angola, AG EAA is involved with infrastructure services in the provinces of Hu√≠la, Luanda and Cubango. =AG Concessions= Created in 1999, AG Concessions is a sub-holding of the Andrade Gutierrez group. The division was founded following Andrade Gutierrez's experiences with public service concessions throughout the 1990s. AG Concessions operates both domestically and internationally and focuses on infrastructure concessions. The division operates in the transport and logistics areas via CCR; energy with Cemig and Santo Ant√¥nio Energia; sanitation through Sanepar; telecommunication via Oi and Contax; health with Logimed and Novo Metropolitano (Barreiro's Metropolitan Hospital), in Belo Horizonte; and sports arenas via Brio, which is responsible for the modernization of Beira- Rio Stadium. In 2012, AG Concessions had a gross operating revenue of R$5.146. AG Concessions takes part in the administration of many Brazilian roads, including Rodovia Presidente Dutra, Rodovia Anhanguera and Rodovia Castelo Branco. =AG Private E&C;= In 2012, the Andrade Gutierrez group restructured itself internally and created AG Private E&C;, a specific division to take care of the provision of service contracts for private initiatives. In the same year, the contracts yielded earnings of R$300 million. In 2013, AG Private E&C; reached R$2.3 billion with the signing of Vale's S11D contract mining contract in Caraj√°s. The president of AG Private E&C; is Ricardo S√°. AG Private E&C; focuses mainly in multinational corporations, but also shows interest in mining projects, ports & harbors, food & beverages, logistics terminals, roads, industrial plants and high-tech infrastructure. =Energy generation= Andrade Gutierrez entered the energy sector with the Santo Ant√¥nio Energia consortium. The consortium is responsible for the construction and operation of the Santo Ant√¥nio Hydroelectric Plant, located at Madeira river, in Rond√¥nia. It's also responsible for the commercialization of the generated energy. The hydroelectric plant of Santo Ant√¥nio is a result of the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC) of the federal government, and consists of 50 turbine generators with a total capacity of 3,568 MW of power generation. In 2014, Cemig GT increased by 10% its stakes in Santo Ant√¥nio Energia after acquiring 83% of the total capital and 49% of the shares of SAAG Investmentos, managed by Andrade Gutierrez Participa√ß√µes. The structure of the transaction took place through participation investment funds, such as the FIP Melbourne, in which Cemig GT ‚Äì along with pension funds ‚Äì invests. The acquisition price was 835.3 million BRL. The participation of Cemig in Santo Ant√¥nio Energia increased to 18.05%. In 2010, Andrade Gutierrez became the owner of 33% of the voting capital of CEMIG, a state-owned company that is chaired by Djalma Bastos de Morais. AGC Energy, subsidiary company of AG, took on the debt of Southern Electric Brasil (SEB), owner of the shares, for R$2.1 billion. From the total, R$500 million was paid in cash. =Basic Sanitation= The AG Concess√µes started in the basic sanitation sector through the Domino Holdings. They joined as a shareholder of the Paran√° Sanitation Company (Sanepar), and later on, in Water Port, which operates in the water and sewage system in the Port of Santos. In April 2014, AG terminated the Water Port contract with the Society of S√£o Paulo State Dock (Codesp). =Telecommunications= In 1993, AG created AG Telecom and in July 1998, the company bought, via the Telemar consortium, Oi. In 2008, Oi bought Brasil Telecom. AG Telecom's business portfolio includes Oi, Oi Internet, Way Brasil (regional paid TV operator) and Contax.

It was directed and produced by Prakash Jha and stars Madhuri Dixit, Shabana Azmi, Ayub Khan, Mohan Agashe and Om Puri. The film is a commentary on the social and the gender injustice.Hip Hip Hurray to Aarakshan: The best of director Prakash Jha As in his other movies, filmmaker Prakash Jha has focussed on the social problems that plague his native state of Bihar, India, and like his other movies this one straddles the boundary between art film and commercial film. The film also boasted of some semi-classical music, tuned by Anand-Milind and Raghunath Seth and worded by Javed Akhtar. The film was critically acclaimed and is considered to be one of Madhuri Dixit's best performances. Synopsis It is set in the village of Bilaspur, Bihar in 1996. The movie starts with the grisly portrayal of a mob killing of two defenceless women, orchestrated by vested interests, and how village power players later evade administrative inquiries into this atrocity. This incident sets the tone for much of the rest of the movie. The central characters are a young couple, Vinay (Ayub Khan) and Ketki (Madhuri Dixit). They are quickly plunged into the midst of machinations by several powerful and unscrupulous villagers. Foremost among them is contractor Tirpat Singh (Mohan Joshi), a powerful, corrupt and ruthless man who oppresses poor people and especially women with impunity. Vinay too becomes influenced by Tirpat, and under this influence spirals down a dark road of domestic abuse, alcoholism, and selfishness that alienates his loving wife and tears apart the whole family, despite her best efforts to fight this. The rest of the movie deals with their efforts to break out of this morass, both within their relationship as well as outside of it, and Vinay's and especially Ketki's long, hard, and bloody struggle to confront and defeat the forces of oppression and male domination in the village.Women to the fore Cast * Madhuri Dixit as Ketki Singh * Shabana Azmi as Chandravati * Ayub Khan as Vinay Singh * Om Puri as Rambaran Mahto * Shilpa Shirodkar as Kanti * Mohan Joshi as Tirpat Singh * Mohan Agashe as Abhay Singh * Harish Patel as MLA Durga Pandey * Brij Gopal * Abha Dhulia * Suhas Bhalekar * Achyut Potdar as Ketki's father (Special Appearance) * Mona Ambegaonkar in a Special Appearance * Raj Kamal * Surendra Sathi * Sudhir Mishra * Vinod Kumar * Hemanth Gadkar * Pinky Chinoy * John Phanse * Rohit Raj * Vicky Ahuja * Indu Shivraj Soundtrack #\\"Keh Do Ek Bar Sajana Itna Kyu Pyar Sajna\\" - Udit Narayan, Alka Yagnik #\\"Raat Maheke To Yun Bhi Hota Hai Chand\\" - Sadhana Sargam, Hariharan #\\"Itani Hai Mori Kahani Ke Raja Mai To Ho Gayi Tori Diwani\\" - Sadhana Sargam #\\"Kab Se Main Hun Khadi Beech Dhare, Dur Nadiya Ke\\" - Sadhana Sargam #\\"Tum Bin Man Ki Bat Adhuri, Din Hai Adhure\\" - Kumar Sanu, Sadhana Sargam Awards *Special Jury Award, Best Feature Film, Cin√©ma Tout Ecran, Geneva (1998) *Audience Award, Best Feature Film, Bangkok Film Festival (1998) *Best Actress, Madhuri Dixit, Screen Awards (1998) *Best Supporting Actress, Shabana Azmi, Screen Awards (1998) *Best Actor In A Negative Role, Mohan Joshi, Screen Awards (1998) *Best Director, Prakash Jha, Zee Cine Awards (1998) *Best Dialogue Writer, Prakash Jha, Zee Cine Awards (1998) *Best Sound (Re-recording), Zee Cine Awards (1998) *Best Feature Film (Critics' Choice), Prakash Jha, Sansui Awards (1998) *Best Actress, Madhuri Dixit, Sansui Awards (1998) Reception Anupama Chopra of India Today wrote \\"Mrityudand is not a great film but it is a good one. It can't match the power of a Thelma & Louise or Mirch Masala but it packs a solid wallop. And in these dumb and dumber times, it is a refreshing change.\\" The reviewer for Screen called the film \\"a superbly crafted web of intrigue that gets darker and murkier till it reaches horrifying proportions of cruelty and ferociousness\\" and that it is \\"passionate, highly articulate, and never confused.\\" They felt that the film \\"questions the limited definition of woman merely as a wife or a mother, and goes on to show strong women who define themselves as individuals.\\" Commending the acting performances, the reviewer wrote, \\"While Madhuri is her usual fiery self, Shabana fits perfectly into the role of a woman who chooses to rejuvenate her life ... Mohan Joshi and Mohan Agashe are as detestable and evil as could be. But the greatest surprise of the film is Ayub Khan. He has had the rare opportunity to prove his mettle opposite veteran actresses Madhuri and Shabana, and he has held his own admirably. He is dashing and full of passion, and no way does he seem a novice when it comes to romancing the beautiful Dixit.\\" They concluded writing, \\"Prakash Jha deserves a pat for the manner in which he treated the film ... Here is a film which not only has something to say, but says it well. There are no hysterical histrionics. There is no hypocricy and false rhetoric which one finds so often in films which profess to be socially progressive for women. The songs are situational and elegant.\\" Mrityudand was invited for the gala premiere at BFI London Film Festival in 1997. The film was also received well by audiences upon theatrical release. 75 per cent collection were reported on the first day of release. It was declared tax-free in theatres of Mumbai.

Architectural works with a certain indefinable combination of design quality and external circumstances may become cultural symbols and / or be considered works of art.  What type of thing is architecture?  Architecture can be described as all of the following: * Academic discipline - focused study in one academic field or profession. A discipline incorporates expertise, people, projects, communities, challenges, studies, inquiry, and research areas that are strongly associated with the given discipline. * Buildings - buildings and similar structures, the product of architecture, are referred to as architecture. * One of the arts - as an art form, architecture is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. Architecture is a physical manifestation of the internal human creative impulse. ** Fine art - in Western European academic traditions, fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics, distinguishing it from applied art that also has to serve some practical function. The word \\"fine\\" here does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons. * Science - systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.A science is a branch of science, or a discipline of science. It's a way of pursuing knowledge, not only the knowledge itself. ** Applied science - branch of science that applies existing scientific knowledge to develop more practical applications, such as technology or inventions. Definitions of architecture Architecture is variously defined in conflicting ways, highlighting the difficulty of describing the scope of the subject precisely: * A general term to describe buildings and other physical structures - although not all buildings are generally considered to be architecture, and infrastructure (bridges, roads etc.) is civil engineering, not architecture. * The art and science, or the action and process, of designing and constructing buildings. * The design activity of the architect, the profession of designing buildings. * A building designed by an architect, the end product of architectural design. * A building whose design transcends mere function, a unifying or coherent form or structure. * The expression of thought in building. * A group or body of buildings in a particular style. * A particular style or way of designing buildings. Some key quotations on the subject of architecture: * Vitruvius: defined the essential qualities of architecture as \\"firmness, commodity and delight\\". * Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: \\"I call architecture frozen music\\". * Walter Gropius: \\"Architecture begins where engineering ends\\". * Le Corbusier: \\"A house is a machine for living in\\". * Louis Sullivan: \\"... form ever follows function. This is the law\\", usually quoted as the architectural mantra \\"form follows function\\". * Mies van der Rohe: \\"Less is more\\". * Robert Venturi: \\"Less is a bore\\".  Roles in architecture  Professionals involved in planning, designing, and constructing buildings include: * Architect ‚Äì a person trained in the planning, design and supervision of building construction. ** Architectural intern ‚Äì a person gaining practical experience while studying to qualify as an architect. ** Council architect ‚Äì an architect employed by a local authority. ** Landscape architect ‚Äì a person who develops land for human use and enjoyment through effective placement of structures, vehicular and pedestrian ways, and plantings. ** Project architect ‚Äì a person who is responsible for overseeing the architectural aspects of the development of the design, production of the construction documents and specifications. ** State architect ‚Äì a person who is generally responsible for the design and/or construction of public buildings in the state. * Architectural designer ‚Äì generally, a designer involved in architecture but not qualified as an architect. * Architectural engineer * Architectural technologist or building technologist ‚Äì a professional trained in architectural technology, building design and construction, and who provides building design services. * Building control officer or Approved Inspector * Building inspector * Clerk of works * Drafter or draughtsman ‚Äì a person trained in drawing up architectural drawings. * Site manager * Building surveyor  People engaged in architecture  * List of architects * List of architecture firms * List of architectural historians * Architecture critics Architectural styles Architectural style - a specific way of building, characterized by the features that make it notable. A style may include such elements as form, method of construction, materials, and regional character. Influential contemporary and relatively recent styles include : * Modern architecture - generally characterized by simplification of form and the absence of applied ornament. * Postmodern architecture - has been described as the return of \\"wit, ornament and reference\\" to architecture in response to the formalism of the International Style of modernism. * Deconstructivism - based on the more general theory of deconstruction, a design style characterized by fragmentation, distortion and dislocation of structure and envelope. * International style or international modern- the pervasive and often anonymous style of city developments worldwide. * Brutalism - the notorious use of raw concrete and massive uncompromising forms.  Specialist subclassifications of architecture  Terms used to describe different architectural concerns, origins and objectives. * Architecture parlante (\\"speaking architecture\\") - buildings or architectural elements that explain their own function or identity by means of an inscription or literal representation. * Religious architecture - the design and construction of places of worship. * Responsive architecture - designing buildings that measure their environmental conditions (via sensors) to adapt their form, shape, color or character responsively (via actuators). * Sustainable architecture - environmentally conscious design techniques in the field of architecture. * Vernacular architecture - traditional local building styles, typically not designed by professional architects although vernacular elements are adopted by many architects.  Architectural theory  * Architectural design values - the various values that influence architects and designers in making design decisions. * Mathematics and architecture - have always been close, because architecture relies upon mathematical precision, and because both fields share a search for order and beauty. * Pattern language - a term coined by architect Christopher Alexander, a structured method of describing good design practices within a field of expertise. * Proportion - the relationship between elements and the whole. * Space syntax - a set of theories and techniques for the analysis of spatial configurations. * Architecture criticism - published or broadcast critique, assessing the architect's success in meeting his own aims and objectives and those of others.

Although now historical, the ubiquitous international style which predominates in cities worldwide remains a strong influence in contemporary architecture. * Postmodern architecture - began as an international style the first examples of which are generally cited as being from the 1950s, but did not become a movement until the late 1970s and continues to influence present-day architecture. * New Classical architecture - a movement for reapproaching traditional architecture language, that established since the 1980s. * Contemporary architecture - the architecture of the 21st century.  Buildings  Although not all buildings are architecture, the term encompasses a huge range of building types, as summarised in the following list pages: * List of building types * List of buildings and structures * List of human habitation forms Building construction * Building design Materials * Materiality (architecture) * Building material * List of building materials Structural elements :Refer to:  Architectural elements * Arch - a curved structure, often made up blocks or bricks, spanning across an opening and supporting the weight of structure above. Works by transferring vertical loads into compression forces. There are many arch shapes including semicircular, segmental, parabolic, pointed (gothic), three-point and flat arches. * Beam (structure) - a straight structural member, typically wood or steel, capable of spanning from one support to another and supporting the weight of structure above. Works by resisting bending forces. * Buttress - a short section of masonry built at right angles to a wall, to resist lateral forces. * Cantilever - a projecting structure without visible means of support at the projecting end. * Column or pillar - a relatively slender structural element, typically circular, square or polygonal in plan, that bears the weight of the structure above. * Dome - a roof structure, typically hemispherical, constructed in a similar way to an arch. The plan shape may be circular, elliptical or polygonal, and the cross section shape can vary in the same ways as an arch. * Doorway - opening in a wall, typically rectangular, providing means of access, usually with a gate or door to provide security and weather protection. * Facade - an exterior face of a building, especially the front. * Foundation or footing - solid base usually below ground, upon which buildings and other structures are built. Works by spreading vertical loads over a sufficient area to ensure the structure will not subside. * Lintel - a structural member spanning across the top of an opening. Unlike a beam, a lintel spans a relatively short distance which can be spanned by single block of stone of sufficient depth. Concrete, timber and steel lintels are also used in different types of construction. * Pier (architecture) - loadbearing structure similar to a column, but more massive. * Truss - a structure spanning in the same way as a beam, but using materials more efficiently by using triangulation to create a rigid structure. Typically timber or steel, used to support a pitched roof. * Vault (architecture) - a curved masonry structure spanning in the same way as an arch, forming either a roof or support for a floor above. * Wall - a linear structure enclosing the exterior of an area or building, or subdividing an internal space. A wall may be loadbearing or non-loadbearing. * Window - an opening in a wall, typically rectangular, providing light and ventilation. Usually but not always glazed. Architectural education Professional requirements for architects - Students undertake specific vocational training in order to qualify as a professional architects. Training typically consists of one or more university degrees and a period of practical experience. In some countries, it is illegal to use the title architect without accredited qualifications. In the United Kingdom the Architects Registration Board exists solely to regulate membership of the profession, and the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards is an umbrella organisation covering all the organisations fulfilling a similar role in the United States. Architectural education can involve degree types that do not directly result in licensing, such as Bachelor of Science in Architecture, Bachelor of Arts in Architecture, or a research PhD in Architecture. Some of the qualifications specific to architectural licensing include: * Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) - undergraduate academic degree designed to satisfy the academic component of professional accreditation bodies, to be followed by a period of practical training prior to professional examination and registration. * Master of Architecture (M.Arch.) - professional degree in architecture, qualifying the graduate to move through the various stages of professional accreditation (internship, exams) that result in receiving a license. * Doctor of Architecture (D.Arch) - doctoral degree in the field of architecture, that can be completed after either a Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch), Master of Architecture (M.Arch) degree or, in some cases, another degree.  Architectural practice  * Architectural drawing or architect's drawing - a technical drawing of a building or building project. * Architectural design competition - a specialist competition inviting architects to submit design proposals for a project. * Architectural technology or building technology - is the application of technology to the design of buildings. It is a component of architecture and building engineering and is sometimes viewed as a distinct discipline or sub-category. * Blueprint - an obsolete paper-based method of reproducing technical drawings producing a distinctive appearance, white lines on a blue background. The word is still in use as a by-word for a design solution (\\"a blueprint for future developments\\"). * Brief (architecture) - a written statement of a client's requirements for a building project. * Building code or building control - a set of rules that specify the minimum acceptable level of safety and environmental performance in building construction. *Computer-aided architectural design (CAAD) - software based production of technical drawings and 3-d models *Construction law - a branch of law that deals with matters relating to building construction. * Cost accounting or cost management - a vital activity in connection with building, generally performed by a specialist quantity surveyor. Construction projects are notoriously subject to cost overruns, caused by changing circumstances or by failure to fully allow for foreseeable costs during budgeting. * Project management - the process of managing all the activities involved in a construction project, including adherence to the design and local legislation, costs and payment, and verification of project completion. Architecture prizes Architecture prize - Architecture prizes are generally awarded for completed projects and are chosen from publicised or nominated works, not from submissions by the originating architect. The RIBA Royal Gold Medal has in fact been refused on a number of occasions. * Aga Khan Award for Architecture (AKAA) - an architectural prize established by Aga Khan IV in 1977, awarded for achievements in design and planning in Islamic societies. * AIA Gold Medal - awarded by the American Institute of Architects for a significant body of work 'of lasting influence on the theory and practice of architecture', first awarded 1907. * European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture, also known as the Mies van der Rohe Award - awarded jointly by the European Union and the Fundacia Mies van der Rohe, Barcelona, 'to acknowledge and reward quality architectural production in Europe'. * Pritzker Architecture Prize - awarded annually to \\"a living architect whose built work demonstrates a combination of those qualities of talent, vision and commitment, which has produced consistent and significant contributions to humanity and the built environment through the art of architecture\\". Founded in 1979 by Jay A. Pritzker and his wife Cindy, the award is often referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture. * RIBA Royal Gold Medal - awarded annually since 1848 by the Royal Institute of British Architects for an individual's or group's substantial contribution to international architecture. It is given for a distinguished body of work rather than for one building. * Carbuncle Cup - unlike the mainstream awards which reward perceived merit, this is awarded annually by the UK magazine Building Design to 'the ugliest building in the United Kingdom completed in the last 12 months'. more...  Related fields  * Architectural conservation - repair and restoration of buildings, especially historic structures. * Architectural technology - the application of technology to the design of buildings. * Construction - the process of creating physical structures. * Building construction - construction specific to buildings. * Civil engineering - the design, construction and maintenance of the physical environment e.g. bridges, canals, dams, drainage systems and roads etc. * Building services engineering - the design of heating, ventilation and cooling and other mechanical systems, electrical power and lighting. * Structural engineering - the analysis and design of structures that support or resist loads. * Sustainable design - provides expertise in improving the environmental performance of buildings. * Interior design - the design of interior finishes and fittings. * Urban design, Urban planning (urban, city, and town planning) - a technical and legal process concerned with controlling the design of structures and the use of land.

Roy Thinnes played the title role of Dr. James Whitman. Luther Adler co-starred as Dr. Bernard Altman, the older psychiatrist with whom Whitman worked. Two episodes of the short-lived series, \\"The Private World of Martin Dalton\\" and \\"Par for the Course,\\" were directed by Steven Spielberg. The regular hour-long series ran from February 3, 1971, to March 10 of the same year. The pilot for the series, a made-for-TV movie called The Psychiatrist: God Bless the Children, aired on December 14, 1970. Actor Pete Duel was at the center of this 90 minute drama, as Casey Poe, a former drug addict who, after finishing a two-year prison sentence, must battle his own personal demons, as well as the prejudices of others, in order to reenter society. Dr. Whitman is the psychiatrist who must break through Poe's resistance in order to help him form a new life for himself. Duel received much praise for his performance and reprised his role in the first regular episode of the series, \\"In Death's Other Kingdom.\\" The Psychiatrist was an element in the wheel series Four in One, which NBC aired in the 10 PM Eastern time slot during its 1970-71 series. The Psychiatrist was the final series of the four to air, following the first-run conclusions of the other three components, McCloud, Night Gallery, and San Francisco International Airport. After all four series had completed their initial six-episode runs, reruns of the four were interspersed with each other until the end of the summer. Of the four elements, McCloud was picked up as one element of a new wheel-format series, the NBC Mystery Movie, and Night Gallery was picked up as a stand-alone series, while San Francisco International Airport and The Psychiatrist were cancelled with no further episodes ordered beyond the original six.

State - 78% Special education In December 2012, the district administration reported that 244 pupils, or 21.9% of the district's pupils, received special education services, with 44.3% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2010, the district administration reported that 262 pupils, or 21% of the district's pupils, received special education services. Of these students, 51% had a specific learning disability. In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the district's Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 The West Branch Area School District received a $707,881 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì2012, 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010‚Äì2011. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. Gifted education The District Administration reported that 17 or 1.30% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Teacher evaluation study In 2011, West Branch Area School District agreed to participate in a pilot program to develop a new way to evaluate public school teachers and principals that, in part, takes into account student achievement. Several York County school districts are participating. The pilot program had 104 K-12 entities, including: nine career and technical centers, nine charter schools and nine intermediate units. Beginning in January 2012, participating school districts will use the new evaluation method and provide feedback to the Department of Education. This new evaluation was not used to determine an educator's official 2011-12 assessment. Under the new evaluation system, 50% of the evaluation of a teacher will be based on an observation divided into four categories: planning and preparation, classroom environment, instruction, and professional responsibilities. The other half will be based on student achievement (15 percent will be building-level data, 15 percent will be teacher-specific data, and 20 percent will be elective). The new evaluation system has both announced and unannounced observations. There are meetings between the teacher and evaluator before and after the direct observation of a lesson.Mason, Angie., Educators: New teacher evaluation system is a lot of talk -- but so far that's good, \\"The York Daily Record, April 29, 2012 Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE).

Tuition Students who live in the district's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to West Branch Area School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the district's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are Elementary School - $10,209.96, High School - $9,758.78.

Real estate taxes Property tax rates in 2014-15 were set by the West Branch Area School Board at: 97.00 mills for district residents in Clearfield County and 10.90 mills for district residents in Clinton County.West Branch Area School Board Secretary, Meeting Minutes May 2014, May 19, 2014 A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Clinton County conducted a reassessment in 2008. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service-related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75 and 85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. The school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, necessitating a state board equalization of the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the board were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts. *2013-14 - 94.1000 mills for Clearfield County and 9.8000 mills for Clinton County. *2012-13 - 93.0000 mills for Clearfield County and 9.0000 mills for Clinton County.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates 2012-13, 2012 *2011-12 - 91.4000 mills for Clearfield County and 8.0000 mills for Clinton County. *2010-11 - 91.4000 mills for Clearfield County and 5.7700 mills for Clinton County. *2009-10 - 90.4000 mills for Clearfield County and 8.7000 mills for Clinton County. *2008-09 - 90.4000 mills for Clearfield County and 71.8000 mills for Clinton County. *2007-08 - 88.4000 mills for Clearfield County and 67.4500 mills for Clinton County.

Clearfield County ranked 707th out of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax-rates.org., The 2013 Tax Resource County Property Taxes 2012, 2012 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999‚Äì00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010-11, 2011 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. =Act 1 Adjusted Index= The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. The following exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. A specific timeline for Act I Index decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The School District Adjusted Index for the West Branch Area School District 2006-2007 through 2011‚Äì2012. *2006-07 - 5.8%, Base 3.9% *2007-08 - 5.1%, Base 3.4% *2008-09 - 6.6%, Base 4.4% *2009-10 - 6.2%, Base 4.1% *2010-11 - 4.4%, Base 2.9% *2011-12 - 2.1%, Base 1.4% *2012-13 - 2.6%, Base 1.7% *2013-14 - 2.6%, Base 1.7% Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2013-2014 School District Adjusted Index, September 2012 *2014-15 - 3.1%, Base 2.1% Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2014-2015 School District Adjusted Index, September 2013 For the 2014-2015 budget year, West Branch Area School Board applied for two exceptions to exceed their Act 1 Index limit: teacher pension costs and special education costs.

For the pension costs exception, 163 school districts received approval to exceed the Index in full, while others received a partial approval of their request. For special education costs, 104 districts received approval to exceed their tax limit. Seven Pennsylvania public school districts received an approval for the grandfathered construction debts exception. For the 2013-2014 budget year, West Branch Area School Board applied for three exceptions to exceed their Act 1 Index limit: teacher pension costs, special education costs and School Construction Grandfathered Debt.

For the school budget year 2013‚Äì14, 311 Pennsylvania public school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index. Another 171 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the pension costs exception, 169 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 75 districts received approval to exceed their tax limit. Eleven Pennsylvania public school districts received an approval for grandfathered construction debts.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2013-2014, April 2013 For the 2012-13 budget year, West Branch Area School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. In 2012‚Äì13, all Pennsylvania school districts were required to make a 12.36% of payroll payment to the teacher's pension fund (PSERS). For 2012-2013 budget year, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; while 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011‚Äì2012 school year, West Branch Area School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the school board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. The West Branch Area School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2011. For 2009-10 school budget, the board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Index. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. =Property tax relief= In 2010, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the West Branch Area School District was not reported to the Commonwealth. The gaming fund provided the district with $282,652.85 for property tax relief. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. The highest property tax relief in Pennsylvania went to the residents of Chester Upland School District of Delaware County who received $632 per approved homestead.Tax Relief per Homestead 2009, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report May 1, 2010 Chester Upland has been the top recipient every year of the program. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently, individual with income much more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Wellness policy West Branch Area School Board established a district-wide Student Wellness Policy in October 2011. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. West Branch Area School District offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low-income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non- subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. West Branch Area School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. A nurse is available in the building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. Highmark Healthy Grant In 2009, the West Branch Area School District received funding through a Highmark Healthy High 5 grant. West Branch Area Elementary School received $8,689 which was used to purchase DDR system, climbing wall and nutrition curriculum for students in grades 1‚Äì6.Highmark Foundation, 2009 School Challenge Grants, 2009 In 2014, West Branch Area School District received $5000 to fund the SPARK Physical education curriculum.Highmark Foundation, 2014 Highmark Foundation grants report, 2014 Beginning in 2006, Highmark Foundation engaged in a 5-year, $100 million program to promote lifelong healthy behaviors in children and adolescents through local nonprofits and schools. Enrollment According to Pennsylvania Department of Education enrollment reports, there were 1,245 students enrolled in K-12 in 2009‚Äì2010 school year at West Branch Area School District. There were 106 students in the Class of 2009. The district's class of 2010 had 90 students. Enrollment is projected to decline to 796 students by 2020. A study of Pennsylvania public school spending, conducted by Standard and Poor's, examined the consolidation of small public school districts in Pennsylvania in 2007. The study found that consolidation of the administration with an adjacent school district would achieve substantial administrative cost savings which varied by district. According to a 2009 school district administration consolidation proposal by Governor Edward Rendell, the excessive administrative overhead dollars could be redirected to improve lagging academic achievement, to enrich the academic programs or to reduce property taxes. Consolidation of two central administrations into one would not require the closing of any schools. The Governor's proposal called for the savings to be redirected to improving lagging reading and science achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing residents' property taxes. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants Fiscal Responsibility Task Force released a report which found that consolidating school district administrations with one neighboring district would save the Commonwealth $1.2 billion without forcing the consolidation of any schools. From 2000 through 2010, rural Pennsylvania public school district enrollment has decreased by 8 percent. In 2010, there were 726,417 children in rural Pennsylvania, or 21 percent of the total rural population. From 2000 to 2010, the number of children in rural counties decreased 7 percent. The decline in the number of children impacted most rural counties with 42 of Pennsylvania's 48 rural counties experiencing a decline. Cameron County, Elk County and Sullivan County experienced the greatest declines, with a decrease of more than 21 percent in all three counties. Clearfield County's live birth rate was 944 births in 1990. Clearfield County's live birth rate in 2000 declined to 819 births, while in 2011 it had declined further to 749 babies.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Birth Age County Reports 1990 and 2011, 2011 Over the past 50 years (1960 to 2010), rural Pennsylvania saw a steady decline in both the number and proportion of residents under 18 years old. In 1960, 1.06 million rural residents, or 35 percent of the rural population, were children. Pennsylvania's birth rate has been declining for two decades. According to data from the Pennsylvania Department of Health, in 1990, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's birth rate was 171,053.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Health Statistics - Resident Live Birth rate by county, 1990 In 2000, Pennsylvania's birth rate was 145,874.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Health Statistics - Resident Live Birth rate by county, 2000 Finally in 2011, the State's birth rate declined further to 142,021.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Health Statistics - Resident Live Birth rate by county, 2013 From 2000 to 2009, the number of babies born in rural counties declined 5 percent.Center for Rural Pennsylvania, Number of Children Decreasing, Number of Seniors Increasing in Rural Pennsylvania, July 2011 Urban counties have also experienced a decline in the number of school aged children. From 2000 to 2010 urban Pennsylvania counties had a 3 percent decline in the number of residents under 18 years old. In 2010, there were 2.07 million residents, or 22 percent of the urban population, who were under age 18.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Birth Statistics, 2013 Extracurriculars West Branch Area School District offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). The district is noncompliant with state law, due to failing to post its Interscholastic Athletic Opportunities Disclosure Form on its website. In 2014‚Äì15, the district reported spending $450,666 for extracurriculars.Jason McMillian West Branch Area School District Administration, West Branch Area School District Budget report 2014-2015, January 2014 A new baseball field was built, but leased to a local little league team for 25 years which expires in 2036. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. Marching band The West Branch band also has a shining history, as they've played in such cities as Philadelphia, Washington, DC, and Harrisburg. Most recently, the band goes to Disney World bi-yearly to play in the Fourth of July parade. The band wins many awards and helps to uphold the proud traditions and history of West Branch High School. In 2008, the former band director and creator of many of the school's traditions, Mr. William Gabel, retired. He was replaced by former elementary music teacher and West Branch alumna, Mrs. Jennifer Ennis Sproull. Athletics West Branch's mascot is the Warrior. Their team motos are \\"Warrior Power\\" and \\"Warrior Pride\\". They participate in the PIAA District 6 with Single-A classification in all but wrestling and baseball, where they compete in Double-A. Noteworthy athletic achievements include five PIAA individual state champions in wrestling (Jerry White, Robert English, Justin Owens, Jared Ricotta & Reynold 'Buzzy' Maines), winning a district championship in football in 1988, a district championship in baseball, a team district duals championship in wrestling, and other various conference championships. Former Warrior baseball players Ed Veres and John Prestash were selected in the Major League Baseball Draft straight out of high school. Larry Beightol, a former football player at West Branch, is an offensive line coach in the NFL, most recently working with the Detroit Lions. Wrestling State Champion Jared Ricotta, after starting four years for the Duquesne Dukes Division I Wrestling Team and capturing three Northeast Regional Titles was recruited by NASCAR's Hendrick Motorsports as a professional tire changer. Starting in Fall 2010, West Branch and local school Philipsburg-Osceola School District agreed to a co-op boys soccer program. Any 9-12th grade boy wishing to play soccer now plays with the Philipsburg Soccer team. According to Pennsylvania's Safety in Youth Sports Act, all sports coaches, paid and volunteer, are required to annually complete the Concussion Management Certification Training and present the certification before coaching. Coaches receive compensation as outlined in the teachers' union contract. When athletic competition exceeds the regular season, additional compensation is paid.West Branch Area School Board, West Branch Area School District Teacher Union Contract, 2014 ;The district funds: ;Varsity: ;Boys: *Baseball - AA *Basketball- AA *Cross Country - A *Football - A *Soccer - AA *Track and Field - AA *Wrestling - AA ;Girls: *Basketball - A *Cross Country - A *Soccer (Fall) - A *Softball - A *Track and Field - AA *Volleyball - A ;Junior High Middle School Sports: ;Boys: *Basketball *Football *Wrestling ;Girls: *Basketball *Softball According to PIAA directory July 2013 References External links * School districts in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania Clearfield County, Pennsylvania Education in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania School districts in Clinton County, Pennsylvania Education in Clinton County, Pennsylvania Clinton County, Pennsylvania ","title":"West Branch Area School District"},{"id":"6386973","text":"RSHS may refer to: ;schools in Australia *Redcliffe State High School, Redcliffe, Queensland *Rossmoyne Senior High School, Rossmoyne, Western Australia ;schools in Canada *Ross Sheppard High School, Edmonton, Alberta ;schools in the United States *John G.

The origin and nature of the green color of this worm stimulated the curiosity of zoologists early on. It is due to the partnership between the animal and a green micro-algae, the species Tetraselmis convolutae, hosted under its epidermis. It is the photosynthetic activity of the micro-algae in hospite that provides the essential nutrients for the worm. This partnership is called photosymbiosis, from \\"photo\\", \\"light\\", and symbiosis \\"who lives with\\". These photosynthetic marine animals live in colonies (up to several million individuals) on the tidal zone.  Biology and ecology of the species Symsagittifera roscoffensis  Although roscoffensis means \\"who comes from Roscoff\\", this flatworm is not endemic to Roscoff or North Brittany. Its geographical distribution extends over the Atlantic coast of Europe; colonies were observed from Wales to the south of Portugal.  130 years of history  Symsagittifera roscoffensis, the \\"Roscoff worm\\" In 1879, at the Station Biologique de Roscoff founded by Henri de Lacaze-Duthiers, the British biologist Patrick Geddes pondered the nature and origin of the green compound of a local acoela he called Convoluta schultzii. He succinctly described \\"chlorophyll-containing cells\\" and the presence of associated starch \\"as in plant chlorophyll grains\\". In 1886, French biologist Yves Delage published a detailed histological study describing (among other things) the nervous system and the sense organs of the same Roscoff acoela, Convoluta schultzii. In this article Delage also inquired as to \\"the nature of zoochlorella (i.e. micro-algae): are they real algae? Where do they come from? What are the symbiotic relationships that unite them to their commensal?\\" In 1891, Ludwig von Graff, a German zoologist from the University of Graz and a specialist in acoela, undertook a taxonomic redescription of the Roscoff acoela at the Station Biologique de Roscoff. His works highlight a taxonomic confusion in the previous works of Geddes and Delage: \\"... the researches made in Roscoff and on the Adriatic coasts showed me that the green convoluta of the Adriatic (Convoluta schultzii) ... is specifically different from the green Convoluta of Roscoff. I have preserved for the first one the old name Convoluta schultzii, for the second I give the name of Convoluta roscoffensis.\\" The species name roscoffensis is thus a tribute to the Station Biologique de Roscoff and Henri de Lacaze-Duthiers. In this article, von Graff also writes about zoochlorella (i.e. micro-algae) \\"Although they undoubtedly derive from algae ... they represent however, in their current state of adaptation, a specific tissue of the worm dedicated to assimilation\\". First cover of the book published in 1912 by Keeble on the biology of the partnership Convoluta roscoffensis and its micro-algae It is in an academic book entitled Plant-Animals published in 1912 by Frederick Keeble, the co- discoverer of the nature and the origin of micro-algae, where a set of works is describing the specific relationship between Convoluta roscoffensis and its photosynthetic partners. Luigi Provasoli, a pioneering micro-algologist in the art of isolating and cultivating micro-algae, maintained for several years between 1965 and 1967 in New York (Haskins Laboratories, now in Connecticut) generations of S. roscoffensis directly received from the Station Biologique de Roscoff. Thus generations of non-symbiotic juveniles were born in New York and were used to test the specificity of association between S. roscoffensis and different species of micro-algae. A century after its formal description, in 1991, thanks to the techniques of molecular biology and the emerging tools of bioinformatics, the phylogeny of acoela was revisited and modified: the green Convoluta of Roscoff, Convoluta roscoffensis became Symsagittifera roscoffensis, the \\"Roscoff worm\\". = Biotope and ethology = Symsagittifera roscoffensis lives in the tidal balancing zone, preferentially in a sandy substrate, poor in organic matter. The accumulation of the latter generates reduced, hypoxic or anoxic conditions, which promote the development of anaerobic bacteria releasing compounds such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) incompatible with the oxygen requirements of the worm. Circatidal rhythms (dynamic alternation of high and low tides) influence the behavior of these animals that migrate vertically at each tide: at rising tide the colonies sink into the sand, they rise to the surface at the beginning of the ebb tide and become visible in interstitial seawater flowing. Sand particle size is an important factor because it determines the ease of vertical movements of the worms. The latter always remain in contact with seawater when the interstitial flows dry up during the ebb tide, and are also protected (buried in the sand) at rising tide, from dispersive effects of the waves. The colonies are located on the upper part of the foreshore, which is the least long-term covered layer of water during the tidal cycle. Colonies of S. roscoffensis are therefore in this place theoretically exposed to the longest light exposure to maximize the photosynthetic activity of micro-algae partners. Light is an essential biotic factor since the photosynthetic activity of algae in hospite is the only contribution to nutrient intake for the animals. The works of Louis Martin refer to the presence of S. roscoffensis in the interstitial seawater flows at low tide nights showing bright reflection of the Sun on the Moon. The latter has also shown that the worms, captive in the laboratory, gather mostly on the surface of the container when the tide is low and migrate to the bottom when the tide is high. In the thermo and photo-regulated chambers where the worms do not physically perceive the rising or falling tide, this vertical oscillation persists for 4 to 5 days and is then gradually lost and evolves in fine in a random occupation of the space in the container. The green patterns that align with the interstitial seawater flows (seeps of seawater) are colonies of several million individuals of Symsagittifera roscoffensis that reside in a thin film of water, exposed to the sun. Another movement characteristic to the species, sometimes observed in puddles of seawater and in the laboratory, brings together hundreds or even thousands of individuals to realize a circular procession. Modeling work shows that this social behavior is self-organized and is initiated by the movement of an individual who drives the worms to its proximity, thereby propagating the movement to an increasing density of worms that move in a coordinated way. Symsagittifera roscoffensis is thus a model for studying and understanding how individual behavior can lead to collective behavior. As early as 1924, zoologists observed the behavior of S. roscoffensis in response to the acidification of its environment. After forced diffusion of CO2 (carbon dioxide) gas into seawater, the dissolved CO2 concentration increases until the medium is saturated and generates carbonic acid and releases an H+ ion (CO2\\\\+ H2O ‚Üî H+ \\\\+ HCO3-). The increase in H + ions causes a decrease in pH and therefore an increase in acidity. Under the effect of the abrupt and pronounced decrease of the pH, S. roscoffensis contracts, turns on itself, then gradually expels its algal partners. The worm gradually loses its green color and usually dies after a few hours. This experience mimics the effects of ocean acidification, which is today the major consequence (with the rise in temperatures) of anthropogenic activities, particularly the combustion of fossil fuels, which generates very high concentrations of CO2. This photosymbiotic system \\"S.roscoffensis / T. convolutae\\" allows to explore and evaluate the effect of acidification on oceanic photosymbiotic species, the most emblematic of which are corals. Coral bleaching, which results mainly from the rise in ocean temperature but which is aggravated with acidification, results in the dissociation of the algae / animal partnership leading to the expulsion of the algae. Although it may be reversible, bleaching is a direct illustration of the environmental changes that are threatening more and more coral reefs and the many associated species.  Anatomy of the adult and reproduction of the species  The adult worm is about 4 to 5 mm long. In the anterior part (the head), we distinguish a statocyst or otolith: a gravito-sensor that allows the worm to orient itself in space and to show a negative geotropism (a mechanical stimulus against the wall of a tube containing worms triggers their active dive to the bottom of the tube). Left: anterior end (\\"head\\") of Symsagittifera roscoffensis; one clearly see the green micro-algae and in the center one see the statocyst (circular) flanked by 2 photoreceptors (brown spots equidistant from the statocyst). Above right: detail of the statocyst. Below right: the two photoreceptors are indicated by yellow arrows. The worm has two photoreceptors flanking the statocyst: the perception of light allows the worm to move towards enlightened environments: one speak of positive phototropism. This adaptation likely maximizes the probability of encounter between the free microalga and the non-symbiotic juvenile which also presents this positive phototropism. S. roscoffensis, exposed to different light intensities tends to move and expose itself to higher intensities than those at which free micro- algae perform optimal photosynthesis. Other works have shown experimentally that if it has the choice, the photosymbiotic worm avoids exposing itself to extreme light conditions: either too weak or too strong. In its environment, it is suspected that a temporary burying allows to escape to too strong intensities (photoinhibition). This worm has a central (brain) and peripheral nervous system. When one amputates the anterior part (\\"the head\\" containing the brain), one can observe a capacity of regeneration of the whole central nervous system in about twenty days with a joint recovery of the normal behavior. However, the different biological functions are not regenerated at the same speed: if the phototropism, which is associated with the regeneration of the photoreceptors, is recovered quickly, the geotropism, which is associated with the regeneration of the statocyst, is not recovered for several weeks. S. roscoffensis does not have a circulatory blood system: the diffusion of oxygen through the tissues is passive. Part of this oxygen also comes from the photosynthetic activity of the in hospite algae. The surface of the animal is abundantly ciliated and strewn with numerous mucus-secreting glands. Mucus provides a physical network allowing the worms to move in the seeps of seawater. An in-depth study on the behavior of S. roscoffensis in situ explains that the only possibility for the worm to move horizontally is to make a support (invisible to the naked eye) which is nothing other than a matrix synthesized from secreted mucus. By observing closely, we see that animals do not slide directly on the sand but \\"give the impression of sliding on an invisible surface\\". The author of this study hypothesized that animals, moving \\"above\\" the sandy substrate, would also receive more light by reflecting light rays, taking advantage of more photosynthesis and hence nutrient transfer for the worm. Secreted mucus is also an interface (biofilm) between the animal and its environment. Specific bacterial populations develop and appear to be hosted in the mucus, being hence intimately involved in the worm biology. On the left a gravid S. Roscoffensis adult: the white double string are mature oocytes that will be rapidly fertilized. Each pregnant adult deposits the fertilized oocytes in a translucent cocoon in which between 10 and 20 embryos develop. This triptych (animal + micro-algae + bacterial consortium) is a good example of the Holobiont paradigm that explains that an organism (animal or plant) is a complex and dynamic association involving microbial populations necessary for development, growth and to some extent, for the life of the organism. S. roscoffensis does not have a digestive system at any time during its development. However, on its ventral side there is an orifice considered as \\"a mouth\\" which allows it to ingest (without digesting) the micro-algae Tetraselmis convolutae. The latter gives access to a digestive syncytium through which the future micro-algae in hospite is first vacuolated (it loses its flagella and its theca) then transits to be finally located under the epidermis of the animal without being internalized in the cells but in contact and between the cells of the worm. Symsagittifera roscoffensis also has a muscular system consisting of a complex network of transversal, longitudinal, circular and dorsal-ventral muscle fibers. This worm is hermaphrodite but does not self-fertilize: it must mate with a partner to reproduce. Mature spermatozoa are produced at the posterior end of the animal. The oocytes are fertilized by the spermatozoa of the partners who are stored, after mating, in a spermatheca. This spermatheca is connected to the oocytes by one canal. Each gravid individual will produce from the mucus that it secretes abundantly a transparent cocoon in which are released the fertilized oocytes. Embryos, whose number varies and can reach twenty, develop synchronously. In the laboratory and depending on the rearing conditions, after 4 to 5 days, the juveniles hatch, escape from the cocoon and begin their quest for the photosynthetic partner. If the micro-algae is not ingested, the non-symbiotic juveniles in the laboratory die after about 20 days.  Phylogeny: incertae sedis?  In 1886, Yves Delage wondered about the simplicity of the acoela body plan organization: is it the consequence of a loss, of regressions of characters during the evolution or the acoels preserved, for certain characters, an ancestral body plan organization? These flatworms were first assimilated to Turbellaria within the phylum plathelminthes, mainly on the basis of morphological resemblances. After numerous phylogenetics and phylogenomics studies, these acoela worms were placed within the subphylum Acoelomorpha phylum Xenacoelomorpha. The phylogenetic position of the acoela is unstable and has been the subject of much discussion: arguments place them at the base of the bilaterians, before the deuterostomians/protostomians dichotomy, while others place them rather at the base of deuterostomians. Regardless of their phylogenetic position within metazoans, acoela may have retained some ancestral traits of bilaterians during evolution and thus represent an object of study that would potentially help to better understand the diversification of body plan organization in animals with bilateral symmetry.  The photosynthetic partner and the modus vivendi between the animal and the micro-algae   Discovery and characteristics of the partner micro-algae  Neither Geddes (1879), who observed the presence of starch and chlorophyll in the green cells present in the tissues, nor Delage (1886) and Haberlandt (1891) had formally been able to identify their origin and nature, however, suspecting micro-algae. The algae is seen digesting the worms poo and distributing it throughout the body. This plate representing various phenotypes of Tetraselmis convolutae, including the free-living flagellate form, is taken from an article published in 1907 by F. Keeble and FW Gamble entitled \\"The origin and nature of the green cells of Convolute roscoffensis\\". (Plate 14) in the journal Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science, vol 51. p 167-219. In 1901, in Roscoff, William Gamble and Frederick Keeble began to study these green cells in hospite and tried to isolate them and put them into cultivation‚Äîwith no success. In 1905, they observed non-symbiotic juveniles that were greening as they had hatched from cocoons, originally laid in unfiltered seawater, but transferred and incubated in filtered seawater. They hypothesized that the factor infecting juveniles and conferring the green color was probably on the surface or inside the cocoon. In a second experiment, they removed empty cocoons (post-hatching) initially contained in unfiltered seawater and then transferred and incubated them in filtered seawater. After 3 weeks, they observed in the filtered seawater a greening of these cocoons and the accumulation of unicellular organisms green and flagellated. This experiment allowed to isolate these green microorganisms. The microscopic observations of these cells showed characteristics of the micro-algae, showing (among other things) the presence of a violet color after treatment with iodine, revealing the presence of starch, diagnosis of photosynthetic activity. The contact between non- symbiotic juveniles, reared under sterile conditions, with these flagellate green cells allowed to induce photosymbiosis: these founding works demonstrated that the green cells in hospite were in fact flagellated microalgae in the free living state and that they were the \\"infective\\" factor causing the green coloration of adults (absent in non-symbiotic juveniles). Thus, there is no vertical transmission of the symbionts (transmitted by the parents) but a horizontal acquisition at each new generation (i.e., the symbionts are in the environment). Tetraselmis convolutae belongs to the class Chlorodendrophyceae within the division Chlorophyta. This alga has remarkable characteristics, including four flagella, a theca (polysaccharide envelope) and a vacuole (stigma or \\"eyespot\\") that contains photo-receptor molecules. T. convolutae lives in the free living state in the water column but is mainly benthics. Thus, in hospite, the alga does not have the same phenotype as in the free living state: it no longer has its flagella, its theca and stigma. These phenotypical differences did not allow Geddes, Delage and Haberlandt to deduce that the green cells in the tissues could have been micro-algae.  Life cycle  The captive life cycle is completed (from the adult to the gravid adult) in about 2.5 to 3 months.  Modus vivendi: a highly integrated partnership‚Äînot only additive  Juvenile Symsagittifera roscoffensis (about 1/2 millimeter long) at an early stage of symbiosis Few works describe the trophic nature of the exchanges between the animal and its photosynthetic partners. The photosynthetic activity provides, in addition to oxygen, various organic compounds: amino acids, proteins, polysaccharides and fatty acids. Micro-algae recycle uric acid (coming from the worm's nitrogen metabolism) for the synthesis of its amino acids / proteins. The assimilation of uric acid by S. roscoffensis has attracted the attention of early experimenters, including Louis Destouches aka Louis Ferdinand C√©line who carried out work on the physiology of these animals and who concluded in 1920 \\"that it is therefore very likely that symbiotic exchanges lead to the transformation of uric acid into nitrogenous food for zoochlorella\\". Douglas has formally shown that endogenous uric acid from the worm (derived from its metabolism) is a source of nitrogen for micro-algae and that non-symbiotic juveniles contain uric acid crystals that disappear 15 to 20 days after the establishment of symbiosis. However, the author proposes that if exogenous uric acid is not used by the worm and that if its concentration in the medium culture decreases over time it is because of a bacterial activity associated with the animals. Near resurgences rich in nitrate, in intertidal areas where live S. roscoffensis, worms are able to assimilate significant amounts of nitrate depending on the exposure and intensity of light. This quantity is ten times greater than that absorbed by the alga in the free living state. So, S. roscoffensis could be a major nitrate interceptor. In the tissues of the animal, the micro-algae produces a sulfur compound, DMSP (dimethylsulfoniopropionate), which also diffuses into the environment. This compound is generally degraded enzymatically by DMSP-lyases to acrylic acid and DMS (Dimethyl sulfide). However, no DMSP-lyase activity was measured in cultures of Tetraselmsis convolutae alone. Bacterial DMSP-lyase activity has been hypothesized to explain the presence of DMS and acrylic acid in colonies of S. roscoffensis. It is likely that S. roscoffensis mucus (such as the mucus of other photosymbiotic animals such as corals) harbor specific bacterial populations expressing DMSP-lyases. DMSP is a sulfur compound that exhibit, among other things, a repellent property that could confer a chemical barrier explaining the absence of known or observed predators and as a consequence the abundance of worms within colonies.

It breeds in Caribbean lowlands and foothills up to 1000 m altitude from eastern Nicaragua to northern Costa Rica, although all Nicaraguan records are historical specimens collected near Lake Nicaragua or its outflow. It is an uncommon inhabitant of mature evergreen forest and tall secondary growth, usually in dense understory vegetation on the woodland edges, along streams, in natural clearings, or in cacao plantations. The nest is built by the female in a natural cavity or a woodpecker hole in a tree or bamboo up to 6 m above the ground. The eggs are undescribed, but tyrant flycatchers typically lay two eggs which are incubated by the female for 15‚Äì16 days to hatching, The tawny- chested flycatcher is 12 cm long, weighs 7 g and looks like a colourful Empidonax flycatcher in size and structure . It has a grey head with a white throat and white spectacles. The upperparts are olive-green, and the wings are dusky with two bright ochre wing bars and ochre edging to the secondary feathers. The breast is ochre-orange, becoming bright yellow on the belly. Sexes are similar, but females may have an olive tint to the grey head. The tawny-chested flycatcher is seen alone or in pairs, and follows a regular route seeking insects, especially beetles and ants, picked from the underside of foliage in flight. This species has a rapid ' call. It sometimes fans and closes its tail nervously. Logging, conversion to banana plantations and cattle-ranch expansion have resulted in widespread forest clearance and severe fragmentation, particularly in Costa Rica. This species‚Äô small range and intolerance of forest fragmentation suggest that it is declining, although more research is needed. The crevice nesting habit may aid in the conservation of the species since the introduced Guadua bamboo is widely planted to support banana trees on plantations.

She served as a commissioned ship for 17 months. The name is Latin and means the golden one. Aurelia (AKA-23) was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1884) on 5 February 1944 at Providence, R.I., by the Walsh-Kaiser Co., Inc.; launched on 4 July 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Roy P. Mills; and acquired and commissioned on 14 October 1944, Lt. Comdr. E. G. MacMurdy in command. Service history 1944 In early November 1944, the attack cargo ship got underway for shakedown training in the Chesapeake Bay. She arrived at Norfolk, Va., on the 23d to embark troops and load cargo, sailed on the 28th for Hawaii ‚Äî via the Panama Canal ‚Äî and reached Pearl Harbor on 17 December. 1945 Aurelia got underway on 5 January 1945 to carry troops and cargo to Eniwetok and Guam. She returned to Hawaii on 5 February to embark more troops. On the 13th, the ship sailed, via Eniwetok, for the Philippines. She dropped anchor at Leyte on 4 March and began unloading her cargo the next day. On 6 March, she embarked combat troops scheduled to assault Okinawa and got underway for training maneuvers. Three weeks later, the attack cargo ship headed for the Ryukyus. On 1 April, D day for the landings on Okinawa, she entered the transport area and began lowering her boats. Aurelia continued to operate in that embattled area until 14 April when she headed for Saipan. On the 16th, she continued on toward Hawaii. After a four-day stay in Pearl Harbor, the ship sailed for the California coast and arrived at Alameda on 12 May. The vessel moved to San Diego on 7 June for amphibious training exercises. She began loading her cargo at San Pedro on 24 June and put to sea on the 30th. Aurelia reached Pearl Harbor on 6 July and, 10 days later, sailed for Saipan, via Eniwetok. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 12 August. While she was in port there, word of Japan's capitulation on 15 August reached the ship. Aurelia embarked Marines slated for occupation duty and got underway on 1 September for Japan. The ship debarked her passengers at Sasebo and sailed on 26 September for the Philippines to pick up Army troops and equipment for transportation to Sasebo. The vessel reached Sasebo on 21 October and was then assigned to the Magic Carpet fleet. She received on board Marine Corps personnel for passage back to the United States and delivered them to San Francisco on 13 November. She stood out to sea on the 29th for her last round-trip voyage to the Orient, embarked another contingent of veterans in Japan, and arrived back in San Francisco on 16 January 1946. Decommissioning On 24 January, Aurelia sailed, via the Panama Canal, for the Gulf Coast. She reached New Orleans, La., on 7 February and was decommissioned at Orange, Texas, on 14 March 1946. The ship was then transferred to the Maritime Commission, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 19 June 1946. Aurelia earned one battle star for World War II service.

It requires corresponding laws to be passed that incorporate it into each member state's legal system. The Directive is concerned mainly with the \\"substantive\\" law (meaning in this context the standards of behaviour required of traders). To some extent it leaves to member states the choice of appropriate domestic enforcement procedures and penalties for non-compliance (Articles 11 to 13 of the Directive). Contents Recitals The recitals state the objective of the Directive to reduce barriers to free trade in the EU while simultaneously ensuring a high level of consumer protection. At issue was the fact that the consumer protection laws are different among the various member states (see Article 1 of the Directive and the recitals to it). The Directive is supposed to reduce these differences while establishing a required minimum level of consumer protection across all member states. This is expected to benefit both business and consumers, as businesses receive a more standardised legal system under which to operate and consumers receive a sufficient and standardised level of protection, regardless of where they choose to make purchases. The Directive is designed to achieve what is called \\"maximum harmonisation\\" of business-to-consumer fair trade. The idea of \\"maximum harmonisation\\" is that it requires member states of the European Union to apply the standards set out in European legislation and prohibits those states from applying lower or higher standards. In other words, the Directive tells European countries to give consumers no more and no less than the level of protection set out in the Directive. That maximum harmonisation is not yet in force. Chapter 1 The Directive starts with a general prohibition on unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices (Articles 3(1) and 5(1)) and then goes into progressively greater detail defining what that means. Article 3(2) states the Directive is expressly \\"without prejudice to contract law and, in particular, to the rules on the validity, formation or effect of a contract\\" (see also the 9th recital to the Directive). It does not seek to harmonise unfair competition law regulating \\"...commercial practices which, although not harming consumers, may hurt competitors and business customers\\" (8th recital to the Directive). Chapter 2 Article 5(1) says that \\"unfair commercial practices\\" are prohibited, and under article 5(2)(a) these are practices that are \\"contrary to the requirements of professional diligence\\" (see further Article 2(h)) and that are likely to materially distort the economic behaviour of the average consumer (Article 5(2)(b)). The effect of commercial practices on particular kinds of consumers, especially those who are unusually vulnerable, can replace the \\"average consumer\\" test if the practices are directed at those kinds of consumers or will foreseeably affect them (Articles 5(2)(b) and 5(3)). The Directive describes two major categories of unfair commercial practices:- those that are misleading (Articles 5(4)(a), 6 and 7) and those that are aggressive (Articles 5(4)(b), 8 and 9). Annex 1 to the Directive sets out a list of \\"commercial practices that are, in all circumstances, considered unfair\\" (a black-list of bad behaviour). These are divided into \\"misleading commercial practices\\" (23 examples) and \\"aggressive commercial practices\\" (8 examples). On a literal reading of the Directive, misleading or aggressive commercial practices that would not affect the average consumer's economic behaviour, but would distort the economic behaviour of particular kinds of consumer, may be prohibited only by the general clause in Articles 5(1) to 5(3), and not by the specific clauses in Articles 6 to 9. This is because the latter provisions refer exclusively to the \\"average consumer\\" (although Article 9(c) also refers to the \\"exploitation of any specific misfortune or circumstance of such gravity as to impair the consumer's judgement, of which the trader is aware...\\"). However, it might be fairer to read Articles 5(2)(b) and 5(3) as supplanting the references to the \\"average consumer\\" in Articles 6 to 9 in appropriate cases. The UK Government's Department of Trade and Industry published a consultation paper in December 2005, which suggested that that was indeed the intention. There is no clear basis in the text for the favoured interpretation, but the UK Government supports its interpretation with reference to the European Commission's Explanatory Memorandum. This could be important because depending on the answer to this question it may be easier or harder to pin down a breach of the Directive. The rules referred to in the actual text of the Directive in relation to codes of conduct are quite limited (e.g. Article 6(2)(b), prohibiting non-compliance with codes of conduct in some circumstances, and Article 10). However, the 20th recital states: \\"It is appropriate to provide a role for codes of conduct ... In sectors where there are specific mandatory requirements ... these will also provide evidence as to the requirements of professional diligence in that sector. ... consumers' organisations could be informed and involved in the drafting of codes of conduct.\\" Subscribers to a code of conduct drafted with the input of and endorsed by a major consumers' organisation could seek to argue during enforcement proceedings that compliance with the code of conduct is therefore evidence that they have not engaged in unfair commercial practices. Those charged with promoting and administering membership of codes of conduct will take note that Article 11(1) in effect contemplates the possibility of class-actions brought by consumer groups against code-owners where the code promotes non-compliance with legal requirements. Taken together, these provisions may be an incentive for those who administer and promote codes of conduct to consult with consumers' groups and take careful legal advice in relation to the drafting of such codes. Chapters 3 and 4 Chapter 3 envisages a role for businesses in the industry to draft codes of conduct about practices among their competitors. Chapter 4 requires that member states have, under article 11, \\"adequate and effective means exist to combat unfair commercial practices\\". This includes ensuring that consumer groups have standing to take representative legal action on behalf of the people whose interests they represent, or make complaints to the consumer authorities. Article 11(2) requires that public authorities exist (for instance, the Competition and Markets Authority or the Bundesamt f√ºr Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit). Article 11(3) requires that they should be impartial in fulfilling their role of protecting consumers against unfair business practices. Implementation The Directive required the member states to pass laws by no later than 12 June 2007 incorporating it into their own internal national law by 12 December 2007. However, until at least 12 June 2013, Member States will continue to be able to apply more protective national rules diverging from European directives insofar as it is necessary and proportionate to do so (Article 3(5)), meaning that maximum harmonisation may not be complete before that date. There will be a major review of the operation of the Directive by 12 June 2011 (Article 18).

They cover large areas that have been covered by ice, and occur mostly in what is believed to have been the central areas of the ice sheets. Rogen moraines are named after Lake RogenM√∂ller, P., 2006. Rogen moraine: an example of glacial re-shaping of pre- existing landforms. Quaternary Science Reviews, 25:362-389 in H√§rjedalen, Sweden, the landform's type locality. Rogen Nature Reserve serves to protect the unusual area. The landform occurs in groups that are often closely and regularly spaced. They consist of glacial drift, with till being the most common constituent. The individual moraines are large, wavy ridges orientated transverse to ice flow. Drumlins are often found in close proximity of Rogen moraines, and are often interpreted to be formed at the same time as the Rogen moraines. Although Rogen moraines can span a large range of sizes, the most common distribution seems to be 10‚Äì30 metres high, 150‚Äì300 metres wide and 300‚Äì1,200 metres long. The exact mechanics of Rogen moraine formation are not known, but since the 1970s, several theories on the formation have been proposed: * Megaripples eroded in the basal ice fill during subglacial outburst floods.Fisher, T. G. & Shaw, J., 1992. A depositional model for Rogen moraine, with examples from the Avalon Peninsula, Newfoundland. Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, 29:669-686 * Already existing landforms, such as drumlins and flutesBoulton, G. S., 1987. A theory of drumlin formation by subglacial deformation. In: Menzies, J. & Rose, J. (Eds.), Drumlin Symposium, Balkema, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, pp. 25-80 or marginal moraines are reshaped due to a ‚âà90¬∞ change in the direction of the ice flow. * Debris-rich basal ice or pre-existing sediments are sheared and stacked, or folded during compressive ice flow.Lind√©n, M., M√∂ller, P. & Adrielsson, L., 2008. Ribbed moraine formed by subglacial folding, thrust stacking and lee-side cavity infill. Boreas, 37:102-131 * Shearing of sediment under a glacier causes growth of waves with spacing characteristic of Rogen moraine (300 m to 1000 m). * Sediment sheets become fractured and extended during a transition of the overlying glacier from being cold based ice to warm based. However, it has been suggested that, due to the diversity of morphological characteristics displayed by Rogen moraine, different processes might be able to create the landform. This means that all four of the processes mentioned above might be correct. The different theories that proposed a formation near or at the glacial margin have largely been abandoned. Some of these theories proposed that Rogen moraines had an origin as a series of end moraines, that they formed in association with calving ice termini in glacial lakes, or that Rogen moraines formed in dead-ice, where supraglacial material fell down into crevasses in the ice.

No rigorously monitored clinical trials of Armenicum have been published, and most HIV experts outside of Armenia do not endorse its use. In 1999, a BBC investigation involving interviews with scientists involved in administering the drug, patients and creator Alexander Ilyen raised serious doubts about the drug's efficacy, concluding that Armenicum might do more harm than good. Dr. Manfred Dietrich of the Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg told the BBC \\"I would not recommend at all to take such a drug.\\" while an American patient said \\"we‚Äôre in a worse state than we were before we went.\\" Worldwide, the most effective treatment for HIV are antiretroviral drugs, which in internationally accepted clinical trials have been the only proven way to keep patients alive, often for years. The drugs work by directly attacking and reducing the amount of HIV in the body, keeping the patient from developing Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a complete immune system failure that leads to death. The drugs, offered in cocktails of three or four at a time, are often changed as the virus becomes resistant. Alternatively, the makers of Armenicum claim it boosts the immune system, allowing the body to fight the virus. Armenicum clinic doctors also contend the drug has been shown to reduce a patient's viral load‚Äîthe amount of HIV in the body‚Äîand that HIV never becomes resistant to it. The problem is that company scientists have never tried to prove any of these claims. They admit to not even formally monitoring the 250 patients who have been treated with the drug during the period from 2004 to 2008. The main ingredient of Armenicum is iodine, a general antiseptic. According to the manufacturers it also contains dextrin, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium, potassium and lithium cations and chloride anions. It is described as a \\"blue-violet liquid with specific odor, packed in orange glass bottles per 20ml and corked tightly by a rubber plug clutched by aluminum caps.\\"ARMENICUM is a highly promising drug for treatment of HIV infection and AIDS When Armenicum was first introduced in Armenia in 1998, founders called it a \\"revolutionary cure for AIDS,\\" and it immediately captured Armenia's high-ranking government officials‚Äô interest. Early on, initial payments for Armenicum treatments came from the Armenian Defense Ministry, hoping to promote the drug's research and development. Armenicum's possibilities caused a buzz of excitement in the tiny country. Businessmen, it was reported in some newspapers in 1999, were buying up property so that they could rent it to all the people who would fly to Armenia to take the cure. However, as of November 2008, only about 800 people have taken Armenicum, which is financed by the Armenian government at a cost of around $6,000 per patient per year. Kolesnikov Controversy On 8 September 2000, Nikolai Kolesnikov, who had received treatment for AIDS in \\"Armenicum\\" center in Armenia was reported dead in one of Kaliningrad hospitals. According to his doctors, Armenicum turned out to be a simple immunity modular, without any effect on the virus which continues to damage the cells in the human body.Patient Treated With Armenicum Dies.

Williston Jones as the School for the Prophets. While canvassing churches in the East to raise money for students to attend Eastern seminaries, Jones met a farmer named Daniel Coe, who donated $1,500 and encouraged Jones to open a college in Cedar Rapids. Coe's gift came with the stipulation that the college should offer education to both men and women, and when the Cedar Rapids campus opened as the Cedar Rapids Collegiate Institute, it was founded as a co-educational institution. In 1875, the college was reestablished as Coe College Institute and in 1881, after a generous gift from T.M Sinclair, founder of the Sinclair Meat Packing Company, was finally founded as Coe College. Coe was accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Universities in 1907. Academics Coe College awards the following degrees: Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Bachelor of Music (B.M.), and Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.). Coe offers more than 60 areas of study and provides the option for students to create their own major under the guidance of faculty members. Forty percent of Coe students double major and graduate in four years. All students are guaranteed an internship, research or off-campus study opportunity.

Events History 2006 Tri-Nations Training Camp In 2006, the Wallabies used the ground in preparation for an upcoming game in the Tri Nations against New Zealand. They held an open training session on 10 August 2006 at Viking Park. As part of the training camp, Australia 'A' played a match at Viking Park against Tonga U18s on August 15, 2006. 2008 Women's Rugby International Test Series 7 July 2008, Australian Rugby Union (ARU) announced a twin test match series between the Wallaroos (Australia) and the Black Furns (New Zealand) to be played in Canberra at Viking Park in October 2008. The announced series was the first women's rugby internationals played in Australia since the 2001 Test against England in Newcastle. 14 October 2008, In the first test match, Australia started brightly but soon found themselves second best as New Zealand's forward pack led the visitors to run in three tries before half time to take a 19-3 lead into the break. After half time the Black Furns added another two tries to finish the match 37-3 victors. 18 October 2008, the second game on the Saturday night was a lot closer than the opening match a few days earlier. Australia led 10-8 early in the first half before New Zealand scored two tries to fight back into the lead at half time. The match remained tight but New Zealand were too strong for Australia in the end as they won the match 22-16 and clinched the series 2-0. 2014 FFA Cup 22 August 2014, Tuggeranong United drew A-League powerhouse Melbourne Victory in the round of 16 FFA Cup draw, giving the team from Canberra's south a home 2014 FFA Cup round of 16 match. Tuggeranong United could not use their normal home ground due to its inadequate lighting and facilities so the ACT NPL club announced Viking Park as the venue for the high-profile match. The draw also enabled the opportunity for an emotional homecoming for former Tuggeranong United junior and Socceroo midfielder Carl Valeri. In the lead-up to the Tuesday fixture, Tuggeranong United's players put their day jobs on hold and went into camp at the Alpha Hotel to prepare for the match at Viking Park against the Victory. 16 September 2014, Viking Park hosted its first Association football match between Tuggeranong United and Melbourne Victory in the 2014 FFA Cup. 5150 people turned out in what was the record breaking crowd for Viking Park until Olympic's 2016 FFA Cup fixture against Sydney FC. Tuggeranong United was put to the sword by a very strong Melbourne Victory team. A-League star and Victory marquee, Besart Berisha, scored a hat-trick on the night to lead Victory to a 6-0 drubbing of the home team. The venue and match were declared as a success with only one minor hiccup occurring at the match when a Melbourne Victory fan let off a flare. The man was arrested by ACT Police and received a fine and five-year ban. 2016 FFA Cup 29 September 2016, Viking Park was announced as the host venue for the FFA Cup semi-final clash between Canberra Olympic FC and Sydney FC after Olympic deemed the financial costs of hosting the game at Canberra Stadium to be too high as well as a better atmosphere at Viking Park being achievable. 19 October 2016, Viking Park played host to an FFA Cup semi-final for the first time in 2016. Canberra Olympic FC took on A-League heavyweights Sydney FC after playing the previous three rounds at smaller venue Deakin Stadium. 5,581 turned out to watch the match, which set a new record crowd for Viking Park. Canberra Olympic were the final NPL club left in the competition and they proved good competition for Sydney, especially in the early stages of the match. However, Olympic were not good enough to contain the star-studded Sydney-siders who played all their marquee signings against the Canberrans. Filip Holo≈°ko, Bob√¥ and returning Socceroo Bernie Ibini all starred for Sydney as they scored three goals to claim a three to nil victory over the home side. And with the loss, Olympic's unlikely dream 2016 FFA Cup run ended at Viking Park.

Background Daher was born in 1967 in the predominantly Christian south Lebanese town of Marjayoun and began working as a civil defense volunteer at the age of 12. In 1986, during the 1982-2000 South Lebanon conflict and Lebanese civil war of 1975-1990, he joined the civil defense service of the Lebanese interior ministry as an apprentice and worked his way up the ranks. His home town was at the centre of the 1982-2000 conflict, being the headquarters of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army militia, and was repeatedly attacked by Palestinian militias during the civil war and subsequently by the Hezbollah militia during Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon. He moved to the coastal city of Tyre in 1996, where the influence of Hezbollah is far weaker (the city is run by Hezbollah's secular rival Amal. By the time of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, he was working as the head of civil defense operations for Tyre and the surrounding region, including Qana. He has described himself as a first responder, \\"often the one who takes the phone call alerting the civil defense to an emergency, and he is often part of the first team to reach the site.\\" According to the Associated Press, which interviewed him, \\"when bombs strike, he races his ambulance along narrow country roads, digs through rubble and tries to save the living from flattened buildings\\". Daher was mentioned by the media on a number of occasions prior to the July 30, 2006 airstrike on Qana. The Al Jazeera network, the Lebanese Daily Star newspaper and several other media organisations cited his casualty figures for earlier incidents in the Israeli campaign. He has previously been seen in widely distributed photographs of the 1996 shelling of Qana in which 106 people were killed and 116 injured in an Israeli attack. On that occasion, he was photographed carrying the mutilated body of a child killed in the attack. Qana controversy On July 30, 2006, Daher was present at the scene of the Qana bombing, which occurred only about 12 km from his office at Tyre, and was photographed there by the international media. The pictures depicted him carrying dead children away from the site of the bombing, while wearing the green helmet that led to his nickname. He issued widely quoted casualty figures for the bombing at Qana. He cited 51 fatalities including 22 children, though later reports revised this to a lower figure of 28, including 16 children. The 2006 photographs and footage led to a number of websites labelling Daher the \\"Green Helmet\\", in reference to his distinctive headgear, and accusing him of being a member of Hezbollah and of using bodies for propaganda purposes. One website published a video that it asserted showed Daher arranging for a child's body to be taken off an ambulance to be displayed for photographers. British author Richard North asserted that Daher had taken control of the scene \\"to orchestrate false photo opportunities with the dead bodies\\". North later admitted to Jefferson Morley of the Washington Post that he had no evidence that Daher was connected to Hezbollah and, as he put it, \\"All I have to go on is gut instinct.\\" The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse news agencies, whose photographers had taken the \\"Green Helmet\\" pictures, all denied that the pictures from Qana had been staged. The Washington Post's photographer Michael Robinson-Chavez rejected the claims of staging, commenting: \\"Everyone was dead, many of them children. Nothing was set up. There was no way photos could have been altered with a dozen photographers there.\\" The Post's ombudsman, Deborah Howell, reviewed the pictures published by the newspaper and reported that they \\"didn't show any obvious manipulation.\\" The Associated Press was eventually able to identify \\"Green Helmet\\" as Salam Daher and interviewed him twice. He strongly denied having anything to do with Hezbollah, stating that the blog allegations were not true and that he was not affiliated with any party. He told the agency: \\"I am just a civil defense worker. I have done this job all my life.\\" Commenting on his display of some of the bodies at Qana, he said: \\"I did hold the baby up, but I was saying 'look at who the Israelis are killing. They are children. These are not fighters. They have no guns. They are children, civilians they are killing.'\\" He told the Associated Press that he had no regrets or apologies: \\"I wanted people to see who was dying. They said they were killing fighters. They killed children.\\" On August 13, 2006, Daher was reported to have been lightly injured in an Israeli attack near a hospital in Tyre shortly before a United Nations-brokered ceasefire in the conflict came into effect.

FTDP-17 is caused by mutations in the MAPT (microtubule associated protein tau) gene located on the q arm of chromosome 17, and has three cardinal features: behavioral and personality changes, cognitive impairment, and motor symptoms. FTDP-17 was defined during the International Consensus Conference in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1996. Pathophysiology The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the disorder are thought to be related to the altered proportion of tau isoforms or to the ability of tau to bind microtubules and to promote microtubule assembly. Diagnosis Definitive diagnosis of FTDP-17 requires a combination of characteristic clinical and pathological features and molecular genetic analysis. Genetic counseling should be offered to affected and at-risk individuals; for most subtypes, penetrance is incomplete. Management Currently, treatment for FTDP-17 is only symptomatic and supportive. Prognosis The prognosis and rate of the diseases progression vary considerably among individual patients and genetic kindreds, ranging from life expectancies of several months to several years, and, in exceptional cases, as long as two decades. Epidemiology The prevalence and incidence remain unknown but FTDP-17 is an extremely rare condition. It is caused by mutations in the MAPT gene, which encodes a microtubule-binding protein. Over 100 families with 38 different mutations in the tau gene have been identified worldwide. The phenotype of FTDP-17 varies not only between families carrying different mutations but also between and within families carrying the same mutations.

In the case of pure quantum states, it is a corollary of the no- cloning theorem: since quantum states cannot be copied in general, they cannot be broadcast. Here, the word \\"broadcast\\" is used in the sense of conveying the state to two or more recipients. For multiple recipients to each receive the state, there must be, in some sense, a way of duplicating the state. The no- broadcast theorem generalizes the no-cloning theorem for mixed states. The no- cloning theorem for pure states says that it is impossible to create two copies of an unknown state given a single copy of the state. The quantum no- broadcasting theorem, originally proven by Barnum, Caves, Fuchs, Jozsa and Schumacher for mixed states of finite-dimensional quantum systems , says that given a pair of quantum states which do not commute, there is no method capable of taking a single copy of either state and succeeding, no matter which state was supplied and without incorporating knowledge of which state has been supplied, in producing a state such that one part of it is the same as the original state and the other part is also the same as the original state. That is, given an initial unknown state \\\\rho_i, drawn from the set \\\\\\\\{\\\\rho_i\\\\\\\\}_{i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1,2\\\\\\\\}} such that [\\\\rho_1,\\\\rho_2] e 0, there is no process (using physical means independent of those used to select the state) guaranteed to create a state \\\\rho_{AB} in a Hilbert space H_A \\\\otimes H_B whose partial traces are Tr_A\\\\rho_{AB} = \\\\rho_i and Tr_B\\\\rho_{AB} = \\\\rho_i. Such a process was termed broadcasting in that paper. The theorem in also includes a converse: if two quantum states do commute, there is a method for the broadcasting them: they must have a common basis of eigenstates diagonalizing them simultaneously, and the map that clones every state of this basis is a legitimate quantum operation, requiring only physical resources independent of the input state to implemement---a completely positive map. A corollary is that there is a physical process capable of broadcasting every state in some set of quantum states if, and only if, every pair of states in the set commutes. The broadcasting map described above, which works in the commuting case, produces an overall state in which the two copies are perfectly correlated in their eigenbases. Remarkably, the theorem does not hold if more than one copy of the initial state is provided: for example, broadcasting six copies starting from four copies of the original state is allowed, even if the states are drawn from a non-commuting set. The purity of the state can even be increased in the process, a phenomenon known as superbroadcasting.

Heartbroken, Sally vows not to let herself fall in love again. Nevertheless, she agrees to a dinner date with Bill Page, an Army sergeant on a weekend pass, after Bill is stood up by her sophisticated friend Olive Lashbrooke. When Bill has trouble getting a hotel room, he ends up spending the weekend at Sally's apartment, which is considered risque under the social mores of the time. Although Bill and Sally sleep in separate rooms, the arrangement creates awkward situations for Sally, especially when she finds herself developing feelings for Bill.

Biography He was brought up at Chanteloup, under the care of his relative, Etienne Fran√ßois, duc de Choiseul, who was childless. In 1778, he married his cousin, Marie Stephanie de Choiseul-Stainville, daughter of Etienne's younger brother Jacques Philippe de Choiseul, marquis de Choiseul-Stainville. The latter had only daughters, so Claude became heir to the family titles. When the French Revolution erupted, he was a colonel of Dragoons, and throughout the following period, he remained a Legitimist. Choiseul-Stainville took part in the attempt of King Louis XVI to escape from Paris on 20 June 1791, was arrested with the king, and imprisoned (see Flight to Varennes). Liberated in May 1792, he fled France in October, and fought in the √©migr√© army of Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Cond√© against the French Republic. Captured in 1795, he was confined at Dunkirk, escaped, set sail for India, was wrecked on the French coast, and condemned to death by the decree of the French Directory. Nevertheless, he was fortunate enough to escape once more. Napoleon Bonaparte allowed him to return to France in 1801, but he remained in private life until the fall of the First French Empire in 1815. After the Bourbon Restoration he was called to the new Chambre des Pairs (House of Peers) by King Louis XVIII. During the Revolution of 1830, he was nominated a member of the provisional government. He afterwards received from Louis-Philippe the post of aide-de-camp to the king and governor of the Louvre Palace. He died in Paris eight years later.

He was the son of Ats√Øz.  Reign  In 1152 Il-Arslan was made governor of Jand, an outpost on the Syr Darya which had recently been reconquered, by his father. In 1156 Ats√Øz died and Il-Arslan succeeded him as Khwarazm-Shah. Like his father, he decided to pay tribute to both the Seljuk sultan Sanjar and the Qara Khitai gurkhan. Sanjar died only a few months after Il-Arslan's ascension, causing Seljuk Khurasan to descend into chaos. This allowed Il- Arslan to effectively break off Seljuk suzerainty, although he remained on friendly terms with Sanjar's successor, Mas'ud. They were alleged to have attempted to create a joint campaign against the Qara Khitai, but such an alliance never occurred. Like his father, Il-Arslan sought to expand his influence in Khurasan, and in the 1160s took an active interest in the area by supplying armies to local allies, but despite the collapse of central Seljuk authority in that area, he was unable to make any significant headway against the regional rulers. In 1158 Il-Arslan became involved in the affairs of another Qara Khitai vassal state, the Karakhanids of Samarkand. The Karakhanid Chaghr√Ø Khan had been persecuting the Qarluks in his realm, and several Qarluk leaders fled to Khwarazm and sought Il-Arslan's help. He responded by invading the Karakhnid dominions, taking Bukhara and besieging Samarkand, where Chaghr√Ø Khan had taken refuge. The latter appealed to both the Turks of the Syr Darya and the Qara Khitai, and the gurkhan sent an army, but its commander hesitated to enter into conflict with the Khwarazmis. In the end a peace was mediated where Chaghr√Ø Khan was forced to take back the Qarluk leaders and restore them to their former positions. In 1172 the Qara Khitai launched a punitive expedition against Il-Arslan, who had not paid the required annual tribute. The shah collected his army but soon became sick and turned over his forces to one of his lieutenants. The Khwarazmi army was defeated, however, and Il- Arslan died shortly after. Following his death the state briefly became embroiled in turmoil, as the succession was disputed between his sons Tekish and Sultan Shah. Sources *Biran, Michael.

He managed Manchester City between 1950 and 1963, and then Oldham Athletic until 1965. McDowall was the longest serving manager in Manchester City's history, his tenure spanning 13 years. Though born in India, McDowall was brought up as a Scot. A wing half or centre half, he spent five years of his playing career at Sunderland mainly as a reserve to Alex Hastings. Manchester City paid ¬£7,000 for his services in 1937 and between then and 1948 he played 129 times for the team scoring 8 goals. He was also captain of the time for a short while. He briefly moved to Wrexham's Racecourse Ground to take up the managerial post before being brought back to Maine Road in 1950 and installed as manager.http://www.bluemoon- mcfc.co.uk/History/Managers/Manager.aspx?id=13 The club was languishing in the second tier of English football, McDowall set to work building a solid team and soon saw the fruits of his labour, with the club returning to the first division the following season. Solid if unspectacular progress was made in the early 1950s, with some notable results along the way; the most significant being a handful of derby victories against Manchester United. McDowall was an innovator, undoubtedly ahead of his time, inspired by the great Hungarian side of the era he pioneered the use of wing backs and the deployment of a forward playing between the strikers and midfield. These revolutionary tactical systems, more commonly associated with the game as we know it today, were not an instant success however and City leaked more than five goals in a game on three occasions in the 1955‚Äì56 season. Don Revie was a key player in McDowall's team and it was with Revie that he masterminded the \\"Revie Plan\\", centred on the plan's namesake playing in a withdrawn striker's role. McDowall's tactical brainstorming and tinkering, which had generally been met with scorn and derision from the majority of fans at Maine Road, eventually bore fruit and the club was rewarded with consecutive appearances in the FA Cup finals of 1955 (lost 1‚Äì3 to Newcastle United) and 1956, winning the latter against Birmingham City 3‚Äì1. The mid 1950s were the high points of McDowall's career as manager of Manchester City. An ageing team and limited resources saw the club begin to wane and fall towards the foot of the first division by the beginning of the 1960s, culminating in relegation to the second division in the 1962‚Äì63 season. With relegation came the end of McDowall's tenure at Manchester City. He went on to manage Oldham Athletic from June 1963 to March 1965 before quitting management. He died 18 August 1991 at the age of 78. McDowall was an active freemason.

It ran for a single series in 2002 and launched the career of Jodie Marsh. Format The ITV programme featured the daily lives of a number of women, including Jodie Marsh, which led to her subsequent career. The show used the nickname golden triangle to describe the settlements of Chigwell, Buckhurst Hill and Loughton in the Epping Forest district upon which the series was centered. The area is well known for its high property prices and relative affluence of its residents compared to the national average. Several properties are owned by professional footballers; their spouses, as well as others of a similar stature, have been referred to as WAGs by the tabloid press. They are relatively rich, but do not work regularly and chose to spend most of the day socialising instead. The programme featured stereotypical activities of these women, such as visiting Jacuzzis, nail bars, tanning, shopping at Prada or performing yoga. It was criticised for giving an inaccurate portrayal of Essex life; towns elsewhere in the county such as Halstead and Colchester or natural features such as the Colne Valley do not generally exhibit the behaviour seen on Essex Wives, including \\"white stilettos, shiny leatherette handbags or ankle chains\\". The series pointed out that Chigwell has ten beauty salons and four nail bars, and said that some of the wives had decided to seek modelling jobs for their young children.

Built in 1704, it is well-preserved example of an early Delaware Valley stone house, which served as a residence of one family for over 150 years. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1967. It is open for tours on weekends between May and October, or by appointment.  History  The William Brinton 1704 House was built in 1704 by William Brinton, Jr. (also known as \\"William the Younger\\" or \\"William the Builder\\"). It was sold out of the family in 1860. In 1881, a serpentine stone wing was added to the home. In 1947 the house was purchased by Brinton descendants and donated to the West Chester Historical Society. In the 1950s, architect G. Edwin Brumbaugh restored the building to its original form by removing the 1881 wing and other Gothic embellishments. The Brinton House (1878) by Thomas Eakins. The William Brinton 1704 House was one of the 14 houses standing in the battlefield area of the Battle of Brandywine, fought on September 11, 1777 during the American Revolutionary War. In 1878, Thomas Eakins painted the Brinton House as it would have originally appeared.  Description  The Brinton House stands south of West Chester, on the east side of Oakland Road south of its junction with Brinton's Bridge Road. Its main block is a rectangular stone structure, built out of locally quarried stone laid in courses of irregular height. The walls are thick and two stories in height. The end walls each have a brick chimney on the outside. There is a steep roof and pent eaves are in place over the first floor windows on the north and south sides of the house. The home also boasts 27 reproduction windows of leaded sash with diamond lights. Most of the original flooring is still in use.

Wu set the world record in a time of 2:09.72 in Shanghai at China's National Games in October 1997. Wu first caught attention when she won China's 1996 Olympic Trials in a world-leading 2:12.87, defeating 1992 Olympic champion Lin Li into second place. She also placed 2nd in the 400 IM in a strong 4:41.20. Much like most of her teammates, however, she eventually failed at the Atlanta Games, failing to qualify for the finals of both medley events. Had she repeated her trials times in Atlanta, she could have won gold in the 200 IM and silver in the 400. In fact, her 200 IM time was over 1 second faster than Michelle Smith's winning time in Atlanta (2:13.93), and ranked first globally for 1996. One year after the Olympics, Wu set a world record of 2:09.72 at the 1997 Chinese National Games, where she also placed 2nd in the 400 IM (4:36.28; the race was won by Chen Yan in a world record of 4:34.79) and third in the 200 back (2:10.71) and 200 fly (2:10.45). She went on to win the 200 IM at the 1998 World Championships in Perth, Australia in the 2nd fastest time ever (2:10.88), and also placed 4th in the 200 fly (2:10.22, the only Chinese swimmer to set a personal best in Perth) and 400 IM (4:40.16). After the win, her times dropped off significantly, though she managed to win the 200 IM gold at the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, Thailand (2:15.12). She also competed in the 1999 Short Course Worlds in Hong Kong but did not medal. Wu's performance improved suddenly at the national championships (also serving at China's Olympic Trials) in Jinan City in May 2000, where she won the 200 IM in 2:14.02 (third in the world at that time), thereby leading to growing suspicions that she was involved in doping. Soon it was confirmed that she failed to dope test following the Trials in Jinan, and she was banned for four years by the Chinese authorities. An anabolic steroid was found in her system. The 22-year- old denied taking drugs but was immediately dropped by China's Olympic Team preparing for 2000 Summer Olympics that September, and was fined $964 by the Chinese Swimming Association. Her coach Wu Jicai was given a $482 fine and banned for one year. Consequently, Wu Yanyan's world record, which stood for over 10.5 years, is considered a tainted one. The American Katie Hoff, who specialises in the individual medley, stated that erasing the record is \\"my one and only goal\\". Eventually, it was Australian Stephanie Rice who lowered Wu's record to 2:08.92 on March 25, 2008 at the 2008 Australian Swimming Championships. Hoff bettered the World mark later that same year, at the USA Olympic Trials.

But only a short section was built. Construction The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Tramways Company was formed in 1903 but it was not until 1913 that the tramway opened from Ripley to Nottingham, by way of Langley Mill, Eastwood and Kimberley. The capital was funded by Balfour Beatty & Co., of Ilkeston. Many of the bridges which can be seen along the route date from this time (for example, the bridge over the canal at Langley Mill, that had previously been a wooden construction). The original Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Tramways Company Bill of 1902 was an ambitious application which proposed the building of of track to link together the tramway systems of Nottingham, Derby and Ilkeston. However, when passed the following year the Act only authorized the construction of of route, of which only were laid, the section from Ripley to Cinderhill. This was the beginning of the service known locally as the Ripley Rattlers. Operation The first tramcar services started on 4 July 1913, only 5 months after linelaying had begun. This was between Loscoe and Kimberley, and the section to Cinderhill was opened a month later. The completed line from Cinderhill to Ripley opened on 1 January 1914 which made it possible to travel from Nottingham to Ripley, a distance of , in 1 hr 40 mins. The trams ran 18 hours a day, except for Sunday when the service was reduced. Fares were a penny a mile. Workmen boarding before 8 am were able to obtain return tickets at single prices, while colliers journeying to and from the pits were charged a penny regardless of the length of their journey. The first trams left the depot at 4.30 am, while the last tram, 'The Flyer', left Nottingham at 11pm with limited stops only. It was, by reputation, the most dangerous tramcar service in the British Isles, due to the length of its route, and the gradients it negotiated. The line was the subject of a short story by D. H. Lawrence: There is in the North a single-line system of tramcars which boldly leaves the county town and plunges off into the black, industrial countryside . . . . . This, the most dangerous tram-service in England, as the authorities themselves declare, with pride, is entirely conducted by girls, and driven by rash young men, or else by invalids who creep forward in terror. Transcript of \\"Tickets Please\\" by D.H.Lawrence In 1916, the company also took over the Ilkeston Corporation Tramways, but the routes of the two companies never joined (and being different gauges, this seemed an unlikely proposition). Mergers During the 1920s, the improved performance of motor transport gave significant competition to the trams from the many early omnibus companies. Not to be left out, in 1920 Balfour Beatty established the Midland General Omnibus Company (it was initially called the General, but changed its name after buying the Midland Bus Company from Kimberley). The M.G.O. shared the Notts & Derbys base at Langley Mill. The three Balfour Beatty companies, the Midland General Omnibus Company, the Notts and Derbys Tramways Company and the older Mansfield District Traction Company, formed a single group of companies called the Midland General Group. The Midland General snapped up many of the smaller companies in the area in the 1920s and 1930s, taking over Brewin and Hudson of Heanor, Williamson & Son of Heanor, J.T.Boam of Ilkeston, and the Heanor & District Omnibus Company. Decline and closure By 1928, Nottinghamshire & Derbyshire was given power to operate a trolley bus system. The first trolley buses were introduced in 1931, and on 5 October 1933 the last tram ran on the Nottingham to Ripley route. The trolley bus system was very efficient and reliable, the journey from Ripley to Nottingham taking 90 minutes. Trolley bus operation continued until 25 April 1953, when they gave way to the bus. The fleet of trolley buses was sold to Bradford Corporation. Near to the Queen Adelaide pub in Swingate, there is an old cable pole (or what looks like one).

He was also the 8th Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan from October 1919 to September 1923, and the first civilian to hold that position. Den was also a co-founder of Kaishinsha Motorcar Works, a predecessor to present-day Nissan and the original manufacturer of Datsun automobiles.  Biography  Den was born in Tanba-Kaibara Domain, located in Hikami District of Tanba Province (part of the modern-day city of Tanba, Hy≈çgo), where his father was a village headman. After the Meiji Restoration, he sought his fortune in Kumamoto Prefecture (1874), followed by Aichi Prefecture in 1875. Entering service of the police department, he was subsequently assigned to K≈çchi Prefecture, Kanagawa Prefecture and Saitama Prefecture. Around 1890, he came to the attention of Communications Minister Got≈ç Sh≈çjir≈ç, who recruited him into the central bureaucracy of the Meiji government. He rose to the position of vice minister, and concurrently served on the board of governors of the Japanese Government Railways. In 1898, he resigned from government service to accept an appointment as president of the Kansai Railway Company. He returned to government service in 1900 as Director of the Administration Bureau of the Communications Ministry, but resigned again only a year later to run for election to the Lower House of the Diet of Japan under the sponsorship of It≈ç Hirobumi and the Rikken Seiy≈´kai political party. He served for two non-consecutive terms, returning each time to a senior post within the Ministry of Communications. In 1906, he was appointed to the House of Peers, and the following year was made a baron (danshaku) within the kazoku peerage system. In politics, he became closely aligned with the faction under the conservative genr≈ç, Yamagata Aritomo, but later broke with Yamagata over issues pertaining to the Siemens scandal. Den was also one of the founders of the Kaishinsha Motorcar Works in 1914. The \\"D\\" in the company acronym \\"DAT\\" was from \\"Den\\". Later changed to \\"Datsun\\", the company was acquired by the Nissan zaibatsu in the 1930s. page 219 From 1916 to 1918, under Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake, Den was appointed Minister of Communications. During this period, he expressed concerns over the dominance of the United States and Great Britain over the new League of Nations, which contributed to an \\"encirclement\\" of Japan. page 234 In 1919, Den was appointed Governor-General of Taiwan, the first civilian to be appointed to that post. As Governor-General, he promoted new policies of social and political assimilation, wherein discriminatory laws in education were repealed. Several major reforms were carried out during Den's tenure, including various administrative reforms, expansion of the public education system, reduction of police involvement in local administration, construction of the Chanan Reservoir, and the legalization of Japanese-Taiwanese intermarriage. Den‚Äôs stated goal was that the Taiwanese populace was to eventually enjoy the same political rights as the Japanese in the Home Islands, and that the Taiwanese would be assimilated into normal Japanese society. page 108, 217 Business laws were eased to allow Taiwanese entrepreneurs to complete with Japanese, and several Taiwanese-owned newspapers were established. Under his tenure, then Crown Prince Hirohito made a state visit to Taiwan. Following the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake, Den was recalled to Japan, and asked to take the posts of Minister of Justice and Minister of Agriculture and Commerce in the 2nd Yamamoto Gonnohy≈çe administration. Together with Home Minister Got≈ç Shimpei, he laid the foundations for the reconstruction of Tokyo after the disaster. However, along with the rest of the cabinet, he was forced to resign in the aftermath of the Toranomon Incident. After 1925, he served as a member of the Privy Council. Den died of complications following an Intracranial hemorrhage in 1930 at his home in Setagaya, Tokyo. His grave is at the Tama Cemetery in Fuch≈´, Tokyo. Den kept a detailed diary from 1906 to his death in 1930, which forms an important source document for the history of politics during the Taish≈ç period of Japanese history.

He was assigned to the French colony of Saint-Domingue in 1789, where he married in Cap Fran√ßais, and acquired a plantation and 200 slaves before the Haitian Revolution. Following the Royal Navy's defeat of the French fleet in Saint-Domingue in 1793, de Grasse was allowed to resign his commission and leave with his family and in- laws for Charleston, South Carolina. There he and several fellow French colonial refugees joined the Freemasons in Charleston, forming a French chapter. In 1796 de Grasse was made a Director Inspector General of Freemasonry in Charleston; in 1801 he was among the eleven founders there of the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite. He was later chosen as Grand Marshal of the South Carolina Ancient Grand Lodge. De Grasse later returned to France after Napoleon came to power, and was able to resume his military career. He was also instrumental in founding new Scottish Rite councils in Paris and major European cities. In 1840 he published a biography of his father, Notice biographique sur l'amiral comte de Grasse d'apr√®s les documents in√©dits. It included reflections on his own life and experiences in Saint-Domingue and the United States. Life Alexandre Francois Auguste de Grasse, known as Auguste de Grasse, was baptized in St. Louis Parish, Versailles, France. He had a younger brother Maxime, who became a knight of Malta and died in 1773. He had four younger sisters: Am√©lie Rosalie Maxime, Ad√©laide, M√©lanie Veronique Maxime, and Silvie de Grasse. His father, Fran√ßois Joseph Paul de Grasse, also known as Comte de Grasse, was a career naval officer who helped rebuild the navy after France's defeat in the Seven Years' War. Their mother Antoinette Rosalie Accaron died young, after the birth of her last child. Their father married again, to Catherine Pien, widow of M. de Villeneuve.John Gilmary Shea, The Operations of the French Fleet Under the Count de Grasse in 1781-2: As Described in Two Contemporaneous Journals, Bradford Club, 1864, pp. 22-23 After Catherine's death, their father married for a third time, to Marie Delphine Lazare de Cibon, who survived him. France committed naval forces and other resources to support the rebels in the American Revolutionary War. Commanding the French fleet in the Battle of the Chesapeake, Admiral de Grasse became a hero of the war. His forces surprised the English fleet and defeated it, leading to the surrender by Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1781. But the next year, Admiral de Grasse suffered a defeat and was captured by the British in the Caribbean at the Battle of the Saintes. He was cleared of fault by a court martial in France. Military career The younger Auguste de Grasse had a career in the French army. After his father's death in 1788, he was assigned to the French colony of Saint-Domingue in 1789. His stepmother, Marie Delphine Lazare de Cibon (his father's third wife), and four sisters joined him in Saint-Domingue. They were fleeing the violence and disruption of the French Revolution. While stationed there, de Grasse married the daughter of Jean- Baptiste de La Hogue (also recorded as Delahogue). The young couple had a daughter who was born at Cap Fran√ßais. De Grasse acquired a large plantation and 200 slaves. In 1793 the Haitian Revolution was underway, and Great Britain attempted to intervene, hoping to get a toehold in the rich French colony. The Royal Navy defeated the French fleet at Saint-Domingue, and its commanders allowed French military officers to leave the island after they resigned their commissions. French forces and thousands of colonists left Saint-Domingue because of the violence of the Haitian Revolution. De Grasse lost all his property there, including the slaves. He and his family, including his father- in-law and mother-in-law de La Hogue, went to Charleston, South Carolina, along with numerous other French colonial refugees. They arrived on August 14, 1793, aboard the ship Thomas. The refugees were received by John B. Holmes and lived with him for some time at his residence, now 15 Meeting Street. In July 1794, de Grasse's four sisters traveled to Washington, D.C., via the ship Thorn to Boston. They solicited the American government in a claim for the war pension due their father and his estate, as they had become impoverished due to their father's death, followed by the French Revolution and its overturning of aristocratic families. Later the next year, Congress awarded the daughters annual pensions of one thousand dollars each in gratitude for their father's \\"extraordinary services\\" to the American cause. Also in 1794, de Grasse wrote to President George Washington pleading for assistance to survive since he and his family had been forced to leave Saint-Domingue. He noted that he and other officers had to resign their commissions in the French army in order to be permitted to leave.\\"To George Washington from Auguste de Grasse, 24 August 1793\\", Founders Online, National Archives; accessed 6 February 2018 No response is documented. After stopping at Washington, D.C., the sisters rejoined de Grasse and his family in Charleston. While living there, de Grasse had two of his daughters baptized, probably at St. Mary's Church. His youngest sister Silvie married M. Francis de Pau, also a French refugee from Saint- Domingue, and they settled in New York City. (She lived to January 5, 1855, age 83, and had two sons and five daughters.) In the summer of 1799, Ad√©laide died on August 23 and M√©lanie died September 19, both of yellow fever in the epidemic of that year. Both sisters were buried at St. Mary's Church in Charleston. Their sister Am√©lie never married and died years later. In 1798 de Grasse traveled to Saint-Domingue to offer his services to General Th√©odore- Joseph d'H√©douville, who had been sent to Saint-Domingue by the French Directory to try to divide the two leaders, Toussaint Louverture and Andr√© Rigaud, who controlled the island. De Grasse was captured, put in jail, and put in irons. The American Consul intervened, showing proof that de Grasse had become a naturalized American citizen. He was freed and put on the next ship to Charleston. By 1800 his father-in-law de La Hogue (who also became known as Delahogue) had established a school in Charleston, and added military classes. His ad in the City Gazette and the Advertiser (Charleston) on October 16 announced the following: > \\"Those persons who may desire their children to learn the principles of > Fortifications and Artillery will pay an additional price per month. He > [Delahogue] has made arrangements for this purpose with Mr. Auguste de > Grasse, his son-in-law.\\" De Grasse was also teaching in order to make a living. On January 10, 1801, he advertised in the Times paper in Charleston, announcing he had opened a new \\"Fencing Room\\" for classes, located at his house on Federal Street. Also listed were its hours of operation. Scottish Rite De Grasse's father-in- law Jean-Baptiste de La Hogue became a founder of a Masonic lodge named La Candeur at Charleston. The founding members were primarily French Roman Catholics, most of them refugees from Saint-Domingue or from the Revolution in France. On December 12, 1796, in Charleston, the Comte de Grasse-Tilly, along with his father-in-law de La Hogue and six other French refugees from Saint- Domingue, was issued a patent by Hyman Long making each man a Deputy Grand Inspector General (DGIG). This appointment was a title recognizing that the bearer was in possession of the secrets of the \\"Rite of the Royal Secret\\". After a fire destroyed the building at Church and Broad streets along with all the Masonic records, the lodge was temporarily inactive for some time. Long, born in the British colony of Jamaica, had gained qualification as a medical doctor and emigrated to New York City. He had received the appointment and right to appoint new DGIGs by Moses Cohen. Cohen in turn had received his appointment the year before from the American Barend M. Spitzer of Georgia.Baynard, Samuel Harrison, Jr. History of the Supreme Council, 33¬∞, Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, Northern Masonic Jurisdiction of the U.S.A. and its Antecedents, 2 vols.

The eight French emigres organized a Consistory of the 25th Degree, or \\"Princes of the Royal Secret.\\" By 1798 de Grasse was recorded as the Master of La Candeur Masonic Lodge in Charleston. On August 4, 1799, de Grasse demitted from Loge La Candeur. On August 10, he became a founder of Loge La R√©union Fran√ßaise at Charleston. A few years later in 1801, de Grasse and de La Hogue were among the eleven founders of the first Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite.Jackson, A.C.F. (1980). Rose Croix: A History of the Ancient and Accepted Rite for England and Wales (rev. ed. 1987) pp. 66-68. London: Lewis Masonic Publ. It was the Mother Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. All other Supreme Councils of the world derive their authority from it. De Grasse was appointed by the Council as Grand Marshal of the South Carolina Ancient Grand Lodge. 1802 *February 21 ‚Äì Brother de Grasse, Deputy Inspector General was appointed by the Supreme Council as the new Grand Inspector General, and Grand Commander of the French West Indies.

Later years De Grasse returned to France with his family after Napoleon came to power. He was allowed to re-enter the military. In 1816 he was asked to resign, at the age of 51. He continued his development work with Masons in France and across Europe. In March 1805 he established a Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite for Italy, based in Milan. In October 1809 he established a Supreme Council for Spain, based in Madrid. He was elected as the Grand Commander of the Supreme Council of France, a position he held until 1821, when he resigned. Disagreements had arisen starting in 1818, especially in relation to the Supreme Council of the Grand Orient. France eventually developed three Supreme Councils. De Grasse published a biography of his father in 1840, as Notice biographique sur l'amiral comte de Grasse d'apr√®s les documents in√©dits. In the book he also described his own journey to the New World, and his time in Cap Francais, Saint-Domingue; and Charleston, South Carolina, in the United States. He describes himself as being \\"76 years old, a worthy father, and after a life so full, he has reached old age without his rights to the gratitude of his country having ever been recognized.\\" He wrote that as military men, he and his father were both victims of political upheavals in France. On June 10, 1845, Count de Grasse, Alexandre Francois Auguste, Major, age 80, was registered at the Infirmary de l‚ÄôHotel des Invalides (Military Hospital) in Paris. He died around 12:30 AM of chronic bronchial pneumonia. References Further reading * G√©n√©alogie de la Maison de Grasse, Paris: Imprimerie de E.

It has provided the community with a radio and television service since 1963. History Modelled on the BBC, the Corporation was established in 1963 with the amalgamation of Gibraltar Television, a private company, and the Government-owned radio service, Radio Gibraltar which started regular broadcasting in 1958.Handbook of the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association, Secretariat, Commonwealth Broadcasting Association, 1988, page 83 Unlike the BBC, the majority of GBC's funding comes in the form of a grant from the Government. GBC did receive a small amount of income from the levying of a television licence fee. However, it was announced in Gibraltar's budget speech of 23 June 2006 that the TV licence was to be abolished. The board The activities of the corporation are controlled and governed by a board consisting of a chairman and not more than seven members appointed by the governor. Subject only to any directions of the Governor-in-Council the board is responsible for the corporation's policy. The corporation appoints a general manager and other staff to carry out its policies and the board is empowered to delegate any of their duties to their employees except responsibility for policy. Within GBC the board's powers are absolute. The chairman and board thus work through their permanent staff, headed by a general manager, who are responsible to the board. Although the chief concern of the board is undoubtedly broad policy, once laid down it is left to the general manager and senior staff, whom they appoint to carry out as trustees of the public interest in broadcasting. In view of their ultimate responsibility for everything that is broadcast, it is the board's duty to take an active interest not only in the programmes, but also in the financial and staff policies of the corporation. This is done through a number of sub- committees in which board members and senior staff participate in decisions relating to the treatment of political and public affairs, finance and development, and programmes. Only the House of Assembly has the power to change the ordinance and the Governor-in-Council the directions. Radio Gibraltar Radio Gibraltar broadcasts 24 hours a day and its programme format is similar to that of commercial local radio stations in the United Kingdom. The station operates on both FM and AM, broadcasting a mix of local programming in English and Spanish, and retransmissions of the BBC World Service. In December 2005, GBC started internet streaming of its radio service on the Internet, which, along with an up-to-date programme guide for GBC television and radio, can be found on the website. You can hear Radio Gibraltar live from 7 am to 8 pm on weekdays, after 8 pm the station plays continuous music through the night with only the brief interruption of Radio Gibraltar's jingle. On the station's AM frequencies BBC transmission can be heard through the night. On Weekends the station broadcasts live from 8 am to 9 pm with the same format. Radio Gibraltar's station is currently located at 18 South Barrack Road in Gibraltar's south district, after moving there in the 1980s from Wellington Front, its old location since its beginning in 1958. On Saturday 16 February 2008 Radio Gibraltar celebrated its 50th anniversary. To commemorate the occasion, past presenters were invited to co-host programmes in the slot which they once occupied, amongst them Peter Canessa, David Hoare, Norma Delgado, Gerry Martinez, Christine Dobinson and Richard Cartwright. During the week leading up to the anniversary, Radio Gibraltar broadcast interviews with former presenters who recalled their memories of Radio Gibraltar as well as on-air jingles from the past. One of the high points of Radio Gibraltar's history was that it served as a communications link between Gibraltar and the neighbouring communities in Spain during the closure of the land frontier, which divided families between 1969 and 1982. A special Roadshow live from Main Street was held on the anniversary. GBC TV showed a special programme to commemorate Radio Gibraltar's 50th anniversary which was celebrated during the week starting 18 February 2008. Radio Gibraltar programming Radio Gibraltar largely devotes its daytime hours to local news and current affairs, delivered through the flagship programme Focus, which has an AM, Lunchtime and PM edition. Outside the Focus News programmes, Radio Gibraltar's daytime hours are filled with magazine type shows that feature chat, games, competitions and phone-ins, and all is sandwiched in between \\"Classic Hits, Latest Songs\\" as per the station's slogan. Programmes include The Morning Show, The Afternoon Show and the long-running Spanish language programme Saludos which has anchored the 2-4 pm slot for over twenty years. The weekend schedule normally features personality-led shows alongside repeats from Radio Gibraltar's evening schedule, the UK Chart Show and a live transmission of Sunday Mass. Radio Gibraltar's evening schedule is mostly made up of one locally produced programme airing in the 7-8 pm slot. Programmes include; * Made in Gibraltar; A weekly series showcasing local musicians * Jazz Town; Playing the best smooth jazz every week, from everlasting names like Sinatra to the most recent stars such as Madeleine Peyroux * My Country; Playing the American Country Top 5 songs and featuring a brand new album every week * Yesterday When I was Young; Radio Gibraltar's golden oldies show playing songs from the 50s, 60s and 70s. This series is Radio Gibraltar's longest running series, having been on air for over 20 years. * Soundtrack of my life; Insight into local personalities and figures through music * Centre Stage; Another long-running series that plays a selection of songs from the biggest musicals ever to grace a stage. Radio Gibraltar also covers Community events such as National Day, sessions of Parliament, General Elections and others. It is also well known for organising Roadshows throughout the entire year, mainly organised around Charity events, Appeals, Awareness Campaigns and similar, culminating in the annual GBC / Radio Gibraltar Open day Charity fundraiser which takes place the week before Christmas. The station also carries a simulcast of the GBC TV programme Gibraltar Government Lottery Draw live every alternate Tuesday. Special programming usually takes over the news slots on Public Holidays, notably the 1 pm hour. Radio Gibraltar App On Monday 10 September 2012, coinciding with Gibraltar's National Day, a Radio Gibraltar App for the iPhone became available giving listeners a new way to listen to Radio Gibraltar on the go. GBC Television Prior to the 1990s, GBC TV was the only English-language channel available in Gibraltar. Launched as Gibraltar television in 1962, a privately owned commercial station, the broadcaster became the Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation a year later in 1963 when it became a public broadcaster funded by government. GTV, later GBC TV was first housed in Wellington Front, in what was commonly called Wellington Front Studios. Due to its location in Gibraltar, the area around Wellington Front usually floods during the rainy season. GBC often flooded and once this occurred during a live TV broadcast. In the late 70s GBC TV began experimenting with colour broadcasts. An all colour operation began in 1980 when GBC was relocated to 18 South Barrack Road into a building that is now called Broadcasting House. Broadcast hours and schedule  In its early days and until the 1990s, GBC TV offered viewers a mix of local production and international series, mainly imported from the BBC, ITV franchises and also from Canada and Australia. Broadcasting hours would be restricted to the evenings, with television normally being on air between 7 pm (later 6:30 pm) until shortly after midnight. GBC TV would also go on air during the daytime (normally for a couple of hours) from 3:30 pm during school holidays at Christmas. Typically TV broadcasts would begin with a PRD (Programme Run Down) which would air for a few minutes before giving way to a title sequence playing the GBC TV start-up theme and logo. Traditionally the programme line- up would be composed of children's programming between 6:30 pm and 7:30 pm. In the mid-1980s children's programming would take two slots, 6:30 pm ‚Äì 7 pm and 7:30 pm ‚Äì 8 pm with the decision to relay live the BBC Six O'clock News (7 pm in Gibraltar time). BBC News at Six was later dropped in favour of ITN bulletins. Local programing would usually air in the 8 pm slot and in later evening slots following the news bulletin. Imported series would usually air during Primetime and in the late night 11 pm slot. Feature films would traditionally air on Tuesday nights and Saturday nights under the Tuesday Movie and Saturday Movie banners. Local news Local news has occupied various slots, airing as late as 10:30 pm, and 9 pm before settling in the 8:30 pm slot, where it currently remains. On occasions, during the summer months, and prior to the introduction of the 11:30 pm News replay, news programmes would be scheduled at the later time of 9 pm to accommodate viewers' summer routines. Local news has been re-branded on air a number of times over the years. During the 80s it aired as Deadline. Currently local news on TV is branded as Newswatch, a brand introduced in the 90s. When GBC reporters travel outside of Gibraltar on assignment (notably the US and UK) they normally use the \\"GBC News\\" brand. Newswatch At present one news team produces news programming for both GBC TV and Radio Gibraltar. The Newswatch programme airs weekdays at 8:30 pm with a replay at the later time of 11 pm. It also streams live on www.gbc.gi and is also available next day after broadcast via the Watch Again player. No local news is produced or airs on TV or Radio at the weekend or on Public Holidays, unless events dictate differently. Newswatch has been using this composition for its openings, closings and stings for many years. News Headlines air weekdays at 8 pm with an approximate duration of 60 seconds. From 1 October 2012, as part of GBCs new autumn schedules, the Newswatch Headlines will move forward to 7:30 pm, airing immediately after the station goes on air, and will also incorporate the weather (previously independent at 7:30 pm) and the What's On (diary of events) feature. Newswatch is fronted by a number of newsreaders who work on rotation. Due to budget constraints, but taking full advantage of social media sites, local news is also updated via Twitter and Facebook. This was recently demonstrated when GBC recently provided Breaking News Coverage and News Updates of the ongoing British Waters incursions by Spanish Police (2012) and two Bomb Alerts (2012) via Social Media instead of opting for a traditional TV news update style broadcast. Viewpoint Viewpoint is the brand name for GBCs ongoing current affairs discussion series. The series has been running for a number of years and occupies the Thursday night slot that has traditionally accommodated most of GBCs past discussion series'. The programme's duration and frequency has been significantly reduced over the years; from a 90-minute weekly format to a 60-minute fortnightly one. The programme usually runs new series' between late September and early December, and continues after the Christmas break; from late January or February until late June, with a break in the spring coinciding with the Easter break. Viewpoint normally airs live and consists of a panel discussing community / political issues. In recent times the programme has become more participatory in nature by expanding on the traditional \\"Viewers Phone-in\\" and vox-pop to also include e-mails and comments made on social media sites. Until the cancellation of companion series, \\"Community Call\\" which dealt with social issues and topics, Viewpoint dealt exclusively with political issues. Viewpoint has a number of different presenters who work in rotation. Other news formats GBC News also produces Special reports and programming as required or dictated by events. These include interviews and addresses by politicians and community figures and special reports centring on specific news items. BBC and ITN News on GBC TV In the mid-1980s GBC TV decided to introduce international news into its schedules. Coinciding with the launch of the Six O'Clock News a few months earlier, GBC took the option to carry the bulletin. The programme aired live (at 7 pm due to the time difference with the UK) and in a simultaneous broadcast with BBC1. When greeting the audience, the BBC newsreader would acknowledge \\"viewers in Gibraltar\\" and also note the time difference. GBC TV also carried the BBCs flagship news broadcast the Nine O'Clock News. again this would air live and simultaneously with the BBC broadcast, but at the local time of 10 pm. Shorter 10-minute bulletins also aired on Saturdays and Bank holidays, although these were sometimes not aired live and were accommodated into the GBC TV schedule. In the late 1980s, ITN launched World News, a newscast which they produced for the new satellite TV channel Super Channel, which at the time was owned by all but one of the ITV companies. Coinciding with this, GBC TV opted to drop the BBC News bulletins in favour of ITN World News. Like with the BBC broadcasts, ITN provided two broadcasts; the first was a pre-recorded bulletin which aired at 7 pm Gibraltar Time and was a version produced for international syndication. The second aired at 10 pm Gibraltar Time and was the live broadcast produced for Super Channel. The GBC Open Day The GBC Open Day is an annual fund-raiser event that has grown from year to year. Launched in (date), the annual event started out as a fundraiser event to financially support the annual Three King's Cavalcade and also to buy Christmas gifts for the least well off children in the community. Originally, the event would encompass a number of fundraising initiatives that took place on the day of the Open Day itself, but over the years this has grown, and now a number of fundraisers are held throughout the year with monies being presented at the Open Day on the day of broadcast. The GBC Open Day normally takes place a week before Christmas Day, always on a Wednesday. The event starts on radio Gibraltar at 9 am, and continues on radio until 7 pm. GBC Television normally takes over, starting their televised version of the event after the news bulletin, from 9 pm till the early hours. The Radio Gibraltar part of the Open Day is composed of a Roadshow, normally held at John Mackintosh Square, with the public being invited to go down and donate money in exchange for a Christmas greeting and a musical dedication. Over the years, further aspects were introduced into the Radio format such as the annual \\"Villancicos\\" contest (Christmas Carol contest) where businesses and workplaces were invited to write and perform their own take on popular songs and carols. The TV version of the Open Day can be described as a traditional Tele-thon, complete with entertainment, live music, comedy, variety, cheque presentations, competitions and an auction. The Television Open Day also includes parodies of local events over the last year, and a \\"Reward\\" segment previously titled \\"Surprise\\" where individuals within the community are prized for their contribution, strength and sacrifices. Previously the TV version also featured the annual \\"Treasure Hunt\\" with live links throughout the broadcast on the progress made by participants. This disappeared over time despite being one of the most popular aspects of the TV Open Day, albeit being revived in the last few years as a pre-recorded segment. Today, the GBC Open Day is a local charity which raises monies for a variety of local charities. It remains one of the highlights in the Gibraltarian Social Calendar, with most of the community participating and contributing in some way.

Screened mostly throughout the 1980s, the soap was a Sunday night staple and usually followed The Sunday Message religious broadcast. Whilst it is standard scheduling practice today, GBC TVs scheduling of The Sullivans during the 1980s was well ahead of its day, with the broadcaster opting to air two episodes back-to-back on Sunday nights, editing out the closing credits of the first episode and the opening sequence for the second to create a seamless hour-long episode instead of two half-hour instalments. Sadly GBC TV never completed the 1,114 episode run of the series, cutting it off shortly after surpassing the 1000 episode mark as a result of its decision to drop all imports from its schedules. Local viewers never saw the conclusion of the series until satellite TV arrived in Gibraltar and golden oldies channel UK Gold screened the entire run. *Jupiter Moon ‚Äì With EastEnders having become too expensive for the GBC, the channel opted to replace the series with a new British soap from British Satellite Broadcasting, Jupiter Moon, debuting it before its launch on the BSB's own Galaxy Channel. That series aired on GBC three times a week, normally on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. *Movies, Games and Videos Local programme titles *\\"The Magic garden / Playground\\" *\\"Susan's Corner\\" *\\"3 to 6\\" *\\"Brain Box\\" *Top Team *\\"City Talk\\" *\\"Snippets\\" *\\"Soundchaser\\" *\\"Storyliners\\" *\\"A Walk through History\\" *\\"Girl Chat\\" *\\"From the Archives\\" *\\"Smarty Pants\\", *\\"Taboo\\", *\\"9 o'clock shop\\", *\\"Community Call\\" *\\"Sunday Message\\" *\\"Live from The Rock\\" *\\"Two's Company\\" *\\"The Mag\\" *\\"Telespree\\" *\\"Sports Report\\" *\\"Telebingo\\" *\\"The Quiz\\" *\\"The Bland Travel Game\\" *\\"The Thursday Debate\\" *\\"Music Street\\" *\\"PLU ‚Äì People Like Us\\" *\\"Abstractus\\" *\\"Cultural Exchange\\" *\\"The Lamplighters\\" *\\"Sweet Somethings\\" *\\"Summer Rendez-vous\\" *\\"Health Matters\\" *\\"Just Another Day\\" *\\"Vicki's Kitchen\\" *\\"Flavours of the 1001 Nights\\" *\\"News Review\\" *\\"Support\\" *\\"Postcards from the Past\\" *\\"Diversity\\" *\\"Andrea's Kind of folk\\" Early 1990s ‚Äì Satellite TV arrives With the arrival of satellite TV to Gibraltar, GBC TV decided to compete with a Microwave Distribution System MMDS which carried the BBC TV Europe service. Due to difficulties in securing the rights to rebroadcast other channels and propagation problems, the service was terminated. GBC started relaying BBC Prime on its VHF and UHF channels with opt-outs.Handbook - Commonwealth Broadcasting Association, Secretariat, Commonwealth Broadcasting Association, 1997, page 59 In the early 1990s this comprised the BBC programming throughout the day with GBC TV productions screening in appointed \\"windows\\", such as the NewsWatch programme at 8:30 pm. The BBC service was re-encrypted with decoders supplied to licence holders free of charge. This rebroadcasting ended in 1999 when GBC ceased BBC transmission in favour of a relaunch which would see the channel broadcasting its own output between 7:30 pm and 11:30 pm. The 1999 relaunch The BBC 1992 made-for- television movie An Ungentlemanly Act spearheaded the GBC 1999 schedules on Relaunch Night. As part of the 1999 relaunch, GBC TV acquired the broadcast rights to various international TV series and Made for TV movies. Titles included the British action series Bodyguards, the Australian dramedy SeaChange, the Australian medical drama All Saints, the British romantic dramedy Cold Feet (screened under the Foreign Markets title \\"Life, Love and Everything Else\\"), reruns of classic Western drama Bonanza, the Canadian police drama Cold Squad; and factual series, \\"Hutan: Wildlife of the Malaysian Rainforest\\", Movies, Games and Videos, Cybernet, Adventure and discovery, Reel Adventures and \\"Sportsworx\\". GBC TV also \\"fills\\" its schedules with random episodes of music shows \\"London Live\\" \\"Legends of Jazz\\" and \\"The album Show\\". At present most \\"scripted fare\\" has disappeared from GBC TV schedules, and in its place the channel screens various lifestyle and travel programmes such as \\"Inside Luxury Travel\\" and various Country profile / promotional programmes. GBC experiment: Latin American telenovelas In 1999, GBC TV piloted the screening of a Spanish-language programme in their late night slot (10:30 pm). Flor de Oro, a Colombian telenovela was the first Spanish language serial to air on the channel. It ran for 65 episodes and had a replay the next day at 2 pm. Following the conclusion of the serial, GBC TV launched a second telenovela, 90-60-90 Modelos, this time opting not to include it in its nightly transmissions and only maintaining it in its 2 pm slot. When the serial finished, GBC ended its Spanish-language television programming and restricted Spanish broadcasts to radio (Radio Gibraltar) in its traditional 2 pm ‚Äì 4 pm slot. Early 2000s Current The television service also broadcasts 24 hours a day with the programme profile favouring the inclusion of local productions, including news and current affairs programmes. GBC TV programming airs daily between 7:30 pm and 11:30 pm, with the rest of its transmission hours being taken up by an Information Service which provides local information as well as from time to time broadcasting TV programme replays and programming from the channel's archives. Local television shows airing on GBC TV include: * Newswatch ‚Äì the channel's flagship news bulletin which airs every weekday at 8:30 pm and replayed at 11 pm. * Talk About Town ‚Äì A discussion series in Llanito (the local vernacular) in which three presenters discuss local affairs, from the need to replace a street sign to important political affairs. * Viewpoint ‚Äì The flagship political discussion show. * Pepe's Pot ‚Äì Culinary series in Llanito in which presenter Pepe Palmero teaches viewers how to prepare local favourites. The series ended after five seasons in 2006. Revived in 2012. * Sports Report ‚Äì Long-running local sports review type show * Telebingo ‚Äì Long-running local gameshow hosted by local presenter David Hoare and then Andy Coumbe, based on the traditional bingo game. The gameshow ended on 25 July 2007. * In Him I Trust ‚Äì Long- running religious magazine show GBC TV also screens religious, music, history and children's programmes as well as many specials which cover events held in the local community. The majority of GBC's output is imported, particularly from the UK, US and Australia. These are unavailable for streaming on GBC's website due to copyright. As has been the trend worldwide, GBC TV has also added a few reality shows to their line-up in recent years. The first reality series to air on the GBC was Let's Dance, a take on the BBCs Strictly Come Dancing contest. In the GBC version, various local personalities competed in a weekly competition that run for four weeks. A second series followed, as did a third in Spring 2009. January 2007 saw the launch of GBC's new reality contest ‚Äì Weekend Warrior in which two teams of local personalities battled it out against each other in a recruit training type competition. GBC daytime hours Over the years, GBC TV has mostly been on air exclusively during the evenings with a few exceptions ‚Äì holiday programming for children at Christmas and live broadcasts of community and news events. However, daytime hours were normally handed over to a number of Advertistment formats, most notably the EYE service during the 1980s. The EYE service can be compared to an on-screen revolving Teletext format which consisted of Community Information, Diary of Events, competitions and advertisements. Radio Gibraltar provided the audio for the EYE service. The service ceased when GBC TV opted to relay BBC broadcasts. After the 1999 relaunch, GBC TV announced it would incorporate Daytime transmissions as a way of extending broadcast hours and subsequently increasing advertising time available to potential advertiseres. Initially, as a pilot-scheme, the service replayed a Spanish language telenovela that aired weeknights at 10:30 pm, but the plan was to extend this to include a news magazine show during the lunch-hour and a Community notice-board type magazine show. There was talk of taking to TV the popular radio news format Focus at Luchtime. This never materialised. At present, GBC TV fills daytime hours with a cheaper version of the old EYE format. The new service currently rotates a few ads with Community information, Diary of events, notices and Government Notices. Old photographs of Gibraltar donated by local photographers and collectors also feature, alongside photo portfolios from amateur photographers and Photography competition winners. Portfolios feature for months and are refreshed randomly. Like with the EYE service, Radio Gibraltar provides an audio stream for the service. GBC on-screen branding =Logo and DOG= GBC on-screen branding and corporate identity have changed a number of times throughout its history. The iconic circle set against the backdrop of a computer animation of the Rock of Gibraltar was used throughout the 80s. During the 90s, coinciding with GBC limiting its service and handing over most of its broadcast hours to retransmissions of the BBC Europe channel, a new logo was introduced. Designed locally, the new logo featured a broken silhouette of the Rock of Gibraltar against a white background and red letters depicting the GBC TV name. After the 1999 relaunch, GBC again rebranded to an earlier version of the current logo which is depicted by a \\"silver-coloured wavy impression\\" of the silhouette of the Rock of Gibraltar. It also features \\"Gibraltar sunshine\\" represented by a yellow coloured Sun emerging from behind the Rock, and the Mediterranean Sea depicted by a \\"blue-coloured wavy\\" which also serves to underline the GBC red-coloured letters. Recently GBC has opted for a reworking of the current logo, which uses silver colours against a blue background. The new logo is solely made up of a \\"silver coloured wavy\\" depiction of the silhouette of the Rock against a blue background and the GBC lettering now in a silver colour. The reworked version is currently appearing in the Newswatch titles, and corporate idents. The GBC website has not updated or changed the logo to the reworked version. The old logo with red lettering is still being used as the station's DOG. =Idents= GBC has introduced Gibraltar-themed idents during 2012. During April 2012, for the first time, across London, in three different places, 55 soldiers of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment were responsible for the security and for providing the Queen's Guard at Buckingham Palace, St James Palace and the Tower of London, and guarding the Crown Jewels. GBC commemorated the historical occasion with a number of idents depicting the Royal Gibraltar Regiment duties in London. These idents also served to launch GBCs new style idents which have continued since. To date, there are a number of idents. Most depict Gibraltar landscapes, streets, buildings, monuments, institutions and everyday Gibraltar life. These idents are refreshed frequently and are in constant rotation. There are also \\"themed\\" and \\"commemorative\\" idents depicting \\"seasons\\" and occasions. Summer idents have depicted Gibraltar beaches, the Sea and Gibraltar's summer lifestyle. Commemorative idents have depicted the Golden Jubilee, National Day, and the London 2012 Olypipcs (the first with Gibraltarian participation). New idents are planned for Autumn 2012 to coincide with GBCs new programme schedule which will see an increase in local programming. =GBC branding theme and scores= GBCs branding theme has been changed over the years. During the 70s and 80s GBC used a powerful orchestral type theme which was very much in line with TV station branding of the time. Over the years and in keeping with changing styles, GBC has opted for a number of smoother sounding themes. At present, GBC uses a smooth, inspirational-type track as its brand theme. GBC themes and programme scores are not exclusively produced for GBC TV as is the case with Radio Gibraltar jingles, and are instead bought from royalty-free music sites. At present the GBC brand theme is also being used as the programme theme for a factual series made by a Spanish TV channel. The future of GBC In summer 2007, the Gibraltar Social Democrats (GSD) announced that if they were to be re-elected in that year's elections, they would review broadcasting in Gibraltar and GBC TV and Radio would undergo a major overhaul in 2008. The GSD was then subsequently re-elected in 2007 for a further term. It has been said that the government would consider privatising in full or in part broadcasting in Gibraltar. During a function held to celebrate Radio Gibraltar's 50th anniversary, Chief Minister Peter Caruana announced that the planned review of GBC and broadcasting in Gibraltar would take place before the end of 2008. As at June 2009, the government had confirmed that a full review of GBC TV and Radio was completed earlier in the year. During a session in Parliament, when asked by the Opposition, the government announced that they had no \\"immediate plans\\" to reveal details of the survey. They further added that the GBC review is \\"no major priority\\". 2010: Allan King and \\"The Way Forward\\" On 2 February 2010, the Government of Gibraltar published a paper detailing the future of GBC. Entitled The Way Forward, the paper was based on the various recommendations made by media personality and consultant, Allan King (formerly of the UK's Sky TV), in a report commissioned by the government. King's report was dated November 2008 and entitled \\"Preparing GBC for the next 50 years\\". Following the release of the paper, the government opened a period of public consultation that ran for six weeks on the future of broadcasting in Gibraltar. The paper recommended that GBC TV and Radio Gibraltar close up one day at midnight, and re-open the next day at 6 am as a completely \\"New GBC\\" with a brand new logo, slogan, feel and programme schedule. The paper looked at different areas and stresses the importance attached to providing better facilities, technical equipment, staff development and better management in order for broadcasting to move forward and survive. The paper states that there should be more local special interest programming, in-depth documentary series, one-off programmes and local \\"magazine\\" programmes separate from news programmes. It states that there is little justification for many of the current \\"bought-in\\" programmes as they do not relate to Gibraltar, and are simply a cheap way of filling airtime. GBC's raison d'√™tre is its service to Gibraltar, i.e. its public service broadcasting function. There could be justification for some bought-in programmes where there is genuine local interest (providing they are cost- effective), and for films. The paper also mentions the need to rebalance frequency use in Gibraltar, as the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) has a large share for its small audience. A second channel could be used for special events or even be leased out in programming block format such as the breakfast television franchise GMTV which operates via ITV in the UK. The Way Forward also recommends that GBC take up the role of cable television operator to provide a new revenue stream for the broadcaster. On radio, King stated that Radio Gibraltar tries to cater for too wide an audience, and recommends launching a second radio station, one for a general audience with news and current affairs at its heart, with the second service targeting a younger audience. The King report initiated some debate in Gibraltar. Meanwhile, Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Peter Caruana, has proposed to the GBC board that Allan King be appointed the broadcaster's first chief executive officer. In late March 2010, the Board of GBC appointed Allan King as the broadcaster's first CEO for a term of three years. King began his employment with GBC on 7 April 2010. As of July 2011, no major changes had been seen in GBC's TV broadcasting, albeit a reformatting of its daily news programme, to shorten it substantially, and follow it with a 'magazine' style programme. In early 2012, Radio Gibraltar has replaced its jingle with one that mirrors those in the UK. GBC's current situation is unknown. Broadcasting Act 2012 The Broadcasting Act 2012 will replace the Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation Act 1963 (GBC Act). It will transpose several EU directives on broadcasting into Gibraltarian law. Under its provisions, GBC will continue to be a public service broadcaster offering free-to-air transmissions to the whole community. Its remit will continue to be to inform, educate and entertain. A bill for the Broadcasting Act 2012 was published as a supplement to the Gibraltar Gazette in August 2012. The Gibraltar Parliament passed the Broadcasting Act 2012 on Friday 28 September 2012, which replaced the GBC Act. It was passed by Government majority, with the Opposition voting against, as it felt there were a number of technical objections which meant they could not support it. The Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo, said the new Act ends the GBC's monopoly on broadcasting and introduces a regulatory structure for all broadcasting in Gibraltar. GBC becomes a joint-venture and the creation of the GEN (Gibraltar Entertainment Network) Gibraltar Entertainment Network, a company formed in Gibraltar with well-known UK television writer Kim Fuller amongst its directors was part of the arrangement pursued by the Gibraltar Government to try to give the local public service broadcaster GBC a fresh start. Best known for his work on Not the Nine O'Clock News, Red Dwarf and Spitting Image, Mr Fuller will be one of the directors of the new joint venture company involving GBC in an arms-length deal. Another of the directors will be Anna George whose partner was Led Zeppelin's manager, as well as that of Bad Company, Maggie Bell and the Yardbirds. An agreement was signed late August 2012 with Rightful Media, a company which includes several directors who are also directors in another Gibraltar headquartered company, Personalbest, and include Andrew Smith, Non Executive chairman and with considerable experience in global asset management for leading entities, media sales manager Brendan Golt, Anna George and Trudi Faulkner the Operations Director. The new commercial arrangements will see the corporation owning a 50 percent share in the Gibraltar Entertainment Network (GEN), and developing new built-for-purpose studio complexes at Europa Point, possibly by 2015. A music recording studio will also be set up. There may also be cross-over opportunities for GBC staff at the GEN. GEN, and the new GBC, will not be fully operational for some time yet, as the estimate time of completion for the construction projects has been set at the end of 2015. GBC will, however, be relocating to the Ince's Hall Complex which will undergo extensive works to accommodate the broadcaster. The Chief Minister of Gibraltar Fabian Picardo reiterated that the future of GBC must lie away from public funding. The new business model will see GBC teaming up with a UK entertainment company, Rightful Media to co-own the Gibraltar Entertainment Network, and taking advantage of Gibraltar's beneficial tax status to attract major productions to film and record in Gibraltar. Autumn / Winter 2012 schedule: Local programming increased In October 2012, GBC launched a new autumn schedule which saw a substantial increase in local programming. The new schedule included Stuff About Us, a brand new entertainment/variety magazine show that is on Friday nights. A new fortnightly community chat show fronted by female personalities, Women Unleashed alternates with Viewpoint on Thursdays, taking over a niche left vacant by the cancellation of Talk About Town. Other programmes include an adventure-style programme Living on the Edge; The Property programme which looks at Gibraltar's most impressive homes and the local property market; a new gastronomy programme, uCook, and a new religious programme, Questions of Faith, replacing the cancelled long-running series In Him I Trust. As part of the schedule revamp, most GBC programmes play three times over a seven-day period. Long-running programmes Sports Report, News Review and Viewpoint continue to feature in the new schedule, as does the weeknightly Newswatch and the chat show Diversity. Some new international series will also feature in the new schedule, including Australian police drama Stingers and movie nights. =Autumn 2012 programmes= Local productions (September‚ÄìDecember 2012 / Cycle 1) * Sports Report ‚Äì Weekly round-up of local sports events (on-going series) * Diversity ‚Äì Chat show with local personalities and visitors (programme 13 ended series one; aired 22 October) * Viewpoint ‚Äì Fortnightly discussion series focusing on political issues (on-going series). * News Review ‚Äì Weekly local news review series (on- going series). * Gibraltar Government Lottery Draw Live ‚Äì Fortnightly broadcast of the local lottery (on-going series). * Stuff About Us ‚Äì Friday night entertainment magazine show which airs live; includes guests, music, features and competitions. * Living on the Edge ‚Äì Adventure-type series in which a local personality/presenter takes on challenges such as bungee jumping and sky-diving.

Digital switch-over The Gibraltar Regulatory Authority (GRA) signed a contract worth around $1.5 million with Arqiva in the United Kingdom to provide a digital broadcasting network in Gibraltar. The network comprises two digital television multiplexes and two digital radio multiplexes. On each television multiplex Gibraltar is be able to transmit up to six distinct programmes. Each digital radio multiplex allows for four distinct programmes. The transmitters are located at a single site on the Upper Rock, thus minimising the environmental impact of the antenna and support structures, which will replace the two television broadcasting sites of Signal Hill and O'Hara's Battery. The digital broadcasting network had to be operational by 31 December 2012, allowing Gibraltar to meet its international obligation to cease its analogue television transmissions by that date. The contractor, Arqiva, provides much of the infrastructure behind television, radio, satellite and wireless communications in the UK. Proposal for relocation to Queen's Cinema and Hotel After the GSLP/Liberal Alliance's victory to a second term in office, Chief Minister Fabian Picardo stated that GBC is to be relocated to the old premises of the Queen's Cinema, which will be redeveloped as Gibraltar's national theatre, and administered by GBC.

GRA is one of the most important roads in Rome, and traffic reaches 160,000 vehicles per day as of 2011. The GRA features 14 tunnels, with lengths varying from the 66 meters of Parco di Veio II tunnel to the 1,150 meters of the Appia Antica tunnel as well as eight rest areas. It has 42 junctions, with the Via Aurelia numbered 1 and the rest following clockwise. The motorway has always been toll-free. However, there are plans to introduce a fee for vehicles entering the GRA from highways. Maintenance costs are around 11 million per year. Its acronym was given after one of its main designers and supporters, Eugenio Gra, chairman of ANAS, the Italian roads Authority, at the time of construction. The official number among the Italian motorways is A90, but is widely known by Romans as Il Raccordo (\\"The Junction\\").  History  Location in Italy Plans for an orbital road around Rome were proposed by the end of World War II. One of the designers' main purposes was to build the road as most equally distant as possible from the geographic centre of town, the Campidoglio, away from the motorway. Construction works started in 1948. The first section, Flaminia to Tiburtina (north-to-east section) opened in 1952, later extended in stages. The last section to be opened was the west-to-north section (Aurelia to Flaminia), in 1970. Although the GRA was initially planned and built as a single-carriageway road, it was soon clear that traffic was rapidly growing well beyond the expectations. Upgrade works to motorway standards started in late 1950s with first dual-carriageway, four-lane section (Salaria to Tuscolana) opened 1962. Further works were carried over throughout the 1970s, and by 1979, the remainder sections were upgraded to four-lane and the entire ring classified as toll-free highway. Upgrade works to 6-lane started in 1983 and were completed in stages throughout the 1990s and 2000s. As of April 2008 97% of the GRA was 6-lane with final sections (new tunnel under Via Cassia) opened 2011. Future expansion It has been suggested that a second ring might be constructed in the future,L'ANAS vuole un secondo Raccordo Anulare (in Italian) firstly as an attempt to alleviate congestion on the old one and secondly to offer access to a number of new industrial, commercial and residential zones built around it. Such a project would imply a new external ring-shaped orbital motorway of about , denominated NIA (Nuova infrastruttura anulare, \\"New ring infrastructure\\"), which would cost over ‚Ç¨5 billion.  In popular culture  The road was the subject of the 2013 documentary film Sacro GRA which won the Golden Lion at the 70th Venice International Film Festival.

The centre was opened in late 1997 and is the second multi-story shopping centre in northern Queensland. The shopping centre is built over the Cairns Railway Station, which is incorporated with the centre. Pedestrian access to the station is through the car park on the bottom floor, or a pedestrian walkway on the second floor. Construction of the shopping centre was delayed temporarily due to damage suffered from Tropical Cyclone Justin in early 1997. Cairns Central contains three department stores (Myer, Kmart & Target) one supermarket (Coles) and a six cinema complex. The centre is jointly owned by Lend Lease, owners of other Australian shopping centres such as Sunshine Plaza and Canelands Central and The Westfield Group.

Professional wrestling career Jovica made his professional wrestling debut in 1971, working primarily in the Canadian Stampede Wrestling promotion. By 1974 he had relocated to Puerto Rico where he, along with Carlos Col√≥n and V√≠ctor Qui√±ones, founded Capitol Sports Promotions (later renamed World Wrestling Council; WWC). In December 1976, Jovica and tag team partner Hercules Ayala won the NWA North American Tag Team Championship (Puerto Rico/WWC version) from Heigo Hamaguchi and Gordon Nelson. They held it for 21 days before losing it to Los Super M√©dicos (Super M√©dico I and Super M√©dico II).

Three days later the NWA Championship commission announced that the title change had been over turned as they declared that Jovica has his feet on the rope during the pin and thus Jovica was never officially a champion. This was a common tactic used in the days when the NWA champion was a traveling champion, allowing the local contender to look good, send the fans home happy and then allow the recognized champion to continue to tour.

They had one self-titled album that was originally released in 1971, and later re-released in 2003. The album credits kept an aura of mystery about their membership. Martin Cure, Graham Amos, Terry Howells and Alan Savage were actually involved. Career Bassist Graham Amos and vocalist Martin Cure began their musical experience in 1963 in a Coventry based band called The Sabres. They later formed The Peeps in 1965. The other two members of the band were Roy Albrighton (guitar) and Paul Wilkinson (drums). The Peeps recorded five SPs for Philips Records (1966‚Äì68). In 1968, they recruited Terry Howells on organ (ex-Ray King Soul Band). Their drummer, P. Wilkinson, left the band in 1968 (he joined a band called Flying Machine). With a new drummer, Gordon Reed (ex-Vampires), the group's name was changed to Rainbows. They recorded two singles for CBS Records. The Rainbows also had some gigs in Hamburg, Germany, and when they were finished there their guitarist, R. Albrighton, decided to stay in Germany (later, he formed a band called Nektar). When Rainbows came back to England, Reed left the band. The three remaining musicians: Amos, Cure, and Howells, changed a band name to Still Life. Alan Savage was recruited at short notice prior to the new line-up recording their debut album. It was recorded at Nova Sound Recording Studios, near Marble Arch, London. Savage was involved with the recording on the following dates: 1, 2, 5, 6 and 13 October 1970. The album was mixed on 26 October. Stephen Shane produced the album, which was released through Vertigo Records. The Allmusic journalist, Richie Unterberger, noted \\"The record was early organ-dominated progressive rock, its lyrical themes dwelling upon uneasy doubt and sadness, the melodies colored with the gothic classicism prevalent in much of the genre during the period\\". The band had a recording contract to produce six such albums, but they drifted apart. After the split Amos was living in England, but he died in June 2003. Howells now lives in Switzerland, and in April 2012 recorded a solo album, Tangerine Puddles. The album is solo piano, with all composition by Howells. Savage lives in Northampton, and still plays the drums. Martin Cure joined Cupid's Inspiration in 1971, and in 1980, he and his friends from Cupid's Inspiration formed a group called Chevy. In 1981, they had a record deal with Avatar Records and recorded one album and three singles. In 1983, Cure played with the group Red on Red. He now has his own PA company but still does occasional gigs with Cupid's Inspiration and The Rouges.

Administratively, it is incorporated as a town of oblast significance. It also serves as an administrative center of Khmilnyk Raion, one of the 27 districts of the oblast. Population: The town is situated in the upper part of the river Southern Bug, northeast of Vinnytsia. It is one of the oldest towns of Podillia. History Early history The town was first mentioned in writing in 1362. Prince Algirdas gathered a large army for the Battle of Blue Waters, in which he defeated Kotlubug, Kachubej, and Dmytro, who owned Podillia. The town includes an island which served as a hiding place for raiders during the Tatar invasions. This island was called Khmilnyk for the hop plants which grew there in abundance; in Ukrainian, \\"khmilnyk\\" means hop garden). Khmilnyk is situated not far from \\"Black Way\\", the road often used by Tatar armies. Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth In 1434, Khmilnyk became part of Poland's Khmilnyk district of Podillia province. After the town obtained Magdeburg rights in 1448, different crafts and trade grew. Poland considered Khmilnyk to be an advance post of its possessions, so the town was strengthened. In 1534, the Polish king fortified the town with a stone wall with towers and a castle. After the Brest union in 1596, oppression of the local inhabitants grew, which caused rebellions against the gentry. In 1594, Khmilnyk was captured by Cossack detachments of Severyn Nalyvajko. In 1637, the Cossacks returned with Pavlyuk as their leader. In the period of the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648‚Äì1654), rebellious detachments of Khmilnyk people joined the army of Bohdan Khmelnytsky. Maksym Kryvonis captured the castle. More than once, the town was the site of battles between Cossacks and gentry armies. As a result, the town was devastated. In 1672‚Äì1699, Khmilnyk was held by the Turks. They fortified the castle, built a mosque, and made secret passages. Endless battles between Turks and Poles resulted in the decay of commerce, and the town's population shrank. In 1699, Khmilnyk was recaptured by Poland. Russian Empire period Khmilnyk coat of arms in Russian period In 1793, Khmilnyk and Podillya towns were captured by the Russian Empire. After the formation of Bratslav province on 22 May 1795, Khmilnyk became one of its district towns, and the coat of arms was consolidated into it on 22 January 1796. In 1797 Catherine II presented Khmilnyk and its districts, with a population of 6,070 people, to Count Bezborodko. On June 9, 1804, Khmilnyk became part of the Litinsky Uyezd of Podolia Governorate and remained in this position until the October Revolution (1917). There were four Orthodox churches there until 1910. With industrial development, the town population grew, and in 1915 Khmilnyk had 18,300 people. In 1878, a weaving mill was founded, and in 1905, a brewery, sawmill and iron foundry began operations. There were 1616 craftsmen, which included 470 seamstresses, 250 tailors and 230 furriers. At the beginning of the twentieth century Khmilnyk had undergone social changes. The economic decay of 1907-1910 was interspersed some economic revivals. In 1911, there were 22 enterprises and 67 different workshops dealing with processing the products of cattle-breeding, woodwork, and metal, and many independent craftsmen. In the 1920s, Soviet authorities settled in Khmilnyk to control the population and discourage intellectuals. Churches were closed down. In the 1930s, Khmilnyk became a resort. World War II and killing of over 11,743 innocent people Bridge in Venetian style Khmilnyk was devastated in World War II. In June 1941 the front came close to Khmilnyk, and on 16 July 1941, the German army captured the town. The Jewish population of the occupied town was decimated in a violent genocide. On two bloody Fridays (9 and 16 January 1942), German divisions slaughtered more than 8,000 of the town's inhabitants. In Khmilnyk a total of 11,743 innocent victims were shot to death. To commemorate this, a monument was erected and a service held on 19 August 1988, at the massacre site.memorial monumentArchives of the Ghetto Fighters' House, Photos Nos. 56066-7 On 18 July 2002, the Memorial to the Victims of Nazism was opened in Khmilnyk. The relatives of the victims collected the funds to build this Memorial. The Memorial was built by Mr. Isaak Mikhailovich Abovich, born on 29 June 1937. His uncle, niece, grandmother, three cousins and other relatives are buried there. He has dedicated his life to building and preserving the Memorial and the Jewish Cemetery in Khmelnyk. Mr. Abovich has also organized the construction of two memorials to the victims of the World War II at the Jewish Cemetery in Khmelnyk. He is in charge of maintaining the Jewish Cemetery. He is the only remaining Jew in Khmelnyk, the town where the majority of the population were Jewish before the beginning of World War II. While the Ukrainian \\"police\\" assisted the Gestapo in killing the victims, the Memorial includes the recognition of the efforts of to the Ukrainian people who helped the Jews during the German Nazi occupation at the risks of being killed with their families. On 18 February 1944, after the battle near Korsun-Shevchenkivskyi, the 1st Ukrainian Front was assigned the Proskuriv-Chernivtsi operation, which was decisive for the liberation of the town and whole district. On the morning of 10 March 1944, soldiers of 71st and 276th divisions captured the left part of Khmilnyk and the Mazurivka and Sydoryha settlements. After violent fights on 18 March 1944 the town and district were liberated from German invaders. Current regional languages Ukrainian and Russian languages are spoken throughout Ukraine. However, Ukrainian language is spoken in Khmilnyk region and westward. The Dnieper river divides the east from the west. On the western side of the Dnieper river you will find that people speak Ukrainian and Russian within context and the further west you go the stronger Ukrainian language is spoken. Ukrainian language differs from the Russian language in many aspects. They pronounce words much different and the alphabet of the Ukrainian language has different alpha symbols than the Russian. Many Russian speaking Ukrainians and Russian speaking Jews either died or left Khmelnyk. Many people from nearby villages moved in and they generally speak Ukrainian. Today, Ukrainian is generally spoken in Khmelnyk. Famous resort town In 1934, scientists found radon water while searching for drinking water in Khmilnyk. Since 1970, Khmilnyk has been a spa resort town of some importance. Khmilnyk is a modern balneological resort with seven health centres. It has the capacity to treat 50,000 from Ukraine and other countries every year. The main medicinal factor at the resort is radon water. The radon water is formed during circulation of water through granites of the Ukrainian crystal shield. Twin towns Khmilnyk is twinned with: * Busko-Zdr√≥j, Poland * Szczawnica, Poland Culture and architecture Ascension Church in Khmilnyk Khmilnyk has several architectural and historical monuments. Saint Trinity Church was built in 1603 and restored in 1729. Four Orthodox churches were built between 1801 and 1910. The city has a Turkish mosque and the palace of K.I. Ksido. Monuments to Bogdan Khmelnitsky were built to commemorate his leadership in the liberation war of the Ukrainian people against Polish social and religious oppression (1648‚Äì1654). There is a red granite statue of Lenin, seated; the statue sits on the top of a hill overlooking the town centre. There is a monument to soldiers who died during the Great Patriotic War, the Glory Monument to War Heroes, and an obelisk to soldiers of 18th Army, 71st and 276th divisions that liberated Khmilnyk in March 1944. In 1991 a monument to Taras Shevchenko was built. Holy Trinity Church Catholic cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Khmilnyk Holy Trinity Church was built in 1603. During the time of the Tatars occupation (1672‚Äì1699) it was ruined. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, the church was repaired, and in 1728 it was sanctified a second time. The church is a four-pillar basilica in the Toscana baroque style. Side niches are joined by cross-like cranes and the central niche has a semicircle crane. During the 1930s and 1940s, the church was twice closed by communists. A blacksmith's shop was opened at the altar and prisoners worked there. In the 1970s, the central entrance to the church yard was closed due to widening of the road. Now the central gates are situated on the other side. When the weather is fine, everybody in Khmilnyk can hear the ringing of the bells, recently donated to the church by the Polish government. Castle tower and secret passages Tower fortress In the center of Khmilnyk, above the river, an eight sided building with loopholes and counterforts can be seen. This is the only preserved castle tower out of the six that were built. In 1534, the king fortified the castle against numerous attacks from the Turks and the Tatars. The castle was built on a man-made hill and town was surrounded with stone walls. A channel dug between the South Bug and Tasthusha rivers turned the town and fort into an island. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648‚Äì1654, the castle was devastated by Cossacks. From 1672 to 1699, the castle was owned by Turks. They strengthened the defensive buildings, built a mosque and secret passages passing under the river and leading to the outskirts of the city. Some of the passages were later abandoned, used as storehouses, and part was made into a nightclub. The section that passed under the river has since collapsed, and flooded. Only a small part is now accessible from the –°—Ç–∞—Ä–∞ –§–æ—Ä—Ç—Ä–µ—Ü—è (Stara Fortretsia - \\"old fortress\\") Restaurant located directly under the castle. In the eighteenth century, the castle lost its defensive function and was gradually ruined. The preserved mosque tower was restored many times, and between 1804-1917 it was turned into an Orthodox Church. Palace of K. I. Ksido Palace of K. I. Ksido Near the castle tower is a building that at first sight seems to be old. This is the palace of the local landlord K. I. Ksido. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he initiated a project to construct a large palace and park complex according to a design by the Russian architect Ivan Fomin, but it was not finished. The complex consists of the palace and an arc-like Venice bridge over the river. The palace is an example of neoclassical architecture uniting the forms of Renaissance and Classicism. The building has two floors, and is quadratic, with towers on the main fa√ßade and corners. There was a dome rotunda on the roof but it was knocked off by a Soviet air attack during World War II. From 1920 to 1964, the building was used for agronomic and electronic schools, storehouses, a mill, and several different establishments. Since 1964 it has been used as a hotel. Now, the building is in very poor condition, and needs major repairs.

Located at three kilometers from the state highway SH-4 from Vinnamangalam (via Nadupattu nad Kudisaikarai), in between Arni and Chetput. The neighboring villages are Periya Kozhappalur, Kudisaikarai, Vinayakapuram, Melanur, Thirumani, Katteri (Gengapuram), and Nariyambadi. Most of the villagers are rice farmers and fewer government employees. The village is located on the Cheyyar River bank, which originates from Jawadhu hills near Chengam and later joins in Palar River at Walajabath. Due to limited ground water availability, farmers are changing their cultivation method to \\"deep borewell\\" instead of traditional wells. Lake irrigation system is almost stopped these days. The existing two lakes' total area is shrinking day by day and government is yet to take any action even after giving many complaints. Recent monsoon rain made the farmers to cheer but again the ground water level has gone below the average level. Agricultural activities are going down again. There were many hand-loom silk weavers, weaving silk sarees for Arni, Kancheepuram Silk, but these days no one is weaving due to less remuneration and health issues. Classes conducted to the children at Konaiyur Panchayat Union School. Village total population is around 1,800. The literacy level is not much satisfactory. But in recent days, all the young boys and girls are performing well in school education.

He lived in the time of Demosthenes, whose anti- Macedonian policy he enthusiastically supported. In 343 BC, he was one of the ambassadors sent to Macedonia to discuss, amongst other matters, the restoration of the island of Halonnesus, which had been seized by king Philip of Macedonia. The mission was unsuccessful, but soon afterwards Philip wrote to Athens, offering to resign possession of the island or to submit to arbitration the question of ownership. In reply to this letter the oration De Halonneso was delivered, which, although included among the speeches of Demosthenes, is generally considered to be by Hegesippus. Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Plutarch, however, favour the authorship of Demosthenes. The Middle Comedy poet Crobylus is sometimes \\"confounded\\" with Hegesippus.

It has the appearance of a tiny, living human doll, up to 12 cm in length. Others have said they are living mummies measuring in between 15 and 20 cm. They have long hair which grows sparse and stiff through the legs, and long nails. It is sometimes said that they were formerly human beings. They have also been called vampires. Jenglots began to appear in the community in 1997. However, Syed Abdullah Al-Attas says they first originated in 1972 (highly disputed). Whereabouts Jenglots are said to be found in Indonesia, especially in Java. They are mostly found by psychics after they have performed a supernatural ceremony. Jenglots can be found in any terrain, from under the ground, on a wrecked house roof, and even in the trunk of a huge tree. Feeding Jenglot Jenglot 'keepers' feed their creature with blood, either animal blood (goat) or human blood. The blood is placed near the jenglot, which is said not to drink the blood directly. According to traditional belief, the jenglot will get the nutrients of the blood in their own way. Exhibition In Indonesia there has been several \\"exhibitions\\" of jenglot specimens found and showcased. Most being found on the islands of Java and Sumatra, and are held as private collections of supernatural researchers and fans. Many were found to be hoaxes, being masterful taxidermist fixings of monkeys and fish, however, not all specimens were examined, and the jenglot is an actively believed myth that many natives believe to be real. People who have caught the jenglot usually bring their creature all over Indonesia to exhibit them in order to gain some money. They have also been shown at Pameran Misteri, Jin, Hantu dan Keranda at Sultan Alam Shah Museum, Shah Alam. Others still maintain that they are no more than \\"man-made toys [with] no supernatural power.\\" In 2008, scientists in Malaysia examined hairs and DNA from four jengelots brought from Irian Jaya, Indonesia to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia by a 'businessman' to be exhibited in a local museum. Each of the samples appeared to be from humans and DNA analysis showed it was likely from the same person. They even noted that \\"A few hairs from samples [...] also had an intact dried root at the other end of the cut tip, which indicated that the hairs were implanted upside down on the Jenglots‚Äô heads\\". Becoming a Jenglot According to an Indonesian legend, Jenglot was an ascetic who wanted to learn the \\"Ilmu Bethara Karang\\" or the way to eternal life. It also said to be a hermit who worships demons and gains a certain power and ability. They say if a person with great supernatural power meditates in a certain cave, they'll become jenglot.

It was constructed in two separate stages. The first consisted of a hall and tower which was designed by William J. Ellis and built in 1873. Between 1887 and 1890 a new stage designed by George Johnson was added to this comprising municipal offices, a police station and a courthouse as well as extensions to the hall. The clock tower added at this time replaced the original tower.

Krakowiak rhythm on score. The Krakowiak or Cracovienne is a fast, syncopated Polish folk dance in duple time from the region of Krak√≥w and Lesser Poland. The folk outfit worn for the dance has become the national costume of Poland, most notably, the rogatywka peaked hat with peacock feathers. It became a popular ballroom dance in Vienna (\\"Krakauer\\") and Paris (\\"Cracovienne\\") where, with the polonaise and the mazurka, it signalled a Romantic sensibility of sympathy towards a picturesque, distant and oppressed nation. In Russia a krakowiak was featured in Mikhail Glinka's A Life for the Tsar (1836) and, ever since, became an identifiable symbol of Poles and Polish culture in the Russian Empire, especially due to the rogatywka hat. The first printed Krakowiak appeared in Franciszek Mirecki's album for the piano, \\"Krakowiaks Offered to the Women of Poland\\" (Warsaw, 1816). Fr√©d√©ric Chopin produced a bravura concert krakowiak in his Grand Rondeau de Concert, Rondo √† la Krakowiak in F major for piano and orchestra (Op. 14, 1828). The last movement of his first piano concerto also draws heavily on the dance. In terms of its choreography, the krakowiak is set for several couples, among whom the leading male dancer sings and indicates the steps. According to the description in the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, the krakowiak is directed by the leading man from the first pair. As they approach the band, \\"the man, tapping his heels or dancing a few steps, sings a melody from an established repertory with newly improvised words addressed to his partner. The band follows the melody, and the couples move off in file and form a circle (with the leading couple back at the band).

The cognitive revolution in psychology. New York: Guilford Press (pp. 126‚Äì252, ‚ÄúJames J. Jenkins: Beyond methodolatry‚Äù) Trained as an industrial psychologist, his early career was shaped by his Fellowship at the Social Science Research Council‚Äôs 1953 summer meeting that established the discipline of psycholinguistics.Osgood, C. E., & Sebeok, T. A. (1954). Psycholinguistics: A survey of theory and research problems, Supplement to the International Journal of American Linguistics, 20, (4). Reprinted by Indiana University Press, 1969. He initially attempted to apply a modified version of behaviorism to the problems of language behavior, and while his ‚Äúmediational‚Äù approach was very influential, he became convinced that it could not provide an adequate account of the structural nature of language as articulated by Noam Chomsky.Jenkins, J. J., & Palermo, D. S. (1965). Mediation processes and the acquisition of linguistic structure. In U. Bellugi and R. W. Brown (Eds), The acquisition of language.

Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. pp. 347‚Äì359. He continued research on language and cognition, eventually focusing on topics concerning speech perception (in collaboration with his wife, Winifred Strange). His research was marked by an interest in new and even radical ideas (e.g., those advocated by James J. Gibson), a keen appreciation of the value of studying real-world problems (as in his early research on aphasiaSchuell, H., Jenkins, J. J., & Jimenez-Pabon, E. (1964). The problem of aphasia in adults: Diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. New York: Hoeber.), and a willingness to give up cherished theories when the facts drove him to do so.Jenkins, J. J. (1974). Remember that old theory of memory? Well, forget it! American Psychologist, 29, 785‚Äì795. \\"If you're not making any progress toward understanding the problem,\\" he said, \\"you've got to change.\\" He had an infectious enthusiasm for both research and teaching, and his impact on young psychologists was tremendous.

D., & Franks, J. J. (1971). The abstraction of linguistic ideas. Cognitive Psychology, 3, 193‚Äì209.).  Academic career  Jenkins enlisted in the Army in 1942 and was trained as a meteorologist, receiving a B.S. in physics from the University of Chicago in 1944. After serving as a weatherman in the Army Air Forces in the U.S and the South Pacific, he returned to William Jewell College to earn an A.B. in psychology in 1947. He then earned a Ph.D. in psychology at the University of Minnesota in 1950, studying industrial psychology under Donald G. Paterson (who trained even more Ph.D.‚Äôs in his career than Jenkins did). He remained at the University of Minnesota as a professor in the Psychology Department from 1950 to 1982. From 1965 to 1973, he was founding Director of the newly established Center for Research in Human Learning of the University of Minnesota, where he remained as Director of Training until 1982. In that year, he moved to the University of South Florida, first as Chair of the Department of Psychology, and then as Distinguished Research Professor until he became Emeritus in 2000. He served as an Adjunct Research Professor at the City University of New York from 2000 through 2008. He was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in 1957‚Äì58 and 1964‚Äì65 (where he and a group of distinguished scholars ended a night-long celebration of their year together by attempting to watch the sun rise over the Pacific Ocean), and a Visiting Professor at the University of Colorado, Yale University, and the City University of New York.  Honors and professional activities  Jenkins is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Psychological Society/Association for Psychological Science, the American Psychological Association and the Acoustical Society of America. He is a member of the Society of Experimental Psychologists and the Psychonomic Society, the Midwestern and Southeastern Psychological Associations, the Southern Society for Philosophy and Psychology, and the International Society for Ecological Psychology. He served as Chairman of the Society of Experimental Psychologists (1972‚Äì73), Chairman of the Psychonomic Society Board of Governors (1978‚Äì79), Chairman of the Board of Scientific Affairs of the American Psychological Association (1969‚Äì1971), President of the Midwestern Psychological Association (1967‚Äì68), President of Division 3 (Experimental) of the American Psychological Association (1973‚Äì74), among other contributions to professional societies. He was Consulting Editor, Associate Editor, or Editor of several major professional journals and member of several NIH and NIE grant panels, member of the National Research Council for four years, and Chairman of the Social Science Research Council Committee on Linguistics and Psychology (1960‚Äì1962). His academic honors include the previously mentioned Fellowships at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and the Social Science Research Council Fellowship at the seminal 1953 Social Science Research Council Summer Institute in Psycholinguistics, as well as an SSRC Faculty Fellowship, a Ford Foundation Faculty Grant, a Citation for Achievement from William Jewell College (1968), a Phi Kappa Phi (University of South Florida Chapter) Artist/Scholar Award (1985), a Sigma Xi (USF Chapter) Outstanding Research Award (1987), and an Outstanding Alumni Achievement Award from the University of Minnesota (2001).All information taken from http://psychology.usf.edu/faculty/data/jjenkins_cv.pdf and sources cited in footnotes 1, 7, and 9.

It is developed and regulated by MapInfo Corporation as a proprietary format. File components The basic file components for a MapInfo Professional data set relate to the two basic environments for working in MapInfo; \\"Browser View\\" and \\"Mapper View\\". As with most other GIS packages, several files are required to allow the user to open a data set for viewing within MapInfo Professional. The most basic view would be the browser view only. This environment provides storage of attribute or object data and is represented like a spreadsheet. In this simplified scenario, no geographic information is available. Minimum files required for the basic MapInfo Professional browser environment: *.TAB (The ASCII file that is the link between all other files and holds information about the type of data set file ) *.DAT (The file that stores the attribute data. This is a dBase III DBF file) As an alternative to the *.DAT file, MapInfo Professional can use other data formats such as, *.TXT, *.XLS *.WK*, *.MDB (and for each Microsoft Access format the software also makes another small file). MapInfo Professional still creates a .TAB file that contains information about the data set file, and the user interacts with the TAB file only. There may also be a third file: *.IND (Optional index file for tabular data. This is present if any columns are indexed). To view geographic information (the graphic representation of data) in MapInfo Professional, two additional files are required and added to the basic requirements for simply viewing data. Minimum files required to view a map with the data previously discussed: *.MAP (Stores the graphic and geographic information needed to display each vector feature on a map) *.ID (Stores information linking graphic data to the database information. This contains a 4-byte integer index into the MAP file for each feature). Each time a *.MAP file is saved by MapInfo Professional its objects are sorted into a storage sequence based on an R-tree spatial index. This optimises the read process of streaming data from disk to screen, at the cost of a relatively slow write process. So the basic file set for viewing data and its graphic representation in vector form within MapInfo Professional requires a minimum of four files, normally the *.TAB, *.MAP, *.DAT and *.ID. If there is only textual information with no graphic objects, then a minimum of two files is needed: *.TAB and *.DAT. While a data set is being edited by a user, temporary files are created by MapInfo Professional. The presence of any of these files locks the data set and prevents it from being edited by any other users. When the changes are saved, the temporary files are deleted by the software. In certain situations such as a power failure while editing is in progress, the temporary files may not be deleted and the changes will be lost. In this case the files should be manually deleted. Normal temporary files have the following file name extensions: *.TDA Temporary database file *.TIN Temporary index file *.TMA Temporary Map File When using a database table such as Oracle Locator or Spatial, if the data is downloaded to the local machine, the temporary file name extensions are: *.LDA Local Temporary database file *.LIN Local Temporary index file *.LMA Local Temporary Map File MapInfo Professional can also use raster images and grid surfaces as layers in a map. These are stored in their native file formats, such as *.JPG, *.TIF or *.PNG, and the software again creates a *.TAB file for each one which includes georeferencing information. A seamless table enables a single layer in a map to be derived from multiple base data sets, such as a mosaic of raster image tiles. When MapInfo Professional creates a seamless table it makes a simple vector layer which contains a rectangle for each base data set with attribute data defining the file path to the files containing the base data. When the seamless table is opened, metadata in its *.TAB file causes the map to display not the rectangles but the contents of the base tables in their place.

Most models in the MuVo range use flash memory for storing data; the only exceptions being the MuVo¬≤ and MuVo¬≤ FM models which use microdrives. The distinguishing feature of the range, beginning with the original MuVo and carried on to newer models, is that the players are split into two unequal parts. The smaller part functions as the audio player, bearing all of the controls, inputs and outputs, internal microphone, and a male USB-A plug. The larger part has a female USB-A receptacle, and holds one AAA battery: this provides power to the player. The player/flash drive section is a USB mass storage device, therefore it requires no drivers on most operating systems. Data files, as well as audio files, can be stored on the flash memory, therefore the player can also be used as a USB flash drive. However, players like the MuVo¬≤, MuVo¬≤ FM, MuVo¬≤ XT, MuVo Slim, and the MuVo Vidz are an exception. The MuVo N200 looks like a typical MuVo player, but the two unequal parts are merged and inseparable. Many, but not all, models also include an internal microphone allowing the device to be used as a low-quality audio recorder. The MuVo line was discontinued in 2009.

It runs from the station of Drei Annen Hohne at , where it joins the Harz Railway, via Schierke and the Bode River valley to the summit of the Brocken the highest mountain of the Harz at and part of the Harz National Park.  Route  99 7243 The Brocken Railway leaves Drei Annen Hohne station (), like the Harz Railway, in a southwesterly direction. As it leaves the station, however, it crosses the road to Schierke/Elend and then enters the Harz National Park. It then heads west to Schierke station (688 m), where until 1963, there was a siding to Knaupsholz granite quarry at about the half-way point. The line then runs for some distance along the valley of the Cold Bode, which lies south and far below the line. Next the 971 m high mountain, the Wurmberg, appears on the left, and the train crosses the Brocken Road for the first time. After a tight left hand bend before the Eckerloch Bridge and another right-hander, the line reaches Goetheweg station (956 m), which is now only used as a locomotive depot. Then the line runs directly to the Brocken, encircling it in a spiral 1 ¬Ω times, during which it crosses the Brocken Road again, and then finally ends after 18.9 km at Brocken station (1,125 m).  History  K√∂nigsberg, around 1900 Railway passage in the wall encompassing the Brocken summit, September 1990 As early as 1869 there was a design for the construction of a railway to the Brocken, but it was turned down. A resubmission in 1895 succeeded, however, and, on 30 May 1896, the construction permit was issued once Prince Otto of Stolberg-Wernigerode had allocated the requisite land. The first section of the Brocken Railway, from Drei Annen Hohne to Schierke, was opened on 20 June 1898 and construction work for the remaining section up to the Brocken was begun on 4 October 1898. Initially services to the Brocken only ran between 30 April to 15 October; during the winter trains terminated at Schierke station. At the end of the Second World War significant damage occurred to the track, mainly through bombs and artillery shells, in the course of fighting in the Harz, which had been declared a fortress. The section to the Brocken was only reopened, therefore, in 1949. The operator of the Brocken Railway until 5 August 1948 was the Nordhausen-Wernigerode Railway Company (NWE), after which it belonged from the Association of Publicly Owned Companies (VVB), part of Saxony-Anhalt's transport services, and, from 11 April 1949 to the Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany. Only after the German winter sports championships in 1950, which took place in Schierke, did winter trains run up to the Brocken summit. A railway station at Eckerloch was also built for the championships which was closed again after they had ended. The location of the former sidings at Eckerloch station can still be easily seen. Goods trains continued to work the Brocken Railway right up to 1987, although since the construction of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961 the Brocken and its station had been part of the out-of-bounds area and thus not accessible to the public. Up to that time the trains transported coal, oil and building materials up the mountain for the East German Border Troops and Soviet soldiers who were stationed there. Passengers services on the Brocken Railway continued to run from Drei Annen Hohne to Schierke; usually only two pairs of passenger train pairs ran each day;Various railway timetables. however they could be used with only a special pass, because Schierke lay in the border zone with West Germany. After German reunification the continued operation of the Brocken Railway was initially called into question, however united efforts by railway enthusiasts and politicians under the overall control of the then state Minister for the Economy, Horst Rehberger, helped to give the Brocken Railway a second chance. The German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) was also involved, because the Brocken Railway was needed to haul away the obsolete, military facilities on the Brocken. On 15 September 1991, after being renovated, the Brocken Railway was ceremoniously opened to the public with two steam-hauled trains. The trains were headed by locomotive no. 99 5903, a Mallet locomotive, which had been procured by the NWE in 1897/98, and locomotive no. 99 6001, a prototype developed in 1939 by the firm of Krupp. Since the privatisation of the narrow gauge lines in the Harz in 1993 the Brocken Railway has been operated by the Harz Narrow Gauges Railways (HSB). The steam trains on the Brocken Railway have become popular with thousands of tourists every year, offering convenient access to the top of the Brocken.  Current operations  Video of the Brocken Railway in operation (2013). Up to six pairs of trains run daily to the top of the Brocken during the winter. Of those, four start and end in Wernigerode. During the summer, services are increased to eleven pairs of trains daily. The fastest train takes 49 minutes to reach the summit. The Brocken Railway is the only HSB line whose regular services are exclusively hauled by steam locomotives (specials are also hauled by diesel railbuses and diesel engines of Class 199.8, the latter for clearing snow).

She was the daughter of contrabass player Baruch Culp and his wife Sara Cohen. At the age of seven she began to practice the violin, and at 11 had her first public violin performance. Her first performance as a singer was on 30 December 1893. In the summer of 1896, she left Groningen for Amsterdam, where she studied at the Conservatory under renowned former opera singer Corn√©lie van Zanten. Soon after completing her studies in 1900, Culp's singing career took flight. She was discovered by German-American conductor Wilhelm Berger, who took her to Berlin to perform at the concert hall Saal Bechstein in 1901. Before long, she was performing all over Europe and America, sharing the stage with such notable composers, conductors and singers as Edvard Grieg, Richard Strauss, Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, Enrico Caruso, Otto Klemperer, Willem Mengelberg, Pablo Casals, Percy Grainger, Enrique Granados and Thomas Beecham. As early as 1902 she performed for Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and in 1903 she was invited to sing at the German Imperial Court for Empress Augusta Victoria. In 1911 Culp sang the mezzo-soprano part in the premiere performance of Frederick Delius's Songs of Sunset in London under Thomas Beecham. In 1913, she made her American debut at Carnegie Hall in New York City. In the United States, she soon became known as the \\"Dutch Nightingale\\". Julia Culp made some 90 acoustic recordings between 1906 and 1926. In the United States, she made 41 recordings for the Victor label in the years 1914‚Äì17 and in 1924. In July 1926 she made her only electric recordings, in Berlin.Potter T. Ladies of low repute - Part 6. Classical Recordings Quarterly, Summer 2014, No 77, p33-34. She married Erich Merten on 29 June 1905 and settled in Zehlendorff near Berlin. However, the marriage was unsuccessful and they divorced in 1918. In the meantime, she had met a Czech industrialist, Wilhelm Ginzkey (1856 - 1934), and they married on 23 July 1919. At that time, she converted from Judaism to Catholicism, ended her singing career and moved to Vienna. Julia remained married to Ginzkey until his death in 1934. In the meantime, the Nazis had come to power in Germany. After the German annexation (Anschluss) of Austria in 1938, Culp fled to the Netherlands, moving in with her sister Betsy in Amsterdam. When the Nazis invaded and occupied The Netherlands in 1940, Culp once again found herself in grave danger. Both she and her sister went into hiding and managed to survive the war. They returned to their flat on the Dani√´l Willinkplein (Victorieplein) in Amsterdam, where she remained until her death at age 90.

The base closed on 25 September 1995, pursuant to the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990 (10 U.S.C. Sec. 2687 note) and the recommendations of the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission. It is now a civilian airport and industrial complex, operated by the Plattsburgh Air Base Development Authority. The airfield is now known as Plattsburgh International Airport. Geography The former air base is bordered by the city of Plattsburgh and the Saranac River to the north and the Salmon River to the south. It lies on the western shore of Lake Champlain on the New York-Vermont border. History Military Presence Before the Base Plattsburgh was the third oldest military post in the United States. The U.S. has maintained a military presence at the site of the now closed base since 30 December 1814. In particular: * On 30 December 1814, the Federal Government purchased 200 acres for the construction of the \\"Plattsburgh Barracks\\". * In 1838, additional parcels of land were acquired and stone barracks were built to house the personnel. * During the Civil War, Union troops organized and departed from the base. * During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the 21st Infantry was transferred from Plattsburgh Barracks to Cuba in June 1898. The troops returned to Plattsburgh in September 1898. * During the Interwar period, Plattsburgh Barracks was the home of the 26th Infantry Regiment of the \\"Iron first \\" division. * In 1944, it was turned over to the Navy and became \\"Camp MacDonough\\", an indoctrination school for officers. * After the war, from March 1946 to 1953, the base was used for college student housing for area colleges and extensions schools. Plattsburgh Air Force Base (PAFB) In 1953, the site returned to the Federal government and Plattsburgh Barracks were renamed Plattsburgh Air Force Base. The Air Force held a ground breaking ceremony for the new strategic base on 29 January 1954, and construction began immediately. The runway was completed and the first aircraft landed on 7 November 1955. However, operational facilities were not completed until 1956 due to several work stoppages and severe winter weather. F-4D Phantom IIs from the 134th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the Vermont Air National Guard at Plattsburgh AFB Built during the Cold War, Plattsburgh AFB's runway is large enough to land the space shuttle. It was on a list of alternate landing sites for the space shuttle. Space shuttle Columbia astronaut Michael P. Anderson, born at Plattsburgh AFB, was an Air Force pilot at Plattsburgh AFB when he got selected by NASA in 1994.

During the period 1961 and 1963, 12 \\"Atlas F\\" missile sites were constructed within a 50-mile radius of the base, thus giving the 380th the capability to launch 12 missiles. All sites were in New York state, except for two located on the other side of Lake Champlain in Vermont. The 556th Strategic Missile Squadron, formerly assigned to Dow AFB, Maine, was transferred to Plattsburgh AFB on 1 October 1961, and became completely operational on 20 December 1962. It was inactivated on 25 June 1965. =BRACC 1991 and closure= Governor Mario Cuomo speaking at a rally in favor of keeping the base During the 1991 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRACC) deliberations, PAFB wound up being pitted against Loring AFB in Limestone, Maine. The people of Maine put up a brief fight but, at the end, PAFB was spared. Two years later, when BRACC reconvened for another round of closures, PAFB, along with McGuire AFB in New Jersey and Griffiss AFB in Rome, New York, were considered for closing. The local sentiment was that, again, PAFB will be spared mainly because the United States Air Force had plans to transform the base to a major Strategic Air Command base for the Northeast, expanding to add more aircraft and personnel. It was a hard battle. Rallies were held and a local leadership group, dubbed Team Plattsburgh, was put together to save the base. Testimonies were held, before several BRACC members, to keep PAFB open and give it the intended expansion. At the end, McGuire AFB won over PAFB. Plattsburgh AFB was officially closed on 30 September 1995, as a result of the 1993 Defense Closure and Realignment actions. The closure ceremony took place on Sept.29, 1995. Current status Operating tables being taken out of the old base hospital, in the Double Cantilever Hangar Plattsburgh Airbase Redevelopment Corporation (PARC), led by the nationally known planner, David Holmes, was created to manage the property. Holmes had overseen the redevelopment plan which included a mixed- use solution to overcome the economic shortfall that occurred when the military moved out. Uses included Aviation, Biotechnology, Industrial and Recreation. Ultimately, PARC split up the base into 165 parcels for redevelopment. While community leaders feared in 1995, at the time of the actual closure, that the North Country's economy would collapse, this did not turn out to be the case; the base actually only accounted for $42 million in economic impact (about 8 percent of the local economy) because it was so isolated. It was anticipated that it would take 20 years to replace the impact. But in 1996, Dave Werlin of Great Northeast productions and PARC's Director of Planning, Nate Sears, devised a way to make up $30 million in 3 days. On 16 and 17 August 1996, PARC hosted a massive music concert on the runway of the old decommissioned airbase by the band Phish. The concert, known as The Clifford Ball, was attended by 70,000 people , and added $30 million to the local economy. The concert was the largest Rock Concert in North America in 1996 and drew attention from The New York Times, MTV and numerous news media world-wide. The concert was possible due to a coalition of entities, including the New York State Police, County Sherriff, City of Plattsburgh, CVPH Medical Center, the Clinton County Health Department and numerous other private and public organizations. Although Phish wanted to return, PARC's Board of Directors decline in a 6-1 vote and subsequent Phish concerts were held at the former Loring Air Force Base in Limestone, Maine, where they generated $25 million and $40 million for the local community, respectively in 1997 and 1998. As of 2016, PARC tenants on former airbase properties include: *Wood Group *Pratt & Whitney Industrial Turbine Services *Sikorsky *UPS Air Freight *FedEx Air Freight * PrimeLink * Gradient etc. The site also hosts a number of specialty services on site including acres of parks, trails and playing fields as well as an 18-hole golf course, a day care center and a gym. On the original Military Reservation, on the shores of Lake Champlain, is the Old Base Museum Campus. There are five museums within 200 feet of each other - the Clinton County Historical Museum, the Air Force Base Museum, the Champlain Valley Transportation Museum, the Kids' Station Children's Museum and the War of 1812 Museum, all housed in former military buildings. Included on the Museum Campus are edifices built in the 1890s including Officers' Row, the old Headquarter's Building and the old firestation. The historic district around the Oval parade ground saw General Leonard Wood's founding of the Plattsburg Idea, a training program started to prepare officers for duty in WWI. There is also a Memorial Chapel, the Clyde A. Lewis Air Park, and the Old Post Cemetery, in which a Spanish American War Medal of Honor recipient is buried. Two of the original structures built just after the War of 1812 are still on Campus - the Old Stone Barracks and the original powder magazine. The U.S. Air Force lists Plattsburgh among its BRAC \\"success stories.\\" The base's reuse and the circumstances surrounding it were chronicled in Flying High Again: PARC's Redevelopment of Plattsburgh Air Force Base, written by Marian Calabro and published by CorporateHistory.net in 2008. Environmental problems It is designated a military superfund site. Historically, site contaminants originally included volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including trichloroethene (TCE), dichloroethene (DCE), and vinyl chloride, fuel-related compounds (mainly benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene), pesticides, various metals including chromium and cadmium, and lead and munitions waste from an old small arms range and an explosive ordnance demolition range. As stated in others sections of this site profile, most of the formerly contaminated areas have been cleaned up. In addition to groundwater contamination, other potential exposures included direct contact with and ingestion of contaminants found in soil. The only known remaining soil contamination at the former base is at the landfills, which have been capped and are fenced off.https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/dsp_ssppSiteData2.cfm?id=0202439#Risk Additional potential risk to human health exists due to soil vapor intrusion (SVI) into buildings by VOCs. However, this contaminant pathway has been extensively studied across the entire base, mainly in association with the FT-002 / Industrial Area Groundwater OU. Soil vapor extraction (SVE) systems were installed at 3 buildings in the industrial area of the base where concentrations of VOCs warranted mitigation and/or remediation. In addition, a large portion of the base is covered by a LUC/IC for SVI that requires either mitigation of risk or sampling and evaluation of risk prior to the construction of new buildings or modifications to or change in use of existing buildings. Any sampling and risk evaluations conducted would be reviewed by the Air Force and regulatory agencies, and continued monitoring or mitigation, as necessary, would be required. Affected property owners must also certify compliance annually with the Air Force, which also conducts annual LUC/IC inspections.

Under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 14132, \\"Congress authorized the FBI to create a national index of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples taken from convicted offenders, crime scenes and victims of crime, and unidentified human remains.\\" In response to this congressional mandate, the FBI established the Combined DNA Index System (\\"CODIS\\"). The CODIS database provides a means for state and local forensic laboratories to share DNA profiles in an attempt to \\"link evidence from crime scenes for which there are no suspects to DNA samples of convicted offenders on file in the system.\\" However, the 1994 Act was interpreted by the FBI to permit only the creation of the CODIS, not the taking of DNA samples of persons convicted of federal offenses for input into the system. Thus, \\"the FBI requested that Congress enact statutory authority to allow the taking of DNA samples from persons committing Federal crimes of violence, robbery, and burglary, or similar crimes in the District of Columbia or while in the military, and authorizing them to be included in CODIS.\\" Accordingly, Congress passed the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 (\\"DNA Act\\"), 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 14135 et seq., which authorizes the \\"Attorney General to make grants to eligible States... to carry out, for the inclusion in the Combined DNA Index System of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, DNA analyses of samples taken from individuals convicted of a qualifying State offenses.\\" 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 14135(a)(1).

It connects U.S. Highway 98 in Destin to State Road 20 in Niceville. The bridge generally runs north-south; the approaches to the bridge carry the State Road 293 designation while the bridge itself carries the TOLL 293 shield. The bridge crosses Choctawhatchee Bay, part of the Intracoastal Waterway. It was constructed in 1992-93, when the Florida Department of Transportation recognized the growing need for a more direct route between the Destin beaches and the mainland for tourists and to assist hurricane evacuation from population centers and resorts on the Gulf of Mexico. http://www.mid-bay.com/about-us-2/mid-bay-bridge/ There is one toll plaza at the north end of the bridge. As of October 1, 2015, the one way toll for a standard 2-axle vehicle was $4.00 with cash, and $3.00 with the SunPass electronic toll system.http://www.mid-bay.com/toll-information/bridge-toll- schedule-3/ Spence Parkway The Spence Parkway is an, 11-mile, limited access, 2-lane, separately tolled highway that connects the north end of the Mid-Bay Bridge with SR 85 immediately north of Niceville, Florida. Interchanges at SR 85, SR 285, Forest Road and SR 20 allow easy access from Interstate 10 to Niceville, Destin, Miramar Beach, and communities East of Niceville along SR 20. The new Parkway provides considerably shorter travel times by avoiding 13 traffic signals along the previous route through Niceville on SR 20. Additionally, the hurricane evacuation routes from all of south Okaloosa County and western Walton County have been significantly improved. The Spence Parkway is tolled separately from the Mid-Bay Bridge and utilizes ‚Äúall electronic open-road tolling‚Äù that allows customers to pay tolls without slowing down or stopping. Tolls are collected with SunPass transponders or by using a new TOLL-BY-PLATE program being implemented statewide by Florida's Turnpike Enterprise. http://www.mid-bay.com/about- us-2/spence-parkway/ Be sure to not confuse the two tolls.

It was directed by Dollan Cannell. Production The film reveals multiple methods of assassination, from exploding cigars to femmes fatales; a radio station rigged with gaseous LSD to a poison syringe posing as an innocuous fountain pen. Fabian Escalante, the former head of the Intelligence Directorate and the man who had the job of protecting Castro for many of the 49 years he was in power, alleges that there were over 600 plots and conspiracies known to Cuban agents, all dreamt up to end Castro's life. Some were perpetrated by the Central Intelligence Agency, especially during the first half of the 1960s. From the seventies onwards, the attempts were most often made by Cuban exiles who had been trained by the CIA shortly after Castro took power in 1959. The film also contains extensive material shot with Antonio Veciana, the Cuban exile who came close to killing Castro on three occasions over 17 years. He is found running a marine supplies store in Miami. All these men, the film claims, were supported and funded by the United States government. At one point the CIA even sought the help of the Mafia in the hope they would be able to succeed where so many others had failed. Other characters are Cuban exile F√©lix Rodr√≠guez, the CIA operative who trained Cuban exiles for the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and who was present when the Bolivian Army killed Che Guevara in 1967 at the request of the Bolivian President at the time, and Enrique Ovares, possibly the first man to make an attempt on Castro's life after he took power. Robert Maheu is also interviewed, the Hughes associate who served as liaison between the CIA and mobsters \\"Johnny\\" Roselli and Sam \\"Momo\\" Giancana, in another plot to kill Castro, this time using poison pills. The sub-text of the film is a comment on the contemporary \\"War on Terror\\". The film's executive producer was Peter Moore. It was directed by Dollan Cannell and the commissioning editor was Meredith Chambers. Controversy In 2006, the documentary was the center of a controversy surrounding US Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. In it the Miami Republican, who had been recently tapped to become the top Republican on the House International Relations Committee, states \\"I welcome the opportunity of having anyone assassinate Fidel Castro and any leader who is oppressing the people.\\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/12/24/rep-ileana-ros-lehtinen-r-fla- acknowledges-calling-for-fidel-castro.html A clip of her statement made its way to YouTube where the newsmedia quickly picked up the story. There was a subsequent public questioning of Ros-Lehtinen's morals and suitability for her job. She responded by asserting that the clip was spliced together and that it was taken out of context; but after her account was contested by the film's director, she eventually released a statement, on Christmas Eve, accepting that she had made the remark. She soon apologized and was later elected.

Wall was the Superintendent from 1969 until his retirement in 1990. Johnstone became the first large institution shut down by the state amid controversy over whether institutional residents could survive in a community setting. Follow-up quality of life information was collected about 225 former residents, and they were found to have fared better in group homes or supervised apartments than residents sent to other hospitals. Those who moved into community-based housing were more likely to get jobs, ride public transportation, go to restaurants and otherwise integrate into society. The study has been cited as an example of the benefits of deinstitutionalization. The validity of this study has been questioned for those residents who were placed in the community were done so due to their greater suitability to community living.

The intricately detailed imagery on the shield has inspired many different interpretations of its significance, with no definitive answer. In the poem, Achilles lends Patroclus his armor in order to lead the Achaean army into battle. Ultimately, Patroclus is killed in battle by Hector, and Achilles' armor is stripped from his body and taken by Hector as spoils. The loss of his best friend (often, called soul mate), prompts Achilles to return to battle, so his mother Thetis, a nymph, asks the god Hephaestus to provide replacement armor for her son. He obliges, and forges a shield with spectacular decorative imagery. Homer's description of the shield is the first known example of ekphrasis in ancient Greek poetry; ekphrasis is a rhetorical figure in which a detailed (textual) description is given of a (visual) work of art. Besides providing narrative exposition, it can add deeper meaning to an artwork by reflecting on the process of its creation, in turn allowing the audience to envision artwork that they can't see.James A. Francis. (2009). Metal Maidens, Achilles' Shield, and Pandora: The Beginnings of \\"Ekphrasis\\". American Journal of Philology. The passage in which Homer describes the creation of the shield has actually influenced many later poems, including the Shield of Heracles once attributed to Hesiod.The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature (1989 ed.) p.519 Virgil's description of the shield of Aeneas in Book Eight of the Aeneid is clearly modeled on Homer.Joshua Kotin. (2001). Shields of Contradiction and Direction: Ekphrasis in the Iliad and the Aeneid, 11-16. The poem The Shield of Achilles (1952) by W. H. Auden reimagines Homer's description in 20th century terms. Of other significance, this passage is recognized as the first example of cosmological mapping in the history of Greece.Germaine Aujac. (1987). The Foundations of Theoretical Cartography in Archaic and Classical Greece. The History of Cartography, volume 1 (pp. 130-147) University of Chicago Press. Description The shield of Achilles, from an 1832 illustration. Homer gives a detailed description of the imagery which decorates the new shield. Starting from the shield's centre and moving outward, circle layer by circle layer, the shield is laid out as follows: # The Earth, sky and sea, the sun, the moon and the constellations (484‚Äì89) # \\"Two beautiful cities full of people\\": in one a wedding and a law case are taking place (490‚Äì508); the other city is besieged by one feuding army and the shield shows an ambush and a battle (509‚Äì40). # A field being ploughed for the third time (541‚Äì49). # A king's estate where the harvest is being reaped (550‚Äì60). # A vineyard with grape pickers (561‚Äì72). # A \\"herd of straight-horned cattle\\"; the lead bull has been attacked by a pair of savage lions which the herdsmen and their dogs are trying to beat off (573‚Äì86). # A picture of a sheep farm (587‚Äì89). # A dancing-floor where young men and women are dancing (590‚Äì606). # The great stream of Ocean (607‚Äì609).Homer, The Iliad trans. E.V. Rieu (Penguin Classics, 1950) pp.349‚Äì53 Interpretations Thetis Receiving the Weapons of Achilles from Hephaestus by Anthony van Dyck, 1630‚Äì32. The shield of Achilles can be read in a variety of different ways. One interpretation is that the shield represents a microcosm of civilization, in which all aspects of life are shown. The depiction of law suggests the existence of social order within one city, while feuding armies depict a darker side of humanity. The imagery of nature and the universe also reinforce the belief that the shield is a microcosm of Greek life, as it can be seen as a reflection of their perception of the world. In a poetic and descriptive way, some scholars read it as a summation of the whole of human knowledge in the Homeric era. Also, the sun and the moon are shown shining simultaneously, which some consider representative of a general understanding of the universe and awareness to the cosmological order of life Germaine Aujac. (1987). The Foundations of Theoretical Cartography in Archaic and Classical Greece. The History of Cartography, volume 1 (pp. 130-147) University of Chicago Press. and as such, its akin to a mandala of antiquity. The shield shows images of conflict and discord by depicting the shield's layers as a series of contrasts ‚Äì i.e. war and peace, work and festival. Wolfgang Schadewaldt, a German writer, argues that these intersecting antitheses show the basic forms of a civilized, essentially orderly life.Wolfgang Schadewaldt, ‚ÄúDer Schild des Achilleus,‚Äù Von Homers Welt und Werk (Stuttgart 1959). This contrast is also seen as a way of making ‚Äúus‚Ä¶see [war] in relation to peace.\\".Oliver Taplin, ‚ÄúThe Shield of Achilles within the Iliad,‚Äù G&R; 27 (1980) 15.

A US citizen, he was born in Iran and raised in California. Mohebbi received his Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering with an emphasis on communications systems from the University of California, Irvine, in two years when he was only 18 years old. He followed this up with a Telecommunications Engineering Certificate from the University of California, Los Angeles. He also has an MBA (dean's scholar) from the University of California From 1983, Mohebbi undertook a series of posts in sales and marketing with Pacific Bell, including vice president-business markets; and later with SBC Communications. He then became president and Managing Director of British Telecom's United Kingdom Markets division, an $18 billion business unit serving 20 million consumers and 1.5 million businesses in the UK. At 34, he was the youngest BT Managing Director to lead a major division. After 20 months Mohebbi left to join Qwest Communications International, managing Qwests line operations, including market-facing business units; network engineering and operations; information technology and staff support functions. At age 36, Mohebbi became the youngest ever president of a major telecommunication company in the United States. He was appointed as co- chairman of merger integration for Qwest's merger with telephone company US West. Later he also joined the board of BearingPoint, when it signed a deal with Qwest to sell professional services. Allegations of fraud at Qwest In June 2002, Joseph Nacchio resigned as Chairman and CEO from Qwest, amidst allegations of insider trading and accounting fraud. Mohebbi was thought not to be involved, but correspondence before congressional hearings in October 2002 suggested Mohebbi had created side agreements with Qwest customers that, if known by the company's accountants Arthur Andersen, would have wiped out hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. These allegations were later proven to be baseless. Seven weeks after testifying, Mohebbi had resigned. In January 2004, Mohebbi was among a dozen former Qwest executives who had received \\"Wells notices,\\" written statements from the SEC that say it intended to sue. On March 15, 2005, Nacchio, Mohebbi and six other former Qwest executives were sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. They were accused of a $3 billion financial fraud between 1999 and 2002 and of benefiting from an inflated stock price. Mohebbi testified in the former Chairman's trial on insider trading. Nacchio was convicted of 19 counts of insider trading in Qwest stock on April 19, 2007. On July 27, 2007, Nacchio was sentenced to six years in federal prison. Federal Ruling in Mohebbi's Favor On March 31, 2011, United States Federal Judge Marcia Krieger issued a summary judgement denying all SEC's claims and ruling in Mohebbi's favor, citing that the regulatory agency had failed to produce necessary evidence to support its lawsuit.

Translated from the French by Samuel Putnam, and published in Manhattan by Black Manikin Press, her memoirs are a lively account of the bohemian lifestyle typical among the artists in Paris during the 1920s, with an introduction provided by Ernest Hemingway. She tells of her encounters with Man Ray, Tsuguharu Foujita, Mo√Øse Kisling, Jean Cocteau, Kees van Dongen, Cha√Øm Soutine, and others. The memoirs were first published in English in 1930, but due to their sometimes explicit content, were banned in the United States until the 1970s.

These editions were mainly put out by Samuel Roth.

Navy Island's most famous owner was the film actor Errol Flynn, who reportedly hosted many parties there. Until fairly recently, the Island has been maintained as a resort community. However, it is now a closed island owned by the Government of Jamaica. History The British Government originally gave the island to Governor Lynch of Jamaica for services to the Crown; it became known as \\"Lynch's Island\\". The Royal Navy later took over what was now called Navy island, using the facility for a gun battery at the eastern. At some point, Captain William Bligh of the Royal Navy did use the island shallows facing the mainland as a 'careening station\\" (when they turn the hulls of ships to make them available for scraping off barnacles and other maintenance). In modern times, Flynn purchased Navy Island for his private retreat. He planted a long row of royal palms that are still there today. Flynn never built a house on Navy Island, but moored his yacht, \\"Zaca\\" near a thatch-covered structure built around an existing tree. Flynn's caretaker, known as the \\"Governor\\", lived in what was then the only house on the island. Len Koutnik, a land developer from Los Angeles, purchased Navy Island and planned an upscale vacation retreat with homes under the aegis, \\"Jamaica Islandia\\". Pressed by the Government of Jamaica to begin construction, Koutnik was forced to lower his expectations for ultra posh accommodations. Harry Eiler and his wife, a California couple, built the first house there. A few other investors added similar home sites. Joseph and Gertrude Casey from Rhode Island joined with Koutnik to build a hotel and surrounding rental villas. However, Koutnik ran out of funds and the Caseys took control of the project. However, the planned construction was never completed. After Joseph Casey's death, Gertrude Casey offered the Eilers a lease on the entire island so that they could complete construction and operate the only private island resort in Jamaica - The Admiralty Club. After five years operating the Admiralty Club, the Eilers faced an employee rebellion. They had fired an employee for stealing funds. The man then fomented a rebellion against the Eilers by the resort staff. The staff took over the island and commandeered the two boats used to ferry guests to the island. They held the Eilers captive until the couple paid termination pay. After this experience, the Eilers immediately left Navy Island and left it to Gertrude Casey's supervision. In time, other investors became interested in Navy Island. However, a legal stipulation required that anyone visiting the island be allowed to use the island amenities as a guest. In addition, there was a provision for a public beach amid the circle of rental villas. These requirements made Navy Island undesirable as an upscale resort and drove away investors. In time, the Jamaican Government bought out all the remaining land titles and closed Navy Island. It remains undeveloped to this day.

The city is also known locally as Dry Harbour, and gives its name to the Dry Harbour Mountains in St. Ann. There is a dispute as to whether Christopher Columbus first landed in Discovery Bay or Sevilla la Nueva (east of Discovery Bay) in 1494. Near to the city are Puerto Seco Beach and several historic sites, such as the Green Grotto Caves and Columbus Park. Visitors to the Green Grotto Caves can see relics of the native Ta√≠no Arawak lifestyle there. It is said that many Spaniards escaped the English invasion of 1655 through secret passages in the caves with the help of Arawaks and African slaves, in exchange for their freedom.  Overview  The city of Discovery Bay sits on a bay of the same name. The bay was originally named Puerto Seco (Dry Harbour) by Christopher Columbus because, unlike the neighboring Rio Bueno bay, there are no permanent rivers flowing into it. However, groundwater does enter the bay through deep cracks in the basement limestone, especially on the geologic fault line that runs through the ship channel and on the western side. The salinities of the submerged springs are greater than 20 parts per thousand, yet they cause a marked difference in temperature and salinity in the shallow western back reef. Discovery Bay's economy is dependent upon tourism and bauxite mining. To the west of the bay is a port from which the St. Ann Bauxite Company, which employs 450 people, exports ore. The St. Ann Bauxite company was formerly named Kaiser Jamaica Bauxite Co. (KJBC), and was jointly owned by Kaiser Aluminum and the government of Jamaica. It is also the site of the Discovery Bay Marine Laboratory, operated by the University of the West Indies. Founded in 1965, the lab has hosted researchers from around the world focusing on coral reef biology and tropical coastal processes. The majority of the city's 2,700 residents are of African descent. The original Ta√≠no Arawak residents did not survive the Spanish conquest in the 16th century.

She devoted books to the Wagner family and its cultural and political influence.  Career  Wagner was born in √úberlingen on Lake Constance in Germany, the daughter of Wieland Wagner and the choreographer Gertrud Reissige. Her paternal great-grandfather was Richard Wagner, and she is also the great-great‚Äëgranddaughter of Franz Liszt. She grew up in Wahnfried, Bayreuth, until her father's death in 1966, whereupon her uncle Wolfgang Wagner had the house measured and asked her widowed mother to pay rent.Kurbjuweit, Dirk.

(Germany), She studied musicology, literature and theatre in Berlin, and holds a Ph.D. from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, obtained in 1980 under the direction of Erich Heller. She is the author of several important books on a variety of subjects, which include Karl Kraus (Geist und Geschlecht: Karl Kraus und die Erotik der Wiener Moderne, Frankfurt am Main, Suhrkamp, 1982 ‚Äî a work based on her doctoral dissertation) and the Wagner family (The Wagners: The Dramas of a Musical Dynasty, Princeton, New Jersey, Princeton University Press, 2001). Her article questioning the propriety of public subsidies given to high-profile cultural events in general, and the Bayreuth Festival in particular (at present c. US$6.5 million annually), Im Fadenkreuz der Kulturpolitik, published in the July 2006 issue of Cicero: Magazin f√ºr politische Kultur, engendered controversy within Germany. In 1999 Wagner became a member of the Deutsche Akademie f√ºr Sprache und Dichtung, and has served as its vice president since 2011. In 2001, she made a bid for directorship of the Bayreuth Festival, together with G√©rard Mortier, who had changed the Salzburg Festival, but did not expect to win. In 2004, Wagner became the director of the ', which she named P√®lerinages in honour of Liszt. She stood down from the post in September 2013. In 2013, she was named the director of the Beethovenfest, and assumed this post in January 2014. She has recognized Wagner's relation to Beethoven, who modeled his first composition on Beethoven's works. She focused less on Beethoven's symphonies, but presented more chamber music, often in contrast with contemporary works in the genre.

The root seb- () is connected to danger and flight, and thus the sense of reverence originally described fear of the gods.Burkert, Walter. Greek Religion. trans. by John Raffan.

Classical Greek usage The word was used in Classical Greece where it meant behaving as tradition dictates in one's social relationships and towards the gods. One demonstrates eusebeia to the gods by performing the customary acts of respect (festivals, prayers, sacrifices, public devotions). By extension one honors the gods by showing proper respect to elders, masters, rulers and everything under the protection of the gods.Ancient History Encyclopedia, 2012 For Platonists, \\"Eusebeia\\" meant \\"right conduct in regard to the gods\\". For the Stoics, \\"knowledge of how God should be worshiped\\". In ancient Greek religion and myth the concept of Eusebeia is anthropomorphized as the daimon of piety, loyalty, duty and filial respect. According to one source, her husband is Nomos (Law), and their daughter is Dike, goddess of justice and fair judgment. In other tellings, Dike is the daughter of the god Zeus and/or the goddess Themis (Order).\\"Eusebia: Greek goddess or spirit of piety, duty & filial respect.\\" Theoi Greek Mythology. ed. by Aaron J. Atsma. Accessed on 2007-12-11. The Roman equivalent is Pietas. The opposite of Eusebeia is Asebeia, which was considered a crime in Athens. The punishment could have been death or being exiled. Some philosophers, such as Anaxagoras, Protagoras and Socrates were accused and trialed by the Heliaia. In ancient India The Indian emperor Ashoka in his 250 BCE Edicts used the word \\"eusebeia\\" as a Greek translation for the central Buddhist and Hindu concept of \\"dharma\\" in the Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription.Hacker, Paul. Dharma in Hinduism, Journal of Indian Philosophy, 2006, 34:479-496 New Testament usage \\"Eusebeia\\" enters the New Testament in later writings, where it is typically translated as \\"godliness,\\" a vague translation that reflects uncertainty about its relevant meaning in the New Testament. For example, \\"Divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness (eus√©beia), through the true (full, personal, experiential) knowledge of Him Who called us by His own glory and excellence\\" (2 Pet 1:3) Peter.

By Ik, it is meant the additive subgroup generated by the set of all products of k elements in I. Therefore, I is nilpotent if and only if there is a natural number k such that the product of any k elements of I is 0. The notion of a nilpotent ideal is much stronger than that of a nil ideal in many classes of rings. There are, however, instances when the two notions coincide‚Äîthis is exemplified by Levitzky's theorem.Isaacs, Theorem 14.38, p. 210 The notion of a nilpotent ideal, although interesting in the case of commutative rings, is most interesting in the case of noncommutative rings. Relation to nil ideals The notion of a nil ideal has a deep connection with that of a nilpotent ideal, and in some classes of rings, the two notions coincide. If an ideal is nilpotent, it is of course nil, but a nil ideal need not be nilpotent for more than one reason. The first is that there need not be a global upper bound on the exponent required to annihilate various elements of the nil ideal, and secondly, each element being nilpotent does not force products of distinct elements to vanish. In a right Artinian ring, any nil ideal is nilpotent.Isaacs, Corollary 14.3, p. 195 This is proven by observing that any nil ideal is contained in the Jacobson radical of the ring, and since the Jacobson radical is a nilpotent ideal (due to the Artinian hypothesis), the result follows. In fact, this can be generalized to right Noetherian rings; this result is known as Levitzky's theorem.

The film stars Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davidtz, Robert Downey Jr., Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen, and Robert Duvall. Plot Rick Magruder (Kenneth Branagh) is a divorced lawyer with a reputation for underhanded dealings and protecting criminals. After another successful trial, Magruder celebrates at a party hosted by his firm, becoming increasingly drunk. As he stumbles out of the party, he has a chance meeting with a woman named Mallory Doss (Embeth Davidtz), a waitress at the party who seems to have lost her car. Rick drives the woman to her home, where her car has been already parked, seemingly by her father, Dixon Doss (Robert Duvall). Rick and Mallory walk into the house arguing about her abusive father. Mallory carelessly undresses in front of him, after which they spend the night together. The next day, Mallory asks him to file suit against her father because of his dangerous behavior. Having started a relationship with Mallory, Rick agrees and is successful in having Dixon put on trial thanks to favors from his staff, including his investigator, Clyde Pell (Robert Downey Jr.). Mallory's ex-husband, Pete Randle (Tom Berenger) also takes the stand, to testify about his former father-in-law's erratic behavior. Dixon appeals to the judge, claiming that the charges against him are fabricated and exaggerated, but the judge sentences him to a mental institution. Upon being taken away, Dixon attempts to attack Magruder, vowing revenge. With her father institutionalized, Magruder and Mallory continue their relationship, but not long after, Dixon is able to escape from the institution. Scared of retaliation, Magruder assigns Pell to guard Mallory while he attempts to gain support from the police to apprehend Dixon. The police are unhelpful, even after Dixon and his friends set Mallory's car on fire, due to the many cases Magruder has won against them. A short time later, Magruder receives an unmarked letter containing pictures of his children with their faces cut out of them. Worried for his children, he decides to take them out of school, despite not having full custody of his children and needing his wife's permission to take them. Over the objections of the teachers, Magruder escapes with his children, after assaulting a school employee. Magruder calls Pell, impelling him to find Dixon Doss. Pell informs Magruder there is now a warrant out for his arrest. Magruder takes the children to a motel. He goes outside the room to call his wife (Famke Janssen) to assure her that he has done what he has for their safety, but during the call, Magruder's children are apparently taken by Dixon's crew, and he is forced to rendezvous with Mallory so that she can lead him to her father's house. After they arrive, Magruder forces Dixon into a standoff where the older man is killed with a shot through the throat. Mallory then yells that Dixon's men are escaping with Magruder's children, and he is forced to give chase. However, upon catching them, his children are not with them, having been turned in to the police office hours earlier. Magruder is arrested by the police and Mallory is picked up back at her father's house, which is now in flames. In the aftermath, Magruder is charged with murder and is threatened with disbarment. Realizing that he has been set up, Magruder has Clyde look into Mallory's background, suspicious that she might have something to gain from her father's death. The search reveals that Dixon's land isn't worth much, but the timber (black walnut) on it is worth millions, and on top of that, Mallory had never actually divorced Pete Randle. With no will found, Mallory, and by relation, Randle, are granted ownership of Dixon's estate. Suspicious of Randle, Clyde and Magruder track the man down. Clyde is killed by Randle, and Magruder is forced into a desperate struggle in the middle of a violent hurricane. While the two grapple with one another, Mallory arrives and shoots Randle in the back with a flare gun. Her husband falls into the flood waters below, dead. Mallory claims that she had no idea about her husband's plans, but Magruder is still suspicious. He removes another flare from her flare gun, and when he returns it to her, she attempts to kill Magruder with it. Realizing that Mallory and Randle were working together, Magruder signals the police, who arrest Mallory. As the film concludes, Magruder decides not to fight the charges against him, accepting a plea deal that involves community service. In the courtroom, he spies Mallory being led away in handcuffs, who gives him a knowing look.

Kenneth Branagh liked the story and agreed to do the film but only if a highly regarded director signed on as well. Robert Altman wanted to work with the British actor but only, as he told him, \\"If we can fool the audience by not making you the hero, by making you flawed.\\" Once Altman came on board, he heavily re-worked the script, giving credit to the pseudonymous Al Hayes. Altman said in an interview, \\"I just wanted to change the elements of these kinds of stories as much as I could and then I wanted to stay out of the courtroom.\\" Altman changed the setting to Savannah, Georgia, and added the threat of a hurricane throughout the movie. For the look of the film, Altman was inspired by The Night of the Hunter. Principal photography would occur during early 1997. In addition to Two Girls and a Guy, which was also shot in the early months of 1997, the film was Robert Downey Jr.'s first acting role after a 1996 drug arrest. It has been said that Downey Jr. \\"didn't even read the script\\" when he accepted the role. Release The Gingerbread Man was intended to come out in the fall of 1997 but was delayed after an audience test screening reportedly went poorly. Polygram Films brought in an outsider in to re-edit the movie without informing Altman, and claimed that his version \\"lacked tension and suffered from an inappropriate music score\\". At one point, the publicized squabble between the studio and the filmmaker got so bad that he wanted his name taken off the film. According to Branagh, the film previewed well but not up to the expectations of the studio. He said in an interview: \\"There's this enormous pressure to wrap everything up neatly and to resist things that stray from formula. Anything that suggests complexity in a character makes them unsympathetic in the eyes of some people, and they see that as a great crime.\\" Polygram backed down when their version tested worse than Altman's in a preview. The studio was upset that Altman had completely rewritten Grisham's script so that it was more critical about lawyers. Years later, Ray Pride interviewed Altman about the post-production debacle and he replied, \\"Well, it's criminal, their treatment of that film. There was a vindictive order from the guy who was running [Polygram Films], he was so pissed off with me, he literally told them, 'I want that movie killed.' We're talking to lawyers, but it's almost impossible to win a lawsuit. You can't prove what a film could have done. They were just pissed off because it didn't test the way they wanted it to with the teenagers, y'know, in those malls.\\" Reception In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle wrote, \\"If it weren't for Altman's touches, The Gingerbread Man would be a mediocre thriller. Even with them, it can't be more than a top-notch genre film, but top-notch is top-notch.\\" Jay Carr of The Boston Globe said that the film \\"is fun junk...We're talking claptrap here, but it's more enjoyable than it has any business being, thanks to director Robert Altman and star Kenneth Branagh.\\" In his review for The Independent, Boyd Tonkin wrote, \\"It does not sprawl or wander as the Altman of old would have. Neither does it ever really catch alight. This is a waterlogged venture in more ways than one.\\" Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel gave the film two thumbs up, citing \\"brilliant filmmaking\\". The film currently holds a 59% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 44 reviews.

Mohtaram Eskandari (; 1895 - July 27, 1924), was an Iranian intellectual and a pioneer of the Iranian women's movement. She was the co-founder and first leader of Jam'iyat-e Nesvan-e Vatankhah, the first women's rights association in Persia.Sanasarian, Eliz. The Women's Rights Movements in Iran, Praeger, New York: 1982, .Afary, Janet. The Iranian Constitutional Revolution, 1906 - 1911, Columbia University Press, 1996. As the first chairperson and publisher of the Nesvan Watan Khaw newspaper, Eskandari provided lectures in support of women's rights, including women's education and the removal of veils. She planned marches for members of the association as well. Sanasarian, pages 63-64  Early life  Mohtaram was born into a liberal, intellectually vibrant and politically active family in Tehran. Her father, Mohammad Ali Mirza Eskandari (Prince of Ali Khan), was a constitutionalist and founder of the Adamiat Society and taught at Dar ul- Funun. She first studied at home with her father, and received an education in Persian and French literature under the supervision of Mirza Mohammad Ali Khan Mohaqqeqi. Eskandari and Mohaqqeqi would later marry. They both got married after a while.Pouran Farrokhzad, pages 90 and 91Iranian Women in the Constitutional Movement, pages 115-118 As an adult, Eskandari suffered from spinal cord injury, was teaching for some time, and served as the director of a state school for girls. Her dissatisfaction with the state of women's rights in Persia after the Constitutional Revolution, led her to establish Jam'iyat-e Nesvan-e Vatankhah, \\"Patriotic Women's League of Iran,\\" in 1922, which uniquely molded together feminism and Iranian nationalism. She was disappointedEncyclop√¶dia Iranica‚ÜíESKANDARƒ™,MO·∏§TARAM with the achievements of the Constitutional Revolution for women, so in 1922,Sanasarian, pages 63-64 along with a number of leading women in Tehran, she established the Patriotic Women‚Äôs Association. She lectured, administered the Association's magazine, and planned the community‚Äôs marches. In one of the rallies, they burned leaflets against women, which resulted in Mohtaram‚Äôs arrest by the government officials. But this made her name to be well-known among the people of Iran. She also founded a school for adult women and advertised for the use of national goods.Pouran Farrokhzad, pages 90 and 91 Mohtaram Eskandari died at the age of 29 in Tehran on July 1924-1925., due to complications from a back surgery she had undergone as a child. Nesvan Watan Khaw Newspaper In the year 1922, the Patriotic Women‚Äôs Association was established with the esteemed work of Mohtaram Eskandari, Nurolhouda Mangeneh, Mastureh Afshar and Madam Fakhr Afagh. The right of education for women was one of the most important goals of this association. With ten elected women, the board of directors was formed by the Patriotic Women's Association, and the same delegation elected Eskandari as the first head of the community. The association \\"Patriotic Women\\", on the path to the goals of women's education and learning, published the magazine \\"Women's Wisdom\\", in the wake of the launch of classes for older women. The newspaper was the official organ of the community that focused on women's issues and women's rights. The owner of the magazine was Madam Molouk Eskandari and her first respected director was Mohtaram Eskandari. The Nasvan Watan Khaw Newspaper published eleven issues over three years (from 1923 to 1926) and attracted many liberal women. Rebel on women‚Äôs wickedness \\"Wicked Women\\" (), is the name given to a book by a number of opponents of women's education and freedom in Tehran. This leaflet was sold by the boys in the main squares of the city. Noor-ol-Hoda Mangeneh has written in her memories‚Äô pamphlet how insulting the leaflet was and mentioned the below: Then one day, Mohtaram Eskandari, along with seven liberal women, went to the Toopkhaneh Square to remove the \\"Wicked Women\\" leaflets from the hands of the children there. They set the leaflets on fire in the middle of the square, in the same exact place of were the constitutionalists were once hanged. When those kids asked for the money of the leaflets to be given to them, Mohtaram and the other liberal women mentioned to them that they will not receive any money. Arrested for rebellion After burning the books in the square and the children crying loudly for their burned books, police arrested the women there and took them to the commission (Police station and the first interrogation area of the accused). The women were taken in different rooms and interrogated separately. In the book \\"Iranian Woman from Constitutionalism to the White Revolution\\", Badr al-Molouk wrote: Mohtaram Eskandari's name was recorded as the first woman who was arrested in contemporary history for rebellion in Iran.  Illness and death  Mohtaram was hospitalized for some time after the arrest and advent of burning the leaflets due to the severity of the illness she had and doctors said surgery should be performed on the vertebral column's. She was suffering from the disease ever since childhood and also she was made fun of since her back was always bended, but at the last minutes of her life, she continued her efforts for women's equality and advised the women in the Patriotic Women‚Äôs Association not to leave a moment of their work for women and continue for gaining women rights. Finally, Mohtaram Eskandari died in July 1924, when she was 29 years old. Her death brought sorrow and sadness among those who distinguished and worked with her. Sediqeh Dowlatabadi wrote in the deed of Mohtaram: > The late incident of losing Mohtaram Eskandari, has depressed me so much > that I cannot explain it, because I know the great efforts of this brave > Iranian girl and I conceive her loss as a great misfortune.

The person who created the first silent film was Ohn Maung (Burma's first producer and director). Start of the Burmese cinema Burma's first film was a recording of the funeral of Tun Shein - a leading politician of the 1910s, who campaigned for Burmese independence in London. It was captured with a second- hand camera by Ohn Maung and was screened at the Royal Cinema, near Scott Market (now Bogyoke Market), which belonged to a Mr Achar, a friend of Ohn Maung. Despite its documentary nature, the Burmese public was very proud of the film, which opened with the notice \\"Please accept our apologies for the poor quality of the film\\". Ohn Maung then founded The Burma Film Company to produce and direct more films. He hired Nyi Pu (Burma's first actor) to shoot the first Burmese silent film Myitta Ne Thuya (Love and Liquor) which proved a major success, despite its poor quality due to a fixed camera position and inadequate film accessories. The film opened with the title \\"Burma Film Presents: Love and Liquor\\" but there were no credits or mention of the cast. It was based on a story by P Moe Nin about how gambling and alcohol destroyed a man's life. The day the film premiered, 13 October 1920, is commemorated annually as the Myanmar Movie Day. Fox of America asked for Burmese nature study scenes and bought them from Ohn Maung. He also acquired more advanced film accessories and camera from the Kodak Company. During the 1920s and 1930s, many Burmese-owned film companies (such as A1, New Burma, British Burma, The Imperial, Bandula and Yan Gyi Aung) made and produced several films. Some of the famous directors of this era were Nyi Pu, Sunny, Tote Kyi, and Tin Pe.Aung Zaw, \\"Celluloid Disillusions,\\" Irrawaddy, vol. 12, no. 3, March 2004 , is the source of these facts regarding the early history; the article does not provide citations, but most of the material probably comes from a volume in the Burmese language published to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of cinema in the country. The first Burmese sound film was produced in 1932 in Bombay, India with the title Ngwe Pay Lo Ma Ya (Money Can't Buy It) and directed by Tote Kyi. Films dealing with social issues and political themes became popular in the 1930s. Parrot Film Company produced films that addressed social issues such as gambling and police corruption, although the films were censored by the British colonial government. There were also films that were banned like Do Daung Lan (Our Peacock Flag) in 1936 and Aung Thabyay (The Triumphant Jambul) in 1937. The political film Boycott was directed by the student leader Ko Nu in 1937 and starred other student leaders such as Aung San and Htun Ohn. The censors allowed this film to be shown. Many of the films from this era no longer exist due to the lack of adequate preservation.  Cold War era  After World War II, Burmese cinema continued to address political themes. Many of the films produced in the early Cold War era had a strong propaganda element to them. The film Pal√® Myetyay (Tear of Pearl), produced in the wake of the Kuomintang invasion of Burma in the 1950s, highlighted the importance of the armed forces or Tatmadaw to the country. Ludu Aung Than (The People Win Through) featured anti-Communist propaganda. The script was written by U Nu who served as Prime Minister during the 1950s.Charney, Michael W. (2009) \\"Ludu Aung Than: Nu's Burma During the Cold War,\\" in Christopher E. Goscha & Christian F. Ostermann (ed.), Connecting Histories: Decolonization and the Cold War in Southeast Asia, 1945-1962 (Washington, DC & Stanford California: Woodrow Wilson Center Press & Stanford University Press). The famous film maker and author Thukha started producing films during this period. His most famous film is Bawa Thanthaya (The Life Cycle). Burma held its first Academy Awards in 1952. Starting with the Socialist era in 1962, there was strict censorship and control of film scripts.  Recent history  In the era that followed the political events of 1988, the film industry has been increasingly controlled by the government. After the 1989 move by the government to open up the economy, the movie industry was privatised. The film company Mingala became the most powerful company in the industry. Film stars who had been involved in the political activities of the 1980s and 1990s, such as Aung Lwin and Tun Wai, were banned from appearing in films. The films of some directors such as Win Pe have also been banned. The government issues strict rules on censorship and largely determines who produces films, as well as who gets academy awards.Aung Zaw, \\"Celluloid Disillusions,\\" Irrawaddy, vol. 12, no. 3, March 2004 Over the years, the movie industry has also shifted to producing many lower budget direct-to-video films. Most of the movies produced nowadays are comedies.Kyi Soe Tun quoted in the Bangkok Post, 11 August 2006 In 2008, only 12 films worthy of being considered for an Academy Award were made, although at least 800 VCDs were produced.http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=14937 Another issue plaguing the Burmese cinema is a steep decline in the number of theatres in which to screen the films. According to a December 2011 survey, the number of theatres nationwide had declined to just 71 from their peak of 244. The survey also found that most were several-decade-old ageing theatres, and that only six \\"mini-theaters\\" had been built in 2009‚Äì2011. Moreover, the vast majority of the theatres were located in Yangon and Mandalay alone. Recently Myanmar cinema got visibility in international film festivals. In 2014, The Maw Naing‚Äôs The Monk was premiered at the 49th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. Followed by the participation in main competitions as; Wera Aung‚Äôs short film The Robe at 21st Busan International Film Festival and Aung Phyoe‚Äôs Cobalt Blue at 72nd Locarno Film Festival. In 2019, some local media reported a revival in the local movie industry, stating that in 2016 there were 12 movies cleared by local censorship and waiting to be screened, 18 in 2017, more than 40 in 2018, and more than 60 in 2019. The success of Now and Ever (2019), starring Zenn Kyi, was also cited as evidence of the revival. According to The Myanmar Times, the most successful Myanmar movie in 2019 was The Only Mom, directed in Myanmar by Thai director Chartchai Ketnust, starring Burmese actress Wutt Hmone Shwe Yi and telling the story of a family that moved into a colonial-era haunted house. The movie also starred a real Burmese Spiritualist medium, U Hla Aye, who died after his part of the shooting was done.

Biography Shaporin was born in Hlukhiv in the Russian Empire (now in Ukraine). His father was a painter and his mother a pianist. He received his secondary education in Saint Petersburg. He first studied philology at Kiev University and went on to study law at Saint Petersburg University. He then turned to music, starting his studies at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1913. His teachers there included Nikolay Sokolov (composition), Maximilian Steinberg (orchestration), and Nikolai Tcherepnin (conducting). He graduated as a composer and conductor in 1918. After the Bolshoi Drama Theater was established in 1919, he served as its musical director until 1928. He then worked with the Russian State Pushkin Academy Drama Theater ‚Äî also known as the Alexandrinsky Theater ‚Äî until 1934. During this period he composed a significant amount of theater music. He was a founding member of the Association for Contemporary Music in 1923. During the 1930s Shaporin turned his attention to large scale works. His opera Dekabristi (The Decembrists), to a libretto written by Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy about the Decembrist revolt, had been on Shaporin's mind since 1920 ‚Äî a 1925 interim version, Polina Gyobe, had two scenes staged in Leningrad (as it had been renamed in 1924). In 1938, Shaporin received an offer of a teaching position at the Moscow Conservatory and he moved to Moscow. That year, he completed a version of Dekabristi for a commission by the Bolshoi Theatre, but dissatisfied with it, he decided to revise it. In 1952, Shaporin was awarded the Stalin Prize. The opera was only completed in 1953, after collaboration with librettist Vsevolod Rozhdestvensky, and it was premiered at the Bolshoi Theatre on June 23, 1953. Among Shaporin's students at the Moscow Conservatory were Edward Artemiev and Rodion Konstantinovich Shchedrin. Further reading *Grosheva, Elena Andreevna, ed.

Jerzy Jan Antoni Ziƒôtek (10 June 1901 in Gleiwitz ‚Äì 20 November 1985 in Katowice, Upper Silesia) was a Polish politician and general. A Silesian Insurrectionist in his youth, during the Second World War he joined the Polish armed forces in the USSR and later became an important politician representing Silesia in the People's Republic of Poland.  Biography  Jerzy Ziƒôtek was born in the city of Gleiwitz, Prussia (Upper Silesia), in the German Empire. He was active in various Polish cultural movements, for which he was discharged from gymnasium in 1919 and passed his matura exams in front of the provisional Polish commission in Bytom. Ziƒôtek was the advocate of Silesian independence and in the aftermath of the First World War he participated actively in the Silesian Uprisings (1919-1921) against the Germans. In 1920 he was introduced to Polish Military Organization. In the third Silesian Uprising (1921), he battled in the 8th Company of the 3rd Gliwice battalion. At first, he was commander of a platoon, and later of the entire company. On more occasions he was involved in direct fighting, in ≈Åabƒôdy, Stare Ko≈∫le, Januszkowice and S≈Çawiƒôcice. He was also involved in organizing the plebiscite in Silesia, under the guidance of the League of Nations, which eventually determined to award most of Silesia to the Second Polish Republic. Nonetheless Ziƒôtek in his memoirs was disappointed with the results of the peace agreement that was pushed through by the British: \\"Everywhere, our struggle for freedom was met with disdain, especially by British politicians. Lloyd George was the most infamous of them all, having said that you can not give a watch to a monkey because the animal will break it, implying that the watch was Silesia and the monkey Poland\\" Stanislas Ziƒôtek, \\"Powsta≈Ñczy Szlak ‚Äì rozwa≈ºania powsta≈Ñcze\\", 1946, Nak≈Ç.

In 1939, after the Germans invaded Poland he fled the Nazis and found himself in the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union, (which joined the Germans in their invasion). In the Soviet Union he decided to cooperate with the Polish nationalists. In 1943 he enrolled in the Union of Polish Nationalists and joined the Polish Army, where he had the rank of pu≈Çkownik (colonel) and was the vice-commander of the Polish 3rd Infantry Division. In 1945 he became a member of the communist controlled Polish Workers Party (PPR), which later became the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR). In his political career, which lasted from 1945 until 1985, he occupied a number of different positions. First as the vice-voivod of the Silesian-DƒÖbrowa Voivodeship, from 1950 its first representative and from 1964 the leader of the voivodeship sejmik. In 1973 he became the voivod himself until 1975.

It is located between New Georgia and Nggatokae Island. To the north and east of the island is Marovo Lagoon. The island has an area of 509 square kilometres (197 sq mi). Geography The island is located at the southern end of the New Georgia Islands archipelago. To the north-west is the island of New Georgia and to the south-east is the island of Nggatokae. The largest saltwater lagoon in the world, the Marovo Lagoon, encircles most of the island. Vangunu is a volcanic island, dominated by an inactive Pleistocene stratovolcano with a height of 1082 meters (3,550 ft), whose caldera slopes are now covered with thick jungle forest. Twenty-eight kilometers (15 nmi; 17 mi) to the south of Vangunu, lies the submarine volcano Kavachi, the only currently active volcano of the archipelago, and one of the most active submarine volcanoes in the southwest Pacific Ocean. Flora and fauna The island is home to the Vanganu giant rat, discovered in 2015, which is considered critically endangered due to the small amount of forest habitat ‚Äî about ‚Äî remaining on the island and ongoing logging. Demographics In 1999, the population of Rendova was estimated at 2,212 people. Most of the people of Vangunu speak Vangunu language, while those in the northern part of the island, around the Marovo lagoon, speak the closely related Marovo language. They live mainly by subsistence agriculture and are skilled at fishing. The lagoon is a popular destination for diving. History U.S. Army's 152nd Field Artillery Battalion supports the assault on Wickham Anchorage, on or around 1 July 1943 On March 15, 1893 Vangunu was declared part of the British Solomon Islands protectorate. The island was occupied by the Japanese army in October 1942, during the Solomon Islands campaign. From 30 June to 3 July 1943, it was the site of one of the first land battle of the New Georgia Campaign, the battle of Wickham Anchorage, during which a small Japanese force was quickly mopped up by numerically superior allied forces. Since 1978, the island has been part of the independent state of the Solomon Islands.

Viking naval power was disrupted by conflicts between the Scandinavian kingdoms, but entered a period of resurgence in the thirteenth century when Norwegian kings began to build some of the largest ships seen in Northern European waters. These included king Hakon Hakonsson's Krists√∫√∞in, built at Bergen from 1262‚Äì63, which was long, of 37 rooms.N. A. M. Rodger, The Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain 660‚Äì1649 (London: Penguin UK, 2004), , pp. 74‚Äì5.

Records indicate that Alexander had several large oared ships built at Ayr, but he avoided a sea battle. Defeat on land at the Battle of Largs and winter storms forced the Norwegian fleet to return home, leaving the Scottish crown as the major power in the region and leading to the ceding of the Western Isles to Alexander in 1266.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , p. 153. English naval power was vital to Edward I's successful campaigns in Scotland from 1296, using largely merchant ships from England, Ireland and his allies in the Islands to transport and supply his armies.N. A. M. Rodger, The Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain. Volume One 660‚Äì1649 (London: Harper, 1997) pp. 74‚Äì90. Part of the reason for Robert I's success was his ability to call on naval forces from the Islands. As a result of the expulsion of the Flemings from England in 1303, he gained the support of a major naval power in the North Sea. The development of naval power allowed Robert to successfully defeat English attempts to capture him in the Highlands and Islands and to blockade major English controlled fortresses at Perth and Stirling, the last forcing Edward II to attempt the relief that resulted at English defeat at Bannockburn in 1314. Scottish naval forces allowed invasions of the Isle of Man in 1313 and 1317 and Ireland in 1315. They were also crucial in the blockade of Berwick, which led to its fall in 1318. After the establishment of Scottish independence, Robert I turned his attention to building up a Scottish naval capacity. This was largely focused on the west coast, with the Exchequer Rolls of 1326 recording the feudal duties of his vassals in that region to aid him with their vessels and crews. Towards the end of his reign he supervised the building of at least one royal man-of-war near his palace at Cardross on the River Clyde. In the late fourteenth century naval warfare with England was conducted largely by hired Scots, Flemish and French merchantmen and privateers.J. Grant, \\"The Old Scots Navy from 1689 to 1710\\", Publications of the Navy Records Society, 44 (London: Navy Records Society, 1913-4), pp. i‚Äìxii. James I took a greater interest in naval power. After his return to Scotland in 1424, he established a shipbuilding yard at Leith, a house for marine stores, and a workshop. King's ships were built and equipped there to be used for trade as well as war, one of which accompanied him on his expedition to the Islands in 1429. The office of Lord High Admiral was probably founded in this period. In his struggles with his nobles in 1488 James III received assistance from his two warships the Flower and the King's Carvel also known as the Yellow Carvel.

By the High Middle Ages, the kings of Scotland could command forces of tens of thousands of men for short periods as part of the \\"common army\\", mainly of poorly armoured spear and bowmen. After the \\"Davidian Revolution\\" of the 12th century, which introduced elements of feudalism to Scotland, these forces were augmented by small numbers of mounted and heavily armoured knights. These armies rarely managed to stand up to the usually larger and more professional armies produced by England, but they were used to good effect by Robert I of Scotland at Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 to secure Scottish independence.M. Brown, Bannockburn: the Scottish War and the British Isles, 1307‚Äì1323 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2008), , pp. 95‚Äì9. After the Wars of Scottish Independence, the Auld Alliance between Scotland and France played a large part in the country's military activities, especially during the Hundred Years' War. In the Late Middle Ages under the Stewart kings forces were further augmented by specialist troops, particularly men-at-arms and archers, hired by bonds of manrent, similar to English indentures of the same period.M.

The Stewarts also adopted major innovations in continental warfare, such as longer pikes and the extensive use of artillery. However, in the early 16th century one of the best armed and largest Scottish armies ever assembled still met with defeat at the hands of an English army at the Battle of Flodden in 1513, which saw the destruction of a large number of ordinary troops, a large section of the nobility and the king James IV.J.

In the early seventeenth century relatively large numbers of Scots took service in foreign armies involved in the Thirty Years' War.R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), , p. 183. As armed conflict with Charles I in the Bishop's Wars became likely, hundreds of Scots mercenaries returned home from foreign service, including experienced leaders like Alexander and David Leslie and these veterans played an important role in training recruits.J.

Scottish infantry were generally armed, as was almost universal in Western Europe, with a combination of pike and shot. Scottish armies may also have had individuals with a variety of weapons including bows, Lochaber axes, and halberds.P. Edwards, S. Murdoch and A. MacKillop, Fighting for Identity: Scottish Military Experience c. 1550‚Äì1900 (Leiden: Brill, 2002), , p. 240. Most cavalry were probably equipped with pistols and swords, although there is some evidence that they included lancers.M. C. Fissel, The Bishops' Wars: Charles I's Campaigns Against Scotland, 1638‚Äì1640 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), , p. 28. Royalist armies, like those led by James Graham, Marquis of Montrose (1643‚Äì44) and in Glencairn's rising (1653‚Äì54), were mainly composed of conventionally armed infantry with pike and shot.S. Reid, The Campaigns of Montrose: A Military History of the Civil War in Scotland 1639‚Äì1646 (Mercat Press, 1990), , p. 51. Montrose's forces were short of heavy artillery suitable for siege warfare and had only a small force of cavalry.J. Barratt, Cavalier Generals: King Charles I and his Commanders in the English Civil War, 1642‚Äì46 (Pen & Sword Military, 2004), , p. 169. Soldier of the Black Watch c. 1740 At the Restoration the Privy Council established a force of several infantry regiments and a few troops of horse and there were attempts to found a national militia on the English model. The standing army was mainly employed in the suppression of Covenanter rebellions and the guerrilla war undertaken by the Cameronians in the East.E. M. Furgol, \\"Warfare, weapons and fortifications: 3 1600‚Äì1700\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 637‚Äì8. Pikemen became less important in the late seventeenth century and after the introduction of the socket bayonet disappeared altogether, while matchlock muskets were replaced by the more reliable flintlock. On the eve of the Glorious Revolution the standing army in Scotland was about 3,000 men in various regiments and another 268 veterans in the major garrison towns.J. Young, \\"Army: 1600‚Äì1750\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 24‚Äì5. After the Glorious Revolution the Scots were drawn into King William II's continental wars, beginning with the Nine Years' War in Flanders (1689‚Äì97). By the time of the Act of Union, the Kingdom of Scotland had a standing army of seven units of infantry, two of horse and one troop of Horse Guards, besides varying levels of fortress artillery in the garrison castles of Edinburgh, Dumbarton, and Stirling.D. Grove, and C. Abraham, Fortress Scotland and the Jacobites (Batsford/Historic Scotland, 1995), , p. 38.

Gunpowder weaponry led to the use of gun ports, platforms to mount guns and walls adapted to resist bombardment.T. W. West, Discovering Scottish Architecture (Botley: Osprey, 1985), , p. 27.

Part of the British Armed Forces Scottish soldier's cap worn after the 1707 UnionComical depiction of a Scottish soldier, c.1720 After the Act of Union in 1707, the Scottish Army and Navy merged with those of England. The new British Army incorporated existing Scottish regiments, such as the Scots Guards (Marquis of Argyll's Royal Regiment), The Royal Scots 1st of Foot (Royal Regiment of Foot), King's Own Scottish Borderers 25th of Foot (Leven's Regiment), The 26th (Cameronian) Regiment of Foot (The Earl of Angus's Regiment), Scots Greys (Scots Dragoons) and the Royal Scots Fusiliers 21st of Foot (Earl of Mar's Regiment of Foot). The three vessels of the small Royal Scottish Navy were transferred to the Royal Navy (Royal William, a fifth-rate 32-gun frigate, became HMS Edinburgh; Royal Mary, a sixth-rate 24 gun frigate, became HMS Glasgow; Dumbarton Castle, a sixth-rate frigate, became HMS Dumbarton Castle). The new Armed Forces were controlled by the War Office and Admiralty from London. From the mid-eighteenth century the British Army began to recruit relatively large numbers of Highlanders. The first official Highland regiment to be raised for the British army was the Black Watch in 1740, but the growth of Highland regiments was delayed by the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion.A. Mackillop, \\"Highland Regiments 1750‚Äì1830\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 25‚Äì6. During this period, Scottish soldiers and sailors were instrumental in supporting the expansion of the British Empire and became involved in many international conflicts. These included the War of the Spanish Succession (1702‚Äì13), the Quadruple Alliance (1718‚Äì20), the War of the Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì48), the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì63) and the American Wars of Independence (1775‚Äì83). Napoleonic Wars Scots had a notable influence in warfare during this period. Prominent sailors of the era included: *Admiral Sir Charles (John) Napier. *Admiral Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan of Camperdown, led the Royal Navy fleet that defeated the Dutch at the Battle of Camperdown on 11 October 1797. *Admiral Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald, was one of the most daring and successful captains of the Napoleonic Wars, leading the French to nickname him \\"le loup de mer\\" (\\"the sea wolf\\"). After being dismissed from the Royal Navy, he served in the rebel navies of Chile, Brazil and Greece during their wars of independence, before being reinstated as an admiral in the Royal Navy. His life and exploits were one of the inspirations for the twentieth-century novelists C. S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower and Patrick O'Brian's Jack Aubrey. *Lieutenant-general Sir John Moore. *Alexander Abercromby. *Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch. *George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie. *Robert Craufurd. *John Hope, 4th Earl of Hopetoun Victorian & Colonial Warfare First World War Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) in a trench at the Somme, 1916 Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig led the British Army on the Western Front from 1915, and oversaw some of the largest and bloodiest episodes of the war. Battles included the Somme(1916) Ypres (1917) Cambrai (1917) Amiens (1918) and Arras (1918) Due to the kilts worn by the Scottish soldiers on the World War I battlefront, their German enemies called them the \\"ladies from hell\\". Haig founded the Earl Haig Poppy Fund, for ex-servicemen in the aftermath. According to the historian T C Smout, \\"It is still not known how many Scots died in the war. One well-argued estimate put the figure at 110,000, equivalent to about 10 percent of the Scottish male population aged between sixteen and fifty, and probably to about 15 per cent of total British war dead ‚Äî the sacrifice was higher in proportionate terms than for any other country in the Empire.\\"T C Smout, A Century of The Scottish People, 1830‚Äì1950, Collins 1986, p.267 Second World War Scottish soldiers fought in many battles in World War II, in both the Pacific and European theatres. The Cold War & The End of Empire Defence establishments in Scotland Army In the wake of the Jacobite risings, several fortresses were built throughout the Highlands in the 18th century by General Wade in order to pacify the region, including Fort George, Fort Augustus and Fort William. The Ordnance Survey was also commissioned to map the region. Later, due to their topography and perceived remoteness, parts of Scotland have housed many sensitive defence establishments, some controversial. During World War II, Allied and British Commandos trained at Achnacarry in the Highlands and the island of Gruinard was used for an exercise in biological warfare. Regular British Army Garrisons currently operational in Scotland are: Fort George near Inverness; Redford Barracks and Dreghorn Barracks in Edinburgh; and Glencorse Barracks at Penicuik. Royal Naval Between 1960 and 1991, the Holy Loch was a base for the US Navy's fleet of Polaris-armed ballistic missile submarines. Today, HM Naval Base Clyde, west of Glasgow, is the base for the four Trident-armed ballistic missile submarines which are armed with approximately 200 Trident nuclear warheads.House of Commons Written Answers, Hansard, 14 Jul 1998 : Column: 171 Since the decommissioning of free-falling bombs in 1998, the Trident SLBM system is the UK's only nuclear deterrent. HMS Caledonia at Rosyth in Fife is the support base for navy operations in Scotland and also serves as the Naval Regional Office (NRO Scotland and Northern Ireland). The Royal Navy's LR5 and Submarine Rescue Service is based in Renfrew, near Glasgow. The Royal Navy's submarine nuclear reactor development establishment, is located at Vulcan NTRE, adjacent to Dounreay, which was the site of the UK's fast breeder nuclear reactor programme. RM Condor at Arbroath, Angus is home to 45 Commando, Royal Marines, part of 3 Commando Brigade. Also, the Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines is based at HMNB Clyde. Since 1999, the Scottish Government has had devolved responsibility over fisheries protection duties in Scotland's exclusive economic zone, carried out by the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency, which consists of a fleet of four offshore patrol vessels and two Cessna 406 maritime patrol aircraft.Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency Royal Air Force A single front-line Royal Air Force station is located in Scotland. RAF Lossiemouth, located in Moray, is the RAF's northern QRA(I) base, supported by four squadrons of Typhoons.

Prominent Training Areas include Garelochhead, Cape Wrath, Barry Buddon, The Army Selection and Development Center in Penicuik, and Castlelaw in the Pentland Hills. Industry The bulk of the Royal Navy's surface fleet, such the Type 45 destroyer , is designed and built by BAE Systems Surface Ships in Glasgow. Although diminished from its early 20th century heights, Glasgow remains the hub of the UK's shipbuilding industry. Defence contractors and related companies employ around 30,000 people in Scotland and form an important part of the economy. The principal companies operating in the country include: BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Raytheon, Thales and Babcock.

In 2006, the remaining regiments, known collectively as the Scottish Division, were amalgamated to form the Royal Regiment of Scotland. The amalgamation was vigorously opposed by veterans and supporters of the old regiments. Scottish soldiers serve nationally alongside soldiers from England, Wales and Northern Ireland in all Combat Support Arms and Services (RA, RE, Signals, Intelligence, AAC, RLC, AGC, REME and AMS),

Unlike other pure JavaScript frameworks such as the Dojo Toolkit and Prototype, Spry is geared towards web designers, not web developers. On August 29, 2012, Adobe announced that it will no longer continue development of Spry and handed it over to the community on GitHub.  Components  The Spry framework broadly consists of * Spry Effects - animation effects like blind, fade, grow, highlight, shake, slide and squish. * Spry Data - data binding to HTML markup using minimal code or proprietary markup. Spry uses Google's Xpath JavaScript library to convert XML into JavaScript objects. It can handle XML, HTML and JSON data. * Spry Widgets - framework for development of widgets, and included widgets such as the accordion.  Versions  Spry is currently in beta.

Accessed 29 July 2011. In 1885 Inspector Herbert T. Thomas of the local constabulary began an attempt to reach the highest peak of the range, and in 1890 was successful, publishing an account in his book 'Untrodden Jamaica'.He requested the then governor Sir Henry Blake to consent that they be renamed the Blake Mountains, but admits in his book the change met with opposition. The new name did not stick and they remain the John Crow Mountains. In 1920 the explorer Scoresby Routledge claimed to have been the first person to have crossed the John Crow mountains, leading to an exchange of letters in The Times regarding Inspector Thomas's prior claim. The matter was settled by the Jamaican Surveyor-General, who decided that though Thomas had been the first to scale the highest peak, and explore the ridge in a north-south direction, Mr. Routledge had traversed the valley and further range beyond: and thus he first \\"actually crossed them from west to east\\". The John Crow Mountains are also home to the endangered Papilio homerus, the largest butterfly in the Americas.

The environmental impact of aviation occurs because aircraft engines emit heat, noise, particulates and gases which contribute to climate change and global dimming. Despite more fuel-efficient and less polluting turbofan and turboprop engines, the rapid growth of air travel contributes to an increase in total pollution attributable to aviation. From 1992 to 2005, passenger kilometres increased 5.2 percent per year. Climate change  Factors  Radiative forcings from aviation emissions (gases and aerosols) in 1992 as estimated by the IPCC Like other activities involving combustion, most forms of aviation release carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) and other greenhouse gases into the Earth's atmosphere, contributing to the acceleration of global warmingAnderson, K. (17 June 2008). Reframing climate change: from long-term targets to emission pathways (esp. slide 24 onward). Airplanes emit gases such as carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ), water vapor, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides; and particles like hydrocarbons, sulfur oxides, and black carbon which interact among themselves and with the atmosphere. While the principal greenhouse gas emission from powered aircraft in flight is CO‚ÇÇ, other emissions include nitrogen oxides or NO‚Çì (nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide), water vapour and particulates (soot and sulfate particles), sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide (bonding with oxygen to become CO‚ÇÇ upon release), incompletely burned hydrocarbons, and radicals such as hydroxyl, depending on the type of aircraft in use. As jet airliners fly in the tropopause, their total impact on climate change may increase beyond CO‚ÇÇ emissions, contributing to climate change in four ways:> ; Carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) : CO‚ÇÇ emissions from aircraft-in-flight are the most significant and best understood element of aviation's total contribution to climate change.Sausen et al. (2005). \\"Aviation radiative forcing in 2000: an update on IPCC\\" (PDF). Meteorologische Zeitschrift. Gebr√ºder Borntraeger. 14 (4): 555‚Äì561. doi:10.1127/0941-2948/2005/0049. Retrieved 2017-02-03. The level and effects of CO‚ÇÇ emissions are broadly the same regardless of altitude and they have the same atmospheric effects as ground-based emissions. Ground airport vehicles and those used by passengers and staff to access airports, as well as emissions generated by the construction of airport infrastructure and aircraft manufacture also contributes to the greenhouse gas emissions from the aviation industry.Horvath A, Chester M (2008). Environmental Life-cycle Assessment of Passenger Transportation An Energy, Greenhouse Gas and Criteria Pollutant Inventory of Rail and Air Transportation. University of California Transportation Center, UC Berkeley. ; Nitrogen oxides (NO‚Çì) : In the tropopause, emissions of NO‚Çì favor ozone (O‚ÇÉ) formation in the upper troposphere. Altitudes from 8 to 13 km, NO‚Çì emissions result in greater concentrations of O‚ÇÉ than surface NO‚Çì emissions, and these in turn have a greater global warming effect. The effect of O‚ÇÉ surface concentrations are regional and local, but it becomes well mixed globally at mid and upper tropospheric levels. NO‚Çì emissions also reduce ambient levels of methane, another greenhouse gas, resulting in a climate cooling effect. But this effect does not offset the O‚ÇÉ forming effect of NO‚Çì emissions. Aircraft sulfur and water emissions in the stratosphere tend to deplete O‚ÇÉ, partially offsetting the NO‚Çì-induced O‚ÇÉ increases. These effects have not been quantified. Light aircraft or small commuter aircraft fly lower in the troposphere, not in the tropopause. Contrails and Cirrus clouds ; Water vapor (H‚ÇÇO), and contrails : One of the products of burning hydrocarbons with oxygen is water vapour, a greenhouse gas. Water vapour produced by aircraft engines at high altitude, under certain atmospheric conditions, condenses into droplets to form condensation trails, or \\"contrails\\". Contrails are visible line clouds that form in cold, humid atmospheres and are thought to have a global warming effect (though one less significant than either CO‚ÇÇ emissions or NO‚Çì induced effects).SPM-2 Contrails are uncommon from lower-altitude aircraft. Cirrus clouds have been observed to develop after the persistent formation of contrails and have been found to have a global warming effect over-and-above that of contrail formation alone. The contribution of contrail and cirrus cloud formation to global warming is uncertain, and attempts to estimate aviation's overall climate change contribution do not tend to include its effects on cirrus cloud enhancement. A 2015 study found that artificial cloudiness caused by contrail \\"outbreaks\\" reduces the difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures. The former are decreased and the latter are increased, in comparison to temperatures the day before and the day after such outbreaks.Bernhardt, J. & Carleton, A.M. (2015). The impacts of long- lived jet contrail 'outbreaks' on surface station diurnal temperature range. Journal of International Climatology. Online-early (July). On days with outbreaks the day versus night temperature difference was diminished by about in the southern US and in the US midwest.Jet contrails affect surface temperatures. Science Daily. 18 June 2015. ; Particulates : Soot and sulfate particles weight less than other emissions. Soot absorbs heat and has a warming effect; sulfate particles reflect radiation and have a cooling effect. Particles can influence the formation and properties of clouds, including artificial contrails and natural cirrus clouds. Contrails and cirrus clouds evolving from particles are thought to have a greater radiative forcing effect than cumulated aviation CO‚ÇÇ emissions. Soot particles are thought to be causing the most contrail formation since they are large enough to serve as condensation nuclei for water vapor. Reducing the aromatic content of jet fuel may decrease the amount of soot produced. In an attempt to aggregate and quantify the total climate impact of aircraft emissions, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated that aviation's total climate impact is some two to four times that of its direct CO‚ÇÇ emissions alone (excluding the potential impact of cirrus cloud enhancement). This is measured as radiative forcing. While there is uncertainty about the exact level of impact of NO‚Çì and water vapour, governments have accepted the broad scientific view that they do have an effect. UK government policy statements have stressed the need for aviation to address its total climate change impacts and not simply the impact of CO‚ÇÇ.The Future of Air Transport White Paper (2003), HMSO \\"The aviation industry is encouraged to take account of, and where appropriate reduce, its contribution to global warming...The impact of aviation on climate change is increased over that of direct CO‚ÇÇ emissions alone by some of the other emissions released and their specific effects at altitude\\". The Emissions weighting factor by which aviation CO‚ÇÇ emissions should be multiplied to get the CO‚ÇÇ-equivalent emissions for annual fleet average conditions is in the range of 1.3 to 2.9. The IPCC calculate a radiative forcing around 2.7 times that of CO2 alone (between 2 and 4), while a EU commission study ending in 2003 updated this figure at 1.9.  Volume  By 2018, Airline traffic reached 4.3 billion passengers with 37.8 million departures, an average of passengers per flight, and 8.26 trillion RPKs, an average journey of , according to the ICAO. The traffic was in a continuous growth, doubling every 15 years despite external shocks ‚àí a 4.3% average yearly growth, and Airbus was expecting the growth to continue. As the increase in traffic outpace the fuel efficiency improvements, the aviation fuel usage and emissions continue to rise. In 1992, aircraft emissions represented 2% of all man-made CO‚ÇÇ emissions, having accumulated a little more than 1% of the total man-made CO‚ÇÇ increase over 50 years. In 2018, global commercial operations emitted 918 million tonnes (Mt) of CO‚ÇÇ, 2.4% of all CO‚ÇÇ emissions: 747 Mt for passenger transport and 171 Mt for freight operations. Between 1990 and 2006, greenhouse gas emissions from aviation increased by 87% in the European Union. In 2010, about 60% of aviation emissions came from international flights, outside the emission reduction targets of the Kyoto Protocol. International flights are not covered either by the Paris Agreement to avoid a patchwork of individual country regulations; but the agreement was adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization, capping airlines carbon emissions to the year 2020 level while they are allowed to buy carbon credits from other industries and projects. In 1992, aircraft radiative forcing was estimated by the IPCC at 3.5% of the total man-made radiative forcing. A 2007 report from Environmental Change Institute of the Oxford University postulates a range closer to four percent cumulative effect, when including forcing effects. Per passenger In 2018, CO‚ÇÇ emissions totalled 747 million tonnes for passenger transport, for 8.5 trillion revenue passenger kilometres (RPK), giving an average of 88 gram CO‚ÇÇ per RPK. Emissions per passenger kilometre vary according to the size and type of aircraft, the altitude, the freight and passenger occupancy rate, the distance flown and the route stops, while the radiative forcing is greater at higher altitudes. In 2017, the average airline fuel consumption per passenger was , 24% less than in 2005, but as the traffic grew by 60% to 1,643 billion passenger kilometres, CO‚ÇÇ emissions were up by 16% to 163 million tonnes for g/km CO‚ÇÇ per passenger. In 2018, the US airlines had a fuel consumption of per revenue passenger for domestic flights, or g of fuel per km, generating g CO‚ÇÇ / RPK of emissions. In 2013, the World Bank evaluated the business class carbon footprint as 3.04 times higher than economy class in wide-body aircraft, and first class 9.28 times higher, due to premium seating taking more space, lower weight factors, and larger baggage allowances (assuming Load Factors of 80% for Economy Class, 60% for Business Class, and 40% for First Class). The International Council on Clean Transportation also evaluated the carbon footprint taken by Etihad's first class suite in its A380.  Evolution  In 1999, the IPCC estimated aviation's contribution could grow to five percent of the total contribution by 2050 if action is not taken to tackle these emissions, though the highest scenario is 15 percent. Moreover, if other industries achieve significant cuts in their own greenhouse gas emissions, aviation's share as a proportion of the remaining emissions could also rise. In a 2008 presentation and paper, Professor Kevin Anderson of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research showed how continued aviation growth in the UK threatens the ability of that nation to meet CO‚ÇÇ emission reduction goals necessary to contain the century- end temperature increase to even 4¬∞ or 6 ¬∞C. The projected domestic aviation carbon emission increase for the UK as growing from 11 MT in 2006 to 17 MT in 2012, at the UK's historic annual emission growth rate of seven percent. Beyond 2012 if the growth rate were reduced to three percent yearly, carbon emissions in 2030 would be 28 MT, which is 70 percent of the UK's entire carbon emissions budget that year for all sectors of society. This work also suggests the foreseeable future which confronts many other nations that have high dependency on aviation.Anderson K, Bows A (2008). the climate change challenge in light of post-2000 emission trends.

Climate change and aviation: Issues, challenges and solutions. http://www.earthscan.co.uk/?tabid=42745 Published in Nature Climate Change, a report by the National Center for Atmospheric Science at the University of Reading forecasts that increasing CO‚ÇÇ levels will result in a significant increase in in-flight turbulence experienced by transatlantic airline flights by the middle of the 21st century. A December 2015 report finds that aircraft could generate of carbon pollution through to 2050, consuming almost 5 percent of the remaining global climate budget. Without regulation, global aviation emissions may triple by mid-century and could emit more than of carbon annually under a high-growth, business-as-usual scenario. By 2020, global international aviation emissions are projected to be around 70% higher than in 2005. Efforts to bring aviation emissions under an effective global accord have so far largely failed, despite there being a number of technological and operational improvements on offer.  Other effects  Increased CO‚ÇÇ concentrations also develops ocean acidification : in the Southern Ocean, an ecological tipping point is projected to occur by the year 2030, no later than 2038.McNeil BI, Matear RJ (2008). Southern Ocean acidification: A tipping point at 450-ppm atmospheric CO2. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (105:48; p.18860). Pandemics See Health hazards of air travel#Infection Noise Aircraft noise is seen by advocacy groups as being very hard to get attention and action on. The fundamental issues are increased traffic at larger airports and airport expansion at smaller and regional airports. Aviation authorities and airlines have developed Continuous Descent Approach procedures https://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/publication/files/2011-cd- brochure-web.pdf to reduce noise footprint. Current applicable noise standards effective since 2014 are FAA Stage 4 and (equivalent) EASA Chapter 4. Aircraft with lower standards are restricted to a time window or, on many airports, banned completely. Stage 5 will become effective between 2017‚Äì2020. Quantification and comparison of noise effects per seat-distance takes into account that noise from cruise levels usually does not reach the earth surface (as opposed to surface-transportation) but is concentrated on and in proximity of airports. Water pollution Aircraft deicing. Excess deicing fluid may contaminate nearby water bodies, if not properly recovered. Fuel and chemical spills Airports can generate significant water pollution due to their extensive use and handling of jet fuel, lubricants and other chemicals. Airports install spill control structures and related equipment (e.g., vacuum trucks, portable berms, absorbents) to prevent chemical spills, and mitigate the impacts of spills that do occur. Deicing chemicals In cold climates, the use of deicing fluids can also cause water pollution, as most of the fluids applied to aircraft subsequently fall to the ground and can be carried via stormwater runoff to nearby streams, rivers or coastal waters. Airlines use deicing fluids based on ethylene glycol or propylene glycol as the active ingredient. Airports also use chemical deicers on runways, taxiways and other paved surfaces, which tend to run off to nearby water bodies. Pavement deicers may contain potassium acetate, glycol compounds, sodium acetate, urea or other chemicals. Ethylene glycol and propylene glycol are known to exert high levels of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) during degradation in surface waters. This process can adversely affect aquatic life by consuming oxygen needed by aquatic organisms for survival. Large quantities of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the water column are consumed when microbial populations decompose propylene glycol. Sufficient dissolved oxygen levels in surface waters are critical for the survival of fish, macroinvertebrates, and other aquatic organisms. If oxygen concentrations drop below a minimum level, organisms emigrate, if able and possible, to areas with higher oxygen levels or eventually die. This effect can drastically reduce the amount of usable aquatic habitat. Reductions in DO levels can reduce or eliminate bottom feeder populations, create conditions that favor a change in a community's species profile, or alter critical food-web interactions. Air quality  Particulate emissions  Ultrafine particles (UFPs) are emitted by aircraft engines during near-surface level operations including taxi, takeoff, climb, descent, and landing, as well as idling at gates and on taxiways. Other sources of UFPs include ground support equipment operating around the terminal areas. In 2014, an air quality study found the area impacted by ultrafine particles from the takeoffs and landings downwind of Los Angeles International Airport to be much larger than previously thought.Weikel, Dan and Barboza, Tony (29 May 2014) \\"Planes' exhaust could be harming communities up to 10 miles from LAX\\" Los Angeles Times Typical UFP emissions during takeoff are on the order of 1015‚Äì1017 particles emitted per kilogram of fuel burned. Non-volatile soot particle emissions are 1014‚Äì1016 particles per kilogram fuel on a number basis and 0.1‚Äì1 gram per kilogram fuel on a mass basis, depending on the engine and fuel characteristics.  Lead emissions  Some 167,000 piston engine aircraft‚Äîabout three-quarters of private planes in the United States‚Äîrelease lead (Pb) into the air due to leaded aviation fuel. From 1970 to 2007, general aviation aircraft emitted about 34,000 tons of lead into the atmosphere according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Lead is recognized as a serious environmental threat by the Federal Aviation Administration if inhaled or ingested leading to adverse effects on the nervous system, red blood cells and cardiovascular and immune systems with infants and young children especially sensitive to even low levels of lead, which may contribute to behavioral and learning problems, lower IQ and autism. Land use for infrastructure Airport buildings, taxiways and runways occupy part of the local ecosystem. Most of aircraft movement however is in air at altitude and so is away from direct interaction with sensitive natural surface features or human detection. This is different from roads, railways and canals, which are very significant in use of land and the dividing of ecological zones. Mitigation Emissions from aviation are continuing to grow despite advances in aircraft efficiency. Currently 2% of global emissions are created by the aviation industry. Aviation affects the environment due to aircraft engines emitting noise, particulates, and gases which contribute to climate change and global dimming. Despite more fuel-efficient (and therefore less polluting) turbofan and turboprop engines, the rapid growth of air travel in recent years contributes to an increase in total pollution attributable to aviation. In the EU, greenhouse gas emissions from aviation increased by 87% between 1990 and 2006. At present aviation accounts for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions. Due to projected growth in air travel, in the most technologically radical scenarios for having a better than 50% chance of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, in 2050 aviation will make up 15% of global CO2 emissions. In more conventional scenarios its emissions will exceed the entire global carbon budget before then.Bows A. (2010). Aviation and climate change: confronting the challenge. Aeronautical Journal. 114:1158:pp.459-468. This presents governments and the operators of aircraft with a responsibility to reduce the aviation industry's emissions.  Reducing air travel  Reduction of one's carbon footprint for various actions. Some methods aim to mitigate aviation's environmental impact by reducing aviation in general. This can be achieved through various means, such as route optimization, emission caps, short- distance restrictions, increasing taxation and decreasing subsidies. =Personal choices and social pressure= The German video short The Bill\\"The Bill\\", by Peter Wedel, distributed by GermanWatch. explores how travel and its impacts are commonly viewed in everyday developed-world life, and the social pressures that are at play. British writer George Marshall has investigated common rationalizations that act as barriers to making personal choices to travel less, or to justify recent trips. In an informal research project, \\"one you are welcome to join\\", he says, he deliberately steered conversations with people who are attuned to climate change problems to questions about recent long-distance flights and why the travel was justified. Reflecting on actions contrary to their beliefs, he noted, \\"(i)ntriguing as their dissonance may be, what is especially revealing is that every one of these people has a career that is predicated on the assumption that information is sufficient to generate change ‚Äì an assumption that a moment's introspection would show them was deeply flawed.\\"Marshall, G. (2009, 24-July). Why We Still Don‚Äôt Believe In Climate Change In Sweden the concept of \\"flight shame\\" or \\"flygskam\\" has been cited as a cause of falling air travel. Swedish rail company SJ AB reports that twice as many Swedish people chose to travel by train instead of by air in summer 2019 compared with the previous year. Swedish airports operator Swedavia reported 4% fewer passengers across its 10 airports in 2019 compared to the previous year: a 9% drop for domestic passengers and 2% for international passengers; =Business and professional choices= For example, by 2003 Access Grid technology has already been successfully used to host several international conferences, and technology has likely progressed substantially since then. The Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research has been systematically studying means to change common institutional and professional practices that have led to large carbon footprints of travel by research scientists, and issued a report.Le Qu√©r√©, C. et al. 2015. Towards a culture of low-carbon research for the 21st Century. Abstract page.Id. The Report. Nudging Climate Scientists To Follow Their Own Advice On Flying. FiveThirtyEight. by Christie Aschwanden. 26 March 2015. =Ending incentives to fly‚Äîfrequent flyer programs= Over 130 airlines have \\"frequent flyer programs\\" based at least in part on miles, kilometers, points or segments for flights taken. Globally, such programs included about 163 million people as reported in 2006.The Economist (2005, 20-Dec), Frequent- flyer miles ‚Äî Funny money. These programs benefit airlines by habituating people to air travel and, through the mechanics of partnerships with credit card companies and other businesses, in which high profit margin revenue streams can amount to selling free seats for a high price. The only part of United Airlines business that was making money when the company filed for bankruptcy in 2002 was its frequent flyer program. Concerning business travel, \\"The ease of international air travel and the fact that, for most of us, the costs are met by our employers, means that ... globe trotting conference travel is often regarded as a perk of the job.\\" However, the perk usually is not only the business trip itself, but also the frequent flyer points which the individual accrues by taking the trip, and which can be redeemed later for personal air travel. Thus a conflict of interest is established, whereby bottom-up pressure may be created within a firm or government agency for travel that is really not necessary. Even when such conflict is not a motivation, the perk of frequent flyer miles can be expected to lead in many cases to personal trips that would not be taken if a ticket had to be paid for with personal funds. By just using an airline-sponsored credit card to pay one's household expenses, personal or business bills, or even expense bills charged to an employer, frequent flyer points can be racked up quickly. Thus, free travel‚Äîfor which the individual has to pay nothing extra‚Äîbecomes a reality. Across society, this too can be expected to lead to much air travel‚Äîand greenhouse gas emissions‚Äîthat otherwise would not occur.MedCaribbean.com. Making The Most Of Your Airlines Miles Credit Cards. Several studies have contemplated the elimination of frequent flyer programmes (FFPs), on the grounds of anti-competitiveness, ethics,Cognac M, DeLozier M (1997) Frequent Flyer Programs Promotion: An Analysis Of A Paradoxical Industry.

Annals of Tourism Research There is a record of governments disallowing or banning FFPs and of industry players requesting bans. Denmark did not allow the programs until 1992, then changed its policy because its airlines were disadvantaged. In 2002, Norway banned domestic FFPs in order to promote competition among its airlines.Aftenpost (2002). Sterling polishes plans for new routes , by Nina Berglund, 19 March 2002. In the U.S. in 1989, a vice president of Braniff \\"said the government should consider ordering an end to frequent-flyer programs, which he said allow unfair competition.\\"Orlando Sentinel (1989). Braniff Will SlimDown, Keep Flying, by Kenneth Michael, 4 October 1989. A Canadian study said that because of competition no airline could unilaterally end its FFP, but that a national government could use its regulatory power to end the programs broadly, which in Canada's case would also require North America-wide cooperation. In further analysis, a Scandinavian study which recommended an end to frequent flyer plans said, \\"the only possible way of prohibiting FFPs successfully now that they have spread from the US to Europe to the Far East would be to do so on a global basis. The basis exists: it could be done by the World Trade Organization.\\" A 2011 study which surveyed frequent flyers in the U.K. and Norway, looked into behavioral addition to frequent flying and the \\"flyer's dilemma\\" of the conflict between \\"the social and personal benefits of flying and air travel's impact on climate change.\\" It concluded that: =Potential for governmental constraints on demand= There is an ongoing debate about possible taxation of air travel and the inclusion of aviation in an emissions trading scheme, with a view to ensuring that the total external costs of aviation are taken into account.Including Aviation into the EU ETS: Impact on EU allowance prices ICF Consulting for DEFRA February 2006 Comprehensive research shows that despite anticipated efficiency innovations to airframes, engines, aerodynamics and flight operations, there is no end in sight, even many decades out, to rapid growth in CO2 emissions from air travel and air freight,Bows-Larkin A., Mander S., Traut M., Anderson K., Wood P. (2016). Aviation and Climate Change ‚Äì The Continuing Challenge. Encyclopedia of aerospace engineering. See esp. Fig. 7. due to projected continual growth in air travel.Boeing (2014). Current Market Outlook, 2014‚Äì2033.Airbus (2015). Flying by Numbers: Global Market Forecast 2015‚Äì2034 . This is because international aviation emissions escaped international regulation until the ICAO triennial conference in 2016 agreed on the CORSIA offset scheme. In addition, due to low or non-existent taxes on aviation fuel, air travel enjoys a competitive advantage over other transportation modes due to lower fares.EU governments miss out on up to ‚Ç¨39bn a year due to aviation‚Äôs tax breaks - Transport and Environment Unless market constraints are put in place, growth in aviation emissions will result in the sector's emissions amounting to all or nearly all of the annual global emissions budget by mid-century, if climate change is to be held to a temperature increase of 2 ¬∞C or less.Bows A., Anderson K., Upham P. (2009). Aviation and Climate Change: Lessons for European Policy. Routledge. 146pp. (See esp. Ch.5). One means for reducing the environmental impact of aviation is to constrain demand for air travel, through increased fares in place of expanded airport capacity. Several studies have explored this: *The UK study Predict and Decide ‚Äì Aviation, climate change and UK policy, notes that a 10 percent increase in fares generates a 5‚Äì15 percent reduction in demand, and recommends that the British government should manage demand rather than provide for it. This would be accomplished via a strategy that presumes \\"‚Ä¶ against the expansion of UK airport capacity\\" and constrains demand by the use of economic instruments to price air travel less attractively. *A study published by the campaign group Aviation Environment Federation (AEF) concludes that by levying ¬£9 billion of additional taxes, the annual rate of growth in demand in the UK for air travel would be reduced to two percent. *The ninth report of the House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee, published in July 2006, recommends that the British government rethink its airport expansion policy and considers ways, particularly via increased taxation, in which future demand can be managed in line with industry performance in achieving fuel efficiencies, so that emissions are not allowed to increase in absolute terms. = Route optimization = Currently, air traffic corridors that aircraft are forced to follow place unnecessary detours on an aircraft's route forcing higher fuel burn and an increase in emissions. An improved Air Traffic Management System with more direct routes and optimized cruising altitudes would allow airlines to reduce their emissions by up to 18%. In the European Union, a Single European Sky has been proposed since 1999, so that there are no overlapping airspace restrictions between countries in the EU and so reduce emissions. As of 2007, the lack of a Single European Sky created an excess of 12 million tons of CO2 emissions per year. Although progress has been made, the Single European Sky has still not been completely achieved as of September 2020; in 2019 alone, this added an extra 6 billion euros in costs, and 11.6 million megatonnes of excess CO2 emissions. = Emission caps = In the European Union, an aviation European Emission Trading Scheme has operated since 2012. The scheme places a cap on the emissions an aircraft operator can emit and forces the operator to either lower emissions through more efficient technology or to buy \\"Carbon Credits\\" from other companies who have produced fewer emissions than their cap. It is thought that this will reduce aviation's net environmental impact. = Short- distance restrictions = In the 2010s and 2020s, several governments have imposed restrictions and even prohibitions on short-distance aviation (also known as short-haul flights), stimulating or pressuring travellers to opt for more environmentally friendly means of transportation, especially trains. * : As part of its COVID-19 crisis support programme for Austrian Airlines in June 2020, the conservative‚Äìgreen coalition government introduce a special tax of 30 euros on airline tickets for flights spanning less than 350 kilometres (an unprecedented environmental measure within the EU), while airline connections that covered distances that could be travelled within three hours by train were henceforth prohibited. * : On 3 June 2019, French MPs proposed to prohibit airline connections covering distances that could be travelled within 2.5 hours by train. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire stated in April 2020 and repeated in May 2020 that negotiations between the government and Air France‚ÄìKLM on such a 2.5 hour short-distance ban were underway. On 9 June 2020, as part of its COVID-19 crisis support programme for France's aviation sector, Le Maire confirmed that 2.5 hour short-distance flights would be prohibited, while Air France‚ÄìKLM's domestic flights would be reduced by 40%. * : In June 2013, Dutch MP Liesbeth van Tongeren (GreenLeft, previously Greenpeace Netherlands director) proposed to prohibit domestic flights in the Netherlands with the argument that they are needlessly inefficient, polluting and expensive, but Environment Secretary Wilma Mansveld (Labour Party) said such a ban would violate EU regulations that allow airlines to fly domestically. In March 2019, the House of Representatives of the Netherlands voted to prohibit commercial flights between Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and Brussels Airport (Zaventem). This distance of about 150 kilometres was covered by five return flights a day, most of them feeder flights: passengers from Brussels go to Amsterdam to embark on a long-distance flight from there, or vice versa. However, Infrastructure Minister Cora van Nieuwenhuizen (VVD) stated that such a ban was contrary to the European Commission's free market regulations and was thus not implemented. Although almost all Dutch parliamentary parties agreed that train travel should replace short-distance aviation, there were also some practical problems to be solved before trains could become a viable alternative, such buying a combined train/plane ticket, the lack of a direct Thalys connection from Amsterdam Central and Paris-North to Brussels Airport (forcing passengers to switch trains in Brussels-South), and the fact that the Benelux train (which does directly connect Schiphol and Zaventem) takes over 2 hours (mostly due to the lack of a high-speed rail between Antwerp and Brussels). In a September‚ÄìOctober 2019 poll conducted by the European Investment Bank (EIB) amongst 28,088 EU citizens from the then 28 member states, 62% said they were in favour of banning short-haul flights. = Combined train/plane tickets = One way to reduce feeder flights is to make it easier for passengers to buy a combined train/plane ticket. As of March 2019, Lufthansa and Air France already offer this possibility: * A passenger who books a trip from Cologne to Madrid via Lufthansa is routed to Frankfurt with a Deutsche Bahn train ticket, from where they will fly to Madrid with Lufthansa. * A passenger who books a trip from London to Strasbourg with Air France only flies as far as Paris, where they transfer to a TGV train to Strasbourg. In March 2019, Dutch Infrastructure Minister Cora van Nieuwenhuizen stated the government was working on a combined train/plane ticket, so that 'a Mexican wanting to go to Brussels via Amsterdam could book their journey from Mexico via NS International or Thalys in one go,' making an Amsterdam‚ÄìBrussels flight unnecessary. = Taxation and subsidies = Financial measures can be taken to discourage passengers and airlines from flying in general, and to seek other means of transportation (passengers) or develop more fuel-efficient or less-polluting ways of flying (airlines). The primary means of taxation are: * Air passenger taxes, paid by passengers to the government for environmental reasons; may be variable by distance and includes domestic flights ** Departure taxes, paid by passengers leaving the country to the government (sometimes also applies outside of aviation) * Jet fuel taxes, paid by airline companies to the government for the jet fuel (kerosene) they burn ** For the European Union, see Kerosene tax ** For the United States, see Fuel taxes in the United State ¬ß Aviation fuel taxes It's also possible to influence business practices and consumer behaviour by cutting subsidies for unsustainable aviation, or by subsidising the development of more sustainable alternatives both in aviation and other means of transportation wherever aviation can be replaced, such as railway systems. In a September‚ÄìOctober 2019 poll conducted by the European Investment Bank (EIB) amongst 28,088 EU citizens from the then 28 member states, 72% said they would support a carbon tax on flights.  International regulation of air travel GHG emissions  = Kyoto Protocol 2005 = Greenhouse gas emissions from fuel consumption in international aviation, in contrast to those from domestic aviation and from energy use by airports, are excluded from the scope of the first period (2008‚Äì2012) of the Kyoto Protocol, as are the non-CO2 climate effects. Instead, governments agreed to work through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to limit or reduce emissions and to find a solution to the allocation of emissions from international aviation in time for the second period of the Kyoto Protocol starting from 2009; however, the Copenhagen climate conference failed to reach an agreement.GreenAirOnline (2009, 22-Dec). Copenhagen's failure to deliver an aviation emissions deal leaves sector facing an uncertain future. Recent research points to this failure as a substantial obstacle to global policy including a emissions reduction pathway that would avoid dangerous climate change by keeping the increase in the average global temperature below a 2 ¬∞C rise.RTCC (2014). [Planes and ships escape scrutiny in bottom-up climate regime http://www.rtcc.org/2014/12/22/planes-and-ships-escape-scrutiny-in- bottom-up-climate-regime/ ].

(2012). Aviation and shipping privileged ‚Äì again? UK delays decision to act on emissions. Briefing Note No. 47; Tyndall Cent. for Clim. Chg. Research. Dec. 2012. = Approaches toward emissions trading = As part of that process the ICAO has endorsed the adoption of an open emissions trading system to meet CO2 emissions reduction objectives. Guidelines for the adoption and implementation of a global scheme are currently being developed, and were to be presented to the ICAO Assembly in 2007,ICAO news release 30 November 2005 \\"ICAO is also considering market-based options to address engine emissions through the participation of aviation in emissions trading schemes and the use of emissions levies related to local air quality. Guidelines for Contracting States wishing to implement such measures are being formulated and should be completed in time for the next regular Session of the ICAO Assembly in the Fall of 2007, when direction for future action will be set.\\" although the prospects of a comprehensive inter- governmental agreement on the adoption of such a scheme are uncertain. Within the European Union, however, the European Commission has resolved to incorporate aviation in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS, established by Directive 2003/87/EC alias the Emission Trading Directive).European Commission, Reducing the Climate Change Impact of Aviation (2005) A new directive, Directive 2003/87/EC (amending Directive 2003/87/EC to include aviation), was adopted by the European Parliament in July 2008 and approved by the Council in October 2008. It became effective on 1 January 2012.Directive 2008/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 amending Directive 2003/87/EC so as to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community (Text with EEA relevance) Another one, Directive 2008/50/EC or the Ambient Air Quality Directive, limits sulphur dioxide, NO2 and other oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter (PM10, PM2,5), lead, benzene and carbon monoxide emissions from 2010. Hourly average emissions of NO2 are limited 200 Œºg/m3 and yearly to 40 Œºg/m3. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute investigated the possible effects on Small Island Developing States (SIDS) of the European Union's decision to limit the supply of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) to its ETS market to Least Developed Countries (LDCs) from 2013.Keane, J. (2012) Briefing paper: The aviation industry, the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme and Small and Vulnerable Economies: development-friendly frameworks. Overseas Development Institute Most SIDS are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and rely heavily on tourism as a basis for their economies, so this decision could place them at some disadvantage. The researchers therefore highlight the need to ensure that any regulatory frameworks put in place to tackle climate change take into account the development needs of the most vulnerable countries affected. A report published by researchers at the Centre for Aviation, Transport and Environment at Manchester Metropolitan University found that the only way to have a significant impact on emissions was to put a price on carbon and to use a market-based measure (MBM), such as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).Lee, D. et al 2013 Briefing paper: Bridging the aviation CO2 emissions gap: why emissions trading is needed. Centre for Aviation, Transport and the Environment = International Civil Aviation Organization agreement 2016 = In October 2016 the UN agency International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) finalized an agreement among its 191 member nations to address the more than (2010) of carbon dioxide emitted annually by international passenger and cargo flights. The agreement will use an offsetting scheme called CORSIA (the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) under which forestry and other carbon-reducing activities are directly funded, amounting to about two percent of annual revenues for the sector. Rules against \\"double counting\\" should ensure that existing forest protection efforts are not recycled. The scheme does not take effect until 2021 and will be voluntary until 2027, but many countries, including the US and China, have promised to begin at its 2020 inception date. Under the agreement, the global aviation emissions target is a 50 percent reduction by 2050 relative to 2005. NGO reaction to the deal was mixed. The agreement has critics. It is not aligned with the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which set the objective of restricting global warming to 1.5 to 2 ¬∞C. A late draft of the agreement would have required the air transport industry to assess its share of global carbon budgeting to meet that objective, but the text was removed in the agreed version.UN aviation pact will not be aligned with Paris climate goals, M. Darby, Climate Change News, 6 October 2016.The new UN deal on aviation emissions leaves much to be desired, D. Hodgkinson & R. Johnston. The Conversation, 10 October 2016. CORSIA will regulate only about 25 percent of aviation's international emissions, since it grandfather's all emissions below the 2020 level, allowing unregulated growth until then.Weak Market-based Measure Allows Airplanes' Greenhouse Pollution to Triple, (Press release) Center for Biological Diversity and Friends of the Earth. 6 October 2016. Only 65 nations will participate in the initial voluntary period, not including significant emitters Russia, India and perhaps Brazil. The agreement does not cover domestic emissions, which are 40 percent of the global industry's overall emissions. One observer of the ICAO convention made this summary, \\"Airline claims that flying will now be green are a myth. Taking a plane is the fastest and cheapest way to fry the planet and this deal won't reduce demand for jet fuel one drop. Instead offsetting aims to cut emissions in other industries,...\\" Another critic called it \\"a timid step in the right direction.\\"Green Groups Warn Deal to Lower Aviation Pollution is 'Weak Shell Game', N. Prupis, Common Dreams, 6 October 2016  Methods of mitigating aviation's CO2 emissions  Mitigation of aviation's environmental impact can be achieved through a variety of measures, the most obvious and arguably the most economical of which is to reduce the fuel burn of the aircraft as this accounts for 28% of an airlines costs. However, there is a wide variety of other options available to minimise aviation's growing impact upon the environment as are listed below: = Aircraft efficiency = The Boeing 787 Dreamliner promises to provide 20% lower fuel burn than current-generation aircraft. Reducing the direct fuel burn of an aircraft is the most obvious and arguably the most economical way of reducing emissions attributable to aviation. Over the years 1977‚Äì2007, commercial jet airliners have become 70% more fuel efficient, and have been predicted to be another 25% more fuel- efficient by 2025 according to Giovanni Bisignani. The next-generation of aircraft, including the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Airbus A350 and Bombardier CSeries, are 20% more fuel efficient per passenger kilometre than current generation aircraft. This is primarily achieved through more fuel-efficient engines and lighter airframes & supporting structures made of composite materials but is also achieved through more aerodynamic shapes, winglets, a \\"one-piece\\" fuselage and more advanced computer systems for optimising routes and loading of the aircraft. While late model jet aircraft are significantly more fuel efficient (and thus emit less in particular) than the earliest jet airliners,IATA/ATAG, Aviation & the Environment (1999) \\"Aircraft fuel efficiency has improved by some 50 percent over the past 30 years\\"Peeters P.M., Middel J., Hoolhorst A. (2005). Fuel efficiency of commercial aircraft ‚Äî An overview of historical and future trends. National Aerospace Laboratory. NLR-CR-2005-669, 37pp. new airliner models in the 2000s were barely more efficient on a seat-mile basis than the latest piston-powered airliners of the late-1950s (e.g., Constellation L-1649-A and DC-7C). Claims for a high gain in efficiency for airliners over recent decades (while true in part) has been biased high in most studies, by using the early inefficient models of jet airliners as a baseline. Those aircraft were optimized for increased revenue, including increased speed and cruising altitude, and were quite fuel inefficient in comparison to their piston-powered forerunners. Today, turboprop aircraft ‚Äì probably in part because of their lower cruising speeds and altitudes (similar to the earlier piston-powered airliners) compared to jet airliners ‚Äì play an obvious role in the overall fuel efficiency of major airlines that have regional carrier subsidiaries.Back to the Future: Return of the Turboprop?. By Irene Kwan. Int'l Counc. on Clean Transport. 3 June 2014. For example, although Alaska Airlines scored at the top of a 2011‚Äì2012 fuel efficiency ranking, if its large regional carrier ‚Äì turbo-prop equipped Horizon Air ‚Äì were dropped from the lumped-in consideration, the airline's ranking would be somewhat lower, as noted in the ranking study. Aircraft manufacturers are striving for reductions in both and NOx emissions with each new generation of design of aircraft and engine.Advisory Council for Aeronautical Research in Europe (ACARE) Strategic Research Agenda (2002) \\"These objectives include, inter alia, a 50 percent cut in and 80 percent in Nox emissions\\" [for new aircraft introduced in 2020 relative to new aircraft introduced in 2000]. While the introduction of more modern aircraft represents an opportunity to reduce emissions per passenger kilometre flown, aircraft are major investments that endure for many decades, and replacement of the international fleet is therefore a long-term proposition which will greatly delay realizing the climate benefits of many kinds of improvements. Engines can be changed at some point, but nevertheless airframes have a long life. Moreover, rather than being linear from one year to the next the improvements to efficiency tend to diminish over time, as reflected in the histories of both piston and jet powered aircraft. A 2014 life-cycle assessment of the cradle-to-grave reduction in CO2 by a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) airliner such as a Boeing 787‚Äîincluding its manufacture, operations and eventual disposal‚Äîhas shown that by 2050 such aircraft could reduce the airline industry's CO2 emissions by 14‚Äì15 percent, compared use of conventional airliners. The benefit of CFRP technology is not higher than that amount of reduction, despite the lighter weight and substantially lower fuel consumption of such aircraft, \\"because of the limited fleet penetration by 2050 and the increased demand for air travel due to lower operating costs\\" (rebound effect). = Alternative fuels = Some scientists and companies such as GE Aviation and Virgin Fuels are researching biofuel technology for use in jet aircraft. Some aircraft engines, like the Wilksch WAM120 can (being a 2-stroke Diesel engine) run on straight vegetable oil. Also, a number of Lycoming engines run well on ethanol. Biofuels are fuels derived from biomass material such as plants and waste. Plant derived biofuels offer large savings in CO2 emissions as they absorb Carbon Dioxide and release it as Oxygen when they grow and so in a life-cycle, emissions can be drastically reduced. A number of airlines have operated biofuel test flights including Virgin Atlantic, which flew with one engine operating on a blend of 20% coconut oil and 80% traditional jet fuel, and Continental Airlines which flew with one engine operating on a blend of 44% Jatropha oil, 6% Algae oil and 50% traditional jet fuel. Other airlines to demonstrate biofuels include Air New Zealand and Japan Airlines. In the 2009 Continental Airlines test, the engine running partly on biofuel burned 46 kg less fuel than the conventionally fuelled engine in 1 and a half hours while producing more thrust from the same volume of fuel. Continental Airlines' CEO, Larry Kellner, commented \\"This is a good step forward, an opportunity to really make a difference to the environment\\" citing jatropha's 50‚Äì80% lower CO2 emissions as opposed to Jet-A1 in its lifecycle.\\"A Greener Future?\\" - Aircraft Illustrated, March 2009 In addition, there are also several tests done combining regular petrofuels with a biofuel. For example, as part of this test Virgin Atlantic flew a Boeing 747 from London Heathrow to Amsterdam Schiphol on 24 February 2008, with one engine burning a combination of coconut oil and babassu oil. Greenpeace's chief scientist Doug Parr said that the flight was \\"high-altitude greenwash\\" and that producing organic oils to make biofuel could lead to deforestation and a large increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Also, the majority of the world's aircraft are not large jetliners but smaller piston aircraft, and with major modifications many are capable of using ethanol as a fuel. Another consideration is the vast amount of land that would be necessary to provide the biomass feedstock needed to support the needs of aviation, both civil and military.Rapier R (2011, 20-Jan). Marginal Land Produces Marginal Biomass. Consumer Energy Report In December 2008, an Air New Zealand jet completed the world's first commercial aviation test flight partially using jatropha-based fuel. Jatropha, used for biodiesel, can thrive on marginal agricultural land where many trees and crops won't grow, or would produce only slow growth yields.Ron Oxburgh. Through biofuels we can reap the fruits of our labours The Guardian, 28 February 2008. Retrieved 24 December 2008.Patrick Barta. As Biofuels Catch On, Next Task Is to Deal With Environmental, Economic Impact Wall Street Journal, 24 March 2008. Retrieved 24 December 2008. Air New Zealand set several general sustainability criteria for its Jatropha, saying that such biofuels must not compete with food resources, that they must be as good as traditional jet fuels, and that they should be cost competitive with existing fuels.Air New Zealand Completes Biofuel Test GreenBiz.com, 5 January 2009. Retrieved 5 January 2009. In January 2009, Continental Airlines used a sustainable biofuel to power a commercial aircraft for the first time in North America. This marks the first sustainable biofuel demonstration flight by a commercial carrier using a twin-engined aircraft, a Boeing 737-800, powered by CFM International CFM56-7B engines. The biofuel blend included components derived from algae and jatropha plants.Sustainable flight The Engineer Online, 12 January 2009. Retrieved 12 January 2009. British Airways will be using half a million tonnes of waste annually to create biofuels for commercial use from 2014 onwards. One fuel biofuel alternative to avgas that is under development is Swift Fuel. Swift fuel was approved as a test fuel by ASTM International in December 2009, allowing the company to continue their research and to pursue certification testing. Mary Rusek, president and co-owner of Swift Enterprises predicted at that time that \\"100SF will be comparably priced, environmentally friendlier and more fuel-efficient than other general aviation fuels on the market\\". As of June 2011, revised international aviation fuel standards officially allow commercial airlines to blend conventional jet fuel with up to 50 percent biofuels. The renewable fuels \\"can be blended with conventional commercial and military jet fuel through requirements in the newly issued edition of ASTM D7566, Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons\\". In December 2011, the FAA announced it is awarding US$7.7 million to eight companies to advance the development of drop-in commercial aviation biofuels, with a special focus on ATJ (alcohol to jet) fuel. As part of its CAAFI (Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuel Initiative) and CLEEN (Continuous Lower Emissions, Energy and Noise) programs, the FAA plans to assist in the development of a sustainable fuel (from alcohols, sugars, biomass, and organic matter such as pyrolysis oils) that can be \\"dropped in\\" to aircraft without changing current infrastructure. The grant will also be used to research how the fuels affect engine durability and quality control standards. From 2014 onwards, British Airways, in co-operation with Solena, is going to turn half a million tonnes of waste annually that would normally go to landfill from the City of London into biofuel to be used in the British Airways fleet. Waste derived biofuel produces up to 95% less pollution in its life-cycle and so therefore this measure will reduce emissions by the equivalent of taking 42,000 cars off the road every year. By 2020, IAG had invested $400 million to convert waste into sustainable aviation fuel with Velocys. Finally, liquified natural gas is another fuel that is used in some airplanes. Besides the lower GHG emissions (depending on where the natural gas is obtained), another major benefit to airplane operators is the price, which is far lower than the price for jet fuel. Airbus hopes to have a commercial jet hydrogen-powered aircraft by the early 2030s. = Operations efficiency = Scandinavian Airlines is operating their Boeing 737 aircraft at slower cruising speeds to reduce emissions by 7‚Äì8%. Research projects such as Boeing's ecoDemonstrator program have sought to identify ways of improving the efficiency of commercial aircraft operations. The U.S. government has encouraged such research through grant programs, including the FAA's Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions and Noise (CLEEN) program, and NASA's Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) Project. Adding an electric drive to the airplane's nose wheel may improve fuel efficiency during ground handling. This addition would allow taxiing without the use of the main engines.EOS magazine November 2011Fuel Cell-powered Electric Nose Wheel Nears Flight Tests , EV World, 9 February 2011.Tests prove electric-drive concept, Flight Global 9 August 2005. Another proposed change is the integrating of an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System to the airstrips of airports. Some companies such as Airbus are currently researching this possibility. The adding of EMALS would allow the civilian aircraft to use considerably less fuel (as a lot of fuel is used during take off, in comparison to cruising, when calculated per km flown). The idea is to have the aircraft take off at regular aircraft speed, and only use the catapult for take-off, not for landing. Other opportunities arise from the optimization of airline timetables, route networks and flight frequencies to increase load factors (minimize the number of empty seats flown),International Civil Aviation Organization Operational Opportunities to Minimize Fuel Use and Reduce Emissions (2001) together with the optimization of airspace. However, these are each one-time gains, and as these opportunities are successively fulfilled, diminishing returns can be expected from the remaining opportunities. Another possible reduction of the climate-change impact is the limitation of cruise altitude of aircraft. This would lead to a significant reduction in high-altitude contrails for a marginal trade-off of increased flight time and an estimated 4 percent increase in CO2 emissions. Drawbacks of this solution include very limited airspace capacity to do this, especially in Europe and North America and increased fuel burn because jet aircraft are less efficient at lower cruise altitudes. The warming effect of contrails can also be reduced by 3/5 by going below or above wide and flat areas of cold, humid weather that cause the cloud cover to form. While they are not suitable for long-haul or transoceanic flights, turboprop aircraft used for commuter flights bring two significant benefits: they often burn considerably less fuel per passenger mile, and they typically fly at lower altitudes, well inside the tropopause, where there are no concerns about ozone or contrail production. Airlines and airports are looking at ways of reducing emissions and fuel burn through the use of improved operating procedures. Two of the more common ones in operation are a single-engine taxi to and from the runway and the use of a Continuous Descent Approach, or CDA, which can reduce emissions significantly during the operations in and around an airport. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) is now operating its Boeing 737 fleet at a slower cruising speed to help reduce emissions by 7‚Äì8%.  Methods of mitigating aviation's non-CO2 emissions  Aviation produces a number of other pollutants besides carbon dioxide including nitrogen oxides (NOX), particulates, unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) and contrails. A number of methods to reduce the level of these pollutants follows: = Nitrogen oxides (NOX) = Nitrogen oxides have a far stronger impact upon climate change than Carbon Oxides and are produced in small quantities from aircraft engines. Engine designers have worked since the start of the jet age to reduce NOX emissions and the result is ever reducing levels of nitrogen oxide emissions. For example, between 1997 and 2003, NOX emissions from jet engines fell by over 40%.Rolls-Royce - The Jet Engine - = Particulates = Particulates and smoke were a problem with early jet engines at high power settings but modern engines are designed so that no smoke is produced at any point in the flight. = Unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) = Contrails formed by high altitude aircraft. Unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) are products of incomplete combustion of fuel and are produced in greater quantities in engines with low pressure gains in the compressors and/or relatively low temperatures in the combustor. As with particulates, UHC has all but been eliminated in modern jet engines through improved design and technology. = Contrails = Aircraft flying at high altitude form condensation trails or contrails in the exhaust plume of their engines. While in the Troposphere these have very little climatic impact. However, jet aircraft cruising in the Stratosphere do create an impact from their contrails, although the extent of the damage to the environment is as yet unknown. Contrails can also trigger the formation of high-altitude Cirrus cloud thus creating a greater climatic effect. A 2015 study found that artificial cloudiness caused by contrail \\"outbreaks\\" reduce the difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures. The former are decreased and the latter are increased, in comparison to temperatures the day before and the day after such outbreaks.Bernhardt, J. & Carleton, A.M. (2015). The impacts of long-lived jet contrail ‚Äòoutbreaks‚Äô on surface station diurnal temperature range. Jrnl of Int'l Climatology. Online-early (July). On days with outbreaks the day/night temperature difference was diminished by about 6F¬∞ in the U.S. South and 5F¬∞ in the Midwest.Jet contrails affect surface temperatures. Science Daily. June 18, 2015. In the three days following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, when no commercial aircraft flew in the United States, climate scientists measured the daily temperature range over 5000 weather stations across the USA. The results showed a 1 ¬∞ Celsius change in the average daily temperature range for those days of the year, thus showing contrails do have a significant impact on climate. Potential ways of reducing the impact of contrails on our climate include reducing the maximum cruising altitude of aircraft so high-altitude contrails can not form. Cruising at lower altitudes would marginally increase flight time and increase fuel consumption by 4%.  Methods of mitigating aviation's noise emissions  Serrated edges of the nacelle on the Rolls- Royce Trent 1000 fitted to a Boeing 787 One of the by-products of an aircraft's engine is noise and this has become an increasingly important issue which is being dealt with through many different methods: = Engines = Next-Generation engines are not only more fuel-efficient but also tend to be quieter with Pratt & Whitney's PurePower PW1000G fitted to the Bombardier CSeries aircraft being 4 times quieter than aircraft currently in service. Engines can also incorporate serrated edges or 'chevrons' on the back of the nacelle to reduce noise impact as shown in this picture. = Continuous Descent Approach = A Continuous Descent Approach, or CDA, not only reduces fuel burn but also allows airlines to provide quieter approaches for part of the descent to a runway. As the engines are at close to idle power, less noise emissions are produced and combined with new engine technology, the reductions in noise emissions can be large.  Carbon offsetting  wind farms. A carbon offset is a means of compensating aviation emissions by saving enough carbon or absorbing carbon back into plants (for example, by planting trees through reforestation or afforestation) to balance the carbon emitted by a particular action. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation envisions an industry-wide cap of greenhouse gas emissions at 2020 levels, with mandatory participation for developed countries starting in 2026. In UK, transport replaced power as the largest emissions source, including aviation for 4%, expanding until 2050, and passenger demand may have to be reduced. For the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) of the UK government, the UK target of an 80% reduction from 1990 to 2050 is still achievable but the Paris Agreement should tighten emissions targets. Their position is that emissions in problematic sectors, like aviation, should be offset by greenhouse gas removal, carbon capture and storage, and reforestation. = Consumer option = Several airlines have begun offering carbon offsets to passengers to offset the emissions created by their proportion of the flight. Money generated is put to projects around the world to invest in green technology such as renewable energy and research into future technology. Airlines offering carbon offsets include Air Canada, Air New Zealand, British Airways, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, easyJet, Emirates Airlines, Gulf Air, Jetstar, Lufthansa, Qantas, United Airlines, and Virgin Australia. 11 Airlines That Offer Carbon Offset Programs Consumers can also purchase offsets on the individual market. Experts recommendHow to Buy Carbon Offsets looking for certifications from Gold StandardThe Gold Standard or Green-e.Find Green-e Certified Carbon Offsets = Airline efforts = On 1 October 2019, Air France announced it will offset CO‚ÇÇ emissions on its 450 daily domestic flights for 57,000 passengers from 1 January 2020, through certified projects. The company will also offer its customers to voluntary compensate all their flights and aims to reduce its emissions by 50% per pax/km in 2030 compared to 2005. Starting in November 2019, UK budget carrier EasyJet decided to offset carbon emissions for all its flights, through investments in atmospheric carbon reduction projects. It claims to be the first major operator to be carbon neutral, at a cost of ¬£25 million for its 2019-20 financial year. Its CO‚ÇÇ emissions were 77g per passenger in its 2018-19 financial year, down from 78.4g the previous year. From 1 January 2020, British Airways began offsetting its 75 daily domestic flights emissions through carbon-reduction projects investments. The airline seeks to become carbon neutral by 2050 with fuel-efficient aircraft, sustainable fuels, and operations changes. Passengers flying overseas can offset their flights for ¬£1 to Madrid in economy or ¬£15 to New York in business-class. US low-cost carrier JetBlue plans to use offsets for its emissions from domestic flights starting in July 2020, the first major US airline to do so. It also plans to use sustainable aviation fuel made from waste by Finnish refiner Neste starting in mid-2020. In August 2020, JetBlue became entirely carbon-neutral for its U.S. domestic flights, using efficiency improvements and carbon offsets.All JetBlue Flights Are Now Carbon Neutral Within The US Delta pledged to do the same within ten years.Delta burns tons of jet fuel - but says it's on track to be carbon neutral. What?  Electric aircraft  Technological developments have enabled some small planes to fly on electricity alone. Electric aircraft do not emit greenhouse gases and can be charged with renewable energy. As of May 2020, the largest airplane to make a successful flight (of 30 minutes) was a modified Cessna 208B Caravan, capable of transporting nine passengers and a pilot. The electricity for this flight cost US$6 (¬£4.80), while conventional fuel for a 30-minute flight would have cost US$300‚Äì400 (¬£240‚Äì320). However, current lithium-ion batteries' maximum energy density is 250 watt-hours (Wh) per kilogram (kg), while the energy density of kerosene (jet fuel) is around 12,000 Wh per kg. This means electric planes need to carry relatively heavy batteries and thus have much shorter ranges than fossil-fuelled planes. Therefore, they are currently not an option for long-haul airliners. Experts estimate that large electric planes will not be available before 2040, full electrification of all aviation will not be possible before 2070, perhaps not even within the 21st century, although smaller aircraft are probably good candidates for early adoption. For the UK's Committee on Climate Change (CCC), huge technology shifts are uncertain, but consultancy Roland Berger points to 80 new electric aircraft programmes in 2016‚Äì2018, all-electric for the smaller two-thirds and hybrid for larger aircraft, with forecast commercial service dates in the early 2030s on short-haul routes like London to Paris, with all- electric aircraft not expected before 2045. Berger predicts a 24% CO2 share for aviation by 2050 if fuel efficiency improves by 1% per year and if there are no electric or hybrid aircraft, dropping to 3‚Äì6% if 10-year-old aircraft are replaced by electric or hybrid aircraft due to regulatory constraints, starting in 2030, to reach 70% of the 2050 fleet. This would greatly reduce the value of the existing fleet of aircraft, however. Limits to the supply of battery cells could hamper their aviation adoption, as they compete with other industries like electric vehicles. Lithium-ion batteries have proven fragile and fire-prone, and their capacity deteriorates with age. However, alternatives are being pursued, such as sodium-ion batteries.

The Kerala Public Service Commission is a body created by the Constitution of India. The Commission advise the Government on all matters relating to civil services referred to it under Article 320 (3) of the Constitution and publish notifications inviting applications for selection to various posts as per the requisitions of the appointing authorities, conduct written test and/or practical tests, physical efficiency test and interview, prepare ranked list based on the performance of the candidates and advise candidates for appointment strictly based on their merit and observing the rules of reservation as and when vacancies are reported. History There was a Public Service Commissioner in the erstwhile Travancore state whose duty was to select candidates for direct recruitment to various categories of posts under the Government. G.D. Nokes was appointed as the first Public Service Commissioner on 14 June 1936. The Office of the Public Service Commissioner, Travancore continued to function till the integration of Travancore and Cochin States. In Cochin there was a Staff Selection Board constituted in 1936 to select candidates for initial recruitment to lower posts. In 1947 a three- member Cochin Public Service Commission was constituted under an Act of the State Legislature. The Travancore-Cochin State was formed on 1 July 1949 by the integration of the two Princely States of Travancore and Cochin. With the integration of the States of Travancore and Cochin on 1 July 1949 a Public Service Commission for the State of Travancore-Cochin was constituted by an Ordinance. There were three members on the Commission including the Chairman. The functions of the Travancore-Cochin Public Service Commission were generally the same as those laid down in the Government of India Act, 1935. Later, when the Constitution of India came into force on 26 January 1950, the Travancore-Cochin Public Service Commission continued to function under the Constitutional Provisions. The State of Kerala was formed on 1 November 1956 consequent on the Reorganisation of States. It comprises the former Travancore-Cochin State (except the present Kanyakumari District and Shencottah Taluk of the present Tamil Nadu) and the Malabar District and the Kasargod Taluk of South Kanara District of the then composite Madras State. With the formation of the State of Kerala on 1 November 1956 as a result of the reorganisation of States, the Travancore-Cochin Public Service Commission was transformed into the Kerala Public Service Commission. V.K. Velayudhan was the 1st Chairman of Kerala Public Service Commission. The number of the Members of the Commission was increased to Five in 1959, to Seven in 1971, to Eight in 1981, to Nine in 1982, to Thirteen in 1983, to Fourteen in 1984, to Fifteen in 1984 and to the present strength of Eighteen in 2005.

He started his football career as a centre forward in Ikonomos Tsaritsanis and in 1981 he signed with AEL where he played one year as a forward. In 1982 the coach of Larissa used him as a sweeper, and as a defender Mitsibonas made a great career. With Larissa he won a Greek football Cup in 1985 and a Greek football Championship in 1988. This championship was and still remains a huge success, as Larissa became the first and the only until now countryside based team to win the Greek championship. Mitsibonas is believed to be the best Larissa defender and one of the greatest Greek defenders in history. In 1989, he moved to PAOK and three years later he signed with the team of Olympiacos where he won a Greek football Cup. In 1994, he returned to Larissa, but nothing was like before. Many good players had left the team and Larissa eventually in 1996 failed to remain in the first division.

Nabokov was so displeased by the translation's quality that he undertook his own, which was published in 1938 under the now common name, Laughter in the Dark. It is sometimes mistakenly assumed that he was not fond of the book, yet in fact it was based on very personal breakthroughs in his life. The book deals with the affection of a middle-aged man for a very young woman, resulting in a mutually parasitic relationship. In 1955, Nabokov used this theme again with Lolita to a much differently developed effect. Characters The characters were given different names in the English translation. In the following list the names of the main characters of the English translation are given first with the original names in parentheses. * Albert Albinus (Bruno Krechmar) - a middle- aged art-critic * Margot Peters (Magda Peters) - a 17-year-old aspiring actress, common worker, model, seductress * Axel Rex (Robert Gorn, probably Robert Horn) - A painter from New York and Margot's first lover, also Margot's first broken relationship when he abandoned her Some minor characters include (from the English version): * Elisabeth Albinus - Albert Albinus's wife * Paul Hochenwart - Elisabeth's brother * Otto Peters - Margot's brother * Frieda - The Albinus' housekeeper * Irma Albinus - Elisabeth and Albert's daughter * Kaspar - A friend of Otto's * Udo Conrad - An author and acquaintance of Albert's Plot Albinus is a respected, reasonably happy married art critic who lives in Berlin. He lusts after the 17-year-old Margot whom he meets at a cinema, where she works, and woos her over the course of many encounters, primarily with money. His prolonged affair with Margot is eventually revealed to Albinus's wife Elisabeth when Margot deliberately sends a letter to the Albinuses' residence and Albinus is unable to intercept it before it is discovered. Elisabeth leaves with the assistance of her brother, Paul, and takes their daughter, Irma, with her. Rather than disown the young troublemaker, Albinus is even more attracted to Margot. She eventually manipulates him into allowing her to move in to his flat where he resided with his wife, and she sets to working on him getting a divorce so that she might marry him and acquire access to his significant wealth. Margot uses Albinus to fulfill her ambition in life to become a rich film star. Even when Albinus' daughter, Irma, takes ill and eventually succumbs to pneumonia, Margot insistently drives a wedge between his old life and his new, in order to totalize her capture of him. Inadvertently, Albinus introduces Margot to Axel Rex at one of his many dinner parties, but he does not know that the two have previously been lovers. Margot and Rex resume their relationship, and start plotting to get Albinus out of the way and rob him of his money. Albinus gets Margot her first role as an actress, using his wealth as largesse to make up for her lack of talent. At the premiere viewing of the movie, Margot realises how inept she was and is petulant about her public exposure as a mediocre actress. Attempting to appease her wounded ego, Albinus convinces her to take a holiday to the south in the new car he has bought for her. Rex refuses to be left behind, and by this point has wangled his way into Albinus' confidence as a fellow artist (including convincing Albinus that he could not possibly be interested in Margot as he poses himself as homosexual): he presents himself as the ideal chauffeur for their trip, given that Albinus can barely drive. Rex and Margot's trysts have become increasingly brazen, and the holiday seems an opportunity to further deepen their affair on Albinus' payroll. The holiday didn't quite go as Margot and Rex planned, since rendezvouses were next to impossible without arousing suspicion. On arriving in a small town and finding most lodgings unavailable, they finally get their chance in the only remaining hotel room the three could find, which shared a bathroom and made clandestine access possible. After a chance encounter with an old friend in the town, Albinus realises that Margot and Rex are engaged in an affair. Enraged, Albinus returns to the hotel and threatens Margot, who insists that there is nothing between her and the allegedly homosexual Rex. Still distraught, Albinus demands they leave at once, and they abandon Rex at the hotel. On their journey out of town, Albinus crashes the car and is blinded, leaving him in need of care and oblivious to the world around him. Rex and Margot take advantage of his handicap. After sending a letter falsely stating that Rex has gone to America, they rent a chalet in Switzerland where Rex poses as Albinus's doctor, although Albinus is unaware of Rex's presence. Rex mocks and tortures Albinus during his recovery. Albinus becomes increasingly suspicious as his ears become more attuned and he perceives someone's presence, although Margot continuously denies his concerns. Paul, Albinus's brother-in-law, suspects forgery when he encounters multiple high value cheques on Albinus' account at their shared bank, with the signature scrawled and the amounts in a different handwriting (Rex and Margot have been bleeding Albinus's accounts dry and coercing him into signing blind). Elisabeth, Albinus' estranged wife, asks her brother to drive to the Swiss residence. There, Paul discovers Rex toying with Albinus in his blinded state while Margot is out. Paul hurriedly bundles Albinus into a vehicle before Margot can return and convince the wretched Albinus otherwise, and escorts Albinus back to the Elisabeth's home, where he is given proper care. After a short time, Albinus receives a call from the porter at his old original Berlin flat informing him that Margot has returned to his flat to collect some things. Finally knowing where she is, he decides to kill her. Without haste, he makes his way to the familiar flat and traps her inside by barricading the door, intending to shoot her with his pistol. He seeks her out by her scent and faint sounds, but when he tries to shoot her she overpowers him, grabs the pistol, and kills him. Film adaptation In 1969, Laughter in the Dark was adapted for film directed by Tony Richardson, which was originally intended to star Richard Burton as Albinus. When he was fired for drunkenness, he was replaced by Nicol Williamson. Anna Karina played Margot and Jean-Claude Drouot played Axel Rex.

Early life Vera was born into the family of an impoverished merchant (later an accountant) in Rostov-on-Don, Russia. Her father, Fyodor Ivanovich Panov, built canoes and yachts as a hobby, and founded two yachting clubs in Rostov. When she was five her father drowned in the Don River. After her father's death, her mother worked as a saleswoman. As a girl she was taught by a family friend, an old school teacher named Anna Prozorovskaya. Vera credited Anna with instilling in her a passion for reading. Anna died after being with Vera for only a year. Prior to the October Revolution she studied for 2 years at a private gymnasium, before her formal education was stopped because of money problems in her family. From her earliest years Vera was an avid reader, especially of poetry, at which she tried her hand at an early age. Her reading included the works of Alexander Pushkin, Nikolay Gogol, and Ivan Turgenev. She also read numerous textbooks on science, geography, and history as a form of self-education. At the age of 17 she started working as a journalist on the Rostov newspaper Trudovoy Don (Working Don), publishing articles as V. Staroselskaya (the surname of her first husband Arseny Staroselsky whom she had married in 1925 and divorced 2 years later) and Vera Veltman. She described her first editing job and her first steps in this career in her novel Sentimental Romance (1958). She learned newspaper work by experience, serving in turn as an assistant to the district organizer of labor correspondents, a reporter, and an essayist. Career In 1933 she began writing plays. In 1935 her second husband, Komsomolskaya Pravda journalist Boris Vakhtin, was arrested and imprisoned on Solovki where he died (the exact death date is unknown, probably the later thirties). The Gulag authorities allowed her only one meeting with Boris, which she described in her story Svidanie (The Meeting). From 1940 she lived in Leningrad. The unexpected advance of the Nazis on the Leningrad Front found her in Tsarskoe Selo. She and her daughter were put in a concentration camp near Pskov, but they managed to escape to Narva, where they lived illegally in a destroyed synagogue. She then moved to the village of Shishaki to stay with relatives. There she began her first serious works, the plays Ivan Kosogor (1939) and In Old Moscow (1940). Although these 2 plays won prizes, Vera felt that the dramatic form confined her, and, by her own admission, she was unable to fit all that she wanted to say into its strict framework. She felt that she could work with greater freedom in the novel and story forms. In 1943, when the Germans retreated from Ukraine, she moved to Perm (called Molotov at that time). She worked for a local newspaper and published her first novel The Pirozhkov Family (later renamed Yevdokia, the source of a Soviet film produced by Tatyana Lioznova in 1961). In 1944, as a journalist, she was embedded for two months with a hospital train about which she wrote the novel Sputniki (1946; translated as The Train) that brought her a Stalin Prize in 1947. There was a Soviet Film Poezd miloserdiya (Train of Mercy, 1961) and another TV-film Na vsyu ostavshuyuysya zhizn' (For the Rest of One's Life, 1975) based on the novel; the scenario for the later film was written by Panova's son Boris Vakhtin. In 1945 she married David Yakovlevich Ryvkin (1910-1980), a notable Russian science-fiction writer who wrote under the pseudonym of \\"David Dar\\". Together with her husband and his 2 children and her own family she returned to Leningrad. In 1947 she published the novel Kruzhilikha, translated as Looking Ahead (Stalin Prize in 1948), about people working in a Ural factory. She had begun writing the novel in 1944, but had been interrupted by the hospital train assignment. In 1949 she wrote the novel Yasny Bereg (Bright Shore; Stalin Prize of 1950) about people working in a kolkhoz. With the onset of the Khrushchev Thaw she wrote Vremena Goda (Span of the Year, 1953) about the relations of fathers and sons within the Soviet intelligentsia. The novel was immensely popular with the reading public, but Panova was criticized harshly in the press for her \\"naturalism\\" and \\"objectivism\\". In 1955 she wrote the novel Seryozha, one of the best works about children in Soviet literature. She published the stories Valya and Volodya, also about children, in 1959. Panova held a place among the top Soviet writers. At the Writer's Congresses of 1954 and 1959 she was elected as a member of the Presidium of the Union of Soviet Writers. She was twice awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1955, 1965). As an established writer she was allowed to travel to England, Scotland, and Italy, and in 1960 she toured the United States. Her published travel notes and articles, and an epilogue to the Russian translation of The Catcher in the Rye, by J.D. Salinger, show her affinity for Western life and culture. Later life In her later life she published many works of fiction (most of them autobiographical or based on Russian history of the 17th century), plays, and film scripts. She helped many younger writers who later become famous, among them Yury Kazakov, Sergei Dovlatov (her secretary for many years), Viktor Konetzky, Andrei Bitov, and Viktor Golyavkin. Her son Boris Vakhtin (1930‚Äì1981) was a notable dissident and Russian writer, the founder of the group Gorozhane. In 1967 she suffered a stroke that left her partially paralyzed. Though incapacitated, she continued to work with the help of her family and a number of secretaries until the day of her death. Vera Panova died in Leningrad in 1973 and is buried in Komarovo near Anna Akhmatova.

It reflected the aims of the Institute but was editorially independent, with the editor for the first five issues being Dan Cruickshank, followed by Giles Worsley. The first Premier issue was launched on 15 March 1994 with a cover date of April 1994 and a print run of 75,000Jonathan Glancey, Prince finds the common ground on architecture, The Independent, 16 March 1994, page 17 although later that year sales were well below the breakeven target of 35,000 a month.Sandra Barwick, Cracks in the harmony thingy, The Independent, 13 August 1994 The magazine was published jointly by Peter Murray's Wordsearch Ltd and Perfect Harmony Ltd, the later being a company bought and established in 1993 as the publishing arm of the Institute of Architecture. The magazine was issued monthly (excluding December) until March 1996, when it became bi-monthly, starting with the April/May issue. It ceased publication in 1998 after four years and 33 issues, with its February/March issue being the last. In his first editorial, Cruickshank wrote that 'Perspectives is concerned with the care and conservation of the best aspects of our built history and the countryside, and with the protection of the landscape, but it is also committed to the evolution of a new architecture which combines temporary technology with the inspirational ideas offered by traditional buildings ... The reconciliation of the old and the new, united with a concern for relating new buildings to their settings, will restore delight to our view of the world. Perspectives will campaign for beauty and inspiration and a recovery of that spiritual sense of the numinous that only great architecture or great works of art can offer.'The Sesquipedalist on Perspectives, 27 January 2009; also in the Architects' Journal, 27 November 2008.

Club career PAS Giannina He played in PAS Giannina for three seasons (2001‚Äì2004) playing as a striker. He made his first 7 appearances with the club in the 2001/02 season as a rising star, helping the club to be promoted in the Greek Super League. But the next year 2002/03 did not be among the first priorities of the coach, the club is relegated and started to play the year after (2003/04 season) when the club is playing in Football League making 24 appearances. During these 3 periods he scored only two goals but he made 17 assists, being the first for his club. AEK Athens After his move to AEK Athens head coach Fernando Santos wanted to make him a right back. As a result, in one of his latest interviews, he stated that his natural position is that of the right back. In his first season in AEK Athens, he was an indispensable member of the club (as well in Greece under 21), contributing with many assists. He managed to being among the first priorities of Santos having 15 appearances in the League, 6 in the Greek Cup and two in UEFA Europa League. An injury in 2005, deprived him from playing in the starting XI, hence in season 2005/2006 having just 2 appearances (in the Greek Cup). Kerkyra In 2006‚Äì2007, Lloren√ß Serra Ferrer having two other Right Defenders (Nikolaos Georgeas and Martin Albano Pautasso) proposed him a loan move, at first, to Niki Volou (a Second Division team). However, Bourbos refused. But just a few hours before the transfer window deadline Kerkyra made an offer for Bourbos' loan, including his annual wage, managing to loan him for the rest of the season. He returned to AEK at the end of the season as he was not in the plans of Kerkyra's coach Babis Tennes. Iraklis On 27 June 2008, Bourbos signed with Iraklis on a two- year contract for an undisclosed fee. A day before his deal with the club Bourbos stated in Sports Metropolis: \\" I feel bitterness leaving AEK. I talked with the president Antonis Remos but mostly Ilias Poursanidis. I will sign for two years. Iraklis wants to make a strong team. I did not play often with AEK and I expects to play with my new club. This is a reason why I decided to join the club, besides the fact that I will continue playing in the highest level (i.e. Super League).\\" His career is declining and during 1,5-year in Iraklis did not succeed to make the difference. He made his debut with the club in a 2‚Äì1 home loss against Panserraikos. Eventually he left the club due to financial problems. On April 2011, after his departure from the club, newspapers claimed that the club still owes him ‚Ç¨35,580. The player expected to take legal action. This means that if the club continues to prove inconsistent with the player could face a deduction of points. Already spokesman footballer Lakis Simeoforidis an ex-player and advocate, has informed EPO and Super League, in order to start all the necessary procedures and informing the Board of License Commission. OFI Crete  OFI did not actually being among his first priorities, but the club gave him the opportunity to celebrate another promotion to the Greek Super League and put him in the football 'map' again. On 26 September 2010, he made his debut with the club in a 0‚Äì0 home draw against Kallithea. On January 2012, he scored the only goal with the club in a 3‚Äì1 away win against Panetolikos for the Greek Cup. He made 99 appearances in all competitions with the club scoring one goal. It seemed for long time that something's up with Bourbos and finally suspicions, took flesh and bones. Christos Bourbos filed an appeal to safeguard his salaries, which exceed ‚Ç¨320,000! The player who has a contract with OFI Crete, tried to come to an agreement with the president of the club Manthos Poulinakis, but this never happened. The 30-year-old right-back, took the decision to make the appeal as \\"I got tired of waiting and fooling him. The debts have to do with my presence in the club in the last three years, and each time, I did not take the money provided in my contract.\\" the player said. In the 2013/14 season Bourbos was one of the best players of the club. The blow is economical for OFI Crete and if the player is left free, the club loses a key member. The appeal of Bourbos added to that of Ricardo Ver√≥n, for a similar reason is clearly a big thorn for the club. Panathinaikos On 7 July 2014 Bourbos has signed a two years' contract with Panathinaikos. On 30 November 2015, according to newspapers' rumours Christos Bourbos is expected to leave Panathinaikos in January transfer window, because they are not in the plans of manager Andrea Stramaccioni, as he played only one match in 2015-16 season. The right defender is a transfer target of Veria. On 10 January 2016, Bourbos is finally expected to leave Panathinaikos within the month with a small compensation for his contract termination. On 3 February 2016,Panathinaikos terminated Bourbos's contract by immediate effect. The Greek right-back was not among Andrea Stramaccioni's plans and both sides took the decision to terminate his contract. Aris On 18 July 2016, Aris officially announced the signing of experienced right defender, who was recently released from Panathinaikos, until the summer of 2018.

Club career  Greece (AEL, Proodeftiki, AEK Athens)  Moras started his career at the Greek club AEL and moved to Proodeftiki at the age of 20. After one season at Proodeftiki, the club won promotion to the Greek Super League for the 2002‚Äì03 season. After having impressed in his first season in the Greek first division, Moras moved to Greek giants AEK Athens at the age of 22. He made 84 appearances in his career at AEK in all competitions. He got released by the club on 22 May 2007.  Bologna  On 1 July 2007, Moras signed for the Italian club Bologna. After his first season there, he helped the club to win promotion to the Serie A. Moras scored his first goal for Bologna against S.S.C. Napoli scoring the winning goal. He made 104 appearances in his career at Bologna in all competitions.  Swansea City  On 14 October 2011, it was confirmed that the player had joined Premier League team Swansea City. Brendan Rodgers‚Äô defensive headache has eased slightly with FIFA finally giving Swansea City the green light to sign Vangelis Moras on a three-month deal. The Greek defender, a free agent having left Bologna in the summer, agreed terms with Swansea after a successful trial in South Wales, scoring a goal in a friendly against Llanelli on 7 October 2011, but delays in processing the paperwork looked set to leave Rodgers with only one fully fit centre-half for Saturday's trip to Norwich. He made his Premier League debut in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Wolves on 22 October 2011. He left the club after his three-month loan deal expired in January 2012.  Cesena Cesena officially signed Moras a free agent after his short-term contract with Swansea expired and has signed a new deal until the end of the season. The Sea Horses announced that Moras will undergo his medical on Thursday before taking on his first training session. In his interview, the defender who was under contract until June, was ready to take the field against Novara: \\"I am happy for my arrival even with a two-years' delay, as last season we were very close. With Swansea I did not go well (only 7 games with 6 of them with the reserve-team), so I desperately want to go back to Italy and I thanks Cesena for this opportunity.\\" Furthermore, he said that \\"the situation is difficult but we can save, I'm used to fighting. I know the coach, it was he who took me to Italy, in Bologna, where I stayed four seasons, the best time of my career so far. I am a close friend of Antonioli together we were rossobl√π: it was old then, it's old now, nothing has changed.\\" On 21 January 2012, he made his debut with Cesena in a 5‚Äì1 loss with Roma. Besides the fact that he is regular starter till the end of the 2011/12 season, he left the club after his six- month deal expired in June 2012.  Hellas Verona On 1 July 2012, Moras signed for the Italian club Hellas Verona. After his first season there, he helped the club to win promotion to the Serie A. In June 2013, Panathinaikos is chasing the signature of the Greek international, as the club looks to begin rebuilding after a disappointing season. The Athenian giants missed out on European football for the first time in almost two decades last season and the club is expected to change its approach to the transfer market drastically this summer. A key part of that approach will be focusing on bringing in Greek players and staff, whilst avoiding the exorbitant wages it has previously paid for underperforming foreign players. Moras, who was a key part of Hellas Verona's promotion to Serie A last season, has reportedly been in contact with the club. Panathinaikos did not easily give up, offering him a two-year contract worth around ‚Ç¨200-250,000 a year. Eventually, the upcoming deal with Panathinaikos did not come to an end and the Greek defender signed with the club for another year. Moras scored his first goal for Verona against Varese scoring the winning goal. In a game against Bologna, Moras did not react to a biff from Jonatan Cristaldo during the Serie A match between his club and Bologna FC at Stadio Marc'Antonio Bentegodi on March 2, 2014 in Verona, showing his character and moral. Additionally, on 9 April 2014, in an interview had made clear that Hellas Verona are not thinking about Europe, but only finishing out the season well. The club has been one of the surprise packages of the season and until recently were in direct competition for a spot in the Europa League. However, on from a recent fall in form, their Greek international centre-back has made clear where focus truly lies. \\"Europe? I don‚Äôt even want to hear that word,\\" he told reporters at a trade event this week. \\"We are thinking about every Sunday's game, we will see at the end where we will be. I am not thinking about Europe, it is the only thing that can make me feel bad. Now we hope to close the season out very well, because it is good for the club and for the fans. This was a very difficult season, we were able to achieve safety in March and this was an important thing. It was not easy to reach this target and teams with more experienced players were not able to do it, and we have. Now let's enjoy this moment, we have been through some difficulties and we now think to finish well.\\" Vangelis Moras will be part of the 23 players of Greece that will fly in Brazil. A great season with Hellas Verona's performance level that has not gone unnoticed by Fernando Santos, coach of Greece, who decided to bet big on him. But the first to believe in the quality of Vangelis Moras of Bologna was Fabrizio Salvatori, who took him in red and blue, \\" ...was released, and really wanted to come to Italy ‚Äì says Salvatori exclusive to GianlucaDiMarzio.com ‚Äì He accepted a year contract with an option for three more years if he had done well, and so it was with Bologna in Serie B came by a couple of goals in that year, and contributing significantly to the promotion. He steadily grows in confidence, which led him to play in the World Cup. He is a versatile player who improves every year. But even before this is a great guy who deserves this call, after he has done very well this year in Verona.\\" On 8 July 2014 Hellas Verona have renewed Greek international Moras‚Äô contract until June 2015. The defender put pen to paper on a new deal, which includes an option to add another year till June 2016. On 21 April 2015 Vangelis Moras reached 100 appearances with the jersey of Hellas Verona and Greek international defender celebrated, by holding a Greek flag on Instagram. On 17 May 2015, Vangelis Moras in an interview, has expressed his concern regarding the future of the club in the midst of rumors suggesting that the club might be sold. Speaking after his side's 2‚Äì1 win over Empoli, the Greek centre-back also demanded more clarity from owner Maurizio Setti despite the Italian businessman having recently stated that the club will not be sold in the summer. \\"The president has denied the sale of the club, but I want more certainty,\\" said the 33-year-old to Sky Sport Italia.\\"And I hope all things are sorted and we‚Äôll be ready to start again properly from next season.\\" This situation is being much talked about because there are a number of Gialloblu players whose contract expire in the summer of 2015, including that of Moras. On 18 September 2015, Moras stated that he wants to finish his career with Hellas Verona \\" Ours is not a job like any other, in a football team we are mates, the fans and the company. I am at Verona for four years and for me it's like a second family. All helped me to deal with this difficult problem, all were close to me and I can only say thank you to the men with whom I have a relationship important and special. I feel part of this team and I want to close my career here. Toughest opponents? No doubt those lower down in the standings, one must not underestimate them because they might put you in more trouble than large. \\" said to calcionews. On 29 November 2015, he scored his first goal for the 2015‚Äì16 season in a 2‚Äì3 away loss against Frosinone with his header from a corner somehow squirming through Nicola Leali's hands in a goalkeeping howler.

On 30 March 2019, he scored his first goal with the club with a powerful header from Stefan ≈Ωivkoviƒá‚Äôs corner sealing a 2‚Äì1 home win game against rivals Asteras Tripolis in his club effort to avoid relegation. Apollon Larissa F.C. On 9 September 2020, Moras signed with Super League 2 club Apollon Larissa F.C. a year contract for an undisclosed fee. International career Moras competed for Greece at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Following some impressive performances for his club in the Serie A, Moras was called up to play for Greece on 11 February 2009 in a friendly against Denmark, where he made his international debut. Greece manager Otto Rehhagel announced the ten men who will make up part of the squad to will take on the Danes in Piraeus, with the remainder of locally based players to be called up as the match approaches.

I am grateful to the people who have shown faith in me. On my part, I am prepared to do everything to please my manager and to maintain my position in the national team for a long time.\\" Moras said. Moras exceptional season year with Hellas Verona was his passport not only to be called by Santos to the 30 man provisional World Cup squad, but also to the final 23-man squad for 2014 FIFA World Cup. Personal life In July 2014, Moras travelled to Australia to donate bone marrow to his brother Dimitris, who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia while on holiday in the country and was being treated in a Melbourne hospital.

He previously played at senior level in Iceland and Sweden, and was also a youth player in the Netherlands. Club career Ari started his career at Valur. At sixteen, he went to SC Heerenveen in the Netherlands where he spent two seasons. He was released at the end of 2005 when he could not make the first team. He returned to Valur where he played half a season before signing with Allsvenskan club BK H√§cken. Although relegated to the Swedish second tier, the club competed in the UEFA Cup qualifiers the following year because of their fair play ranking. H√§cken managed to progress into the main competition after Ari scored the winning goal against Scottish club Dunfermline Athletic F.C.. H√§cken failed to gain promotion, and he signed with Allsvenskan club GIF Sundsvall at the end of the year. At the start of the 2012 season he became captain of the club. On 11 July 2013 it was revealed that Ari had signed a contract with Danish Superliga club OB for the start of 2014 when his contract with Sundsvall expired. On 19 July it was announced that the clubs had reached an agreement for his semi- immediate transfer. On 27 July he played his last game for Sundsvall, scoring two free-kick goals in a 3‚Äì3 draw against GAIS. On 18 July 2016, Ari officially joined Belgian-side K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen. International career After being capped at various youth levels he got to make his debut for the Icelandic national team in 2009 against Iran. In 2012, he started getting more frequent callups from new national team manager Lars Lagerb√§ck. Despite Ari having been playing as a midfielder for his club side he was nonetheless picked in the Iceland squad as a left-back and has been the first- choice left-back in the national team during most of the 2014 World Cup qualifiers. Consequently, Ari felt that he needed to change his position at club level and asked to be bought as a left-back when he was sold in July 2013, so he could play that position at club level to be able to hold his place as the first-choice left-back in the Iceland squad, despite the fact that he has been praised as a central playmaker of high quality. He was selected for EURO 2016. He started in all of Iceland's five matches, helping the national team go to the quarter-finals in their very first European championship. In May 2018 he was named in Iceland‚Äôs 23 man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.https://www.goal.com/en/amp/news/world-cup-squad- injured-gylfi-sigurdsson/17guw991qjit61qqhhfn9lyhon Playing position Even though his most common position is in central midfield he can also play as a winger and has been playing as a fullback with the Iceland national football team. After transferring from Sweden to Denmark in 2013 he stated in an interview that he'd asked to be bought as a left-back to cement his place as the starting left-back in the national team. He will consequently be playing as a left-back in Denmark.

He is known for his work on Paleozoic crinoids, bryozoans, and corals. Moore was a member of US Geological Survey from 1913 until 1949. In 1919 he became professor at the University of Kansas (Lawrence). In 1953 Professor Moore organized the launch and became the first editor of the still ongoing multi-volume work Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology. Contributors to the Treatise have included the world's specialists in the field. He served as president of the Geological Society of America in 1958.Eckel, Edwin, 1982, GSA Memoir 155, The Geological Society of America ‚Äî Life History of a Learned Society: Boulder, Colorado, Geological Society of America Memoir 155, 168 p., . In 1970 he was awarded the Mary Clark Thompson Medal from the National Academy of Sciences.  Early life  Moore was raised in Kansas, Missouri, Wisconsin and Illinois. After attending high school in Milwaukee and Chicago, he enrolled in Denison University, taking his A.B. degree. He took his PhD at the University of Chicago in 1916, under the supervision of Stuart Weller. His dissertation was the stratigraphy of the Mississippian System of Missouri.  Early career  Moore commenced work as an Assistant Professor in geology at the University of Kansas in 1916. He became state geologist and director of the Geological Survey of Kansas. He married Georgine Watters in Chicago in 1917. In 1920, he was promoted to full Professor. He would alternate in his role of state geologist/director of the Geological Survey for 38 years, performing double duty as Professor for 23 of those years. After commencing work in Kansas he made the decision to analyse Permian-Pennsylvanian stratigraphy of the Midcontinent. He studied sedimentary units from Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri, as far as Oklahoma. He specialised on genetic stratigraphy, which would become cyclic sedimentation and sequence stratigraphy in modern study. Moore and his wife Georgine divorced in 1935. Their daughter Marjorie Ann Moore had been born in 1928. Moore married Lilian Boggs in St Louis, Missouri in 1936. In addition to his stratigraphic work, Moore was able to define and clarify his findings by identifying their unique fossil signatures. He studied oil and gas resources up to the Precambrian period, as well as igneous intrusives in several counties within Kansas. His maps of the state are still distributed by the Kansas Geological Survey today. Moore also developed a uniform stratigraphic code for the Midcontinent. He expanded into the area of facies. He used ecological communities (ecosystems) to help understand cyclothems. As his work developed a stratigraphic and sedimentological framework, he turned his attention to invertebrate paleontology, working on corals, crinoids, gastropods and bryozoans. After serving in the Army during World War II, Moore moved on to teach advanced courses such as ‚ÄúField Stratigraphy‚Äù and ‚ÄúGeologic Development of the World‚Äù in the late 1940s.  Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology  Following his war service, Moore began work on a project which was pitched to the University of Kansas, Kansas Geological Survey and the National Science Foundation, which would become the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology. With planning beginning in 1953, Moore drafted a project where specialists would write on their area of expertise in paleontology to a multi volume series. This international team of experts would provide the manuscripts, which would be published by the University of Kansas Press. Moore became the editor, and also supervised the dedications, introductions, definition of morphologic terms, as well as other explanations. He supplied the parts to the Treatise which concerned his own specialty areas. In the introduction to Part A of ‚ÄúFossilization‚Äù (1979) a dedication to Moore as the founder of the Treatise was published. It also features a pen-and-ink sketch of him by his former student Roger Williams. As volumes of the Treatise were completed up until 1966 these were published by the Geological Society of America and the University of Kansas Press. After 1966, new volumes of the ongoing work were published by the Geological Society of America and the University of Kansas. The Treatise continues to this day, and new volumes are published online. The Paleontological Institute of the University of Kansas became the sole publisher of the series in 2009.  Later career  In 1958, Moore was appointed as a Solen E. Summerfield Distinguished Professor. This distinguished him as one of the leading professors of the university. He would go on to supervise many student theses and dissertations, a large number of them studying Kansas subjects. Many of these students went on to teach at major universities or distinguish themselves within their respective industries. Fluent in a number of languages, Moore was able to make use of international literature and expected his students to be similarly conversant with non-English literature.

Though it is called Satkhanda, it has only four stories, as the construction of the tower was abandoned when Ali Shah died. Satkhanda was built between 1837‚Äì1842 in the time of Muhammad Ali Shah. He wanted to make it the same as Qutub Minar of Delhi and the leaning tower of Pisa. Its main purpose is lunar observation.  Improper restoration  The building has been renovated; however, the process has been criticized. In 2016 The Economist wrote that \\"[this building] was recently ‚Äúrepaired‚Äù with modern cement, wrecking its subtle plasterwork\\".

Released in 1991, it was the first-ever release from Osmose Productions, an independent French metal label. Worship Him is considered a milestone in the development of second wave black metal. Background and recording Released on April 1, 1991, Worship Him was the first full-length album released by the newly formed Osmose Productions.Patterson (2013), page 80. Vorphalack, Samael's guitarist and singer, described the experience of recording the album with Claude Lander: Musical style and influences Samael's initial influences were Slayer, Bathory, Venom and early Possessed, plus NWOBHM acts Mot√∂rhead and Iron Maiden. Hellhammer were also hugely inspirational.Patterson (2013), page 77. Vorphalack claims that when he heard Apocalyptic Raids he thought: Legacy Terrorizer magazine's first \\"Black Metal Special\\" issue recognized Samael as one of the early second wave of black metal bands that were \\"highly respected, influential and, most importantly, had their own unique sound.\\"Strachan (2005), pages 37. Worship Him had a significant impact on the early Norwegian black metal scene. Euronymous of Mayhem was a big supporter of the band. Although he never offered Samael a deal with Deathlike Silence Productions label, Euronymous regretted not releasing Worship Him, which he deemed an outstanding record. Another key figure in the early Norwegian black metal scene, Fenriz of Darkthrone fame, deemed Worship Him as a classic black metal album. The musician included the song \\"Into the Pentagram\\" as part of his own The Best of Old-School Black Metal compilation. Fenriz stated in the CD booklet the said song is \\"Samael's answer to Hellhammer's 'Triumph of Death'\\".Fenriz (2004), page 7. Of Samael's early sound, he said the following: Decibel magazine inducted Worship Him to their \\"Hall of Fame\\" on their #118 issue.

She displaced 1,950 tons and had a speed of . I-21 was the most successful Japanese submarine to operate in Australian waters, participating in the attack on Sydney Harbour in 1942 and sinking 44,000 tons of Allied shipping during her two deployments off the east coast of Australia. Service history The submarine was laid down on 7 January 1939 at the Kawasaki shipyard, Kobe, and launched on 24 February 1940. On 15 July 1941 she was completed, commissioned and assigned to Submarine Squadron 1's Submarine Division 3 in the Sixth Fleet. I-21 was based in the Yokosuka Naval District. On 31 October 1941 Commander Matsumura Kanji was assigned as Commanding Officer, and on 10 November he attended a meeting of submarine commanders aboard the light cruiser , convened by Vice Admiral Mitsumi Shimizu, to be briefed on the planned attack on Pearl Harbor. Attack on Pearl Harbor I-21 departed Yokosuka on 19 November and sailed to the rendezvous at Hitokappu Bay, Etorofu, arriving on the 22nd, and departing on the 26th for the Hawaiian Islands, acting as a lookout ahead of the Carrier Striking Force. On 2 December 1941 the coded signal \\"Climb Mount Niitaka\\" was received, signifying that hostilities would commence on 8 December (Japan time). On 7 December 1941 I-21 was assigned to patrol north of Oahu, Hawaii. On 9 December I-6 reported sighting a and two cruisers. I-21 and the rest of SubRon 1 boats, were ordered to pursue and sink her. However I-21s pursuit was delayed by diesel engine breakdowns and electrical problems. She was also spotted by several Douglas SBD Dauntless dive-bombers and forced to dive each time. Finally, on 14 December, the chase was abandoned and I-21 and the other submarines were ordered to the West Coast of the United States to attack American shipping. I-21 was assigned to patrol off Point Arguello, California. Sinking of SS Montebello On 23 December 1941, I-21 sighted the Union Oil Company's oil tanker . The vessel, built in 1921, was en route from Port San Luis, California, to Vancouver, British Columbia. At 05:30, I-21 fired two torpedoes at a range of . One was a dud, but the other struck forward in the pump room and dry storage cargo hold. The 38-man crew abandoned the tanker in four lifeboats, which were machine-gunned by I-21 with no casualties. Montebello sank in of water about south of Piedras Blancas Light at . In November 1996, a team of marine researchers surveyed and filmed the wreck in a two-person submarine. Montebello, apparently still loaded with of crude oil, was discovered to be resting on the sea floor in of water adjacent to the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The wreck was reexamined in 2010 for the level of deterioration and to determine if the oil was still in the hold and if so, did it pose an environmental threat. The researchers reported in October 2011 that the cargo had dissipated into the vast ocean shortly after sinking. Shelling of Newcastle, Australia On 8 June 1942, I-21 briefly shelled Newcastle, New South Wales. Among the areas hit within the city were dockyards and steel works. There were no casualties in the attack and damage was minimal. Possible sinking of USS Porter On 26 October 1942, in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, I-21 is credited in most sources with sinking of the destroyer . However, author Richard B. Frank states that Japanese records do not support this, and that, more likely, an errant torpedo from a ditching U.S. Grumman TBF Avenger hit Porter and caused the fatal damage. Sinking of SS Kalingo On 17 January 1943, I-21 torpedoed and sank the Union Steam Ship Company's SS Kalingo about east of Sydney. Two firemen were killed when the torpedo hit, and 32 of her crew reached safety in a boat. Sinking of SS Iron Knight The BHP Shipping iron ore carrier was part of a convoy of ten ships travelling up the east coast of New South Wales on 8 February 1943. At approximately 2:30 am, north of Twofold Bay, I-21 fired a torpedo at the naval ships flanking Iron Knight at the head of the flotilla under cover of darkness. The torpedo passed under the bow of the and struck Iron Knight, sinking her with the loss of 36 crewmen, including her commander, in less than two minutes. Most of the ship's crew were below decks and were unable to escape as the ship went down. Only 14 survived, clambering aboard a single lifeboat to be picked up by the . , the other corvette guarding the convoy, pursued the I-21 for several days. On 4 June 2006, the wreck of Iron Knight was discovered in waters off the New South Wales town of Bermagui at a depth of approximately . Local fishermen had snagged their nets on the wreck over the years. Families and descendants of the crew traveled to the site and laid a wreath and poppies on the waters above the wreck. The sole remaining survivor of the sinking, John Stone, was unable to make the journey from his home in southern Victoria. Sinking of Starr King Port Macquarie on 10 February 1943. On 11 February 1943, I-21 sank the 7,176 GRT U.S. Liberty Ship Starr King near Port Macquarie. There were no casualties, and the crew was picked up by . Other ships damaged or sunk along the Australian east coast On 18 January 1943, I-21 torpedoed the tanker Mobilube, off the coast of Sydney, with the loss of three lives. On 22 January 1943 I-21 also torpedoed the Liberty ship Peter H. Burnett, approximately north of Sydney, it was towed back to Sydney by the corvette HMAS Mildura. On 12 November 1943 the troopship \\"Cape San Juan\\" was torpedoed and sank the next day.SS \\"Cape San Juan\\" Loss I-21 was never sighted again following a final report made on 27 November 1943, off the Gilbert Islands. A Japanese Type B submarine, which was probably I-21, was torpedoed and sunk by TBF Avengers off Tarawa on 29 November 1943.

It was also released as the B-side to the \\"Let It Bleed\\" single in Japan. Recorded on 18 February 1969, \\"You Got the Silver\\" is the first Stones song to feature guitarist Keith Richards on solo lead vocal throughout (Richards previously sang separate lead vocals on parts of \\"Something Happened to Me Yesterday\\" from Between the Buttons and \\"Salt of the Earth\\" from Beggars Banquet). One of Richards' own compositions, \\"You Got the Silver\\" is said to have been written about his then-girlfriend Anita Pallenberg. \\"You Got the Silver\\" was the last Stones recording with Brian Jones to be released. He plays autoharp, one of his two appearances on the album. The band recorded a version of the song with Mick Jagger on lead, but opted to use Richards' version for the official release. The Jagger version has since become a well-known bootleg recording. Jones' autoharp contribution can only be heard clearly on the alternate mix with Jagger on vocals and it is played only during the section of the verses where the drums join in. Bill Wyman's bass playing also stands out more in the unreleased alternate mix. The official/album mix has the autoharp mixed very low though it can be heard in the right-hand channel between 1:04 and 1:25. The bootleg mix with Jagger on vocals places Jones's autoharp much more prominently in the mix. Nicky Hopkins' overdubbed organ and piano to the track and a backwards echo effect is applied to Richards' slide guitar track. The story that the Jagger vocal was accidentally erased has been repeated by many since 1969, including engineer Glyn Johns in his book Sound Man. The legend is that Richards recorded the vocal because Jagger was in Australia filming Ned Kelly. However, the high quality bootleg recordings of the Jagger vocal indicate that the Richards vocal was a deliberate choice. Jagger finished filming Ned Kelly in September. Final work on Let It Bleed continued into October and Jagger could have re-recorded the lost vocal at that time. The song was played live for the first time during the No Security Tour in 1999. It was brought out again by Richards for the 2005-2007 A Bigger Bang Tour. A November 1, 2006 live performance captured on the 2008 concert film Shine a Light is featured on the album of the same name. The song was also played during the Rolling Stones' 50 and Counting tour, and a July 2013 performance appears on Hyde Park Live, featuring Ronnie Wood playing slide guitar. During live performances, the song is notable for being sung by Richards without playing guitar or any other instrument. \\"You Got the Silver\\" was featured in the Michelangelo Antonioni film Zabriskie Point.
