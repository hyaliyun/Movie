The hardcover edition was released November 16, 2010. Other editions were released on earlier dates. Plot As are most Dirk Pitt novels, the story begins with one or more historical prologues: an attack on a Roman galley in 327 AD, and an episode in 1916 in which a British warship mysteriously explodes and sinks in the North Sea. In the present, important mosques in Egypt and Turkey are damaged by planted explosives. While doing underwater explorations off Turkey and on the Israeli coasts, Dirk Pitt and Dirk Pitt, Jr., face villainous characters who cause them both to become involved in uncovering a plot to resurrect the Ottoman Empire. Summer Pitt, the elder Pitt's daughter, stumbles upon a manifest in England that dates to the time of Jesus and sheds new light on early Christianity. The Pitts and NUMA, for whom they work, become involved in action-packed episodes throughout the book.

(2009), Systematic Classification of Recent and Fossil Conoidean Gastropods, ConchBooks, Hankenheim, Germany, 295 pp. * Genus Conus sensu stricto Linnaeus, 1758 :: Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The basic shell shape is conical to elongated conical, has a deep anal notch on the shoulder, a smooth periostracum and a small operculum. The shoulder of the shell is usually nodulose and the protoconch is usually multispiral. Markings often include the presence of tents except for black or white color variants, with the absence of spiral lines of minute tents and textile bars. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radula has an elongated anterior section with serrations and a large exposed terminating cusp, a non-obvious waist, blade is either small or absent and has a short barb, and lacks a basal spur. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the Indo-Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species eat other gastropods including cones. * Subgenus Globiconus Tucker & Tenorio, 2009 ::Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The shell is cylindrical in shape. The protoconch is multispiral with 2.5 whorls. The anal notch is moderate to deep, and the anterior notch is absent. The whorl tops are smooth, and the early whorls are not nodulose but may be ornamented by an undulating carina. The body whorl is ornamented with grooves or sulci reaching the shoulder. The periostracum is smooth, and the operculum has not been observed. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radular morphology of Globiconus is unique. The anterior sections of the radular tooth is roughly equal to the length of the posterior section, and the blade is short. A posterior fold is present and modified into a tube, and the posterior blade is absent. A basal spur is present, and the barb is short. A shaft fold is present and is blunt at its anterior end and not pronounced. ::Geographical distribution :::The only living species in this genus is occurs in the Eastern Pacific region. Fossil species in this genus have been found in the Eastern Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::The only living species in this genus is vermivorous (meaning that these snails prey on marine worms). Species list This list of species is based on the information in the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) list. Species within the genus Globiconus include: * Globiconus baccatus (G. B. Sowerby III, 1877) represented as Conus baccatus G. B. Sowerby III, 1877 (alternate representation) * Globiconus tornatus (G.B. Sowerby I, 1833) is equivalent to Conus tornatus G. B. Sowerby I, 1833 (alternate representation) Significance of \\"alternative representation\\" Prior to 2009, all cone species were placed within the family Conidae and were placed in one genus, Conus. In 2009 however, J.K. Tucker and M.J. Tenorio proposed a classification system for the over 600 recognized species that were in the family. Their classification proposed 3 distinct families and 82 genera for the living species of cone snails, including the family Conilithidae. This classification was based upon shell morphology, radular differences, anatomy, physiology, cladistics, with comparisons to molecular (DNA) studies. Published accounts of genera within the Conidae (or Conilithidae) that include the genus Globiconus include J.K. Tucker & M.J. Tenorio (2009), and Bouchet et al. (2011).Bouchet P., Kantor Yu.I., Sysoev A. & Puillandre N. (2011). \\"A new operational classification of the Conoidea\\". Journal of Molluscan Studies 77: 273-308. Testing in order to try to understand the molecular phylogeny of the Conidae was initially begun by Christopher Meyer and Alan Kohn,Interview of Professor Alan Kohn, Professor Emeritus, Zoology and is continuing, particularly with the advent of nuclear DNA testing in addition to mDNA testing. However, in 2011, some experts still use the traditional classification, where all species are placed in Conus within the single family Conidae: for example, according to the current November 2011 version of the World Register of Marine Species, all species within the family Conidae are in the genus Conus. The binomial names of species in the 82 cone snail genera listed in Tucker & Tenorio 2009 are recognized by the World Register of Marine Species as \\"alternative representations.\\" http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=14107 Classification: Traditionally, all cone shells have been included in the Linnaean genus Conus. Tucker & Tenorio (2009) have recently proposed an alternative shell- and radula-based classification that recognizes 4 families and 80 genera of cones. In WoRMS, we currently still recognize a single family Conidae (following Puillandre et al. 2011), but Tucker & Tenorio's 80 genera classification is presented as \\"alternative representation\\".

Most of the range is in Shan State, with its northern limit close to the border with China, and runs southwards across the Thai border, at the northern end of Thailand. Geologically in the Daen Lao Range, as in the other southern subranges of the Shan Hills, layers of alluvium are superimposed on hard rock.Geology of Thailand - Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Bangkok Geography The range extends east of the Salween until almost reaching the Golden Triangle area, separating the Salween watershed from the Mekong watershed. At its southern end the Thanon Thong Chai Range (‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏ñ‡∏ô‡∏ô‡∏ò‡∏á‡∏ä‡∏±‡∏¢) subrange stretches further southwards into Thailand between the Sai River in the east and the Pai River in the west; the latter separating the Daen Lao from the Thanon Thong Chai Range.Geography of Thailand Some geographers include the Thanon Thong Chai Range subrange as part of the Daen Lao Range.The Physical Geography of Southeast Asia, Avijit Gupta, Oxford University Press, 2005. The Khun Tan Range also extends southwards from the Daen Lao Range, parallel to the Thanon Thong Chai mountains, but it differs geologically and structurally from the latter. The western end of the range is not clearly defined. Elevations range between 400‚Äì2,500 m. The highest point is 2,563 m Loi Pangnao in Burma, with a prominence of 1,596 m, one of the ultra prominent peaks of Southeast Asia. On the Thai side the highest point is 2,285 m Doi Pha Hom Pok. Doi Chiang Dao (2,175 m), Doi Puk Phakka (1,794 m), Doi Nang Non, a karstic formation in Chiang Rai Province, Doi Tung, Doi Ang Khang and Doi Wao, where Wat Doi Wao is located, as well as the mountains surrounding the village of Santikhiri (Doi Mae Salong) are also part of this range.Tourism Chiang Rai History Historically the area has been sparsely populated. Only some hill tribes such as the Wa, Akha, Yao, Lahu, and the Lisu people lived in scattered small villages across the range. Many Shan people believe King Naresuan was cremated in the Daen Lao Range, in the southern part of Shan State, and his ashes interred in a stupa in Mongton.The Nation, Warrior king remains a very modern mystery , 30 Apr 2006 Until the 1990s one of the main crops at elevations above 1,000 m was opium. On the side of the range controlled by the Thai government, construction of roads reaching remote areas and increasingly efficient policing ensured a measure of success of the opium replacement programs in recent years.Opium Reduction and Highland Development: Thailand Case Study Owing to the unrest in Burma, the National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA) and other groups sought refuge and a base for their insurgency in these mountains. Fighting and the ensuing persecution by the TatmadawMongla base shelled by Burma Army artillery have caused part of the original population to flee. Some refugee camps have been established for cross-border refugees on the Thai side of the range. Some Kayah and Karen communities, like the \\"long-necked Karen\\", are regularly visited by organized tourist groups.The Politics of Ethnic Tourism in Northern Thailand The Ang Khang Royal Agricultural Station is in the mountains of the range. It was founded in 1969 by the King of Thailand and is notable for its temperate climate that allows the cultivation of flowers and fruits characteristic of cooler climates.Royal Agricultural Station Angkhang In March 2011 there was a magnitude 5 earthquake in the Burmese side of the range with the epicenter north of Chiang Rai town.

It has a closely arranged crown, with an erect stem and many branches. Both the branches and the leaves are covered in fine hairs. The leaves, which may be flat or crinkled, are large and broad with teeth around the edge. They can be long and wide. The leaves are coppery green with red splashes, giving them a mottled appearance. Separate male and female flowers appear on the same plant. The male flowers are in long spikes which hang downwards while the female flowers are in short spikes. The latter do not show up easily as they are often hidden among the leaves. The flower stalks are 10‚Äì20 cm long. Distribution A. wilkesiana is a tropical and subtropical plant which grows naturally in Vanuatu and occurs in the Pacific Islands. It prefers light well drained soil and is suited to a protected shady position. It can be damaged by both drought and frost. It needs a minimum temperature above . It is best suited to hardiness zones 10-12. Mealy bugs on Acalypha wilkesiana Cultivation In South Florida and tropical America, copperleaf is a popular outdoor plant that provides colour throughout the year. It is used in mixed hedges and shrub borders and as a specimen shrub. Elsewhere copperleaf is grown as an annual where its spectacular foliage replaces flowers from late summer until frost. Copperleaf is also grown indoors as a container plant. However, it must be maintained in a warm, humid, bright environment. Light The plant, often called \\"copperleaf,\\" does fine in partial shade or sun. It prefers a position sheltered from strong winds, and a fertile, organic soil. Indoor plants do well in medium light, but leaf colour develops best on plants kept in bright light. Moisture Outdoors, copperleaf does best in a rich, moist, but fast-draining soil. Indoor plants do better in a soilless potting mix, with the medium constantly moist, but not saturated. Daily misting is recommended for indoor plants with only spare watering in winter. Hardiness Copperleaf is suited to USDA Zones 10-11. Although growing best in USDA Zones 10-11, copperleaf seems to have established in Zone 9a in Central Florida. Indoor plants should be kept above . Copperleaf can also be grown as an annual. Propagation Propagation can be done by stem cuttings at any time of year, using bottom heat. Diseases The plant is susceptible to mealy bug infection, which can result in growth retardation and also cause high fungal contaminations in in vitro studies. To reduce the mealy bug‚Äôs infection, 90% ethanol can be directly applied to the infestations using paint brushes. Arun Nagarajan, Peter G Alderson, Udhaya Arivalagan, (2003).

BMC Complementary and alternative medicine, 1-7. evaluated crude extracts from six important medicinal plants, namely Phylantus discoideus, Ageratum conyzoides, Terminalia avicennioides, Bridella ferruginea, Acalypha wilkesiana and Ocimum gratissimum, to find activity against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA. Water and ethanolic extracts of these plants were obtained locally. MRSA strains isolated from patients were used. Both ethanolic and water extracts showed effects on MRSA. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of these plants ranged from 30.4-37.0 ¬µg/ml and 18.2-24.0 ¬µg/ml respectively. A high MBS value was found in two plants and the other four contained traceable amounts of anthraquinones. This study provided scientific support for the use of Acalypha wilkesiana, T. avicennioides, O. gratissimum and P. discoidens against MRSA based diseases. A. conyzoides and B. ferruginea were unresponsive against the MRSA strains. Features This remarkable plant has foliage that is more colourful than many flowers.

It was one of the first public libraries in the country to offer open access to its holdings. History Founding In the 1830s the idea of public libraries was widely accepted in Russian society. However, due to financial straits, the first one in Ryazan was opened only in 1858. The newspaper Ryazanskiye Gubernskiye Vedomostiwww.arspress.ru (Russian: –†—è–∑–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏–µ –≥—É–±–µ—Ä–Ω—Å–∫–∏–µ –≤–µ–¥–æ–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏, literally \\"The Ryazan Guberniya Record\\") printed lists of donors. Among the founders of the Ryazan Public Library were the Ryazan gymnasium trustee, Nikolay Ryumin, the First guild merchant and fabulist Alexander Antonov and other well-known people. The library was housed in the town center. The opening day collection consisted of 1,275 volumes and 4,300 periodicals. Use of the reading room was free, but subscription to the lending library cost 6 roubles per annum, 4 roubles per half-year and 1 rouble per month. Among its members were the later Nobel laureate Ivan Pavlov, the Russian anti-Normanist historian Dmitry Ilovaysky, the Russian writer Nikolay Zlatovratsky and other famous people. For some time, Mikhail Saltykov- Shchedrin, the great Russian novelist and philosopher, appointed in 1858 to the Vice Governor of Ryazan, was a member of the library board of trustees.Ryazan Region.

According to the decision of Ryazan City Council dated 31 March 1928, the library was named in honour of Maxim Gorky to mark the 60th anniversary of the writer's birth. After Ryazan Oblast had been created in 1937, the Gorky library changed its status to an oblast library. In addition to the services that the library had been providing, since that year it developed new services (interlibrary loan, bibliographic indices and others). Its facilities were located at 24 Lenin Street, Ryazan, Ryazan Oblast. Even though the Great Patriotic War started in 1941, the library continued to serve local people. Some of the staff were called up, while the others went to work in hospitals. In the meantime, the number of visitors was about 12,000 per year. Turn of the twenty-first century Since the 1990s, the ROUNB has taken part in different projects for library automation: * 1992: the e-catalogue for local history was launched * 1993: the ROUNB holdings e-catalogue was created * 1996: the first website of the library was launched * 1999: the Centre of Business and Law Information was founded, with free access to Consultant Plus, Garant and other useful resources.

The episode's teleplay was written by Andrew Kreisberg and Michael Grassi, and directed by Nick Gomez. The episode features a crossover appearance by the title character of the CW series The Flash (also developed and produced by Greg Berlanti and Kreisberg), marking the first episode of the series to feature a character from the Arrowverse, and the first character from a CW series to cross over to a CBS series before the show itself moved to the CW network. The episode loosely intersects with the events of The Flash season 2 episode \\"Versus Zoom\\". The episode reunites Melissa Benoist with her former Glee recurring co- star Grant Gustin, who portrays the Flash. The episode title was inspired by the World's Finest Comics series, in which Superman would team up with various other DC superheroes, including the Flash. Plot At the DEO, Siobhan Smythe is treated for her fall. The doctor cannot explain her new powers, but confirms she is still human. As she leaves, Siobhan overhears Leslie Willis a.k.a. Livewire being interrogated and starts seeing images of a banshee. The visions continue as she returns to CatCo, where Cat advises Kara about her relationship with James. Siobhan's hypersonic scream sends Kara flying out the window, but a dimensional breach opens and someone rushes out at a high speed and catches Kara, letting her down in a field. The speedster introduces himself as Barry Allen, a.k.a. the Flash, a superhero from a parallel Earth, after Kara reveals herself as Supergirl, and Barry later learns her extraterrestrial origin. At CatCo, Barry meets Winn and James and explains the multiverse and how he reached their universe when testing a tachyon device fastened to his suit. Fascinated by each other's origins, Kara and Barry quickly become friends, and Kara offers to help Barry find a way home. Winn also befriends Barry attributable to his own fascination with parallel universes, but James is overawed by Barry's abilities. Cat calls the four into her office and demands they research the new superhero, rejecting Barry's idea to call him the Flash. Siobhan's aunt Sinead tells her of a banshee's curse on their family. If wronged by others, Smythe women are possessed and develop a powerful wail that belongs to the spiritto combat the curse, one must kill whoever wronged them. Siobhan concludes she must remove Supergirl to get Kara, unaware they are the same person, and frees Livewire. Cat refuses to go into hiding, so Kara asks for Barry's help and they pinpoint Livewire's location. The Flash attacks Livewire with lightning, but this charges her powers. Supergirl tries to short out Livewire, but Siobhan, now calling herself Silver Banshee, screams and disorients her. The heroes retreat and Kara apologizes for going in without a plan. Barry recalls his similar experience with Roy Bivolo, advising her to practice patience. Barry develops ear buds to dampen Silver Banshee's scream based on those he used against Hartley Rathaway. Livewire and Silver Banshee kidnap Cat and demand the two heroes come to National City Park. Livewire wreaks havoc before Supergirl and Flash arrive. Supergirl frees Cat before engaging Silver Banshee; Flash tackles Livewire, but she knocks him out. Livewire attacks a passing helicopter, but Supergirl takes the blow to protect the people below. The crowd surrounds her, and firefighters blast Livewire with water, causing her to lose control and shock Silver Banshee, defeating both. National City hails Supergirl as a hero again. With Flash's help, the police develop a means of incarcerating metahuman criminals, imprisoning Livewire and Silver Banshee. Cat reveals to Kara that she knew Barry was the Flash all along. At the field, Barry determines the kinetic energy from their combined running speed, with the tachyon device active, should create a breach back to his Earth. The two bid farewell before Barry enters the portal. Kara confesses her feelings to James, but he unemotionally walks out. Kara sees all the citizens acting similarly, marching in synchronicity. Non is revealed to be behind these events, as Myriad takes effect. Development In November 2014, creator Greg Berlanti expressed interest in Supergirl existing in the Arrowverse, the same universe as his other series Arrow and The Flash, and in January 2015, The CW president Mark Pedowitz revealed that he was also open to a crossover between the series and networks (due to Berlanti executive producing all three and The CW being co- owned by CBS). However, CBS Entertainment chair Nina Tassler stated that month that \\"those two shows are on a different network. So I think we'll keep Supergirl to ourselves for a while.\\" In August 2015, Tassler revealed that while there were no plans at the time to do crossover storylines, the three series would have crossover promotions. In January 2016, during the Television Critics Association press tour, Pedowitz said that The CW was still interested in a crossover with Supergirl if the producers could find a way to do it, and Berlanti added that while no official conversations had taken place, internal ones had concerning how a crossover would work. He also noted that for a crossover to happen during Supergirl first season, it would have to be figured out \\"in the next month or so\\". Glenn Geller, Tassler's successor at CBS, then stated on the matter, \\"I have to be really careful what I say here. Watch and wait and see what happens.\\" On February 3, 2016, it was announced that Grant Gustin, who appears as Barry Allen / Flash on The Flash, would appear in the eighteenth episode of the first season, \\"Worlds Finest\\". While no plot details on the episodes were released at the time, Ross A. Lincoln of Deadline Hollywood noted that \\"the in-universe reason\\" for the crossover was due to Barry's ability to travel to various dimensions, thus implying that Supergirl exists on an alternate Earth to Arrow and The Flash in a multiverse. The earth that Supergirl inhabits is Earth-38 in the Arrowverse multiverse, and has been informally referred to as \\"Earth-CBS\\" by Marc Guggenheim, one of the creators of Arrow. \\"Worlds Finest\\" loosely intersects with the events of The Flash season 2 episode \\"Versus Zoom\\". Reception Ratings In the United States, the episode received a 1.7/6 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 1.7 percent of all households, and 6 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was watched by 7.17 million viewers. Within a week of its release, \\"Worlds Finest\\" had been watched by 9.63 million U.S. viewers. Critical response Grant Gustin received critical acclaim for his appearance as The Flash Cliff Wheatley of IGN gave the episode an 8.6/10, stating \\"After the grim 'n' gritty Batman v Superman, Supergirl's \\"Worlds Finest\\" offered a fun, upbeat palette cleanser and one of the series' strongest episodes to date. Instead of the usual \\"beatdown\\" introduction, Supergirl and the Flash went straight to being superfriends, which was refreshing. Not only did Barry Allen fit perfectly in Kara's world, but actors Grant Gustin and Melissa Benoist had fantastic chemistry together onscreen. While the city's turnaround on Supergirl's Red K incident was a little sudden, overall, \\"Worlds Finest\\" was delightful.\\"\\"SUPERGIRL: \\"Worlds Finest\\" REVIEW\\" from IGN (March 29, 2016) Caroline Siede of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, stating \\"My biggest fear going into ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Finest‚Äù was that the episode would be a fun one-off designed to convert Flash fans into Supergirl fans (and vice versa, I suppose) while ignoring the compelling narrative Supergirl has been exploring since Kara went bad in ‚ÄúFalling.‚Äù Instead ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Finest‚Äù relies heavily on Supergirl‚Äôs long-term storytelling, pulling together threads from the entire season into one jam-packed episode. And it does so while introducing the most enjoyable superhero team-up this side of The Avengers. For better or for worse, ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Finest‚Äù represents Supergirl in a nutshell: Fun, clunky, cheesy, and more intelligent than it seems at first glance.\\"\\"Supergirl and The Flash team-up for the dawn of inspiring superheroes \\" from The A.V.

It features Iis Sugianto, Sys NS, Chrisye, and Lydia Kandou in a story about a singer working to support her family. It spawned a soundtrack album. Plot A pop music singer (Iis Sugianto) must perform to help her family, including her ailing father. Meanwhile, her boyfriend (Sys NS) and another couple (Chrisye and Lydia Kandou) also sing. Production Seindah Rembulan was directed by Syamsul Fuad and featured songs written by Rinto Harahap. Sys NS and Iis Sugianto were cast in the leading roles, while Lydia Kandou was cast as another leading woman. Pop singer Chrisye, who had previously had a cameo in 1979's Gita Cinta dari SMA (Love Song at High School) but otherwise never had a role in a film, was convinced to participate by his friend Sys NS; Sys NS asked him \\"when is the next time you will feel what it is like to date a movie star?\\" Chrisye, used to the recording industry where he could record as he wished, was upset by the frequently laid-back nature of production and waiting for others. He occasionally fought with the director and threatened to walk out several times. After filming was finished, he decided never to make another movie. Release and reception Seindah Rembulan was released in 1980 and fairly successful. The theme song continues to be performed, such as at a tribute concert to Rinto Harahap in Jakarta in April 2012, where it was performed by Iis Sugianto in a duet with Marcell. Soundtrack album A soundtrack album also entitled Seindah Rembulan was released along with the film. It featured Iis Sugianto and Chrisye, a pair which Denny Sakrie ‚Äì a reporter with Rolling Stone Indonesia ‚Äì described as being polar opposites in their musical style. It also featured songs sung by other Indonesian artists. The songs were written by Rinto Harahap and Chrisye, after Jockie Soerjoprajogo left the project because of creative differences. The album featured two versions of the theme song. The first, a duet by Sugianto and Chrisye, featured musical direction by Chrisye. The second, directed by Rinto Harahap, had Sugianto perform the song solo.

Character and materials The form of the symphony (along with those of its predecessors) owes a great debt to the symphonies of Sibelius, in this case particularly the Seventh (; ). However, its sense of space, ‚Äúless architectural than that of the previous symphonies, is a significant new departure, allowing a more relaxed attitude toward musical objects: closer to the Mahlerian aesthetic than at any time since the 1960s‚Äù . Davies has also cited the often canonic modal counterpoint of Sibelius's Sixth Symphony as an influence, and Sibelius's tone poem En saga has also been mentioned as a possible source of inspiration . Instrumentation The symphony is scored for 2 flutes (second doubling alto flute), piccolo, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, double bassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (marimba, glockenspiel, crotales, flexatone, 2 bass drums [small and large], cymbals, suspended cymbal, tambourine), celesta, harp, and strings. Analysis On the model of Sibelius‚Äôs Seventh, the symphony suggests the traditional four- movement form, but is cast in a single movement. It nevertheless forms an \\"archipelago of 34 sections of various length\\" . The Symphony is based on material from Davies's 1993 youth-orchestra composition Chat Moss, which in turn is derived from two plainchants, the Easter Gradual \\"Haec dies\\" and the Good Friday Tract \\"Domine audivi\\" from Habakkuk 3:3 . It begins with an expansive adagio introduction, followed by music of great energy, characterised by an alternation of stable and unstable episodes . The overall tonality of D/C with a G secondary pole is established at the outset in a woodwind trio, followed by undisguised modal melodies in the violins and flute. The succeeding faster music reaches a first climax in a Davies hallmark of ascending brass figures with powerful, sustained tritones in the horns that forecast a bigger climax to come, an affirmational brass theme at rehearsal Q2 which \\"seems to rise as if from the sea, magnifying the fragile flute melody heard at N2 into sudden immensity\\" .

The technique, which was initially instilled by Bobb McKittrick, the offensive line coach of the San Francisco 49ers from 1979 to 1999, is often criticized as being \\"dirty.\\" Additionally, it is illegal for an offensive player to \\"cut\\" a defensive player already engaged with another offensive player. This is considered a \\"chop block.\\" In the NCAA, cut blocking is allowed as long as the block is away from the original position of the ball. The Fall Experimental Football League banned use of the cut block. Use in the NFL McKittrick was credited as the first to implement cut blocking in his offensive line schemes as the offensive line coach of the 49ers. Les Steckel, the offensive line coach for the Houston Oilers from 1995 to 1999, used cut blocking techniques. Mike Shanahan, the 49ers' offensive coordinator from 1992 to 1994, became the Denver Broncos' head coach in 1995, and brought Alex Gibbs along to become his offensive line coach. In the span from 1995 to 2003 in which Gibbs coached the team's offensive line and implemented the cut blocking technique, the Broncos won two Super Bowls (XXXII and XXXIII). Shanahan remained the Broncos' head coach until 2008, and Gibbs was hired by the Atlanta Falcons in 2004. He implemented the technique in his three seasons with the Falcons before he was hired by Gary Kubiak, the offensive coordinator of the Broncos in his time there, to become the offensive line coach of the Houston Texans in 2008. In a Monday Night Football game between the Broncos and Cincinnati Bengals on October 25, 2004, offensive tackle George Foster of the Broncos legally used a cut block on defensive tackle Tony Williams of the Bengals, which resulted in a dislocation and fracture of Williams' ankle.

It was built in 1957 and added onto in 1977. History According to the 1963 Roundup (school yearbook), the area in which Glencliff High School is located was until recent years fertile farmland lying on the outskirts of Nashville. This section remained largely unpopulated until the late 1950s, at which time industrial expansion and metropolitan growth led to extensive residential development, which yet continues to characterize this area. Dominated by such industrial and commercial establishments as AVCO, Aladdin Industries, and the Municipal Airport, the area inevitably grew, attracting secondary businesses, churches, schools, and finally a high school. Glencliff High School takes its name from the Glencliff Estate. The site of the school is a part of the original property of one of Nashville's oldest families, W. A. Woodroof. The Glencliff Mansion, which is still standing on what is the Mill Creek Valley Road (old name) or Antioch Pike (new name), was the home of that family. The house predates the American Civil War, and within the vicinity of it General Buell amassed his forces during the Battle of Nashville. Glencliff High School for the first time in 1957 opened its doors to receive 350 seventh and eighth graders and 13 faculty members. Five years later, the spring of 1962, the first senior class composed of 125 members was graduated. The school now has a student body of around 1,400 students and 80 faculty members. Glencliff High School is one of the most diverse schools in Tennessee. There are more than 42 different nationalities and 26 languages represented in its student population. It has four academies ‚Äî the Freshman Academy, the Academy of Medical Science and Research (AMSR), the Ford Academy of Business and Innovation (FABI), and the Hands on Nashville Academy for Environmental and Urban Planning (HONEUP). Students are taught skills in courses like webpage design, engineering and medical terminology. They can participate in the dual-credit program with National State Community College to earn credits in personal finance, medical terminology and agricultural science. The culinary arts program is one of Glencliff's programs. Outside of the academies, Glencliff offers advanced placement (AP) classes and special college-prep support (AVID) for students who have college aspirations and are in the academic middle.

This is achieved by measuring neural activity in these regions via functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), comparing this to the ideal pattern of neural activation in these regions (for the intended purpose), and giving subjects feedback on how close their current pattern of neural activity is to the ideal pattern. Without explicit knowledge of what they are supposed to be doing or thinking about, over time participants learn to induce this ideal pattern of neural activation. Corresponding to this, their 'knowledge' or way of thinking has been found to change accordingly. Experiments conducted in 2011 at Boston University (BU) and ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in Kyoto, Japan demonstrated that volunteers were able to quickly solve complex visual puzzles they had not previously had exposure to. They did so by receiving the brain patterns of other volunteers who had already learned to solve the puzzles through trial and error methods. The research has far-reaching implications for treating patients with various learning disabilities, mental illness, memory problems, and motor functionality impairments.

Murphy was carrying a shipment of gold from the Yukon Mine Company. Local radio announcer Uncle Dimwittie (Dewey Robinson), has bugged the mine office, and is secretly transmitting information about gold shipments, in the guise of reading children's stories on the air. The messages are picked up by a gang led by a crook named Morgan (William Pawley). They have forced Professor Lewis (Joe De Stefani) to work on a powerful ray gun invented by a scientist named Speavy (Dwight Frye). The radio beam the weapon sends out disables aircraft engines. Speavy is worried that his invention is being used by the crooks, and tries to warn Renfrew, but the scientist is killed by Morgan. Madeleine (Louise Stanley), the daughter of Professor Lewis, tries to help Renfrew who finds a laboratory that Morgan is operating but it is destroyed. When no one on the force believes he has discovered the secret of the lost aircraft, Renfrew volunteers to fly the next gold shipment. Madeleine stows away on board the aircraft Renfrew is piloting. Morgan and his gang are also in the air, and while the professor can bring down Renfrew with the ray gun, but he turns it, instead on Morgan's aircraft. Constable Kelly then rides to Morgan's hideout and, with the professor's help, arrests the rest of the gang. Cast * James Newill as Sgt.

It can also be prepared by laboratory synthesis. Chemically, it is a polyphenol and a benzoquinone.  Occurrences  Atromentin has been found in cultures of Clitocybe subilludens and in extracts of Hydnellum peckii. The first enzymes in its biosynthesis have been characterized in Tapinella panuoides. One of those is called atromentin synthetase.Atromentin synthetase on www.uniprot.org  Biological activities  A number of in vitro biological actives of atromentin have been studied. Atromentin possesses in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibiting the enzyme enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (essential for the biosynthesis of fatty acids) in the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae. Atromentin has been shown to be a smooth muscle stimulant. It also induces apoptosis in isolated human leukemia U937 cells.Atromentin-Induced Apoptosis in Human Leukemia U937 Cells. Kim Jin Hee and Choong Hwan Lee, Journal of microbiology and biotechnology, 2009, vol. 19, no9, pages 946-950, It is also an anticoagulant. Genetic and enzymatic basis of atromentin Atromentin is catalyzed from two units of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid (4-HPP) via a nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like enzyme (atromentin synthetase), containg the domain architecture adenylation- thiolation-thioesterase (A-T-TE). 4-HPP is produced from a deamination via an aminotransferase. The genetic basis of these two genes is clustered (i.e., adjacent to one another). These enzymes were first characterized in Tapinella panuoides by overexpressing the respective genes (AtrA and AtrD) in E. coli and incubating the holo-enzyme with 4-HPP to observe the formation of atromentin. This was followed by characterization of the enzyme GreA in Suillus grevillei, six (InvA1-6, of which InvA1, 2 and 5 were functional) in Paxillus involutus, and NPS3 from Serpula lacrymans. In addition, there is another adjacent and conserved gene encoding for an alcohol dehydrogenase/oxidoreductase whose function is unclear. In most cases the clustered biosynthetic genes are found orthologous in basidiomycetes. A common promoter motif was found shared between the atromentin synthetase and aminotransferase of 23 different atromentin-producing basidiomycetes that was in almost all cases absent from the alcohol dehydrogenase, indicating co- regulation of the two essential genes that ensure atromentin production by a common transcription factor. Additional promoter motifs were identified preceding the atromentin genes for ectomycorrihzae that were absent from brown rotters, indicating dissimilar genetic regulation of atromentin. The genes for the atromentin synthetase and aminotransferase from S. lacrymans were up- regulated during co-incubation with bacteria. Amino acid nonribosomal code for biosynthesis The nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like enzyme (atromentin synthetase) that symmetrically condenses two monomers of 4-HPP has an adenylation domain that accepts the substrates before catalysis. The acceptor domain contains a 10 amino acid code known as the Nonribosomal Code (NRPS code). Here, the example of the atromentin synthetase from Suills grevillei, GreA, is used. The code is found at amino acid positions 235 (V), 236 (A), 239 (E), 278 (F), 299 (S), 301 (G), 322 (G), 320 (A), 331 (C), 517 (K). The code aligns with atromentin synthetases from S. lacrymans (NPS3), Tapinella panuoides (AtrA), and Paxillus involutus (InvAs). Similarly, the NRPS code for atromentin production supports the universal code for other aromatic alpha- keto acid-derived compounds, such those from L-phenylalanine like ralfuranone B via phenylpyruvic acid, and from L-tryptophane like didemethyl asterriquinone D via indole-3-pyruvic acid (note atromentin is derived from the aromatic alpha-keto acid L-tyrosine via 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid). For InvAs from Paxillus involutus, a common amino acid motif was also found in the thioesterase domain (last domain) that supported biochemical data of either the enzyme being functional to complete atromentin formation or not. Biosynthesis of atromentin The aromatic amino acid L-tyrosin is the precursor to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid, and 2 units of 4-HPP are condensed to form atromentin. The initial step is deamination via an aminotransferase. The second step is catalyzed by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like enzyme (NRPS-like, because it does not have a canonical condensation domain, called the atromentin/quinone synthetase). The adenylation domain of this NRPS-like enzyme accepts 4-HPP as determined by the ATP-PPi-exchange assay. The enzyme, when produced in E. coli, needs to be primed to its holo form via a phosphopantetheinyl transferase (Ppant), although E. coli can in vivo prime the apo-enzyme (e.g. via EntD). Ppants have been successfully used from cDNA derived from A. nidulans (e.g. NpgA), Streptomyces verticillus (Svp), and Paxillus involutus (PptA). A few studies, notably from the bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis by Biggins et al., have shown that the aminotransferase gene may be absent, and this activity can be supplied via its primary metabolism. Congener pigments Atromentin is the precursor to various other pigments. Pulvinic acid type family include variegatic acid, xerocomic acid, homoxerocomic acid, isoxerocomic acid, atromentic acid, variegatorubin, xerocomorubin, and other modified derivatives. The main pulvinic acid type pigments were found secreted during co-incubation with bacteria or introduction to high organic nitrogen content (compared to growth on a non-inducing medium containing inorganic nitrogen). Diarylcyclopentenones include involutin, involuton, gyrocycanin, gyroporin (oxidized variant of gyrocyanin), anhydroinvolutin, and chamonixin. Although strucurally similar, grevillins (A-D) are derived from 4-HPP, the precursor to atromentin. The grevillins are a chemotaxonomic marker for the genus Suillus. Modifications of atromentin include leucoatromentin, leucomentin-3, leucomentin-4, and cylcoleucomelone. Additionally, thelephoric acid is a derivative that is from the thelephoroid clade. The various enzymes involved in the formation of these pigments aside from the genetic and enzymatic basis for the production of its precursor atromentin is unknown. Redundant biosynthesis In Paxillus involutus, six nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like enzymes were identified in the annotated genome that is available via the JGI MycoCosm portal. These genes, termed InvA1,2,3,4,5 and 6, were overexpressed in E. coli and the genes were characterized by co-incubating the apo-enzyme with 4-HPP to determine the formation of atromentin as noted by its characteristic UV-Vis spectrum and monoisotopic mass. Three of the six enzymes were found to be functional. This showed an unprecedented redundancy for atromentin production in a basidiomycete.

She ruled from 1517 to her death.  Early life  Maria was the third child of the East Frisian chieftain, Edo Wiemken the Younger, and his second wife, Heilwig. Her mother was sister of Count John V of Oldenburg. Her mother died when she was one year old and her father when she about 10 years later. After her father's death, a council of five village elders took up the regency and guardianship of his children. Her brother Christopher was given a suitable education to become the next Lord of Jeverland. Maria and her two sisters were raised to marry economically and politically favorable prospects.  Succession Problems  However, Lord Christopher suddenly died at the age of 18. This drastically changed the situation. Since there was no male heir, Maria inherited the Jeverland. Edzard I, Count of East Frisia, demonstrated his military strength at the common border. With the approval of the regents, he concluded a marriage contract, which made him protector of Jeverland. Maria seemed destined to marry one of Edzard's sons. However, the future counts Enno and John couldn't wait until the marriage and occupied Jever Castle in 1527, exposing her to severe humiliation. The East Frisian Landdrost Boing of Oldersum, who was probably in love with Maria, drove the invaders out of Jeverland. However, he died during a siege of Wittmund and Maria never married.  Lady of Jeverland  Monument to Maria of Jever, near Jever castle, by Harro Magnussen. In 1531, in order do defend her rule against local rivals and enemies, Maria made the unusual decision of requesting assistance from Emperor Charles V, to assert her independence and secure her role against her neighbors. As Count of Holland and Duke of Brabant, he took possession of Jeverland and then gave it back to her as a fief. Thus, while the Emperor protected her right to rule, she ended the imperial immediacy Jeverland had enjoyed since 1417. Due to this, however, she was finally able to gain sole control over Jever. In the subsequent years, Maria managed to defend her father's inheritance and gradually got a grip on the business of government. Some sources state that this was due to her strong will and growing desire for independence. Initially opposed to the Reformation, she introduced Lutheranism in Jever in 1532. Maria has been described as a good ruler who did much for her territory. She benefitted trade and made sure that the justice system and law and order was respected. She stimulated the administration of justice and gave Jever city rights in 1536. She expanded her castle and enlarged her territory by creating new polders and locks, which allowed agriculture and commerce to flourish. In 1556, Maria converted the choir of the city church, which had been damaged several times, into a grave chapel. Between 1561 and 1564, a Renaissance grave monument for her father was erected in the chapel. This monument still exists.  Death  Maria died in 1575, after nearly fifty years in government. Her death was initially kept secret for fear that the Counts of East Frisia might grab power. Her room was sealed and food was placed outside her door. A servant is said to have secretly eaten the food so no suspicion would arise until Maria's rightful heir, Count John VII of Oldenburg, had arrived.

A natural extension of the representation leads to a semigroup of contraction operators, introduced as the oscillator semigroup by Roger Howe in 1988. The semigroup had previously been studied by other mathematicians and physicists, most notably Felix Berezin in the 1960s. The simplest example in one dimension is given by SU(1,1). It acts as M√∂bius transformations on the extended complex plane, leaving the unit circle invariant. In that case the oscillator representation is a unitary representation of a double cover of SU(1,1) and the oscillator semigroup corresponds to a representation by contraction operators of the semigroup in SL(2,C) corresponding to M√∂bius transformations that take the unit disk into itself. The contraction operators, determined only up to a sign, have kernels that are Gaussian functions. On an infinitesimal level the semigroup is described by a cone in the Lie algebra of SU(1,1) that can be identified with a light cone. The same framework generalizes to the symplectic group in higher dimensions, including its analogue in infinite dimensions. This article explains the theory for SU(1,1) in detail and summarizes how the theory can be extended. Historical overview The mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics by Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schr√∂dinger was originally in terms of unbounded self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space. The fundamental operators corresponding to position and momentum satisfy the Heisenberg commutation relations. Quadratic polynomials in these operators, which include the harmonic oscillator, are also closed under taking commutators. A large amount of operator theory was developed in the 1920s and 1930s to provide a rigorous foundation for quantum mechanics. Part of the theory was formulated in terms of unitary groups of operators, largely through the contributions of Hermann Weyl, Marshall Stone and John von Neumann. In turn these results in mathematical physics were subsumed within mathematical analysis, starting with the 1933 lecture notes of Norbert Wiener, who used the heat kernel for the harmonic oscillator to derive the properties of the Fourier transform. The uniqueness of the Heisenberg commutation relations, as formulated in the Stone‚Äìvon Neumann theorem, was later interpreted within group representation theory, in particular the theory of induced representations initiated by George Mackey. The quadratic operators were understood in terms of a projective unitary representation of the group SU(1,1) and its Lie algebra. Irving Segal and David Shale generalized this construction to the symplectic group in finite and infinite dimensions‚Äîin physics, this is often referred to as bosonic quantization: it is constructed as the symmetric algebra of an infinite-dimensional space. Segal and Shale have also treated the case of fermionic quantization, which is constructed as the exterior algebra of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. In the special case of conformal field theory in 1+1 dimensions, the two versions become equivalent via the so-called \\"boson-fermion correspondence.\\" Not only does this apply in analysis where there are unitary operators between bosonic and fermionic Hilbert spaces, but also in the mathematical theory of vertex operator algebras. Vertex operators themselves originally arose in the late 1960s in theoretical physics, particularly in string theory. Andr√© Weil later extended the construction to p-adic Lie groups, showing how the ideas could be applied in number theory, in particular to give a group theoretic explanation of theta functions and quadratic reciprocity. Several physicists and mathematicians observed the heat kernel operators corresponding to the harmonic oscillator were associated to a complexification of SU(1,1): this was not the whole of SL(2,C), but instead a complex semigroup defined by a natural geometric condition. The representation theory of this semigroup, and its generalizations in finite and infinite dimensions, has applications both in mathematics and theoretical physics. Semigroups in SL(2,C) The group: :G = \\\\operatorname{SU}(1,1) = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\left. \\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\alpha & \\\\beta \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\overline{\\\\beta} & \\\\overline{\\\\alpha} \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\right  \\\\alpha^2 -\\\\beta^2=1 \\\\right \\\\\\\\}, is a subgroup of Gc = SL(2,C), the group of complex 2 √ó 2 matrices with determinant 1\\\\. If G1 = SL(2,R) then :G=CG_1C^{-1}, \\\\qquad C=\\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & i \\\\\\\\\\\\ i & 1\\\\end{pmatrix}. This follows since the corresponding M√∂bius transformation is the Cayley transform which carries the upper half plane onto the unit disk and the real line onto the unit circle. The group SL(2,R) is generated as an abstract group by :J=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 0\\\\end{pmatrix} and the subgroup of lower triangular matrices :\\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\left. \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ b & a^{-1}\\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\right  a,b \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}, a >0\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Indeed, the orbit of the vector :v=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1\\\\end{pmatrix} under the subgroup generated by these matrices is easily seen to be the whole of R2 and the stabilizer of v in G1 lies in inside this subgroup. The Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g} of SU(1,1) consists of matrices :\\\\begin{pmatrix} ix & w \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\overline{w} & -ix \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\quad x \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}. The period 2 automorphism œÉ of Gc :\\\\sigma(g)= M \\\\overline{g} M^{-1}, with :M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}, has fixed point subgroup G since :\\\\sigma\\\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & d\\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\overline{d} & \\\\overline{c} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\overline{b} & \\\\overline{a}\\\\end{pmatrix}. Similarly the same formula defines a period two automorphism œÉ of the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}_c of Gc, the complex matrices with trace zero. A standard basis of \\\\mathfrak{g}_c over C is given by :L_0 =\\\\begin{pmatrix} {1\\\\over 2} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -{1\\\\over 2}\\\\end{pmatrix},\\\\quad L_{-1}=\\\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix},\\\\quad L_{1}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 0\\\\end{pmatrix}. Thus for ‚àí1 ‚â§ m, n ‚â§ 1 :[L_m,L_n]=(m-n) L_{m+n}. There is a direct sum decomposition :\\\\mathfrak{g}_c =\\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\oplus i\\\\mathfrak{g}, where \\\\mathfrak{g} is the +1 eigenspace of œÉ and i\\\\mathfrak{g} the ‚Äì1 eigenspace. The matrices X in i\\\\mathfrak{g} have the form : X=\\\\begin{pmatrix} x & w \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\overline{w} & -x \\\\end{pmatrix}. Note that : -\\\\det X = x^2 -w^2. The cone C in i\\\\mathfrak{g} is defined by two conditions. The first is \\\\det X < 0. By definition this condition is preserved under conjugation by G. Since G is connected it leaves the two components with x > 0 and x < 0 invariant. The second condition is x<0. The group Gc acts by M√∂bius transformations on the extended complex plane. The subgroup G acts as automorphisms of the unit disk D. A semigroup H of Gc, first considered by , can be defined by the geometric condition: : g(\\\\overline{D}) \\\\subset D. The semigroup can be described explicitly in terms of the cone C: : H =G\\\\cdot \\\\exp(C) =\\\\exp(C)\\\\cdot G. In fact the matrix X can be conjugated by an element of G to the matrix :Y=\\\\begin{pmatrix} -y & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & y \\\\end{pmatrix} with : y=\\\\sqrt{x^2 - w^2} > 0. Since the M√∂bius transformation corresponding to exp Y sends z to e‚àí2yz, it follows that the right hand side lies in the semigroup. Conversely if g lies in H it carries the closed unit disk onto a smaller closed disk in its interior. Conjugating by an element of G, the smaller disk can be taken to have centre 0. But then for appropriate y, the element e^{-Y}g carries D onto itself so lies in G. A similar argument shows that the closure of H, also a semigroup, is given by :\\\\overline{H}= \\\\\\\\{ g\\\\in \\\\operatorname{SL}(2,\\\\mathbf{C}) gD\\\\subseteq D \\\\\\\\}=G\\\\cdot \\\\exp{\\\\overline{C}} = \\\\exp{\\\\overline{C}}\\\\cdot G. From the above statement on conjugacy, it follows that :H=G A_+ G, where :A_+ = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\left. \\\\begin{pmatrix} e^{-y} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & e^y \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\right  y > 0 \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. If :\\\\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & d\\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\in H then :\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\overline{a} & \\\\overline{b} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\overline{c} & \\\\overline{d}\\\\end{pmatrix},\\\\quad \\\\begin{pmatrix}a & -c \\\\\\\\\\\\ -b & d\\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\in H, since the latter is obtained by taking the transpose and conjugating by the diagonal matrix with entries ¬±1. Hence H also contains :\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\overline{a} & -\\\\overline{c} \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\overline{b} & \\\\overline{d}\\\\end{pmatrix}. which gives the inverse matrix if the original matrix lies in SU(1,1). A further result on conjugacy follows by noting that every element of H must fix a point in D, which by conjugation with an element of G can be taken to be 0\\\\. Then the element of H has the form :M= \\\\begin{pmatrix} a& 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ b & a^{-1} \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\qquad a < 1 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad b < a^{-1} - a. The set of such lower triangular matrices forms a subsemigroup H0 of H. Since :M\\\\begin{pmatrix} x & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & x^{-1}\\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} x & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ ba^{-1}(x-x^{-1}) & x^{-1}\\\\end{pmatrix}M, every matrix in H0 is conjugate to a diagonal matrix by a matrix M in H0. Similarly every one-parameter semigroup S(t) in H fixes the same point in D so is conjugate by an element of G to a one-parameter semigroup in H0. It follows that there is a matrix M in H0 such that :MS(t)=S_0(t)M, with S0(t) diagonal. Similarly there is a matrix N in H0 such that :S(t)N=NS_0(t), The semigroup H0 generates the subgroup L of complex lower triangular matrices with determinant 1 (given by the above formula with a ‚â† 0). Its Lie algebra consists of matrices of the form : Z=\\\\begin{pmatrix} z & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ w & -z\\\\end{pmatrix}. In particular the one parameter semigroup exp tZ lies in H0 for all t > 0 if and only if \\\\Re z < 0 and \\\\Re z > \\\\tfrac{1}{2} w. This follows from the criterion for H or directly from the formula :\\\\exp Z= \\\\begin{pmatrix} e^z & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ f(z) w & e^{-z} \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\qquad f(z)={\\\\sinh z\\\\over z}. The exponential map is known not to be surjective in this case, even though it is surjective on the whole group L. This follows because the squaring operation is not surjective in H. Indeed, since the square of an element fixes 0 only if the original element fixes 0, it suffices to prove this in H0. Take Œ± with Œ± < 1 and :\\\\left \\\\alpha +\\\\alpha^{-1} \\\\right <\\\\alpha +\\\\alpha^{-1}. If a = Œ±2 and :b = (1-\\\\delta) (a^{-1}-a), with :(1-\\\\delta)^2={\\\\alpha +\\\\alpha^{-1}\\\\over \\\\alpha +\\\\alpha^{-1}}, then the matrix : \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ b & a^{-1}\\\\end{pmatrix} has no square root in H0. For a square root would have the form : \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\alpha & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta & \\\\alpha^{-1}\\\\end{pmatrix}. On the other hand, :\\\\beta={b\\\\over \\\\alpha+\\\\alpha^{-1}}={\\\\alpha^{-1} -\\\\alpha\\\\over 1-\\\\delta} > \\\\alpha^{-1} -\\\\alpha. The closed semigroup \\\\overline{H} is maximal in SL(2,C): any larger semigroup must be the whole of SL(2,C). Using computations motivated by theoretical physics, introduced the semigroup H, defined through a set of inequalities. Without identification H as a compression semigroup, they established the maximality of \\\\overline{H}. Using the definition as a compression semigroup, maximality reduces to checking what happens when adding a new fractional transformation g to \\\\overline{H}. The idea of the proof depends on considering the positions of the two discs g(D) and D. In the key cases, either one disc contains the other or they are disjoint. In the simplest cases, g is the inverse of a scaling transformation or g(z)=-1/z. In either case g and H generate an open neigbourhood of 1 and hence the whole of SL(2,C) Later gave another more direct way to prove maximality by first showing that there is a g in S sending D onto the disk Dc, z > 1. In fact if x\\\\in S\\\\setminus\\\\overline{H}, then there is a small disk D1 in D such that xD1 lies in Dc. Then for some h in H, D1 = hD. Similarly yxD1 = Dc for some y in H. So g = yxh lies in S and sends D onto Dc. It follows that g2 fixes the unit disc D so lies in SU(1,1). So g‚àí1 lies in S. If t lies in H then tgD contains gD. Hence g^{-1}t^{-1}g \\\\in \\\\overline{H}. So t‚àí1 lies in S and therefore S contains an open neighbourhood of 1. Hence S = SL(2,C). Exactly the same argument works for M√∂bius transformations on Rn and the open semigroup taking the closed unit sphere x ‚â§ 1 into the open unit sphere x < 1\\\\. The closure is a maximal proper semigroup in the group of all M√∂bius transformations. When n = 1, the closure corresponds to M√∂bius transformations of the real line taking the closed interval [‚Äì1,1] into itself.See: and The semigroup H and its closure have a further piece of structure inherited from G, namely inversion on G extends to an antiautomorphism of H and its closure, which fixes the elements in exp C and its closure. For :g=\\\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & d\\\\end{pmatrix}, the antiautomorphism is given by :g^+=\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\overline{a} & -\\\\overline{c} \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\overline{b} & \\\\overline{d}\\\\end{pmatrix} and extends to an antiautomorphism of SL(2,C). Similarly the antiautomorphism :g^\\\\dagger=\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\overline{d} & -\\\\overline{b} \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\overline{c} & \\\\overline{a}\\\\end{pmatrix} leaves G1 invariant and fixes the elements in exp C1 and its closure, so it has analogous properties for the semigroup in G1. Commutation relations of Heisenberg and Weyl Let \\\\mathcal S be the space of Schwartz functions on R. It is dense in the Hilbert space L2(R) of square- integrable functions on R. Following the terminology of quantum mechanics, the \\"momentum\\" operator P and \\"position\\" operator Q are defined on \\\\mathcal S by :Pf(x)=if'(x),\\\\qquad Qf(x)=xf(x). There operators satisfy the Heisenberg commutation relation :PQ-QP=iI. Both P and Q are self-adjoint for the inner product on \\\\mathcal S inherited from L2(R). Two one parameter unitary groups U(s) and V(t) can be defined on \\\\mathcal S and L2(R) by :U(s)f(x)= f(x-s),\\\\qquad V(t)f(x)=e^{ixt} f(x). By definition :{d\\\\over ds} U(s)f= iP U(s)f,\\\\qquad {d\\\\over dt} V(t)f=iQV(t)f for f\\\\in\\\\mathcal S, so that formally :U(s)=e^{iPs},\\\\qquad V(t)=e^{iQt}. It is immediate from the definition that the one parameter groups U and V satisfy the Weyl commutation relation :U(s)V(t)=e^{-ist}V(t)U(s). The realization of U and V on L2(R) is called the Schr√∂dinger representation. Fourier transform The Fourier transform is defined on \\\\mathcal S by :\\\\widehat{f}(\\\\xi)= {1\\\\over \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x) e^{-ix\\\\xi} \\\\, dx. It defines a continuous map of \\\\mathcal S into itself for its natural topology. Contour integration shows that the function :H_0(x) ={e^{-x^2/2}\\\\over \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} is its own Fourier transform. On the other hand, integrating by parts or differentiating under the integral, :\\\\widehat{Pf}=-Q\\\\widehat{f},\\\\qquad \\\\widehat{Qf} =P\\\\widehat{f}. It follows that the operator on \\\\mathcal S defined by :Tf(x)=\\\\widehat{\\\\widehat f}(-x) commutes with both Q (and P). On the other hand, :TH_0=H_0 and since :g(x)={f(x)-f(a)H_0(x)/H_0(a)\\\\over x-a} lies in \\\\mathcal S, it follows that :T(x-a)g_{x=a}=(x-a)Tg_{x=a}=0 and hence :Tf(a)= f(a). This implies the Fourier inversion formula: :f(x) ={1\\\\over \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\widehat{f}(\\\\xi)e^{ix\\\\xi}\\\\, d\\\\xi and shows that the Fourier transform is an isomorphism of \\\\mathcal S onto itself. By Fubini's theorem :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x)\\\\widehat{g}(x)\\\\, dx= {1\\\\over \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}\\\\iint f(x)g(\\\\xi)e^{-ix\\\\xi} \\\\,dxd\\\\xi=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\widehat{f}(\\\\xi) g(\\\\xi)\\\\, d\\\\xi. When combined with the inversion formula this implies that the Fourier transform preserves the inner product :\\\\left (\\\\widehat{f},\\\\widehat{g} \\\\right ) = (f,g) so defines an isometry of \\\\mathcal S onto itself. By density it extends to a unitary operator on L2(R), as asserted by Plancherel's theorem. Stone‚Äìvon Neumann theorem Suppose U(s) and V(t) are one parameter unitary groups on a Hilbert space \\\\mathcal H satisfying the Weyl commutation relations :U(s)V(t) =e^{-ist} V(t)U(s). For F(s,t)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\mathbf{R}\\\\times \\\\mathbf{R}), let :F^\\\\vee(x,y)={1\\\\over \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty F(t,y) e^{-itx}\\\\, dt and define a bounded operator on \\\\mathcal H by :T(F)=\\\\iint F^\\\\vee(x,x+y)U(x)V(y)\\\\,dxdy. Then :\\\\begin{align} T(F)T(G)&=T(F\\\\star G)\\\\\\\\\\\\ T(F)^* &= T(F^*) \\\\end{align} where :\\\\begin{align} (F\\\\star G)(x,y)&=\\\\int F(x,z)G(z,y) \\\\, dz \\\\\\\\\\\\ F^*(x,y)&=\\\\overline{F(y,x)} \\\\end{align} The operators T(F) have an important non-degeneracy property: the linear span of all vectors T(F)Œæ is dense in \\\\mathcal H. Indeed, if fds and gdt define probability measures with compact support, then the smeared operators :U(f)=\\\\int U(s) f(s) \\\\, ds,\\\\qquad V(g)=\\\\int V(t) g(t)\\\\, dt satisfy :\\\\U(f)\\\\, \\\\V(g)\\\\ \\\\le 1 and converge in the strong operator topology to the identity operator if the supports of the measures decrease to 0. Since U(f)V(g) has the form T(F), non-degeneracy follows. When \\\\mathcal H is the Schr√∂dinger representation on L2(R), the operator T(F) is given by : T(F)f(x)=\\\\int F(x,y)f(y) \\\\, dy. It follows from this formula that U and V jointly act irreducibly on the Schr√∂dinger representation since this is true for the operators given by kernels that are Schwartz functions. Conversely given a representation of the Weyl commutation relations on \\\\mathcal H, it gives rise to a non-degenerate representation of the *-algebra of kernel operators. But all such representations are on an orthogonal direct sum of copies of L2(R) with the action on each copy as above. This is a straightforward generalisation of the elementary fact that the representations of the N √ó N matrices are on direct sums of the standard representation on CN. The proof using matrix units works equally well in infinite dimensions. The one parameter unitary groups U and V leave each component invariant, inducing the standard action on the Schr√∂dinger representation. In particular this implies the Stone‚Äìvon Neumann theorem: the Schr√∂dinger representation is the unique irreducible representation of the Weyl commutation relations on a Hilbert space. Oscillator representation of SL(2,R) Given U and V satisfying the Weyl commutation relations, define :W(x,y)=e^{\\\\frac{ixy}{2}}U(x)V(y). Then :W(x_1,y_1)W(x_2,y_2)=e^{i(x_1y_2-y_1x_2)} W(x_1+x_2,y_1+y_2), so that W defines a projective unitary representation of R2 with cocycle given by :\\\\omega(z_1,z_2) = e^{iB(z_1,z_2)}, where z=x+iy=(x,y) and B is the symplectic form on R2 given by :B(z_1,z_2)=x_1y_2-y_1x_2=\\\\Im z_1\\\\overline {z_2}. By the Stone‚Äìvon Neumann theorem, there is a unique irreducible representation corresponding to this cocycle. It follows that if g is an automorphism of R2 preserving the form B, i.e. an element of SL(2,R), then there is a unitary œÄ(g) on L2(R) satisfying the covariance relation :\\\\pi(g) W(z) \\\\pi(g)^* = W(g(z)). By Schur's lemma the unitary œÄ(g) is unique up to multiplication by a scalar Œ∂ with Œ∂ = 1, so that œÄ defines a projective unitary representation of SL(2,R). This can be established directly using only the irreducibility of the Schr√∂dinger representation. Irreducibility was a direct consequence of the fact the operators :\\\\iint K(x,y) U(x)V(y) \\\\, dxdy, with K a Schwartz function correspond exactly to operators given by kernels with Schwartz functions. These are dense in the space of Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt operators, which, since it contains the finite rank operators, acts irreducibly. The existence of œÄ can be proved using only the irreducibility of the Schr√∂dinger representation. The operators are unique up to a sign with :\\\\pi(gh)=\\\\pm \\\\pi(g)\\\\pi(h), so that the 2-cocycle for the projective representation of SL(2,R) takes values ¬±1. In fact the group SL(2,R) is generated by matrices of the form :g_1=\\\\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & a^{-1} \\\\end{pmatrix},\\\\,\\\\, g_2=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ b & 1\\\\end{pmatrix},\\\\,\\\\, g_3=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 0\\\\end{pmatrix}, and it can be verified directly that the following operators satisfy the covariance relations above: :\\\\pi(g_1)f(x)=\\\\pm a^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} f(a^{-1}x),\\\\,\\\\, \\\\pi(g_2)f(x) =\\\\pm e^{-ibx^2} f(x),\\\\,\\\\, \\\\pi(g_3)f(x)=\\\\pm e^{\\\\frac{i\\\\pi}{8}} \\\\widehat{f}(x). The generators gi satisfy the following Bruhat relations, which uniquely specify the group SL(2,R): :g_3^2=g_1(-1) ,\\\\,\\\\, g_3 g_1(a)g_3^{-1}=g_1(a^{-1}),\\\\,\\\\, g_1(a) g_2(b) g_1(a)^{-1}=g_2(a^{-2}b),\\\\,\\\\, g_1(a)=g_3 g_2(a^{-1}) g_3 g_2(a) g_3 g_2(a^{-1}). It can be verified by direct calculation that these relations are satisfied up to a sign by the corresponding operators, which establishes that the cocycle takes values ¬±1. There is a more conceptual explanation using an explicit construction of the metaplectic group as a double cover of SL(2,R). SL(2,R) acts by M√∂bius transformations on the upper half plane H. Moreover, if :g=\\\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & d\\\\end{pmatrix}, then :{dg(z)\\\\over dz} = {1\\\\over (cz+d)^2}. The function :m(g,z)=cz+d satisfies the 1-cocycle relation :m(gh,z)=m(g,hz)m(h,z). For each g, the function m(g,z) is non-vanishing on H and therefore has two possible holomorphic square roots. The metaplectic group is defined as the group :\\\\operatorname{Mp}(2,\\\\mathbf R)=\\\\\\\\{(g,G)G(z)^2=m(g,z)\\\\\\\\}. By definition it is a double cover of SL(2,R) and is connected. Multiplication is given by :(g,G)\\\\cdot (h,H)=(gh,K), where :K(z)=G(hz)H(z). Thus for an element g of the metaplectic group there is a uniquely determined function m(g,z)1/2 satisfying the 1-cocycle relation. If \\\\Im z > 0, then :f_z(x) = e^{izx^2/2} lies in L2 and is called a coherent state. These functions lie in a single orbit of SL(2,R) generated by :f_i(x) = e^{-\\\\frac{x^2}{2}}, since for g in SL(2,R) :\\\\pi((g^t)^{-1})f_z(x)= \\\\pm m(g,z)^{-1/2}f_{gz}(x). More specifically if g lies in Mp(2,R) then :\\\\pi((g^t)^{-1})f_z(x)= m(g,z)^{-1/2}f_{gz}(x). Indeed, if this holds for g and h, it also holds for their product. On the other hand, the formula is easily checked if gt has the form gi and these are generators. This defines an ordinary unitary representation of the metaplectic group. The element (1,‚Äì1) acts as multiplication by ‚Äì1 on L2(R), from which it follows that the cocycle on SL(2,R) takes only values ¬±1. Maslov index As explained in , the 2-cocycle on SL(2,R) associated with the metaplectic representation, taking values ¬±1, is determined by the Maslov index. Given three non-zero vectors u, v, w in the plane, their Maslov index \\\\tau(u,v,w) is defined as the signature of the quadratic form on R3 defined by :Q(a,b,c)=abB(u,v)+bcB(v,w) + caB(w,u). Properties of the Maslov index: * it depends on the one-dimensional subpaces spanned by the vectors * it is invariant under SL(2,R) * it is alternating in its arguments, i.e. its sign changes if two of the arguments are interchanged * it vanishes if two of the subspaces coincide * it takes the values ‚Äì1, 0 and +1: if u and v satisfy B(u,v) = 1 and w = au + bv, then the Maslov index is zero is if ab = 0 and is otherwise equal to minus the sign of ab *\\\\displaystyle{\\\\tau(v,w,z) - \\\\tau(u,w,z) + \\\\tau(u,v,z) - \\\\tau(u,v,w)=0} Picking a non-zero vector u0, it follows that the function :\\\\Omega(g,h)=\\\\exp -{\\\\pi i\\\\over 4}\\\\tau(u_0,gu_0,ghu_0) defines a 2-cocycle on SL(2,R) with values in the eighth roots of unity. A modification of the 2-cocycle can be used to define a 2-cocycle with values in ¬±1 connected with the metaplectic cocycle. In fact given non-zero vectors u, v in the plane, define f(u,v) to be * i times the sign of B(u,v) if u and v are not proportional * the sign of Œª if u = Œªv. If :b(g)=f(u_0, gu_0), then :\\\\Omega(g,h)^2 =b(gh)b(g)^{-1}b(h)^{-1}. The representatives œÄ(g) in the metaplectic representation can be chosen so that :\\\\pi(gh) =\\\\omega(g,h) \\\\pi(g)\\\\pi(h) where the 2-cocycle œâ is given by :\\\\omega(g,h) =\\\\Omega(g,h) \\\\beta(gh)^{-1}\\\\beta(g)\\\\beta(h), with :\\\\beta(g)^{2}=b(g). Holomorphic Fock space Holomorphic Fock space (also known as the Segal‚ÄìBargmann space) is defined to be the vector space \\\\mathcal F of holomorphic functions f(z) on C with :{1\\\\over \\\\pi} \\\\iint_{\\\\mathbf C} f(z)^2 e^{-z^2} \\\\, dxdy finite. It has inner product :(f_1,f_2)= {1\\\\over \\\\pi} \\\\iint_{\\\\mathbf C} f_1(z)\\\\overline{f_2(z)} e^{-z^2} \\\\, dxdy. \\\\mathcal F is a Hilbert space with orthonormal basis :e_n(z)={z^n\\\\over \\\\sqrt{n!}}, \\\\quad n \\\\ge 0. Moreover, the power series expansion of a holomorphic function in \\\\mathcal F gives its expansion with respect to this basis. Thus for z in C :f(z) =\\\\left\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} a_n z^n\\\\right\\\\le \\\\f\\\\ e^{z^2/2}, so that evaluation at z is gives a continuous linear functional on \\\\mathcal F. In fact :f(a) =(f,E_a) where :E_a(z)=\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} {(E_a,e_n)z^n\\\\over \\\\sqrt{n!}}=\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} {z^n\\\\overline{a}^n\\\\over n!} = e^{z\\\\overline{a}}. Thus in particular \\\\mathcal F is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. For f in \\\\mathcal F and z in C define :W_{\\\\mathcal F}(z)f(w)=e^{-z^2/2} e^{w\\\\overline{z}} f(w-z). Then :W_{\\\\mathcal F}(z_1)W_{\\\\mathcal F}(z_2)= e^{-i\\\\Im z_1\\\\overline{z_2}} W_{\\\\mathcal F}(z_1+z_2), so this gives a unitary representation of the Weyl commutation relations. Now :W_{\\\\mathcal F}(a)E_0=e^{-a^2/2} E_a. It follows that the representation W_{\\\\mathcal F} is irreducible. Indeed, any function orthogonal to all the Ea must vanish, so that their linear span is dense in \\\\mathcal F. If P is an orthogonal projection commuting with W(z), let f = PE0. Then :f(z)=(PE_0,E_z)=e^{z^2}(PE_0,W_{\\\\mathcal F}(z)E_0)=(PE_{-z},E_0)=\\\\overline{f(-z)}. The only holomorphic function satisfying this condition is the constant function. So :PE_0=\\\\lambda E_0, with Œª = 0 or 1. Since E0 is cyclic, it follows that P = 0 or I. By the Stone‚Äìvon Neumann theorem there is a unitary operator \\\\mathcal U from L2(R) onto \\\\mathcal F, unique up to multiplication by a scalar, intertwining the two representations of the Weyl commutation relations. By Schur's lemma and the Gelfand‚ÄìNaimark construction, the matrix coefficient of any vector determines the vector up to a scalar multiple. Since the matrix coefficients of F = E0 and f = H0 are equal, it follows that the unitary \\\\mathcal U is uniquely determined by the properties :W_{\\\\mathcal F}(a) \\\\mathcal{U} = \\\\mathcal{U} W(a) and :\\\\mathcal{U}H_0 = E_0. Hence for f in L2(R) :\\\\mathcal{U}f(z)= (\\\\mathcal{U}f,E_z) = (f,\\\\mathcal{U}^* E_z) = e^{-z^2}(f,\\\\mathcal{U}^* W_{\\\\mathcal F}(z)E_0) =e^{-z^2}(W(-z)f,H_0), so that :\\\\mathcal{U}f(z) ={1\\\\over \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-(x^2 +y^2)} e^{-2ixy}f(t+x) e^{-t^2/2} \\\\, dt ={1\\\\over \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty B(z,t) f(t)\\\\, dt, where :B(z,t)= \\\\exp [-z^2 -t^2/2 +zt]. The operator \\\\mathcal U is called the Segal‚ÄìBargmann transform and B is called the Bargmann kernel. The adjoint of \\\\mathcal U is given by the formula: :\\\\mathcal{U}^*F(t)={1\\\\over \\\\pi} \\\\iint_{\\\\mathbf C} B(\\\\overline{z},t) F(z)\\\\, dx dy. Fock model The action of SU(1,1) on holomorphic Fock space was described by and . The metaplectic double cover of SU(1,1) can be constructed explicitly as pairs (g, Œ≥) with :g=\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\alpha & \\\\beta \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\overline{\\\\beta} & \\\\overline{\\\\alpha} \\\\end{pmatrix} and :\\\\gamma^2=\\\\alpha. If g = g1g2, then :\\\\gamma = \\\\gamma_1\\\\gamma_2\\\\left(1 +{\\\\beta_1\\\\overline{\\\\beta_2}\\\\over \\\\alpha_1\\\\alpha_2}\\\\right)^{1/2}, using the power series expansion of (1 + z)1/2 for z < 1\\\\. The metaplectic representation is a unitary representation œÄ(g, Œ≥) of this group satisfying the covariance relations :\\\\pi(g,\\\\gamma) W_{\\\\mathcal F}(z) \\\\pi(g,\\\\gamma)^*= W_{\\\\mathcal F}(g\\\\cdot z), where :g\\\\cdot z=\\\\alpha z + \\\\beta \\\\overline{z}. Since \\\\mathcal F is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, any bounded operator T on it corresponds to a kernel given by a power series of its two arguments. In fact if :K_T(a,b)=(TE_{\\\\overline{b}},E_a), and F in \\\\mathcal F, then :TF(a)=(TF,E_a)=(F,T^*E_a)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\iint_{\\\\mathbf C} F(z)\\\\overline{(T^*E_a,E_z)} e^{-z^2}\\\\, dx dy=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\iint_{\\\\mathbf C} K_T(a,\\\\overline{z}) F(z)e^{-z^2}\\\\, dxdy. The covariance relations and analyticity of the kernel imply that for S = œÄ(g, Œ≥), :K_S(a,z)=C \\\\cdot \\\\exp\\\\,{1\\\\over 2\\\\alpha}(\\\\overline{\\\\beta} z^2 + 2az - \\\\beta a^2) for some constant C. Direct calculation shows that :C=\\\\gamma^{-1} leads to an ordinary representation of the double cover. Coherent states can again be defined as the orbit of E0 under the metaplectic group. For w complex, set :F_w(z)=e^{wz^2/2}. Then F_w \\\\in \\\\mathcal F if and only if w < 1\\\\. In particular F0 = 1 = E0. Moreover, :\\\\pi(g,\\\\gamma)F_w= (\\\\overline{\\\\alpha} +\\\\overline{\\\\beta}w)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} F_{gw}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\overline{\\\\gamma}} \\\\left(1+{\\\\overline{\\\\beta}\\\\over \\\\overline{\\\\alpha}}w\\\\right)^{-1/2}F_{gw}, where :gw={\\\\alpha w + \\\\beta\\\\over \\\\overline{\\\\beta}w + \\\\overline{\\\\alpha}}. Similarly the functions zFw lie in \\\\mathcal F and form an orbit of the metaplectic group: :\\\\pi(g,\\\\gamma)[zF_w](z)= (\\\\overline{\\\\alpha} +\\\\overline{\\\\beta}w)^{-3/2} zF_{gw}(z). Since (Fw, E0) = 1, the matrix coefficient of the function E0 = 1 is given by :(\\\\pi(g,\\\\gamma)1,1)=\\\\gamma^{-1}. Disk model The projective representation of SL(2,R) on L2(R) or on \\\\mathcal F break up as a direct sum of two irreducible representations, corresponding to even and odd functions of x or z. The two representations can be realized on Hilbert spaces of holomorphic functions on the unit disk; or, using the Cayley transform, on the upper half plane. The even functions correspond to holomorphic functions F+ for which :{1\\\\over 2\\\\pi}\\\\iint F_+(z)^2 (1-z^2)^{-1/2} \\\\,dx dy+ {2\\\\over \\\\pi} \\\\iint F'_+(z)^2(1-z^2)^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\, dxdy is finite; and the odd functions to holomorphic functions F‚Äì for which :{1\\\\over 2\\\\pi}\\\\iint F_-(z)^2 (1-z^2)^{-1/2} \\\\,dx dy is finite. The polarized forms of these expressions define the inner products. The action of the metaplectic group is given by :\\\\begin{align} \\\\pi_\\\\pm(g^{-1})F_\\\\pm(z) &= \\\\left (\\\\overline{\\\\beta} z + \\\\overline{\\\\alpha} \\\\right )^{-1\\\\pm \\\\frac{1}{2}} F_\\\\pm(gz) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\left (-\\\\overline{\\\\beta} z + \\\\alpha \\\\right)^{-1\\\\pm \\\\frac{1}{2}} F_\\\\pm\\\\left({\\\\overline{\\\\alpha} z -\\\\beta\\\\over -\\\\overline{\\\\beta} z + \\\\alpha}\\\\right) && g= \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\alpha & \\\\beta \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\overline{\\\\beta} & \\\\overline{\\\\alpha}\\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\end{align} Irreducibility of these representations is established in a standard way. Each representation breaks up as a direct sum of one dimensional eigenspaces of the rotation group each of which is generated by a C‚àû vector for the whole group. It follows that any closed invariant subspace is generated by the algebraic direct sum of eigenspaces it contains and that this sum is invariant under the infinitesimal action of the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g. On the other hand, that action is irreducible. The isomorphism with even and odd functions in \\\\mathcal F can be proved using the Gelfand‚ÄìNaimark construction since the matrix coefficients associated to 1 and z in the corresponding representations are proportional. gave another method starting from the maps :U_+(F)(w)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\iint_{\\\\mathbf C} F(z) e^{\\\\frac{1}{2} w\\\\overline{z}^2} e^{-z^2} \\\\, dx dy, :U_-(F)(w)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\iint_{\\\\mathbf C} F(z) \\\\overline{z}e^{\\\\frac{1}{2} w \\\\overline{z}^2} e^{-z^2} \\\\, dx dy, from the even and odd parts to functions on the unit disk. These maps intertwine the actions of the metaplectic group given above and send zn to a multiple of wn. Stipulating that U¬± should be unitary determines the inner products on functions on the disk, which can expressed in the form above. Although in these representations the operator L0 has positive spectrum‚Äîthe feature that distinguishes the holomorphic discrete series representations of SU(1,1)‚Äîthe representations do not lie in the discrete series of the metaplectic group. Indeed, noted that the matrix coefficients are not square integrable, although their third power is. Harmonic oscillator and Hermite functions Consider the following subspace of L2(R): :\\\\mathcal{H} = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ f \\\\in L^2(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\left  f(x)=p(x)e^{-\\\\frac{x^2}{2}}, p(x) \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}[x] \\\\right. \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. The operators :\\\\begin{align} X &=Q-iP={d\\\\over dx} + x \\\\\\\\\\\\ Y &=Q+iP =-{d\\\\over dx} +x \\\\end{align} act on \\\\mathcal{H}. X is called the annihilation operator and Y the creation operator. They satisfy :\\\\begin{align} X &= Y^* \\\\\\\\\\\\ XY &= D +I && D=-{d^2\\\\over dx^2} + x^2\\\\\\\\\\\\ XY-YX &=2I \\\\\\\\\\\\ XY^n-Y^nX &=2n Y^{n-1} && \\\\text{by induction} \\\\end{align} Define the functions :F_n(x) = Y^n e^{-\\\\frac{x^2}{2}} We claim they are the eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator, D. To prove this we use the commutation relations above: :\\\\begin{align} DF_n &= D Y^nF_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= (XY-I)Y^n F_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\left ( XY^{n+1} -Y^n \\\\right) F_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\left ( \\\\left ((2n+2)Y^n + Y^{n+1}X \\\\right )-Y^n \\\\right) F_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\left ( (2n+1)Y^n + Y^{n+1}X \\\\right) F_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= (2n+1)Y^nF_0 + Y^{n+1}X F_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=(2n+1)F_n && XF_0 =0 \\\\end{align} Next we have: :\\\\F_n\\\\^2_2=2^n n!\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}. This is known for n = 0 and the commutation relation above yields :(F_n,F_n)= \\\\left (XY^n F_0,Y^{n-1}F_0 \\\\right )=2n (F_{n-1},F_{n-1}). The nth Hermite function is defined by :H_n(x)=\\\\F_n\\\\^{-1}F_n(x) =p_n(x) e^{-\\\\frac{x^2}{2}}. pn is called the nth Hermite polynomial. Let :\\\\begin{align} A &={1\\\\over\\\\sqrt{2}}Y={1\\\\over\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\left(-{d\\\\over dx} +x\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ A^* &={1\\\\over\\\\sqrt{2}}X={1\\\\over\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\left({d\\\\over dx} +x\\\\right) \\\\end{align} Thus :AA^*-A^*A=I. The operators P, Q or equivalently A, A* act irreducibly on \\\\mathcal H by a standard argument. Indeed, under the unitary isomorphism with holomorphic Fock space \\\\mathcal H can be identified with C[z], the space of polynomials in z, with :A= \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z},\\\\qquad A^*=z. If a subspace invariant under A and A* contains a non-zero polynomial p(z), then, applying a power of A*, it contains a non-zero constant; applying then a power of A, it contains all zn. Under the isomorphism Fn is sent to a multiple of zn and the operator D is given by :D=2A^*A+I. Let :L_0={1\\\\over 2}A^*A={1\\\\over 2} z{\\\\partial\\\\over\\\\partial z} so that :L_0z^n={n\\\\over 2}z^n. In the terminology of physics A, A* give a single boson and L0 is the energy operator. It is diagonalizable with eigenvalues 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, ...., each of multiplicity one. Such a representation is called a positive energy representation. Moreover, :[L_0,A]=-{1\\\\over 2}A, [L_0,A^*]={1\\\\over 2} A^*, so that the Lie bracket with L0 defines a derivation of the Lie algebra spanned by A, A* and I. Adjoining L0 gives the semidirect product. The infinitesimal version of the Stone‚Äìvon Neumann theorem states that the above representation on C[z] is the unique irreducible positive energy representation of this Lie algebra with L0 = A*A. For A lowers energy and A* raises energy. So any lowest energy vector v is annihilated by A and the module is exhausted by the powers of A* applied to v. It is thus a non-zero quotient of C[z] and hence can be identified with it by irreducibility. Let :L_{-1}={1\\\\over 2}A^2, L_{1}={1\\\\over 2} A^{*2}, so that :[L_{-1},A]=0,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, [L_{-1},A^*]=A,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, [L_1,A]=-A^*, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, [L_1,A^*]=0. These operators satisfy: :[L_m,L_n]=(m-n)L_{m+n} and act by derivations on the Lie algebra spanned by A, A* and I. They are the infinitesimal operators corresponding to the metaplectic representation of SU(1,1). The functions Fn are defined by :F_n(x)= \\\\left(x-{d\\\\over dx}\\\\right)^n e^{-\\\\frac{x^2}{2}} = (-1)^ne^{\\\\frac{x^2}{2}} {d^n\\\\over dx^n} \\\\left (e^{-x^2} \\\\right) = \\\\left (2^nx^n + \\\\cdots \\\\right )e^{-\\\\frac{x^2}{2}}. It follows that the Hermite functions are the orthonormal basis obtained by applying the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process to the basis xn exp -x2/2 of \\\\mathcal H. The completeness of the Hermite functions follows from the fact that the Bargmann transform is unitary and carries the orthonormal basis en(z) of holomorphic Fock space onto the Hn(x). The heat operator for the harmonic oscillator is the operator on L2(R) defined as the diagonal operator :e^{-Dt}H_n=e^{-(2n+1)t}H_n. It corresponds to the heat kernel given by Mehler's formula: :K_t(x,y)\\\\equiv\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} e^{-(2n+1)t}H_n(x)H_n(y)=(4\\\\pi t)^{-{1\\\\over 2}} \\\\left({2t\\\\over \\\\sinh 2t}\\\\right)^{1\\\\over 2} \\\\exp \\\\left(-{1\\\\over 4t} \\\\left[{2t\\\\over \\\\tanh 2t}(x^2+y^2) - {2t\\\\over \\\\sinh 2t}(2xy)\\\\right]\\\\right). This follows from the formula :\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} s^n H_n(x)H_n(y)= {1\\\\over \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi(1-s^2)}} \\\\exp {4xys - (1+s^2)(x^2+y^2)\\\\over 2(1-s^2)}. To prove this formula note that if s = œÉ2, then by Taylor's formula :F_{\\\\sigma,x}(z)\\\\equiv \\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} \\\\sigma^n e_n(z) H_n(x)= \\\\pi^{-{1\\\\over 4}} e^{-\\\\frac{x^2}{2}}\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} {(-z)^n \\\\sigma^n \\\\over 2^n n!}{d^n e^{x^2}\\\\over dx^n} = \\\\pi^{-\\\\frac{1}{4}} \\\\exp \\\\left (-{x^2\\\\over 2} +\\\\sqrt{2} xz\\\\sigma -{z^2\\\\sigma^2\\\\over 2} \\\\right ). Thus FœÉ,x lies in holomorphic Fock space and :\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} s^n H_n(x)H_n(y) = (F_{\\\\sigma,x},F_{\\\\sigma,y})_{\\\\mathcal F}, an inner product that can be computed directly. establishes Mehler's formula directly and uses a classical argument to prove that :\\\\int K_t(x,y)f(y)\\\\, dy tends to f in L2(R) as t decreases to 0. This shows the completeness of the Hermite functions and also, since :\\\\widehat{H_n}=(-i)^n H_n, can be used to derive the properties of the Fourier transform. There are other elementary methods for proving the completeness of the Hermite functions, for example using Fourier series. Sobolev spaces The Sobolev spaces Hs, sometimes called Hermite-Sobolev spaces, are defined to be the completions of \\\\mathcal S with respect to the norms :\\\\f\\\\_{(s)}^2 = \\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} a_n^2 (1+2n)^s, where :f=\\\\sum a_n H_n is the expansion of f in Hermite functions. Thus :\\\\f\\\\_{(s)}^2 = (D^s f,f), \\\\qquad (f_1,f_2)_{(s)}=(D^s f_1,f_2). The Sobolev spaces are Hilbert spaces. Moreover, Hs and H‚Äìs are in duality under the pairing :\\\\langle f_1, f_2\\\\rangle = \\\\int f_1f_2 \\\\, dx. For s ‚â• 0, :\\\\(aP +b Q)f\\\\_{(s)}\\\\le (a + b) C_s \\\\f\\\\_{\\\\left (s+{1\\\\over 2} \\\\right )} for some positive constant Cs. Indeed, such an inequality can be checked for creation and annihilation operators acting on Hermite functions Hn and this implies the general inequality. It follows for arbitrary s by duality. Consequently, for a quadratic polynomial R in P and Q :\\\\Rf\\\\_{(s)}\\\\le C'_s \\\\f\\\\_{(s+1)}. The Sobolev inequality holds for f in Hs with s > 1/2: :f(x)\\\\le C_{s,k} \\\\f\\\\_{(s+k)} (1+x^2)^{-k} for any k ‚â• 0. Indeed, the result for general k follows from the case k = 0 applied to Qkf. For k = 0 the Fourier inversion formula :f(x) = {1\\\\over \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\widehat{f}(t) e^{itx}\\\\, dt implies :f(x)\\\\le C \\\\left(\\\\int \\\\left \\\\widehat{f}(t) \\\\right ^2 (1+t^2)^s\\\\, dt\\\\right)^{1\\\\over 2}= C \\\\left ( \\\\left (I+Q^2 \\\\right )^s \\\\widehat{f}, \\\\widehat{f} \\\\right )^{1\\\\over 2}\\\\le C' \\\\left \\\\\\\\widehat{f} \\\\right \\\\_{(s)} =C' \\\\f\\\\_{(s)}. If s < t, the diagonal form of D, shows that the inclusion of Ht in Hs is compact (Rellich's lemma). It follows from Sobolev's inequality that the intersection of the spaces Hs is \\\\mathcal S. Functions in \\\\mathcal S are characterized by the rapid decay of their Hermite coefficients an. Standard arguments show that each Sobolev space is invariant under the operators W(z) and the metaplectic group. Indeed, it is enough to check invariance when g is sufficiently close to the identity. In that case :gDg^{-1}=D + A with D + A an isomorphism from H_{t+2} to H_t. It follows that :\\\\\\\\pi(g)f\\\\^2_{(s)} = \\\\left ((D+A)^sf,f) \\\\right  \\\\le \\\\left \\\\(D+A)^sf \\\\right \\\\_{(-s)}\\\\cdot\\\\f\\\\_{(s)} \\\\le C\\\\f\\\\_{(s)}^2. If f\\\\in H_s, then :{d\\\\over ds} U(s)f=iPU(s)f, \\\\qquad {d\\\\over dt}V(t) f=iQV(t)f, where the derivatives lie in H_{s-1/2}. Similarly the partial derivatives of total degree k of U(s)V(t)f lie in Sobolev spaces of order s‚Äìk/2. Consequently, a monomial in P and Q of order 2k applied to f lies in Hs‚Äìk and can be expressed as a linear combination of partial derivatives of U(s)V(t)f of degree ‚â§ 2k evaluated at 0. Smooth vectors The smooth vectors for the Weyl commutation relations are those u in L2(R) such that the map :\\\\Phi(z)=W(z)u is smooth. By the uniform boundedness theorem, this is equivalent to the requirement that each matrix coefficient (W(z)u,v) be smooth. A vector is smooth if and only it lies in \\\\mathcal S. Sufficiency is clear. For necessity, smoothness implies that the partial derivatives of W(z)u lie in L2(R) and hence also Dku for all positive k. Hence u lies in the intersection of the Hk, so in \\\\mathcal S. It follows that smooth vectors are also smooth for the metaplectic group. Moreover, a vector is in \\\\mathcal S if and only if it is a smooth vector for the rotation subgroup of SU(1,1). Analytic vectors If Œ†(t) is a one parameter unitary group and for f in \\\\mathcal S : \\\\Pi(f)=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(t)\\\\Pi(t)\\\\, dt, then the vectors Œ†(f)Œæ form a dense set of smooth vectors for Œ†. In fact taking : f_\\\\varepsilon(x)= {1\\\\over \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi \\\\varepsilon}} e^{-x^2/2\\\\varepsilon} the vectors v = Œ†(fŒµ)Œæ converge to Œæ as Œµ decreases to 0 and : \\\\Phi(t)=\\\\Pi(t)v is an analytic function of t that extends to an entire function on C. The vector is called an entire vector for Œ†. The wave operator associated to the harmonic oscillator is defined by : \\\\Pi(t) = e^{it\\\\sqrt{D}}. The operator is diagonal with the Hermite functions Hn as eigenfunctions: :\\\\Pi(t) H_n = e^{i(2n+1)^{1\\\\over 2} t} H_n. Since it commutes with D, it preserves the Sobolev spaces. The analytic vectors constructed above can be rewritten in terms of the Hermite semigroup as :v=e^{-\\\\varepsilon D}\\\\xi. The fact that v is an entire vector for Œ† is equivalent to the summability condition : \\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} {r^n \\\\D^{n \\\\over 2}v\\\\\\\\over n!} < \\\\infty for all r > 0. Any such vector is also an entire vector for U(s)V(t), that is the map :F(s,t)=U(s)V(t)v defined on R2 extends to an analytic map on C2. This reduces to the power series estimate :\\\\left\\\\\\\\sum_{m,n\\\\ge 0} {1\\\\over m! n!}z^m w^n P^m Q^n v\\\\right\\\\ \\\\le C \\\\sum_{k\\\\ge 0} {(z+w)^k \\\\over k!} \\\\D^{k\\\\over 2} v\\\\ <\\\\infty. So these form a dense set of entire vectors for U(s)V(t); this can also be checked directly using Mehler's formula. The spaces of smooth and entire vectors for U(s)V(t) are each by definition invariant under the action of the metaplectic group as well as the Hermite semigroup. Let : W(z,w)=e^{-izw/2} U(z)V(w) be the analytic continuation of the operators W(x,y) from R2 to C2 such that :e^{-izw/2}F(z,w)=W(z,w)v. Then W leaves the space of entire vectors invariant and satisfies :W(z_1,w_1)W(z_2,w_2)= e^{i(z_1w_2-w_1z_2)} W(z_1+z_2,w_1+w_2). Moreover, for g in SL(2,R) :\\\\pi(g) W(u)\\\\pi(g)^*=W(gu), using the natural action of SL(2,R) on C2. Formally :W(z,w)^*=W(-\\\\overline{z},-\\\\overline{w}). Oscillator semigroup There is a natural double cover of the Olshanski semigroup H, and its closure \\\\overline{H} that extends the double cover of SU(1,1) corresponding to the metaplectic group. It is given by pairs (g, Œ≥) where g is an element of H or its closure :g=\\\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & d\\\\end{pmatrix} and Œ≥ is a square root of a. Such a choice determines a unique branch of :\\\\left(-\\\\overline{b} z + \\\\overline{d}\\\\right)^{1\\\\over 2} for z < 1\\\\. The unitary operators œÄ(g) for g in SL(2,R) satisfy : \\\\pi(g) W(u) =W(g\\\\cdot u) \\\\pi(g), \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\pi(g)^*W(u) =W(g^{-1}\\\\cdot u)\\\\pi(g)^* for u in C2. An element g of the complexification SL(2,C) is said to implementable if there is a bounded operator T such that it and its adjoint leave the space of entire vectors for W invariant, both have dense images and satisfy the covariance relations : T W(u) =W(g\\\\cdot u) T, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, T^* W(u) =W(g^{\\\\dagger}\\\\cdot u)T^* for u in C2. The implementing operator T is uniquely determined up to multiplication by a non-zero scalar. The implementable elements form a semigroup, containing SL(2,R). Since the representation has positive energy, the bounded compact self-adjoint operators :S_0(t)=e^{-tL_0} for t > 0 implement the group elements in exp C1. It follows that all elements of the Olshanski semigroup and its closure are implemented. Maximality of the Olshanki semigroup implies that no other elements of SL(2,C) are implemented. Indeed, otherwise every element of SL(2,C) would be implemented by a bounded operator, which would condradict the non-invertibility of the operators S0(t) for t > 0. In the Schr√∂dinger representation the operators S0(t) for t > 0 are given by Mehler's formula. They are contraction operators, positive and in every Schatten class. Moreover, they leave invariant each of the Sobolev spaces. The same formula is true for \\\\Re\\\\, t > 0 by analytic continuation. It can be seen directly in the Fock model that the implementing operators can be chosen so that they define an ordinary representation of the double cover of H constructed above. The corresponding semigroup of contraction operators is called the oscillator semigroup. The extended oscillator semigroup is obtained by taking the semidirect product with the operators W(u). These operators lie in every Schatten class and leave invariant the Sobolev spaces and the space of entire vectors for W. The decomposition :\\\\overline{H} = G\\\\cdot \\\\exp \\\\overline{C} corresponds at the operator level to the polar decomposition of bounded operators. Moreover, since any matrix in H is conjugate to a diagonal matrix by elements in H or H‚àí1, every operator in the oscillator semigroup is quasi-similar to an operator S0(t) with \\\\Re t > 0. In particular it has the same spectrum consisting of simple eigenvalues. In the Fock model, if the element g of the Olshanki semigroup H corresponds to the matrix :\\\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & d\\\\end{pmatrix}, the corresponding operator is given by :\\\\pi(g,\\\\gamma)f(w) = {1\\\\over \\\\pi}\\\\iint_{\\\\mathbf C} K(w,\\\\overline{z}) f(z) e^{-z^2}\\\\,dxdy, where :K(w,z)=\\\\gamma^{-1} \\\\cdot \\\\exp\\\\,{1\\\\over 2a}(c z^2 + 2wz - b w^2) and Œ≥ is a square root of a. Operators œÄ(g,Œ≥) for g in the semigroup H are exactly those that are Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt operators and correspond to kernels of the form :K(w,z)=C\\\\cdot \\\\exp\\\\,{1\\\\over 2}(p z^2 + 2qwz + r w^2) for which the complex symmetric matrix :\\\\begin{pmatrix} p& q \\\\\\\\\\\\ q & r\\\\end{pmatrix} has operator norm strictly less than one. Operators in the extended oscillator semigroup are given by similar expressions with additional linear terms in z and w appearing in the exponential. In the disk model for the two irreducible components of the metaplectic representation, the corresponding operators are given by :\\\\pi_\\\\pm(g)F_\\\\pm(z)= (-\\\\overline{b} z + \\\\overline{d})^{-1\\\\pm 1/2} F_\\\\pm\\\\left({\\\\overline{a} z -\\\\overline{c}\\\\over -\\\\overline{b} z + \\\\overline{d}}\\\\right). It is also possible to give an explicit formula for the contraction operators corresponding to g in H in the Schr√∂dinger representation, It was by this formula that introduced the oscillator semigroup as an explicit family of operators on L2(R). In fact consider the Siegel upper half plane consisting of symmetric complex 2x2 matrices with positive definite real part: :Z=\\\\begin{pmatrix}A & B \\\\\\\\\\\\ B & D\\\\end{pmatrix} and define the kernel :K_Z(x,y)=e^{-(Ax^2 +2B xy +Dy^2)}. with corresponding operator :T_Zf(x)=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty K_Z(x,y)f(y)\\\\, dy for f in L2(R). Then direct computation gives :T_{Z_1}T_{Z_2}=(D_1+A_2)^{-1/2}T_{Z_3} where :Z_3=\\\\begin{pmatrix} A_1 -B_1^2(D_1+A_2)^{-1} &-B_1B_2(D_1+A_2)^{-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\B_1B_2(D_1+A_2)^{-1} & D_2 -B_2^2(D_1+A_2)^{-1}\\\\end{pmatrix}. Moreover, :T_Z^*= T_{Z^+} where :Z^+=\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\overline{D} & \\\\overline{B} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\overline{B} & \\\\overline{A}\\\\end{pmatrix}. By Mehler's formula for \\\\Re\\\\, t > 0 :e^{-t(P^2+Q^2)} = (\\\\mathrm{cosech}\\\\, 2t)^{1\\\\over 2}\\\\cdot T_{Z(t)} with :Z(t)=\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\coth 2t & -\\\\mathrm{ cosech}\\\\, 2t \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\mathrm{ cosech}\\\\, 2t & \\\\coth 2t\\\\end{pmatrix}. The oscillator semigroup is obtained by taking only matrices with B ‚â† 0. From the above, this condition is closed under composition. A normalized operator can be defined by :S_Z=B^{1\\\\over 2}\\\\cdot T_Z. The choice of a square root determines a double cover. In this case SZ corresponds to the element :g=\\\\begin{pmatrix} -DB^{-1} & DAB^{-1}-B \\\\\\\\\\\\ B^{-1} & -AB^{-1}\\\\end{pmatrix} of the Olshankii semigroup H. Moreover, SZ is a strict contraction: : \\\\S_Z\\\\<1. It follows also that :S_{Z_1} S_{Z_2} =\\\\pm S_{Z_3}. Weyl calculus For a function a(x,y) on R2 = C, let :\\\\psi(a)={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi}\\\\int\\\\widehat{a}(x,y) W(x,y)\\\\, dx dy. So :\\\\psi(a)f(x) =\\\\int K(x,y)f(y)\\\\, dy, where :K(x,y)=\\\\int a (t, {x+y\\\\over 2})e^{i(x-y)t}\\\\, dt. Defining in general : W(F)={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi} \\\\int F(z)W(z)\\\\,dxdy, the product of two such operators is given by the formula :W(F)W(G)=W(F\\\\star G), where the twisted convolution or Moyal product is given by :F\\\\star G(z)={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi} \\\\int F(z_1)G(z_2-z_1) e^{i(x_1y_2-y_1x_2)}\\\\, dx_1dy_1. The smoothing operators correspond to W(F) or œà(a) with F or a Schwartz functions on R2. The corresponding operators T have kernels that are Schwartz functions. They carry each Sobolev space into the Schwartz functions. Moreover, every bounded operator on L2 (R) having this property has this form. For the operators œà(a) the Moyal product translates into the Weyl symbolic calculus. Indeed, if the Fourier transforms of a and b have compact support than :\\\\psi(a)\\\\psi(b) =\\\\psi(a\\\\circ b), where :a\\\\circ b= \\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} {i^n\\\\over n!} \\\\left({\\\\partial^2\\\\over \\\\partial x_1\\\\partial y_2} -{\\\\partial^2\\\\over \\\\partial y_1\\\\partial x_2}\\\\right)^n a\\\\otimes b_{\\\\mathrm{diagonal}}. This follows because in this case b must extend to an entire function on C2 by the Paley- Wiener theorem. This calculus can be extended to a broad class of symbols, but the simplest corresponds to convolution by a class of functions or distributions that all have the form T + S where T is a distribution of compact with singular support concentrated at 0 and where S is a Schwartz function. This class contains the operators P, Q as well as D1/2 and D‚àí1/2 where D is the harmonic oscillator. The mth order symbols Sm are given by smooth functions a satisfying :\\\\partial^\\\\alpha a(z) \\\\le C_\\\\alpha (1+z)^{m-\\\\alpha} for all Œ± and Œ®m consists of all operators œà(a) for such a. If a is in Sm and œá is a smooth function of compact support equal to 1 near 0, then :\\\\widehat{a} =\\\\chi \\\\widehat{a} + (1-\\\\chi)\\\\widehat{a}=T+S, with T and S as above. These operators preserve the Schwartz functions and satisfy; :\\\\Psi^m\\\\cdot \\\\Psi^m \\\\subseteq \\\\Psi^{m+n},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, [\\\\Psi^m,\\\\Psi^n]\\\\subseteq \\\\Psi^{m+n-2}. The operators P and Q lie in Œ®1 and D lies in Œ®2. Properties: *A zeroth order symbol defines a bounded operator on L2(R). *D‚àí1 lies in Œ®‚àí2 *If R = R* is smoothing, then D + R has a complete set of eigenvectors fn in \\\\mathcal{S} with (D + R)fn = Œªnfn and Œªn tends to ‚âà as n tends to ‚âà. *D1/2 lies in Œ®1 and hence D‚àí1/2 lies in Œ®‚àí1, since D‚àí1/2 = D1/2 ¬∑D‚àí1 *Œ®‚àí1 consists of compact operators, Œ®‚àís consists of trace-class operators for s > 1 and Œ®k carries Hm into Hm‚Äìk. * \\\\mathrm{Tr}\\\\, \\\\psi(a) = \\\\int a The proof of boundedness of is particularly simple: if :T_{a,b} v=(v,b)a, then :T_{W(z)a,b}=e^{z^2/2} [W(z) T_{a,E_0}W(z)^{-1}T_{E_0,b}], where the bracketed operator has norm less than \\\\a\\\\\\\\cdot \\\\b\\\\. So if F is supported in z ‚â§ R, then :\\\\W(F)\\\\ \\\\le e^{R^2/2}\\\\\\\\widehat{F}\\\\_\\\\infty. The property of D‚àí1 is proved by taking :S=\\\\psi(a) with :a(z)={1\\\\over z^2 +1}. Then R = I ‚Äì DS lies in Œ®‚àí1, so that :A\\\\sim S + SR +SR^2 + \\\\cdots lies in Œ®‚àí2 and T = DA ‚Äì I is smoothing. Hence : D^{-1}= A - D^{-1}T lies in Œ®‚àí2 since D‚àí1 T is smoothing. The property for D1/2 is established similarly by constructing B in Œ®1/2 with real symbol such that D ‚Äì B4 is a smoothing operator. Using the holomorphic functional calculus it can be checked that D1/2 ‚Äì B2 is a smoothing operator. The boundedness result above was used by to establish the more general inequality of Alberto Calder√≥n and Remi Vaillancourt for pseudodifferential operators. An alternative proof that applies more generally to Fourier integral operators was given by . He showed that such operators can be expressed as integrals over the oscillator semigroup and then estimated using the Cotlar-Stein lemma. Applications and generalizations Theory for finite abelian groups noted that the formalism of the Stone‚Äìvon Neumann theorem and the oscillator representation of the symplectic group extends from the real numbers R to any locally compact abelian group. A particularly simple example is provided by finite abelian groups, where the proofs are either elementary or simplifications of the proofs for R. Let A be a finite abelian group, written additively, and let Q be a non-degenerate quadratic form on A with values in T. Thus :(a,b)=Q(a)Q(b)Q(a+b)^{-1} is a symmetric bilinear form on A that is non-degenerate, so permits an identification between A and its dual group A* = Hom (A, T). Let V=\\\\ell^2(A) be the space of complex-valued functions on A with inner product :(f,g)=\\\\sum_{x\\\\in A} f(x)\\\\overline{g(x)}. Define operators on V by :U(x) f(t)= f(t-x),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, V(y)f(t)=(y,t) f(t) for x, y in A. Then U(x) and V(y) are unitary representations of A on V satisfying the commutation relations :U(x)V(y)=(x,y) V(y) U(x). This action is irreducible and is the unique such irreducible representation of these relations. Let G = A √ó A and for z = (x, y) in G set :W(z)=U(x)V(y). Then :W(z_1)W(z_2)= B(z_1,z_2) W(z_2)W(z_1), where :B(z_1,z_2)=(x_1,y_2)(x_2,y_1)^{-1}, a non-degenerate alternating bilinear form on G. The uniqueness result above implies that if W'(z) is another family of unitaries giving a projective representation of G such that :W'(z_1)W'(z_2)= B(z_1,z_2) W'(z_2)W'(z_1), then there is a unitary U, unique up to a phase, such that :W'(z)=\\\\lambda(z) UW(z)U^*, for some Œª(z) in T. In particular if g is an automorphism of G preserving B, then there is an essentially unique unitary œÄ(g) such that :W(gz)=\\\\lambda_g(z)\\\\pi(g) W(z)\\\\pi(g)^*. The group of all such automorphisms is called the symplectic group for B and œÄ gives a projective representation of G on V. The group SL(2.Z) naturally acts on G = A x A by symplectic automorphisms. It is generated by the matrices :S=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 0\\\\end{pmatrix},\\\\qquad R=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1\\\\end{pmatrix}. If Z = ‚ÄìI, then Z is central and :{S^2=Z,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, (SR)^3 =Z,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, Z^2 =I.} These automorphisms of G are implemented on V by the following operators: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\pi(S)f(t) &= A^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\sum_{x\\\\in A} (-x,t)f(x) && \\\\text{the Fourier transform for } A \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\pi(Z)f(t) &= f(-t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\pi(R)f(t) &= Q(t)^{-1} f(t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} It follows that :(\\\\pi(S)\\\\pi(R))^3 =\\\\mu \\\\pi(Z), where Œº lies in T. Direct calculation shows that Œº is given by the Gauss sum :\\\\mu=A^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\sum_{x\\\\in A} Q(x). Transformation laws for theta functions The metaplectic group was defined as the group :\\\\operatorname{Mp}(2,\\\\mathbf R)= \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\left ( \\\\left. \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & d\\\\end{pmatrix},G \\\\right ) \\\\right  G(\\\\tau)^2=c\\\\tau +d, \\\\tau \\\\in \\\\mathbf{H} \\\\right \\\\\\\\}, The coherent state :f_\\\\tau(x) = e^{\\\\frac{1}{2}i\\\\tau x^2} defines a holomorphic map of H into L2(R) satisfying :\\\\pi((g^t)^{-1})f_\\\\tau= (c\\\\tau+d)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}f_{g\\\\tau}. This is in fact a holomorphic map into each Sobolev space Hk and hence also H_{\\\\approx} =\\\\mathcal{S}. On the other hand, in H_{-\\\\approx} = \\\\mathcal{S}' (in fact in H‚Äì1) there is a finite-dimensional space of distributions invariant under SL(2,Z) and isomorphic to the N-dimensional oscillator representation on \\\\ell^2(A) where A = Z/NZ. In fact let m > 0 and set N = 2m. Let :M=\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi m}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{Z}. The operators U(x), V(y) with x and y in M all commute and have a finite-dimensional subspace of fixed vectors formed by the distributions :\\\\Psi_{b}=\\\\sum_{x\\\\in M} \\\\delta_{x+b} with b in M1, where :M_1 ={1\\\\over 2m}M \\\\supset M. The sum defining Œ®b converges in H_{-1} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{S}' and depends only on the class of b in M1/M. On the other hand, the operators U(x) and V(y) with x, y in M1 commute with all the corresponding operators for M. So M1 leaves the subspace V0 spanned by the Œ®b invariant. Hence the group A = M1 acts on V0. This action can immediately be identified with the action on V for the N-dimensional oscillator representation associated with A, since :U(b)\\\\Psi_{b'} =\\\\Psi_{b+b'},\\\\qquad V(b)\\\\Psi_{b'}=e^{-imbb'} \\\\Psi_{b'}. Since the operators œÄ(R) and œÄ(S) normalise the two sets of operators U and V corresponding to M and M1, it follows that they leave V0 invariant and on V0 must be constant multiples of the operators associated with the oscillator representation of A. In fact they coincide. From R this is immediate from the definitions, which show that :R(\\\\Psi_b) = e^{\\\\pi imb^2} \\\\Psi_b. For S it follows from the Poisson summation formula and the commutation properties with the operators U)x) and V(y). The Poisson summation is proved classically as follows. For a > 0 and f in \\\\mathcal{S} let :F(t)=\\\\sum_{x\\\\in M} f(x+t). F is a smooth function on R with period a: :F(t+a)=F(t). The theory of Fourier series shows that :F(0)= \\\\sum_{n\\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z}} c_n with the sum absolutely convergent and the Fourier coefficients given by :c_n = a^{-1} \\\\int_0^a F(t) e^{-\\\\frac{2\\\\pi int}{a}}\\\\, dt= a^{-1} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(t) e^{-\\\\frac{2\\\\pi int}{a}}\\\\, dt={\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\over a} \\\\widehat{f} \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{2\\\\pi n}{a} \\\\right). Hence :\\\\sum_{n\\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z}} f(na)= \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}{a} \\\\sum_{n\\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z}} \\\\widehat{f} \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{2\\\\pi n}{a} \\\\right ), the usual Poisson summation formula. This formula shows that S acts as follows :S(\\\\Psi_b)=(2m)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\sum_{b'\\\\in M_1/M} e^{- i m bb'} \\\\Psi_{b'}, and so agrees exactly with formula for the oscillator representation on A. Identifying A with Z/2mZ, with :b(n)=\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi} n}{2m} assigned to an integer n modulo 2m, the theta functions can be defined directly as matrix coefficients:See:  * :\\\\Theta_{m,n}(\\\\tau,z)=(W(z)f_\\\\tau,\\\\Psi_{b(n)}). For œÑ in H and z in C set :q=e^{2\\\\pi i \\\\tau},\\\\qquad u=e^{\\\\pi iz} so that q < 1\\\\. The theta functions agree with the standard classical formulas for the Jacobi-Riemann theta functions: :\\\\Theta_{n,m} (\\\\tau,z) = \\\\sum_{k\\\\in \\\\frac{n}{2m} + \\\\mathbf{Z}} q^{mk^2} u^{2mk}. By definition they define holomorphic functions on H √ó C. The covariance properties of the function fœÑ and the distribution Œ®b lead immediately to the following transformation laws: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Theta_{n,m}(\\\\tau, z + a) &= \\\\Theta_{n,m}(\\\\tau,z) && a \\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Theta_{n,m}(\\\\tau, z+b\\\\tau) &= q^{-b^2} u^{-b}\\\\Theta_{n,m}(\\\\tau,z) && b \\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Theta_{n,m}(\\\\tau + 1, z) &= e^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi i n^2}{m}} \\\\Theta_{n,m}(\\\\tau,z) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Theta_{n,m}(-\\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\tau},\\\\tfrac{z}{\\\\tau}) &= \\\\tau^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}e^{-\\\\frac{i\\\\pi}{8}} (2m)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\sum_{n'\\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z}/2m\\\\mathbf{Z}} e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\pi inn'}{m}} \\\\Theta_{n',m}(\\\\tau,z) \\\\end{align} Derivation of law of quadratic reciprocity Because the operators œÄ(S), œÄ (R) and œÄ(J) on L2(R) restrict to the corresponding operators on V0 for any choice of m, signs of cocycles can be determined by taking m = 1. In this case the representation is 2-dimensional and the relation :{(\\\\pi(S)\\\\pi(R))^3 =\\\\pi(J)} on L2(R) can be checked directly on V0. But in this case :\\\\mu= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\left (e^{\\\\frac{i\\\\pi}{4}} +e^{-\\\\frac{i\\\\pi}{4}} \\\\right )=1. The relation can also be checked directly by applying both sides to the ground state exp -x2/2. Consequently, it follows that for m ‚â• 1 the Gauss sum can be evaluated: :\\\\sum_{x\\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z}/2m\\\\mathbf{Z}} e^{\\\\pi i x^2/2m} = \\\\sqrt{m}(1+i). For m odd, define :{G(c,m)=\\\\sum_{x\\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z}/m\\\\mathbf{Z}} e^{2\\\\pi i c x^2/m}.} If m is odd, then, splitting the previous sum up into two parts, it follows that G(1,m) equals m1/2 if m is congruent to 1 mod 4 and equals i m1/2 otherwise. If p is an odd prime and c is not divisible by p, this implies :{G(c,p)= \\\\left({c\\\\over p}\\\\right)G(1,p)} where \\\\left({c\\\\over p}\\\\right) is the Legendre symbol equal to 1 if c is a square mod p and ‚Äì1 otherwise. Moreover, if p and q are distinct odd primes, then :{G(1,pq)/G(1,p)G(1,q) = \\\\left({p\\\\over q}\\\\right)\\\\left({q\\\\over p}\\\\right)}. From the formula for G(1,p) and this relation, the law of quadratic reciprocity follows: :{\\\\left({p\\\\over q}\\\\right)\\\\left({q\\\\over p}\\\\right) = (-1)^{\\\\frac{(p-1)(q-1)}{4}}.} Theory in higher dimensions The theory of the oscillator representation can be extended from R to Rn with the group SL(2,R) replaced by the symplectic group Sp(2n,R). The results can be proved either by straightforward generalisations from the one-dimensional case as in or by using the fact that the n-dimensional case is a tensor product of n one-dimensional cases, reflecting the decomposition: :L^2({\\\\mathbf R}^n)=L^2({\\\\mathbf R})^{\\\\otimes n}. Let \\\\mathcal S be the space of Schwartz functions on Rn, a dense subspace of L2(Rn). For s, t in Rn, define U(s) and V(t) on \\\\mathcal S and L2(R) by :U(s)f(x)= f(x-s),\\\\qquad V(t)f(tx)=e^{ix\\\\cdot t} f(x). From the definition U and V satisfy the Weyl commutation relation :U(s)V(t)=e^{-is\\\\cdot t}V(t)U(s). As before this is called the Schr√∂dinger representation. The Fourier transform is defined on \\\\mathcal S by :{\\\\widehat{f}(t)= {1\\\\over (2\\\\pi)^{n/2}} \\\\int_{{\\\\mathbf R}^n} f(x) e^{-ix\\\\cdot t} \\\\, dx.} The Fourier inversion formula : {f(x) ={1\\\\over (2\\\\pi)^{n/2}}\\\\int_{{\\\\mathbf R}^n} \\\\widehat{f}(t)e^{ix\\\\cdot t}\\\\, dt} shows that the Fourier transform is an isomorphism of \\\\mathcal S onto itself extending to a unitary mapping of L2(Rn) onto itself (Plancherel's theorem). The Stone‚Äìvon Neumann theorem asserts that the Schr√∂dinger representation is irreducible and is the unique irreducible representation of the commutation relations: any other representation is a direct sum of copies of this representation. If U and V satisfying the Weyl commutation relations, define :{ W(x,y)=e^{ix\\\\cdot y/2}U(x)V(y).} Then :{W(x_1,y_1)W(x_2,y_2)=e^{i(x_1\\\\cdot y_2-y_1\\\\cdot x_2)} W(x_1+x_2,y_1+y_2),} so that W defines a projective unitary representation of R2n with cocycle given by :\\\\omega(z_1,z_2) = e^{iB(z_1,z_2)}, where z=x+iy=(x,y) and B is the symplectic form on R2n given by :B(z_1,z_2)=x_1\\\\cdot y_2-y_1\\\\cdot x_2=\\\\Im\\\\, z_1\\\\cdot\\\\overline {z_2}. The symplectic group Sp (2n,R) is defined to be group of automorphisms g of R2n preserving the form B. It follows from the Stone‚Äìvon Neumann theorem that for each such g there is a unitary œÄ(g) on L2(R) satisfying the covariance relation :\\\\pi(g) W(z) \\\\pi(g)^* = W(g(z)). By Schur's lemma the unitary œÄ(g) is unique up to multiplication by a scalar Œ∂ with Œ∂ = 1, so that œÄ defines a projective unitary representation of Sp(n). Representatives can be chosen for œÄ(g), unique up to a sign, which show that the 2-cocycle for the projective representation of Sp(2n,R) takes values ¬±1. In fact elements of the group Sp(n,R) are given by 2n √ó 2n real matrices g satisfying :{gJg^t=J,} where :{J=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -I \\\\\\\\\\\\ I & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}.} Sp(2n,R) is generated by matrices of the form :g_1=\\\\begin{pmatrix} A & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & (A^t)^{-1} \\\\end{pmatrix},\\\\,\\\\, g_2=\\\\begin{pmatrix} I & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ B& I\\\\end{pmatrix},\\\\,\\\\, g_3=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & I\\\\\\\\\\\\ -I & 0\\\\end{pmatrix}, and the operators :{\\\\pi(g_1)f(x)=\\\\pm \\\\det (A)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} f(A^{-1}x),\\\\,\\\\, \\\\pi(g_2)f(x) =\\\\pm e^{-ix^tBx} f(x),\\\\,\\\\, \\\\pi(g_3)f(x)=\\\\pm e^{in\\\\pi/8} \\\\widehat{f}(x)} satisfy the covariance relations above. This gives an ordinary unitary representation of the metaplectic group, a double cover of Sp(2n,R). Indeed, Sp(n,R) acts by M√∂bius transformations on the generalised Siegel upper half plane Hn consisting of symmetric complex n √ó n matrices Z with strictly imaginary part by :{gZ=(AZ+B)(CZ+D)^{-1}} if :{g=\\\\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\\\\\\\\\ C & D\\\\end{pmatrix}.} The function : {m(g,z)=\\\\det (CZ+D)} satisfies the 1-cocycle relation :{m(gh,Z)=m(g,hZ)m(h,Z).} The metaplectic group Mp(2n,R) is defined as the group :{Mp(2,\\\\mathbf R)=\\\\\\\\{(g,G): \\\\,G(Z)^2=m(g,Z)\\\\\\\\}} and is a connected double covering group of Sp(2n,R). If \\\\Im Z > 0, then it defines a coherent state :{f_z(x) = e^{ix^tZx/2}} in L2, lying in a single orbit of Sp(2n) generated by :{f_{iI}(x) = e^{-x\\\\cdot x/2}.} If g lies in Mp(2n,R) then :{ \\\\pi((g^t)^{-1})f_Z(x)= m(g,Z)^{-1/2}f_{gZ}(x)} defines an ordinary unitary representation of the metaplectic group, from which it follows that the cocycle on Sp(2n,R) takes only values ¬±1. Holomorphic Fock space is the Hilbert space \\\\mathcal{F}_n of holomorphic functions f(z) on Cn with finite norm :{{1\\\\over \\\\pi^n} \\\\int_{{\\\\mathbf C}^n} f(z)^2 e^{-z^2} \\\\, dx\\\\cdot dy} inner product :{(f_1,f_2)= {1\\\\over \\\\pi^n} \\\\int_{{\\\\mathbf C}^n} f_1(z)\\\\overline{f_2(z)} e^{-z^2} \\\\, dx\\\\cdot dy.} and orthonormal basis :{e_\\\\alpha(z)={z^\\\\alpha\\\\over \\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha!}}} for Œ± a multinomial. For f in {\\\\mathcal F}_n and z in Cn, the operators :{ W_{{\\\\mathcal F}_n}(z)f(w)=e^{-z^2} e^{w\\\\overline{z}} f(w-z).} define an irreducible unitary representation of the Weyl commutation relations. By the Stone‚Äìvon Neumann theorem there is a unitary operator \\\\mathcal U from L2(Rn) onto \\\\mathcal{F}_n intertwining the two representations. It is given by the Bargmann transform :{\\\\mathcal{U}f(z) ={1\\\\over (2\\\\pi)^{n/2}}\\\\int B(z,t) f(t)\\\\, dt,} where :B(z,t)= \\\\exp [-z\\\\cdot z -t\\\\cdot t/2 +z\\\\cdot t]. Its adjoint {\\\\mathcal U}^* is given by the formula: :{\\\\mathcal{U}^*F(t)={1\\\\over \\\\pi^n} \\\\int_{{\\\\mathbf C}^n} B(\\\\overline{z},t) F(z)\\\\, dx\\\\cdot dy.} Sobolev spaces, smooth and analytic vectors can be defined as in the one-dimensional case using the sum of n copies of the harmonic oscillator :\\\\Delta_n=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n -{\\\\partial^2\\\\over \\\\partial x_i^2} + x_i^2. The Weyl calculus similarly extends to the n-dimensional case. The complexification Sp(2n,C) of the symplectic group is defined by the same relation, but allowing the matrices A, B, C and D to be complex. The subsemigroup of group elements that take the Siegel upper half plane into itself has a natural double cover. The representations of Mp(2n,R) on L2(Rn) and \\\\mathcal{F}_n extend naturally to a representation of this semigroup by contraction operators defined by kernels, which generalise the one-dimensional case (taking determinants where necessary). The action of Mp(2n,R) on coherent states applies equally well to operators in this larger semigroup. As in the 1-dimensional case, where the group SL(2,R) has a counterpart SU(1,1) threough the Cayley transform with the upper half plane replaced by the unit disc, the symplectic group has a complex counterpart. Indeed, if C is the unitary matrix :{C={1\\\\over \\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\begin{pmatrix} I & i I \\\\\\\\\\\\ I & -iI \\\\end{pmatrix}} then C Sp(2n) C‚àí1 is the group of all matrices :{g=\\\\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\overline{B} & \\\\overline{A}\\\\end{pmatrix}} such that :{AA^* - BB^*=I,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, AB^t=BA^t;} or equivalently :gKg^*=K, where :{K=\\\\begin{pmatrix} I & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -I \\\\end{pmatrix}.} The Siegel generalized disk Dn is defined as the set of complex symmetric n x n matrices W with operator norm less than 1. It consist precisely of Cayley transforms of points Z in the Siegel generalized upper half plane: :{W=(Z-iI)(Z+iI)^{-1}.} Elements g act on Dn : {gW=(AW+B)(\\\\overline{B}W +\\\\overline{A})^{-1}} and, as in the one dimensional case this action is transitive. The stabilizer subgroup of 0 consists of matrices with A unitary and B = 0. For W in Dn the metaplectic coherent states in holomorphic Fock space are defined by :{f_W(z)=e^{z^tWz/2}.} The inner product of two such states is given by :{(f_{W_1},f_{W_2})=\\\\det (1-W_1\\\\overline{W_2})^{-1/2}.} Moreover, the metaplectic representation œÄ satisfies :{\\\\pi(g)f_W= \\\\det (\\\\overline{A} +\\\\overline{B}W)^{-1/2} f_{gW}.} The closed linear span of these states gives the even part of holomorphic Fock space \\\\mathcal{F}_n^+. The embedding of Sp(2n) in Sp(2(n+1)) and the compatible identification :\\\\mathcal{F}_{n+1}^+ = \\\\mathcal{F}_n^+ \\\\oplus \\\\mathcal{F}_n^- lead to an action on the whole of \\\\mathcal{F}_n. It can be verified directly that it is compatible with the action of the operators W(z). Since the complex semigroup has as Shilov boundary the symplectic group, the fact that this representation has a well- defined contractive extension to the semigroup follows from the maximum modulus principle and the fact that the semigroup operators are closed under adjoints. Indeed, it suffices to check, for two such operators S, T and vectors vi proportional to metaplectic coherent states, that : \\\\left\\\\sum_{i,j}(STv_i,v_j)\\\\right \\\\le \\\\\\\\sum_i v_i\\\\^2, which follows because the sum depends holomorphically on S and T, which are unitary on the boundary. Index theorems for Toeplitz operators Let S denote the unit sphere in Cn and define the Hardy space H2(S) be the closure in L2(S) of the restriction of polynomials in the coordinates z1, ..., zn. Let P be the projection onto Hardy space. It is known that if m(f) denotes multiplication by a continuous function f on S, then the commutator [P,m(f)] is compact. Consequently, defining the Toeplitz operator by :{T(f)=Pm(f)P} on Hardy space, it follows that T(fg) ‚Äì T(f)T(g) is compact for continuous f and g. The same holds if f and g are matrix-valued functions (so that the corresponding Toeplitz operators are matrices of operators on H2(S)). In particular if f is a function on S taking values in invertible matrices, then : {T(f)T(f^{-1}) -I,\\\\qquad T(f^{-1})T(f) -I} are compact and hence T(f) is a Fredholm operator with an index defined as :\\\\operatorname{ind} T(f)= \\\\dim \\\\ker T(f) - \\\\dim \\\\ker T(f)^*. The index has been computed using the methods of K-theory by and coincides up to a sign with the degree of f as a continuous mapping from S into the general linear group. gave an analytic way to establish this index theorem, simplied later by Howe. Their proof relies on the fact if f is smooth then the index is given by the formula of McKean and Singer: :\\\\operatorname{ind} T(f) = \\\\operatorname{Tr} (I-T(f^{-1})T(f))^n - \\\\operatorname{Tr} (I-T(f)T(f^{-1}))^n. noticed that there was a natural unitary isomorphism between H2(S) and L2(Rn) carrying the Toeplitz operators :{T_j=T(z_j)} onto the operators :{(P_j+iQ_j)\\\\Delta^{-1/2}.} These are examples of zeroth order operators constructed within the Weyl calculus. The traces in the McKean-Singer formula can be computed directly using the Weyl calculus, leading to another proof of the index theorem.See: , Chapter XIX This method of proving index theorems was generalised by Alain Connes within the framework of cyclic cohomology. Theory in infinite dimensions The theory of the oscillator representation in infinite dimensions is due to Irving Segal and David Shale.See:  Graeme Segal used it to give a mathematically rigorous construction of projective representations of loop groups and the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle. At an infinitesimal level the construction of the representations of the Lie algebras, in this case the affine Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra and the Virasoro algebra, was already known to physicists, through dual resonance theory and later string theory. Only the simplest case will be considered here, involving the loop group LU(1) of smooth maps of the circle into U(1) = T. The oscillator semigroup, developed independently by Neretin and Segal, allows contraction operators to be defined for the semigroup of univalent holomorphic maps of the unit disc into itself, extending the unitary operators corresponding to diffeomorphisms of the circle. When applied to the subgroup SU(1,1) of the diffeomorphism group, this gives a generalization of the oscillator representation on L2(R) and its extension to the Olshanskii semigroup. The representation of commutation on Fock space is generalized to infinite dimensions by replacing Cn (or its dual space) by an arbitrary complex Hilbert space H. The symmetric group Sk acts on H‚äók. Sk(H) is defined to be the fixed point subspace of Sk and the symmetric algebra is the algebraic direct sum :{\\\\bigoplus_{k\\\\ge 0} S^k(H).} It has a natural inner product inherited from H‚äók: :{(x_1\\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes x_k,y_1\\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes y_k) =k!\\\\cdot \\\\prod_{i=1}^k (x_i,y_i).} Taking the components Sk(H) to be mutually orthogonal, the symmetric Fock space S(H) is defined to be the Hilbert space completion of this direct sum. For Œæ in H define the coherent state eŒæ by :{e^\\\\xi=\\\\sum_{k\\\\ge 0} (k!)^{-1} \\\\xi^{\\\\otimes k}.} It follows that their linear span is dense in S(H), that the coherent states corresponding to n distinct vectors are linearly independent and that : {(e^\\\\xi,e^\\\\eta)=e^{(\\\\xi,\\\\eta)}.} When H is finite-dimensional, S(H) can naturally be identified with holomorphic Fock space for H*, since in the standard way Sk(H) are just homogeneous polynomials of degree k on H* and the inner products match up. Moreover, S(H) has functorial properties. Most importantly :S(H_1\\\\oplus H_2)=S(H_1)\\\\otimes S(H_2),\\\\qquad e^{x_1\\\\oplus x_2}=e^{x_1}\\\\otimes e^{x_2}. A similar result hold for finite orthogonal direct sums and extends to infinite orthogonal direct sums, using von Neumman's definition of the infinite tensor product with 1 the reference unit vector in S0(Hi). Any contraction operator between Hilbert spaces induces a contraction operator between the corresponding symmetric Fock spaces in a functorial way. A unitary operator on S(H) is uniquely determined by it values on coherent states. Moreover, for any assignment vŒæ such that :{(v_\\\\xi,v_\\\\eta) = e^{(\\\\xi,\\\\eta)}} there is a unique unitary operator U on S(H) such that :{v_\\\\xi= U(e^\\\\xi).} As in the finite-dimensional case, this allows the unitary operators W(x) to be defined for x in H: :{W(x)e^{y} = e^{-\\\\x\\\\^2/2} e^{-(x,y)} e^{x+y}.} It follows immediately from the finite-dimensional case that these operators are unitary and satisfy :{W(x)W(y)=e^{-{i\\\\over 2} \\\\Im (x,y)} W(x+y).} In particular the Weyl commutation relations are satisfied: :{W(x)W(y)=e^{-i \\\\Im (x,y)}W(y)W(x).} Taking an orthonormal basis en of H, S(H) can be written as an infinite tensor product of the S(C en). The irreducibility of W on each of these spaces implies the irreducibility of W on the whole of S(H). W is called the complex wave representation. To define the symplectic group in infinite dimensions let HR be the underlying real vector space of H with the symplectic form :{B(x,y) =-\\\\Im (x,y)} and real inner product :{(x,y)_{\\\\mathbf{R}} =\\\\Re (x,y).} The complex structure is then defined by the orthogonal operator :{J(x)=ix} so that :{B(x,y)=-(Jx,y)_{\\\\mathbf{R}}.} A bounded invertible operator real linear operator T on HR lies in the symplectic group if it and its inverse preserve B. This is equivalent to the conditions: :{TJT^t=J=T^t JT.} The operator T is said to be implementable on S(H) provided there is a unitary œÄ(T) such that :\\\\pi(T) W(x) \\\\pi(T)^*= W(Tx). The implementable operators form a subgroup of the symplectic group, the restricted symplectic group. By Schur's lemma, œÄ(T) is uniquely determined up to a scalar in T, so œÄ gives a projective unitary representation of this subgroup. The Segal-Shale quantization criterion states that T is implementable, i.e. lies in the restricted symplectic group, if and only if the commutator TJ ‚Äì JT is a Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt operator. Unlike the finite-dimensional case where a lifting œÄ could be chosen so that it was multiplicative up to a sign, this is not possible in the infinite-dimensional case. (This can be seen directly using the example of the projective representation of the diffeomorphism group of the circle constructed below.) The projective representation of the restricted symplectic group can be constructed directly on coherent states as in the finite-dimensional case. In fact, choosing a real Hilbert subspace of H of which H is a complexification, for any operator T on H a complex conjugate of T is also defined. Then the infinite-dimensional analogue of SU(1,1) consists of invertible bounded operators :{g=\\\\begin{pmatrix} A & B\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\overline{B} &\\\\overline{A}\\\\end{pmatrix}} satisfying gKg* = K (or equivalently the same relations as in the finite-dimensional case). These belong to the restricted symplectic group if and only if B is a Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt operator. This group acts transitively on the infinite-dimensional analogue D‚âà of the Seigel generalized unit disk consisting of Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt operators W that are symmetric with operator norm less than 1 via the formula :{gZ=(AW+B)(\\\\overline{B}W+\\\\overline{A})^{-1}.} Again the stsblilizer subgroup of 0 consists of g with A unitary and B = 0. The metaplectic coherent states fW can be defined as before and their inner product is given by the same formula, using the Fredholm determinant: :{(f_{W_1},f_{W_2})=\\\\det (I-W_2^*W_1)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}.} Define unit vectors by :{e_W=\\\\det (I-W^*W)^{1/4} f_W} and set :{\\\\pi(g)e_W= \\\\mu(\\\\det(I+\\\\overline{A}^{-1} \\\\overline{B}W)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}) e_{gW},} where Œº(Œ∂) = Œ∂/Œ∂. As before this defines a projective representation and, if g3 = g1g2, the cocycle is given by :{\\\\omega(g_1,g_2)=\\\\mu[\\\\det (A_3(A_1A_2)^{-1})^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}].} This representation extends by analytic continuation to define contraction operators for the complex semigroup by the same analytic continuation argument as in the finite-dimensional case. It can also be shown that they are strict contractions. Example Let HR be the real Hilbert space consisting of real- valued functions on the circle with mean 0 :f(\\\\theta)=\\\\sum_{n e 0} a_n e^{in\\\\theta} and for which :{\\\\sum_{n e 0} na_n^2 < \\\\infty.} The inner product is given by :\\\\left (\\\\sum a_n e^{in\\\\theta}, \\\\sum b_m e^{im\\\\theta} \\\\right )=\\\\sum_{n e 0} n a_n\\\\overline{b_n}. An orthogonal basis is given by the function sin(nŒ∏) and cos(nŒ∏) for n > 0. The Hilbert transform on the circle defined by :J\\\\sin (n\\\\theta) = \\\\cos(n\\\\theta),\\\\qquad J \\\\cos (n\\\\theta) =-\\\\sin(n\\\\theta) defines a complex structure on HR. J can also be written :J\\\\sum_{n e 0} a_ne^{in\\\\theta} =\\\\sum_{n e 0} i \\\\operatorname{sign}(n) a_n e^{in\\\\theta}, where sign n = ¬±1 denotes the sign of n. The corresponding symplectic form is proportional to :B(f,g)=\\\\int_{S^1} f dg. In particular if œÜ is an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of the circle and :{T_\\\\varphi f(\\\\theta)= f(\\\\varphi^{-1}(\\\\theta)) -{1\\\\over 2\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} f(\\\\varphi^{-1}(\\\\theta))\\\\, d\\\\theta ,} then TœÜ is implementable.See:  The operators W(f) with f smooth correspond to a subgroup of the loop group LT invariant under the diffeomorphism group of the circle. The infinitesimal operators corresponding to the vector fields :{L_n=-\\\\pi\\\\left(i e^{in\\\\theta}{d\\\\over d\\\\theta}\\\\right)} can be computed explicitly. They satisfy the Virasoro relations :{[L_m,L_n]=(m-n)L_{m+n} + {m^3-m\\\\over 12} \\\\delta_{m+n,0}.} In particular they cannor be adjusted by addition of scalar operators to remove the second term on the right hand side. This shows that the cocycle on the restricted symplectic group is not equivalent to one taking only the values ¬±1.

As a spokesperson of the groups, Ehsan would use media campaigns, social media networks and call up local journalists to claim responsibility for terrorist attacks on behalf of the groups. He was initially a spokesman for the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). In 2014, he left TTP after he had developed ideological differences with the TTP leadership following the appointment of Fazlullah as the leader of the group. He later co-founded Jamaat-ul-Ahrar and became its spokesman. In 2015, as a spokesman of Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, he condemned Fazlullah-led Tehrik-e- Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar. In April 2017, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director-General Asif Ghafoor announced that Ehsan had surrendered himself to Pakistan's security agencies. However, ISPR's claim was disputed by Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, who said that Ehansullah Ehsan was captured by Pakistan security agencies from Paktika province of Afghanistan. While Ehsan was in the custody of Pakistani security forces, several high ranking TTP members like Qari Saifullah Mehsud, Sheikh Khalid Haqqani and Qari Saif Younis were assassinated in Afghanistan. TTP members believe that the Pakistani intelligence agencies were responsible for the killings. Several anti- terrorist operations were also conducted by Pakistani security forces in Pakistan based on the information provided by Ehsan. In early February 2020, Ehsanullah claimed that he has escaped from the custody of Pakistani Agencies. Militant activity In December 2011, Ehsanullah disputed that the Pakistani Taliban was negotiating a cease-fire with the Pakistani government. He asserted that the individuals negotiating that cease-fire were doing so without the authorization of the Taliban's leadership. He was sacked on 25 June 2013. In April 2017, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director- General Asif Ghafoor announced that Ehsan had surrendered himself to Pakistan's security agencies. However, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar disputed ISPR's claim. Jamaat-ul-Ahrar said that Ehansullah Ehsan did not surrender, rather he was captured by Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI) from Paktika province of Afghanistan. The group further stated that Ehsan was captured on 7 March by Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI) and was later handed over to the Pakistan army. Paktika province of Afghanistan is known as safe heaven for multiple terrorist groups. In February 2020, Ehsanullah Ehsan managed to escape from the custody of Pakistani security forces. According to Pakistani officials, the ex-TTP spokesperson had shared extremely sensitive and important information while in custody, which led the security forces to smash the local and international networks of the TTP and Jamaat-ul-Ahrar. Several terrorists from the outlawed groups were arrested based on his leads. Pakistani officials said that \\"Ehsan would be brought to justice, but first it was necessary to extract information from him to take the anti-terrorism operations to a logical conclusion.\\" According to Pakistani officials, Ehsan managed to escape during an anti-terrorist operation. Responsibility for attacks Some of the attacks for which Ehsan claimed responsibility as a TTP and Jamaat-ul-Ahrar spokesman are: * On 9 October 2012, Ehsan claimed responsibility for the Taliban shooting in the head of a 15-year-old Pakistani activist, Malala Yousafzai, a girl who was famous for highlighting Taliban atrocities. He said that the teenager's work had been an \\"obscenity\\" that needed to be stopped: \\"This was a new chapter of obscenity, and we have to finish this chapter.\\" On 15 October, Pakistani interior minister, Rehman Malik, offered a $1 million bounty for Ehsan. * On 22 November 2012, Ehsan claimed Taliban responsibility for suicide bombings carried out the day before against Shiites in Rawalpindi and Karachi. As justification for the attacks, he stated that \\"the Shiite community is engaged in defiling the Prophet.\\" He also asserted that his group's activities would continue \\"irrespective of security measures taken by Rehman Malik.\\" * On 15 December 2012, Ehsan confirmed Taliban involvement in a rocket attack on Bacha Khan International Airport that killed 4 people and wounded 35. He noted that the attack's intended target was actually an adjacent airbase, and claimed that the Taliban \\"have planned more attacks on Pakistani forces and its installation as it works to please the USA\\". * On 23 June 2013, Ehsan claimed responsibility for the killing of nine foreign tourists and their guide in Gilgit-Balitistan. * On 2 November 2014, Ehsan claimed responsibility for the 2014 Wagah border suicide attack. \\"Some other groups have claimed responsibility of this attack, but these claims are baseless.

Early and personal life Skeef was born during the apartheid regime in South Africa to Sipho Mabuse and her mother, Mary Edwards. Her first name is a SeSotho word meaning \\"gift\\". Mpho spent her first birthday imprisoned in Caledon Square, Cape Town with her mother who was an anti-apartheid campaigner.Daily Record ‚Äì Rising star MPHO could be Britain's answer to Beyonce 25 June 2009 By Bev Lyons She moved to the United Kingdom at the age of four and was brought up in Stockwell, Clapham and Brixton by her mother and her stepfather, Eugene Skeef. She attended the BRIT School in Croydon. Career Mpho began working in the music industry in 2004, initially as a backing vocalist for artists such as Ms Dynamite, Natasha Bedingfield, Ty, Terri Walker, Skinnyman, Rodney P, and Spacek. She was a lead vocalist on the Bugz in the Attic single \\"Booty La La\\", which reached number 44 on the UK Singles Chart. She signed to the Arts Council-funded record label Documented Records and, in 2005, released her debut single, \\"Comin' for Ya\\", and the four-track EP Don't Like You. By late 2006, Mpho had joined PIAS Recordings/Wall of Sound on the strength of Don't Like You, and was preparing an electro-influenced album titled To Spite My Face with producers including Spacek, dBridge, and Yan Murawski. She also sang on the track \\"This Island Earth\\" on Coldcut's 2006 album Sound Mirrors, and released a second solo single, \\"What You Waiting For?\\", the same year. By 2009, sessions for the album ‚Äî now titled Pop Art ‚Äî had gone into a heavily pop music direction with producers such as Future Cut, Rick Nowels, Rob Davis, and Switch. As such, Mpho issued the mixtape Mpho & the Art of Pop in January 2009 with DJ Beware. To fund extensive promotion of the album Pop Art, Wall of Sound brokered Mpho a five-album deal with EMI's Parlophone subsidiary. Mpho's first single on Parlophone, the Switch-produced \\"Box N Locks\\" (which samples Martha and the Muffins' \\"Echo Beach\\"), was released in July 2009 and peaked at number 49 on the UK Singles Chart. Pop Art was scheduled to follow in October 2009, but following minimal airplay of second single \\"See Me Now\\" (featuring rapper Wale, the album was shelved. Mpho subsequently announced via Twitter that Parlophone had dropped her due to creative differences. Also in October, Mpho featured on the charity single \\"I Got Soul\\" with artists such as Frankmusik and VV Brown under the group name Young Soul Rebels; the single reached number ten in the UK, and proceeds went to War Child UK. In 2010, Mpho opened a vintage tea shop in Brixton with her sister. In 2012, she performed a one-off gig at London's Tate Modern gallery as part of an event celebrating the South London Black Music Archive. Artistry Mpho's influences include Andr√© 3000 of OutKast, Cassandra Wilson, Kate Bush, Kraftwerk, Mary J. Blige, Prince, Soul II Soul, and Stevie Wonder‚Äîartists, she says, \\"who are creative and don't just follow a clear and obvious formula\\". She frequently includes a cover of Bush's \\"Running Up That Hill\\" in her live set lists. More generally, Mpho has cited music of the 1970s and 1980s as an inspiration. Mpho has rejected genre labels and titles ascribed to her music, saying: \\"I find it extremely frustrating to be tied to one genre‚Äîit winds me up no end. It frustrates me that people need to define things in order to understand them [...] The one I'm happy landing with is 'pop' because you don't know what it sounds like. You can do what you want with pop as long as it's good and people like it.\\" She says that during her formative years, she listened to a mixture of her parents' music collections (which included Joni Mitchell, Sun Ra, and South African music) and genres popular in south London such as reggae, soul, R&B;, and ragga‚Äîshe describes her music as \\"none of those things but all of them\\". A profile by The Guardian introduced the singer as \\"part of a new breed of young black, or mixed race, London girls [...] who resolutely refuse to make the music that's expected of 'women of colour', such as R&B;, hip-hop or grime\\".

There, he became acquainted with notable Austrian √©migr√©s such as the composer Egon Wellesz and the musicologist Otto Erich Deutsch. In 1959 Branscombe joined the University of St Andrews' faculty of German Studies, a post he kept until the end of his life. In 1979, he founded St Andrews' Institute for Austrian Studies, the only such research facility in the United Kingdom. His interests included the popular theatre of the Biedermeier and the Viennese suburban theatre with authors like Raimund and Nestroy. He wrote works on Joseph Haydn, Mozart and Schubert. Over many years, he wrote reviews of concerts and recordings and contributed to The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians and the Wagner-Handbuch (Wagner Handbook) where he researched many forgotten composers of the 19th century. Branscombe also translated poems by Heinrich Heine and academic texts. Between 1996 and 2001, Branscombe edited six Possen for the historical-critical edition of Nestroy's complete works.

The recipient of the 2019 EMET prize award in Physics and Space Research. At a time when most astronomers believed that GRBs were galactic (see however an earlier suggestion by Bohdan Paczynski ) with Eichler, Livio and Schramm, Piran proposed that GRBs originate from cosmological neutron star binary mergers, a model that is generally accepted today. During the early nineties when the cosmological vs. galactic debate took place, Piran was one of the strongest and most vocal proponents of cosmological origin, which was confirmed in 1997 with the discovery of cosmological redshifts from GRB's afterglow. Even before the cosmological origin of GRBs was discovered Piran laid the foundation to the generally accepted cosmic fireball model. He suggested that GRBs herald the formation of a newborn black hole.NYT article 1999 Later on, together with Re'em Sari and other collaborators, Piran further developed the theory of GRB afterglows, in a paper which has by now more than 1000 citations, and of GRB jets. His review papers are the standard literature on this subject. Before working on GRBs, Piran made important contributions to numerical relativity, the numerical solution of Einstein's equations. In 1985 he wrote the first numerical code calculating the collapse and formation of a rotating black hole and the resulting gravitational radiation waveform. This waveform shows relaxation towards the quasinormal modes of the black hole that forms. Detection of this waveform in the future by advanced gravitational radiation detectors might provide the ultimate proof of the existence of a black hole. In addition to these works, Piran's contributions range over a selection of problems in Relativistic Astrophysics. He demonstrated the critical dependence of the stability of accretion disks on the cooling and heating mechanisms. Piran was the first to point out that inflation is a generic phenomenon involving any scalar field (without requiring a specific potential) and, in particular, that this is so for a free massive scalar field. He went on later to show that, in fact, the onset of inflation is not fully generic and it requires specific initial conditions, a concept whose full implications have not been addressed up to now. He was the first to suggest and show that cosmic biasing depends on galaxy types and that different galaxies are distributed differently in the Universe. This is a concept that seems obvious today but was controversial when proposed in the late eighties. Piran's work includes also contributions to the general theory of relativity such as one of the strongest counter examples to the cosmic censorship hypothesis and the demonstration of the instability of the inner structure of a black hole. In addition to Piran's work as an astrophysicist, he has served from 2005 until 2009 as the dean of the Hebrew University School of Business Administration. During this term he has made revisions in the school.

It was founded by Vietnam Veteran and Social worker Paul W Kruse and his wife Lana Kruse. It has helped many homeless and hopeless people in St. Charles, Lincoln and Warren Counties of Missouri, to find a stable home and job. Since 2005, FSBH has helped more than 3,000 homeless people become self-sufficient. It has been running programs with the help of Community Council of St. Charles Continuum. History FSBH was started in March, 2005 by Paul Kruse, a Vietnam Veteran who served in US Navy as Airman and Seaman. Paul and his wife started Trucker Church Ministry in Foristell, Missouri, with now more than 2,500 truckers who have attended services and have heard the Gospel preached for over the 6 and a half years. He became aware of the lack of resources and gaps in services provided by the local social service providers for homeless men in St. Charles County, and started his Ministry spawned by a $1000 gift from a local business. FSBH has helped more than 3000 homeless in the area to get lodging, food, clothing, jobs, find transportation, and ultimately become self-sustaining again. Support for FSBH has come from the community via businesses, community groups and individual contributions and none has come from the Federal government or Local Government. Board of directors FSBH is operated by the local staff of people, who come from various backgrounds.

The major occupation of the people living at this place is agriculture and handloom. In 2011, it had a population of 2,000 people.http://www.indiamapped.com/tamil-nadu/viluppuram/tirukkoyilur/jambai/ Etymology Jambai got its name from Jambunatheshwarar temple, a Chola period (Shiva) temple. According to the inscriptions present inside the temple, this village was called as Valayur during the Parantaka Chola I period. Hence, \\"Jambai\\" might be a later name to this village. This temple is situated at the banks of river Thenpenaiyaar, where there was lots of kora grass grown, the tamil word for kora grass is sambu, Hence the name Jambu and also there is an inherited Old story that the elephant belonging to the king went there to dip itself in water, where it stumbled upon the Shivlinga, blood started oozing from the Shivlingam, hearing the call of the frightened elephant people started to gather and this incidence reached the ears of the king and then the temple was built. Jambu means elephant. As the Shivalingam was found by the elephant the village and temple was named after it. Location Jambai is located on the northern bank of the river, Thenpennai. It is northwest of Tirukkoyilur and south of Thiruvannaamalai. About the village Jambai village has more-than-1000-year-old heritage. At Jambai, Saivism, Jainism, Buddhism and Saktism prevailed. In 2006, a beautifully carved 10th century A.D. Buddha sculpture was stolen from the middle of the Fort area paddy field. There are two Siva temples, One Saptamatrika shrine, one Ayynar temple on the hill and other Ayyanar temple in north east corner of the village. Jain Tirthankara relief carving is seen in the hill on the way to Pallichandal. The importance of the village comes from the presence of the Shiva temple called Jambunatheshwarar temple and Jambaimalai containing 1st century CE Tamil Brahmi inscriptions, Jain abode, caves and beds. Jambunatheshwarar Temple Jambunatheshwarar Temple In Tamil, this temple is called Thanthondreeswarar temple (). This Shiva temple was built by Cholas during 10th century. The temple walls contain full of Tamil vattezhuttu inscriptions of Cholas. This place was under Rashtrakuta rule during the mid 10th century, the statues of Lord Muruga, Jyestha Devi, Kalabairavar, Durga belonging to Rashtrakuta architecture, are found inside the temple. Since the temple become very old and damaged, reconstruction works are carried by local people of Jambai now.K. Selvaraj, \\"Jambai oru aayvu\\", State Department of Archeology, Chennai Jambaimalai 1st century CE Tamil Brahmi inscription This is a small hillock in the north east of the village. Between a split area of this hillock there are signs of megalithic period settlement. The hillock contains a cavern called Dasimadam where Tamizhi inscriptions dated to 1st century CE is found. The epigraph is in Tamil (except for the title in Prakrit) and reads \\"Satiyaputo Atiyan Nedumaan Anjji itta Paali\\". In ().K. Selvaraj, \\"Jambai oru aayvu\\", State Department of Archeology, Chennai The meaning of the epigraph may be rendered as \\"The abode (pali) given by (itta) Atiyan Nedumaan Anji (name), the Satyaputra (title)\\". Though the record is a short one in a single line, it throws valuable light on various aspects of South Indian history. The inscription clears the doubt about the identity of the Satyaputras, a dynasty of rulers, mentioned in Ashoka's inscriptions in the 3rd century BCE. Opposite to this cavern, another cave with four Jain stone beds have been found which confirms that Jambai was a Jain centre.D. Ramesh, \\"Nadunaattu Samanakovilkal\\" (2nd ed.)

Looney Tunes cartoon, directed by Jack King. The short was released on May 18, 1935, and stars Buddy, the second star of the series. The title is likely a reference to the 1925 silent film The Lost World, itself based upon the 1912 novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The music playing throughout much of the cartoon is \\"Lullaby of Broadway\\", played in a minor key. Summary Captain Buddy leaves on a maritime expedition around the world as many adoring well-wishers cheer him on. The crowd stands on a dock, which is pulled apart as Buddy's motorboat, still tied to the structure, sails away, leaving the people floating in the water. The story skips ahead in time, and Buddy & his companion Bozo the dog have found land. It is, as Buddy notes upon looking about and checking his map, the \\"Lost Island!\\" Buddy, in his excitement, leaves Bozo to sniff footprints that move away from him every time they are sniffed. This process takes Bozo through a forest, dominated, as we find, by a brontosaurus, whose discovery frightens the dog into a run. Bozo topples a cavelady jumproping, and encounters a caveman who seems to suppose himself a dog, as he digs up a bone and scurries off with it; Bozo finds a bone as well, which leads him to unearth an entire dinosaur skeleton! The dog becomes trapped within the skeleton's rib cage; Buddy sees this and flips his lid. By opening the mouth of the deceased dinosaur, Buddy is able to rescue his companion. Buddy now spies, through some reeds, another peculiar fellow acting like a dog, and calls Bozo over to see. But, despite Buddy's injunctions to silence, Bozo's yelping scares the strange man away. The dog chases the fleeing fellow into a cave, in which both are then trapped. Buddy calls after Bozo and is eaten by a gigantic, ravenous plant, whose digestive tract leaves him on a hillside, overlooking a society of cavemen, some hard at work, others busying themselves with croquet. Our Hero decides to descend, and so slides down the neck of what happens to be a very friendly brontosaurus. We see then three Stooge-esque cavemen abusing each other; one indicates Bozo the dog, who is tied up very close by. The Stooge takes Bozo to what turns out to be the base of a cage. Buddy, hurrying away from his dinosaur friend in order to rescue Bozo, also becomes ensnared in the cage. The story skips ahead in time again. Buddy and his companion are in a pot of water, presumably in order for them to be cooked. Two of the Lost Island's cave denizens perform an absurd dancing ritual that involves a good measure of abuse by clubs; the crowd of cave people watch as the ritual takes place. Buddy shouts for help, and is heard by none other than his brontosaurus friend from earlier. The approaching dinosaur scares off all of the cavemen, some of whom are further picked up by the great beast and thrown off-screen. The dinosaur then places Buddy and Bozo on its back. Giving his thanks, Buddy places his sailor's hat upon his new friend's head, and is licked affectionately by both of his animal friends.

Origins He was the younger son of William Dalison (d.1546) of Laughton, Lincolnshire, Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1546 and Escheator of Lincolnshire, by his wife, a daughter of George Wastneys of Haddon, Nottinghamshire. Career He entered Gray's Inn in 1534 and was called to the bar in 1537. He was elected Reader of Gray's Inn in 1548 and again in 1552, on one of which occasions he gave a lecture on the statute 32 Henry VIII, chapter 33, concerning wrongful disseisin, which is referred to in Dyer's Reports (219 a) as a correct statement of the law. He took the degree of serjeant-at-law in 1552, receiving from his Inn the sum of ¬£5 and a pair of gloves. He served as a Member of Parliament for Lincolnshire in October 1553. In 1554 he was appointed one of the justices of the County Palatine of Lancaster. In 1556 he was appointed a Justice of the King's Bench and was knighted. His patent was renewed on the accession of Queen Elizabeth I (November 1558). Marriage and children He married Elizabeth Dighton, a daughter of Robert Dighton of Sturton Parva, Lincolnshire (who survived him and re-married to Sir Francis Ayscough), by whom he had issue four sons and five daughters. His descendants eventually settled in Kent, and were represented in the female line in the 19th century by Maximilian Hammond Dalison of Hamptons, near Tunbridge. Death and burial He died in January 1559, and was buried in Lincoln Cathedral. Works Dalison compiled a collection of cases decided during the reigns of Edward VI and Philip and Mary (Harl. MS. 5141). His so-called ‚ÄòReports‚Äô were published in the same volume with some by Serjeant William Benloe in 1689;As to this volume, see Benloe and Dalison's Reports but the greater portion of those attributed to Dalison were decided after his death. J. H. Baker writing in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography comments that for the period 1546 to 1558 Dalison's cases are hard to separate from those of Richard Harpur.

She has taught these classical principles to students around the world for the past two decades, both in person and via the internet, and now shares her thoughts and experience on Marji's Blog. In addition, as a result of 25 years of genetic development within her herd of horses, she has registered a new breed of performance horse, the Spanish Warmblood.  Early life  Marjorie Jean Armstrong (n√©e McInnes) was born in Mortlake, Victoria, Australia on 18 September 1943. She was named after Marjorie Lawrence (soprano), who her mother admired so much that she wanted to name her daughter after her. She grew up in the Australian bush, working with livestock on her family‚Äôs property in theWestern District of Victoria, followed as a young adult by experience on the land in outback Queensland and Western Australia. Following her move to WA in 1966, she married Anthony Gordon (Tony) Armstrong in 1968. The family, including son Warwick (b. 1969), owned a mixed farming operation near Cranbrook, Western Australia. In the early years of the marriage, the family ran the farm as well as several small rural business operations, including a local transport company (operated until Tony‚Äôs death in 2007), and a shearing contracting business. With her husband doing the shearing, Marji was the cook and part-time rouseabout. In partnership with her sister-in-law Rosemary McInnes, Marji started \\"Bushman‚Äôs Bazaar\\", an early cottage industry specialising in home made products including spun and knitted goods, jams, preserves and morning and afternoon teas for tourist buses. She was instrumental in forming a local tourism promotion group for the Cranbrook area. In 1986, Marji opened an equestrian centre dedicated to Classical Equestrian Arts in Forrestfield, Perth, which she ran until moving it back to Cranbrook in 1999. In 1985, she purchased her Spanish Andalusian stallion, Dulcero, from the van der Drift family in Qld and was influential in the re-formation of the then defunct Western Australian Branch of the Andalusian Horse Association of Australasia. During these years she competed successfully in FEI dressage, horse trials and the show ring before switching to teaching and training. She held an International Competitors License for several years.  Influences  As a child, Marji came under the influence of Franz Mairinger, trainer of Australia‚Äôs double gold medal winning eventing team at the 1960 Rome Olympics. Mairinger regularly conducted clinics in Victoria‚Äôs Western Districts where she was a young pony club member. Marji first encountered the teaching and riding of Mestre Nuno Oliveira in 1984 when he was in Australia.\\"The Riding Masters - Nuno Oliveira \\", The Horse magazine, June 1984, pp16-18 She organised his clinics in Western Australia until his death in Perth in 1989. Nuno Oliveira inspired her with a philosophy of working in cooperation with the horse, rather than achieving results by domination. The ultimate aim of this approach is lightness, in which the aids become mere suggestions, and the horse is able to maintain its own balance without interference. She illustrates this with a demonstration of lungeing her Spanish Warmblood gelding Yardah Tosco using only knitting wool in place of the conventional lunge rein.Yardah Tosco - Beyond the Yarn - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esTSOSqEFRw&playnext;=1&list;=PL74A3560C01223B43&index;=20 Marji trained in Europe with acknowledged masters including Luis Valenca Rodrigues, Nuno Oliveira‚Äôs son Joao (after his father‚Äôs death) and the Ecole Nationale de Equitation (Le Cadre Noir) at Saumur, France. She attended a performance of Theatre Equestre Zingaro, where she met Bartabas, the creator of the performance. She has been a passionate scholar of classical horse training during her odyssey around the world.  Training philosophy  Marji‚Äôs training philosophy is founded in the classical school of dressage whose roots extend back to Xenophon, through Pignatelli, Pluvinel, William Cavendish, first Duke of Newcastle, de la Gueriniere, Baucher and Fillis. In circa 1995, Marji became a world pioneer by including classical in-hand training as a regular feature of every clinic, introducing thousands of students worldwide to the importance of in-hand training. Her adherence to classical methods was considered controversial in the early years, when Germanic training philosophies held sway. Now that the current generation of riders have begun to recognise the benefits of training the horse in-hand, Marji‚Äôs approach is acknowledged as correct and beneficial for the minds and bodies of horses of all shapes, sizes and breeds. The basis of her training is her five-day clinic for horse and rider. She has trained horses and riders in South Africa, Zimbabwe, UK, Austria, Italy, U.S.A., Canada, New Zealand, Asia and Australia. During her 45 world tours since 1992, she has introduced over 15,000 students internationally to the training of horses according to the classical principles.\\"Riding ‚Äì Art or Science?\\" Your Horse magazine, (UK) September 1996, pp 88-90 Marji encourages and challenges her pupils‚Äô personal boundaries. She believes it is possible to develop riders and horses beyond their natural talent to their ultimate potential through systematic training‚Äîin hand first, and then from the saddle. Her training benefits all breeds and ages of horse and rider, in multiple disciplines, and can produce remarkable results with horses which, in some cases, are physically challenged or psychologically disturbed by previous training, breed or age. As well as experienced riders and horses, first-time clinic participants and beginner horses or riders can produce work in the soft manner espoused by the classical masters. All clinics are video taped, with more than 3,000 hours of clinic videos held. The tapes provide proof of the value of the work and training philosophy.  Achievements  Marji competed successfully in FEI dressage, horse trials and the show ring. In 1989, Marji was invited to ride Philippe Karl's horse, Odin, at the Le Cadre Noir in Saumur, France. Marji is an international judge, judging at the National Andalusian Championships in New Zealand in 1998, and was a judge at the Andalusian National Championships in Canberra in 1993. In 1993, she was invited to ride the horses of the Prime Minister of Malaysia. In 1996, she was a speaker at the National Championships in Texas, USA, for the IALHA (International Andalusian & Lusitano Horse Association). Marji was an Educator at Equitana Melbourne in 1999 and Equitana Sydney in 2011. In 1999, a team of her students performed a quadrille depicting a Baroque Carousel at the inaugural Equitana in Melbourne. In 2006, Marji was a Western Australian finalist in the RIRDC Rural Women‚Äôs Award.\\"Cranbrook equestrian arts trainer recognised in international arenas\\", RRR Network News for Rural, Remote and Regional Women in Western Australia p 8. www.rrr.wa.gov.au/documents/RRR_issue35.pdf Marji has trained a wide range of people, from those who have been physically challenged, to royalty, to celebrities, and everyone in between. Well known singer, Shania Twain, attended two of Marji's clinics, and was so impressed that she brought her own trainer to a clinic. Marji has taught in every Australian state except the Northern Territory.  Breeding enterprise  At Yardah Stud and Equestrian Centre in Western Australia, Marji also runs a breeding operation. After 25 years of development, she has registered a new breed of horse, the Spanish Warmblood. Some of the horses she has produced are competing at International and National level. Yardah Ximenez (now retired in the U.K.) competed in Europe in both showjumping and dressage to Prix St. George, while Yardah Cairo placed in national level showjumping competitions in Perth in 2011. Realising that a project of this magnitude needs to be achieved over decades, Marji has made the decision to invite her students and other enthusiasts to become members and part owners of Yardah Stud. This opportunity will be launched later in 2016.  Published works  Passive Stretching Exercises for the Horse has been published as an e-book, and is available by registering. Training Demystified covers the philosophy of Classical training as well as providing practical direction. The text is fully edited, and is awaiting illustration and graphic design. She has also produced a series of training DVDs, which cover the in‚Äìhand training of the horse. The DVDs were due to be released in 2012, but this was postponed due to Marji having a stroke in Austria in October 2012. Following the stroke, Marji has undergone \\"Marji's Renaissance\\", and is now riding and teaching again, and after initially \\"losing her words\\" after the stroke, she is now confident enough to initiate a blog.

Border crossing Border crossing of vehicles between Phulbari in India and Banglabandha in Bangladesh was inaugurated on January 2011. Earlier, Nepal- Bangladesh transit through the border started in a limited manner in 1997. Goods-laden trucks from both sides cross the border and unload the goods at warehouses in the other country. The Indian Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Bangladesh's Agriculture Minister Matia Chowdhury attended the inauguration ceremony. This border crossing can also be used for the movement of people between Bangladesh and India. There are complaints about lack of proper facilities at the border, and condition of the road between Phulbari and India-Nepal border. India has taken steps to improve the road between Kankarbhitta, where the Nepalese check-post is located, across the Mechi River from NH 31C and Phulbari border post on State Highway 12.

History   1996-2002  Bad Afro Records is an independent record label based in Copenhagen, Denmark. The label was founded in 1996 with the purpose of releasing rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll, punk, surf and garage rock from the Scandinavian countries and Finland. The name, logo and the original slogan ‚ÄúPushing Scandinavian Rock to the Man!‚Äù was inspired by blaxsploitation movies from the early 1970s like Superfly, Foxy Brown and Dolemite. Bad Afro Records was originally an offshoot of Moshable Magazine (1986‚Äì2000). Moshable was an underground punk and garage rock magazine that had focus on the Scandinavian music scene and featured early interviews with bands like The Hellacopters, Turbonegro, Gluecifer and The Flaming Sideburns. In the mid 1990s, the Scandinavian garage rock scene was in full bloom and bands that appeared in Moshable started to be released on vinyl on Bad Afro Records. The original idea and goal was to release 50 7‚Äù vinyl singles in 10 years to document the music scene in Scandinavia at the time. This goal was never reached ‚Äì 10 years later only 45 7‚Äùsingles had been released. Bad Afro Records began as a singles club where members could sign up and receive the upcoming six vinyl 7‚Äù singles on the label. The concept was inspired by the American label Sub Pop which had started their singles club nearly a decade earlier with great success. In 1999 the first album by The Flaming Sideburns was released and although the singles club continued a few years after that the focus of the label shifted towards full album releases. In the early years, most releases on Bad Afro Records could be described as garage rock and punk rock with a few excursions into weirder musical territories. At the time the label worked with artists such as The Hellacopters, Turbonegro, The Nomads, The Flaming Sideburns, The Burnouts, Backyard Babies, Gluecifer, Larry & the Lefthanded, The Chronics, Festermen and The Royal Beat Conspiracy as well as many other bands pretty much in the same vein.  2002-2009  In many ways 2001 to 2004 was the heyday of Bad Afro Records. Scandinavian rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll was praised all over the world and The Flaming Sideburns were doing very well touring all over the world and was licensed to countries like USA and Australia. In 2003 came the national breakthrough for Bad Afro Records with the release of the Baby Woodrose album ‚ÄúMoney For Soul‚Äù that featured two major hits on National Radio and was nominated for a Danish Grammy. Baby Woodrose also did a collaboration with Danish beat legend Peter Belli that topped the charts on National Danish Radio and the band played two years in a row on the main stage at the famous Roskilde Festival. In 2003, Bad Afro re-issued the debut album ‚ÄúBlows Your Mind‚Äù by Baby Woodrose which led to some controversy and discussions on freedom of speech for artists. The original artwork was done by the Italian artist collective Malleus and the most important music outlet at the time, Myspace, banned the cover and censored the artwork on several occasions. The artwork was an erotic painting that also made the German pressing plant refuse to print the LP version. From 2003, the Bad Afro Records slowly took a bend towards psychedelic rock in the sense that most of the new bands that was signed in this period often had a psychedelic edge. Besides keeping on releasing Baby Woodrose albums it also meant collaborations with artists like On Trial, The Setting Son, Dragontears and Sarena-Maneesh.  2009-2012  After 13 years of \\"Pushing Scandinavian Rock to the Man!\\", as the original slogan goes, the label took another turn in 2009 and decided that it was too limiting only releasing music from Scandinavia. In came The Dolly Rocker Movement from Australia and The Mojomatics from Italy and there is releases by US bands Cosmonauts and Royal Baths on the way in 2012. As a curiosum it can be mentioned that Bad Afro Records since the beginning as a vinyl based record label has had a policy that makes it easy to tell the difference between first print of the LP's or 7‚Äù singles and later prints. First print is on black vinyl, second print is on red vinyl, 3rd print is on green vinyl and 4th print is on purple vinyl.

Although not itself a success, the design was considered worth developing, and a series of similar aircraft were produced in prototype form, eventually leading to the Vickers F.B.5 \\"Gunbus\\", which saw widespread service during World War I. Design The Experimental Fighting Biplane No. 1 (E.F.B.1) was designed in response to a British Admiralty requirement for an aircraft intended for an offensive role. As such, it was notable for being the first British aircraft to be specifically designed for a military role. A contract for an experimental prototype was given to Vickers on 19 November 1912. The resulting aircraft was an unequal-span staggered wing, two-bay pusher biplane with the tailplane mounted on booms behind the wings and the crew of two housed in a nacelle above the lower wing, with the engine behind them. The pusher layout was chosen to meet the requirement for a forward- firing gun, since gun synchronisation mechanisms had not been developed at the time. Extensive use of metal was made in its structure, the tail booms and wing spars being made of steel and the nacelle of steel tube with a covering of sheet duralumin.\\"What There Will Be To See Art Olympia\\"Flight 8 February 1913 p149 Lateral control was effected by wing warping, and in order to prevent fatiguing of the structure caused by warping loads the rear wing spar was built in three sections, the outer sections being hinged to the centre section, and the wing ribs were loosely threaded onto the spars. The armament consisted of a single belt-fed 0.303 Vickers-Maxim machine gun mounted at the front of the nacelle on a flexible mounting. It was exhibited at the Aero show at Olympia in February 1913, but crashed soon afterwards, possibly on its first flight. Nevertheless, the design was considered promising enough for work to be started on another aircraft of similar design, the Vickers E.F.B.2, and this line of development would eventually lead to the Vickers F.B.5 Gunbus.

Navi Mumbai metro line 1 phase 2 will be passing through Navade road and shall have interconnection with Navade railway station. Panvel-Virar local train which is approved from the government and the work is expected to start soon. There are many prominent buildings like Devdrishti, Dev Aashirwad, Neelkamal,Keshav Garden,Laxmi Kalash etc.Navade colony is on NH4 highway and connects to Sion Panvel expressway via Taloja link road. Usually there is heavy traffic of trailers and trucks due to nearby MIDC area, but once the NH4 road widening is completed and proposed service roads are constructed, much lighter traffic is expected. There is also smell problem from nearby Taloja MIDC for which Navade and Kharghar/Kalamboli residents are fighting. Nearby Kasadi river is passing through Navade node but this river has contaminated water and the aqua life is totally dead due to careless attitude of the factories in Taloja MIDC. Recently Cidco had started to construct a holding pond in Navade near Devdrishti apartment but left it half done after some works. The internal roads have been in too poor state waiting for the awarded contractor to start construction work. Cidco has developed a beautiful garden with children play area with slides and other equipments. Although small, this garden is having a jogging track, benches and lush green lawn.Unlike other Cidco nodes. There are plots reserved for Police station, market, temple and post office but is not at all developed from Cidco. Every Thursday and Saturday there is market which sells vegetables,household items, clothes,bags,shoes etc. Almost all types of shops are opened in Navade node and it is self contained with very less dependency of travelling to other nodes. Also there is one 6 bed full fledged hospital Anand Hospital in Navade apart from various clinics. Heavy vehicles and trailers are parked illegally at the internal roadside for which government should take action to avoid inconvenience to Navade residences.

It reflects on the Holocaust and includes East European folk singing, Rabbinical chants, klezmer fiddling, sampled voices (including Hitler's), heavy metal guitar and industrial synthesizer. Brian Eno described it as \\"the most frightening record I have ever heard\\". Kaddish was Towering Inferno's debut album. It was released on their own TI Records in 1993, and then globally by Island Records in 1995. Background Towering Inferno was the duo of musicians Richard Wolfson and Andy Saunders. Wolfson was also a performance artist, cameraman and journalist, and had previously worked with Saunders in several groups. Wolfson and Saunders, both of European-Jewish descent, formed Towering Inferno in 1985 as an \\"ambient, techno and heavy metal\\" multimedia stage project that involved electronics and film. The duo toured Europe, augmenting their performances with slide and super 8 projectors. In 1986 they met Hungarian performance poet Endre Szk√°rosi in Italy at the Bologna Festival and were impressed by his cryptic works which challenged Communist dictatorship and explored European identity. Wolfson and Saunders decided to explore their own identities and spent the next five years on the road filming, performing and creating what became Kaddish, named for the Jewish prayer of the same name. Roger Riley, a visual director who accompanied Wolfson and Saunders across Europe, said that \\"The long gestation of the project gave it a depth and richness it would not otherwise have had\\". They travelled thousands of miles, performing in Europe's underground circuit in venues as diverse as riding stables and slaughterhouses. These images, including those from a visit to the Dachau concentration camp, stimulated the creative process. Saunders said that they were also influenced by their experiences as children in synagogue, in particular sounds of the shofar, kaddish and the choirs. He said he found it unusual the other Jewish musicians like Bob Dylan, Lou Reed and Leonard Cohen tended to shy away from their \\"Jewishness\\" rather than embrace it. Towering Inferno began performing Kaddish in the mid-1980s, and started recording it in 1991. The duo described the work, which included references to the history and folk-lore of Central and Eastern Europe and to the Shoah, as \\"a dream history of Europe in the wake of the Holocaust\\". Recording and release Kaddish was composed and performed by Towering Inferno, with Hungarian folk-songs, which were adapted for the work, sung by Endre Szk√°rosi and Hungarian folk vocalist M√°rta Sebesty√©n. A number of guest musicians featured on the recording, including John Marshall and Elton Dean from Soft Machine, Chris Cutler and Tim Hodgkinson from Henry Cow, the five-piece Electra Strings, and the 100-piece London Welsh Chorale (Choral Cymry Llundain). The album was recorded by Gregg Skerman, a Swiss engineer who had accompanied the band through Europe as their sound mixer. Recording began at London's Diorama in 1991. To take advantage of the venue's five- to six-second reverb, the drums and acoustic instruments were recorded in the middle of the dome with suspended Neumann KM84 microphones. Some drum- machine samples were also used, but these were played back in the Diorama and recorded as the other instruments had been. The use of multiple microphones allowed for the mixing of both close and distant sources, resulting in a sound which Saunders said \\"the best digital reverb in the world couldn't reproduce\\". Later, other instruments were also recorded in the Diorama. The choral segments, which had previously been taped with Kenneth Bowen, their conductor, were sampled, rearranged and played back in the dome to be recorded with the added reverb. Wolfson and Saunders also added into the mix samples of their own unrelated work that they had performed over the previous five years. The Hungarian folk songs were recorded with Szk√°rosi and Sebesty√©n at the 3M Studios in Budapest with a Fostex 16-track recorder. Wolfson recalled that when they were taping Szk√°rosi reciting a poem of his over the London Welsh Chorale for \\"Sto Mondo Rotondo\\", a thunderstorm broke over the city, and they opened the studio doors to let in the sound of the storm. Wolfson said \\"It sounds like tape hiss, but it's actually rain in Budapest\\". While in Budapest Wolfson and Saunders interviewed Chief Rabbi Tamas Raj, who agreed to let them record him reciting the Kaddish. The prayer was recorded by Saunders on a Casio DA3 DAT, and he remarked that \\"it was spoken in the rare and beautiful Transylvanian dialect, and he graciously gave his permission for it to be used on the album\\". Towering Inferno experimented constantly with the sound on the album's tracks to create the right atmosphere they wanted, and they tried a number of fuzz boxes on the guitars and other instruments. The metallic sound on \\"Reverse Field\\" was achieved by an Ibanez Roadstar guitar with a RAT distortion pedal fed through a Roland 301 Space Echo. The spoken/sung passages were also distorted, including Rabbi Raj's recitation of the Kaddish, and Szk√°rosi's poetry, where a Fuzz Face was used. The album was mixed and mastered over a period of ten weeks at Lavender Hill Studios in London. It was mixed onto DAT, enabling a transfer to hard-disk for digital mastering. Crossfades and overlays were added before the final CD master was made. Recommended Records, an English independent record label owned and managed by Chris Cutler, released Kaddish on Towering Inferno's own TI Records in 1993. When Brian Eno heard the album he expressed his admiration for it, and this enabled Inferno's manager to sign a contract with Island Records, which released Kaddish globally in 1995. Performances The first live performance of the album took place in July 1994 in Fribourg, Switzerland at the Belluard Bollwerk International Festival. Eight musicians performed the work, supplemented by keyboard-controlled samples and live DAT material. The 1995 global release of the album by Island Records came with a ¬£80,000 budget, enabling Towering Inferno to add an 18-string orchestra and three large-screen projectors to their shows. This elevated their performances from the underground circuit to concert halls and opera houses around the world, including shows across Europe in Vienna, Berlin, Warsaw, Budapest and Moscow. In London Kaddish was performed at the Institute of Contemporary Arts on 1 October 1995, from where it was broadcast live on BBC Radio 3. The show ended its run in 1999 with three capacity performances at the Melbourne State Opera House. These multimedia performances were well received by critics. While Szk√°rosi said that these big-budget shows \\"deepened the emotions and nuances of the piece\\", Saunders felt that it \\"squeezed much of the creativity from what had started as an underground event.\\" Wolfson died in February 2005 at the age of 49 after work had begun on a second Towering Inferno album entitled The Other Side. Wolfson's tombstone is engraved with a line from Kaddish by Szk√°rosi: \\"This sky will cover you when you fall down\\". Reception Mojo magazine said Kaddish deploys a wide range of musical genres, and including minimalist ambient, metal, classical piano, string quartets and jazz, and called it \\"a sonic tapestry of thousands of years, lamenting what is lost in periods of great destruction.\\" Brian Eno said Kaddish drew on a mix of influences \\"existing on the cusp of art and commerce, a cusp we did not know previously to exist\\". He believes \\"a piece of work should seduce you immediately, or should beat you over the head, which this one does. It's very immediate, there's no doubt it's affecting you when you're listening to it.\\" Eno described Kaddish as \\"the most frightening record I have ever heard\\". In a Richard Wolfson obituary, The Daily Telegraph said that Towering Inferno was \\"one of the most original and provocative performance-art bands of the 1990s\\", and described Kaddish as \\"a shocking and unforgettable piece\\". In another Wolfson obituary, The Guardian called the work \\"a complex and disturbing meditation on the Shoah that makes Steve Reich's Different Trains seem simplistic in comparison\\". Richie Unterberger writing in AllMusic said that Kaddish, which \\"reflects the horrors and wounds of the Holocaust with subtle (and largely wordless) complexity\\", is \\"not for everyone\\", but added that \\"[a]dventurous listeners will find much to chew on for repeated listenings\\". Sound on Sound said that Kaddish \\"not only satisfies on a musical level, but comes through with a sound of its own\\".

It is commonly known as the beau gregory or beaugregory.Stegastes leucostictus (Castelnau, 1855) FishBase. Retrieved 2011-12-26. Description Stegastes leucostictus is a fairly deep-bodied, oval, laterally compressed bony fish, and grows to about long. It is rather variable in colour, but is generally dark blue or brown along the top of the head and the ridge of the back and yellowish on the flanks. The large dorsal fin has 12 spines and 13 to 16 soft rays. The anal fin has two spines and 12 to 14 soft rays. The caudal fin has a shallow fork and the paired pectoral and pelvic fins have no spines. The mouth is set at the tip of the snout. A juvenile S. leucostictus has blue stripes and spots on its head and a dull blue sheen on the top of the head and the upper part of the front half of the body. It has a large, black eye-spot ringed in blue, centered where the dorsal fin spines join the soft rays. As the juvenile develops, this spot moves upwards onto the fin. Also, a dark spot just above each pectoral fin distinguishes this species from others in the genus.Stegastes leucostictus Pomacentridae. Retrieved 2011-12-27. Distribution and habitat Stegastes leucostictus is found in shallow waters at depths down to about in the western Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends from Florida and the Gulf of Mexico south to Brazil. It is a demersal fish, normally remaining within 50 cm of the seabed. Its favoured habitats are seagrass meadows, rocky or coral reefs and sandy flats and it is sometimes found amongst mangroves. Biology Stegastes leucostictus feeds mainly on seaweed, but also consumes marine worms, amphipods, foraminiferans and gastropod molluscs. A male damselfish guards a territory, but seldom interacts with its neighbours, although it will attack a male of the same species introduced in a bottle placed in its territory. Dominance is related to the quality of the territory it occupies. The owner of a high-quality territory exhibits dominance and if it is removed and a subservient male moves in, it in turn develops dominance. During the breeding season, a male and a female form a pair bond. The eggs are hidden inside an empty shell or under a stone, and the male guards the nest and fans the eggs with its fins to keep them well oxygenated. The bluehead eats the eggs of S. leucostictus. The wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum (bluehead), preys upon the eggs of S. leucostictus. A male damselfish can evaluate the level of the threat posed by one or more wrasse and react appropriately. It either chases the other fish, harries it, or adopts a head-lowered, threatening posture.

Kusionowicz was also the editor of Gwiazdka Cieszy≈Ñska from 1889 to 1890. An associate of Pawe≈Ç Stalmach (cs), who founded Gwiazdka Cieszy≈Ñska, he was also a friend of J√≥zef Londzin (pl) with whom he shared the early vision of Cieszyn Silesia joining Galicia in a new Polish state independent of Austrian rule. On 7 September 1906 Kusionowicz changed his surname to Grody≈Ñski and was later appointed President of the Silesian Court of Appeal in Katowice. Following World War I (WWI) he represented the Polish High Court in Krak√≥w for the legal transitioning of Silesia into the newly independent Poland.Krzy≈ºanowski 2011, 83. Early years One of a large number of children of Sylwester and Anna (n√©e Krƒô≈ºo≈Çek), Andrzej was born in Gd√≥w, Galicia, Poland, to where his father had moved from Chochol√≥w (pl) subsequent to the Battle of Gd√≥w. (The sole battle of the Krak√≥w Uprising was chronicled by Sylwester‚Äôs ‚Äúuncle‚Äù Ludwik Kusionowicz who in 1846 was the Gd√≥w parish priest.Radzikowski 1904, 115. Ludwik, who like Sylwester was born in Czch√≥w, was later appointed Dean of Wieliczka and by EC/RM Ordination of 26 July 1871 was awarded the honorary title of Canon of Tarn√≥w.) In addition to starting the first 'state school' in the district, conducting lessons in Polish in the former parish school building, Andrzej‚Äôs father, Sylwester, performed as the church organist. Andrzej was raised in Western Galicia but when he was only fifteen his father died (on 4 July 1877) and his elder brother J√≥zef, a notary in Mil√≥wka, became his legal guardian. After completing his schooling Andrzej attended universities in Krak√≥w, Graz and Vienna, then moved to Cieszyn Silesia due to his keen interest in Polish affairs centred in that region.

This culminated in a nationalistic call for Polish Catholics and Polish Protestants to work together in selecting and voting for candidates in the forthcoming elections for the Silesian Parliament.Gwiazdka Cieszy≈Ñska 1890, 43#23. Although the Sejm at the time was dominated by German representatives, this was a controversial plea given that the publisher of Gwiazdka Cieszy≈Ñska from 1889 was the Katolickie Towarzystwo Prasowe (Catholic Press Society). On 14 June 1890 fr J√≥zef Londzin, in his first editorial on taking over from Kusionowicz, made no direct reference to this patriotic call by his predecessor but informed readers that he had been entrusted by the ‚ÄòCatholic hierarchy‚Äô with the publication‚Äôs editorship before then making his own plea for the Polish nation and people of Silesia to guard against the forces of liberalism and Germanisation.Gwiazdka Cieszy≈Ñska 1890, 43#24. While Kusionowicz was the editor, Gwiazdka Cieszy≈Ñska had continued to espouse the ideals of Pawe≈Ç Stalmach in advocating support of many social causes ranging from improving the welfare of the poor to progressing literacy and education levels, especially among the ethnic Poles in Silesia and Galicia.

In 1907 he transferredDziennik Cieszy≈Ñski 1908, III#22, 3. to the District Court in Cieszyn, in which city he continued to reside (at 34 Bielitzerstrasse now Bielska street) even after his later appointment as President of the Court of Appeal in Katowice. Following the establishment in 1918 of the National Council of The Duchy of Cieszyn (pl) after World War I, comprising representatives of Polish political groups that had arisen over the preceding fifty years (and including fr J√≥zef Londzin, Jan Michejda, and Tadeusz Reger (pl)), the 'Easements Commission' was set up with dr Andrzej Grody≈Ñski appointed as its Chairman. In addition to also carrying out his regular judicial duties, Andrzej participated in other significant meetings for the new Polish state and early in 1921 he was a member of the Polish delegation that entered into the first official talks with Czech representatives following the peace agreement reached in Paris on 20 November 1920.Gwiazdka Cieszy≈Ñska 1921, 74#3, 3. The early years of the Second Polish Republic placed onerous demands on Poland's judiciary which in turn reportedlyKrzy≈ºanowski 2011, 250. led to a high mortality rate amongst those who chose to keep working in the service of their country rather than retire. Andrzej died in 1925 and is buried at Cieszyn Municipal Cemetery (pl), but outwith the impressive family tomb erected by his father-in-law Alfons Matter. The funeral procession reflected his local, regional and national standing, with fellow judges, six priests and representatives across all levels of society, including the military, led by his close friend fr J√≥zef Londzin.Dziennik ≈ölƒÖska Cieszy≈Ñskiego 1925, XXII#163, 2.Gwiazdka Cieszy≈Ñska 1925, 78#59, 2.

W≈Çadys≈Çaw and his wife Zofia had three daughters, El≈ºbieta, Janina and Irena, as well as a son, Edward, who completed a doctorate in law and worked as a notary in Czarny Dunajec. The only son of Alicja and Andrzej, Stanis≈Çaw Sylwester Alfonzy, was born on 4 November 1898 in Jab≈Çonk√≥w (now in the Czech Republic). As with his father and half-brother Bogus≈Çaw, church records show that Stanis≈Çaw's surname was changed from Kusionowicz to Grody≈Ñski on 7 September 1906. Following military service, during which he was wounded, then law studies at universities in Krak√≥w and Pozna≈Ñ, at the age of twenty-eight Stanis≈Çaw reputedly became Poland's youngest Starost ('Governor') at the time.Andrzej ST Grody≈Ñski 2012, 3-17.

It was constructed in Empire style after an initiative from Herman Wedel Jarlsberg. Gamle Logen was inaugurated in 1839 with King Karl Johan and Crown Prince Oscar as honorary guests. The main hall officially was opened in 1844 with a performance by the great Norwegian violinist Ole Bull. The hall has been centre stage for many historical and cultural events in the city of Oslo and played an important role in the development of the Norwegian cultural identity throughout the 19th century. Ole Bull is said to have discovered Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson and Henrik Ibsen there, it was Edvard Grieg's concert hall and Festpolonaise, Op.12 by Johann Svendsen was performed here in 1874. Gamle Logen was left to the city of Oslo when the freemasons built their present hall in 1898. The hall has since served for municipal meetings and for the town council of the city of Oslo. Archives and the chandeliers were lost during the German occupation of Norway (1940‚Äì45). The hall was neglected for many years after the end of World War II. The historical atmosphere has since been recreated. Reopened fully restored in 1988, the hall is once again a venue for concerts, banquets and balls.

His racing career consisted of a single race: a win in the 1825 Epsom Derby. Training problems prevented him from racing again, and he was retired undefeated to stud. He was exported to Russia in 1833. Background Middleton was a big, heavily built chestnut horse with a white blaze bred by his owner George Child Villiers, 5th Earl of Jersey at his stud at Middleton Stoney in Oxfordshire. His sire, Phantom won the Derby in 1811 and went on to be Champion sire on two occasions. Middleton‚Äôs dam, Web, was a half-sister of the Derby winner Whisker and became an extremely successful broodmare, her descendants including the Classic winners Glencoe, Cobweb (Epsom Oaks), Charlotte West (1000 Guineas) and Riddlesworth (2000 Guineas). Racing career Middleton was slow to mature and did not run as a two-year-old. In early 1825, however, he performed well in private trial races. Despite never having raced in public, he became the leading fancy for The Derby and was the subject of much heavy betting for the race, with Lord Jersey and the Duke of Wellington among the biggest gamblers. On the morning of the race, Middleton was the target of a plan by bookmakers to prevent him winning the race. A stable lad was bribed to allow the colt to drink several buckets of water, leaving him bloated. Edwards responded by giving Middleton a four-mile exercise walk after which he professed himself satisfied with the colt's condition. Middleton started at odds of 7/4 against seventeen opponents and won cleverly, from Rufus, with Hogarth third. Both Jersey and Wellington reportedly claimed over ¬£1,000 in winning bets. In autumn, Middleton was entered in several match races but did not run after either he or his opponent was withdrawn. Middleton began to suffer from Navicular Disease which caused chronic lameness. It proved impossible to run him again, and he was retired to stud with an unbeaten record. Stud career Middleton stood as a stallion at the Horse Bazaar, Portman Square, London, where he had little success. In 1833, he was sold and exported to Russia.

Held each year on the fourth weekend of August, the festival sprawls across Frog Island Park, Riverside Park, and historic Depot Town. The festival features a variety of activities and entertainment including helicopter rides, acrobats and theater performances by Ring of Steel, evening concerts, gambling and bingo, and a huge kids zone full of children specific activities and rides. Additionally there are featured evens like Illumination@YpsiFest where local business compete for prizes by creating illuminated sculptures for an evening display, and an illumination parade. History The festival was first held on Saturday, July 15, 1978, \\"from noon 'til nightfall\\". The sidewalks and streets in Depot Town had just been re-paved, and the Depot Town Association held a \\"Sidewalk Celebration\\". The poster advertised a noon sidewalk promenade led by the Honorable George Goodman \\"Hizzoner\\" the mayor of Ypsilanti and exciting ribbon cutting ceremonies, dedications and plain or fancy walkin. The Sidewalk Celebration was such a success that a decision was made to repeat the event, to be known as the \\"Ypsilanti Yesteryear Heritage Festival\\". According to other reports, a motivating factor was the desire to establish a historic district in Ypsilanti, to prevent the city from replacing historic buildings on North Huron Street and in Depot Town with new construction. A group of Ypsilantians applied to the state for funding to publish a guidebook to the city's historic homes, and were told that no money was available for that purpose, but that there was funding available to stage a festival. A $15,000 grant from the state helped to fund the 1979 Ypsilanti Yesteryear Heritage Festival. In 1979, the festival drew 50,000 attendees, continued to grow quickly in subsequent years, and the name was soon shortened to the present name. By the mid-1980s the festival was attracting attention from non-local newspapers ‚Äî a June 1985 edition of the Toledo Blade referred to it as an \\"Old time circus, arts and crafts, and historic home tour\\" ‚Äî and later that decade the festival was drawing more than 250,000 attendees a year, though attendance subsequently declined, and in recent years the festival has drawn about 100,000 attendees. 2020 saw officials cancel the 43rd on COVID-19 pandemic concerns. That was deferred to 2021. Activities Teams from Greenfield Village play a game of vintage base ball at the Ypsilanti Heritage Festival each year (2011 game pictured). The Ypsilanti Heritage Festival includes and has included a wide variety of activities and events. The Ypsilanti Historic Home Tour, held annually during the Ypsilanti Heritage Festival, began, like the festival proper, in 1979. A beer garden and gambling tent anchored the center of the festival from 1979 through 2010. In 2011 the gambling was eliminated for financial reasons, while the beer garden continued with an expanded food and drink selection; however, in January, 2012, new festival director Andrew Clock announced that \\"the casino will be back, set up right next to the beer tent, where it belongs.\\" A bed race through downtown Ypsilanti was added as an annual event beginning in 2009. The Ypsilanti Heritage Festival Parade began in 1979, and has been held every year. In 2007, the parade attracted wider attention when parade organizers approved the inclusion of a group protesting a proposed city income tax and subsequently revoked the permission. Festival coordinators explained that their rule was to exclude groups marching to represent controversial or political issues, and that the initial approval was an error. Because the Ypsilanti Heritage Festival has often been the same weekend as the Woodward Dream Cruise, festival coordinators \\"decided it would be a blast to have something that was the direct opposite of the Dream Cruise\\", and the Nightmare Cruise, a spoof of the Woodward Dream Cruise, was born in 2005. The only rules are that \\"[t]he car has to be legally driveable, and fluid leaks should be at a minimum.\\" Other events have included a pole vault competition sanctioned by USA Track & Field, live theater, antique cars and fire engines, vintage base ball sponsored by Greenfield Village, \\"Precious Pets\\" and \\"Beautiful Babies\\" contests, a rubber duck race, a living history encampment, a high wire performance by one of The Flying Wallendas, and a circus. \\"The Game That Never Was\\" In 1973, Carolyn King, with support from the Ypsilanti City Council, became one of the first girls in the country to play Little League Baseball. When they found out that she was playing, Little League International officials pulled the Ypsilanti American Little League's charter, and the 1973 All-Star game between the rival Ypsilanti American and National Little Leagues was never played. Thirty-seven years later, the teams were re-assembled (with the players now in their late forties) and the game was finally held, in Frog Island Park, as part of the 2010 festival. Billed as \\"The Game That Never Was\\", the American League All- Stars (led by Carolyn, who led off and played center field) won, 15-14.

She received a prime education, beffiting of her social status: she spoke English and French, and could play the piano.As Primeiras Damas da Rep√∫blica Portuguesa (1910-2005), edited by Museu da Presid√™ncia da Rep√∫blica (2005) She met her future husband, Manuel de Arriaga, in her hometown. They married in around 1870, in a chapel near Valen√ßa do Minho, where her father was General and Governor. For a few years the couple lived in Coimbra, where Manuel de Arriaga flourished in his law practice. Six children were born, two boys and four girls: Maria M√°xima de Melo Arriaga Brum da Silveira (born 20 February 1875), Manuel de Arriaga Brum da Silveira (born 24 March 1879), Maria Am√©lia de Melo Arriaga Brum da Silveira (born 8 February 1880), Maria Cristina de Arriaga (born 10 April 1882), Roque Manuel de Arriaga (born 18 March 1885), Maria Adelaide de Melo de Arriaga (born 11 April 1887). The family regularly spent their holidays in Buarcos. On 24 August 1911, her husband became the first President elect of the Portuguese Republic and, by extension, Lucr√©cia was made the first First Lady of the country, aged sixty-six. In spite of her pro-monarchy convictions, Lucr√©cia supported her husband, and moved with the family to Bel√©m Palace, where she was mostly dedicated to the home, per the \\"female habit\\" of the time. However, the First Lady avoided public exposure and the commemoration of the second anniversary of the Implantation of the Republic, in 1912, was one of the only occasions she took part in a public event. On 4 October 1913, she presided over an afternoon tea for the children of the National Press employees, having been received as the wife of the Head of State. The following day, on the third anniversary of the instauration of the Republican regime, she attended a play at Teatro Nacional de S√£o Carlos, but was not offered a seat in the presidential tribune. In November of that same year, she attended the \\"garden party\\" thrown by Manuel de Arriaga to the Brazilian sailors visiting Lisbon on occasion of the 23rd anniversary of the Brazilian Republic. After Manuel de Arriaga left the Presidency in 1915, Lucr√©cia was supportive of the Portuguese Women's Cruzade, in 1916. She died on 15 October 1927, in Parede.

Not long after graduating from Stafford Senior High School in 1983, he started working for Stride Rite, and where he became a regional vice president at the age of 25. From 1999 to 2004, Elsey was the president and CEO of Footwear Specialties International.

He also worked at EJ Footwear LLC (formerly known as the Endicott Johnson Corporation), Iron Age and Lake of the Woods. In 2000, Elsey was promoted to CEO/president of Nautilus Footwear. In March 2005, Elsey was named President of Kodiak-Terra USA Inc. He left Kodiak-Terra in April 2007 to work full time on Soles4Souls. Charity work In 2004 Elsey founded Soles4Souls, a nonprofit organization that sends shoes to recovering communities struck by natural disasters. Soles4Souls became one of the USA's fastest growing charities, but faced criticism over claims that a $1 donation would provide a pair of shoes to someone in need, since the used shoes they received were resold to wholesalers that then sold them to small businesses in developing countries instead of directly shipping them abroad. One shoe company donated new shoes but the charity resold them and they ended up sold in discount stores in the USA. In 2010, Elsey expanded Soles4Souls to Clothes4Souls and in 2011, he added Hope4Souls. In 2010, Elsey published his book Almost Isn‚Äôt Good Enough about his experience with nonprofit organizations. After leaving Soles4Souls, he started Elsey Enterprises, a branding and marketing company. During his tenure at Soles4Souls, he was accused of misusing charity funds for personal needs by borrowing $900,000 to refinance his personal property which was ruled illegal under Tennessee law. Elsey later repaid the money in full and refuted that he had mismanaged the funds, saying that he was safeguarding the funds during the economic downturn. In 2016, Elsey Enterprises acquired Shoes With Heart, a shoe drive fundraising business based in Southern California.

Species are listed by common name, scientific name, typical habitat and occurrence. The common and scientific names come from the American Society of Mammalogists' Wyoming Mammal List. Large and medium sized mammals Grizzly bear Order: Carnivora, Family: Ursidae Black bear Black bear Order: Carnivora, Family: Ursidae Occurrence: Forests, slide areas, alpine meadows The American black bear (Ursus americanus) is North America's smallest and most common species of bear. It is a generalist animal, being able to exploit numerous different habitats and foodstuffs. The American black bear is listed by the IUCN as being of least concern, due to the species widespread distribution and a large global population estimated to be twice that of all other bear species combined. Bighorn sheep Order: Artiodactyla, Family: Bovidae Occurrence: Open mountainous areas The bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) is a species of sheep in North America with large horns. The horns can weigh up to , while the sheep themselves weigh up to .Bighorn Sheep Recent genetic testing indicates that there are three distinct subspecies of Ovis canadensis, one of which is endangered: Ovis canadensis sierrae. American bison Bison Order: Artiodactyla, Family: Bovidae Occurrence: Eastside parklands and prairies The American bison (Bison bison) is a North American species of bison, also commonly known as the American buffalo. These bison once roamed the grasslands of North America in massive herds; their range roughly formed a triangle between the Great Bear Lake in Canada's far northwest, south to the Mexican states of Durango and Nuevo Le√≥n, and east along the western boundary of the Appalachian Mountains. Today these bison are much fewer in number, and travel only in small herds. Bobcat Order: Carnivora, Family: Felidae Occurrence: Open forests, brushy areas The bobcat (Lynx rufus) is a North American mammal of the cat family, Felidae. With twelve recognized subspecies, it ranges from southern Canada to northern Mexico, including most of the continental United States. The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas, as well as semi-desert, urban edge, forest edges and swampland environments. It persists in much of its original range and populations are healthy. Coyote Coyote Order: Carnivora, Family: Canidae Occurrence: Forests, grasslands The coyote ( or )coyote - Definitions from Dictionary.com (Canis latrans), also known as the American jackal or the prairie wolf,prairie wolf. The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001-07 is a species of canid found throughout North and Central America, ranging from Panama in the south, north through Mexico, the United States and Canada. It occurs as far north as Alaska and all but the northernmost portions of Canada. Elk Bull elk Order: Artiodactyla, Family: Cervidae Occurrence: Open forests, meadows, fields The elk or wapiti (Cervus canadensis) is one of the largest species of deer in the world and one of the largest mammals in North America and eastern Asia. In the deer family (Cervidae), only the moose, Alces alces (called an \\"elk\\" in Europe), is larger, and Cervus unicolor (the sambar deer) can rival the C. canadensis elk in size. Elk range in forest and forest-edge habitat, feeding on grasses, plants, leaves, and bark. Gray fox Order: Carnivora, Family: Canidae Occurrence: Deciduous forests, cottonwood riparian, basin-prairie shrublands, sagebrush-grasslands, riparian shrub, grasslands, agricultural areas, rock outcrops, roadside/railroad banks. The gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) ranges throughout most of the southern half of North America from southern Canada to the northern part of South America (Venezuela and Colombia). Gray wolf Gray wolf Order: Carnivora, Family: Canidae Occurrence: Coniferous forests The gray wolf (Canis lupus), often known simply as the wolf, is the largest wild member of the family Canidae. It is an ice age survivor originating during the Late Pleistocene around 300,000 years ago.Nowak, R. 1992. Wolves: The great travelers of evolution. International Wolf 2(4):3 - 7. DNA sequencing and genetic drift studies reaffirm that the gray wolf shares a common ancestry with the domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris). Although certain aspects of this conclusion have been questioned, the main body of evidence confirms it. A number of other gray wolf subspecies have been identified, though the actual number of subspecies is still open to discussion. Gray wolves are typically apex predators in the ecosystems they occupy. Canada lynx Order: Carnivora, Family: Felidae Occurrence: Coniferous forests The Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) is a North American mammal of the cat family, Felidae. It is a close relative of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). Some authorities regard both as conspecific. However, in some characteristics the Canadian lynx is more like the bobcat (Lynx rufus) than the Eurasian lynx. With the recognized subspecies, it ranges across Canada and into Alaska as well as some parts of the northern United States. Moose Moose Order: Artiodactyla, Family: Cervidae Occurrence: Coniferous forests, lakes, slow streams, marshy areas The moose (North America) or common European elk (Europe) (Alces alces) is the largest extant species in the deer family. Moose are distinguished by the palmate antlers of the males; other members of the family have antlers with a \\"twig-like\\" configuration. Moose typically inhabit boreal and mixed deciduous forests of the Northern Hemisphere in temperate to subarctic climates. Mountain goat Mountain goat Order: Artiodactyla, Family: Bovidae Occurrence: High peaks and meadows The mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus), also known as the Rocky Mountain goat, is a large- hoofed mammal found only in North America. Despite its vernacular name, it is not a member of Capra, the genus of true goats. It resides at high elevations and is a sure-footed climber, often resting on rocky cliffs that predators cannot reach. Mountain lion Order: Carnivora, Family: Felidae Occurrence: Coniferous forests The cougar (Puma concolor), also known as puma, mountain lion, mountain cat, catamount or panther, depending on the region, is a mammal of the family Felidae, native to the Americas. This large, solitary cat has the greatest range of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere, extending from Yukon in Canada to the southern Andes of South America. An adaptable, generalist species, the cougar is found in every major American habitat type. It is the second heaviest cat in the American continents after the jaguar. Although large, the cougar is most closely related to smaller felines. Mule deer Mule deer Order: Artiodactyla, Family: Cervidae Occurrence: Open forests, meadows, often at high elevations The mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) is a deer whose habitat is in the western half of North America. It gets its name from its large mule-like ears. Adult male mule deer are called bucks, adult females are called does, and young of both sexes are called fawns. The black-tailed deer is considered by some a distinct species though it is classified as a subspecies of the mule deer. Unlike its cousin, the white-tailed deer, mule deer are generally more associated with the land west of the Missouri River. The most noticeable differences between whitetails and mule deer are the color of their tails and configuration of their antlers. The mule deer's tail is black tipped. Pronghorn Order: Artiodactyla, Family: Antilocapridae Occurrence: Basin- prairie and mountain-foothills, shrublands, eastern great plains and great basin-foothills grasslands, sagebrush-grasslands The pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), is a species of artiodactyl mammal native to interior western and central North America. Though not a true antelope, it is often known colloquially in North America as the prong buck, pronghorn antelope or simply antelope,Caton, J. D. (1876). The American Antelope, or Prong Buck The American Naturalist 10 (4): 193‚Äì205. as it closely resembles the true antelopes of the Old World and fills a similar ecological niche due to convergent evolution.Farb, Peter (1970). Ecology. Time Life Books. pp. 126, 136 It is the only surviving member of the family Antilocapridae.Smithsonian Institution. North American Mammals: Pronghorn Antilocapra americana Red fox Red fox kits Order: Carnivora, Family: Canidae Occurrence: Grasslands, open forest The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is a small canid native to much of North America and Eurasia, as well as northern Africa. It is the most recognizable species of fox and in many areas it is referred to simply as \\"the fox\\". As its name suggests, its fur is predominantly reddish brown, but there is a naturally occurring gray morph known as the \\"silver\\" fox. The red fox is by far the most widespread and abundant species of fox, found in almost every single habitat in the Northern Hemisphere, from the coastal marshes of United States, to the alpine tundras of Tibetan Plateau. Swift fox Swift fox Order: Carnivora, Family: Canidae Occurrence: Short-grass prairies and deserts The swift fox (Vulpes velox) is a small light orange-tan fox around the size of a domestic cat found in the western grasslands of North America, such as Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. It also lives in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta in Canada, where it was previously extirpated. It is closely related to the kit fox and the two species are sometimes known as subspecies of Vulpes velox because hybrids of the two species occur naturally where their ranges overlap. The swift fox lives primarily in short-grass prairies and deserts. Due to predator control programs in the 1930s, it was considered extinct in Canada for some time, but reintroduction programs have been successful in reintroducing the species. Due to stable populations elsewhere, the species is considered by the IUCN to be of least concern. White-tailed deer White- tailed deer buck Order: Artiodactyla, Family: Cervidae Occurrence: Coniferous forests, meadows, creek and river bottoms The white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), also known as the Virginia deer, or simply as the whitetail, is a medium-sized deer native to the United States (all but five of the states), Canada, Mexico, Central America, and in South America as far south as Peru. The species is most common east of the Rocky Mountains, and is absent from much of the western United States, including Nevada, Utah, California, Hawaii, and Alaska (though its close relatives, the mule deer and black-tailed deer, can be found there). It does, however, survive in aspen parklands and deciduous river bottomlands within the central and northern Great Plains, and in mixed deciduous riparian corridors, river valley bottomlands, and lower foothills of the northern Rocky Mountain regions from Wyoming to southeastern British Columbia.

He received primary education there. At the age of 12, he began studying at the Uniate Gymnasium in Edirne. Shanov continued his education in Rome and in 1873 was ordained as a priest. Afterwards, Epiphany served in Thessaloniki, where he spent the next years of his life. After the recall of Lazar Mladenov on July 23, 1895, he became the Bishop of the Bulgarian Uniat Church in Macedonia and on September 8, 1895 in Istanbul he was granted the title Livadian Bishop and appointed as Apostolic vicar in Macedonia. Initially his office was in Kilkis. Bishop Epiphany Shanov supported the activities of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO). In 1903 in Macedonia, under his leadership, over 10,000 Uniates lived in 20 villages, 10 churches, 30 priests, including 13 boys' and 9 girls' schools. In 1909, Shanov resigned, but his resignation was not accepted by the Apostolic Delegate. Shanov remained head of the Bulgarian Uniate Church during the Balkan wars. In 1913, Greek soldiers arrested him and he went into exile first to the island of Naxos and then to Trikeri, where he remained until the First World War ended. Shanov was released in 1919 and retired to Kazanlak. In the late summer of 1921 he again asked the Pope in Rome to be released from his duties as Bishop of the Thessaloniki diocese. The Pope accepted his request and he retired to Kazanlak, where he died in 1940.

Yamaji was born in Tosa Domain (present day K≈çchi Prefecture) in what is now part of the city of K≈çchi, where his father was an upper-ranked samurai in the service of the Yamauchi clan. At the age of 13, he lost sight in one of his eyes, but notwithstanding his disability, he was appointed a company commander of the Jinshotai, a Tosa-Domain shock force, during the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, participating in the Battle of Toba‚ÄìFushimi, and in subsequent campaigns in northern Japan against the pro- Tokugawa ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei. During the course of the conflict, he was promoted to company commander, and awarded a stipend of 150 koku. After the war, Yamaji went to Tokyo, and was appointed by the Meiji government as a lieutenant colonel in the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army. During the Seikanron debate, he supported his fellow Tosa clansmen Itagaki Taisuke and Got≈ç Sh≈çjir≈ç, at one point resigning his commission and returning to Tosa to participate in the Freedom and People's Rights Movement, but eventually he had a falling out with Itagaki and returned to military service, receiving a position with the Guards Division. During the Satsuma Rebellion Yamaji commanded the IJA 4th Infantry Regiment from March to October 1877, served as chief of staff of the IJA 3rd Infantry Brigade and subsequently commanded the IJA 3rd Infantry Regiment and IJA 12th Infantry Regiment. As general Yamaji was promoted to the rank of major general in February 1881, and commander of the Kumamoto Garrison. He subsequently served as commander of the Osaka Garrison, IJA 2nd Infantry Brigade, Kumamoto Garrison (second term), and was promoted to lieutenant general in December 1886. In May 1887, he was elevated to the title of baron (danshaku) in the kazoku peerage system by Emperor Meiji. In May 1888, with the reorganization of the Imperial Japanese Army into divisions per the advice of Prussian military advisor Jakob Meckel, Yamaji was made commander of the new IJA 6th Division, and later of the IJA 1st Division. During the First Sino-Japanese War, he saw combat at the Battle of Jinzhou and later at the Battle of Lushunkou. After the fall of Lushunkou, soldiers under his command were accused of the Port Arthur massacre by yellow journalist James Creelman in a widely circulated account with blemished Japan's previous good reputation for its conduct in the war. Yamaji is reported to have brought two camels back from Lushunkou as spoils of war. He presented one to the crown prince (the future Emperor Taish≈ç) and the other to Ueno Zoo in Tokyo. Sh≈´kan Post.

The Thrill Book was a U.S. pulp magazine published by Street & Smith in 1919. It was intended to carry \\"different\\" stories: this meant stories that were unusual or unclassifiable, which in practice often meant the stories were fantasy or science fiction. The first eight issues, edited by Harold Hersey, were a mixture of adventure and weird stories. Contributors included Greye La Spina, Charles Fulton Oursler, J. H. Coryell, and Seabury Quinn. Hersey was replaced by Ronald Oliphant with the July1 issue, probably because Street & Smith were unhappy with his performance. Oliphant printed more science fiction and fantasy than Hersey had done, though this included two stories by Murray Leinster which Hersey had purchased before being replaced. The most famous story from The Thrill Book is The Heads of Cerberus, a very early example of a novel about alternative time tracks, by Francis Stevens. Oliphant was given a larger budget than Hersey, and was able to acquire material by popular writers such as H. Bedford-Jones, but he was able to produce only eight more issues before the end came. The last issue was dated October 15, 1919; the magazine was probably cancelled because of poor sales, although a printers' strike at that time may have been a factor. Although The Thrill Book has been described as the first American pulp to specialize in fantasy and science fiction, this description is not supported by recent historians of the field, who regard it instead as a stepping stone on the path that ultimately led to Weird Tales and Amazing Stories, the first true specialized magazines in the fields of weird fiction and science fiction respectively. Publication history Cover of the July 15 issue; artwork by Charles DurantBleiler (1991), p. 250. In the late 19th century, popular magazines typically did not print fiction to the exclusion of other content; they would include non-fiction articles and poetry as well. In October 1896, the Frank A. Munsey company's Argosy magazine was the first to switch to printing only fiction, and in December of that year, it switched to using cheap wood-pulp paper. This is now regarded by magazine historians as having been the start of the pulp magazine era. For twenty years, pulp magazines were successful without restricting their fiction content to any specific genre, but in 1915 the influential magazine publisher Street & Smith began to issue titles that focused on a particular niche, such as Detective Story Magazine and Western Story Magazine, thus pioneering the specialized and single-genre pulps.Murray (2011), p. 11. In the midst of these changes, some time in 1918, Street & Smith's circulation manager, Henry Ralston, decided to launch a new magazine to publish \\"different\\" stories: \\"different\\" meant stories that were unusual or unclassifiable in some way, which in most cases meant they included either fantasy or science fiction elements.Bleiler (1991), pp. 4‚Äì5. In The Fiction Factory, Quentin Reynolds' history of Street & Smith, Reynolds asserts that the magazine was the brainchild of Ormond G. Smith, one of the publishers, but pulp historian Will Murray regards this as unlikely to be the full story, given that Reynolds' book was written almost forty years later and was an \\"approved\\" history. Murray asserts that Ralston was certainly involved in the creation of The Thrill Book. Walter Adolphe Roberts, the editor of Street & Smith's Ainslee's Magazine, told a friend of his, Harold Hersey, that Ralston was looking for an editor for a new magazine. Hersey had sold some writing to the pulps but his editorial experience was limited to no more than a year's work on several little magazines.Bleiler (1991), p. 4. He met with Ralston in early 1919 and was immediately hired on the basis of the interview. It is possible that Eugene A. Clancy, the editor of Street & Smith's The Popular Magazine, was originally intended to be the editor of The Thrill Book, but was unable to take on the additional work, though Clancy did assist Hersey on some issues of The Thrill Book.Murray (2011), pp. 11‚Äì16. Bringing Hersey on as editor was unfortunate; historians of the field describe Hersey as lacking talent both as a writer and as an editor.Hulse (2013), p. 218.Murray (2011), pp. 13‚Äì15.Bleiler (1991), p. 2. The first issue of The Thrill Book was dated March 1, 1919, and was published in a format similar to that of a dime novel. The choice of format was probably a mistake, as it was associated in the minds of the buying public with low-quality fiction aimed at readers with very low standards.Bleiler (1991), p. 7. The plan to publish twice a month indicated that Street & Smith were confident the new magazine would be successful. With the ninth issue, dated July 1, 1919, Hersey was replaced by Ronald Oliphant.Bleiler (1991), p. 10. The reason he was replaced is not clear, though several explanations have been suggested. Murray Leinster claimed Hersey was fired for publishing too much of his own fiction and poetry in the magazine; according to Leinster, some of the poetry may have actually been written by Hersey's mother rather than by Hersey himself. Pulp historian Richard Bleiler regards this theory as unlikely, since although up to eighteen of the twenty-five short poems in the first eight issues of the magazine may have been by Hersey, only two stories in those issues are definitely by him, and there are only four other stories which may have been Hersey's work published under a pseudonym. Bleiler suggests that at most Street & Smith would have reprimanded Hersey and that the real reason for his dismissal is more likely to be that Street & Smith were dissatisfied with The Thrill Book under his editorship. Bleiler also suggests Hersey may have started the rumor that he was let go for buying too much of his own material, as this would have been less harmful to his reputation than a dismissal for failure.Bleiler (1991), pp. 10‚Äì13. Hersey himself claimed he was not fired, but quit: \\"I wasn't fired, but I should have been ... I saw the 'handwriting on the wall' ahead of time. I asked to be relieved of my duties ... and my request was promptly accepted!\\" At the same time Oliphant was appointed editor, the layout of the magazine was changed to that of a standard pulp. At 160 pages, this offered readers much better value for money than the 48-page dime novel format of the first eight issues, even with a price increase from 10 to 15 cents. A question and answer department, \\"Cross-Trails\\", was begun, in imitation of a similar feature in Adventure, the most successful pulp magazine of the day, and the format change may also have been done to increase the resemblance of the two magazines, along with a change to the appearance of The Thrill Book's contents page to resemble that of Adventure.Bleiler (1991), pp. 13‚Äì15. Street & Smith cancelled the magazine after the sixteenth issue, dated October 15. A printers' strike has often been suggested as the reason, though Hersey denied it in his reminiscences, and it is clear that poor sales were at least part of the reason for the cancellation. Stories were still being acquired for the magazine by Street & Smith in November, and since the final issue would have appeared on newsstands some time in September, this implies that the magazine went on hiatus (possibly because of the printers' strike) with the expectation of returning, perhaps on a less frequent schedule. A note in Street & Smith's files records the cancellation date as December 1, 1919, which may indicate the point at which the delay caused by the strike convinced Street & Smith to finally kill the magazine.Murray (2011), pp. 19‚Äì20. Contents and reception The cover of the first issue, dated March 1, 1919. The artwork, by Sidney H. Riesenberg, is \\"shabby and second-rate\\", according to Richard Bleiler. Hersey began by making himself familiar with the work of writers already in the market who were capable of producing the kind of material Ralston wanted. He soon concluded that the new magazine would have to include some reprinted stories alongside the original material. The budget did not permit Hersey to pay rates that would attract top-quality writers, nor even to reprint the best-known stories of the kind he was looking for, and he was forced to use relatively unknown authors such as Perley Poore Sheehan and Robert W. Sneddon. Hersey distributed a \\"Notice to Writers\\" that described what he was looking for: \\"strange, bizarre, occult, mysterious tales ... mystic happenings, weird adventures, feats of leger-de-main, spiritualism, et cetera ... If you have an idea which you have considered too bizarre to write, too weird or strange, let us see it.\\" This did not restrict the submissions to fantasy or science fiction, and as a result, Hersey received (and printed) all kinds of fiction, including mysteries, adventures, and love stories,Murray (2011), p. 15. though it may be that he simply did not receive enough good quality science fiction and fantasy to fill the magazine.Ashley (2000), pp. 37‚Äì40. Hersey later recalled that the notice did not bring in many usable manuscripts: \\"As a result of the notices in the writers' magazines, I received a thousand manuscripts but was able to buy only ten!\\" The first issue included \\"Wolf of the Steppes\\", a werewolf story by Greye La Spina. This had been submitted to The Popular Magazine but purchased by Clancy for The Thrill Book in 1918, when Street & Smith began making plans for the new magazine. The story was the first by La Spina, whose real name was Fanny Greye Bragg; she would go on to publish several more stories in The Thrill Book, and later became a regular contributor to Weird Tales.Murray (2011), p. 16. Another first story was \\"The Thing That Wept\\", by Charles Fulton Oursler, who later went on to edit Liberty and to write novels under the name Anthony Abbot.Blottner (2011), p. 293.Bleiler (1991), p. 34. Two serials were begun in the first issue: \\"The Jeweled Ibis\\" by J.C. Kofoed, and \\"In the Shadows of Race\\", by J. Hampton Bishop. Both contained enough fantastic or science-fictional elements to fit the original plans for the magazine: \\"The Jeweled Ibis\\" was about worshippers of the ancient Egyptian gods, and Bishop's story was about a lost race in Africa, and included intelligent apes. The cover for the first issue was by Sidney H. Riesenberg; Bleiler describes it as \\"shabby and second-rate\\" by comparison to cover art in successful magazines of the day such as Adventure and Detective Story Magazine.Bleiler (1991), pp. 6‚Äì7. The May1 issue included an early short story by Seabury Quinn, \\"The Stone Image\\", which features a character named Dr. Towbridge, who would later appear (renamed Dr. Trowbridge) in Quinn's popular occult detective stories about Jules de Grandin, though Quinn had not yet invented de Grandin. Tod Robbins, a well-regarded writer of fantasy, supplied several short pieces, all \\"shallow mood sketches\\" without much substance, in the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley. The contributors included Sophie Louise Wenzel, who later published stories in Weird Tales under the name Sophie Wenzel Ellis, but most of the writers from Hersey's editorship, such as George C. Jenks and John R. Coryell‚Äîboth authors of dime novels‚Äîare no longer well-known names. When Oliphant took over the editorship, he placed notices in writers' magazines looking for more submissions.Bleiler (1991), pp. 6, 16. Much of the material published under Oliphant's editorship would have been bought by Hersey, making it hard to judge Oliphant's impact.Murray (2011), p. 17. However, it is clear that Oliphant bought more science fiction and fantasy stories than Hersey had done: in particular, Hersey had published almost no stories that were straightforward science fiction, though two he did purchase, Murray Leinster's \\"A Thousand Degrees Below Zero\\" and \\"The Silver Menace\\", appeared in the first few issues of Oliphant's editorship. Stories such as \\"The Lost Days\\" by Trainor Lansing, which dealt with perceptions of time, and \\"The Ultimate Ingredient\\" by Greye La Spina, about invisibility, published in August and October respectively, were more evidence of this change in emphasis. The most famous science fiction to appear in The Thrill Book was Francis Stevens' novel The Heads of Cerberus, which was one of the earliest fictional depictions of alternate timelines.Murray (2011), p. 19. In addition to increasing the science fiction content, Oliphant also brought in authors who were better known than those published under Hersey's editorship, including H. Bedford- Jones and William Wallace Cook. It seems likely that the fiction budget increased when Oliphant took control, and he used this to pay higher word- rates to the better writers. Hersey had paid about a cent per word for fiction, but Bedford-Jones received $800 for \\"The Opium Ship\\", which was a rate of between 2.5 and 3cents per word. However, Francis Stevens was paid only $400, or less than a cent per word, for the much longer novel The Heads of Cerberus.Bleiler (1991), p. 15. Poetry continued to appear, including several more poems by Hersey, and also including \\"Dissonance\\" by Clark Ashton Smith, whom Hersey had contacted in March asking for submissions in what Will Murray describes as \\"a rare instance of Hersey's editorial foresight\\". left When The Thrill Book ceased publication, Street & Smith had numerous manuscripts in inventory that had been purchased for the magazine. These were offered to other Street & Smith magazines such as Sea Stories over the next few years. Greye La Spina bought back her manuscript to \\"The Dead Wagon\\" in 1927 and re-sold it to Weird Tales. Francis Stevens had sold three serials and three short stories to The Thrill Book that remained unpublished: one of the serials, Serapion, was published in Argosy in 1920, but the fate of the other two is not known‚Äîthey may have been earlier titles for known works of hers. The three short stories are not known to have been published elsewhere. In 1940, John L. Nanovic, the editor of Doc Savage and The Shadow, reviewed the remaining Thrill Book manuscripts, and suggested to Ralston that a few stories might be publishable in Love Story Magazines. He also suggested a few stories that John W. Campbell might be interested in for Unknown. The following year, Oliphant reviewed ten of the manuscripts and returned them to Nanovic with his recommendations. Campbell reviewed three of them and declined to take any; he also declined to take Murray Leinster's \\"The Great Catastrophe\\", which had been submitted to The Thrill Book and found independently of Nanovic's review. Other magazines that considered and rejected the stories Oliphant recommended included Clues, Mystery, and Detective Story Magazine.Murray (2011), pp. 22‚Äì24. The only story from The Thrill Book's inventory that was used from this review was Clyde Broadwell's \\"The Speed Demon's Vendetta\\", which was rewritten and published in The Avenger in March 1942 under the pseudonym \\"Denby Brixton\\", which Broadwell had used for a story he had sold to The Thrill Book.Bleiler (1991), pp. 72‚Äì73.Murray (2011), pp. 24‚Äì25. In 1976 the manuscripts were reviewed again by Will Murray. By this time they had been donated to Syracuse University by Cond√© Nast, which had acquired Street & Smith in 1961. The ten stories reviewed by Oliphant were found and plans were made for Odyssey Publications to publish a paperback edition of Thrill Book material including these stories along with some reprints. The following year another group of Thrill Book manuscripts was found in the Syracuse collection, including Leinster's \\"The Great Catastrophe\\" and La Spina's \\"The Bracelet\\", and the planned contents of the anthology were revised to include some of this material. None of the Francis Stevens stories were found in either group of manuscripts. One story, \\"As It Is Written\\", by De Lysle Ferree Cass, was misidentified by Murray as the work of Clark Ashton Smith, and this led to delays in publication as Odyssey made separate plans to publish the story under Smith's name. The misidentification was not discovered until after the story appeared in print in 1982. Four years later, Odyssey went out of business, and the anthology of Thrill Book material never appeared.Murray (2011), pp. 25‚Äì26. Because The Thrill Book was sold only in selected parts of the US, copies of the magazine are very scarce and are highly prized by pulp magazine collectors.Murray (2011), p. 26. Despite its rarity, or perhaps because of it, it has been often described as the first science fiction and fantasy magazine ever published, though more recent assessments by science fiction and pulp historians agree instead that the magazine was a failed attempt at specialization. In the words of Will Murray, the view that The Thrill Book is the first such magazine is \\"erroneously held by many\\", and he adds that it was \\"merely a prologue to the Golden Era of periodical weird fiction\\". In Murray's opinion it might well have become a dominant force in the genre had it continued publication. Richard Bleiler comments that \\"it was a magazine that somehow became a symbol to a generation of pulp readers ... it was the first eidetic flash of a dream that would later come into being with Weird Tales\\",Bleiler (1991), p. 20. and in Mike Ashley's opinion it was just \\"a step towards a full-blown fantasy magazine\\". Bibliographic details The Thrill Book was published by Street & Smith. Initially, the magazine was saddle-stapled, in by 8in, 48 pages long, and priced at 10 cents. This changed with the ninth issue, dated July 1, 1919, to pulp format, with 160 pages, priced at 15 cents. The editor was Harold Hersey from March1 to June 15, and Ronald Oliphant thereafter.Ashley (1985), pp. 661‚Äì664. There were eight issues to the first volume, six in the second, and two in the third and final volume.Bleiler (1991), pp. 49‚Äì50. Hersey later recalled that he had heard of a Thrill Book Quarterly being issued, but no evidence of such a magazine has been found.Murray (2011), p. 20. Two issues of The Thrill Book have been reprinted in facsimile editions, both by Wildside Press: the September 1, 1919, issue, published in 2005, and the first issue, March 1, 1919, which appeared in 2011.

During the Qing dynasty, it was considered one of the eight great temples of Yangzhou. The temple is situated in a semi-rural setting about 7 km south of downtown Yangzhou, on the western shore of the Old ChannelIn Yangzhou, there are two Grand Canal channels. The Old Channel runs through the city center, while the new channel, used by modern ships, is a few kilometers to the east. of the Grand Canal of China, just south of its junction with the Yizheng-Yangzhou Canal.  History  Gaomin temple was first built in the Sui dynasty, and achieved its largest area in the Qing dynasty, when it was expanded twice. In 1651, Tianzhong Tower was built, as well as a temple next to it called the Tower Temple. During the Kangxi Emperor's (r. 1661‚Äì1722) stay in the temple in his fourth southern tour, he climbed on Zhongtian Tower, overlooking the scenery, which was very beautiful and vast. Then named the temple for Gaomin Temple. 42 years after the Kangxi Emperor was enthroned (1703), Towerbaypalace (Chinese name: Â°îÊπæË°åÂÆ´) was built in west of Gaomin Temple. During the Kangxi Emperor's fifth southern tour, his palace's area was much bigger than Gaomin Temple, and they were separated by high walls. At that time, Gaomin Temple, Zhenjiang's Jinshan Temple, Chengdu's Geyuan Temple and Xindu's Baoguang Temple were known as the greatest four Zen temples. During the Kangxi era, there were five halls in it to worship Buddha, and pavilions(Chinese:Á¢ëÂæ°‰∫≠) on the left and right. Behind it, there was Gold Buddha hall, behind which Zhongtian Tower stood. Unluckily, they were all destroyed in the Daoguang and Xianfeng eras. Then in the Tongzhi and Guangxu eras, they were rebuilt, with an installation of two- layer Yushu Building. During Monk Laiguo's chairing the temple, he got rid of the old disadvantages and regressed to the old system, which made a great achievement. The pagodas, halls, Zen rooms, Yanshou Tang were rebuilt, that made Gaomin Temple take shape. After 1949, Gaomin was used and managed by Buddhists. However, during the Cultural Revolution, it was occupied by the Red Guard. They dismantled the halls and fixed other buildings, setting the temple on the verge of waste. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the policy of religious freedom was implemented. In 1983, Gaomin Temple was listed as one of the key Han national temples. After the efforts of the relevant departments, Gaomin temple was handed over to the Buddhists. In recent years, Gaomin Temple steps to rebuild temples with the foundings. With Hong Kong Buddhists' donations, Gaomin Temple's new Zen halls held an opening ceremony in November 1989.  Layout  In the Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1912) Gaomin Temple and the palace's area was larger than now. The palace, located in the center, covered fourth fifths of the area, whereas the temple, which lay east of the palace, occupied only one fifth.

M-Cubed was launched as a secondary payload to the Suomi NPP satellite, along with AubieSat-1, DICE-1, DICE-2, Explorer-1 Prime, and RAX-2. M-Cubed, short for Michigan Multipurpose Minisat, was designed as a technology demonstrator for a new FPGA-based image processing system intended for a future NASA mission, Aerosol-Cloud-Ecosystem, recommended by the Earth Science Decadal Survey. The mission was also intended to validate the satellite bus design for use in future cubesat missions. The satellite uses a passive magnetorquer for attitude control, consisting of a large permanent magnet that aligns the satellite with the Earth's magnetic field. On-board control is provided by a Taskit Stamp9G20 microcontroller running Real time Linux. Following launch, MXL was unable to command M-Cubed, and observed anomalies in its transmitted data. MXL concluded that the M-Cubed CubeSat became magnetically conjoined to Explorer-1 [Prime], a second CubeSat released at the same time, via both satellites' attitude control magnets.

Belha Devi Temple is another Shakti temple situated in Pratapgarh district of Uttar Pradesh state of India. The name of the city Bela (now called Bela Pratapgarh or Pratapgarh) is derived from Maa Belha Devi. This temple is dedicated to city's patron Goddess Belha Bhavani. Mata Belha Devi Temple at Pratapgarh is a symbol of Hindu culture and faith. The shrine located on the bank of Sai river is an epitome of age old tradition of Shakti worship in northern India. Belha Devi being the abode of Shiva and his consort ‚Äôshakti‚Äô became centre of shakti worship. However, the present temple which stands a witness to the exciting past of the Pratapgarh region is about two hundred years old. The archeological treasures unearthed from uttar pradesh region throw eloquent light on the history and culture of the area from the prehistoric to the recent times. Although owing to the onslaught of times and climes many tangible realities of the cultural manifestations of the region have been lost in the oblivion, yet there are certain things which never die out. One such reality is the Belha Devi Shrine and the tradition of shaktism practised in this part of the country, where the past has been rejuvenated for sustaining one of the living traditions of shaktism in India.  History  Raja Pratap Bhahadur Singh of Awadh constructed the present main temple of Shri Belha Devi, which is situated on the bank of Sai river in District Pratapgarh, during the period 1811‚Äì15. This temple had the patronage of Awadh State. The raja of Pratapgarh appointed pujari as \\"Pujari Name\\" of this temple whose duty was to worship the deity of the temple. After the merger of princely State into district these pujaris became independent on the matter of controlling and managing the affairs of the temple and the land attached to the temple. They are maintaining this temple and providing necessary facilities to the visiting devotees and thus the condition of the temple progressed day by day. So much so that there were proper arrangements for pilgrims visiting the temple during Navaratra melas.  About the deity  In the sanctum sanatorium Belha Devi is worshiped in the form of pindi (stone pebbles). Originally the pindis were only worshiped by the devotees. However, in modern times a marble bust of the deity was got sculpted for giving an attractive human look (form) to the deity. The Goddess is beautifully decorated with crown and other ornaments. In the sanatorium the Devi is worshiped in its anthropomorphic form sculpted on marble. The bust is enshrined in a silver-plated small vaulted shrine showing a beautiful decoration of silver embossing works throughout the body of the miniature vaulted shrine. Here also the pindi (stone) is worshiped along with the marble bust.  Darshan timing  The temple remains open from 4am to 10pm in the summer and from 5am to 9pm in the winter. Everybody can have Darshan during this period by entering from main gate. There is a separate gate for exit. Red Stone Pavement of size 75‚Äô √ó 105‚Äô has been provided in front of Shakti Dhwaj where devotees wait for their turn. Brass railing from Shakti Dhwaj to Ardh Mandap has been laid so that devotees may enter the temple in two queues and have easy Darshan without any difficulty of rush. The devotees are allowed to bring packed parshad in the mandir. The Parshad so offered by the devotees is placed in the feet of the deity and returned to the devotees. Offering in kind is poured in the Dan Pater placed in front of each temple.

Before that, he was Assistant Professor of Development Economics at the University of Bologna, Professor of Economics at the University of Catania, Professor of Economic Policy at the High Institute of Public Administration in Rome and Professor of Regional and Location Economics at the Universities of Venice and Rome. Leon studied law at Sapienza University of Rome and was a research student (1959) at King's College, Cambridge, where he was tutored by Richard Kahn. Between 1961 and 1968, he worked as an economist at the World Bank and left as Division Chief of the Economics Department. On returning to Italy, he worked as a consultant for a number of engineering firms, founded two private research companies (ARPES, 1970‚Äì1981, and CLES, 1982 to present) and was involved in benefit cost analysis of environment, cultural, training projects, studies of industrial districts and labor market analysis. He has been an expert for the European Union on many occasions and is editor of the journal Economia della Cultura. Much of his work in applied economics was based on criticizing the U-turn in economics brought about by the policies of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. He consulted central and regional governments, primarily on labor market regulations and showing that supply side policies in situations of deficient effective demand caused slow growth, useless government spending and increasing public debt.  Main publications  His theoretical work started with articles and a book in Italian which was later translated into English (Structural Change and Growth in Capitalism) and much appreciated by Joan Robinson: the main point it made was that a dynamic economy does not exhibit uniform profit rates, because sectors do not grow uniformly (due to Engel‚Äôs law and technical progress) and the capital needs of growing sectors necessarily imply higher profit rates than those of less dynamic sectors. Later, he published L‚Äôeconomia della domanda effettiva (The Economics of Effective Demand) to show that it was the economy as a whole that determined agents‚Äô behavior, rather than the other way around, with reflections on how enterprises were influenced, in the division of their functions, by changes in the macroeconomy (the macrofoundations of microeconomics). His latest work (Stato, Mercato e Collettivit√† ‚Äì The State, the Market and the Community) has tried to establish the nature of the State as the agent of society (or of the community). The idea that markets can substitute the government, by limiting its activities to minimal tasks (defense, justice, police) and that economic policies are useless, does not square with the macrofoundation of microeconomics: no expectation is so rational as to take account of Kahn and Leontief multipliers, all counterintuitive macroeconomic laws.

Bois des Buttes was a battle honour uniquely awarded to the Devonshire Regiment in memory of the actions of its 2nd Battalion on 27 May 1918, the first day of the Third Battle of the Aisne in the Great War.Baker, A.H.R (1986). Battle Honours of the British and Commonwealth Armies. Shepperton: Ian Allan. p. 128.  Prelude  The 2nd Devonshires were part of the 8th Infantry Division which had been severely depleted by the Spring fighting and had, on 12 May, been attached to General Duch√™ne's French Sixth Army and sent to a quiet sector to recuperate and rebuild.The Keep Military Museum: Battle of Bois des Buttes They were taken out of the line on May 20 and assigned to the reserve at Roucy for training of newly arrived replacement drafts. On 26 May, it was learned from captured German prisoners that an attack was due early the next morning, although there was little indication of the magnitude of what was to come. Late that afternoon, the battalion was ordered to occupy positions on Bois des Buttes, a wooded sandstone hill southwest of La Ville-aux-Bois that had been fortified by both the French and the Germans over the previous years. In addition to its surface fortifications, the hill was criss-crossed with creutes‚Äîunderground quarries whose galleries were dry, impervious to shellfire and, in many cases, electrically lit, and in which the troops took shelter.Souterrains & Vestiges: Sous le bois des buttesVisiting the Chemin des Dames: 2nd Bn Devonshire Regiment at Pontavert 1918 Positioned approximately 1200 yards behind the front line, the battalion was to be Brigade Reserve for the 23rd Infantry Brigade. The battalion completed the four-and-a-half mile march from Roucy and reported to Brigade Headquarters that it was in position by midnight.  The German assault  An hour later, at 0100 hours, the opening bombardment of Bl√ºcher-Yorck began, augmented with poison gas and described as 'of a violence and accuracy that in the opinion of the most seasoned soldiers far outdid any other barrage they were under'.Rogerson, Sidney (1937). The Last of the Ebb. London: Arthur Barker. p. 109 Sheltered as they were in dugouts deep underground, the Devons' casualties were light, although the gas caused some discomfort and inconvenience, and ammunition parties could not be sent out. At approximately 0345, the German infantry attack began using the recently developed Stormtroop tactic of advancing rapidly, probing for weak spots and avoiding pockets of resistance. The units in the front-line trenches, which had already suffered severely from the artillery bombardment, were rapidly infiltrated and overrun.This was exacerbated by Duch√™ne's policy of concentrating all his troops in front-line trenches, rather than defence in depth. Soon the 8th Division's only cohesive unit of any size north of the River Aisne was the 2nd Devonshires. At first light, around 0400 hours, the battalion emerged from the dugouts and took up its battle positions. Much of the trenchwork had been destroyed by the artillery bombardment, as had the field telephones, so that, when companies were sent to their battle positions, contact with their battalion headquarters was lost. Runners sent to attempt to re-establish contact were all too frequently killed by the continuing artillery fire. Despite this, several determined attacks by units of the German 50th Infantry Division were beaten off. Furthermore, the Devons were able to rake the road from La Ville-aux-Bois to Pontavert with fire, severely disrupting the flow of German reinforcements, supplies and ammunition, upon which the Germans were dependent for continued success.The Keep Military Museum: The Battle of Bois des Buttes‚ÄìBattlefield Tour It soon became apparent to the Germans that Bois des Buttes had become a significant obstacle to their progress, so that it came under attack from both A7V tanks and the Imperial German Army Air Service.  The Last Stand of the 2nd Devons  The Last Stand of the 2nd Devons by William Barnes Wollen. By 0700 hours the forward companies had been all but wiped out and the battalion surrounded. At 0830 the battalion commander, Lt Col Anderson-Morshead, withdrew the remains of his headquarters company and reserve company to the reverse slope of the hill, from where they continued to harass the advancing Germans. At 0930 hours, German troops, including artillery, were seen advancing from Juvincourt in the direction of Pontavert. Col Anderson-Morshead divided the 50 survivors of the battalion into two groups and moved them from the hill down to the Juvincourt- Pontavert road to engage the advancing Germans on two flanks. The Germans were initially thrown into confusion and an artillery team was destroyed, but they soon recovered and attacked in force. More Germans attacked from the hill that the Devonshires had so recently left, and Col Anderson-Morshead was killed. Short of ammunition and greatly outnumbered, the survivors conducted a fighting withdrawal to the Aisne river. Some were captured when they ran out of ammunition, others swam the Aisne and were captured by Germans who had reached the south bank before them. In all, 29 officers and 552 other ranks of the 2nd Battalion, the Devonshire Regiment, were killed or captured that morning.Including their commanding officer, a major, adjutant, 7 captains or company commanders, 5 lieutenants and 14 2nd lieutenants. See Rogerson, Sidney (1937). The Last of the Ebb. London: Arthur Barker. p. 116 Between 40 and 80 survivors managed to cross the Aisne river and canal and rejoin the retreating British forces.

Parentage William Stone was born on September 4, 1842 in East Machias, Maine. He was the son of Laura Poor Stone, an early anti slavery activist, and Thomas Treadwell Stone, a prominent Unitarian pastor, fiery abolitionist, and Transcendentalist. William's great grandfather, Thomas Treadwell, fought as a minuteman at Bunker Hill.Thomas T. Stone letter to his brother, August 23, 1894, Bolton Mass. Historical Soc. Laura Poor Stone's brother, Henry Varnum Poor, was one of the founders of the financial rating firm, Standard and Poor's. Early life William spent his early boyhood in Salem, Massachusetts, and later in Bolton, Massachusetts, to which his family relocated after his father's militant anti-slavery sermons led his resentful Salem parishioners to reject him.First Church Salem Website http://www.firstchurchinsalem.org/ministers-23.html The Stone family finances were largely exhausted by Harvard University educations for William's two older brothers. William, however, took full advantage of the limited educational resources available in a small New England town. During this period he adopted strong anti-slavery views of his own. He became a consummate diarist beginning with a boyhood diary in 1858, continuing with a detailed wartime diary 1861 through 1865, and concluding with a comprehensive journal of his key role in reconstruction of the post-war South 1866-1868.William Stone diaries and journals, Stone Family Archives His interest in the greater world in which he lived is typified by a letter to his father in late 1860 in which he predicted Lincoln's election as president. His 18-year-old crystal ball proved murky, however, when in the same letter he predicted with all the assurance of youthful bravado that the \\"fire eaters of South Carolina\\" would never follow through on their threat to secede if Lincoln were elected.William Stone \\"To My Dear Father\\" November 21, 1860, Stone Family Archives.

After sustaining a severe wound at Antietam, he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant. Following his third wound at Gettysburg, he was posted to an administrative position in Philadelphia.William Stone Wartime Diary, Stone Family Archives Freedmen's Bureau Service At the close of the war in 1865, Stone elected to stay in the army. In early 1866, now a brevet Major, he was assigned to the newly created Freedmen's Bureau. Designed by Congress to bridge the gap between slavery and citizenship for some four million largely illiterate African Americans, the Bureau represented America's first great social engineering project. As an agent of the Bureau in South Carolina, Stone struggled (against the violent resistance of the planter class and the Ku Klux Klan) to achieve the Bureau's objectives of education, equality in the courts, and fair labor standards for the newly freed slaves. He frequently presided over provost courts to ensure fair treatment of freedmen in legal disputes, and was instrumental in establishing schools for children of former slaves in his part of South Carolina.Bitter Freedom, William Stone's Record of Service in the Freedmen's Bureau, University of South Carolina Press 2008 Marriage and Children In 1869, Major Stone married Mary Taylor, a Quaker from Pennsylvania who had been assigned by the Society of Friends to teach black children in South Carolina. They proceeded to have two sons, Alfred and Herbert (who went on to become editor and publisher of Yachting and who was instrumental in re-establishing the Bermuda Yacht Races). Legal and political career In 1870, Stone resigned from the army and, aided by his extensive self-study, his agile mind, and driving ambition, was certified to practice law in South Carolina. Following a successful law career in Charleston, he became active in state politics and, in 1876, was appointed by Governor Daniel Henry Chamberlain as Attorney General for South Carolina.Appointment document dated May 4, 1876. Original in Stone Family Archives. Final Years When Governor Chamberlain's re-election was overturned by Wade Hampton in 1877, Stone returned with his family to the North, and established a highly successful career as an attorney in New York City.

Originally created as a man's riding boot in the 15th century, in the latter part of the 20th century, the style was redefined as a fashion boot for women. Over-the-knee boots are also used as a work boot in circumstances requiring additional protection for the legs (e.g. fishing waders). As men's footwear Over-the-knee boots first became popular as riding boots for men in the 15th century, when the growing popularity of doublet and lightweight hose meant that extra protection was required for the legs when on horseback. This was also linked to the decline in the use of full plate armour as the use of firearms became more widespread in warfare. Heavy cavalry in the 16th and 17th centuries had only limited armour, in the form of a helmet and breastplate, or cuirass. Thigh-length boots in heavy leather provided additional protection for the legs. Today, many cavalry regiments still retain these high boots for ceremonial dress. Riding boots of this style were widespread in the 17th and 18th century, and remained in common use through to the late 19th century. They are the likely source of the term bootlegging, which originally came from the practice of concealing hip flasks of alcohol in the legs of boots. Because of these historical associations, cuissardes came to convey an image of potent masculinity, conjuring up images of cavaliers, pirates, or musketeers. As women's footwear Woman wearing over-the-knee fashion boots, 2011 The earliest examples of women wearing over-the-knee boots come from the traditional principal boy role in pantomime theater, in which the young male protagonist of the play is played by a young actress in boys' clothes. These breeches roles were also a rare opportunity for an early 20th century actress to wear a revealing costume, potentially increasing the size of the audience. When playing historical characters such as Dick Whittington, the principal boy would often wear over-the-knee boots as part of her costume, emphasizing her swashbuckling, heroic character. The adoption of over-the-knee boots as a fashion item for women began in the early 1960s. In 1962, Balenciaga's fall collection featured a tall boot by Mancini that just covered the knee and the following year, Yves Saint Laurent's couture collection included thigh-length alligator skin boots by designer Roger Vivier. These were based on a design originally produced by Vivier for the dancer Rudolf Nureyev in the ballet Swan Lake. The adaptation of hyper-masculine boots as fashion footwear for women has been interpreted as part of a broader 1960s trend against the femininity of Dior's post-war \\"New Look\\". Rising hemlines and the availability of new, brightly colored artificial materials such as PVC, combined to make boots an attractive fashion option for younger women. As skirts became even shorter in the late 1960s, there was a resurgence of interest in thigh-length boots or cuissardes. Pierre Cardin featured shiny black PVC thighboots as part of his futuristic 1968 couture collection and Beth Levine designed seamless, stretch vinyl and nylon stocking boots tall enough to do double duty as hosiery. The tallest boots from this period were so high that they were equipped with suspenders to hold them up. Over the next three decades, the popularity of over-the-knee boots as a fashion item for women waxed and waned. In the early 1970s, the multi-colored suede and canvas over-the-knee boots produced by the London store Biba were so sought-after that queues would form outside the store when a delivery was due. The end of the decade saw a second-wave of over-the-knee and thigh-length boots; these were a longer version of the stack-heeled knee-length boots popular in the late 1970s and were usually worn over jeans. In the late 1980s, over-the-knee boots made a reappearance; these were loose-fitting, low-heeled styles in suede, often brightly colored or decorated with brocade. By 1990, Karl Lagerfeld had included thigh-length satin boots in his Fall/Winter Couture collection for Chanel, using the boots as an alternative to leggings; there was a brief vogue for thigh-length \\"riding boots‚Äù in the early 1990s and over-the-knee styles were intermittently popular throughout the first decade of the 21st century. In 2009, thigh-length boots were a subject of major attention by the fashion press,Reach for the Thighs. Marie Claire, October 2009, p. 26 receiving guarded approval and a level of mainstream acceptance that they had never previously achieved; this trend continued in 2010 and by the following year, over-the-knee styles had become commonplace. Thigh-high boots are more flattering on women with longer legs: \\"The shorter you are, the less leg there is above the top of the boot, when wearing footwear that ends above the knee. A very high heel helps to give the illusion of height, but when there is much more boot visible than leg; the effect is to optically foreshorten you.\\" As work boots Hip boots in mud Hip boots (sometimes colloquially called \\"waders\\"), are a type of boot worn by river fishermen. Hip boots are typically made out of rubber, and cover the legs to the tops of the thighs or to the waist. They are designed to protect the fisherman when wading into deeper waters and keep the feet and legs warm in autumn and winter. Hip boots are also worn by ecologists and environmental scientists who do tests in swamps or lakes to determine the quality of water. In contrast to hip boots, waders are waterproof boots that extend from the foot to the chest. Waders are available with boots attached or can have attached stocking feet (usually made of the wader material), to wear inside shorter boots. In addition to being used for leisure purposes, such as angling or waterfowl hunting, industrial, heavy-duty waders are used as protective clothing in the chemical industry, agriculture and in the maintenance of water supply, sewerage and other utilities.

After two months of constant assaults, the relief army forced the Persians to retreat. Thus, resulted in a decisive victory for the Mughal Empire.  Background  The Mughals had obtained the city of Kandahar in 1595, after the Mughal army advanced to the city's governor, Mo·∫ìaffar-·∏§osayn MirzƒÅ, and negotiated with him a surrender.Iranica 2011 The Safavid ruler, Shah Abbas, was shocked by the loss of the important fortress but as main Iranian concerns lay with the equally powerful Ottomans at their westernmost territories, he abstained from military action, preferring to negotiate a settlement.  Battle  When Emperor Akbar died on October 27, 1605, the Safavid governor of Herat, Hosayn Khan, moved to recapture the city on behalf of the Safavids while the Mughals were distracted from other matters. The city, defended by governor ≈†ƒÅh Beg Khan, held out the Safavid siege until the next year when the new Emperor, Jahangir, sent an army that lifted the siege.  Aftermath  Abbas repudiated Hosayn's actions in a letter to Jahangir, and both sides reestablished normal relations, though Kandahar would remain a controversial affair between both parties.

The character made his debut during the episode broadcast on 22 November 2011, portrayed by Andrew Still. Still was attending the Scottish Youth Theatre when Lime Pictures presented the establishment with a casting opportunity for Hollyoaks. The actor secured two auditions for the role and after the second audition he was offered the part. Joel has been characterised through themes of violence. He is on probation for assault, and he loses his temper with various characters. Despite this, Joel does not like domestic violence because his stepfather hit his mother. His dislike of such violence played a role in his early storylines. He was written out of the series in 2012 and departed on 9 January 2013. On 18 August 2016, it was confirmed that Joel would be returning to Hollyoaks with the role recast to Rory Douglas-Speed; he returned on 8 September 2016. Joel was originally introduced as a \\"mysterious newcomer\\" who is hiding a secret. It was then revealed that he is the long-lost son of established character Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas). Lomas had already announced his intention to leave the series and Joel played a role in Warren's departure storyline. Still has stated that when his character first arrived on-screen, he was \\"quite floaty\\" with nowhere to live. Joel was later given further connections to characters within the show, such as Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan) who gives him a \\"criminal education\\" and Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter) as they begin a relationship. In May 2012, Joel was involved in a stabbing storyline. Still has spoken of his efforts to make the scenes in which Joel is stabbed as realistic as possible. This was because he felt that many people were victims of stabbing at the time. Upon the character returning to the show, his storylines were reunited with his father, trainee to become a priest, being targeted by Sienna Blake (Anna Passey) as part of her revenge for her daughter's death, being responsible for his aunt Katy Fox's (Hannah Tointon) death from a drug overdose and his relationship and later engagement to Cleo McQueen (Nadine Rose Mulkerrin). Still's portrayal of Joel has earned him a \\"Best Newcomer\\" award. Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton opined that Joel was a \\"scrawny teenage boy\\" and that his storyline with Brendan was \\"quite laughable\\". While a Heat reporter said that Joel is a \\"smug\\" character. But a columnist from TV Choice said that Joel's stabbing was a \\"shockingly violent turn\\", and Laura Morgan from All About Soap branded the scenes \\"gruesome and dramatic\\". Casting Still was cast into the programme after Lime Pictures, who produce the serial, presented the Scottish Youth Theatre with a casting opportunity. Although Still did not have any previous television acting experience, he impressed the casting department. Still had two auditions for the role and was offered the role on his way home from his second audition. Still revealed that when he was cast, he had to remain secretive for a period of two months. Still also said that the cast were \\"fantastic\\". Before his character debuted on-screen, Still revealed that he hoped to his character would remain in the series and become one of Hollyoaks \\"staple characters\\". Character development Characterisation A writer from the official Hollyoaks website described Joel as a \\"whole lot of exciting things rolled into one\\". They said that he \\"immediately caused a stir\\" upon his arrival and that when he is not trying to outsmart Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan) he is \\"happy to cause trouble elsewhere\\". Joel is nicknamed \\"Scottish Foxy\\" which was coined by Brendan and Still himself loved the name. Joel is often seen sporting a leather jacket. Still told a reporter from the serial's official website that \\"I hate that leather jacket, I wear it every day, I hate it and it squeaks so much\\". He explained that it was a vintage item but since it had since been \\"beaten up\\" from various characters always pushing Joel \\"up against walls\\". He said that his ideal scene to represent Joel in the opening titles would be him \\"ironing his leather jacket, the inside of it, making it all nice for his day\\". Still has said that Joel began \\"quite floaty as a character\\" because he had no fixed home. He is searching for a missing connection and he \\"doesn't really have a focus in his life\\". The actor concluded that \\"he's got a tough outer shell, but inside he's quite vulnerable.\\" Introduction He was initially described as a \\"mysterious newcomer\\" who would change the life of an established character \\"forever\\". Joel arrives to work as a dubstep DJ at Chez Chez at the same time Brendan disappears from the village. He is also planned to become part of a storyline in which fellow character Maddie Morrison (Scarlett Bowman) becomes attracted to him. However, Joel is uninterested as there is \\"only one person on his mind\\". On 15 November 2011, Digital Spy's Kilkelly reported that Maddie would attempt to use Joel by flirting to make Callum Kane (Laurie Duncan) jealous. Joel is not impressed and is \\"quite mean\\" to Maddie, Still told Kilkelly that Joel's outburst of anger was not a \\"one-off\\" because he does have a \\"quick temper\\". But Joel does have \\"conscience\\" and in one episode he was \\"ranting and raving\\" and the next he was \\"apologising straight away\\". It was later announced that Joel's reason for coming to the village is Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas), who he believes to be his father. Sill stated that Joel is a great character because he is characterised as a \\"mysterious bad boy\\" who arrives \\"not really having any direction and is looking for his father\\". Joel doesn't have much in his life and he is searching for something that is missing. Warren is not impressed by Joel's arrival because he is \\"paranoid that Brendan sent Joel in to play with his mind\\". While Joel is essentially a \\"troublemaker\\" he has a \\"vulnerability because of what has happened in the past\\". Joel leaves for a while, but his return causes trouble and drama with \\"certain characters in around Chez Chez, perhaps with one Brendan Brady, they'll be clashing\\". Lomas told a writer from TVTimes that his character thinks that \\"this kid could be anybody's - he could be making it up or he could be after money\\". Joel shows Warren a picture of him and his mother, but feels that the evidence is not sufficient enough. In December 2011, series producer Emma Smithwick said that she thought Joel was \\"great and so dynamic\\" and that she was enjoying his on-screen presence. She added that he would \\"be involved heavily\\" in Warren's exit storyline. Warren and Brendan's feud culminates in Brendan and Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton) plotting to rid of Warren. Scanlan told a reporter from What's on TV that his character uses Joel \\"as a pawn\\" by \\"befriending the kid and winning his trust\\". He added that there is no proof that Joel is Warren's son, but that did not matter because he is \\"as he's still a way for Brendan to get to Warren\\". Still thought it was \\"fantastic\\" to be given the opportunity to be involved with Warren's departure storyline. In the lead up to his on-screen father's exit, Joel accompanies him on a holiday in Paris. Still explained that upon their return, it is evident that they have are closer. He thought it was \\"interesting\\" because Warren did not want Joel to go with him, but it conjured up a \\"connection\\" between the father and son. But Brendan's scheming soon takes hold. Still told Kilkelly that when Joel first arrived \\"he wasn't getting any answers at all\\", so he chose to befriend Brendan in attempt to discover more about Warren. As he Joel and Warren have made a \\"connection\\", Still stated that \\"Brendan has kind of fallen by the wayside. Joel's very wary of Brendan now - especially after what his dad's told him, and what he's seen for himself.\\" In the same episodes, Warren's relationship with Mitzeee is failing and he becomes violent towards her. The actor said that because Joel hates violence towards women after his experiences with his stepdad, Joel feels responsible to take the role of protecting Mitzeee from the violence. Warren's violence does not \\"sit well\\" with Joel and he faces a dilemma. He is brought to the realisation that Warren and Mitzeee's situation \\"mirrors his family life back home\\" and Joel finds it \\"hard\\" to deal with. Still added that \\"there'll be a big conflict for Joel as to whether he stands by his dad or stands by his principles\\". Feuds and relationships Producers gave Joel romantic links, mainly in the form of Joel's Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter). He also has a fling with Annalise Appleton (Tamaryn Payne) and \\"made eyes at\\" Ash Kane (Holly Weston). Joel and Theresa's relationship began with a flirtation. Still told Hendry from the Daily Record that it occurs \\"by nature\\" because she has a history with Warren, which is \\"mirrored\\" between them. Theresa is the \\"kind of girl\\" that gains Joel's attention. Porter explained that the two character get together as \\"clearly there's something between\\" them. But Joel has a fight with Theresa's ex-boyfriend Will Savage (James Atherton) and it \\"all goes wrong\\". She added that \\"Theresa's not impressed by Joel's jealous streak - but she's still got the hots for him\\". In March 2012, Laura Morgan of All About Soap said that Joel would get a \\"criminal education\\" from Brendan. Joel later begins feuding with Callum and in one scene they have a fight. Joel's violent trait is played out once again when he attacks Doug Carter (PJ Brennan) to retrieve a package that Brendan has trusted Doug with. Brenndan told Digital Spy's Kilkelly that it was part of a \\"side-plot\\" between Joel and Brendan. Even though Joel cannot figure out what the deal is between Brendan and Doug - \\"he wants to be involved\\". He added that Joel is so \\"resentful over being left out of the loop\\" that he puts on a mask and attacks Doug and steals the package. In April 2012, a writer from Inside Soap reported that \\"bad boy\\" Joel would force Bart McQueen (Jonny Clarke) to grow cannabis plants. Clarke told the writer that his character does not know what he has agreed to do for Joel and is left feeling \\"unnerved\\". Stabbing In March 2012, Kilkelly reported that Joel would be injured in a new storyline. He noted that while it was unconfirmed, Still had been seen filming on location alongside Scanlan, covered in blood. Joel later tries to earn Brendan's respect. Still told a writer from What's on TV that Joel is desperate to impress Brendan because he is \\"young and naive and he's grown up without a male role model\\". As Warren is not around, Brendan is \\"fulfilling that role\\", but \\"basically Joel's a stupid little boy\\". Walker's (Neil Newbon) \\"shadowy and intellectual\\" persona intimidates Joel, he dislikes him because he becomes close to Brendan and that is something Joel is not a part of. Joel ultimately grows jealous. When they discover that Walker has been lying about his financial situation, Brendan recruits Joel to teach him a lesson. Still told Allison Slade from TVTimes that \\"it's really not a case of Brendan asking Joel to come on board; more that Joel nags his way into it. But he bites of more than he can chew.\\" He sends Joel to pick up a package in return for money in \\"certainly not an above-board deal\\". Brendan knows that the men were \\"crazy\\" and Joel also realises that \\"all is not what it seems\\". Still stated that they treat him like a \\"piggy in the middle\\" and Joel grasps that they're nutters\\". He attempts to retrieve the money from them but Sampson (Sean Cernow) stabs him. Joel is \\"left in a bad way and his life is hanging in the balance\\". Joel's stabbing boosted ratings for the serial's \\"first look\\" edition airing on E4. Still told Sally Brockway from Soaplife that filming the stabbing scenes was \\"intense\\". He was \\"determined\\" to make it look \\"real\\" because stabbings occurred often in his home town of Glasgow. Still said that he \\"wanted to get the severity of it across and prevent it from looking fake\\". He concluded that the storyline should have made Joel \\"see sense\\" and not be \\"in thrall\\" to Brendan. But noted that \\"you have to remember that Joel's a bit of an idiot\\". In June 2012, Scanlan announced that Joel would feature in the fifth series of Hollyoaks Later alongside the characters of Brendan, Walker and Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh). He added that their storyline would be \\"massive\\" and \\"hard-hitting\\". Reintroduction and recast In August 2016, Kilkelly reported that Joel would be returning to Hollyoaks with the role recast to Rory Douglas-Speed and that Joel has found God during his time away from the village and is now a trainee priest. Producers billed Joel as a man who's walking the road to redemption after his previous mistakes. Douglas- Speed commented: \\"I'm super chuffed to be a part of such a well-known and well received show. Everybody involved is amazing. I'm really excited to see how the character develops. Looking forward to the next chapter of my career. Storylines 2011‚Äì2013 Joel arrives to work as a new DJ at Chez Chez and on his first night at work he spends time with Maddie who comes on to him. He takes Maddie outside thinking she is going to sleep with him. As he tries to kiss her she pushes him off and he accuses her of playing games and shouts at her for teasing. He later threatens Callum Kane (Laurie Duncan) for criticising his treatment of Maddie. He argues with Warren who suspects that Brendan has sent him to the village, where he reveals that Warren is his father. Theresa convinces Joel to give Warren some time to come to terms with the situation. She also gets Warren to take a paternity test which reveals that he is Joel's biological father. Joel and Warren decide to give each other a chance and get to know each other. Joel reveals that he spent time in a young offender's prison after he assaulted his violent stepfather who would abuse his mother. Joel agrees to go on holiday with Warren and his girlfriend Mitzeee where he bonds with Warren. Joel is shocked when Warren becomes forceful during an argument with Mitzeee. Joel tells Warren that he will not stand for violence against women because of his experiences with his stepfather. Joel pulls a gun on Brendan, who is trying to prevent Warren from killing Mitzeee. Brendan manages to talk Joel over and they stop Warren and get him arrested for murdering his ex. Joel attempts to comfort Mitzeee and when Brendan show no gratitude for Joel's help, he decides that he should leave. Joel goes to see Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter) before he leaves, who tells him that he should stay. Joel returns and reveals that Warren has signed his share in the club to him. Brendan attempts to buy him out, but Joel tells him that the offer is too little. Mitzeee tries to help Brendan to get rid of Joel. Theresa goes on a date with Joel, which makes Will jealous. When Joel punches Will, Theresa tells him that she does not want to see him again. Brendan invites Joel to move in with him and makes an effort to befriend him. When Joel rebuffs Lacey Kane's (Georgia Bourke) advances because she is to young, and her brother Callum attacks Joel after Lacey pretends that he tried to kiss her. Joel tries to impress Brendan by running illegal errands for him. Brendan enlists Dave (Michael Camp) to beat Joel up during an errand, which Brendan does to test Joel. He later tries to become more involved with the business and sets up club night. Bart helps Joel set up for the night, but Bart invites many of his underage friends. When Joel learns that Callum has kissed Theresa, Joel attacks him and subsequently ruins his club night. Joel blames Bart and forces him to grow cannabis; while Brendan tells Joel he can no longer trust him. However, when Brendan's friend Walker (Neil Newbon) backs out of a dodgy deal - Joel goes along instead. Joel realises that he has walked into a trap and when he tries to escape he is stabbed. Joel is taken into hospital where Brendan apologises for putting him in danger. Joel is later kidnapped by Sampson (Sean Cernow) who ties his hands and puts a grenade in his hands. Brendan and Walker save him, but realise that Sampson used Joel as a distraction so they could vandalise Chez Chez. 2016‚Äìpresent Police officer Ryan Knight (Duncan James) questions Joel (now played by Rory Douglas Speed) about Warren's role in the murder investigation of Patrick Blake (Jeremy Sheffield). Ryan knows Joel because he had previously spared Joel from drug charges. Joel reconnects with Warren before revealing himself as a practicing vicar. Joel later becomes a target of Warren's girlfriend Sienna Blake (Anna Passey), who blames Warren for the death of her daughter Nico Blake (Persephone Swales-Dawson). Using a false name, Sienna tells him that she wants revenge on an abusive boyfriend who was responsible for her daughter's death, visiting the church regularly and growing closer to Joel. She invites him to a bar and tries to kiss him, but he rejects her. Subsequently, Sienna tricks Warren into thinking that she is being stalked by a man from the church. Whilst looking for the \\"stalker\\", Warren meets Joel again and they begin to revive their relationship. After Joel discovers Sienna's true identity, she knocks him unconscious with his motorbike helmet and drags him into the garage, and accidentally sets the garage on fire. Warren soon discovers Sienna has trapped Joel in the flames. When Warren attempts to save Joel, the garage explodes and injures Sienna and Warren. The latter races back into the flames to save Joel from death. Sienna apologizes and tries to help Joel when his former friend from prison, Shane Sweeney (Lanre Malaolu) starts blackmailing him. It is revealed that Shane has a video of Joel, alongside Bart, giving his aunt Katy Fox (Hannah Tointon) drugs which resulted in an overdose that killed her. Shane threatens to show Warren the video if Joel doesn't give him money. Sienna later discovers that Shane is blackmailing him and frames Shane for kidnapping her, causing him to flee Hollyoaks but he sends Warren the video. Joel manages to delete it on time. Joel lies that Bart gave Katy the drug that killed her and Warren plans to kill Bart. Joel gives Bart money to flee Hollyoaks for good. Joel panics when he finds out that Warren murdered Bart and decides to tell the police. However, Sienna convinces him not too because she is pregnant with his twins. Joel becomes closer to Bart's cousin Cleo McQueen (Nadine Mulkerrin) who has feelings for him. Joel freaks out when he thinks that he saw Bart. A concerned Cleo tracks him down at the church and they kiss. Joel decides to leave the church to be with Cleo. They decide to live a new life together and they head of on his motorbike. They almost collide with a car of teenagers driven by Cleo's cousin Prince McQueen (Malique Thompson-Dwyer) but Joel swerves to avoid them and Cleo is thrown down a grass verge while Joel falls of his motorbike. Emergency services fail to spot Cleo as she is hidden and Joel is unconscious so no one knows she is there. At the hospital, Joel asks Warren how Cleo is but Warren tells him Cleo wasn't with him.

Joel becomes concerned when Sienna tries to set him up with Maxine Minniver (Nikki Sanderson) and she tells them that she wants them to be parents to Sebastian when she is gone. However, they are delighted when doctors tell her that she is in remission. Reception For his portrayal of Joel, Still was nominated for \\"Best Newcomer\\" at the 2012 TV Choice Awards. A writer from TV Choice said that Joel was \\"well out of his depth trying to run Warren's half of Chez Chez\\"; they added that his dealings with Bart formed an \\"unholy alliance\\". A writer from Heat said that Joel is a \\"smug\\" character and his flirting with Theresa was an \\"ultimate cringe moment\\". Inside Soap's Laura-Jayne Tyler branded Joel an \\"impressionable\\" character. On Joel's stabbing storyline, a writer from Reveal said that \\"this is an exciting and dangerous week for Joel, his eagerness to fit in with Brendan and show him he's capable of being the gangster he aspires to be lands him in grave danger.\\" While a columnist from TV Choice revisited their sentiments that Joel was \\"out of his depth\\" - but this time with Walker and added that his stabbing was a \\"shockingly violent turn\\". All About Soap's Morgan said that Still was \\"incredible\\" throughout Joel's stabbing storyline and a \\"shocking climax\\" to the episode. The writer gave praise to Hollyoaks for making the \\"gruesome scenes so dramatic\\" because it left her feeling as though she was viewing \\"a proper gangster movie\\". She said that the \\"cocky, impressionable teen\\" Joel just wanted to be Brendan's \\"right-hand man\\", but \\"while we love his swagger and steely determination, we‚Äôre not convinced Joel‚Äôs ready for a life of hardened criminal activity just yet.\\" Morgan added that Still \\"hit the nail on the head\\" when he said that Joel cannot \\"stand up against the big dogs\\". Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton said that the show was not being credible expecting viewers to believe that \\"this scrawny teenage boy\\" is a \\"worthy opponent for Brendan\\". He added Joel should have been treated as \\"just a minor nuisance\\" and he hoped that Hollyoaks would end the storyline because it was \\"really quite laughable\\". Langford later expressed his delight at Joel's exit from the show, saying \\"I have never liked Joel. He was an ill-conceived, pointless character from the start. The show should have never brought him on as Warren's son, especially with Warren leaving the show. I guess they had planned to make him a nemesis for Brendan, but the actor simply didn't have what it took to go up against someone with the caliber of Emmett Scanlan. Moreover, Joel was always kind of wimpy and failed at every attempt to be a bad ass.\\" Langford added that he did not like the way the writers tried to turn Brendan into a surrogate father for Joel, noting that Brendan would have squashed him like a gnat months ago.

Built between 1902 and 1908 as MOZD (Moscow Encircle Railway, , or just Encircle Line, ) for mixed use railway traffic, after 1934 the railway was only used for cargo traffic. During the 2010s, the railway was converted to be used for commuter rail service and allows free transfers with the Moscow Metro; the passenger service on Moscow Ring Railway started on September 10, 2016, as the Moscow Central Circle. The line is operated by Russian Railways' Moscow subsidiary. History Map of MOZD (Moscow Encircle Railway) in 1908 class –õ hauling a passenger coach during a retro-tour on Moscow Little Ring Railway, November 2013, before the line's electrification. In 1800, the Kamer-Kollezhsky Val became the legal outer border of Moscow. In 1879, some additional areas, including Sokolniki, were annexed to the city; however, at the time Moscow was encircled by a number of further settlements forming an urban agglomeration. Transport connections between these suburbs were poor. A number of proposals to build a ring railroad around the center to solve this were made in the 1860s and the 1870s. One such project was rejected in 1877 by the Moscow City Duma which cited inefficiency. However, the transportation problems became increasingly obvious, and in 1898 after Tsar Nicholas II sent a message to the City Duma declaring that it was desirable to build a railroad, a project competition was opened. The project by Pyotr Rashevsky, who proposed to build a ring of the total length of , won the competition. Construction started in 1902, and the railway was completed with the first train running in July 1907. In 1908, the railroad was declared to be completed, and it became part of the Nikolayevskaya Railway, the main line of which ran between Moscow and Saint Petersburg. A Passenger service was organized of four trains per day. The trains first stopped in Nikolayevsky Railway Station before joining the ring at the Presnya Station. Here trains were divided into two, with one train running clockwise, and the other one running counterclockwise. The Directorate of the Nikolayevskaya Railway was located in Saint Petersburg, and thus it was inconvenient for Moscow decision making. In 1916 control of the ring railway was transferred to the Moscow- Kursk Railway. In 1934 it became a separate railway before in 1956 being included in the Moscow Railway. The Circle Railway became known as Little Ring of the Moscow Railway after the 584 km Greater Ring of the Moscow Railway, 40‚Äì100 km (25-60m) from the city centre, was completed during the Second World War. SZD TE3 with freight train at Gagarina Square (1982). In the 2000s this section was covered. Between 1917 and 1960, the Moscow Little Ring Railway served as the border of the city of Moscow. In 1960, the Moscow Ring Road, a new beltway far outside of the Moscow Little Ring Railway, then just about to be completed, became the new official boundary of the city. On November 18, 1994, Andrey Shchelenkov died from the explosion of his own bomb targeting the river bridge between Vladykino and Rostokino stations. The explosion was not strong, and the bridge survived. Shchelenkov had ties to organized criminal Maxim Lazovsky but the motive remains unknown. By 2012 there were twelve freight stations operating on the railway. The line was reconstructed during the period of 2013‚Äì2016 for joint passenger and freight use. The reconstruction process included: * Electrification of the whole line with 3 kV DC overhead wires and the construction of substations * Construction of new passenger stations and rehabilitation of old stations * Construction of an additional third track on the northern half of the circle for freight trains * Construction of depot for EMU trains at Podmoskovnaya stations * Construction of interchanges with existing Moscow Metro stations.  Moscow Central Circle Line  The Moscow Central Circle is a passenger metropolitan line that runs along the Little Ring of the Moscow Railway, operated by Russian Railways as subcontractor for Moscow Metro. It was opened for passengers on September 10, 2016, after a four-year construction period. The passenger service is operated by 33 Siemens ES2G Lastochka trains.

Origins While the City of Montreal's official website states that the facility was built in 1930, the Verdun Guardian newspaper reported on the official opening on July 12, 1940 and inaugurated by Johnny Weissmuller, with the pool hosting the 1940 Dominion Swimming and Diving Championships, shortly afterward. Finances The city of Verdun took out a $200,000 loan to fund construction. Once open, the pool's admission revenue covered operating costs and allowed Verdun to pay back its loan. The city paid back $9,500 each year from 1941 to 1945, and approximately $11,000 each year from 1946 to 1951. By 1951, the Natatorium had never lost money and was projected to fully pay off its loan in ten more years. Many of the workers were men that were receiving \\"workfare\\" a benefit for people out of work due to the great depression. Skilled workers such as steamfitters were paid to build the Natatorium for the city. Facility The city of Montreal states that the main pool can accommodate 1,150 bathers while in 1951 the Montreal Gazette, reported that the pool could handle up to 6,000 swimmers on a daily basis. This difference may be due to changes to the facility and/or safety regulations over time. In the summer 2005, a heated wading pool was added, with a capacity of up to 250 children.

It was written by the British religious studies scholar Michael York of Bath Spa University and first published by New York University Press in 2003. In Pagan Theology, York presents his controversial theory that the term \\"paganism\\", originally a pejorative term to refer to non-Christian religions, should instead be used by scholars to refer specifically to those religious movements who share the common characteristics of polytheism, animism and life-affirming beliefs. Under this category of \\"paganism\\", York therefore includes the extinct historical faiths of pre-Christian Europe, living indigenous religions, several modern religions like Shinto and Hinduism, and the new religious movements of contemporary Paganism. Furthermore, York argues that this \\"paganism\\" was the \\"root religion\\" of humanity, from which later monotheistic religions like Judaism, Christianity and Islam developed. Academic reviews of York's book were mixed, with reviewers making note of the ambitious nature of Pagan Theology, but some believing that it failed to present an entirely convincing argument. As a result of this, not all of them agreed with York's proposed categories, citing various reasons why they believed that it should not be employed. In the wider field of Pagan studies it has been criticised, most notably by Michael F. Strmiska, who argued that it contributed to the cultural oppression of indigenous peoples. Background At the time of writing, York was a self-proclaimed \\"pagan practitioner\\" as well as a religious studies academic.York 2003. p. 4. Commenting on his own personal religious and spiritual beliefs, York related that: :If I had to name my own denominational predilection, I would say that I am a \\"religionist.\\" I believe in religion itself and its central role in expanding human consciousness above and beyond immediate daily concerns. I see religion as an ongoing dialogue that questions the purpose of life and our terrestrial incarnations. In my own pursuit and love of religion as religion, I have been particularly attracted to paganism not only as the source and origin of all religion but also as an organic alternative to the institutionalized and parochial insularity that much religious expression has become.York 2003. p. ix. Synopsis In his introduction, York explains his approach to religion, which he chooses to define as \\"a shared apprehension of the world, humanity, and the supernatural and their interrelation.\\" He proceeds to use a map as a metaphor for religion, noting that both help the individual to navigate their own way through the world. Exclaiming that paganism should be seen as a religion in itself, he criticises earlier religious studies scholars for failing to devote time to a discussion of this term, whose etymology he then explains.York 2003. pp. 1-7. In the next chapter, entitled \\"Paganism as Religion\\", York argues that religious studies scholars should not use \\"paganism\\" in reference purely to pre-Christian religions in Europe or Neopaganism, but expand it to refer to a far wider group of animistic, polytheistic beliefs across the world. Putting together a list of five criteria that believes can be used to define \\"paganism\\", he then explores a series of seven different religious groups or beliefs and explains how they fit into this category of his: Chinese Folk Religion, Shinto, Primal Tribal Religions, shamanism, American Indian Spirituality, Afro-American Spiritism, and Contemporary Western Paganism.York 2003. pp. 8-65. Arguments Redefining \\"paganism\\" In Pagan Theology, York exclaims that his purpose is to \\"expand the concept of paganism.\\"York 2003. p. 8. Noting that the term had been originally employed by the early Christians of the Roman Empire to describe adherents of non-Jewish religions, he notes that the pre-Christian and pre-Islamic beliefs of Europe that this initial description covered are similar to other Indigenous religions across the world, and so should also be considered to be \\"pagan\\".York 2003. pp. 5-6. As such, York argues that religious studies scholars should define \\"paganism\\" as a religion utilising five specific criteria, all of which were exhibited in the pre-Christian religions of Europe: :\\"[P]aganism includes (1) a number of both male and female gods, (2) magical practice, (3) emphasis on ritual efficacy, (4) corpospirituality, and (5) an understanding of gods and humans as codependent and related.\\"York 2003. p. 14. York argues that many of the world's religious movements fit these criteria and should therefore be labelled \\"pagan\\". This includes the original pre-Christian religions of Europe, and the Contemporary Pagan, or Neopagan religions inspired by them. To this he adds indigenous religions from North America, Australia and Africa, as well as the religions of the African diaspora such as Vodou and Santeria. He furthermore includes two east Asian faiths, Chinese traditional religion and Japanese Shinto, as well as any practices involving shamanism. Utilising the figures for global religious adherence that were published by David Barrett in his World Christian Encyclopedia (1982), York argues that by the year 2000, 6% of the world's population would be \\"pagan\\" under his definition of the term. According to his reckoning, this makes paganism one of the world's major religious blocs, alongside the \\"Christian-Islamic\\" bloc, the \\"nonreligious/atheist\\" bloc, the \\"Hindu-Buddhist\\" bloc, the \\"new religious\\" block and the \\"other\\" bloc, and that as such it should be defined as a world religion with global coverage.York 2003. p. 10. Paganism as \\"root religion\\" Reception and recognition Academic reviews In her review for the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Melissa Raphael of the University of Gloucestershire argued that York's work \\"does well to remind us that the religious academy has for too long patronized, ignored or (inaccurately) consigned pagan religion and spirituality to the \\"odds and ends\\" bin of the New Age movement.\\" Considering Pagan Theology to be a \\"dense and serious study\\", that was based upon York's \\"exceptionally well traveled\\" experiences, Raphael noted however that it was \\"not quite what I was expecting. The main title would have led me to believe that I had found a book on the divine in Western, earth-based neo-pagan religions. Pagan Theology is a good deal more ambitious than that\\". Raphael proceeded to argue that she was \\"disappointed\\" that the work \\"paid little attention to the inflections of gender\\", in particular considering the prominent role held by female deities in most of the pagan religions described in the book. She also felt some \\"disquiet\\" that the word \\"theology\\" was being used by York in reference to certain religious groups for whom \\"the philosophical and cultural freighting of both logos and theos are categorically and conceptually alien\\". Furthermore, she expressed concern over the fact that \\"many of the religions to which York ascribes paganism would disown it\\" whilst others would \\"deny that they share any common essence with other religions.\\" In her review for the Sociology of Religion journal, Mary Jo Neitz of the University of Missouri noted that she agreed with York that \\"paganism is a legitimate category of religion for both practitioners and for those of us who study religion.\\" Nonetheless, she disagreed with his position of \\"establishing universal definitions of paganism as a world religion or an essential practice\\", arguing that in doing so he was \\"gloss[ing] over significant differences\\" between different religious groups by \\"universalizing\\" them under cover-all categories. On a more positive note, she felt that the book would be a useful text for those studying courses on world religions, aiding students in asking the question as to \\"what scholars mean by the category of world religion itself, and who is served by maintaining the traditional boundaries which establish those belief systems and practices that count as insider and those which must be cast outside.\\"Neitz 2004. Writing in The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies, Barbara Jane Davy of Concordia University described Pagan Theology as being \\"Part travelogue, part theological argument, [and] part sociological study\\", providing a \\"tour through paganism's multiple forms in space and time.\\" Believing that York had presented \\"a good argument\\" for using the term \\"paganism\\" to refer to a global \\"root religion\\", she noted however that \\"Some readers will sense a conflict between York's presentation of paganism as a world religion and as root religion. This perhaps derives from an ambiguity in his desires about paganism: for it to be a 'proper' religion, worthy of study, and a legitimate form of religious practice, but also to present it as distinctive, unlike all other religion, and as foundational to all religion.\\" She also praised his use of the lower case \\"paganism\\" to refer to the global phenomenon, arguing that it \\"differentiates his subject matter from what is usually understood in Pagan studies as contemporary Paganism, Neopaganism, or sometimes modern or Western Paganism.\\" Ultimately, she remarked that her \\"only complaint\\" was that she would have liked to have seen York \\"relate his understanding of paganism to Robert Redfield's understanding of folk practices in terms of \\"little traditions\\" as opposed to the institutionalized \\"great traditions\\" usually identified as \\"world religions,\\" discussed in The Little Community and Peasant Society and Culture (1969).\\" Reception in Pagan studies scholarship =Chas S. Clifton and The Pomegranate= Writing in volume 6.1 of The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies (2004), the journal's editor, Chas S. Clifton of Colorado State University‚ÄìPueblo, made reference to York's work in his discussion of the definition of Pagan studies.Clifton 2004. p. 6. Clifton proceeded to argue that the development of Pagan studies was necessary to \\"set forth an audacious redefinition of the term \\"pagan\\" as Michael York has done\\", something which Clifton felt \\"gives us room to reexamine from fresh perspectives all manifestation of ancient Pagan religions\\".Clifton 2004. pp. 7-8. =Michael F. Strmiska= Writing in the opening paper of his edited academic anthology Modern Paganism in World Cultures: Comparative Perspectives (2005), the American religious studies scholar Michael F. Strmiska, then working at Central Connecticut State University, commented on York's argument in Pagan Theology, noting that it was the same as that made by the political scientist and practicing Wiccan Gus DiZerega in his book Pagans and Christians: The Personal Spiritual Experience (2001).Strmiska 2005. p. 11. Although considering such a theory to be \\"thought provoking\\", Strmiska ultimately rejected it because he felt that \\"blurring together the religious identities of these many different peoples, with their vastly different historical and contemporary situations, does a disservice to Indigenous peoples' struggles for postcolonial self-determination by conflating them with the very peoples they see as their oppressors and colonizers.\\" Although accepting that \\"modern Euro-American Pagans\\" were often \\"sympathetic\\" to Indigenous peoples and \\"interested in learning aspects\\" of their \\"cultural and religious traditions\\", Strmiska noted that the \\"contemporary situations\\" between the two ethno-cultural groups was \\"quite different\\" and that this \\"brutal social reality and the immense historical, economic, and political realities that lie behind it cannot be bridged by a simple labelling process or ameliorated by a unilateral proclamation of spiritual unity between modern Pagans and Indigenous peoples.\\" Strmiska also felt that it was \\"worth observing the simple courtesy of calling people by the names they wish to be known by and not calling them by names they reject or are uncomfortable with. The designations Pagan and Paganism, let alone Neopagan or Neopaganism, are not the terms of choice that Native Americans or other Indigenous peoples usually apply to themselves and their religious traditions.\\"Strmiska 2005. p. 13. He proceeded to argue that \\"[d]isagreements over terminology may seem petty or trivial, but they are not if we consider what is at stake for modern Pagans.\\" In particular, he noted both the historical persecution of those labelled pagans and the continued \\"legal and political\\" oppression of modern Pagans.

Early life and Chicago years  Born in 1915, Margaret Esse Danner came of age in Chicago during the Great Migration. Sources place her birth in Pryorsburg, Kentucky, in 1915, although she adamantly claimed Chicago as her birthplace.Margaret Danner, letter to Langston Hughes, October 19, 1966, Langston Hughes Papers, Box 51, Beinecke Library, Yale University, New Haven, CT. In eighth grade, she won first prize in a school contest for \\"The Violin\\", a poem describing Stradivarius and Guarnerius violins. Danner's college education included courses at Loyola University, Northwestern University, YMCA College, and the newly founded Roosevelt College.‚ÄúGuide to the Margaret Danner Papers 1940‚Äì1984‚Äù, University of Chicago Library 2009. Accessed 11 Dec 2011. Perhaps equally significant was her education in the African-American cultural community of Chicago's South Side, which in the 1930s and 1940s harbored grassroots cultural institutions and informal circles devoted to politics, education, art and literature and often tied to the Communist Popular Front.James Edward Smethurst, The Black Arts Movement: Literary Nationalism in the 1960s and 1970s (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2005), 183. Although Danner stayed detached from Communism and would eventually oppose all radical politics, she participated in various South Side groups, including Inez Cunningham Stark's poetry workshop at the South Side Community Art Center, along with Gwendolyn Brooks and Margaret Goss Burroughs, her \\"sometime friends (and rivals).\\"Smethurst, Black Arts Movement, 205. In 1946, Danner founded Art Associates to gather and promote Chicago's black writers and poets. She counted as friends the poet and critic Edward Bland, as well as Hoyt Fuller, who would head the revived Negro Digest (later Black World) beginning in 1951. Danner attracted mentors outside the South Side, including the poets Paul Eagle and Karl Shapiro. She also struck up a correspondence with Langston Hughes that would continue until his death.Margaret Danner, letters to Langston Hughes, Langston Hughes Papers, Box 51, Beinecke Library, Yale University, New Haven, CT. In 1945, she wrote to Hughes: \\"My life as a poet looks very bleak to me now.... Only last night I read one of mine and was told it was elusive, ethereal etc. Not much help for my people in that sort of verse.\\"Letter to Hughes, June 20, 1945. She aimed \\"to inject some strength\\" into her work and to train her naturally delicate style to carry forceful messages of African-American pride and racial equality, what she called \\"the social conscious\\"Letter to Hughes, June 1, 1949; Langston Hughes and Margaret Danner, Writers of the Revolution, sound recording on LP, Black Forum, 1970. Poems such as \\"Etta Moten's Attic\\" and \\"Africa, Drifting Through Me Sings\\" demonstrate Danner's growing passion for black African arts, cultures and peoples in the 1940s and 1950s. She looked to National Geographic magazines, anthropology books and American museums for information and images.June Aldridge, \\"Benin to Beale Street: African Art in the Poetry of Margaret Danner\\", CLA Journal 2 (December 31, 1987): 203. Professing \\"the power of the African pull to be stronger than Western Civilization in my psyche,\\" Danner framed many of her poems around encounters with African art objects. She wrote in 1968, \\"I believe (and have tried for many years to do something positive about this conviction) that the Black should be awakened to his vast beauty.\\"Margaret Danner, interview in \\"Writers Symposium\\", Negro Digest 17.3 (January 1968): 19. Danner joined the staff of Poetry: A Magazine of Verse as an editorial assistant in 1951 and in 1956 became the first African American to serve as a Poetry assistant editor. \\"Far From Africa: Four Poems,\\" which would become one of Danner's most anthologized works, appeared in Poetry in 1951 and earned her a John Hay Whitney fellowship for a trip to Africa, which she delayed until 1966. June M. Aldridge notes that Danner \\"recall[ed] the association with Poetry as one of the most rewarding experiences of her life.\\"June M. Aldridge, \\"Margaret Esse Danner\\", Dictionary of Literary Biography v. 41: Afro-American poets since 1955, eds. Trudier Harris and Thadious M. Davis (Detroit: Gale Research Co., 1985), 85. However, by the late 1950s, according to James Edward Smethurst, \\"Danner's career as a poet seemed to her stalled... perhaps in part due to her proclivity for intense emotional and intellectual crushes on individuals and near-paranoid fears of plots against her career.\\" Details of Danner's personal life are scarce. She first married Cordell Strickland, with whom she had one child, Naomi. Danner later remarried to Otto Cunningham.Aldridge, 85.  Detroit years and Boone House  Danner moved to Detroit in 1959 to join that city's vibrant community of black writers and artists. She quickly became a part of the \\"Detroit Group,\\" which included writers such as Danner, Dudley Randall, Oliver LaGrone, Woodie King, Jr., James Thompson and Naomi Long Madgett. In 1962, Danner was named a poet- in-residence at Wayne State University.Smethurst, Black Arts Movement, 200. That same year, Danner talked a local Baptist pastor into lending her an empty parish house to found a cultural center for black writers, artists and musicians. Boone House became the artistic home of the Detroit group from 1962 to 1964 and hosted visitors such as Robert Hayden, Owen Dodson, Fuller and Hughes, who provided crucial support and publicity for several Boone House writers.James E. Smethurst and Howard Rambsby II, \\"Reform and revolution, 1965‚Äì1976: the Black Aesthetic at work,\\" The Cambridge History of African American Literature, eds. Maryemma Graham and Jerry Washington Ward (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011) 436. The Boone House group also benefited from the attention of Rosey Pool, who included Danner and four other Detroit writers in her 1962 anthology Beyond the Blues.Melba Joyce Boyd, Wrestling with the muse: Dudley Randall and the Broadside Press (New York: Columbia University Press, 2003) 109; Smethurst, ,Black Arts Movement, 207. Madgett remembered Boone House as an \\"old house [that] was beautiful in its details but in poor repair. It lacked central heat, some of the lights did not work, and the toilet lacked a seat, but we were glad to have this meeting place and to huddle together good-naturedly in front of the fireplace in cold weather.\\"Boyd 105. According to Randall, \\"At the Boone House poetry meetings we didn't criticize each other's work. It wasn't a workshop. Instead, we created a poetry community to inspire each other.\\" At Boone House, Danner and Randall collaborated on Poem Counterpoem (1966)‚Äîthe first book out of Randall's Broadside Press, an important independent black publisher still in operation today.\\"Reform and Revolution\\", 413.Broadside Press 1965‚Äì2005. In 1962 Danner was noted as \\"a fellow Bahai\\" in October 1962 in the foreword of her poem Through the Varied Patterned Lace published in the Negro History Bulletin while she lived in Detroit. She joined the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, which she shared with Robert Hayden; she was a touring poet sponsored by the Bah√° º√≠ Teaching Committee, and shared stories of her experiences promoting the religion.  Later career  In 1966, Danner took her long-desired trip to Africa through the John Hay Whitney Fellowship to join prominent African- American cultural figures at the First World Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar, Senegal.\\"Writers Seen on the Festival Scene,\\" Negro Digest 15.8 (June 1966): 50. The poem \\"At Home in Dakar\\" (also published as \\"At Home in Africa\\") recalls this trip. Danner's enthusiasm for the Black Arts Movement emerging in the mid-1960s apparently \\"blew hot and cold.\\"Smethurst, , Black Arts Movement, 333. She presented the spiritual orientation of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in some of her work. Still, she participated in conferences and readings with younger poets and generally supporting the new literary generation.Aldridge, \\"Benin to Beale Street\\", 86. As Negro Digest acknowledged in 1968, Danner's \\"poetry long had reflected the now-fashionable 'black is beautiful' philosophy.\\"\\"OBAC‚ÄîA Year Later,\\" Negro Digest 17.9 (July 1968): 92. During terms as poet-in- residence at Virginia Union University in Richmond and LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis, both historically black institutions, Danner continued her lifelong dedication to young people and edited two anthologies of students' verse.Erlene Stetson, \\"Dialectic Voices in the Poetry of Margaret Esse Danner,\\" in Black American Poets Between Worlds, 1940‚Äì1960, ed. R. Baxter Miller (Knoxville: The University of Tennessee Press, 1986), 102. In the late 1960s and 1970s, Danner published her third and fourth volumes of poetry, Iron Lace (1968) and The Down of a Thistle: Selected Poems, Prose Poems, and Songs (1976). Her work continued to draw upon African (as well as Western) art, flora and fauna, relationships with her fellow poets and scenes from urban life. Several of her poems address or discuss her grandson, Sterling Washington, Jr., whom she calls \\"Muffin,\\" and who seems to represent an African-American future. Danner continued to be visible promoting her religion. Margaret Esse Danner died on January 1, 1984, in Chicago. Her papers are held by the University of Chicago library.  Reception  \\"A word conjuror and artisan, she provides her reader with well-crafted 'word sketches' that are impressionistic and expressionistic. Her poetry, the result of a dialectic between voices of her past, present, and future, reveals her role and relation to a tradition of Western poetics; her artistic invention of poetry as a visual impression combines graphic social criticism and visual creation, that which is both didactic and mimetic, into an exciting synthesis of a new aesthetic; her verse makes her reader a viewer of art (synesthetic imagery) as well.\\" Erlene StetsonStetson, \\"Dialectic Voices\\", 93. \\"One can perceive between the two covers of this one crafted volume, in its full imaginative scope, the web of intricate and brilliant imagery her pen has spun forth in the journey of a sensitive, independent and compassionate spirit across these turbulent times in this uncertain place.\\" Samuel A.

The Bolsta Runestones are two Viking Age memorial runestones and two fragments of a third that are located in Bolsta, which is on the east edge of Uppsala, Uppsala County, Sweden, and in the historic province of Uppland. One runestone is signed by the runemaster with the normalized name of √Ösmund K√•resson and the other by the runemaster named √ñpir. U 968 Upplands Runic Inscription 968 or U 968 is the Rundata catalog listing for two fragments of a runestone that are 0.6 and 0.8 meters in height. The inscription consists of runic text carved in the younger futhark on a serpent. The inscription was recorded during the initial Swedish runestone surveys of the 1600s, but the stone later disappeared. Before the historic nature of runestones was understood, they were often reused as materials in the construction of churches, buildings, and walls. Two fragments of the stone were found in the basement of a village house in the 1880s, and are now located on private property. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr4, which also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. The runic text is based upon the recorded text from the 1600s with sections that are today missing from the two fragments shown below within brackets. The test indicates that the stone was raised as a memorial by two brothers named St√≥√∞i and Sigdjarfr and their father √ûorger√∞r in memory of a brother named Eistulfr. The runic text leaves off a conjunction ok (\\"and\\") between two of the names of the sponsors, which has been added in the transcription into Old Norse below. It has been noted that the runemasters √ñpir and √Ösmund left off a conjunction between the name of sponsors on some twenty inscriptions in Uppland, but since there are some examples of other runemasters also leaving off conjunctions, this is not a sufficient basis for attribution of the carver of U 968. pp. 148-49.

U 969 U 969 is signed by the runemaster √Ösmund. Upplands Runic Inscription 969 or U 969 is the Rundata listing for an inscription on a granite stone 1.35 meters in height. The inscription consists of runic text carved in the younger futhark on a serpent with a cross in the upper section. The inscription is classified as being carved in either runestone style Pr3 or Pr4, both of which are considered to be Urnes style. The runic text states that the stone was raised by a man named Ragnvi√∞r in memory of his father, and that the inscription was carved by the runemaster √Ösmund K√•resson. √Ösmund was active in Uppland in the first half of the 11th century. Over twenty other inscriptions are listed in Rundata as being signed by √Ösmund including U 301 in Sk√•nela, the now-lost U 346 in Fr√∂sunda, U 356 in √Ñngby, the now-lost U 368 in Helg√•by, U 824 in Holm, U 847 in V√§ster√•ker, U 859 in M√•sta, U 871 in √ñlsta, U 884 in Ingla, U 932 at Uppsala Cathedral, U 956 in Vedyxa, the now-lost U 986 in Kungsg√•rden, U 998 in Sk√§ller√∂, U 1142 in √Öbyggeby, U 1144 in Tierp, U 1149 in Fler√§ng, U Fv1986;84 in Bo g√•rd, U Fv1988;241 in Rosersberg, Gs 11 in J√§rvsta, Gs 12 in Lund, and Gs 13 in S√∂derby. In signing U 969, √Ösmund shifted the r-rune one space over to spell his name as osmunrt. pp. 208-09. He also did this in the text on inscriptions U 859, U 986, U 998, U 1149, and Gs 13. √Ösmund signed with the statement en Asmundr hio or \\"and √Åsmundr cut,\\" words that he also used on U 871.

Upplands Runic Inscription 970 or U 970 is the Rundata listing for an inscription carved on a granite stone that is 1.15 meters in height. The inscription consists of runic text carved in the younger futhark on a serpent. The stone has been damaged such that a portion of the inscription and text is missing. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr5, which is considered to be Urnes style. The runic text indicates that the stone was raised by a man named Vi√∞i or V√≠√∞i, but the name of the person to whom the stone is a memorial has been lost. The text ends with the signature of √ñpir, who was active in Uppland during the late 11th and early 12th centuries.

It formed as a suture between plates during the Pan-African orogeny, when Gondwana was formed. The Mozambique Belt includes components created when the Mozambique Ocean opened and others created when the ocean later closed.  Extent  The western portion of the Mozambique Belt is mostly composed of upper amphibolite-grade gneisses, reworked rocks from the Tanzania craton and Usagaran Belt, emplaced between 2,970 and 2,648 million years ago. The eastern portion has high-grade arc-derived rocks ranging in age from 841 to 632 million years ago. Both terranes also include Neoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks. The differences may indicate origins in two different basins, with the eastern basin rocks being thrust over those of the western basin during closure of the Mozambique Ocean between 585 and 550 million years ago.  Formation  Many geologists consider that the Mozambique Ocean formed during the break-up of Rodinia between 800 and 700 million years ago, accompanied by volcanic activity. Magmatism from this period is found in East Africa and Madagascar, although not in the southern Mozambique Belt. The ocean probably separated the Kalahari craton from the combined Congo - Tanzania craton, and separated the Madagascar-India block from the Congo-Tanzania block. The ocean began closing between Madagascar-India and Congo-Tanzania between 700 and 580 million years ago, with closure between 600 and 500 million years ago. Exposed rocks in Kenya and Tanzania include rift sediments and passive margin metasediments from the early Neoproterozoic continental margin. They also include older crustal material from the Tanzanian craton that has been reworked. At one time the belt was thought to have been caused by the collision of east and west Gondwana. According to a more recent theory, Gondwana formed over an extended period from accretion of independent terraines. The Mozambique Belt rocks formed from magmatic underplating and a period of residence in the mid-lower crust followed by cooling between 640 and 620 million years ago. The rocks were exhumed over 500 million years ago. The deeper crustal levels were elevated by the closure of the Mozambique Ocean and the upper crustal arc remnants were removed by erosion.

Sri Lanka Crowd celebrate with Sri Lankan Flag. Victory celebrations were held all over the country Streets were filled with joyous scenes of jubilation. United National Party leader Ranil Wickremasinghe, through a telephone call, congratulated President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the state's security forces on 18 May 2009 for their victory over the LTTE.

The task now facing the people of Sri Lanka is immense and requires all hands. It is most important that every effort be undertaken to begin a process of healing and national reconciliation. I listened very carefully to what President Rajapaksa said in his address to Parliament today. The legitimate concerns and aspirations of the Tamil people and other minorities must be fully addressed.\\" The Secretary General went on to announce his upcoming visit to the wartorn region. ‚Äì The European Council met in Brussels on 18 May 2009, during which it adopted a statement calling on \\"the Government of Sri Lanka urgently to proceed towards a comprehensive political process\\" and \\"the President of Sri Lanka to outline a clear process leading to a fully inclusive political solution, based on consent, equality and the rule of law\\". The Council stated that such moves are the only way toward long-term security, post-conflict reconstruction and prosperity in Sri Lanka.

India will work with the people and Government of Sri Lanka to provide relief to those affected by the tragic conflict, and to rapidly rehabilitate all those who have been displaced, bringing their lives to normalcy as soon as possible. It is our view that as the conventional conflict in Sri Lanka comes to an end, this is the moment when the root causes of conflict in Sri Lanka can be addressed. This would include political steps towards the effective devolution of power within the Sri Lankan Constitution so that Sri Lankans of all communities, including the Tamils, can feel at home and lead lives of dignity of their own free will.\\" ‚Äì Foreign Minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran Manouchehr Mottaki telephoned Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama on 19 May 2009 to extend his warm congratulations to the President, the Foreign Minister and the Government of Sri Lanka on the success achieved by Sri Lanka in defeating LTTE terrorism. \\"Iran has maintained close relations with Sri Lanka and has always condemned terrorism and, consistently upheld the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka\\". He states that he was speaking on behalf of the President of Iran who has conveyed his best wishes to Sri Lanka and will personally speak to the President of Sri Lanka at a mutually convenient time. Iran has also offered assistance through the Red Crescent, for the emergency relief operations for the IDPs in the North. ‚Äì The Japanese premier's office released a statement of Prime Minister Taro Aso's telephone conversation with Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Although the captors demanded the release of Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin for Toledano, Toledano was killed by his captors.  Background  In 1987, during the First Intifada, Hamas carried out its first attack against Israel in which two Israeli soldiers were abducted and killed. The Israel Defense Forces immediately arrested the founder of Hamas Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, and sentenced him to life in prison for masterminding terrorist attacks. Hamas then began planning the capture of an Israeli soldier in order to seek the release of Yassin in a swap.  Capture and killing  At about 4:30 am, 13 December 1992, a squad of Hamas militants kidnapped 29-year-old Israeli border policeman Senior Sergeant Nissim Toledano in Lod, as he walked from his home to attend his administrative job. During the same day Hamas demanded that Sheikh Ahmed Yassin be released the same day until 9:00 pm in exchange for Toledano. Toledano's captors threatened to kill Toledano unless Yasin would be freed. Israel refused to negotiate until it received evidence that Toledano was alive and well. Two days later, on 15 December 1992, Toledano's body was discovered near the communal Israeli settlement in the West Bank Kfar Adumim. Toledano's body was found bound and stabbed. Pathological findings indicated that Toledano was murdered two-to-six hours after the ultimatum expired. In addition, the findings indicated that the strangulation and stab wounds were not carried out at the site at which Toledano's body was discovered.  Israel's response  A few months after the event, the IDF arrested Toledano's kidnappers and killers. They were Mahmoud Issa, Majid Abu Qatish, Mahmoud Atwan, and Musa al-Akari. They were tried, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Mahmoud Issa was held in solitary confinement and for ten years between 2002 and 2012. By the time he was taken out of solitary confinement he had spent more time in solitary confinement and had been refused family visits longer than any other Palestinian prisoner.https://www.haaretz.com/after-ten-years-palestinian- prisoner-to-be-released-from-solitary-confinement-1.5220908 In response to the killing, Israel arrested during a huge manhunt operation in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. About 1,200 Palestinian fundamentalists, mostly Hamas and Islamic Jihad members, including 22 members of the Izz al-Din al Qassam Brigades, were arrested. In order to deepen the damage to Hamas' infrastructure and to its members, Israel decided, in an unprecedented step, to expel 415 Hamas members to Lebanon for a period of two years. On 17 December 1992, Israel expelled 415 leading figures of Hamas and Islamic Jihad to Marj al-Zohour in southern Lebanon, beyond the Israeli Security Zone. Among the more prominent deportees were Mahmoud al-Zahar, Abd al-Aziz Rantisi, Ismail Haniyeh, Said Siam Izz El-Deen Sheikh Khalil, Abbedallah Qawasameh, Aziz Duwaik, and Nayef Rajoub. The planned deportation gained wide media coverage, which led the Lebanese authorities to prepare in advance for the event. They prevented the deportees from entering the country, thereby forcing the deportees to stay in a desolate buffer strip between the nearest Lebanese and Israeli army checkpoints. The deportees set up a tent camp from which they received wide international media attention and coverage. In February 1993, Israel shortened the deportees' period of expulsion to one year only. Most of the deportees returned to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip after the period of expulsion ended.

It is the second spacecraft in the RAX mission. The RAX-1 mission ended after approximately two months of operation due to a gradual degradation of the solar panels that ultimately resulted in a loss of power. RAX team members applied the lessons learned from RAX-1 to the design of a second flight unit, RAX-2, which performs the same mission concept of RAX-1 (launched in November 2010) with improved bus performance and additional operational modes. Science measurements are enhanced through interactive experiments with high power ionospheric heaters where FAI will be generated on demand. RAX-2 was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in October 2011 atop a Delta II rocket. Spacecraft design With the exception of the solar panels, the designs of RAX-1 and RAX-2 are largely identical. RAX-1 and RAX-2 are standard 3U CubeSats with physical dimensions of approximately 10 cm x 10 cm x 34 cm and approximate mass of 3 kg. The satellites conform to the 3U CubeSat standard such that they can be launched from the Cal Poly P-POD, a specialized container and deployment mechanism by engineers at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo that many launch providers are able to attach as secondary payloads to their launch vehicles. Design strategy The general design strategy for RAX was to make use of commercial off-the- shelf (COTS) components to reduce development time and cost. Several of RAX's subsystems consist of a central commercial component with support electronics (power, bus communication, switches, etc.) built around it. However, there were many instances where subsystems needed to be designed from the ground up because COTS solutions did not meet mission requirements. While these instances cost the team a great deal of time and funds, the benefit was the development of in-house expertise for building customizable systems for future Michigan missions. Please see the subsystems section below for specific design details. Design implementation RAX is divided into seven subsystems, one payload, 15 total circuit boards, 7 microprocessors, and two FPGAs. The subsystem boards are designed around the PC-104 standard so that each board plugs into another at the 104-pin header from the base of the satellite up to the payload. From there, individual interconnects run from the electronics stack to the payload receiver. Aluminum rails run through each corner of the board, and threaded standoffs are located above and below to lock each board in place. The four long sides of the satellite are covered with eight solar cells each, leaving the top and bottom panels open for the communication and GPS antennas. RAX-2 is a stack of three standard 'CubeSat' modules weighing about 3 kg. The flight computer is a Texas Instruments MSP430-based while the processing of scientific data is done with a 520 MHz PXA270. Communications are by means of a UHF transceiver with downlink speeds of 38.4 kbit/s, and an S-band downlink for scientific data that provides 115.2 kbit/s downlink. Mission overview The Delta II carrying RAX-2, five other CubeSats, and the NPP Earth observing satellite, launching from Vandenberg AFB on 28 Oct 2011 The primary mission objective of RAX-2 is to study large plasma formations in the ionosphere, the highest region of our atmosphere. These plasma structures, a form of turbulence called field-aligned irregularities (FAIs), can distort communication and navigation signals such as global positioning systems (GPS). To study FAI, the RAX mission will utilize a large incoherent scatter radar in Poker Flats, Alaska (known as PFISR). PFISR will transmit powerful radio signals into the plasma instabilities that will be scattered into space. During that time, the RAX spacecraft will be orbiting overhead and recording the scatter signals with an onboard receiver. These signal recordings will be processed by an onboard computer and transmitted back to our ground stations where scientists will analyze them. The goal of this one-year science mission is to enhance our understanding of FAI formation so that short-term forecast models can be generated. This will aid spacecraft operators with planning their mission operations around periods of expected communication disruption. RAX-2 builds on the RAX-1 heritage to continue the scientific mission; it is a reflection of students learning from experience, and implementing new, more inventive technologies firsthand. RAX-2 was developed to correct the power failure and enable scientific experiments at regular intervals. Launch RAX-2 launched on October 28, 2011, as a secondary payload on NASA's NPP (NPOESS Preparatory Project) mission. The CubeSat launch was sponsored by NASA as part of the ELaNa-3 program.Educational Launch of Nanosatellites It launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in central California on a United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket, flying in the 7920-10 configuration. CubeSat separation occurred 98 minutes after launch, and beacons from RAX-2 were heard shortly thereafter. This was a multi-payload mission with five other CubeSats, M-Cubed, AubieSat-1, DICE-1, DICE-2, and Explorer-1. Mission science The objective of the RAX mission is to understand the microphysics that lead to the formation of magnetic field-aligned plasma irregularities (FAI), an anomaly known to disrupt communications with orbiting spacecraft. The RAX mission is specifically designed to remotely measure, with extremely high angular resolution, the 3-D k-spectrum (spatial Fourier transform) of ~1 m scale FAI as a function of altitude, in particular measuring the magnetic field alignment of the irregularities. The RAX mission will use a network of existing ground radars that will scatter signals off the FAI to be measured by a receiver on the RAX spacecraft. The spacecraft will measure \\"radio aurora\\", or the Bragg scattering from FAI that are illuminated with a narrow beam incoherent scatter radar (ISR) on the ground. This remote sensing method is based on the powerful mathematical relation that the radio aurora intensity is proportional to the irregularity k-spectrum evaluated at the Bragg wave number. The ground-to-space bistatic radar experiment highly resolves the k-spectrum, which means that the sensed volume of plasma is homogeneous and that the received signal contains a pure content of wave vectors, which are important for accurate analysis of wave growth and damping. Moreover, each experiment will be tagged with the convection electric field Ec, a principal driver of the irregularities, which will be measured (besides altitude profiles of plasma density and temperatures) by the ISR during an experiment. The RAX mission is a unique opportunity to quantify plasma processes in a homogeneously resolved volume of plasma with the driving force and the effect measured effectively simultaneously. Scientific discoveries and original experimental research RAX-2 successfully made the first-ever measurement of naturally occurring auroral turbulence recorded using a nanosatellite radar receiver. The distinctive radar echoes recorded on March 8 were taken with the Radio Aurora Explorer (RAX) CubeSat. The RAX nanosatellite measured turbulence over Fairbanks, Alaska that was a direct result of a geomagnetic storm triggered by the largest solar flare in the past five years. The Earth's high latitude ionosphere, a region of the upper atmosphere associated with solar- driven aurora or \\"northern lights,\\" becomes highly unstable when large currents flow during geomagnetic storms. RAX was specifically designed by SRI and the University of Michigan to measure this auroral turbulence from an orbital vantage point inaccessible to traditional ground-based radars. \\"The RAX radar echo discovery has convincingly proved that miniature satellites, beyond their role as teaching tools, can provide high caliber measurements for fundamental space weather research,\\" said Therese Moretto Jorgensen, Ph.D., Geospace program director in the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences at the National Science Foundation.

In her twenties she discovered the American \\"underground\\" comics. She did not read non-comic books until she was in her thirties, and says the Harry Potter books were the first prose books she read. She is a member of a book club, but after proposing a Robert Crumb book (too long) and one by Daniel Clowes (too experimental) is no longer allowed to bring in comic books. Much of Stok's work is autobiographical; she began drawing comics in the 1990s and self-published Barbaraal, a series of books set in Groningen, often in and around Vera, a former student organization's building and now a center for popular music. She never attended an art or design school, wary that she might lose her personal style. Her 2003 novel Je geld of je leven (\\"Your money or your life\\") deals with her work as a journalist and the burn-out that followed it. She won the 2009 Stripschapprijs for the autobiographical novel Dan maak je maar zin, which deals with the death of the author/main character's brother-in-law and probes the meaning of life. Also in 2009, Stok was commissioned by publishing company Nijgh & Van Ditmar and the Van Gogh Museum to write a book on Van Gogh. Her Vincent is a graphic novel depicting Vincent van Gogh's years in and around Arles; it is translated into a number of languages including English. James Smart, in The Guardian, praised it as \\"a vibrant, sad account of Van Gogh's move to Arles and his struggle with mental illness\\". That same year she was given a weekly slot in the national daily newspaper NRC Handelsblad.

They were also called the Steinernes Meer (\\"stony sea\\") and have an area of 40 hectares (2,000 √ó 200 metres). During a series of storm floods, 3,500 to 4,000 years ago, the stones, from the Cretaceous deposits on the Jasmund peninsula which had been broken up by the sea, were piled up here. The layer of flints is so thick that it does not allow more than a sparse vegetation layer. In 1840 the Schmale Heide was planted with a pine wood, which surrounds the flint fields today. Since 1935, when the region was given conservation status, many trees, bushes and other plant species have been able to develop undisturbed. By the middle of the 19th century and, for the last time in the mid-1970s to the early 1990s, there attempts were made to protect the 14 open flint embankments from becoming overgrown, by fencing them in in places and introducing wildlife.

Henry Dundas Trotter, portrait around 1833 Early life The third son of Alexander Trotter of Dreghorn, near Edinburgh, he was born on 19 September 1802. He entered the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth in 1815. Career In February 1818 joined the Ister at Leith. From her in May he was sent to the Eden of 26 guns, going out to the East Indies, and in her during 1819 taking part in the expedition against the pirates of the Persian Gulf, under Captain Francis Augustus Collier. In March 1821 he was moved to the Leander, flagship of Sir Henry Blackwood, by whom he was appointed acting lieutenant. On arriving in England the commission was confirmed, dating from 9 January 1823. He was then appointed to the Hussar, going out to the West Indies, and was reported by her captain, George Harris, for his conduct in the capture of pirates at the Isle of Pines. He afterwards served in the Bellette and Rattlesnake, and on 20 February 1826 was made commander into the Britomart sloop. In July 1830 he commissioned the Curlew for service on the west coast of Africa, where he was for the most part senior officer, the commander-in-chief remaining at the Cape of Good Hope. In May 1833, at Prince's Island in the Gulf of Guinea, he had intelligence of an act of piracy committed on an American brig, the Mexican,Charles Ellms, The Pirates Own Book (2008 reprint), p. 129; Google Books. the previous September, by a large schooner identified as the Panda, a Spanish slaver from Havana, and then on the coast. It was commanded by Pedro Gibert.Benjamin Homans, Army and Navy Chronicle, Volume 1 (1835), p. 102; Google Books. On 4 June he seized the Panda in the Nazareth River, but the crew escaped to the shore. After a hunt of several months, he succeeded in capturing most of them, and took possession of the Esperanza, a Portuguese schooner, which had been assisting the fugitives. The prisoners and the Esperanza he took to England. The prisoners were sent over to Salem, Massachusetts; the brig they had plundered was then in harbour, and most of them were hanged; Trotter received the thanks of the American government. Against the Esperanza there was no legal evidence; her owners instituted a prosecution against Trotter, and Lord Palmerston, then foreign secretary, agreed that the schooner should be returned to Lisbon. Trotter was called on to fit her out at his own expense. At Plymouth, however, the captains of the ships there sent parties of men who completed her refit free of cost to Trotter; and the Admiralty promoted him to post rank on 16 September 1835. For a few months in 1838 Trotter was flag-captain to Sir Philip Durham at Portsmouth. In 1840 he was appointed captain of the Albert steamer, commander of the Niger expedition of 1841, and chief of the commission authorised to conclude treaties of commerce with the local rulers. The squadron of three small steamers sailed from England in May 1841, and entered the Niger River on 13 August. In less than three weeks the other two vessels were incapacitated by fever, and obliged to return (see William Allen. Trotter in the Albert struggled on as far as Egga, where, on 3 October, he was prostrated by the fever; and, as the greater part of his ship's company was also down with it, he was obliged to turn back. He succeeded, however, in establishing some treaties. The admiralty promoted all the junior officers of the expedition, and in the following years offered Trotter the governorship of New Zealand in 1843, the command of an Arctic expedition in 1844, and the command of the Indian Navy in 1846. The state of his health, however, led him to refuse these offers, and it was not till the outbreak of the Crimean War that he accepted employment. He was then appointed commodore at the Cape of Good Hope, a post which he held for three years, during which time he succeeded in establishing the Cape Town Sailors' Home. On 19 March 1857 Trotter became a rear-admiral on the retired list. Later life He died suddenly in London on 14 July 1859, and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. Personal life He married, in November 1835, Charlotte, second daughter of Major-General James Pringle of the East India Company's service.

Meteorological history On 21 December, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Darwin, Australia, began monitoring an area of low pressure that had developed about to the northeast of Darwin. Tropical Low 04U developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the morning of 25 December and moved slowly towards the Cobourg Peninsula. The system reached Category 2 strength in the afternoon of 25 December.http://www.weatherzone.com.au/news/top-end-communities-feeling- grants-fury/19735 In the evening of 28 December the system, downgraded to a tropical low, moved back onto the waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria. The system continued to move eastward across the Cape York Peninsula and into the Coral Sea, even as the storm weakened, until Grant underwent an extratropical transition on 2 January 2012. Later on the same day, the extratropical remnant of Grant dissipated. Preparations and impact Northern Territory A gale warning was issued for Darwin and the Tiwi Islands on 24 December. The system intensified on 25 December, reaching Category 2 status in the afternoon, and a cyclone watch was declared between Dundee Beach and Nhulunbuy, with a cyclone warning issued for areas between Cape Fourcroy and Milingimbi including the Tiwi Islands.http://www.weatherzone.com.au/news/nervous-wait-as-nt-cyclone-picks- its-path/19727 The system crossed Van Diemen Gulf and made a second landfall east of Point Stuart in the early morning of 26 December. Shortly thereafter the cyclone was downgraded to Category 1, and by that afternoon it was downgraded to a tropical low as it passed Jabiru in Kakadu National Park. Jabiru Airport had received of rain by 9:00am on 26 December. On 27 December the system was moving slowly south-east across Arnhem Land, causing heavy rainfall. Ediths Fall Ridge recorded of rainfall, which produced damaging flooding. A cyclone watch was issued on 27 December from Nhulunbuy to Numbalwar, including Groote Eylandt. Flooding associated with the system in the Katherine area cut off the Stuart Highway, washed cars off bridges and derailed a train. The Adelaide‚ÄìDarwin railway was severely damaged by the derailment of the Genesee & Wyoming freight train. The Ghan was forced to stop with 200 passengers in Katherine. One week after the cyclone had passed freight companies were poised to raise transportation costs as shipping to Darwin would need to be done by road. The railway between Katherine and Darwin would be out of service until the end of January 2012. On 28 December the system moved eastward, bringing with it heavy rainfall to the Roper-McArthur River districts. Queensland A cyclone watch was issued for Queensland for coastal areas from Thursday Island to Gilbert River Mouth but was later cancelled when the system did not re-intensify to Category 1 strength. Late on 29 December the system as a tropical monsoon low was northwest of Pormpuraaw on the Cape York Peninsula before making landfall in the early morning of 30 December south of Wiepa near the aboriginal community of Aurukun. A severe weather warning was issued for the Peninsula, North Tropical Coast and Gulf Country districts. Later on 30 December the monsoon low passed Coen and out into the waters of the Coral Sea.

Johannes Symonis (Jehan Simon) HasproisAlso spelled \\"Asproys\\", \\"de Haspre\\", \\"de Haspra\\", \\"de Aspre\\" or \\"Haprose\\". (died 1428) was a French composer originally from Arras. Four of his works of music survive in four different manuscripts, and he may also have written a treatise on astrology. Career Hasprois led an itinerant life. His career began in royal courts. In 1378, in our earliest record of him, he was serving at the court of Ferdinand I of Portugal, but by 1380 he was at the court of Charles V of France. His career afterwards was in the church. In 1384 he was the petit vicaire (lesser vicar) of Cambrai Cathedral, and in the same diocese he obtained the rectorate of the parish church of Liessies, probably in 1388. He also held benefices at Arras, Rozoy in the Aisne d√©partement and Cambrai Cathedral. He left his parish between August 1390 and 1393 and went to serve as a private chaplain to Pope Clement VII at the Papal chapel at Avignon. As his name always precedes that of Johannes de Bosco, who became a chaplain in 1391, in the registers, it is likely that he was appointed chaplain earlier than 1391. Hasprois continued to serve under Benedict XIII down to 1403. He was possibly the same person as the magister Johannes Symonis who attended the Council of Constance in 1417 and wrote an essay on astrology. Hasprois served in the Roman Curia as an apostolic notary until his death in 1428. Music Hasprois's early two-voice ballade \\"Puisque je sui fumeux\\" is \\"a prime example of the exceedingly complex style of the ars subtilior.\\"G√ºnther. In the manuscript, the song is followed by the phrase \\"Jo Simon de haspre composuit dictum. Ja. de Noyon\\", meaning \\"Said to have been composed by Jo(hannes) Symon(is) Hasprois. Ja. de Noyon.\\" Some scholars have seen this as naming a certain \\"Ja. de Noyon\\" as the composer, but G√ºnther rejects this. The text of this ballade is also preserved anonymously as \\"Balade de maistre fumeux\\". It is similar to a rondeau by Solage, \\"Fumeux fume par fumee\\", and both were probably written for the \\"highly eccentric circle\\" gathered around Jean Fum√©e.This circle is described by Eustache Deschamps in his Charte des fumeux (1368). If so, then it probably dates to the time when Hasprois was at the court of Charles V. Hasprois wrote two other ballades in the tradition of courtly love as it was being expressed circa 1400. \\"Ma doulce amour\\" is preserved in three manuscripts and is the more complicated of the two. The syllabic \\"Se mes deux yeux\\" is found in only one manuscript, alongside \\"Ma doulce\\". There is also an incomplete rondeau refrain, \\"Jone, gente, joyeuse\\", with a tenor part lacking a text, ascribed to Hasprois in one manuscript. Modern scholars have suggested several anonymous compositions as having possibly been composed by Hasprois: three from the manuscript GB-Ob 213, based on style, and two songs from the so-called \\"Leiden fragments\\", because his name appears in their texts.This latter suggestion is G√ºnther's. One of these, the drinking song \\"Ho, ho, ho\\", is in the simpler early 15th-century style of Hasprois's two later ballades.

Originally built to carry the Barry Railway across a narrow gorge through which the River Taff, Taff Vale Railway and Cardiff Railway passed, it was deconstructed in 1969, leaving only two of the support columns visible from the A470 road. Background During the Industrial Revolution, and the mass-extraction of coal from South Wales, there was a resultant growth in construction of railways into the South Wales Coalfield. The Taff Vale Railway so monopolised the trade of shipping coal to Cardiff Docks, that mine owners were desperate for competitor railway companies to both improve speeds of shipping, provide access to new markets, and hence reduce shipping rates. The first section of the Taff Vale Railway (TVR) to move iron from Merthyr Tydfil to Cardiff Docks opened in 1840, and included Taffs Well railway station. Following 1858, the Rhymney Railway (RR) had connected with the TVR, south of Taffs Well station at Walnut Tree Junction, a name given to the northern area of Radyr village. Almost two miles further south, Radyr station was situated, followed by Penarth Junction, later renamed Radyr Junction. However, by 1880 the TVR and RVR were so congested with coal traffic, that a group of coal mine owners, iron makers and industrialists led by David Davies of Ocean Collieries, had all suffered from the capacity and monopoly issues created by two companies: *Taff Vale Railway: which provided the dominant rail infrastructure. Capacity issues were particularly dominant after Pontypridd railway station, where down loaded trains and up return empty wagons were restricted to a single double track route, which could not be expanded due to the geographic challenges of the valley. *Cardiff Docks: which having been developed by Lord Bute, were sufficient to serve his coal-exporting needs, but did not have sufficient capacity to cope with new mine developments. In light of the geographic restrictions of the valley south of Pontypridd, Davies proposed development of a secondary route which terminated at Barry, where a dock infrastructure could be developed without the mud flat or tidal restrictions which gave Cardiff's Tiger Bay its name. This would create a competitive edge to the development, and due to being later developed to a more easily accessible docks, a resultant efficiency advantage over Cardiff. The Barry Dock and Railway Bill was introduced in the 1883 Parliamentary session but was defeated by opposition, particularly from the Bute Docks and Taff Vale Railway. The Bill was introduced again the following year and the Barry Dock and Railway Company Act was passed on 14 August 1884 for the construction of a dock between Barry and Barry Island. The name was changed to the Barry Railway Company by an Act of 5 August 1891. Llanbradach branch By 1889 the main line of the BRC connected Barry Docks to Hafod Junction, on the Taff Vale line, south-east of Trehafod railway station, within the Rhondda Valley. However, Davis also wanted access to the Rhymney Valley and the industrial hub of Dowlais at Merthyr Tydfil, so proposed a direct branch line to Llanbradach from Tynycaeau Junction on the Cadoxton-Trehafod main line. Having already engineered the main line of the BRC, Chief Engineer Sir James Szlumper proposed that the new Llanbradach branch run from the BRC main line at Tynycaeau Junction near St Fagans, direct to the a junction with the Brecon and Merthyr Railway (BMR) at Llanbradach first known as Barry Junction (BMR) and later, Duffryn Isaf Junction. There would be no stations, allowing the freight trains to run unimpeded at full speed, but taking into account gradients and stopping for pinning down wagon brakes as necessary but hence maximising traffic revenue. After passing through the Garth Hill via the Walnut Tree Tunnel (), a siding served Dolomite Quarry, before the line curved right to reach the viaduct which bridged the River Taff valley via the congested geographical squeeze- point just north of Radyr, known as Walnut Tree. The height and form of the viaduct at this point not only needed to cope with the congested valley bottom, crossing the River Taff, but also at its north-eastern end, curve onto a shelf of rock on the eastern hillside followed by a deep cutting for ¬º mile. The railway then climbed the eastern hillside to finally route north-east to reach the Rhymney Railway via Penrhos Lower Junction, allowing access to Caerphilly. The BRC Llanbradach extension continued along the eastern side of the Taff valley, to then span the RR and the TVR via the Penrhos Viaduct, and then the Penyrheol Viaduct. Finally the line circumvented the west side of the town of Caerphilly, and crossed the Rhymney valley north of Energlyn by means of the Llanbradach Viaduct, near Pwll-y-pant, constructed to ease the gradient onto the BMR junction south of Maesycwmmer. The section from Penrhos lower Junction to the Brecon & Merthyr Junction was known as the B&M; Extension. The line from Tynycaeau Junction to Penrhos Junction was officially named the Penrhos Branch by the GWR and Successor BR Western Region and given the Engineer's Line reference PRS. The former Barry Railway's Cadoxton-Trehafod main line was given the ELR, CTD. These abbreviations still hold for remaining structures and land remaining from BR days and now in the care of the Historic Railways Estate/Highways England. Construction Facing similar problems to those that Chief Engineer Charles Liddell with the Taff Vale Extension of the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway (NA&HR;) had at the Crumlin Viaduct in spanning the Ebbw River, Szlumper surveyed the earlier structure and came to the same conclusions: *That the necessary height, created both a structural problem and a wind problem, as the valley funnelled and hence increased wind speed. *That a lack of suitable local resources meant that shipping in materials was the only option. *That a stone structure would result in an unstable and high-maintenance bridge, the thick structure of which would create additional compressed wind flow around the rail tracks, resulting in a possible safety hazard for passengers and train crew. His recommendation therefore like Liddell to the board of the BRC was for steel lattice girders spans, set atop brick-built supporting columns. The final structure, which took less than 12 months to build, opened in 1901. At its maximum high, the seven spans created a structure of long, which curved slightly at its western end to enable the line to bend onto the rock shelf. Closure and demolition Residual brick support of the Walnut Tree Viaduct, painted in honour of the Queen's Silver Jubilee, 1977 The Llanbradach branch (or B&M; Extension) enjoyed a short but productive life north of Penrhos Lower Junction as it was de-commissioned by the later owning Great Western Railway in the early 1930s, with all three viaducts on that section removed and sold for scrap by the end of 1937. Today, all that remains is a single brick arch towards the western end of where the Llanbradach Viaduct was sited. A short section of track bed remains near Energlyn, while the rest of the trackbed was incorporated into the A468 road Caerphilly bypass. Later renamed the 'Penrhos Branch' by the GWR, post-nationalisation it came under the control of British Railways. On 31 March 1963, a fire destroyed Tynycaeau Junction signal box and BR decided not to rebuild it, and hence the Penrhos Branch section from the Walnut Tree tunnel southwards to Tynycaeau Junction was maintained as its original double track but given 'long siding' status and as Steetley Dolomite workings had always necessitated a run-round by the steam locomotive, which could not be performed at the Walnut Tree West rail connection due to the permanent way layout, the loco' had to travel 'light engine' for a round trip of 7¬º miles by running to Tynycaeau Junction and crossing over from down to up line near the former junction with the Cadoxton-Wenvoe-Pontypridd line. With the signal box out of action at Tynycaeau, the crossover was modified to sprung points from down to up line. Eventually even that section was curtailed and sleeper stops placed on both lines at the Walnut Tree tunnel north portal. The double track south of Walnut Tree tunnel had been lifted by August 1965. The remaining branch was later worked as a single-track long siding from Penrhos to the Steetley Dolomite limestone quarry, just south of the viaduct, the permanent way layout having been modified. The last train to the quarry ran over the viaduct in 1967. The remaining permanent way to Penrhos yard and Junction was not lifted until the decommissioning of the whole line in 1969. By the late 1990s the tunnel was gated and by the year 2000 the quarry had breached the tunnel lining, leaving a air gap in its structure. After Welsh Office and Cardiff Council approved the dual carriageway improvement to the A470 road, British Railways agreed to close the remaining line, with two of the Walnut Tree Viaduct brick pillars in direct alignment of the road improvement. After dominating the southern end of Taffs Well for nearly 70 years, contractors started demolition of the Walnut Tree Viaduct in 1969. Delayed by the need to demolish all but one of the piers and one pillar by hand due to the congested valley bottom, by 1974 they had finished their work. Today Only the Walnut Tree tunnel abutment, an angled pillar and Taff Bank pier remain, all visible from the village and the A470. The Taff Bank pier was used in 1977 for displaying goodwill messages for the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II, with the paint still visible today. Parts of the remaining track bed are now incorporated into the Taff Trail.

Laurens Craen was active between 1638 and 1664. He was possibly the son of Pieter Craen. Biography Laurens Craen life and career is not as well known like his paintings that are well documented, a total of nineteen works are attributed to Craen. His name is mentioned in the archives of Middelburg, testifying that he was active there from 1655 till 1664. Craen was a member of the Guild of Saint Luke of Middelburg.

He depicted often objects, food items, shell-fish, wine, vegetables and fruits arranged artistically, often objects that symbolized wealth and abundance, creating a voluptuous feast. His painting have an intimate and peaceful air. The paintings' details are painted with precision and virtuosity. By gradually toning down the shades, the skillfully and precisely depicted objects within the painting appear almost real, the metals look due to the reflected light shape are cold and the fruit and textiles soft.

Early life Born in England, Macartney-Filgate was in India until the age of nine. His family returned to England in 1933 and three years later he became an admirer of documentaries after seeing the 1936 film Night Mail, which was narrated by John Grierson (the founder of the NFB) and based on a poem by W.H. Auden. Macartney-Filgate was only 15 years old at the outbreak of World War II and ultimately joined the Royal Air Force as a flight engineer, flying more than a dozen operations in Europe. He then went on to obtain a degree in politics, philosophy and economics from Oxford University, in 1946, and held down a succession of jobs before immigrating to Canada. National Film Board Macartney-Filgate, who had long admired the work of National Film Board of Canada, applied repeatedly for a job with Canada's public producer, before being hired as a scriptwriting assistant in 1954. The technical knowledge of airplanes picked up while in the RAF served him well, and he wrote commentary for sponsored films at the NFB from 1954 to 1957. He soon graduated from assistant scriptwriter to director-photographer and producer and directed his first film in 1956. Macartney-Filgate worked the NFB's Unit B, with such filmmakers as Wolf Koenig, Roman Kroitor, Stanley Jackson, Michel Brault, and Pierre Perrault, all of which were at the forefront of the new unscripted, observational documentaries. He worked extensively as a director and cinematographer on the Candid Eye series. The NFB was able to sell the series of 14 30-minute shorts to the CBC, and Candid Eye (1958‚Äì61) was broadcast. Executive producer Tom Daly oversaw the filmmakers, and the shorts were shot on location using new lightweight equipment with an emphasis on recording everyday life. Macartney-Filgate was personally responsible for seven of the fourteen films and he helped shape the series' unscripted and observational approach. Robert Drew Associates In 1960, Macartney-Filgate left the NFB and Canada to work freelance for the U.S-based. Robert Drew Associates ‚Äì Bob Drew's stable of pioneering documentarians that included Richard Leacock, D.A. Pennebaker and Albert Maysles. This group produced three films for Time-Life Broadcast that year: Yanqui, No!, Eddie (On the Pole) and Primary. He was the principal (but uncredited) cameraman on Primary, a seminal documentary about the 1960 Wisconsin Democratic presidential primary campaign between senators John F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey. Macartney-Filgate soon left Drew Associates and worked freelance throughout most of the sixties in New York City. Other notable projects In 1962, he was hired by American producer Robert Hughes to assume the direction and photography of a documentary about the poet Robert Frost when the original director, Shirley Clarke, left the project. The film, Robert Frost: A Lover's Quarrel with the World (1963), went on to win the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, with Clarke credited as the sole director, despite Macartney-Filgate directing the majority of it. He returned to the NFB briefly to work on the 1963 series Lewis Mumford on the City, co-directing four of the six films. He won a Peabody Award (the Institutional Award for Television Education) for his 1964 documentary, Changing World: South African Essay and, working again with Robert Hughes, conducted a rare interview with Vladimir Nabokov. In New York City, he worked with William Greaves, who he had previously collaborated with on the Candid Eye series, and made films for television about such writers as Harold Pinter, Marshall McLuhan and Henry David Thoreau. He returned to Canada in the late sixties and again rejoined the NFB briefly to work on the Challenge for Change series, before moving to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. At the CBC, he directed the Lucy Maud Montgomery: The Road to Green Gables (1975), Grenfell of Labrador: The Great Adventure (1977), and Fields of Endless Day (1978). Perhaps his two most accomplished films for the CBC were Dieppe 1942 (1979), which was co-written by Timothy Findley and William Whitehead and was nominated for seven Genie Awards, and Timothy Findley: Anatomy of a Writer (1992), which won the Donald Brittain Award for best social/political documentary program at the 1993 Gemini Awards. Macartney-Filgate also won two Canadian Film Awards for Blood and Fire (1958) and The Hottest Show on Earth (1977) and received an Ontario Film Institute Award in 1981. In the 1970s, Macartney-Filgate taught at the Department of Film, York University in Toronto, when James Beveridge was Chair of the Department. While still a student, Jennifer Hodge de Silva worked with Macartney-Filgate as assistant director and associate producer on Fields of Endless Day, \\"one of the first Canadian productions to significantly chronicle nearly 400 years in the history of African Canadians.\\" In 1979 she was associate producer for Dieppe 1942. Retirement In retirement, after 1990, he continued to work with Adrienne Clarkson on her arts show for CBC Television, Adrienne Clarkson Presents. In 1995 he worked with the NFB once again, directing Canada Remembers, a 3-part series about Canada's role in World War II. In 2007, he completed Raising Valhalla, a television documentary about the opening of a new opera stage at the Four Seasons Centre for Performing Arts. Now an advocate of small-format video, he continues to work freelance, based in Toronto. Honor In May 2011 Macartney-Filgate was given Hot Doc's outstanding achievement award, which included a retrospective of his work.

It is attested in what appears to be two dialects, based on word lists of about 250 lexical items, presumably collected around 1870‚Äì90. Background In Walter William Skeat and Charles Otto Blagden's 1906 work \\"Pagan Races of the Malay Peninsula\\", the contents of three previously unpublished wordlists appear, two of which were collected by D.F.A. Hervey, a former government official in Malacca. There is no indication as to when these word lists were collected; however, there is a possibility that these wordlists were collected around the 1870s to 1890s. Hervey collected his Kenaboi lexicon in Alor Gajah, Melaka from speakers living in Gunung Dato', Rembau District, which is a small inland mountainous area in southern Negeri Sembilan. Based on the ethnonym, the Kenaboi may have originated from the Kenaboi River valley of Jelebu District, northern Negeri Sembilan (Hajek 1998). Today, the Orang Asli of Negeri Sembilan are primarily Temuan speakers. Classification John Hajek (1998) proposes that Kenaboi is a mixed language of both Aslian and Austronesian origins, with Kenaboi (dialect 1) having a higher proportion of Austroasiatic words than Kenaboi (dialect 2). Kenaboi (dialect 1) also has many words of unknown origin, such as mambu 'white' and par 'water'. Hajek (1998) speculates that the lexical aberrancy of Kenaboi 1 may due to the fact that Kenaboi 1 was a special taboo language, while Kenaboi 2 was the regular non-taboo language. The lexicon of Kenaboi 1 is 47% Austroasiatic, 27% Austronesian, and 26% unclassified out of a total of 216 words. Hammarstr√∂m, et al. note in Glottolog that Kenaboi is best considered to be a language isolate, and do not consider arguments of Kenaboi as a taboo- jargon (argot) to be convincing. Skeat and Blagden (1906) considers Kenaboi as an isolate unrelated to Austroasiatic and Austronesian. Rasa, another extinct language documented in Skeat & Blagden (1906) near Rasa in Ulu Selangor, also has many words of uncertain origin (Phillips 2012: 257-258).

ERM is the process of adopting controlling methods and practices to regulate employee relations. One of the main goals associated with employee relationship management focuses on establishing and retaining productive relationships of employees within a company. A big component of ERM is effective organizational communication. This leads to the build of employee confidence, trust and loyalty. By effectively managing relationships, a company can determine whether or not a companies objectives are being met. Employee relationship management has focused on enabling employees to collaborate on typical managerial tasks with their employers. By engaging inputs from both sides of the employment relationship, ERM platforms aim to align the interests of both parties, worker and employer, and inform day-to- day business functions under a streamlined workflow. Components and functions In analyzing the concept of Employee Relationship Management, it is imperative that one understands the multiple components and functions of ERM to build strong employee-company relationships. These components and functions may include, but are not limited to: * Job postings (5) * Interview process (1) * Candidate selection (5) * New employee orientation * New employee on-boarding programs (5) * Training and professional development (5) * Supervision policies and procedures (1) * Employee assistance programs (5) * Employee engagement (8) * Equity, inclusion, and diversity initiatives * Robust internal and external communication systems http://en.kioskea.net/contents/211-employee-relationship-management-erm * Compensation and benefits packages (1) * Performance management system (8) * Conflict resolution policies and procedures http://en.kioskea.net/contents/211-employee-relationship-management-erm * Employee separation or termination process After considering these components and functions that are essential to comprehending ERM, one must look at this concept in relation to the employee life cycle.  Developing Solid Employee Relationship Management Systems for On-boarding  Strong employer-employee relations begin with the marketing of jobs to candidates and the way in which a company discusses what it is like to work for the company. This means that there is not simply a posting of a job description on a job board, but discussion about what the experience of working for the company is like, as well as the type of contributions the company is looking for in their ideal candidate. Additionally, the ease of applying must be considered for the candidate while ensuring that enough information is being gathered for the employer. We must then look at the role that technology now plays in building this relationship with candidates and the organization. Based on the size and operating budget for the recruitment process, some companies now utilize artificial intelligence systems to run resumes. As a result, it is crucial that these systems have analytics that properly capture the company‚Äôs ideal candidate. Furthermore, the company must balance the value of human contact for candidates to ensure their interest is maintained in the job. Furthermore, it is valuable to look at how hiring managers are trained in the interview process. They must demonstrate competency about ‚Äúthe legal do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts of interviewing,‚Äù to protect the company, themselves, and safeguard candidates as well (1). The balance of enough time to select the ideal candidate, while valuing the other side for candidates so that they do not move on to another opportunity must be applied. Procedures for hiring like phone screens, 1st round interviews, 2nd round interviews, and final interviews are considered necessary to communicate not only to managers, but prospective employees too. Once this selection is made, the orientation component arises and the experience that the new employee will have. The company demands of a new employee acquiring as much knowledge as possible with time constraints in mind, must be well balanced. Many organizations focus on the idea that an employee must walk away with just the idea of ‚Äúhow things are done around here,‚Äù (5) but there is increased research that shows the incorporation of ‚Äúpersonal-identity socialization‚Äù in orientation will lead to stronger employer-employee relations. This active learning experience aligns strongly with Adult Learning Theory for new employees to master job responsibilities. Training and professional development departments must strategically think about training schedules for new employees that engages them to understand the company, while embracing them as individuals. Make sure that employees feel welcomed into the new environment and the on-boarding period allows for relationship building activities throughout the company at the start. Managers must ensure that the resources provided to the new employee, such as a schedule, presentation materials, contact information, electronic accounts information, and a list of frequently asked questions. To continue building a positive experience, the new employee‚Äôs office environment should be inviting and well-resourced with materials, ultimately contributing to solid ERM. A mentor, coach, or colleague being assigned to each new employee shows that they have an individual outside of their manager to get them acclimated to the company and answer the wide array of questions. Taking into consideration all these parts of employee on-boarding process will assist in building a robust employer-employee relationship. With new generations entering the workforce, companies should begin to build on the employee‚Äôs strengths to develop stronger ERM, in turn increasing productivity. From there the company can help the employee translate these strengths to their job responsibilities. The idea of building an orientation around an employee‚Äôs strengths will empower, engage, and develop a positive employee relationship management(5).  Developing Strong Employee Relationship Management During Employee Tenure  The Bureau of Labor Statistics released figures stating that ‚Äúmore than 63 million people changed or separated from their jobs in 2017‚Äù (Edler 2018). This figure alone demonstrates the need for companies to continue to focus on building their employee relations programs in order to keep their workforce engaged and satisfied. After all, on-boarding a new employee has high operational costs that can be avoided by investing in the ERM to retain employees. In thinking about strengthening the foundation of the ERM, the Journal of Business offers seven constructs that should be considered to build a firm relationship. This begins with cooperation and the degree the employee feels is a strong sign of the relationship‚Äôs strength. The next area is ensuring the feeling of balanced power, followed by strong communication. Fourth is the feeling of attachment and how an employee feels supported in their workplace. subsequently is the idea that the employer and employee have shared goals and values. Finally, there is the idea of trust and the absence of damaging conflict. Considering all these areas of the employer-employee relationship will only strengthen the employee relations bond (8). One of the most crucial areas to pay attention to the training and professional development program. Employees need to feel that they have opportunities in front of them to increase their own human capital and build a competitive advantage. Employers can foster this through a variety of training programs internally or through external training offerings. This may come in the form of attending a conference, certificate programs, or homing in on employees‚Äô strengths to have them become trainers within the company. Creating robust training programs will assist in building a firm employee relations program (8). Another area of focus to maintain strong ERM is ensuring the company is offering the best compensation and benefits package on the market. As healthcare costs continue to rise, it is imperative that companies analyze the best coverage they can offer from employees and their families, as well as absorbing as much of the cost themselves that they can afford. This leads into the discussion of the employer contribution to benefits and how this is a key ingredient to high retention of employees. This may come in the form of other offerings like employer contributions to retirement plans, discounted memberships to gyms, tuition remission programs, or other perks programs. Compensation must also be analyzed continuously to retain the best talent and understand whether the employer or employee has the pull in the job market. A comprehensive performance management system company wide with measurable goals and a clear compensation structure will assist in equal opportunity practice. Next, the company must ensure they have knowledgeable managers and supervision procedures. In doing so, managers should be trained to respond versus react to employees to provide the highest level of support. The company should have a standard supervision offering that meets on a consistent basis formally and training to managers on how to coach on the front line. It is imperative that the employee‚Äôs ideal feedback style is considered because there is no one size fits all. In fact, with new generations entering the workforce, evidence shows that they respond better to in the moment constructive feedback (10). After considering how managers are trained, the company must develop clear procedures on handling conflict to ensure an equal opportunity for all. The procedure for handling grievances should be written in the employee handbook with easy access and simple steps to manage the conflict. A neutral party like human resources should always be involved in any conflict to guarantee fair practice. Finally, the development of multi-tiered committees is beneficial to enhancing the ERM. One such committee might be an employee appreciation one with members at different levels of the organizational hierarchy. Events should be held on a consistent basis to maintain a high moral, with awards being presented to recognize productivity. These can be held with just employees or with families as well. Equity, Inclusion, and Diversity committees are also very important to have at companies to foster a strong bond between the employer and employee. These two committees are great starting points for any company to increase employee relations, but there are also may other ways to expand to continue to build the relationship. Taking into consideration all these facets of employee relationship management will guarantee strong relations at any company.

Roosevelt's second term. The Democratic Party lost 72 seats, mostly to the Republican Party, in the House of Representatives. The Democrats also lost seven seats to the Republicans in the U.S. Senate. The election was a defeat for Roosevelt, as the conservative coalition (an alliance of Republicans and Southern Democrats) took control of Congress and stymied Roosevelt's domestic agenda. Roosevelt had campaigned openly against members of his own party who had not supported the New Deal, but Roosevelt's preferred candidates met with little success across the country. The election took place in the aftermath of the recession of 1937‚Äì38 and the defeat of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937 (\\"the court- packing plan\\"), and President Roosevelt was at the nadir of his popularity. Republicans picked up Congressional seats for the first time since the start of the Great Depression, and few new major domestic programs became law until the advent of the Great Society in the 1960s.

The line was opened by the District Railway (DR) on 5 July 1871. The tracks formed a triangle across the end of the ‚à® connecting the District's existing routes from Earl's Court station to Gloucester Road and High Street Kensington, and ran in a cutting parallel to the Metropolitan Railway (MR). The name derives from Cromwell Road which is immediately south of the site of the curve. The Cromwell Curve (centre of three cuttings heading north) The track was opened without Parliamentary authority in an attempt by the DR to increase its share of the revenues from the Inner Circle (now the Circle line), which were divided on the basis of mileage of track owned by the DR and the MR. Sir John Fowler arbitrated the dispute, ruling on 27 July that Inner Circle receipts were to be divided 67% to the Metropolitan and 33% to the District (revised to 50:50 in 1878, due to increased traffic from the District's western lines). Although the Cromwell Curve was used only occasionally, the dispute between the two companies continued until 1903, when the matter was finally decided in favour of the Metropolitan. The long curve was closed in 1956 and the tracks are no longer in place. In 1957 the site was used for the West London Air Terminal.

It lies in the municipality of Binz and is bounded to the northwest by the lagoon of the Kleiner Jasmunder Bodden and to the east by the bay of Prorer Wiek.  Formation  The shape of the heavily segmented coastline of R√ºgen was the result of interplay between variations in the mean sea level and rebound processes following the last ice age, the Weichselian glaciation. It is believed that the region of the present-day West Pomeranian Baltic Sea coast after the last ice age glacial advance (the North R√ºgen-East Usedom Step) has remained ice-free and largely part of the mainland for about 13,000 years. The level of the world's oceans was once lower than today due to the ice age. About 9,000 years ago, a meltwater lake, the Ancylus Lake, was formed, whose surface lay no higher than 8 metres below the present-day level (Normalnull), but after a period of about 1,000 years this drained, rapidly at times, into the world's oceans, which led to a renewed mainland phase, the Ancylus transgression. Not until 8,000 years ago ‚Äì after a general rise in worldwide sea levels ‚Äì did the level of water in the Baltic Sea basin climb rapidly again, by around 15 metres, after the flooding of the land bridge between Denmark and Scandinavia to form the Litorina Sea, reaching almost its present level about 5,500 years ago. Flint fields near Neu Mukran Since that time the sea level has varied by only around 1‚Äì2 metres and a process of coastal equalisation (K√ºstenausgleichsprozess) began that continues to the present day. In particular, the coastal cliffs of R√ºgen have been eroded by breakers and sea currents and the sediments dumped sand and gravel between the island cores as bars and spits. The Schmale Heide lies in an old glacial snout lake (Gletscherzungenbecken) between the island cores of Jasmund and Granitz. As geological bores near Prora in the middle of the spit have shown, the waves of the Ancylus Lake had already laid an 11 metre thick layer of sediment that was later increased again by a further 10 metres by the Litorina Sea. During this process one beach was deposited after another which is how the spit of the Schmale Heide reaches its present width of about 2 kilometres. During intermediate phases the currents and waves deposited material ‚Äì in thicker layers than today ‚Äì made of flint nodules (paramoudra) which were washed from the chalk cliff of the Jasmund Peninsula. This led to the formation of the unique flint fields near Neu Mukran in the north of the Schmale Heide, that have been placed under conservation protection since 1935.  Nature reserves  View over the flint fields The conservation aim of the Schmale Heath and Flint Fields nature reserve focuses mainly on the preservation of approximately 14 open flint ridges covering an area of 2000 x 200 metres. To suppress the spread of vegetation here, parts of the flint fields were fenced in as early as the mid-19th century and populated with game in order to keep the vegetation down after the Schmale Heide was afforested with pine in 1840. From the mid-1970s to early 1990s, this was tried again using European mouflon. Currently, the flint fields are accessible across their entire extent. East of the flint fields in 1994, a new nature reserve, the Schmale Heath and Flint Fields - Extension was created, which protects the dune area near the beach where rare plants form part of the existing vegetation. Within this area visitors must keep to the signed routes to protect the sensitive dune vegetation.  Influences on the landscape  The landscape of the Schmale Heide - in contrast to the Schaabe - has been strongly affected since the 1930s by the construction of the Nazi \\"Strength Through Joy\\" resort of Prora and subsequent decades of military use with its associated infrastructure. In addition to the 5-kilometre-long complex of buildings along the Prorer Wiek, which served in part as a barracks, large areas of the heath and the Prora, a wooded ridge in the southern part of the Schmale Heide, were used as military training areas and for the establishment of ammunition depots, hangars and workshops. The beach on the Prorer Wiek which has become accessible again since the early 1990s has regained its popularity as a bathing beach.

Only one was built but after an abortive flight development was abandoned. Design and development Designed by J.D. North, the Grahame-White Type VI was a pusher configuration unequal-span biplane. The tail surfaces were carried on three steel tube booms, with the single upper boom passing through the propeller shaft and the lower pair to the rear of the undercarriage. The propeller was driven by a large-diameter tubular driveshaft and a duplex chain, the propeller being mounted at the top of the rear of the nacelle. There were no centre-section cabane struts, the upper wing being supported solely by the interplane struts. The engine was mounted at the front of the rectangular section nacelle behind a specially made curved radiator, with two crew members seated either side and the pilot seated behind them. The control wires for the tail surfaces were carried inside the upper boom, an arrangement credited to Horatio Barber, for whose Aeronautical Syndicate Ltd North had worked. The aircraft was armed with a Colt .30-calibre machine gun on a flexible mounting at the front of the nacelle. While it was originally intended to be powered by a Austro-Daimler 6 cylinder inline, it was shown at the 1913 Olympia Aero Exhibition fitted temporarily with a Austro-Daimler instead. Only one attempt was made to fly the Type VI. The underpowered aircraft only just managed to clear the hedge at the boundary of the airfield, and made a forced landing in the next field.Brew 2002, pp. 5‚Äì6.

The Tanzania Craton is an old and stable part of the continental lithosphere in central Tanzania. Some of the rocks are over 3 billion years old. Setting The Tanzania Craton forms the highest part of the East African Plateau. The craton is surrounded by Proterozoic mobile belts of various ages and grades of metamorphism. These include the Ubendian, Usagaran, Karagwe-Ankolean and Bukoban systems. The Mozambique Belt lies to the east. The craton divides the east and west branches of the East African Rift. The southern end of the Gregory Rift Valley terminates against the craton. The volcanic area of this rift covers the surface interface between the Mozambique orogenic fold belt and the Tanzania Craton. A superplume exists beneath the craton. An indirect effect of rift and plume associated volcanism in the Tanzania Craton is the high levels of soil nutrients in Serengeti provided by volcanic ash from Ol Doinyo Lengai. Composition The craton is a composite of several different terranes of Archaean metasediments. The Dodoman is the oldest, and others include the Nyanzian and Kavirondian. Some of the greenstone belts are more than 3 billion years old. They were intruded by granites and migmatized in different events that date back to 2.9, 2.7, 2.4 and 1.85 billion years ago. The craton mainly consists of Archaean granitic complexes, but also includes rocks from the Dodoma System in the central area, and belts of greenstone to the south and east of Lake Victoria. Gneisses, schists, quartzites, migmatites, amphibolites and granulite are also found. There was widespread intrusion of kimberlites in the Cretaceous Period, mostly in the part of the craton that lies south of Lake Victoria. This includes the Mwadui kimberlite pipe in the center of Tanzania.

Geography The Brochet River upstream of the Freligh mill in Frelighsburg. The stream's source is in Quebec on the south side of Mount Pinacle. After flowing into Vermont it receives the outflow of Lake Carmi and flows back into Quebec for the remainder of its course. The main town of the watershed is Bedford but the municipalities of Saint-Armand, Notre-Dame-de-Stanbridge, Saint-Ignace-de-Stanbridge, Pike River (the eponymous municipality) and Frelighsburg.

From the border, the river flows 5.1 km north north to Selby Creek (coming from the northeast); then 1.4 km north-west to the village bridge at Frelighsburg. North of the border, the river crosses a series of falls and rapids) interspersed with long, slow-flowing sections, crossing Frelighsburg, Stanbridge East and Bedford before leaving the Appalachians to reach the plain of St. Lawrence Lowlands. A series of close falls are contained by five dams. Further downstream, the course of the river becomes winding, making a long detour via Notre-Dame-de-Stanbridge, then crossing the last rapids at Pike River to finish its course through swampy forests. The Brochets River is a tributary of the northeast shore of Missisquoi Bay in Quebec.Atlas of Canada from the Department of Natural Resources Canada - Characteristics extracted from the geographic map, the database and site instrumentation - accessed on = May 10, 2020. The main watershed municipality is Bedford but the municipalities of Saint-Armand, Notre-Dame-de-Stanbridge, Saint-Ignace-de-Stanbridge, Pike River and Frelighsburg are also included.  Toponymy  Formerly, this river was designated by its English version \\"Pike river\\". The toponym \\"Rivi√®re aux Brochets\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec.Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec - Bank of place names - Toponym: \\"Rivi√®re aux Brochets\\"  Ecology  The mouth of Rivi√®re-aux-Brochets is a biological reserve. Until the late 2000s, however, the water in the bay was stagnant and the bay was dying, contaminating large American portions of the lake confined by the numerous embankments of disused railways (Carry Bay, The Gut, Sandbar State Park, Allen Point.) When the new bridge opened on the American side between East Alburg and Lakewood, the old road on the dyke was partially demolished, which made it possible, during the spring breakup and during heavy rains, a certain flow of water to \\"Grand Lac Champlain\\" (25 nautical miles - 46km - from there). In September 2014, the UPA's media body \\"La Terre de chez nous\\" reported that blue-green algae was contaminating the Bedford water treatment plant. With global warming, this problem tends to become recurrent. It is likely to worsen as long as the flow remains slowed down by the railway rights-of-way or until it is evacuated artificially, for example by connecting the outlet of the McPhee stream (at the limit of Clarenceville and Venice-in-Quebec) with the South River further north, some 12 km away. This excavation could give rise to a small navigation channel to allow boaters to get to the Richelieu River without passing through the United States.

The port's facilities span three municipalities ‚Äî Charleston, North Charleston, and Mount Pleasant ‚Äî with five public terminals owned and operated by the South Carolina Ports Authority (SPCA). These facilities handle containers, motor vehicles and other rolling stock, non- containerized goods and project cargo, as well as Charleston's cruise ship operation. Additional facilities in the port are privately owned and operated, handling bulk commodities like petroleum, coal and steel. Early history Charleston's earliest history is tied to its prominence as a center of trade. After establishing Charles Towne along the banks of the Ashley River in 1670, the original settlers moved to the Charleston peninsula, favoring that location's natural harbor. By 1682 Charles Towne was declared the port of entry for the colony. From the founding of the colony until the start of the American Civil War, the colony's principal exports were lumber and naval stores, furs and animal skins, rice, indigo, cotton, and tobacco; and imports of primarily human traffic up until the late 1700s. As a result of this trade, the colony flourished. The Port of Charleston later suffered in the wake of the Civil War. The harbor itself was in shambles and filled with mines and the wrecks of sunken Confederate and Union ships. The Southern economy had little to export and Charleston's network of private wharves were neglected and left to ruin. The establishment of several major federal military bases during the early 20th century benefited Charleston Harbor tremendously. Because of this federal presence, the harbor itself was well-maintained and greatly improved over the years. Mayor John P. Grace brought renewed interest in reviving the Port of Charleston's shipping presence by establishing the Port Utilities Commission in the early 1920s. In 1922 the city purchased the Charleston Terminal Company, which owned the majority of the peninsula's commercial waterfront assets, for $1.5 million. In 1942, the South Carolina Legislature established the South Carolina Ports Authority with the responsibility to foster waterborne commerce for the benefit of the State of South Carolina.  Ranking, Volume and Investments  In 2019, the Port of Charleston ranked as the 8th port in the United States by cargo value, with over $75 billion in imports and exports traded across the docks. The Port of Charleston hosts shipping services by all of the globe‚Äôs top container carriers. In fiscal year 2020, the Port of Charleston handled 2.3 million twenty-foot equivalent container units (TEUs). The South Carolina Ports Authority plans to invest $1.6 billion in new and existing facilities over a 10-year period. This plan includes a new container terminal in North Charleston on the former Navy Base, as well as major improvements to existing facilities, technology upgrades, and two inland ports. Today the Port of Charleston boasts the deepest water in the southeast region and regularly handles post-Panamax vessels passing through the newly expanded Panama Canal. A next-generation harbor deepening project is currently underway to take the Port of Charleston's entrance channel to 54 feet and harbor channel to 52 feet at mean low tide. With an average high tide of 6 feet, the depth clearances will become 60 feet and 58 feet respectively. In response to the growth in traffic at both Charleston and the Port of Savannah, the Jasper Ocean Terminal is planned to be built on the Savannah River by 2035.  Terminals in the Port of Charleston  *Union Pier Terminal: This facility, located in the City of Charleston and also home of cruise ship operations, handles forest products, metals, heavy equipment, project cargo and other traditional break-bulk commodities on of berth at a depth of MLW of .

The facility features 11,316 grounded and 2,854 wheeled container slots with 538 reefer slots. *Hugh K. Leatherman Sr. Terminal: This facility, located in the City of North Charleston, will open in 2021 and will handle container cargo. The new facility will increase port capacity by 50%. Big Ship Ready The South Carolina Ports Authority (SCPA) is investing hundreds of millions of dollars into the Port of Charleston and constructing a new port terminal. On March 2, 2018, construction officially began to deepen Charleston's harbor from 45 to 52 feet deep, with completion expected within the decade. On October 4, 2020, the CMA CGM Brazil, the largest container ship to ever call the U.S. East Coast, made Charleston its last port of call in the United States before heading back to Asia. The ship is 1,200 feet long, can haul as many as 15,072 containers, and is part of the weekly Ocean Alliance Columbus JAX service. The Brazil shipped out of Yantian, China, made stops in New York and New Jersey, Norfolk, Virginia, Savannah, Georgia, and South Carolina, before returning to Asia. U.S. Ports have made plans to expand following the $5.4 billion Panama Canal shipping lane that opened in 2016.  Cruise Terminal and Union Pier Redevelopment  Cruise operations in the Port of Charleston are part of the South Carolina Ports Authority‚Äôs legislated mandate to increase maritime commerce. A study commissioned by the South Carolina Ports Authority projected that cruise operations could support 407 jobs and $37 million in economic benefits in 2010 in the Tri-County. In May 2010, the Carnival Fantasy began home-porting the Carnival Fantasy in the Port of Charleston, until February 2016, when the Carnival Fantasy was replaced by the Carnival Ecstasy. In May 2019, the Carnival Sunshine began home-porting in the Port of Charleston, replacing the Carnival Ecstasy. To better handle ships, passengers, traffic and security requirements, the Ports Authority identified a need to improve and enhance the cruise terminal, which opened in 1973. Cruise ships have called Union Pier since 1913. The Ports Authority began hosting meetings, telling the community on how the agency envisioned to best develop an improved cruise facility. Through an extensive public process, including more than 100 meetings with neighbors and other stakeholder groups, the resulting Union Pier Concept Plan, which calls for the refurbishment of an existing warehouse on the North end of Union Pier, was endorsed unanimously by City Council in September 2010 and approved by the City of Charleston Board of Architectural Review.

Coss, 532 U.S. 394 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case decided in 2001. The case concerned a federal prisoner who sought to challenge his current sentence by arguing it was enhanced based on an unconstitutional prior conviction. A divided Court held that such challenges could not be brought. The decision was based on a reading of the statute in question, not a Sixth Amendment constitutional analysis. Background Edward R. Coss, Jr., had an extensive criminal record. By the age of 16 he had been \\"adjudged a juvenile delinquent on five separate occasions\\". In October 1986, Coss was convicted in Pennsylvania state court of assault, vandalism, and criminal mischief. He was sentenced to two consecutive prison terms of six months to one year. A habeas challenge, based on a claim that his trial attorney was constitutionally ineffective, was never ruled on by state courts. After serving these sentences, he was convicted of aggravated assault in 1990. The court enhanced his sentence based on the prior conviction. A new habeas action against this trial was based on an argument that the enhancement relied on an unconstitutional prior conviction. Both the federal district court and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the enhancement was not permissible. The state prosecutors petitioned the United States Supreme Court to hear an appeal through a writ of certiorari. Opinion of the Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the majority opinion of the Court which reversed the decision of the Third Circuit. As the basis for the habeas challenge was Title 28, Section ¬ß2254 of the United States Code, each element of that section had to be fulfilled in order to gain relief (a reduction in sentence). The first element was that the petitioner is \\"in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court\\", a status that Coss could not fulfill as he was not serving his 1986 sentences any longer. Additionally, the claim was not properly raised because the original sentence was \\"no longer open to attack\\". Other parts of the majority opinion regarding Sixth Amendment claims did not control a majority of the Court, thus the judgment of the Third Circuit was simply reversed. Dissenting opinions =Souter's dissent= Justice Souter wrote a dissent which was joined by Justices Ginsburg and Stevens. Souter argued that because there was never a decision on the constitutionality of the original trial, the issue of \\"adverse effect\\" could still be raised. =Breyer's dissent= Another dissenting opinion in the case was authored by Justice Stephen Breyer. His short, one- paragraph opinion, argued that because the state has \\"failed to argue that the ... consideration of the 1986 convictions were harmless\\" there was no reason to overturn the Third Circuit's findings. This was a different reason than the Souter dissent, which is why he did not join it. See also * Habeas corpus * Daniels v.

Raga is represented in the Buddhist artwork (bhƒÅvacakra) as the bird or rooster. Raga (lobha) is identified in the following contexts within the Buddhist teachings:Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 715-718. * One of the three poisons within the Mahayana Buddhist tradition. * One of the three unwholesome roots within the Theravada Buddhist tradition * One of the six root kleshas within the Mahayana Abhidharma teachings * One of the fourteen unwholesome mental factors within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings Definitions RƒÅga literally means \\"color or hue\\" in Sanskrit, but appears in Buddhist texts as a form of blemish, personal impurity or fundamental character affliction. As a philosophical concept, the term refers to \\"greed, sensuality, desire\\" or \\"attachment to a sensory object\\". It includes any form of desire including sexual desire and sensual passion, as well as attachments to, excitement over and pleasure derived from objects of the senses. Some scholars render it as \\"craving\\". Raga is one of three poisons and afflictions, also called the \\"threefold fires\\" in Buddhist Pali canon, that prevents a being from reaching nirvana. To extinguish all \\"Raga\\" (greed, lust, desire, attachment) is one of the requirements of nirvana (liberation) in Buddhism. The Abhidharma-samuccaya states: :What is craving (raga)? It is attachment to the three realms of existence. Its function consists of engendering suffering. Raga is said to arise from the identification of the self as being separate from everything else.Ringu Tulku (2005), p. 29 This mis-perception or misunderstanding is referred to as avidya (ignorance).

The serial is based on Arthur Conan Doyle's 1902 Sherlock Holmes novel The Hound of the Baskervilles. The music score was composed and conducted by Carl Davis.  Production  This production of Doyle The Hound of the Baskervilles was the second multi-part BBC adaptation, following Peter Cushing's two-part episode for the 1968 television series. The 1982 serial was part of the BBC's Sunday Classics strand of period dramas and literary adaptations. The serial was a reunion for star Tom Baker, producer Barry Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks who had worked together on Doctor Who. The film aired as a four-part serial in 1982. As the Fourth Doctor, Baker had appeared in a 1977 serial entitled The Talons of Weng-Chiang wherein the Doctor was dressed as Sherlock Holmes complete with deerstalker. Terence Rigby, who portrayed Watson in this production, later played Inspector Layton in the 1983 version of The Sign of Four featuring Ian Richardson as Sherlock Holmes. The serial was shot in the BBC's Birmingham studios with exterior shots filmed on Dartmoor for film inserts. In his later autobiography, Baker claimed \\"the dog who had been engaged by the BBC to play the hound was gentler than Mother Teresa\\" and had to be coaxed with sausages to attack Nicholas Woodeson.

Baker himself came to consider his performance a failure saying: \\"I couldn‚Äôt lift the character into that special world that makes Holmes so funny and fascinating.\\" The Daily Telegraph described the adaptation as a \\"traditional take on Holmes's most famous adventure\\" and while it selected Baker as 15th in a countdown of \\"the 20 greatest Sherlock Holmes\\", it said Baker \\"may have been better off staying in the TARDIS\\", arguing that he gave \\"an oddly flat performance\\". The Independent has been more favourable, stating \\"it was inspired casting to put the tall, pop-eyed, mad-voiced Baker into the Holmesian cape and hat\\", describing him as \\"a predictably larger-than-life Holmes\\".  DVD  The serial was released in Australia on 20/08/2014 by Madman Entertainment. Special features include a commentary by Tom Baker.

Previously known as the South African Coloured Rugby Football Board, SARU was a founder member of the South African Council on Sport and so strongly opposed the inter-racial structures of the South African Rugby Board (SARB). After the end of apartheid SARU combined with SARB in 1992 to form the South African Rugby Football Union, now known as the South African Rugby Union. SARU's predecessor was the South African Coloured Rugby Football Board, founded in 1897 during South Africa's British colonial period as a national rugby governing body for players of colour. The SACRFB emerged from a meeting of all clubs and unions called to Kimberley by the Griqualand West Colonial Rugby Football Union. Black administrators like Bud Mbelle had earlier persuaded Cecil John Rhodes to provide a trophy like the Currie Cup to \\"'all the coloured Sporting People if South Africa'\\". The SACRFB then organized a domestic rugby competition for the Rhodes Cup, which started in 1898 and was first won by Western Province. After the South African Rugby Football Federation broke away from the Coloured Rugby Football Board to ally themselves with the white South African Rugby Board in 1966, the remaining members changed the name to the South African Rugby Union (not to be confused with the current body of that name). In 1973 SARU became a founding member of the anti-apartheid South African Council on Sports, whose slogan argued that there could be no normal sport in an abnormal society. SARU's predominantly coloured composition changed when they were joined by the mostly black Kwazakhele Rugby Union (Kwaru), itself a breakaway from the Port Elizabeth African Rugby Board. Kweru had initially wanted to affiliate with the black South African African Rugby Board but were rebuffed. Other black sporting bodies then followed Kwaru's lead.

Extrinsic denotes their location outside the hand. Extensor denotes their action which is to extend, or open flat, joints in the hand. They include the extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL), extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB), extensor digitorum (ED), extensor digiti minimi (EDM), extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU), abductor pollicis longus (APL), extensor pollicis brevis (EPB), extensor pollicis longus (EPL), and extensor indicis (EI). Origins Origin The extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) has the most proximal origin of the extrinsic hand extensors. It originates just distal to the brachioradialis at the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus, the lateral intermuscular septum, and by a few fibers at the lateral epicondyle of the humerus. Distal to this, the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB), extensor digitorum, extensor digiti minimi, and extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) originate from the lateral epicondyle via the . The ECRB has additional origins from the radial collateral ligament, the ECU from the dorsal border of the ulna (shared with the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum profundus), and all four also originate from various fascia. Moving distally, there are the abductor pollicis longus (APL), extensor pollicis brevis (EPB), extensor pollicis longus (EPL), and extensor indicis (EI). The APL originates from the lateral part of the dorsal surface of the body of the ulna below the insertion of the anconeus and from the middle third of the dorsal surface of the body of the radius. The EPB arises from the radius distal to the APL and from the dorsal surface of the radius. The EPL arises from the dorsal surface of the ulna and the EI from the distal third of the dorsal part of the body of ulna. The APL, EPB, EPL, and EI all have an additional origin at the interosseus membrane. Course The ECRL and ECRB, (with the brachioradialis) form the lateral compartment. Their muscle fibers end at the upper third and the mid forearm respectively, continuing as flat tendons along the lateral border of the radius, beneath the APL and EPB. They then pass beneath the extensor retinaculum and dorsal carpal ligament, where they lie in a groove on the back of the radius, immediately behind the styloid process, and continue into the second tendon compartment. The ED divides into four tendons which, with the EI tendons, go through the fourth tendon compartment of the dorsal carpal ligament. On the back of the hand, the ED tendons diverge to follow the fingers and the EI tendon joins the ulnar side of one of the ED tendons along the back of the index finger. The EDM takes a similar course as the EI except it follows the ED tendon along the little finger. The ECU crosses from the lateral to the medial side of the forearm. The APL and EPB pass obliquely down and lateral, ending in tendons which run through a groove on the lateral side of the lower end of the radius. The EPL tendon passes through the third compartment and lies in a narrow, oblique groove on the back of the lower end of the radius. Extensor digitorum tendons The ED tendons are more complex in their course. Opposite the metacarpophalangeal joint each tendon is bound by fasciculi to the collateral ligaments and serves as the dorsal ligament of this joint; after having crossed the joint, it spreads out into a broad aponeurosis, which covers the dorsal surface of the first phalanx and is reinforced, in this situation, by the tendons of the Interossei and Lumbricalis. Opposite the first interphalangeal joints this aponeurosis divides into three slips; an intermediate and two collateral: the former is inserted into the base of the second phalanx; and the two collateral, which are continued onward along the sides of the second phalanx, unite by their contiguous margins, and are inserted into the dorsal surface of the last phalanx. As the tendons cross the interphalangeal joints, they furnish them with dorsal ligaments. The tendon to the index finger is accompanied by the EI, which lies on its ulnar side. On the back of the hand, the tendons to the middle, ring, and little fingers are connected by two obliquely placed bands, one from the third tendon passing downward and lateralward to the second tendon, and the other passing from the same tendon downward and medialward to the fourth. Occasionally the first tendon is connected to the second by a thin transverse band. Collectively, these are known as the sagittal bands; they serve to maintain the central alignment of the extensor tendons over the metacarpal head, thus increasing the available leverage. Injuries (such as by an external flexion force during active extension) may allow the tendon to dislocate into the intermetacarpal space; the extensor tendon then acts as a flexor and the finger may no longer be actively extended. This may be corrected surgically by using a slip of the extensor tendon to replace the damaged ligamentous band Anatomical snuff box The EPL tendon crosses obliquely the tendons of the ECRL and ECRB, and is separated from the EPB by a triangular interval, the anatomical snuff box, in which the radial artery is found. Insertion and action Insertions The ECRL inserts into the dorsal surface of the base of the second metacarpal bone on its radial side to extend and abduct the wrist.Platzer 2004, p 164 The ECRB inserts into the lateral dorsal surface of the base of the third metacarpal bone, with a few fibres inserting into the medial dorsal surface of the second metacarpal bone, also to extend and abduct the wrist. The ED inserts into the middle and distal phalanges to extend the fingers and wrist. Opposite the head of the second metacarpal bone, the EI joins the ulnar side of the ED tendon to extend the index finger. The EDM has a similar role for the little finger. The ECU inserts at the base of the 5th metacarpal to extend and adduct the wrist. The APL inserts into the radial side of the base of the first metacarpal bone to abduct the thumb at the carpometacarpal joint and may continue to abduct the wrist. The EPB inserts into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb to extend and abduct the thumb at the carpometacarpal and MCP joints. The EPL inserts on the base of the distal phalanx of the thumb. It uses the dorsal tubercle on the radius as fulcrum to help the EPB with its action as well as extending the distal phalanx of the thumb. Because the index finger and little finger have separate extensors, these fingers can be moved more independently than the other fingers. Neurovascular supply The ECU is supplied by the ulnar artery. The APL, EPB, EPL, EI, ED, and EDM are supplied by the Posterior interosseous artery, a branch of the ulnar artery. The ECRL and ECRB receive blood from the radial artery. The ECRL is supplied by the radial nerve and the ECRB by its deep branch. The remaining extrinsic hand extensors are supplied by the posterior interosseus nerve, another branch of the radial nerve.

The election took place in the middle of Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term, during the Great Depression. The Democrats built on the Congressional majorities they had won in the previous two elections. In the House of Representatives, Roosevelt's party gained nine seats, mostly from the Republican Party. The Democrats also gained nine seats in the U.S. Senate, thereby winning a supermajority. A Progressive also unseated a Republican in the Senate. This marked the first time since the Civil War that an incumbent president's party gained seats in a midterm election, followed by 1998 and 2002. The election was perhaps the most successful midterm of the 20th century for the party in control of the presidency. Despite opposition from Republicans, business organizations such as the US Chamber of Commerce, and disaffected Democrats who formed the American Liberty League, Roosevelt's New Deal policies were bolstered and his New Deal coalition was solidified. The election was critical in re-centering the Democratic Party in Northern, urban areas, as opposed to the party's traditional base in the South. Conservative Republicans also suffered major losses across the country. Future president Harry S. Truman won election as Senator from Missouri during this election.

Wilder House is an historic house at 1267 Main Street (Maine State Route 164) in Washburn, Maine. Built about 1852, it is a well-preserved example of mid-19th century vernacular architecture in northern Aroostook County, built in the first decade after widespread settlement began of the area. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. It is now owned by the local Salmon Brook Historical Society and operated as a historic house museum. Description and history The Wilder House is located in the center of the rural village of Washburn, set back from the east side of Main Street on the north side of the town common, which is bounded on its south by Wilder Street. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide and a single room deep, with a side gable roof, clapboard siding, and a foundation of granite and concrete blocks. Oriented to face south, the main facade has a single-story porch, supported by Tuscan columns, that extends across its full width and around to the west side. The main entrance, which is like the windows simply framed, stands in the rightmost bay. A single gabled dormer projects from the roof. A kitchen ell extends to the rear of the main block, with dormers on both sides of its gable roof, and a porch on the east side. The interior has well-preserved original plaster-and-lath walls, and an original staircase leading to the attic level. Widespread settlement of the interior of northern Aroostook County was delayed due to uncertainties surrounding the border with neighboring New Brunswick, which threatened war in the 1830s and were resolved by the 1842 Webster- Ashburton Treaty. Washburn was probably settled soon afterward, with Isaac Wilder one of its first settlers. His nephew Benjamin probably built this house around 1852, the year of his marriage. Wilder was a merchant and farmer in the community. The house was sold by his heirs in 1920 into the Jardine family, who sold it to the Salmon Brook Historical Society. The Society operates the house as a mid 19th-century period historic house museum, with the Aroostook Agricultural Museum, which is housed in a nearby barn.

The cab meets the EN 15227 standard (requirements for crashworthiness for railway vehicle bodies) and is therefore longer than that of the corresponding Class 423. The Class 430 is shorter than the class 422 because in the middle car, a single row of seats replaced a double row, allowing the car to be shorter. This was required because trains must fit alongside a platform; with three units coupled together, the Class 430 will have a length of . The trains have magnetic track brakes. The driver has two options for controlling the doors: first, the driver can unlock the doors on the platform side, and the passengers open the doors themselves with a pushbutton (as in the Class 423); second, the driver can unlock and open all of the doors on the platform side at once. The trains have more opening windows than the class 423, and larger information displays in the vestibules, similar to those on the Class 425. The information displays on the outside of the train are twice as big. The seats are in the standard DB colors, but with leather headrests. The seatbacks are ergonomically shaped and padded.

Description The neighboring villages are Jhabal Khurd, Thathi, Sarai Nurdin, Lalu Ghumman, Mannan, Panjwar and 15 km west of Amritsar Sahib. Jhabal Kalan is a very ancient village and is centuries old. It was one of the many earliest villages of Punjab. The village was founded by Dhillon Jatts. Jhabal Kalan is located in Amritsar district, Punjab. The place is known for being the birthplace of Maharaja Baghel Singh, Mai Bhago Ji, and Bhai Langah and many more. The village was once an important place of the Mughal empire, contributing the third portion of the overall 9 Lac revenue collected by its main divisional pargana - Patti, Punjab. The village was also the center Jagir gifted by Akbar to Bibi Bhani as a present on her wedding. The village is Jatt and the main religion is Sikhism. History The Jhabal Brothers Chaudhary Langah a Dhillon Jatt of Jhabal Kalan was a well known chieftain who had 84 villages under him in the Amritsar area during the late 16th Century. He was one of the three Chaudharys of Majha of Patti Parganah during the rule of Akbar, a liberal and secular Mughal ruler from 1556-1605. The family was a Hindu Jatt but Bhai Langaha's father took the name Abu Al Khair and converted to Islam. The family also started worshiping Sakhi Sarwar a Mystical Pir. Chaudhary Langah became so ill once that even his prayer to Sakhi Sarwar could not cure him from his pain. So, he met a Sikh who told him to pray to God Almighty and to House of Guru Nanak. Langah got better and converted to Sikhism, his Brother Bhai Pero Shah also became a Sikh. The whole family became a Sikh at that time. Guru Arjan Dev Ji (1563‚Äì1606) was the fifth Sikh Guru prophet. In 1588, both brothers went to Amritsar, then known as Guru Ka Chak, Holy Sikh City and also helped in the construction of the Harmandir Sahib. They preached Sikhism in their territories and soon Jhabal Kalan became a Sikh preaching center during the time of the Fifth Sikh prophet in the 1580s. Their descendants were Mai Bhag Kaur, the granddaughter of Chaudhary Pero Shah daughter of Bhai Mallo Shah and was a famous Sikh warrior during the time of Guru Gobind Singh Ji (1666‚Äì1708) Tenth Sikh Prophet. She led a group (Jatha) of 40 Sikhs from her Village and from neighboring villages to wage a war against the Muslim Empire of the Mughals in 1705. Jathedar Baba Baghel Singh was married into this family and made this village his home. He was a Sikh Warrior and a Misl Ruler who in 1783 invaded and raided Mughal Delhi. The House of the Jhabalia Sikh Brothers Langah, Pero Shah, still stands but is in ruins as it is about 500 years old, with old Nanakshahi Bricks. The famous Jhabal Brothers, Amar Singh Jhabalia, Sarmukh Singh Jhabalia and Jaswant Singh Jhabalia who sacrificed a lot for Gurduwara reforms and freedom struggle belonged to this village. Dr. Parkash Kaur, daughter-in-law off S. Amar Singh Jhabal became the first woman to be a Minister in erstwhile East Punjab after the partition of India and worked for the welfare of Punjab. S. Sarmukh Singh Jhabalia was the founder President of Sharomani Akali Dal. Famous events The land/villages around the village, jhabal, were gifted by Akbar to Bibi Bhani on her wedding. This place was the center of the Jagir. And when Baba Budha Sahib ji was asked to take care of the Jagir, they reside at a nearby place in the beed(jungle) and spent a major part of his life in the place. A Gurdwara has been built in his remembrance on the place. Some people migrated near the Gurdwara forming a village, now known as Thatta. The marriage of daughter of Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji (1595‚Äì1644) Sixth Sikh Guru, Bibi Viro (b.1615)was arranged in Jhabal Kalan and she was married to Bhai Sadhu son of Bhai Dharma of Village Malla. A Gurdwara stands known as Bibi Viro Anand Karaj Asthan where the marriage ceremony took place. She was the mother of five sons.  Location  The village is located on the intersection of Amritsar to Khemkaran Road and Amritsar to Atari Road near Patti, Punjab. By Road is about 22 km from Amritsar and 16 km from Tarn Taran Sahib. The village is quite near to the countries border shared with Pakistan.

Sinergia mixes a strong rock sound with an electronic bass, funk bass lines, and special sounds for each song. The band is known for mixing genres into unusual combinations. For example, Jefe contains elements of both ska and alternative metal. Their lyrics (sung in Chilean Spanish) focus on common elements of daily life and often take on a comedic or irreverent tone. Their songs have covered topics such as how to love a chubby woman, trying to win a contest, and personal relationships one has with a spouse or a boss. History Sinergia was formed in 1994, when they began composing their own songs inspired by groups like The Beatles, Faith No More, Primus, Mr. Bungle, etc. The following year they participated in the Escuelas de Rock (Rock Schools) project of the Asociaci√≥n de Trabajadores del Rock (Rock Workers Association), led by Claudio Narea (former member of Los Prisioneros), in which he would subsequently participate in 1997. In 1998 they recorded a demo called \\"Apoyando la Demencia\\" (Supporting Dementia), and \\"Chupatr√≥n\\" which talks about a disturbed man who seeks to be known. After a recess they consolidated with the current line-up, releasing their eponymous album, Sinergia, in 2001 with which they attempted to be recognized as an innovative band, as much for their lyrics as for their music with songs and respective videos such as \\"Mujer Robusta\\" (Chubby Woman), \\"Concurso\\" (Contest) or \\"Chile Robot\\", which even appeared on the MTV television channel. After the relative success in Chile with the album Sinergia, the band dedicated itself to mix more themes in 2004 with a view to what would be their album called \\"Proc√©salo Todo\\" (Process Everything), which includes the hit \\"Mi Se√±ora\\" (My Wife), which many couples identified with by the fact that the song talks about a woman who changes from a dedicated wife to a partying woman. In 2005 they released a tribute EP Canciones De Cuando √âramos Colegiales,(Songs When We Were Students) their versions of songs that influenced the adolescent stage of the band members, highlighting \\"S√≠ndrome Camboya\\" by the Chilean punk band Los Peores de Chile, \\"Somos Tontos no Pesados\\" of Los Tres and \\"Calibraciones\\" from the band Aparato Raro. The band's fifth album, Delirio (Delirium), was released in 2007. The track \\"Te Enojai' Por Todo\\" (You Get Mad About Everything) is dedicated to women, and talks about a couple where the woman is enraged by the countless activities of her husband. The music video for \\"Te Enojai' Por Todo\\" was voted the best video of the year in Chile. On August 10, 2007, they celebrated their thirteen-year career with a recital at the Teatro Teleton, where they also recorded their first DVD entitled \\"Imperdible\\". On February 21, 2008, the band participated in the XLIX International Song Festival of Vi√±a del Mar, the same day as Journey and the Chilean comedian Stefan Kramer. The band received three honors awarded by the public: The Silver Torch, The Golden Torch and The Silver Gull. On April 11, 2008, in the Altazor Awards, they received the \\"Best Rock Band of the Year\\" Award thanks to their album Delirio, beating out groups like Fiskales Ad-Hok and Matorral. Their sixth album called El Imperio De La Estupidez (Stupidity's Empire). It was released in September 2009, and contains 11 songs and four videos, including \\"H√°galo Bien\\". The bassist, Alexis \\"Aneres\\" Gonzalez announced he was leaving the group to follow academic work abroad. The role of new bassist was taken by his brother, Pedro Ariel \\"Arielarko\\" Gonzalez, who had replaced his brother on other occasions. \\"Vamos Con Todo\\" (released in November 2010) is an EP of 7 songs that deal with the New Wave of the 1960s. This album promoted two videoclips, \\"Mucho Amor\\", and \\"Modesto\\". A new disc was expected in 2011 On June 22, 2014 Sinergia, along with other Chilean bands, signed a contract with the record label, CHV M√∫sica, that belongs to Chilevisi√≥n, after the closing of their previous record label Oveja Negra. On July 1, 2014, the band confirmed on their Facebook page, all the 22 songs (and the back cover) that will be in their first compilation album that will come out later in the year.

Past members  Alexis \\"Aneres\\" Gonzalez Parra  Born on February 20, 1973. He was the original bassist of the band. His skills with the bass are one of the things that gave distinction to Sinergia over other bands in the Chilean public eye and he freely used the technique of slap to make riffs in the songs. Among his influences are The Beatles, Primus, Faith No More, Pantera, 311 and Level 42. He left the band because his work took him to the United States.  Luis Silva  Luis Silva was the original drummer of the band. Silva left the band in the early days because he was going to become a father. His departure forced the band into a hiatus until they found a new drummer.

On the day of the match Woodhead had been admonished by the England management for wearing non-regulation trousers. Woodhead was overlooked for the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup squad by manager Ted Copeland.

Professor Emeritus, Institute of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Medical Faculty of the University of Szeged, Hungary. He has held a number of notable positions and received a number of awards. His research contributed to the development of cardiac drugs.  Education  He graduated from high school in Gy≈ër and in 1949 he graduated at the Medical School of the University of P√©cs. He worked as intern in the Institute of Pharmacology at the same University. His original plan was to become a clinical physician, but after graduation he decided to stay in the Institute of Pharmacology. In 1959 and 1960 he did a few months postgraduate work in Moscow and Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) in the Pharmacological Institutes of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences. In 1960-61 he completed a Riker fellowship at the Department of Pharmacology of the University of Oxford. In 1963 he spent two months in the \\"Istituto Superiore di Sanit√°\\" in Rome to study methods concerning cerebral circulation with the Noble-prize laureate Professor Bovet. In 1982 he studied at the National Institute of Health and at the Food and Drug Administration in Washington, DC.  Work: Early period (1950‚Äì1960)  He researched cardiac metabolic changes due to hypoxia, ischaemia, hypothermia and cardiovascular drugs.  Work: Experimental cardiac arrhythmia (1960‚Äì1971) He became interested in experimental cardiac arrhythmia and antiarrhythmic drugs, area rather unexplored at that time. Worked with Dr. E. M. Vaughan Williams comparing the electrophysiological actions of different antiarrhythmic drugs. The result of their cooperation formed the basis of 'Vaughan Williams Classification' of antiarrhythmic drugs. Returning home he developed new models for the assessment of antiarrhythmic action, which were soon widely applied. He also studied the electrophysiologic changes due to drugs, ischemia or heart failure. The results and data on experimental cardiac arrhythmias and antiarrhythmic drugs were summarized with his co-authorship in the first comprehensive monograph written on this topic.  Work: Next decade (1970‚Äì1983) Search for methods to prevent sudden cardiac death due to acute myocardial infarction. First a new, (widely appreciated) model of experimental angina pectoris was developed. With the help of this method a number of antianginal and other cardiac drugs as well as their effect on hemodynamic and cardiac metabolic changes were studied. In addition it was for the first time shown that reorganization of the phospholipid structure of the myocardial membrane by linoleic acid-rich diet offers a marked protection against life-threatening arrhythmias due to coronary artery occlusion in rats. All these results and literature on epidemiology and pathophysiology of sudden cardiac death as well as on possible therapeutic measures were summarized in a monograph.  Work: Latest research period (1983‚Äì) He studied the effects of prostacyclin and its stable analogue: 7-oxo-prostacyclin in the experimental dog model of angina pectoris. A detailed analysis of the phenomenon of delayed anti-anginal action revealed that PgI2-pretreatment protected against consequences of ischaemia, such as early morphological changes, early and late postocclusion and reperfusion arrhythmias due to coronary artery occlusion or ouabain intoxication. This endogenous 'self-defense' due to delayed adaptation to stress is promising also as a future trend in therapy since it works in experimental atherosclerosis too. Exploratory investigations suggest that the phenomenon is not confined to the heart only, vessels and possibly other organs could be also involved. He was the founder of the \\"Szeged school of cardiovascular pharmacology\\" of international reputation, a number of his former pupils and co-workers became professors and leading scientists, and among them six became chairmen of Departments of Pharmacology in Hungary.  Major research interests and contributions  His major scientific interests and contributions included the first comprehensive analysis of the mode of action of antiarrhythmic drugs, the elucidation of the mechanism of cardiac arrhythmias, and that of the antiarrhythmic and anti-anginal drugs. He also developed several \\"in vivo\\" models of experimental arrhythmias as well as of that of angina pectoris for testing antiarrhythmic and anti-anginal drugs. Professor Szekeres also contributed to the discovery of drug induced delayed cardiac adaptation to stress. He was interested in the pathomechanism and pharmacological prevention of cardiac arrhythmias and the consequences of myocardial ischaemia.  Family  He married Lenke Rudas MD, former associate professor in the Department of Dentistry of the University of P√©cs and later of the University of Szeged (Died 1990). They had two daughters: Julia Barth√≥- Szekeres MD. PhD.

If both parents are identified as carriers, prenatal genetic testing can determine whether the fetus has inherited a defective copy of the gene from both parents. Couples may be willing to terminate the pregnancy, although abortion may raise ethical issues. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), which can be performed after the 10th week of gestation, is the most common form of prenatal diagnosis. Both CVS and amniocentesis present developmental risks to the fetus that have to be balanced with the possible benefits, especially in cases where the carrier status of only one parent is known. * Mate selection. In Orthodox Jewish circles, the organization Dor Yeshorim carries out an anonymous screening program so that couples who are likely to conceive a child with Tay‚ÄìSachs or another genetic disorder can avoid marriage. Nomi Stone of Dartmouth College describes this approach: \\"Orthodox Jewish high school students are given blood tests to determine if they have the Tay‚ÄìSachs gene. Instead of receiving direct results as to their carrier status, each person is given a six-digit identification number. Couples can call a hotline, and if both are carriers, they will be deemed 'incompatible.' Individuals are not told they are carriers directly in order to avoid the possibility of stigmatization or discrimination. If the information were released, carriers could potentially become unmarriageable within the community.\\" Anonymous testing eliminates the stigma of carriership while decreasing the rate of homozygosity in this population. Stone notes that this approach, while effective within a confined population such as Hasidic or Orthodox Jews, may not be effective in the general population. * Preimplantation genetic diagnosis. By retrieving the mother's eggs for in vitro fertilization and conceiving a child outside the womb, it is possible to test the embryo prior to implantation. Only healthy embryos are selected for transfer into the mother's womb. In addition to Tay‚ÄìSachs disease, PGD has been used to prevent cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Huntington's disease, and other genetic disorders. However this method is expensive. It requires invasive medical technologies, and is beyond the financial means of most couples.  Screening  Screening for TSD is carried out with two possible objectives: * Carrier testing seeks to detect whether an individual unaffected by the disease is carrying one copy of a mutation. Individuals seeking carrier screening are couples from at-risk populations who are seeking to start a family. Individuals and couples who seek carrier screening are aware of test results or genetic disease in ancestors or living family members. * Prenatal testing seeks to determine whether the fetus has inherited two defective copies, one from each parent. In prenatal testing, there is generally greater information about family history and the mutations are often known precisely. Prenatal testing for TSD is usually undertaken when both parents cannot be ruled out as possible carriers. Prenatal testing can be performed by assay of HEX A enzyme activity in fetal cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. If an actual mutation has been identified in both parents, then more precise mutational analysis techniques using PCR are available. Two technical approaches to testing for Tay‚ÄìSachs mutations are available. The enzyme assay approach tests phenotype at the molecular level with the levels of enzyme activity, while the mutation analysis approach tests the genotype directly, seeking known genetic markers. As with all biomedical tests, both approaches can produce false positives and false negative results. The two methods are used in tandem because an enzyme assay can detect all mutations with some inconclusive results, while mutation analysis can give definite results, but only for known mutations. Family history can be used to select a more effective testing protocol. Both carrier and prenatal testing using enzyme assay became available in the 1970s. Mutation analysis was added to testing protocols gradually after 1990 as the costs of PCR techniques declined. Over time, as knowledge of the mutation base has increased, mutation analysis has played an increasingly significant role. Due to the sensitive nature of testing in parental decisions, beginning in the 1970s wrongful life suits began to emerge. This was most common among parents who were not previously aware of their risk factors and felt that their doctors had the responsibility to inform them of their genetic risks.  Enzyme assay techniques  Enzyme assay techniques detect individuals with lower levels of hexosaminidase A. Development of a serum enzyme assay test made it feasible to conduct large scale screening for Tay‚ÄìSachs in targeted at-risk populations such as Ashkenazi Jews. Developed in the late 1960s and then automated during the 1970s, the serum test was a first in medical genetics. It produced few false positives among Ashkenazi Jews, the first group targeted for screening. In enzyme assay, success with one targeted population cannot always be generalized to other populations, because the mutation base is diverse. Different mutations have different effects on enzyme assay results. Polymorphisms are neutral, while others affect the phenotype without causing disease. Enzyme assay was particularly effective among Ashkenazi Jews because fewer pseudodeficiency alleles are found in this population, as compared with the general population. Because serum can be drawn at low cost and without an invasive procedure, it is the preferred tissue for enzyme assay testing. Whole blood is normally drawn, but the enzyme assay measures activity in leukocytes, white blood cells that represent only a small fraction of whole blood. Serum testing gives inconclusive results in about 10% of cases when used to screen individuals from the general population. Serum testing also cannot be used to test pregnant women or women using hormonal birth control pills. To address these deficiencies, other techniques using enzyme assay have been developed.  Mutation analysis techniques  Although early testing for human mutations was often conducted by extracting DNA from larger tissue samples, modern testing in human subjects generally employs polymerase chain reaction because small tissue samples can be obtained by minimally invasive techniques, and at very low cost. PCR techniques amplify a sample of DNA and then test genetic markers to identify actual mutations. Current PCR testing methods screen a panel of the most common mutations, although this leaves open a small probability of both false positive and false negative results. PCR testing is more effective when the ancestry of both parents is known, allowing for proper selection of genetic markers. Genetic counselors, working with couples that plan to conceive a child, assess risk factors based on ancestry to determine which testing methods are appropriate. Mutation analysis techniques have declined rapidly in cost since the 1980s, a development that has run parallel with advances in computation and information processing technology. At the same time, knowledge of mutations has increased, allowing researchers and practitioners to interpret mutation data. It will soon be cost efficient to sequence and analyze the whole HEXA gene in at-risk specimens. Biotechnology offers the prospect that in the future, all individuals, even those without known risk factors, will be able to afford a full genome sequence report (see personal genomics). Such screening would identify novel as well as known mutations. As the cost of direct mutation analysis declines, medical genetics will confront the fact that full sequencing of the genome identifies polymorphisms that are neutral or harmless. This prospect will create uncertainty for couples using full genome sequencing methods. Czech medical geneticist Eva Mach√°ckov√° writes: \\"In some cases it is difficult to distinguish if the detected sequence variant is a causal mutation or a neutral (polymorphic) variation without effect on phenotype. The interpretation of rare sequence variants of unknown significance detected in disease-causing genes becomes an increasingly important problem.\\"  In the Jewish population  Screening for Tay‚ÄìSachs carriers was one of the first great successes of the emerging field of genetic counseling and diagnosis. Proactive testing has been quite effective in eliminating Tay‚ÄìSachs occurrence among Ashkenazi Jews, both in Israel and in the diaspora. In 2000, Michael Kaback reported that in the United States and Canada, the incidence of TSD in the Jewish population had declined by more than 90% since the advent of genetic screening. On January 18, 2005, the Israeli English language daily Haaretz reported that as a \\"Jewish disease\\" Tay‚ÄìSachs had almost been eradicated. Of the 10 babies born with Tay‚ÄìSachs in North America in 2003, none had been born to Jewish families. In Israel, only one child was born with Tay‚ÄìSachs in 2003, and preliminary results from early 2005 indicated that none were born with the disease in 2004.  Public health model  Michael Kaback, at the time a medical resident in pediatric neurology at Johns Hopkins University, saw two Tay‚ÄìSachs families in 1969. At the time, researchers had only recently uncovered the biochemical basis of TSD as the failure of an enzyme in a critical metabolic pathway. Kaback developed and later automated an enzyme assay test (first reported in 1969 by O'Brien) for detecting heterozygotes (carriers). In the targeted population, this inexpensive test proved statistically reliable, with low rates of both errors and false positives. For the first time in medical history, it was possible to screen broadly for carriers of a genetic disease, and a physician or medical professional could counsel a family on strategies for prevention. Within decades, the disease had been virtually eliminated among Ashkenazi Jews. Most cases today are in families that do not have identifiable risk factors. Kaback and his associates also developed the first mass screening program for genetic disease carriers. Every aspect of this landmark study was meticulously planned, including community liaison, blood-draw procedure, laboratory set-up, assay protocol, and follow-up genetic counseling. On a Sunday in May 1971, more than 1,800 young adults of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry in the Baltimore and Washington, D.C., areas were voluntarily screened for carrier status. The success of the program demonstrated the efficacy of voluntary screening of an identifiable at-risk population. Within years, these screening programs had been repeated among Ashkenazi Jews throughout the United States, Canada, western Europe, and Israel.Kaback, M.M., Zeiger, R.S., Reynolds, L.W., and Sonneborn, M.

(1974) \\"Approaches to the control and prevention of Tay‚ÄìSachs disease,\\" in Progress in Medical Genetics, 10 (A. G. Steinberg and A. Bearn, editors) New York: Grune & Stratton, pp 103‚Äì134. Tay‚ÄìSachs disease has become a model for the prevention of all genetic diseases. In the United States before 1970, the disease affected about 50‚Äì70 infants each year in Ashkenazi Jewish families. About 10 cases occurred each year in infants from families without identifiable risk factors. Before 1970, the disease had never been diagnosed at the time of birth. Physicians saw the disease for the first time in infants that failed to thrive, and they could do nothing for the parents or family. Although the genetic basis of the disease was understood, antenatal testing was not available, and families with a Tay‚ÄìSachs infant faced a one in four probability of another devastating outcome with each future pregnancy. In the first 30 years of testing, from 1969 through 1998, more than 1.3 million persons were tested, and 48,864 carriers were identified. In at-risk families, among couples where both husband and wife were carriers, more than 3000 pregnancies were monitored by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Out of 604 monitored pregnancies where there was a prenatal diagnosis of Tay‚ÄìSachs disease, 583 pregnancies were terminated. Of the 21 pregnancies that were not terminated, 20 of the infants went on to develop classic infantile Tay‚ÄìSachs disease, and the 21st case progressed later to adult-onset Tay‚ÄìSachs disease. In more than 2500 pregnancies, at-risk families were assured that their children would not be affected by Tay‚ÄìSachs disease.

Rajamanthri Walauwa is an eight-room, 200-year-old mansion built by the last Chief Minister of the Kingdom of Kandy in 1804. It was fully restored in 1944. In 1970, Prince Gamini Rajamanthri and in 1972, Prince Samantha Rajamanthri, Julius Rajamanthri's two sons became the new inhabitants of the Rajamanthri Walauwa. To this day, the manor house is managed by Prince Julius' sons. History This villa was built in 1804 by the Chief Minister to the last King of Kandy. The kingdom at that time forbade the use of roofing tile to anyone who wasn't royalty. Despite this ban, Chief Minister Rajamanthri built a replica palace with two sprawling stories of terracotta tiles for himself. Two hundred years later, Geoffrey Bawa's prot√©g√©, Chief Minister Julius Rajamanthri from Govi Gama Radala caste, began a delicate restoration work that retained the essence of the villa. The estate is a major producer of coconuts, rubber, pepper, cardamom, ginger, cocoa, areca nut, coffee, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, vanilla, orchids and teak. Meaning of walauwa In Sinhala, walauwa means mansion. The English terms for walauwa are \\"manor\\" or \\"manor house\\", a large house with larger lands. The walauwa and its owners were supported by the larger lands and estates they possessed. These either were land grants from kings since the beginning of the Sinhalese kingdom until the Kandyan era or government service during the Colonial era, or were acquired by a successful enterprise and passed down through generations. The owners were the landed elites of Ceylon; as such they gained a status of power and wealth. There is another theory that walauwa means a place of judgement. Those people who occupied the walauwa had the authority to pass judgement over people with the authority provided by Royal Decree. Mansions replaced the walauwa in the urban areas towards the latter part of the nineteenth century.

The officers saw a motorcyclist, whom they approached, and he provided them with his details, which later proved to be false. A short time later they saw the man again, acting suspiciously, and the two officers approached him. Bowden noticed that the man had a large knife in his belt and was holding his right hand inside his jacket. Bowden attempted to seize the knife but the man pulled back and drew out a 9 mm pistol. The man fired almost immediately at Bowden, but he escaped injury as the bullet was fired across his body and was deflected by the thick leather cover of his notebook in a breast pocket.
