He was the first of a long series of Latin American poets who extolled the special beauties of the New World.  Life  Born in Valdepeñas, Spain around 1561, Balbuena came to the New World as a young adult and lived in Guadalajara, Jalisco and Mexico City, where he studied theology. In 1606 he returned to Spain and earned the degree of Doctor of Theology, and rose within the Church to become Abbot in Jamaica (1610) and one of the early Bishops of Puerto Rico (1620). (in Latin) Despite his priestly duties, he found time to write long and elegant verses which are excellent examples of the Baroque tendency to heavily load (and sometimes overload) poetry with highly detailed descriptions. Unfortunately, many of his manuscripts and his library were burned by Dutch pirates during a 1625 attack on Puerto Rico. He died two years later.  His work  Perhaps his best work is Grandeza mexicana (Mexico's Grandeur, published in 1604), in which he replies in elegant and lyrical verse to a nun who asked him for a description of the young Spanish city of Mexico. Balbuena takes advantage of this opportunity to present a detailed inventory of the complicated, luxurious and beautiful city as he knew it almost 100 years after the arrival of Hernán Cortés. The details he provides include physical geography, the climate, the surroundings, the architecture, the vegetation, the different human types, the animals, all in great detail. The poem is high-sounding, but at the same time simple; it is direct, but also contains complicated metaphors, word plays, majestic adjectives, and a rich catalog of the lexicon. Balbuena's works represent some of the best of the Baroque's love of color, detail, ornamentation and intellectual playfulness. It also stands as a monument to the pride in the New World that many transplanted Spaniards shared with the \\"criollo\\" (the Americans descended from Spanish or Portuguese families). A critical edition of Grandeza mexicana, prepared with introduction, notes and bibliography by Asima Saad Maura appeared in 2011 (Madrid: Cátedra); it takes into consideration the two different editions published during Balbuena's life, each one dedicated to a different person. Saad Maura's edition also includes Balbuena's treaty on poetry. In 2007, well-known Spanish translator, Margaret Sayers Peden collected Mexican literature including that of Bernardo de Balbuena's in order to combine and edit the book Mexican Writers on Writing (Trinity University Press).

It is a park stretching approximately along the floor of the valley of the River Sheaf, sandwiched between Abbeydale Road South (A621) and the railway tracks of the Midland Main Line.  History  Early history Before the park was created, the area had been used for farmland and small industrial sites, which had been built to take advantage of the power provided by the river. The Ecclesall corn mill—remnants of which can be seen at the north of the park—is recorded as early as 1299, when it was given by Robert de Ecclesall to the monks of Beauchief Abbey. The Skargell or Bartin wheel was located on the site of the present-day boating lake. It was a cutlers wheel that was constructed in the first half of seventeenth century and remained in use into the mid-nineteenth century. In the late eighteenth century land at Millhouses, known as the Grange Ville Estate, was purchased by Peter Wigfall. He died in 1828 and the land passed to Thomas Whitehead under the terms of a will dated 1812. In 1837 William Speck filed a court case claiming that the will of 1812 was a forgery, and that he, as the closest living relative of Peter Wigfall should inherit the land. This case was dismissed, but in 1855 Joseph Oldale also claimed ownership of the land and took forcible possession of property at Millhouses, a siege ensued and eventually Oldale was removed. Legal proceedings followed, and in 1858 Oldale was charged with having fraudulently altered the parish records to bolster his claims. Whitehead sold the property to William Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 6th Earl Fitzwilliam, but in 1875 Oldale's son William reasserted the family's claim to the land and forcibly took possession of property in Millhouses, including farmland that was leased by the miller of the corn mill and the inn keeper at the Waggon and Horses Inn (the future site of Millhouses Park). Once again the claim was unsuccessful and the land returned to Earl Fitzwilliam. The park In 1907 William Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 7th Earl Fitzwilliam gave some of his land in Millhouses to the City of Sheffield. The City Council bought more land and laid out a public park. By the 1930s facilities at the park included a boating lake, an open-air swimming pool, paddling pools, a cricket pitch, bowling greens, and tennis courts. By the 1960s the park could attract up to 50,000 visitors on summer weekends. In the 1980s, the lido (the successor of the open-air swimming pool) was closed, and in the 1990s the paddling pools were also closed due to fears of water pollution in the River Sheaf, which fed the pools. In 2010, Splash Waterplay was opened, completing the renovation of the old Lido area. This now incorporates a traditional and adventure play area, skate park and Splash area. The old paddling pools were also filled and landscaped to form a 'fish ladder' which allows migratory fish to swim up-stream to spawn. It also creates several rock-pools and planting areas for wildlife to thrive. Later in 2010, the old park-keeper's hut was taken over by the Park Cafe to provide refreshments to the play area. This also saw the banning of dogs in this area, with the installation of gates and fencing to surround the playgrounds. A sensory garden was established which has now matured to provide an oasis of calm within the park. In 2011, Cliffhanger was once again held in the park and a new Outdoor Gym was opened next to the skatepark, along with a zipwire in the playground area. The park was also granted the Green Flag award for its excellent facilities, environmental sustainability and horticultural standards. Plans for 2012 saw the installation of a children's cycle roadway, the old poplar trees were removed and replaced by an avenue of mature oak trees and improvements to the old Mill Buildings at the Northern end of the park during 2012 & 2013 saw the smaller mill building brought back to a usable state. In 2014, Cliffhanger once again returned to Millhouses Park, following a short absence in Graves Park. Flooding As the park is situated on the valley floor alongside the River Sheaf it is occasionally flooded. On 1 July 1958 a severe flood damaged many of the facilities in the park and washed away a foot bridge across the river. It is now hoped that this bridge will be replaced in the near future, opening up an area of the park made inaccessible in 1958. On 25 June 2007, Ryan Joe Parry, a 14-year-old boy, was swept to his death in the park by the flooded river. Activities in the park The park contains open grassed areas, woodlands, and floral displays. Facilities on offer include: * Football pitches * All-weather 5-a-side pitch * Crown Bowling greens * Cricket pitch - home to Millhouses Works Cricket Club * Boating lake for paddle boats and model/radio controlled boating * Basketball court * Children's play area * Climbing Frame * Skate park * Adventure playground * Zip Wire * Splash Water Play * Tennis courts * 9-hole putting course * Outdoor Gymnasium * Heart Walk (signposted) * Café serving gourmet food, drinks and ice creams * Car Parking (Pay & Display) The Millhouses Park Duck Race takes place each year, usually in conjunction with the Cliffhanger festival.

William Barlow was educated with his younger brother Edward at the English College in Douai. (His brother became Ambrose Barlow and is venerated as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales.) Wishing to become a Benedictine, Barlow joined the Spanish congregation in 1604 at which time he was given the religious name by which he is now known, being professed at Cella Nueva in Galicia in 1605. Ordained a Catholic priest in 1608 he graduated with the degree of Doctor of Divinity at Salamanca. In 1611 he transferred to join the community of English monks at the Priory of St Gregory the Great in Douai (now Downside Abbey in England), where he was made its prior in 1614. Two years later he was also appointed a professor of theology at St. Vaast College of the University of Douai, a house of studies for the monks of the Abbey of St. Vaast, motherhouse of Douai Priory. He held this office for forty years. From 1621 to 1629 Barlow served as the President General of the English Benedictine Congregation. In 1633 he became titular Cathedral-Prior of Canterbury. Beyond a circular letter to the English Benedictines about their relations with the Vicar Apostolic of England, none of his writings survive. According to Dom Ralph Weldon, Barlow was looked on as a leading theologian and canonist; and effectively opposed Richard Smith, who claimed leadership of the English Roman Catholics, in becoming Bishop of Chalcedon. On the death of William Bishop, the first Vicar Apostolic of England, Barlow was consulted by the pope as to the best successor, and recommended Smith; but later he differed on the question of the extent of the vicar's jurisdiction.

Life He was born at Celleno and became the a pupil of a baptized Jew, Giovanni Battista, who instructed him in Hebrew. On completing his studies, Bartolocci entered the Cistercian order. It was from Battista that Bartolocci obtained his knowledge of Hebrew and rabbinical literature. He was appointed, in 1651, professor of Hebrew and Rabbinics at the Collegium Neophytorum at Rome, and \\"Scriptor Hebraicus\\" at the Vatican Library. It was in the Vatican, and with the assistance of Battista, that Bartolocci received his preparation for the work that was to give him lasting fame in the world of Jewish bibliography; and it was at the Vatican and its subsidiary libraries that he obtained his chief materials. In 1675 he began in Rome the publication of Bibliotheca Magna Rabbinica, a bibliography, in Latin and Hebrew, of Hebrew literature, arranged according to the names of the authors. This work appeared in four folio volumes, 1675–1693, three of which were published by the author and the fourth by Carlo Giuseppe Imbonati, his disciple. Imbonati's supplement contained a list of authors arranged according to the subjects on which they wrote. The latter added to this work a fifth volume, the Bibliotheca Latina Hebraica, Rome, 1694, which contained the works and the names of Christian authors who had written in Latin on Jews and Judaism. It was from Battista that Bartolocci obtained the idea and plan of the Bibliotheca Magna Rabbinica, as well as part of the material. Battista began the composition of the book in a chronological order, which order was abandoned by Bartolocci. Richard Simon, in writing in his Bibliothèque Critique about Bartolocci's work, says: :\\"It contains much of Jewish learning, but little of judgment, and is conspicuous for a profound ignorance in the most common matters that concern criticism.\\" Complaints were also made that he devoted space to refutations of Jewish arguments and that his translations from the Talmud were faulty. On the other hand, Johann Christoph Wolf attributes to Bartolocci the motive and stimulus for his own later work. Even with its faults, the Bibliotheca Rabbinica was a great undertaking. It was the first attempt on a large scale to give to the world an account of the literature of the Jews. It is not a mere bibliographic and biographic compilation, but contains also a number of dissertations on Jewish customs, observances, and religious ideas; on the River Sambation, on the beginnings of Hebrew typography, and the like. Some Hebrew treatises are reprinted in full; for example, \\"Alphabet of Ben Sira,\\" \\"Megillat Antiochus,\\" \\"Otiot de-R. Aḳiba,\\" and a part of Eldad ha-Dani's mythical journey. Several attempts were made to render Bartolocci's work more accessible. The first who thought of publishing Bartolocci's work, with the omission of its Hebrew texts, etc., was the Oxford scholar Edward Bernard. Adriaan Reland of Holland attempted to publish in Amsterdam such an extract of the Bibliotheca, but he failed to execute the plan, there appearing in print the biographies alone of such famous exegetes as Rashi, Abraham ibn Ezra, David Ḳimḥi, Levi ben Gershom, and Judah Abravanel, which were embodied in his Analecta Rabbinica (Utrecht, 1702). Bartolocci left in manuscript a work on the difficult expressions in the Mishnah. References *Wolf, Bibl.

Life He was born at Sulisławice, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, Sandomierz County, Kingdom of Poland, the son of Józef, an organist, and Maryja (Sroczynska) Barzyński. In baptism he received the name Michał (Michael), but during an illness he was placed under the protection of St. Vincent Ferrer and henceforth called Wincenty (Vincent). Because of frail health he was educated privately. In 1856 he entered the diocesan seminary at Lublin and was ordained priest, 28 October 1861. After six months illness spent at the home of his father, he was appointed vicar at Horodło, member of the chapter of the collegiate church of the Zamojscy, and later transferred to Tomaszew, which was the scene of great military activity during the Polish uprising of 1863. As organizer, appointed by the secret Polish national Government, he provided the insurrectionists with military supplies. Compelled soon after to flee to Kraków, he found refuge with the Franciscan fathers in that city. After fifteen months of wandering he received his passport enabling him to leave for Paris in 1865. Here he fell under the influence of Peter Semenenko, Hieronim Kajsewicz, Aleksander Jelowicki, and Adam Mickiewicz, who dreamed of Poland's resurrection through the spiritual regeneration of the Poles. Going to Rome, he joined the newly founded Congregation of the Resurrection and soon after receiving the special blessing of Pope Pius IX set out for America (1866). After several years' labour in the Diocese of San Antonio, Texas, he was appointed pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, Chicago, in 1874, then comprising about 450 families. Father Barzyński became a dominant influence during the period of Polish immigration. He gave the American Poles a class consciousness, and took a combative line against the Polish National Alliance. He assisted in the organization of nearly every Polish parish in Chicago established before his death. He built St. Stanislaus Kostka Church and its school (since destroyed by fire and rebuilt), and gave the Poles an orphanage; founded St. Stanislaus Kostka College (which later became Archbishop Weber High School); introduced the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth into the United States; formed a corps of Polish teachers in his own school; and interested the School Sisters of Notre Dame in Polish immigration. He founded the first American Polish Catholic paper, the Gazeta Katolicka, his personal medium for many years, and established the first Polish daily Catholic paper in America, the Dziennik Chicagoski, against the in liberal press, particularly Zgoda, the publication of the Polish National Alliance. He founded the Polish Roman Catholic Union. He died in Chicago on May 2, 1899. By this time, St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish had grown to 40,000 members, and nearby Holy Trinity Parish had 25,000 members. His funeral was one of the largest Chicago had ever seen: 10,000 marchers, 500 funeral carriages, and 150 clergymen, not counting spectators.

Biography Baudeau became a monk at Chancelade Abbey, where he taught theology. In 1765 he founded the first economics periodical to be published in France, Éphémérides du citoyen, and was at first an opponent of the physiocrats. In 1766, however, he became a proponent of physiocracy. He died in Paris in 1792. The French word \\"économiste\\" first appeared in print in a book by Baudeau. Early usage of the concept of an \\"entrepreneur\\" can also be attributed to Baudeau. One of Baudeau's influential works, Idées d'un citoyen sur l'administration des finances du Roi, was critical of the commission established in 1764 by Clément Charles François de Laverdy for the purpose of drafting new laws on vagabonds, beggars, and the central distribution of alms. Baudeau argued that the governmental provision of alms to the poor was a more important goal than the passing of laws prohibiting poverty. In 1768, Baudeau was recruited by Ignacy Jakub Massalski, the Bishop of Vilnius, in order to bring physiocratic ideas to Poland. The main focus of his work there had to do with facilitating exports of Polish grain to France. Baudeau died in 1792 in Paris.

Biography After attending the Gymnasium in St. Gall he studied law at Fribourg, Switzerland, and in Vienna. From 1817 to 1819 he was a tutor in Hungary. Returning to Vienna in 1819, he was arrested there after the murder of August von Kotzebue by Karl Ludwig Sand on the false suspicion of belonging to a Swiss political society and was expelled form the city in 1820. He began his political career as keeper of the archives of his native canton, St. Gall. This position gave him the opportunity of learning the topography, history, laws, and legal relations of the canton. In 1822 he was made official secretary; in 1825 he became a member of the great council of the canton and was appointed chancellor. On account of his knowledge of business he was selected, in 1831, for the position of Landammann, or chief magistrate of the canton, and held the office until 1846. During his administration he tried to make a closely united republic out of the loosely connected cantons, and to improving the Swiss roads and waterways. Appointed a delegate, at this time, to the diet at Lucerne he endeavoured at the diet to bring about a reorganization of the confederation. He wished to create a vigorous, organically united republic similar to that of the United States, retaining at the same time a large amount of independence for the individual cantons. Baumgartner's chief opponents in carrying out this project were the Catholic clergy, for he aimed to separate the Church entirely from Rome and to place it under the control of the State. He was largely influenced by Josephinism and by the ideas of Ignaz Heinrich von Wessenberg. In 1832, at his suggestion, the Bishopric of Chur was dissolved. In 1834, at the so-called Assembly of Baden, he gave expression to his views in the motions he introduced. These were, that ecclesiastical administration of law be placed under the control of the State, that he should have direction of the education of the clergy, that the ecclesiastical right of patronage should be limited and that the privileges of the religious orders should be revoked. After 1841, when his political friends dissolved the monastic houses of Aargau by force, he changed his opinions and came over to the side of his former opponents. On this account he had to retire from his position as Landammann. In 1845 he again entered the diet as representative of the Catholic Peoples' party, but after two years was forced out by the victory of the Liberals. He now propounded the views of the Catholic Church in the press and in popular assemblies. He was once more a member of the Swiss federal assembly, 1857–60, and became again Landammann but was overthrown in 1864. After his defeat in 1864, Baumgartner withdrew altogether from public life and devoted himself to the study of the history of his native canton. The results of his researches appeared in two works issued by him: Die Schweiz in ihren Kämpfen und Umgestaltungen von 1830-1850 (4 vols, Zurich, 1853, 1866), and Geschichte des schweizerischen Freistaats und Kantons St. Gallen (2 vols., Zurich, 1868). A third volume of the history was prepared by his son, Alexander, from the papers Baumgartner left at his death, and issued in Einsiedeln in 1890. His son, Alexander Baumgartner, a poet and historian of literature, published an extensive biography of him under the title: Gallus Jakob Baumgartner und die neuere Staatssentwicklung der Schweiz (Freiburg, Baden, 1892).

Biography  This great educator, was born at Bellegarde-en-Gâtinais (Loiret), France, the 24 of August 1828, and died in the departement of Nord, in Gruson the 9 of November 1919. He was one of the clergy of Orléans, until 1877, after which he was attached to the Catholic University of Lille, first as professor, and later as rector. No Catholic university profited more by the Law of 1875 that granted freedom of higher education. Monsignor Baunard received the degree of Doctor of Letters, in 1860. In the two theses which he wrote he treated of the pedagogy of Plato and of Theodulphus, Bishop of Orléans in the time of Charlemagne; both works which marked the beginning of a literary activity surpassed by few. As hagiographer he wrote on St. John the Apostle (1869) and St. Ambrose (1871). He wrote the biographies of Saint Louise de Marillac, the foundress of the Daughters of Charity (1898); of (Madame) Saint Madeleine Sophie Barat (1876), foundress of the Ladies of the Sacred Heart; of Vicomte Armand de Melun (1880), Cardinal Pie, Bishop of Poitiers (1886), Cardinal Lavigerie (1896), Ernest Lelièvre, co-founder of the Little Sisters of the Poor (1905), and Philibert Vrau, the great Christian manufacturer (1906). The French religious history of the nineteenth century was summarized by him in \\"un siècle de l'Eglise de France\\" (1901). He contributed notable works of religious psychology in his celebrated books, \\"Le doute et ses victimes\\" (1865), and \\"La foi et ses victoires\\" (1881-83). His \\"Espérance\\" (1892) throws much light on the beginnings of the contemporary religious revival among intelligent Frenchmen at the end of the nineteenth century; his \\"L'évangile du pauvre\\" (1905) appeared opportunely during a period of social unrest.

Both houses continued despite frequent harassment by local authorities for their ties to the Catholic Church, being suspected of harboring Catholic priests. Bedingfeld supervised both communities until 1686, when she settled in York. Bedingfeld's family connections often helped her to avoid major punishment, even though the community endured repeated searches and destruction of their house. Bedingfeld was arrested three times: London (1674), York (1679), and in 1694, she and her great-niece, Mother Dorothy Pastor Bedingfeld, were summoned before a magistrate and briefly committed to the gaol at Ouse Bridge in York.Publications of the Catholic Record Society, Volume 4, Catholic Records society, 1907 The community was attacked in 1695, at which time the house was almost destroyed.

Life and work Kavanagh was born in 1940 in Durban, South Africa, where her father was a journalist before and after his service as a fighter pilot in the SAAF during the Second World War. Her mother, Olive (née Le Roux), was a pioneering public health inspector. Her half-sister, Julie Kavanagh, is a ballet critic. Her half-brother, Michael O'Brien, is a geologist living in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. She attended the University of Cape Town, but pursued an interest in acting. She had an uncredited, non-speaking role in Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood after coming to Britain in 1964. She did not get paid for the part, but, as she later recalled, she did \\"get to snog Richard Burton\\". It marked the end of her acting career. While working for J. Walter Thompson as a copywriter, she answered an advertisement for a position as a literary agent. She was hired by \\"A. D. Peters, a legendary agent who showed her the ropes\\", taught her how to negotiate and gave her responsibility for selling serialization and newspaper rights for the agency's early group of clients, including Arthur Koestler, S. J. Perelman, Rebecca West and Tom Wolfe. She was married to, and was the literary agent of, the writer Julian Barnes. They lived in North London. In the 1980s, Kavanagh left Barnes for a relationship with author Jeanette Winterson, author of Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, but later returned to the marriage. Winterson is said to have used the relationship as the basis of her novel The Passion (1987). Kavanagh became the agent in 1985 of Martin Amis, who left her after 23 years to \\"throw in his lot\\" with American agent Andrew Wylie, as part of an effort to get a large advance for his own novel The Information. In 2001, her employer, now known as Peters, Fraser & Dunlop, was purchased by CSS Stellar, a company specializing in sports marketing. Kavanagh was one of several former employees who left the company in September 2007 to form United Agents. Her clients left to join her at the new firm.

Returning to Mexico (1811) he was made Archdeacon of the Metropolitan church of Mexico (1813), and was afterwards its Dean. Beristain was a secular priest who had made thorough studies in Mexico and perfected them in Spain under the favourable circumstances.

His magnum opus is the Biblioteca hispano-americana septentrional, the last part of which was published after his death. For this he used as a basis the Biblioteca mexicana of Bishop Juan José de Eguiara y Eguren of which only the first volume (as far as \\"J\\") appeared in print. Beristáin at first intended to republish Eguiara, completing the alphabet by means of sketches and notes left by the author, but, as he proceeded to carry out the idea, he found that it would be preferable to compose an independent bibliography, incorporating in it the material Eguiara had collected. of Beristain's Biblioteca contains many errors in names and dates.

Gaza kidnapping On August 14, 2006, he was kidnapped by Palestinian gunmen while on assignment in Gaza City, along with Olaf Wiig, a cameraman from New Zealand. A witness saw two vehicles blocking the journalist's transmission truck and a masked man put a gun to their bodyguard's head, forcing him to the ground.

Life thumb After being for some time assistant pastor in his native city, he took part, in 1822, in the foundation of the Association Royale de Saint-Joseph, and later of the Oeuvre de Saint-Henri. These two institutions were destined to give to workingmen free instruction and professional training. To reach this end more effectively, he founded, in 1827, a boarding-school where, besides manual training, poor boys could receive intellectual, religious, and moral education. This is the Oeuvre de Saint-Nicolas. In the beginning only seven children were in the establishment, but it soon developed and was transferred from its poor quarters in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau, to a better location in the Rue Vaugirard. At the time of the Revolution of 1830, the first two institutions disappeared, but the Institution Saint-Nicolas remained. It had many difficulties to overcome; the resources were insufficient; proper instructors could not always be found; suspicions of political intrigues were entertained by the Government, which led to various vexatious inquiries. De Bervanger succeeded in overcoming all obstacles, and the institution became more and more prosperous. Soon a branch establishment was founded at Issy. In 1859 De Bervanger turned over the institution to Cardinal Morlot, Archbishop of Paris, who gave the direction of it to the Christian Brothers. It has since been enlarged. De Bervanger wrote the Règle de l'oeuvre de Saint Nicolas (1853).

Henry Digby Beste (1768–1836) was an English writer and aristocratic convert to Catholicism, seen as a precursor to the Oxford Movement. Life He was born at Lincoln, England, 21 October 1768, the son of the Rev. Henry Beste, D. D., prebendary of Lincoln Cathedral. His mother, Magdalen, daughter and heiress of Kenelm Digby, Esq., of North Luffenham in Rutland, claimed to be the representative of the extinct male line of the historic Sir Everard and Sir Kenelm Digby. His father dying in 1782, Henry was sent two years later by his mother to Oxford. He became a commoner of Magdalen College, where he took his B. A. degree in 1788 and his M. A. in 1781. He was afterward elected to a fellowship, which he resigned when the family estates came to him on the death of his mother. In September, 1791, he took deacon's orders in the Anglican church, and a little later retired to Lincoln, where he was active as a preacher. Doubts about the spiritual authority of the Established Church sprang up in his mind, which were strengthened by intercourse with the Abbé Beaumont, then in charge of the small Catholic chapel at Lincoln. The result was that he was received into the Catholic Church by Rev. Mr. Hodgson, Vicar-General of the London district, 26 May 1798. He died at Brighton, 28 May 1836. In 1800, he had married Sarah, daughter of Edward Sealy, Esq., and was the father of the author John Richard Digby Beste (e. g. Modern Society in Rome. A novel, 1856).XIX Century Fiction Part I: A–K. Jarndice: Bloomsbury, 2019. Works His first works were a treatise entitled \\"The Christian Religion briefly defended against the Philosophers and Republicans of France (octavo, 1793), and in the same year a discourse on \\"Priestly Absolution\\" which was republished in 1874. This latter work anticipated some of the Tractarian arguments and met with the commendation of members of the University of Oxford in 1794. After his conversion Beste was an occasional contributor to Catholic periodicals. He also travelled abroad and spent several years in France and Italy. Cardinal Wiseman met him at Rome in the Jubilee of 1825, and mentions him in his \\"Last Four Popes\\" (Boston, 1858), p. 245).

His third feature film after Alice and Faust, it was nominated for the Golden Leopard at the Locarno International Film Festival. Plot In Prague, Mr. Pivoňka, an unmarried man, buys some pornography from his local newsagent, Mr. Kula, and returns home. A postwoman, Mrs. Malková gives him a letter which reads \\"On Sunday\\" in cut-out letters. In secret, she then rolls pieces of bread into little balls and carries them in her satchel. Pivoňka asks his neighbour, Mrs. Loubalová, to slaughter a chicken for him. Using the leftover feathers and papier-mâché made from the pornography, he constructs a chicken head and fabricates wings made from umbrellas. Meanwhile, police captain Weltinský buys rolling pins and pan lids from the same shop that sells Pivoňka's umbrellas. Using these items, plus stolen pieces of fur and sharp things, Weltinský constructs unusual objects in his workshop. His wife, a newsreader named Anna Weltinská (who portrays herself), feels neglected and buys some live carp. She is unaware that Kula is in love with her image and has constructed a machine rigged to stroke and masturbate him when she is on television. Pivoňka and Loubalová construct life-size effigies of each other. On Sunday, Pivoňka drives to the country with his effigy while Loubalová takes her effigy to an abandoned crypt containing a closet, a chair with candles and a basin of water. Loubalová emerges from the closet and whips her straw effigy which, being animated, reacts. Pivoňka dresses in his chicken outfit and struts around his similarly animated effigy, eventually crushing it with a boulder while Loubalová drowns hers in the basin. At home, Malková shoves an unfeasible number of bread balls in her nose and ears and takes a nap. While Weltinská strokes her carp and feeds them the bread balls Malková later delivers, Beltinský strips naked in his workshop and rubs his objects over his body. When Weltinská reads the news, Kula turns on his machine and climaxes at the same time that she does, stimulated by the carp sucking her toes under her desk. On his way home, Pivoňka is fascinated by Weltinská's image in a television shop window and stops to buy electronic equipment magazines at Kula's shop. Kula is now covering rolling pins with feathers; Malková looks longingly at a carp in a fishmonger's windows. Pivonka discovers that Loubalová has been killed in her flat by a boulder that has seemingly dropped through her roof; Beltinský is investigating.

He was born in Dunfermline, Scotland and died in Poitiers, France. Career Adam was orphaned at a young age and his education was sponsored by his great uncle, Robert Reid, Bishop of Orkney.Adam Blackwood, DNB, vol.5 Blackwood went to the University of Paris and then on to Toulouse to study civil law, with the direct patronage of Mary, Queen of ScotsCatholic Encyclopedia article then in the French Court.Adam Blackwood, DNB, vol.5 In 1567-8 he was a rector of the University of Paris. Blackwood became a practicing lawyer in the Parlement at Poitiers, an appointment in the gift of Mary, awarded in 1579 after the publication of his first polemic, the De Conjunctione Religionis et Imperii. According to his Histoire (1589), Blackwood visited Mary in England.Burn, J.H., 'Buchanan and the anti- monarchomachs', in Mason, Roger A., ed., Scots and Britons, CUP / Folger (1994), pp. 146–152. Published works Blackwood's major work was a critique of George Buchanan's dialogue De Iure Regni apud Scotos, (1579), in which Buchanan had intended to justify to the forced abdication of Mary, Queen of Scots. * De Conjunctione religionis et imperii libro duo, Paris (1575), (Two books on the union of Religion and temporal power) * The Apology for Kings; ** Adversus Georgii Buchanani dialogum, de iure regni apud Scotos pro regibus apologia, Poitiers (1581) & Paris (1588) * Histoire de la martyre de la royne de royne d'Escosse, Paris (1589) From DNB After following the study of mathematics, philosophy, and oriental languages, he passed two years at Toulouse, reading civil law. On his return to Paris he begun to employ himself in teaching philosophy. In 1574 he published at Paris a eulogistic memorial poem on Charles IX of France, entitled Caroli IX Pompa Funebris versiculis expressa per A. B. J.C (Juris Consultum), and in 1575, also at Paris, a work on the relation between religion and government, entitled De Vinculo; seu Conjunctione Religionis et Imperii libri duo, quibus conjurationum traducuntur insidiæ nico religionis adumbratæ. A third book appeared in 1612. The work was dedicated to Queen Mary of Scotland, and, in keeping with his poem commemorating the author of the massacre of St. Bartholomew, was intended to demonstrate the necessity laid upon rulers to extirpate heresy as a phase of rebellion against a divinely constituted authority. The work was so highly esteemed by James Beaton, archbishop of Glasgow, that he recommended Queen Mary to bestow on him the office of counsellor or judge of the parliament of Poitiers, the province of Poitou having by letters patent from Henry III been assigned to her in payment of a dowry. Some misunderstanding regarding the nature of this office seems to have given rise to the statement of Mackenzie and others that Blackwood was professor of civil law at Poitiers. At Poitiers he collected an extensive library, and, encouraged by the success of his previous work, he set himself to the hard and ambitious task of grappling with George Buchanan, whose views he denounced with great bitterness and severity in Apologia pro Regibus, adversus Georgii Buchanani Dialogum de Jure Regni apud Scotos, Pictavis, (1581) and Parisiis, (1588). During Queen Mary's captivity in England he paid her frequent visits, and was untiring in his efforts in her service. After her death he published a long exposure of her treatment in imprisonment, interspersed with passionate denunciations of her enemies, especially John Knox and Elizabeth I of England. The title of the work is Martyre de la Royne d'Escosse, Douairiere de France; contenant le vray discours des traïsons à elle faictes à la suscitation d'Elizabet Angloise, par lequel les mensonges, calomnies, et faulses accusations dressées contre ceste tresvertueuse, trescatholique et tresillustre princesse son esclarcies et son innocence averse. The book bears to have been printed \\"à Edimbourg chez Jean Nafield, 1587\\", but the name is fictitious, and it was in reality printed at Paris. It was reprinted at Antwerp in 1588, and again in 1589, and is also included in Samuel Jebb's collection, De Vita et Rebus gestis Mariae Scotorum Regime Autores sedecim, vol. ii., London, (1725). At the end of the Martyre there is a collection of verses in Latin, French, and Italian, on Mary and Elizabeth. A fragment of a translation of the work into English, the manuscript of which belongs to the end of the sixteenth or beginning of the seventeenth century, was published by the Maitland Club in 1834.A Translation of Adam Blackwood's History of Mary Queen of Scots, Maitland Club (1834) The work contains no contribution of importance towards the settlement of the vexed question regarding the character of the unhappy queen, but is of special interest as a graphic presentment of the sentiments and feelings which her pitiable fate aroused in her devoted adherents. In 1606 Blackwood published a poem on the accession of James VI of Scotland to the English throne, entitled Inauguratio Jacobi Magnæ Britauuitæ Regis, Paris, (1606). He was also the author of pious meditations in prose and verse, entitled Sanctarum Precationum Procemia, seu mavis, Ejaciilationes Animae ad Uranduiu se pneparantis, Aug. Pict. 1598 and 1608; of a penitential study, In Psalmum Davidis quinquagesimum, cujus initium est Miserere mei Deus, Adami Blacvodæi Meditatio, Aug. Pict. 1608; and of miscellaneous poems, Varii generis Poemata, Pictavis, 1609. He died in 1613, and was buried in the St. Porcharius church at Poictiers, where a marble monument was erected to his memory. By his marriage to Catherine Courtinier, daughter of the procureur de roi of Poitiers, he left four sons and seven daughters. His daughter Helen Blackwood married then lawyer in the Parlement of Paris and future skeptic philosopher François de la Mothe le Vayer in 1622.Kerviler, René, François de La Mothe Le Vayer, précepteur du duc d'Anjou et de Louis XIV, étude sur sa vie et sur ses écrits, Paris, Rouveyre,1879, p.23; Pintard, René, Le libertinage érudit dans la première moitié du XVIIe siècle, Genève, Slatkine, 2000 [1943], p.135 His collected works in Latin and French appeared at Paris in 1644, with a life and eulogistic notice by Gabriel Naudé.

During her stay at the casting house, Smith came into conflict with finalist Ellen Cho. Smith was ultimately selected as a cast member for The Real World, which would be set in New York, the first season of the show since 1992 to be set there. During Smith's season on The Real World, which aired in 2001, she came into conflict with Mike Mizanin over views he related to Smith from his uncle, who opined that black people were slow and uneducated. Although Mizanin attempted to disown the comments as merely those of his uncle, Smith and their other housemate, Malik Cooper, who are both black, were offended. Coral and the other housemates went on to teach Mizanin about black culture, such as the life of Malcolm X. Observing that every season of The Real World features cast members in archetypal roles, Smith asserts that she was the \\"bitch\\" of her season, though she insists that her use of this label is meant to connote her assertiveness and outspokenness, and not lack of likability.Pratt, Paul E.

During Fresh Meat, Smith's partner, Evan Starkman, developed an abdominal hernia. Smith herself sustained a leg injury, and the producers of the show removed them from the competition. This marked Smith's first Challenge in which she did not make it to the final mission. Much curiosity and speculation has arisen over Smith's relationship with Abram Boise from Road Rules: South Pacific during Battle of the Sexes 2. In response to a question by an MTV rep, Smith said: However, Smith indicated in another interview that she and Boise were not involved in a romantic relationship, and that any appearance to that effect was engineered through the use of selective editing on the part of the show's producers in order to elicit ratings. In 2005 Smith appeared on Battle of the Network Reality Stars. In January 2007 Smith appeared on the Fox network reality show, Camp Reality. In January 2008, Smith appeared on The Gauntlet III. She voluntarily left towards the end of the Challenge. This marked Smith's second Challenge in which she did not make it to the final mission. At the end of that season, at The Gauntlet III Reunion Special, Smith explained that she left because she was unwilling to tolerate what she perceived as disreputable behavior by her teammates; an observation that was corroborated by teammate Katie Doyle.

The resolution, co-sponsored by France, the United Kingdom and the United States, was adopted by a vote of 13 in favour, none against, and two abstentions from China and Russia; both countries believed the resolution constituted interference in the diplomatic relations between Lebanon and Syria. Background On April 18, 2006, the Secretary-General Kofi Annan transmitted his third semi-annual report on the implementation of Resolution 1559, adopted on September 2, 2004. Resolution 1559 called for \\"the withdrawal of all remaining foreign forces from Lebanon; the disbanding and disarmament of all Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias; the extension of the control of the Lebanese Government over all Lebanese territory; and strict respect of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity, and political independence of Lebanon under the sole and exclusive authority of the Lebanese Government throughout Lebanon.\\" The Secretary-General's report stated that many of the provisions listed in Resolution 1559, the 1989 Taif Agreement, and the lack of political stability, that Lebanon was still in a fragile and vulnerable state. This led to the adoption of the supporting resolution, 1680. Resolution Observations The Security Council began by reiterating its support for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognised borders. Furthermore, it noted that positive progress made through national dialogue, though regretted that some provisions of Resolution 1559 had not yet been fully implemented, namely the disbanding and disarming of Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias, the extension of the control of the Lebanese government over all its territory, the strict respect of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political independence of Lebanon, and free and fair presidential elections conducted according to the Lebanese constitutional rules, without foreign interference. The text of the resolution expressed concern that the Secretary-General reported a movement of arms into Lebanese territory for militias over the past six months. It expressed full support for the national dialogue and commended all Lebanese parties for their conduct. Acts The Security Council called for the full implementation of Resolution 1559, calling on all states and parties to co-operate full with the Lebanese government, Security Council and Secretary-General. It encouraged the Syrian government to respond positively to the request made Lebanon to delineate their common border (particularly in disputed areas), while noting that such measures would constitute a step towards improving relations between the two countries as well as asserting Lebanon's independence, which in turn would contribute positively to the stability in the region. The resolution praised Lebanon for undertaking measures against the movements of arms and militia into Lebanese territory and called on Syria to adopt similar measures. Finally, it welcomed the decision of the Lebanese national dialogue to disarm Palestinian militias outside refugee camps within six months.

In peacetime, the regiment was based at Kanchrapara in the 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, in its amphibious role, although \\"C\\" Squadron was re-equipped with T-55 Main Battle Tanks. In due course, the aging warhorses, the PT-76 tanks, were phased out and the 45th Cavalry Regiment was finally fully re-equipped and subsequently converted all its squadrons to the up-gunned version of the T-55 MBT.

For many years the School was a part of the education department of the West Side Branch, first on West 57th Street and then, in 1929, at 5 West 63rd Street where a separate portion of the larger building was prepared for the School. By 1935 the educational work of the City Association had increased to a point where a Schools Branch was justified. The direction of this Branch centered in McBurneys' 15 West 63rd Street building and provided for the operation of four, sometimes five, schools. This arrangement continued until, by 1957, increases in enrollment called for the accommodation of 450 boys. It was decided, therefore, to discontinue all of the departments except McBurney and the Evening High School and to prepare in 15 West 63rd street a proper setting for a college preparatory school. In September, 1958, the first part of the renovation was finished, and the building at 15 West 63rd Street was ready for McBurney use.\\"The McBurney School Catalog 1962 With the construction of Lincoln Center only a block to the west, the value of the school property increased dramatically after 1965.

History Founder The founder of Wallace Silversmiths, Robert Wallace was born in Prospect, Connecticut on November 13, 1815. He was the son of Scottish immigrant and silversmith James Wallace and his wife Irene (Williams), who had immigrated in the late 18th century. The boy had only a limited education, such as sons of the farmers of that period received. At the age of 16, Robert Wallace became an apprentice to Captain William Mix, a renowned spoon maker for the Meriden Britannia Company A Meriden Britannia apprenticeship was highly sought after because the firm was the most successful cutlery and hollowware-producing firm in the Northeast. Having mastered the art of silver craft, Robert Wallace left his apprenticeship, purchased a dilapidated gristmill, and began to produce his own cutlery. By 1833, Wallace’s silver shop was up and running. As Wallace was skilled in the art of spoon making, Wallace’s only product was spoons. Innovation One day, while shopping in New York City, Wallace happened upon a piece of cutlery made of a nickel alloy called German silver that had been produced by Dixon and Sons of Sheffield, England. Impressed by the quality and strength of the piece, Wallace bought the formula from the German chemist Dr. Louis Feuchtwanger who had a small bar of that metal from Germany for the then unheard sum of $20 and went on to build these new nickel silver spoons. Later he found a man who had brought the recipe for making the metal. Wallace purchased that too. In his factory, he then compounded the first German silver made in America and pioneered the new industry. Production Wallace moved his factory from Cheshire, Connecticut to a point on the Quinnipiac River in Wallingford, Connecticut. There he increased his production of spoons and cutlery. When his factory was in Cheshire, he produced three dozen spoons per day. In Wallingford, he made nine dozen daily. Wallace realized the importance of diversifying his business and began producing a complete range of flatware using the nickel alloy formula. It is from these humble beginnings that the Wallace Silversmiths were born. Growth For the next five decades, Wallace did contract work, producing cutlery for a number of firms throughout the world. Wallace would sign a contract with a flatware manufacturer and produce a given piece for a set number of years. Generally, these contracts lasted about 10 years. The industry continued to grow and eventually assumed large proportions during this period, Wallace produced cutlery for such firms as Hall, Elton & Co., Fred R. Curtiss Co., and Meriden Britannia Co. In 1855, Wallace partnered with Samuel Simpson to produce German flatware. During this period, the business was called R. Wallace and Co. and had represented an investment of $12,000. Later, Wallace would partner with a group of managers with the Meriden Britannia Company. At this point, the company was called Wallace, Simpson, and Co., and by 1865, the business was worth $100,000. By 1871, Wallace had purchased the balance of his partner’s shares and together with two of his sons renamed the growing company R. Wallace & Sons Mfg. Co. The factory added to its products sterling goods and high-grade nickel-silver-plated ware, both flat and hollow. Still later, by experiment, Mr. Wallace devised a new process of manufacture from steel. It made a less bulky, firmer, and lighter base for silver plating. Also In 1871, Wallace, his sons and sons-in-law formed a new company. The new company, Wallace Brothers, produced silver-plated flatware on a base of stainless steel. (By 1879, Wallace Brothers was merged with R. Wallace and Sons Mfg. Co.) In 1875, Wallace introduced the first three sterling patterns to feature the esteemed Wallace name - Hawthorne, The Crown, and St. Leon. These beautiful patterns were soon followed by sterling and silver-plated holloware. Over the next century, the company continued to grow. R. Wallace and Sons Mfg. Co. invested heavily in new machinery and skilled artisans. As American’s Gilded Age gathered steam, the firm saw continued success with additional sterling flatware designs, and began producing both plated and sterling hollowware as well. Its reputation for quality continued to grow in the early twentieth century, and more patterns were developed. Years passed and Wallace's reputation for excellence in silversmithing continued to grow. Legacy Robert Wallace died on June 1, 1892, and the sons and son-in-law continued the business. It grew to be the largest manufacturer of flat tableware in the world. At the start of the 20th century, about 3 tons of steel and 1.5 tons of nickel silver were used daily. The company opened selling houses in New York City and Chicago. The company’s success brought prosperity to Wallingford. The 1930s were spent improving R. Wallace Mfg. Co.’s mass production techniques. The company released a series of cutlery patterns created by designer William S. Warren, including Rose Point (1934), Sir Christopher (1936), Stradivari (1937), Grande Baroque (1941), Grand Colonial (1942), and Romance of the Sea (1950).(April 2, 2016). \\"R. Wallace & Sons / Wallace Silversmiths design catalogues and historical information\\". _artdesigncafe_. Retrieved May 21, 2018. These patterns are called \\"Three Dimension\\" because the design of these patterns, are apparent from the front, back, or profile. Each of these patterns remains popular. In 1947, the designer wrote a book - and it was published by Wallace Silversmiths - called \\"Wallace Beauty Moods in Silver\\" to discuss five of the six \\"Three Dimension\\" designs. It was with the introduction of the now famous Grande Baroque pattern in 1941, that Wallace truly established itself as a prominent name in the silver industry. Sales of this magnificent three-dimensional pattern exceeded even the most ambitious projections and Wallace was soon growing through acquisition at a remarkable clip. In 1956 R. Wallace and Sons Mfg. Co. purchased the Watson Company and relocated to The Watson Company's Wallingford, Connecticut factory. After the company’s relocation, its name became Wallace Silversmiths. Shortly thereafter, in 1958, they purchased both the Tuttle Silver Company and Smith & Smith Company. As a result of this growth, the Hamilton Watch Company of Lancaster, Pennsylvania acquired Wallace Silversmiths in 1959. Over the next three decades, the ownership of Wallace Silversmiths would change three more times. Wallace Silversmiths remained a subsidiary of the Hamilton Watch Company (Hamilton Watch sold Wallace Stainless Divisionpersonal knowledge to Vose Associates in 1963 or 1964) until 1983 when the then 150-year-old company was sold to Katy Industries of Elgin, Illinois. In 1986, Syratech Corporation, which also owned Towle Silversmiths, acquired Wallace Silversmiths from Katy Industries. On April 1, 1987, Wallace Silversmiths' corporate headquarters was moved from Connecticut to East Boston, MA. In 2006, Lifetime Brands acquired Syratech's assets. The company continues to design sterling, silverplate, and stainless steel flatware. References External links * www.wallacesilver.com Website (www.wallacesilver.com) comes up not found.

McGinness worked in the fields of organic electronics and nanotechnology. Education McGinness studied physics at the University of Houston, and after his B.S. in 1966 he received his PhD in physics at Rice University in 1970. He received his MD from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) in 1985 and worked in internal medicine for one year, changing to psychiatry and working at the Department of Psychiatry, UTHealth, from 1989–1992. He authored roughly 40 research publications, book chapters, and presentations. Work John McGinness materially contributed to the modern field of organic electronics.\\"An Overview of the First Half-Century of Molecular Electronics\\" by Noel S. Hush, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1006: 1–20 (2003). An organic polymer voltage-controlled switch from 1974. Now in the Smithsonian Chip collectionSmithsonian Chip collection In 1972, while working at the Metallurgy department at Youngstown State University, McGinness suggested that electronic conduction in melanins (polyacetylene, polypyrrole, and polyaniline \\"blacks\\" and their copolymers) is analogous to conduction in amorphous solids such as the chalcogenide glasses. This area was originally pioneered by Nevill Mott, among others. That is, it involves such things as mobility gaps, phonon-assisted hopping, polarons, quantum tunneling, and so forth. From Youngstown, McGinness moved to the Physics Department of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. The department had an interest in the physical properties of melanin as a possible hook to treating melanoma. While of enormous importance now, this area was a research backwater at the time. With the notable exception of Bolto et al., who had reported high conductivity in iodine-doped polypyrrole, few but melanoma researchers had much reason to look at the electronic properties of such rigid-backbone polymer \\"blacks\\". This is why the putative first molecular electronic device came from a cancer hospital. The chalcogenide glasses show \\"switching\\", in which an applied \\"threshold voltage\\" reversibly switches a material from a low-conductivity \\"OFF\\" state to a high-conductivity \\"ON' state. The similarity of conduction mechanisms suggested that the melanins might also demonstrate voltage-controlled switching. Following this lead, McGinness and his MD Anderson coworkers constructed a voltage-controlled switch incorporating melanin as its active element . They also further characterized its electronic behavior.Mizutani, U., Massalski, T., McGinness, J.E., and Corry, P.: Anomalous low temperature specific heat results in melanins and intact melanosomes.

He was the first to show that the kidney toxicity of cisplatin involves reactive oxygen species.\\"An Overview of the First Half- Century of Molecular Electronics\\" by Noel S. Hush, Ann. N.Y. Acad.

It is mostly prevalent in Hungary, Albania, Serbia and the United States.Dobi Family  Etymology  The surname may originate from the Hungarian personal name Dabó (Transylvanian form Dobó), or from a pet form of the personal name Dob. Another theory on the origin of the Dobi surname may be as a diminutive of the Saxon personal name Hrodebert (ancient form of the English name Robert).  Dobi surname in Albania  Shield of the Dobi Family of Gjirokastra The Dobi surname in Albania is found among members of the same family, which originates from the region of Gjirokastra, and nowadays hails primarily in the capital city of Tirana, but a large number of them have settled in other countries, such as Turkey or the United States.  History  The main branch of the Dobi family in Albania is considered to be one of the oldest families of the medieval city of Gjirokastra and it is believed that they had first settled in the citadel inside the Castle of Gjirokastra by the year 1380. Since then, there have been 30 generations of people with the Dobi surname.Donika Anxhaku & Zenel Anxhaku \\"100 Familje Shqiptare\\", (Tiranë: Botimet KUMI, 2010), 83. A line of the Dobi family had established landholdings in the village of Damës, in the region of Tepelena, but by the end of the 16th century most of them had moved to Gjirokastra and the cadet branch of the family that stayed back in Damës formed the core of the Iliriani family.Baftjar Dobi, \\"Gjirokastra jonë\\", kap. \\"Pak fjalë mbi fisin Dobi\\", (Tiranë: Albin, 2001). According to legend, throughout the centuries the Dobi family has been involved mainly with commerce, especially in the trade of mules for transport, which helps explain the presence of the mule in escutcheon of the Family's heraldic coat of arms. By the 1780s, members of the Dobi family started spreading from their dwellings inside the Castle to other areas of the city, mainly in the \\"Hazmurat\\" neighborhood. These new dwellings were mainly of 2 to 3 stories high and surrounded by thick stone walls. In architectural style, they were similar to the other tower houses typical of Gjirokastra, the most famous of which being the Zekate House. Throughout the years, the Dobi family continued growing and expanding throughout the city in other desirable neighborhoods, such as \\"Upper Palorto\\", \\"Lower Palorto\\", \\"Manalat\\" and \\"Cfarkë\\",Donika Anxhaku & Zenel Anxhaku \\"100 Familje Shqiptare\\", (Tiranë: Botimet KUMI, 2010), 84. and by 1945 they were considered to be one of the largest families of Gjirokastra, with 6 major branches.Artikull: Dobajt, soji i mirë i Gjirokastrës Members of the Dobi family of Gjirokastra have been active in the struggle for Albanian Independence and in WWII fighting against fascism, where is worth mentioning Istref Dobi, who at 17 years of age took part in the armed conflict for the liberation of Vlora in 1920, or the 12 members of the Dobi family who were active in the Antifascist National Liberation Movement of Albania during WWII. After the end of WWII, many members of the Dobi family moved from Gjirokastra towards the capital city, Tirana, a process which had started since the 1930s, and as a consequence there are only 3 families bearing the Dobi surname living in Gjirokastra at the moment. In addition to migration inside of Albania, many members of the Dobi family emigrated to other countries, especially to Thessaloniki in modern-day Greece or the cities of Istanbul and Izmir in Turkey. In the 1990s, as with many other Albanians, many members of the Dobi family emigrated towards the United States, and nowadays Albanians with the Dobi surname have settled primarily in the states of New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.  Notable Albanians with the Dobi surname  Most of the members of the Dobi family of Albania have traditionally been involved with commerce and civil administration, being well-respected in the fields of jurisprudence, education, military, engineering and natural sciences. In these fields, it is worth noting the contribution of Kledin Dobi in mathematics; Haki Dobi in finance; Arben Dobi and Drini Dobi in health care. Also, successors of the Dobi family of Gjirokastra have been involved in Albanian politics, as is the case of Bashkim Kopliku, former Deputy Prime Minister and former Minister of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Albania, the oldest son of lady Kadrie Dobi a respected lecturer of History and a graduate of the University of Rome.Ndue Bacaj: Dr. Bahri Kopliku, figurë e shquar e mjeksisë Others have affirmed themselves in the field of literature, where it is worth noting the poetry of Nesibe Dobi, believed to be the first female poet of Albanian literature, and Ismail Kadare an Albanian writer of world renown, and the son of lady Hatixhe Dobi.Donika Anxhaku & Zenel Anxhaku \\"100 Familje Shqiptare\\", (Tiranë: Botimet KUMI, 2010), 84-86.Ismail Kadare, \\"Kukulla\\", (Tiranë: Onufri, 2015), 18.

The contract for the Imperial Chain was terminated by the Post Office after the outbreak of war and the station was not used for its original function when Leafield was resurrected after the War. The remaining concrete bases from the original masts The structure was converted to military use in 1916 for the Royal Engineers as an army intelligence station, used to determine the position of German Zeppelins and communication stations. The plans for the structure showed masts high and long.

In the days prior to the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, airlines (other than small commuters) were required to operate with a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. Air New England operated principally with a fleet of de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and Fairchild Hiller FH-227 turboprop aircraft. ANE was formed in November 1970 by Joseph Whitney, Nelson Lee, formerly of Executive Airlines and George Parmenter of Cape and Island Airways. Based in Hyannis, MA, they operated Beech 18s and a Twin Otter around the Cape and Islands, Boston and La Guardia. They expanded in 1971 with the first of 6 DC-3s. 1972 and 1973 saw more expansion with additional Twin Otters and Beech 99 turboprops. The Beech 18s were retired at this point. By 1974 the airline had expanded into Maine, Vermont, New York and would fly to all six New England states by 1978. In 1975 Air New England received Part 121 certification and added FH-227s, bought from Delta Air Lines, to the fleet. Additional FH-227s were purchased from Ozark and by 1979, Convair 580 turboprops were added as well. By this time the Beech 99's and DC-3s had been retired. Major expansion outside of the northeast U.S. occurred in 1979 to Albany, NY, Baltimore-Washington and Cleveland, but the handwriting was on the wall as the effects of airline deregulation began to materialize. ANE shutdown on October 31, 1981, with 400 employees. The company cited \\"intolerable financial losses\\" caused by competition, lack of federal subsidies, cumulative expenses, and a decrease in revenue caused by the contemporaneous strike by the air-traffic controllers' union, PATCO. ANE had been carrying close to 600,000 passengers a year in 1980. In 1981, it depended on $6.1 million in federal subsidies to cover operating costs. During its 12-year existence, the airline suffered only one serious incident/crash [cited below] and had one of the highest safety/reliability ratings of all American based airlines over that 12-year period.\\" An on-demand charter operator named Air New England based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Portland, Maine, has been operating since 2010.

Cooperative breeding encompasses a wide variety of group structures, from a breeding pair with helpers that are offspring from a previous season, to groups with multiple breeding males and females (polygynandry) and helpers that are the adult offspring of some but not all of the breeders in the group, to groups in which helpers sometimes achieve co-breeding status by producing their own offspring as part of the group's brood. Cooperative breeding occurs across taxonomic groups including birds, mammals, fish, and insects. Costs for helpers include a fitness reduction, increased territory defense, offspring guarding and an increased cost of growth. Benefits for helpers include a reduced chance of predation, increased foraging time, territory inheritance, increased environmental conditions and an inclusive fitness. Inclusive fitness is the sum of all direct and indirect fitness, where direct fitness is defined as the amount of fitness gained through producing offspring. Indirect fitness is defined as the amount of fitness gained through aiding related individuals offspring, that is relatives are able to indirectly pass on their genes through increasing the fitness of related offspring.Nicholas B. Davies, John R. Krebs, S. A. W. An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology.pdf. 522 (2012). This is also called kin selection. For the breeding pair, costs include increased mate guarding and suppression of subordinate mating. Breeders receive benefits as reductions in offspring care and territory maintenance. Their primary benefit is an increased reproductive rate and survival. Cooperative breeding causes the reproductive success of all sexually mature adults to be skewed towards one mating pair. This means the reproductive fitness of the group is held within a select few breeding members and helpers have little to no reproductive fitness. With this system, breeders gain an increased reproductive fitness, while helpers gain an increased inclusive fitness. Evolution Many hypotheses have been presented to explain the evolution of cooperative breeding. The concept behind cooperative breeding is the forfeiting of an individual's reproductive fitness to aid the reproductive success of others. This concept is hard to understand and the evolution of cooperative breeding is important, but difficult to explain. Most hypotheses aim to determine the reason helpers selectively reduce their fitness and take on an alloparental role. Kin selection is the evolutionary strategy of aiding the reproductive success of related organisms, even at a cost to the own individual's direct fitness. Hamilton's rule (rB−C>0) explains that kin selection will exist if the genetic relatedness (r) of the aided recipient to the aiding individual, times the benefit to the aid recipient (B) is greater than the cost to the aiding individual (C). For example, the chestnut-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus ruficeps) has been found to have high rates of kin selection. Helpers are predominantly found aiding closely related broods over nonrelated broods. Additional species such as Neolamprologus pulcher have shown that kin selection is a dominant driving force for cooperative breeding. Group augmentation presents a second hypothesis towards the evolution of cooperative breeding. This hypothesis suggests that increasing the size of the group through the addition of helpers aids in individual survival and may increase the helper's future breeding success. Group augmentation is favored if the grouping provides passive benefits for helpers in addition to inclusive fitness. By group augmenting, each individual member reduces their chances of becoming a victim of predation. Additionally, an increase in members reduces each helper's duration as a sentinel (standing upon a high surface to survey for predators) or babysitting (guarding the offspring and den). The reduction in these guarding behaviors enables helpers to forage for longer periods. Lukas et al. proposed an evolutionary model for cooperative breeding, which linked the coevolution of polytocy, production of multiple offspring, and monotocy, production of single offspring, with the evolution of cooperative breeding. The model is based on the evolution of larger litters forcing the need for helpers to maintain the high reproductive costs, thus leading to cooperative breeding. Lukas et al. suggests polytocy may have encouraged the evolution of cooperative breeding. Their proposed model suggests the transition from monotocy to polytocy is favorable. Additionally, they found the transition from polytocy without cooperative breeding to polytocy with cooperative breeding is highly favorable. This suggests cooperative breeding evolved from noncooperative breeding monotocy to cooperative breeding polytocy. Today, there is growing support for the theory that cooperative breeding evolved by means of some form of mutualism or reciprocity. Mutualism is a form of symbiosis that is beneficial to both involved organisms. Mutualism has many forms and can occur when the benefits are immediate or deferred, when individuals exchange beneficial behaviors in turn, or when a group of individuals contribute to a common good, where it may be advantageous for all group members to help raise young. When a group raises young together, it may be advantageous because it maintains or increases the size of the group. The greatest amount of research has been invested in reciprocal exchanges of beneficial behavior through the iterated prisoner's dilemma. In this model, two partners can either cooperate and exchange beneficial behavior or they can defect and refuse to help the other individual. Environmental conditions Environmental conditions govern whether offspring disperse from their natal group or remain as helpers. Food or territory availability can encourage individuals to disperse and establish new breeding territories, but unfavorable conditions promote offspring to remain at the natal territory and become helpers to obtain an inclusive fitness. Additionally, remaining at the natal territory enables offspring to possibly inherit the breeding role and/or territory of their parents. A final factor influencing cooperative breeding is sexual dispersal. Sexual dispersal is the movement of one sex, male or female, from the natal territory to establish new breeding grounds. This is highly regulated by the reproductive costs in producing a male versus a female offspring. Maternal investment within female offspring may be considerably higher than male offspring for one species, or vice versa for another. During unfavorable conditions the cheaper sex will be produced at higher ratios. A second factor affecting the sexual dispersal is the difference in ability of each sex to establish a new breeding territory. Carrion crow (Corvus corone) were found to produce more female offspring in favorable environmental conditions. Female Corvus corone have been found to establish successful breeding territories at a higher rate than males. Male Corvus corone were produced at a higher rate under unfavorable conditions. Males were found to remain at the natal territory and become helpers. Thus, if environmental conditions favor the dispersal of a specific sex it is considered the dispersal sex. If environmental conditions are unfavorable females may produce the philopatric sex, therefore generating more helpers and increasing the occurrence of cooperative breeding. Costs Breeders Breeder costs consist of prenatal care, postnatal care and maintenance of breeding status. Prenatal care is the amount of maternal investment during fetus gestation and postnatal care is the investment following birth. Examples of prenatal care are fetal, placentae, uterus and mammary tissue development. Postnatal examples are lactation, food provisions and guarding behavior. Dominant males and females exhibit suppressive behaviors towards subordinates to maintain their breeding status. These suppressive acts are dependent upon the sex ratio of helpers. Therefore, the costs will be altered depending upon the helpers. For example, if there are more male helpers as compared to females, then the dominant male will suppress subordinate males and experience a higher cost. The opposite is true for females. Breeders will even suppress subordinates from mating with other subordinates. Helpers The cost to helpers varies depending upon presence or absence of related offspring. The presence of offspring has been found to increase the helper's cost by the helper contributing to guard behaviors. Guarding behaviors, such as babysitting, can cause individuals to experience weight loss on an exponential scale depending upon the duration of the activity. Other activities, such as sentinel behavior and bipedal surveillance, cause helpers to have reduced foraging intervals inhibiting their weight gains. The reduced foraging behavior and increased weight loss reduces their chance to breed successfully, but increase their inclusive fitness by increasing the survival of related offspring. Helpers contribute depending upon the cost. The act of helping requires an allocation of energy towards actually performing the behavior. Prolonged allocation of energy may greatly impact a helper's growth. In banded mongoose (Mungos mungo) juvenile male helpers contribute far less than females. This is due to a difference in the age of sexual maturity. Female banded mongooses reach sexual maturity at one year of age, but males reach sexual maturity at two years of age. The difference in age causes the prolonged energy allocation to be detrimental to a specific sex. Male juvenile Mungos mungo may reduce helping behaviors until sexual maturity is reached. Similarly, if there is a lack of food due to environmental conditions, such as reduced rainfall, the degree of helper input may be reduced greatly within juveniles. Adults may maintain their full activity because they are sexually mature. Additionally, the costs of being a helper can be more detrimental to one sex. For example, territorial defense costs are generally male dependent and lactation is female dependent. Meerkats (Suricata suricatta) have exhibited male territory defense strategies, where male helpers will fend off intruding males to prevent such intruders from mating with subordinates or dominant females. Additionally, subordinate female pregnant helpers are sometimes exiled from the group by a dominant female. This eviction causes the subordinate female to have an abortion, which frees up resources such as lactation and energy that can be used to help the dominant female and her pups. Rarely, a female helper or breeder will defend the territory while males are present. This suggests specific helping costs, such as territory defense, is rooted to one sex. Benefits Breeders Cooperative breeding reduces the costs of many maternal investments for breeding members. Helpers aid the breeding females with provisioning, lactation stress, guarding of offspring and prenatal investment. Increasing the number of helpers enables a breeding female or male to maintain a healthier physique, higher fitness, increased lifespan and brood size. Female helpers can aid in lactation, but all helpers, male or female, can aid in food provisioning. Helper food provisioning reduces the need for the dominant breeding pair to return to the den, thus allowing them to forage for longer periods. The dominant female and male will adjust their care input, or food provisioning, depending on the degree of activity of the helpers. The presence of helpers allows the breeding female to reduce her prenatal investment in the offspring, which may lead to altricial births; altricial is the production of young which are dependent upon adult aid to survive. This enables the breeding female to retain energy to be used within a new breeding attempt. Overall, the addition of helpers to a breeding pair encourages multiple reproductions per year, and increases the rate of successful reproduction. Male breeders can benefit directly from reproducing with subordinate females and aiding in raising the young. This allows the male to obtain a “repayment investment” within these subordinate offspring. These offspring have a higher chance to become helpers once sexual maturity is reached. Thus, paying into their care will increase the dominant male's overall fitness in the future. This act ensures the dominant male subordinate helpers for future reproduction. Helpers Helpers primarily benefit from an inclusive fitness. Helpers maintain an inclusive fitness while aiding related breeders and offspring. This type of kinship may lead to inheritance of quality foraging and breeding territories, which will increase the future fitness of helpers. Additional, helpers experience an increased chance of being helped if they were once a helper. Finally, helpers benefit from group interactions, such as huddling for thermodynamic benefits. These interactions provide necessary elements to survive. They may also benefit from the increased group interaction on the level of cognitive concern for one another increasing their overall life span and survival. Biological examples Birds Approximately eight percent of bird species are known to regularly engage in cooperative breeding, mainly among the Coraciiformes, Piciformes, basal Passeri and Sylvioidea. Only a small fraction of these, for instance the Australian mudnesters, Australo-Papuan babblers and ground hornbills, are however absolutely obligately cooperative and cannot fledge young without helpers.See Cockburn, Andrew; \\"Prevalence of different modes of parental care in birds\\" The benefits of cooperative breeding in birds have been well- documented. One example is the azure-winged magpie (Cyanopica cyanus), in which studies found that the offspring's cell-mediated immune response was positively correlated with increase in the number of helpers at the nest. Studies on cooperative breeding in birds have also shown that high levels of cooperative breeding are strongly associated with low annual adult mortality and small clutch sizes, though it remains unclear whether cooperative breeding is a cause or consequence. It was originally suggested that cooperative breeding developed among bird species with low mortality rates as a consequence of “overcrowding” and thus fewer opportunities to claim territory and breed. However, many observers today believe cooperative breeding arose because of the need for helpers to rear young in the extremely infertile and unpredictable environmentsSee McMahon T.A. and Finlayson, B.; Global Runoff: Continental Comparisons of Annual Flows and Peak Discharges. of Australia and sub-Saharan Africa under the rare favourable conditions.  Mammals  Across all mammalian species, less than 1% exhibit cooperative breeding strategies. Phylogenetic analysis shows evidence of fourteen discrete evolutionary transitions to cooperative breeding within the class Mammalia. These lineages are nine genera of rodents (Cryptomys, Heterocephalus, Microtus, Meriones, Rhabdomys, Castor, Atherurus and two in Peromyscus), four genera in Carnivora (Alopex, Canis, Lycaon, and in mongooses), and one genera of primates (Callitrichidae). Cooperative breeding in mammals is not limited to these stated lineages, rather they are significant evolutionary events that provide the framework for understanding the origins and evolutionary pressures of cooperative breeding. All of these evolutionary transitions have occurred in lineages that had a socially monogamous or solitary breeding system, suggesting that strong kinship ties are an essential factor the evolutionary history of cooperative breeding. Additionally, polytocy, or the birth of multiple offspring per birthing episode, is a highly correlated evolutionary determinant of cooperative breeding in mammals. These two factors, social monogamy and polytocy, are not evolutionary associated, suggesting that they independent mechanisms leading to the evolution of cooperative breeding in mammals. The global distribution of mammals with cooperative breeding systems is widespread across various climatic regions, but evidence shows that the initial transitions to cooperative breeding are associated to species in regions of high aridity. =Meerkats= An older female watches over pups while alpha female is away. Meerkats become reproductively active at one year of age and can have up to four litters per year. However, usually it is the alpha pair that reserves the right to mate and will usually kill any young that is not their own. While the alpha female is away from the group, females that have never reproduced lactate and hunt in order to feed the pups, as well as watch, protect, and defend them from predators. Although it was previously thought that a meerkat's contribution to a pup's diet depended on the degree of relatedness, it has been found that helpers vary in the number of food items they give to pups. This variation in food offering is due to variation in foraging success, sex, and age. Research has additionally found that the level of help is not correlated to the kinship of the litters they are rearing. =Canids= Cooperative breeding has been described in several canid speciesMoehlman, Patricia D., and H. E. R. I. B. E. R. T. Hofer. \\"Cooperative breeding, reproductive suppression, and body mass in canids.\\" Cooperative breeding in mammals (1997): 76-128. including red wolves, Arctic foxes and Ethiopian wolves. Cooperative breeding increases the rate of reproduction in females and decreases the litter size. =Primates= Cooperative breeding entails one or more individuals, usually females, acting as \\"helpers\\" to one or a few dominant female breeders, usually helpers' kin. This sociosexual system is rare in primates, so far demonstrated among Neotropical callitricids, including marmosets and tamarins. Cooperative breeding requires \\"repression\\" of helpers' reproduction, by pheromones emitted by a breeder, by coercion, or by self-restraint. Sarah Blaffer Hrdy believes that cooperative breeding is an ancestral trait in humans, a controversial proposition. In most non-human primates, the reproductive success and survival of offspring is highly dependent to the mother's ability to produce food resources. Therefore, one component of cooperative breeding is the delegation of offspring holding, which allows the mother to forage without the added costs of holding her offspring. Additionally, in primate species with cooperative breeding systems, females have shorter interbirth intervals. Female grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) form social groups and cooperatively breed with closely related female kin. The females benefit from sharing limited nesting spaces and increased nest defense but do not exhibit food provisioning behaviors as they are solitary foragers.  Humans  Direct expression of cooperative breeding includes facultative parental care, including alloparenting, and extended post-menopausal lifespan in females, which forms the basis of the Grandmother Hypothesis. Cooperative breeding in humans is theorized as the optimal solution to high energetic costs of survival due to nature of human diet, which involved high-quality foods often in need of processing and cooking. Additionally, food provisioning in cooperate breeding societies may explain the relatively short period of weaning in humans, typically two to three years, when compared to non-human apes who wean their offspring for upwards of six years. Human offspring do not fall neatly into the dichotomous categorization of precocial versus altricial, and instead Portmann proposes they are \\"secondarily altricial\\" at birth due to the underdevelopment of neurological and cognitive capabilities. Therefore, human offspring are highly dependent on caregiver investment, a necessity that serves as the precursor for theories on the development of pair-bonding, alloparenting, and cooperative breeding. The evolution of cooperative breeding in early Homo species also promoted other pro-social behaviors such as social learning, increased social tolerance, and shared intentionality especially in food acquisition. Additionally, pro-social behaviors in cooperative breeding in humans had a by-product effect of enhancing cognitive capabilities, especially in social tasks involving coordination. Human mother's tend to have overlapping, dependent offspring due to shorter interbirth intervals, high fertility rates, and low infant mortality rates, thus imposing high energetic costs. Unlike other species with cooperative breeding systems, human female \\"helpers\\" do not incur the cost of reproductive suppression at the benefit of a single, dominant breeding mother. Instead, cooperative breeding is highly prevalent among grandparents, and juveniles, who are generally not competing for mating opportunities. This intergenerational flow of resources supports the theory of mutualism as an evolutionary pathway to cooperative breeding in humans.

Early 20th-century operas of this type include Paul Hindemith's Cardillac (1926). Earlier small-scale operas such as Pergolesi's La serva padrona (1733) are sometimes known as chamber operas.\\"Chamber Opera\\" in Oxford Music Online, accessed 19 December 2016. . Other 20th-century examples include Gustav Holst's Savitri (1916). Benjamin Britten wrote works in this category in the 1940s when the English Opera Group needed works that could easily be taken on tour and performed in a variety of small performance spaces. The Rape of Lucretia (1946) was his first example in the genre, and Britten followed it with Albert Herring (1947), The Turn of the Screw (1954) and Curlew River (1964). Other composers, including Hans Werner Henze, Harrison Birtwistle, Thomas Adès, George Benjamin, William Walton, and Philip Glass have written in this genre. Instrumentation for chamber operas vary: Britten scored The Rape of Lucretia for eight singers with single strings and wind with piano, harp and percussion. Humphrey Searle's The Diary of a Madman (1958) is scored for four voices and an orchestra of single strings, woodwind and brass, with two percussionists. An electronic tape is also specified to produce particular sound effects.Searle (1958), p. (iii). Judith Weir's King Harald's Saga (1979) is for a single soprano voice.

Doughty became a captain of the 2nd Continental Artillery Regiment in January 1777 and served as an aide-de-camp to Major General Philip Schuyler. Later, he was assigned to command the New York State Artillery Company in March 1777. Doughty would participate in the battles of Brandywine (1777), Germantown (1777), Monmouth (1778), Springfield (1780), and Yorktown (1781). He was appointed brigade major of the Corps of Artillery in 1779 and was appointed fort major for the West Point garrison in 1782.

On August 12 of the same year, an Infantry regiment was organized under Brevet Brigadier General Josiah Harmar, who then became the senior officer in the United States Army. On that date, Doughty was promoted to major and placed in command of a battalion of two companies of artillery. In this position he superintended the construction of Fort Harmar (1785) and Fort Washington (1789) on the Ohio frontier. Doughty was designated major commandant of the Battalion of Artillery in September 1789, and then was dispatched by President Washington to the frontier to negotiate with the Choctaw Nation for trading post sites in 1789.

The zoo is located within the Hengrabari Reserved Forest at Guwahati, India. The zoo is home to about 895 animals, birds and reptiles representing almost 113 species of animals and birds from around the world. The Divisional officer of Assam State Zoo is Mr Tejas Mariswamy from Mysore, Karnataka. History The 64th session of Indian National Congress was held in Guwahati, in the year 1957. The Organising committee of INC organised an exhibit with included few animals and birds, of which a female leopard cub named Spotty was the favourite. After the meeting came to an end, it was felt to necessity of a zoo to house these animals. These animals were shifted to Japorigog in the Hengrabari Reserve forest, with an area of 130 Hectare, suitable to create facilities and house these animals, thus, The Assam State Zoo was established in the year 1957 and was open to public viewing in the year 1958. The total number of animals and birds, at the time of its inception was 42 (22 species) and 236 (31 species) respectively. Over the years, the zoo grew and expanded to accommodate eye-catching exotic ones like chimpanzees, white rhinos & black rhinos, zebras, ostriches and giraffes from Africa; puma, jaguar and llama from South America and kangaroos from Australia. To get these exotic animals the zoo used to send indigenous animals like one horned Indian rhinoceros and others, to many countries. Through later the importance was shifted to indigenous species and several captive breeding programs also started which were successful. In the year 1959 a forest division was created as Assam State Zoo Division and the zoo was put under this division. The Assam State Zoo also added a museum and in the year 1982 a botanical garden and so Assam State Zoo became The Assam State Zoo cum Botanical Garden. In 2002 another 45 hectare area of the Hengrabari Reserve Forests were added to the zoo and thus, the total area of the zoo became 175 hectare and in August, 2005 the Animal Adoption Scheme launched.

In the census of 2001, it had a population of 4,530 inhabitants and a total area of 3.47 km². A 2013 law amalgamated it into the new União das Freguesias de Aguçadoura e Navais. The name of Aguçadoura derives from \\"petra aguzadoira\\" (sharp stone or stone to sharp farming tools). History Shield used during periods while it was a civil parish. Aguçadoura is the newest parish of Póvoa de Varzim; it was created on October 14 of 1933, when it separated from the parish of Navais, to which it always belonged. The first reference to the place appears in 1258: in Petra Aguzadoira que est in termino de Nabaes. The inhabitants had a difficult time settling in the area, and it was only constituted by sand dunes that were constantly blown by the wind. Only in the 18th century, the settlement gained some importance and, in 1730, there were already 25 families, and in middle of the 19th century its population was greater than that of Navais. Thus Aguçadoura separated from Navais in 1933. Geography Aguçadoura is located 6 km north of downtown Póvoa de Varzim; and has as borders: the ocean to the west, and the parishes of Estela to the north, Navais to the east, and A Ver-o-Mar to the south. This parish is recognized for its beaches: Aguçadoura Beach, Codicheira Beach and Barranha Beach. Its territory once dominated by Masseira farm fields is now dominated by green houses. The parish is very competitive in the garden crops sector, despite most of the parish is located in former arid sandy dunes. Fertilization of its soils was done through generations of farmers by gathering sargassum seaweed from the ocean, to fertilize the infertile soil. The parish is home to Póvoa de Varzim Horticulture Association - the Horpozim. Among other small businesses, there is also a minor floriculture business. Hamlets The parish is divided in seven hamlets: Santo André, Granjeiro, Caturela, Fieiro, Areosa, Aldeia, and Codicheira.

Overview Polish philosophy drew upon the broader currents of European philosophy, and in turn contributed to their growth. Among the most momentous Polish contributions were made, in the thirteenth century, by the Scholastic philosopher and scientist Witelo, and, in the sixteenth century, by the Renaissance polymath Nicolaus Copernicus.Władysław Tatarkiewicz, Zarys dziejów filozofii w Polsce (A Brief History of Philosophy in Poland), p. 32. Subsequently, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth partook in the intellectual ferment of the Enlightenment, which for the multi-ethnic Commonwealth ended not long after the partitions and political annihilation that would last for the next 123 years, until the collapse of the three partitioning empires in World War I. The period of Messianism, between the November 1830 and January 1863 Uprisings, reflected European Romantic and Idealist trends, as well as a Polish yearning for political resurrection. It was a period of maximalist metaphysical systems. The collapse of the January 1863 Uprising prompted an agonizing reappraisal of Poland's situation. Poles gave up their earlier practice of \\"measuring their resources by their aspirations,\\" and buckled down to hard work and study. \\"[A] Positivist,\\" wrote the novelist Bolesław Prus' friend, Julian Ochorowicz, was \\"anyone who bases assertions on verifiable evidence; who does not express himself categorically about doubtful things, and does not speak at all about those that are inaccessible.\\"Władysław Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii (History of Philosophy), vol. 3, p. 177. The twentieth century brought a new quickening to Polish philosophy. There was growing interest in western philosophical currents. Rigorously trained Polish philosophers made substantial contributions to specialized fields—to psychology, the history of philosophy, the theory of knowledge, and especially mathematical logic.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 32. Jan Łukasiewicz gained world fame with his concept of many- valued logic and his \\"Polish notation.\\"Kazimierz Kuratowski, A Half Century of Polish Mathematics, pp. 23–24, 33. Alfred Tarski's work in truth theory won him world renown.Kazimierz Kuratowski, A Half Century of Polish Mathematics, p. 30 and passim. After World War II, for over four decades, world-class Polish philosophers and historians of philosophy such as Władysław Tatarkiewicz continued their work, often in the face of adversities occasioned by the dominance of a politically enforced official philosophy. The phenomenologist Roman Ingarden did influential work in esthetics and in a Husserl-style metaphysics; his student Karol Wojtyła acquired a unique influence on the world stage as Pope John Paul II. Scholasticism Page from a manuscript of De perspectiva, with miniature of its author Witelo Thuringo- Pole Witelo) The formal history of philosophy in Poland may be said to have begun in the fifteenth century, following the revival of the University of Kraków by King Władysław II Jagiełło in 1400.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 5. The true beginnings of Polish philosophy, however, reach back to the thirteenth century and Vitello (c. 1230 – c. 1314), a Silesian born to a Polish mother and a Thuringian settler, a contemporary of Thomas Aquinas who had spent part of his life in Italy at centers of the highest intellectual culture. In addition to being a philosopher, he was a scientist who specialized in optics. His famous treatise, Perspectiva, while drawing on the Arabic Book of Optics by Alhazen, was unique in Latin literature,Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 5. and in turn helped inspire Roger Bacon's best work, Part V of his Opus maius, \\"On Perspectival Science,\\" as well as his supplementary treatise On the Multiplication of Vision.Will Durant, The Age of Faith, p. 1011. Witelo's Perspectiva additionally made important contributions to psychology: it held that vision per se apprehends only colors and light while all else, particularly the distance and size of objects, is established by means of association and unconscious deduction. Witelo's concept of being was one rare in the Middle Ages, neither Augustinian as among conservatives nor Aristotelian as among progressives, but Neoplatonist. It was an emanationist concept that held radiation to be the prime characteristic of being, and ascribed to radiation the nature of light. This \\"metaphysic of light\\" inclined Witelo to optical research, or perhaps vice versa his optical studies led to his metaphysic.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., pp. 5–6. According to the Polish historian of philosophy, Władysław Tatarkiewicz, no Polish philosopher since Witelo has enjoyed so eminent a European standing as this thinker who belonged, in a sense, to the prehistory of Polish philosophy.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 6. Kraków University's Collegium Maius, a site of Polish higher learning since 1400 From the beginning of the fifteenth century, Polish philosophy, centered at Kraków University, pursued a normal course. It no longer harbored exceptional thinkers such as Witelo, but it did feature representatives of all wings of mature Scholasticism, via antiqua as well as via moderna. The first of these to reach Kraków was via moderna, then the more widespread movement in Europe.Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 1, p. 311. In physics, logic and ethics, Terminism (Nominalism) prevailed in Kraków, under the influence of the French Scholastic, Jean Buridan (died c. 1359), who had been rector of the University of Paris and an exponent of views of William of Ockham. Buridan had formulated the theory of \\"impetus\\"—the force that causes a body, once set in motion, to persist in motion—and stated that impetus is proportional to the speed of, and amount of matter comprising, a body: Buridan thus anticipated Galileo and Isaac Newton. His theory of impetus was momentous in that it also explained the motions of celestial bodies without resort to the spirits—\\"intelligentiae\\"—to which the Peripatetics (followers of Aristotle) had ascribed those motions.Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 1, pp. 303–4. At Kraków, physics was now expounded by (St.) Jan Kanty (1390–1473), who developed this concept of \\"impetus.\\" A general trait of the Kraków Scholastics was a provlivity for compromise—for reconciling Nominalism with the older tradition. For example, the Nominalist, Benedict Hesse, while in principle accepting the theory of impetus, did not apply it to the heavenly spheres. In the second half of the fifteenth century, at Kraków, via antiqua became dominant. Nominalism retreated, and the old Scholasticism triumphed. In this period, Thomism had its chief center at Cologne, whence it influenced Kraków. Cologne, formerly the home ground of Albertus Magnus, had preserved Albert's mode of thinking. Thus the Cologne philosophers formed two wings, the Thomist and Albertist, and even Cologne's Thomists showed Neoplatonist traits characteristic of Albert, affirming emanation, a hierarchy of being, and a metaphysic of light. The chief Kraków adherents of the Cologne-style Thomism included Jan of Głogów (c. 1445 – 1507) and Jakub of Gostynin (c. 1454 – 1506). Another, purer teacher of Thomism was Michał Falkener of Wrocław (c. 1450 – 1534).Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., pp. 6–7. Almost at the same time, Scotism appeared in Poland, having been brought from Paris first by Michał Twaróg of Bystrzyków (c. 1450 – 1520). Twaróg had studied at Paris in 1473–77, in the period when, following the anathematization of the Nominalists (1473), the Scotist school was there enjoying its greatest triumphs. A prominent student of Twaróg's, Jan of Stobnica (c. 1470 – 1519), was already a moderate Scotist who took account of the theories of the Ockhamists, Thomists and Humanists.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 7. When Nominalism was revived in western Europe at the turn of the sixteenth century, particularly thanks to Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples (Faber Stapulensis), it presently reappeared in Kraków and began taking the upper hand there once more over Thomism and Scotism. It was reintroduced particularly by Lefèvre's pupil, Jan Szylling, a native of Kraków who had studied at Paris in the opening years of the sixteenth century. Another follower of Lefèvre's was Grzegorz of Stawiszyn, a Kraków professor who, beginning in 1510, published the Frenchman's works at Kraków. Thus Poland had made her appearance as a separate philosophical center only at the turn of the fifteenth century, at a time when the creative period of Scholastic philosophy had already passed. Throughout the fifteenth century, Poland harbored all the currents of Scholasticism. The advent of Humanism in Poland would find a Scholasticism more vigorous than in other countries. Indeed, Scholasticism would survive the 16th and 17th centuries and even part of the 18th at Kraków and Wilno Universities and at numerous Jesuit, Dominican and Franciscan colleges.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., pp. 7–8. To be sure, in the sixteenth century, with the arrival of the Renaissance, Scholasticism would enter upon a decline; but during the 17th century's Counter-reformation, and even into the early 18th century, Scholasticism would again become Poland's chief philosophy.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., pp. 7–8. Renaissance Nicolaus Copernicus Copernicus' De revolutionibus, 1543. Click on image to read book. Sebastian Petrycy's tomb effigy, Kraków Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski Goślicki's De optimo senatore Jan Jonston The spirit of Humanism, which had reached Poland by the middle of the fifteenth century, was not very \\"philosophical.\\" Rather, it lent its stimulus to linguistic studies, political thought, and scientific research. But these manifested a philosophical attitude different from that of the previous period.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 8. Empirical natural science had flourished at Kraków as early as the fifteenth century, side by side with speculative philosophy. The most perfect product of this blossoming was Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543, ). He was not only a scientist but a philosopher. According to Tatarkiewicz, he may have been the greatest—in any case, the most renowned—philosopher that Poland ever produced. He drew the inspiration for his cardinal discovery from philosophy; he had become acquainted through Marsilio Ficino with the philosophies of Plato and the Pythagoreans; and through the writings of the philosophers Cicero and Plutarch he had learned about the ancients who had declared themselves in favor of the Earth's movement.Władysław Tatarkiewicz, \\"Outline of the History of Philosophy in Poland,\\" translated from the Polish by Christopher Kasparek, The Polish Review, vol. XVIII, no. 3, 1973, p. 77. Copernicus may also have been influenced by Kraków philosophy: during his studies there, Terminist physics had been taught, with special emphasis on \\"impetus.\\" His own thinking was guided by philosophical considerations. He arrived at the heliocentric thesis (as he was to write in a youthful treatise) \\"ratione postea equidem sensu\\": it was not observation but the discovery of a logical contradiction in Ptolemy's system, that served him as a point of departure that led to the new astronomy. In his dedication to Pope Paul III, he submitted his work for judgment by \\"philosophers.\\"Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 9. In its turn, Copernicus' theory transformed man's view of the structure of the universe, and of the place held in it by the earth and by man, and thus attained a far-reaching philosophical importance. Copernicus was involved not only in natural science and natural philosophy but also—by his postulation of a quantity theory of moneyNicolaus Copernicus, memorandum on monetary policy, 1517. and of \\"Gresham's Law\\" (in the year, 1519, of Thomas Gresham's birth\\"Copernicus seems to have drawn up some notes [on the displacement of good coin from circulation by debased coin] while he was at Olsztyn in 1519. He made them the basis of a report on the matter, written in German, which he presented to the Prussian Diet held in 1522 at Grudziądz... He later drew up a revised and enlarged version of his little treatise, this time in Latin, and setting forth a general theory of money, for presentation to the Diet of 1528.\\" Angus Armitage, The World of Copernicus, 1951, p. 91.)—in the philosophy of man. In the early sixteenth century, Plato, who had become a model for philosophy in Italy, especially in Medicean Florence, was represented in Poland in some ways by Adam of Łowicz, author of Conversations about Immortality. Generally speaking, though, Poland remained Aristotelian. Sebastian Petrycy of Pilzno (1554–1626) laid stress, in the theory of knowledge, on experiment and induction; and in psychology, on feeling and will; while in politics he preached democratic ideas. Petrycy's central feature was his linking of philosophical theory with the requirements of practical national life. In 1601–18, a period when translations into modern languages were still rarities, he accomplished Polish translations of Aristotle's practical works. With Petrycy, vernacular Polish philosophical terminology began to develop not much later than did the French and German.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., pp. 9–10. Yet another Renaissance current, the new Stoicism, was represented in Poland by Jakub Górski (c. 1525 – 1585), author of a famous Dialectic (1563) and of many works in grammar, rhetoric, theology and sociology. He tended toward eclecticism, attempting to reconcile the Stoics with Aristotle.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 10. A later, purer representative of Stoicism in Poland was Adam Burski (c. 1560 – 1611), author of a Dialectica Ciceronis (1604) boldly proclaiming Stoic sensualism and empiricism and—before Francis Bacon—urging the use of inductive method. A star among the pleiade of progressive political philosophers during the Polish Renaissance was Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski (1503–72), who advocated on behalf of equality for all before the law, the accountability of monarch and government to the nation, and social assistance for the weak and disadvantaged.Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 2, p. 38. His chief work was De Republica emendanda (On Reform of the Republic, 1551–54). Another notable political thinker was Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki (1530–1607), best known in Poland and abroad for his book De optimo senatore (The Accomplished Senator, 1568). It propounded the view—which for long got the book banned in England, as subversive of monarchy—that a ruler may legitimately govern only with the sufferance of the people.Joseph Kasparek, The Constitutions of Poland and of the United States: Kinships and Genealogy, pp. 245–50. After the first decades of the 17th century, the wars, invasions and internal dissensions that beset the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, brought a decline in philosophy. If in the ensuing period there was independent philosophical thought, it was among the religious dissenters, particularly the Polish Arians,Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 11. also known variously as Antitrinitarians, Socinians, and Polish Brethren—forerunners of the British and American Socinians, Unitarians and Deists who were to figure prominently in the intellectual and political currents of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.Kasparek, The Constitutions..., pp. 218–24. The Polish dissenters created an original ethical theory radically condemning evil and violence. Centers of intellectual life such as that at Leszno hosted notable thinkers such as the Czech pedagogue, Jan Amos Komensky (Comenius), and the Pole, Jan Jonston. Jonston was tutor and physician to the Leszczyński family, a devotee of Bacon and experimental knowledge, and author of Naturae constantia, published in Amsterdam in 1632, whose geometrical method and naturalistic, almost pantheistic concept of the world may have influenced Benedict Spinoza. The Leszczyński family itself would produce an 18th-century Polish-Lithuanian king, Stanisław Leszczyński (1677–1766; reigned in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth 1704–11 and again 1733–36), \\"le philosophe bienfaisant\\" (\\"the beneficent philosopher\\")—in fact, an independent thinker whose views on culture were in advance of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's, and who was the first to introduce into Polish intellectual life on a large scale the French influences that were later to become so strong.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 11. In 1689, in an exceptional miscarriage of justice, a Polish ex-Jesuit philosopher, Kazimierz Łyszczyński, author of a manuscript treatise, De non existentia Dei (On the Non-existence of God), was accused of atheism by a priest who was his debtor, was convicted, and was executed in most brutal fashion.\\"The execution of the nobleman Lyszczynski, accused of atheism, [a] religious murder ordered by the Diet of 1689, remained an isolated case.\\" Antoni Chołoniewski, The Spirit of Polish History, translated by Jane (Addy) Arctowska, The Polish Book Importing Co., Inc., 1918, p. 38. Enlightenment Andrzej Stanisław Załuski Stanisław Konarski Jan Śniadecki Hugo Kołłątaj Jędrzej Śniadecki Stanisław Staszic Józef Kalasanty Szaniawski After a decline of a century and a half, in the mid-18th century, Polish philosophy began to revive. The hub of this movement was Warsaw. While Poland's capital then had no institution of higher learning, neither were those of Kraków, Zamość or Wilno any longer agencies of progress. The initial impetus for the revival came from religious thinkers: from members of the Piarist and other teaching orders. A leading patron of the new ideas was Bishop Andrzej Stanisław Załuski. Scholasticism, which until then had dominated Polish philosophy, was followed by the Enlightenment. Initially the major influence was Christian Wolff and, indirectly, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's elected king, August III the Saxon, and the relations between Poland and her neighbor, Saxony, heightened the German influence. Wolff's doctrine was brought to Warsaw in 1740 by the Theatine, Portalupi; from 1743, its chief Polish champion was Wawrzyniec Mitzler de Kolof (1711–78), court physician to August III.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., pp. 11–12. Under the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth's last king, Stanisław August Poniatowski (reigned 1764–95), the Polish Enlightenment was radicalized and came under French influence. The philosophical foundation of the movement ceased to be the Rationalist doctrine of Wolff and became the Sensualism of Condillac. This spirit pervaded Poland's Commission of National Education, which completed the reforms begun by the Piarist priest, Stanisław Konarski. The Commission's members were in touch with the French Encyclopedists and freethinkers, with d'Alembert and Condorcet, Condillac and Rousseau. The Commission abolished school instruction in theology, even in philosophy.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 12. This empiricist and positivist Enlightenment philosophy produced several outstanding Polish thinkers. Although active in the reign of Stanisław August Poniatowski, they published their chief works only after the loss of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's independence in 1795. The most important of these figures were Jan Śniadecki, Stanisław Staszic and Hugo Kołłątaj.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., pp. 12–13. Another adherent of this empirical Enlightenment philosophy was the minister of education under the Duchy of Warsaw and under the Congress Poland established by the Congress of Vienna, Stanisław Kostka Potocki (1755–1821). In some places, as at Krzemieniec and its Lyceum in southeastern Poland, this philosophy was to survive well into the nineteenth century. Although a belated philosophy from a western perspective, it was at the same time the philosophy of the future. This was the period between d'Alembert and Comte; and even as this variety of positivism was temporarily fading in the West, it was carrying on in Poland.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 13. At the turn of the nineteenth century, as Immanuel Kant's fame was spreading over the rest of Europe, in Poland the Enlightenment philosophy was still in full flower. Kantism found here a hostile soil. Even before Kant had been understood, he was condemned by the most respected writers of the time: by Jan Śniadecki, Staszic, Kołłątaj, Tadeusz Czacki, later by Anioł Dowgird (1776–1835). Jan Śniadecki warned against this \\"fanatical, dark and apocalyptic mind,\\" and wrote: \\"To revise Locke and Condillac, to desire a priori knowledge of things that human nature can grasp only by their consequences, is a lamentable aberration of mind.\\"Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 14. Jan Śniadecki's younger brother, however, Jędrzej Śniadecki, was the first respected Polish scholar to declare (1799) for Kant. And in applying Kantian ideas to the natural sciences, he did something new that would not be undertaken until much later by Johannes Müller, Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz and other famous scientists of the nineteenth century.Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 2, pp. 187–88. Another Polish proponent of Kantism was Józef Kalasanty Szaniawski (1764–1843), who had been a student of Kant's at Königsberg. But, having accepted the fundamental points of the critical theory of knowledge, he still hesitated between Kant's metaphysical agnosticism and the new metaphysics of Idealism. Thus this one man introduced to Poland both the antimetaphysical Kant and the post-Kantian metaphysics.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., pp. 14–15. In time, Kant's foremost Polish sympathizer would be Feliks Jaroński (1777–1827), who lectured at Kraków in 1809–18. Still, his Kantian sympathies were only partial and this half-heartedness was typical of Polish Kantism generally. In Poland there was no actual Kantian period.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 15. For a generation, between the age of the French Enlightenment and that of the Polish national metaphysic, the Scottish philosophy of common sense became the dominant outlook in Poland. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Scottish School of Common Sense held sway in most European countries—in Britain till mid-century, and nearly as long in France. But in Poland, from the first, the Scottish philosophy fused with Kantism, in this regard anticipating the West.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., pp. 15–16. The Kantian and Scottish ideas were united in typical fashion by Jędrzej Śniadecki (1768–1838). The younger brother of Jan Śniadecki, Jędrzej was an illustrious scientist, biologist and physician, and the more creative mind of the two. He had been educated at the universities of Kraków, Padua and Edinburgh and was from 1796 a professor at Wilno, where he held a chair of chemistry and pharmacy. He was a foe of metaphysics, holding that the fathoming of first causes of being was \\"impossible to fulfill and unnecessary.\\" But foe of metaphysics that he was, he was not an Empiricist—and this was his link with Kant. \\"Experiment and observation can only gather... the materials from which common sense alone can build science.\\"Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 2, p. 189. An analogous position, shunning both positivism and metaphysical speculation, affined to the Scots but linked in some features to Kantian critique, was held in the period before the November 1830 Uprising by virtually all the university professors in Poland: in Wilno, by Dowgird; in Kraków, by Józef Emanuel Jankowski (1790–1847); and in Warsaw, by Adam Ignacy Zabellewicz (1784–1831) and Krystyn Lach Szyrma (1791–1866).Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., pp. 16–17. Polish Messianism Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński Andrzej Towiański Józef Gołuchowski Adam Mickiewicz Juliusz Słowacki Józef Kremer Zygmunt Krasiński Karol Libelt Michał Wiszniewski Bronisław Trentowski August Cieszkowski In the early nineteenth century, following a generation imbued with Enlightenment ideas, Poland passed directly to a maximalist philosophical program, to absolute metaphysics, to syntheses, to great systems, to reform of the world through philosophy; and broke with Positivism, the doctrines of the Enlightenment, and the precepts of the Scottish School of Common Sense.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 17. The Polish metaphysical blossoming occurred between the November 1830 and January 1863 Uprisings, and stemmed from the spiritual aspirations of a politically humiliated people. The Poles' metaphysic, although drawing on German idealism, differed considerably from it; it was Spiritualist rather than Idealist. It was characterized by a theistic belief in a personal God, in the immortality of souls, and in the superiority of spiritual over corporeal forces. The Polish metaphysic saw the mission of philosophy not only in the search for truth, but in the reformation of life and in the salvation of mankind. It was permeated with a faith in the metaphysical import of the nation and convinced that man could fulfill his vocation only within the communion of spirits that was the nation, that nations determined the evolution of mankind, and more particularly that the Polish nation had been assigned the role of Messiah to the nations. These three traits—the founding of a metaphysic on the concept of the soul and on the concept of the nation, and the assignment to the latter of reformative- soteriological tasks—distinguished the Polish metaphysicians. Some, such as Hoene-Wroński, saw the Messiah in philosophy itself; others, such as the poet Mickiewicz, saw him in the Polish nation. Hence Hoene-Wroński, and later Mickiewicz, adopted for their doctrines the name, \\"Messianism\\". Messianism came to apply generically to Polish metaphysics of the nineteenth century, much as the term \\"Idealism\\" does to German metaphysics.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 18. In the first half of the nineteenth century there appeared in Poland a host of metaphysicians unanimous as to these basic precepts, if strikingly at variance as to details. Their only center was Paris, which hosted Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński (1778–1853). Otherwise they lived in isolation: Bronisław Trentowski (1808–69) in Germany; Józef Gołuchowski (1797–1858) in Congress Poland; August Cieszkowski (1814–94) and Karol Libelt (1807–75) in Wielkopolska (western Poland); Józef Kremer (1806–75) in Kraków. Most of them became active only after the November 1830 Uprising.Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 2, p. 229. An important role in the Messianist movement was also played by the Polish Romantic poets, Adam Mickiewicz (1798–1855), Juliusz Słowacki (1809–49) and Zygmunt Krasiński (1812–59), as well as by religious activists such as Andrzej Towiański (1799–1878). Between the philosophers and the poets, the method of reasoning, and often the results, differed. The poets desired to create a specifically Polish philosophy, the philosophers—an absolute universal philosophy. The Messianist philosophers knew contemporary European philosophy and drew from it; the poets created more of a home-grown metaphysic.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys, p. 18. The most important difference among the Messianists was that some were rationalists, others mystics. Wroński's philosophy was no less rationalist than Hegel's, while the poets voiced a mystical philosophy. The Messianists were not the only Polish philosophers active in the period between the 1830 and 1863 uprisings. Much more widely known in Poland were Catholic thinkers such as Father Piotr Semenenko (1814–86), Florian Bochwic (1779–1856) and Eleonora Ziemięcka (1819–69), Poland's first woman philosopher. The Catholic philosophy of the period was more widespread and fervent than profound or creative.Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 3, p. 173. Also active were pure Hegelians such as Tytus Szczeniowski (1808–80) and leftist Hegelians such as Edward Dembowski (1822–46).Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 24. An outstanding representative of the philosophy of Common Sense, Michał Wiszniewski (1794–1865), had studied at that Enlightenment bastion, Krzemieniec; in 1820, in France, he had attended the lectures of Victor Cousin; and in 1821, in Britain, he had met the head of the Scottish School of Common Sense at the time, Dugald Stewart.Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 3, p. 174. Active as well were precursors of Positivism such as Józef Supiński (1804–93) and Dominik Szulc (1797–1860)—links between the earlier Enlightenment age of the brothers Śniadecki and the coming age of Positivism. Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 24. Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 3, p. 175. Positivism Aleksander Świętochowski Adolf Dygasiński Julian Ochorowicz Bolesław Prus The Positivist philosophy that took form in Poland after the January 1863 Uprising was hardly identical with the philosophy of Auguste Comte. It was in fact a return to the line of Jan Śniadecki and Hugo Kołłątaj—a line that had remained unbroken even during the Messianist period—now enriched with the ideas of Comte.Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 3, p. 176. However, it belonged only partly to philosophy. It combined Comte's ideas with those of John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer, for it was interested in what was common to them all: a sober, empirical attitude to life.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 25. The Polish Positivism was a reaction against philosophical speculation, but also against romanticism in poetry and idealism in politics. It was less a scholarly movement than literary, political and social. Few original books were published, but many were translated from the philosophical literature of the West—not Comte himself, but easier writers: Hippolyte Taine, Mill, Spencer, Alexander Bain, Thomas Henry Huxley, the Germans Wilhelm Wundt and Friedrich Albert Lange, the Danish philosopher Höffding. The disastrous outcome of the January 1863 Uprising had produced a distrust of romanticism, an aversion to ideals and illusions, and turned the search for redemption toward sober thought and work directed at realistic goals. The watchword became \\"organic work\\"—a term for the campaign for economic improvement, which was regarded as a prime requisite for progress. Poles prepared for such work by studying the natural sciences and economics: they absorbed Charles Darwin's biological theories, Mill's economic theories, Henry Thomas Buckle's deterministic theory of civilization. At length they became aware of the connection between their own convictions and aims and the Positivist philosophy of Auguste Comte, and borrowed its name and watchwords.Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 3, p. 177. Piotr Chmielowski Marian Massonius This movement, which had begun still earlier in Austrian- ruled Galicia, became concentrated with time in the Russian-ruled Congress Poland centered about Warsaw and is therefore commonly known as the \\"Warsaw Positivism.\\"Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., pp. 25–26. Its chief venue was the Warsaw Przegląd Tygodniowy (Weekly Review); Warsaw University (the \\"Main School\\") had been closed by the Russians in 1869. The pioneers of the Warsaw Positivism were natural scientists and physicians rather than philosophers, and still more so journalists and men of letters: Aleksander Świętochowski (1849–1938), Piotr Chmielowski (1848–1904), Adolf Dygasiński (1839–1902),Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 3, p. 177. Bolesław Prus (1847–1912). Prus developed an original Utilitarian-inspired ethical system in his book, The Most General Life Ideals;Edward Pieścikowski, Bolesław Prus, pp. 138–39. his 1873 public lecture \\"On Discoveries and Inventions\\", subsequently printed as a pamphlet, is a remarkably prescient contribution to what would, in the following century, become the field of logology (\\"the science of science\\"). Adam Mahrburg The movement's leader was Prus' friend, Julian Ochorowicz (1850–1917), a trained philosopher with a doctorate from the University of Leipzig. In 1872 he wrote: \\"We shall call a Positivist, anyone who bases assertions on verifiable evidence; who does not express himself categorically about doubtful things, and does not speak at all about those that are inaccessible.\\" The Warsaw Positivists—who included faithful Catholics such as Father Franciszek Krupiński (1836–98)—formed a common front against Messianism together with the Neo-Kantians. The Polish Kantians were rather loosely associated with Kant and belonged to the Positivist movement. They included Władysław Mieczysław Kozłowski (1858–1935), Piotr Chmielowski (1848–1904) and Marian Massonius (1862–1945).Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 3, pp. 177–78. Stefan Pawlicki The most brilliant philosophical mind in this period was Adam Mahrburg (1855–1913). He was a Positivist in his understanding of philosophy as a discipline and in his uncompromising ferreting out of speculation, and a Kantian in his interpretation of mind and in his centering of philosophy upon the theory of knowledge.Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 3, pp. 177–78. In Kraków, Father Stefan Pawlicki (1839–1916), professor of philosophy at the University of Kraków, was a man of broad culture and philosophical bent, but lacked talent for writing or teaching. Under his thirty-plus-year tenure, Kraków philosophy became mainly a historical discipline, alien to what was happening in the West and in Warsaw.Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 3, p. 175. 20th century Wincenty Lutosławski Even before Poland regained independence at the end of World War I, her intellectual life continued to develop. This was the case particularly in Russian-ruled Warsaw, where in lieu of underground lectures and secret scholarly organizations a Wolna Wszechnica Polska (Free Polish University) was created in 1905 and the tireless Władysław Weryho (1868–1916) had in 1898 founded Poland's first philosophical journal, Przegląd Filozoficzny (The Philosophical Review), and in 1904 a Philosophical Society.Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 3, p. 356. In 1907 Weryho founded a Psychological Society, and subsequently Psychological and Philosophical Institutes. About 1910 the small number of professionally trained philosophers increased sharply, as individuals returned who had been inspired by Mahrburg's underground lectures to study philosophy in Austrian- ruled Lwów and Kraków or abroad. Kazimierz Twardowski Edward Abramowski Kraków as well, especially after 1910, saw a quickening of the philosophical movement, particularly at the Polish Academy of Learning, where at the prompting of Władysław Heinrich there came into being in 1911 a Committee for the History of Polish Philosophy and there was an immense growth in the number of philosophical papers and publications, no longer only of a historical character.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 27. At Lwów, Kazimierz Twardowski (1866–1938) from 1895 stimulated a lively philosophical movement, in 1904 founded the Polish Philosophical Society,\\"Twardowski, Kazimierz,\\" Encyklopedia powszechna PWN, vol. 4, p. 512. and in 1911 began publication of Ruch Filozoficzny (The Philosophical Movement). There was growing interest in western philosophical currents, and much discussion of Pragmatism and Bergsonism, psychoanalysis, Henri Poincaré's Conventionalism, Edmund Husserl's Phenomenology, the Marburg School, and the social-science methodologies of Wilhelm Dilthey and Heinrich Rickert. At the same time, original ideas developed on Polish soil. Leon Petrażycki Stanisław Brzozowski Roman Ingarden, by Witkiewicz Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz Florian Znaniecki Those who distinguished themselves in Polish philosophy in these pre-World War I years of the twentieth century, formed two groups. One group developed apart from institutions of higher learning and learned societies, and appealed less to trained philosophers than to broader circles, which it (if but briefly) captured. It constituted a reaction against the preceding period of Positivism, and included Stanisław Brzozowski (1878–1911), Wincenty Lutosławski (1863–1954) and, to a degree, Edward Abramowski (1868–1918).Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., pp. 27–28. Władysław Witwicki The second group of philosophers who started off Polish philosophy in the twentieth century had an academic character. They included Władysław Heinrich (1869–1957) in Kraków, Kazimierz Twardowski (1866–1938) in Lwów, and Leon Petrażycki (1867–1931) abroad—all three, active members of the Polish Academy of Learning. Despite the considerable differences among them, they shared some basic features: all three were empiricists concerned not with metaphysics but with the foundations of philosophy; they were interested in philosophy itself, not merely its history; they understood philosophy in positive terms, but none of them was a Positivist in the old style.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., pp. 29–30. Following the restoration of Poland's independence in 1918, the two older universities (Kraków University, Lwów University) were joined by four new ones (Warsaw University, Poznań University, Wilno University, Lublin University). New philosophical journals appeared; all the university cities formed philosophical associations; conventions of Polish philosophers were held; philosophy became more professional, academic, scholarly.Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 3, pp. 363–64. Jan Łukasiewicz Stanisław Leśniewski Alfred Tarski Władysław Tatarkiewicz Tadeusz Kotarbiński A characteristic of the interbellum was that maximalist, metaphysical currents began to fade away.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 30. The dominant ambition in philosophical theory now was not breadth but precision. This was a period of specialization, consistent with the conviction that general philosophy would not yield precise results such as could be obtained in logic, psychology or the history of philosophy.Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 3, p. 366. Konstanty Michalski A few individuals did develop a general philosophical outlook: notably, Tadeusz Kotarbiński (1886–1981), Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz (1885–1939), and Roman Ingarden (1893–1970).Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., pp. 30–31. Otherwise, however, specialization was the rule. The Kraków school, true to tradition, showed an eminently historical character and produced a medievalist of world renown, Father Konstanty Michalski (1879–1947).Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 31. The Lwów school concentrated on the analysis of concepts; and in doing so, it considered both their aspects, the subjective and objective—hence, the psychological and the logical. Twardowski himself continued working at the border of psychology and logic; his pupils, however, generally split in their interests, specializing in either psychology or logic. The analytical program that Twardowski passed on to his pupils, and which they in turn spread throughout Poland, was affined to that of Franz Brentano's school (Twardowski's alma mater) in Austria and to that of the British analytic school, which likewise had arisen as a reaction against speculative systems.Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 3, p. 368. The alumni of the Lwów school entered three distinct fields. Some devoted themselves to psychology: Stefan Błachowski (1889–1962), professor at Poznań, entirely; Władysław Witwicki (1878–1948), professor at Warsaw, partly. Others pursued the theory of knowledge: they included Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz (1890–1963), professor at Lwów, and after World War II at Poznań, whose views resembled Neopositivism and who developed an original theory of radical Conventionalism. The third group worked in mathematical, or symbolic, logic. The most important center for mathematical logic was Warsaw. The Warsaw school of logic was headed by Jan Łukasiewicz (1878–1956) and Stanisław Leśniewski (1886–1939), professors at Warsaw University. The first of their pupils to achieve eminence, even before World War II, was Alfred Tarski (1902–83), from 1939 in the United States, where he became a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Another pupil of Łukasiewicz, Bolesław Sobociński (28 June 1906 – 31 October 1980), became a professor of philosophy at the University of Notre Dame. The Warsaw logic gained a worldwide importance similar to that of the Kraków medievalism. Warsaw was not, however, the sole Polish venue for logic studies. They were initiated at Kraków by Jan Śleszyński (aka Ivan Śleszyński, aka Ivan Vladislavovich Sleshinsky, 1854–1931), professor of mathematics and logic. At Kraków also, and later at Lwów, logic studies were conducted by Leon Chwistek (1884–1944), a multi- faceted and somewhat eccentric thinker—mathematician, philosopher, esthetician, painter—whose name came to be associated popularly with his concept of \\"plural realities.\\"Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 3, p. 367. Leszek Kołakowski After Petrażycki's death, the outstanding legal philosopher was Czesław Znamierowski (1888–1967), professor of philosophy at Poznań.Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 3, pp. 367–68. Another leading thinker of the period, active on the borderlines of sociology and philosophy, in both Poland and the United States, was Florian Znaniecki (1882–1958).Tatarkiewicz, Historia filozofii, vol. 3, p. 361. In the interbellum, the philosopher members of the Polish Academy of Learning included Władysław Heinrich (1869–1957; Kraków), Kazimierz Twardowski (1866–1938; Lwów), Leon Petrażycki (1867–1931; Warsaw), and, from the following generation: Konstanty Michalski (1879–1947), Jan Łukasiewicz (1878–1956), and Władysław Tatarkiewicz (1886–1980). Michalski's historical works revolutionized prevailing views on via moderna in late medieval philosophy. Łukasiewicz gained world fame with his concept of many-valued logic and is known for his \\"Polish notation.\\" Tatarkiewicz was the first to prepare in Polish a large-scale comprehensive history of western philosophy and a History of Aesthetics and worked at systematizing the concepts of aesthetics and ethics.Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., pp. 31–32. After World War II, Roman Ingarden (1893–1970), Tadeusz Kotarbiński (1886–1981), and Alfred Tarski became members of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Jan Woleński For some four decades following World War II, in Poland, a disproportionately prominent official role was given to Marxist philosophy. This, and contemporaneous sociopolitical currents, stimulated Leszek Kołakowski (1927–2009), writing in exile, to publish influential critiques of Marxist theory and communist practice. Kołakowski also wrote a remarkable history of Positivist Philosophy from Hume to the Vienna Circle.Leszek Kołakowski, Positivist Philosophy from Hume to the Vienna Circle, Penguin Books, 1972, ASIN B000OIXO7E. Similarly notable for his critiques of Soviet Marxism was Józef Maria Bocheński (1902–95), O.P., a Catholic philosopher of the Dominican Order who lectured in Rome at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas (the Angelicum) and at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. Bocheński also gained renown for his work in logic and ethics. Other Polish philosophers of the postwar period included Andrzej Zabłudowski (1938–2008), a logician and analytic philosopher of world influence, especially in the theory of induction, working at Warsaw University except for a three-decade hiatus beginning in 1968; Marek Siemek (1942–2011), a historian of German transcendental philosophy and recipient of an honorary doctorate from Bonn University; and Jan Woleński (born 1940), a broadly erudite thinker at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, specializing in the history of the Lwów-Warsaw school and in analytic philosophy and widely recognized in Poland as an atheist and exponent of replacing religion classes in Polish schools with philosophy classes.

(, , ). #There is no need for repentance. () Nehor's style of evangelizing was confrontational and led to violence. He began arguing with a man named Gideon, who was a member of the Church of God. During the exchange, Nehor became angry and killed Gideon with a sword (). Nehor was then taken to face murder charges before Alma the Younger, High Priest of the 'Church of God', but also Chief Judge of the land. Alma condemns Nehor to death for the murder of Gideon and accuses him of priestcraft (). Before his execution, Nehor was taken to the top of hill Manti and \\"caused\\" to recant his teachings before suffering an \\"ignominious death\\" ().

A photo from the shoot showing the three band members and the girl was used as cover art for the back side of the single. As the band was in the middle of a hectic promotion schedule, and was unable to spend the necessary weeks standing still to shoot the video, the members each allowed a plaster life mask to be made from their faces, from which latex imitations of the band members' faces were cast. With the masks fitted onto mannequins, Chamberlain was able to use painstakingly slow stop motion special effects. Only a few brief scenes at the beginning and end of the video show the real band members. B-sides, bonus tracks and remixes The single b-side is an original medley called \\"I Believe/All I Need To Know\\". There are 7 official mixes of \\"All She Wants Is\\". They are often credited with different names on different releases. The remixes were all done by Shep Pettibone. * \\"All She Wants Is\\" (Album Version) - 4:33 * \\"All She Wants Is\\" (45 Mix) / (7\\" Version) - 4:32 * \\"All She Wants Is\\" (US Master Mix) - 7:19 * \\"All She Wants Is\\" (US Master Dub) / (Latino Dub) - 6:45 * \\"All She Wants Is\\" (Euro House Mix) / (Euro Dub Mix) - 7:33 * \\"All She Wants Is\\" (Euro House Dub I) / (Euro House Dub) / (House Dub) - 7:07 * \\"All She Wants Is\\" (Euro House Dub II) - 5:43  Formats and track listing   7\\": EMI. / DD 11 United Kingdom  # \\"All She Wants Is\\" (45 Mix) – 4:36 # \\"I Believe/All I Need to Know\\" (Medley) – 5:04  12\\": EMI. / 12 DD 11 United Kingdom  # \\"All She Wants Is (Euro Dub Mix)\\" – 7:34 (a.k.a. \\"Euro House Mix\\") # \\"All She Wants Is (45 Mix)\\" – 4:36 # \\"I Believe/All I Need to Know\\" (Medley) – 5:04  12\\": EMI. / 12 DDX 11 United Kingdom  # \\"All She Wants Is (US Master Mix)\\" – 7:19 # \\"All She Wants Is (45 Mix)\\" – 4:36 # \\"I Believe/All I Need to Know (Medley)\\" – 5:04  12\\": EMI. / 12 DD-DJ11 (Promo) United Kingdom  # \\"All She Wants Is\\" (Euro House Mix) – 7:34 (a.k.a. \\"Euro Dub Mix\\") # \\"All She Wants Is\\" (45 Mix) – 4:36 # \\"All She Wants Is\\" (US Master Mix) – 7:19 # \\"All She Wants Is\\" (House Dub) - 7:08 (a.k.a. \\"Euro House Dub\\", \\"Euro House Dub I\\")  7\\": Capitol Records. / B-44287 United States  # \\"All She Wants Is\\" (45 Mix) – 4:36 # \\"I Believe/All I Need to Know\\" (Medley) – 5:04 * Also available on MC in the US (Capitol / 4BX-44287)  12\\": Capitol Records. / V-15434 United States # \\"All She Wants Is\\" (US Master Mix) – 7:16 # \\"All She Wants Is\\" (Euro House Mix) – 7:32 (a.k.a. \\"Euro Dub Mix\\") # \\"All She Wants Is\\" (45 Mix) – 4:34 # \\"I Believe/All I Need to Know\\" (Medley) – 5:04  12\\": Capitol Records. / SPRO-79483 (Promo) United States # \\"All She Wants Is (US Master Mix)\\" – 7:16 # \\"All She Wants Is (US Masterdub)\\" – 6:43 (a.k.a. \\"Latino Dub\\") # \\"All She Wants Is (Euro House Mix)\\" – 7:32 (a.k.a. \\"Euro Dub Mix\\") # \\"All She Wants Is (Euro House Dub I)\\" – 7:07 (a.k.a. \\"House Dub', \\"Euro House Dub\\") # \\"All She Wants Is (Euro House Dub II)\\" – 5:43  12\\": EMI / K 060 20 32366 Netherlands  # \\"All She Wants Is\\" (House Dub) – 7:07 (a.k.a. \\"Euro House Dub\\", \\"Euro House Dub I\\") # \\"All She Wants Is\\" (Latino Dub) – 6:44 (a.k.a. \\"US Masterdub\\") # \\"All She Wants Is\\" (7\\" Version) – 4:31 * Also released on German CD (EMI-Electrola / CDP 560-20-3236-2)  CD: EMI / CD DD 11 (United Kingdom) # \\"All She Wants Is\\" (45 Mix) – 4:36 # \\"Skin Trade\\" (Parisian Mix) – 8:10 # \\"I Believe/All I Need to Know\\" (Medley) – 5:09 * Also available on 3\\" CD in the US (Capitol / C3-44287-2)  CD: Toshiba-EMI / XP12-5006 (Japan) # \\"All She Wants Is\\" (45 Mix) – 4:36 # \\"All She Wants Is\\" (Euro Dub Mix) – 7:34 (a.k.a. \\"Euro House Mix\\") # \\"I Believe/All I Need to Know\\" (Medley) – 5:09 * 3\\" CD reworking of the first UK 12\\"  CD: Part of \\"Singles Box Set 1986-1995\\" boxset  # \\"All She Wants Is\\" (45 Mix) – 4:36 # \\"I Believe/All I Need to Know\\" (Medley) – 5:04 # \\"All She Wants Is (US Master Mix)\\" – 7:16 # \\"All She Wants Is\\" (Euro Dub Mix) – 7:34 (a.k.a. \\"Euro House Mix\\") # \\"Skin Trade\\" (Parisian Mix) – 8:10 Covers, samples, & media references \\"All She Wants Is\\" can be heard as background music playing in a bar in the 2003 film Monster. \\"All She Wants Is\\" was used in season 5, episode 5 of Cold Case in 2007.

Run by the Sisters of Mercy, it was located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland. The school was established in 1969 and was named for the Sisters' founder, Catherine McAuley. Catherine McAuley High School was the successor school of two other all-women's Mercy schools, Saint Joseph's Academy (1881–1969) and Cathedral High School (1909–1969). In July 2016, the school building was transferred to The Maine Girls' Academy. In July 2018, The Maine Girls' Academy announced that it would not reopen for the following school year.  Campus  Catherine McAuley in 2009 Located in Portland's Deering Center neighborhood, McAuley's classrooms and offices were housed in the main building, the gymnasium, and the Academy. The main building and gym, designed by Portland architect Wilbur R. Ingalls, Jr., were connected by the glass-enclosed \\"mall,\\" which acts as both atrium and cafeteria. The former St. Joseph's Academy building housed the Advancement Office as well as Latin, Spanish, history, art, and some of the math and religious studies classrooms. In 2005, the Sisters of Mercy donated land to the school so that the students could have several new athletic fields. The land once held shrines to saints, stations of the cross, and a grotto to the Blessed Virgin Mother Mary. McAuley High added a wireless network in 2006.  Academics  Catherine McAuley offered an honors track as well as six AP courses. Students completed yearly service requirements in order to graduate. In addition to their service requirement, seniors completed a service project in May prior to graduation.  Extra-curricular activities and athletics Athletics The school offered Class-A cross country, field hockey, soccer, basketball, cheering, indoor track, swimming, lacrosse, softball, tennis, and track and field.

These sensors measure the electrical potential of an electrode when no current is present. Principle The signal is measured as the potential difference (voltage) between the working electrode and the reference electrode. The working electrode's potential must depend on the concentration of the analyte in the gas or solution phase. The reference electrode is needed to provide a defined reference potential. Classification of sensors Potentiometric solid state gas sensors have been generally classified into three broad groups. *Type I sensors have an electrolyte containing mobile ions of the chemical species in the gas phase that it is monitoring. The commercial product, YSZ oxygen sensor, is an example of type I. *Type II sensors do not have mobile ions of the chemical species to be sensed, but an ion related to the target gas can diffuse in the solid electrolyte to allow equilibration with the atmosphere. Therefore, type I and type II sensors have the same design with gas electrodes combined with metal and an electrolyte where oxidized or reduced ions can be electrochemically equilibrated through the electrochemical cell. In the third type of electrochemical sensor, auxiliary phases are added to the electrodes to enhance the selectivity and stability. *Type III sensors make the electrode concept even more confusing. With respect to the design of a solid state sensor, the auxiliary phase looks as part of the electrode. But it cannot be an electrode because auxiliary phase materials are not generally good electrical conductor. In spite of this confusion, type III design offers more feasibility in terms of designing various sensors with different auxiliary materials and electrolytes.

It has an immunostimulatory effect. Formation Two enzymes are needed to release tuftsin from immunoglobulin G.Victor, A. N. Tuftsin, a natural activator of phagocyte cells: an overview. Ann. New York Acad. Sci. 1–11 (1983) First, the spleen enzyme tuftsin-endocarboxypeptidase nicks the heavy chain at the Arg- Glu bond (292-293). The arginine carboxy-terminal is now susceptible to the action of the second enzyme, carboxypeptidase β. The leukokinin-S so nicked is present in tissues and blood, free or bound to outer membrane of the appropriate phagocyte. The membrane enzyme leukokininase acts on the bound leukokinin-S to cleave it at the amino end of threonine between residues 288 and 289 (-Lys-Thr-). Free tuftsin is biologically active. The phagocytic cell plays a unique role in releasing its own activator. Leukokininase can be found on the outer membrane of phagocytic cells: blood neutrophil leukocytes of human and dog, rabbit peritoneal granulocyte. It is a highly active enzyme with pH optimum:6.8.Fridkin, M. & Victor A., N. Tuftsin: it’s chemistry, biology and clinical potential. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 24, 1–40 (1989) Function Phagocytosis Half-maximum stimulation is attained at about 100 nM. Stimulation of phagocytosis is obtained with polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) cells from human, dog, rabbit and cow as well as with macrophages from the lung and peritoneal cavity of mice, and guinea pig and mouse bone marrow cells. This effect is inhibited by peptide analogue Thr-Lys- Pro-Pro-Arg. Basal activity is not inhibited, so basal phagocytosis may follow a different pathway from that which follows stimulation. Stimulation of pinocytosis is exerted only on phagocytic cells, not on cultured cell line mouse leukemia. Motility and chemotaxis The vertical motility of neutrophils in capillary tubes is stimulated by tuftsin, stimulation is inhibited by Thr-Lys-Pro-Pro-Arg. The tuftsin analogue Thr-Pro-Lys-Arg failed to show stimulation. Formation of reactive oxygen compounds Tuftsin augments the formation of O2− and H2O2 to a considerable extent without the need for particle phagocytosis. Experiments showed rapid response to various concentrations of tuftsin. The optimum concentration was at 375 nM. This response to tuftsin stimulation of macrophage accounts for about 90% of the superoxide formed through the xanthine oxidase system. Augmentation of Tumor Necrosis Factor Injection of tuftsin intraperitoneally increases the formulation of TNF in serum and supernatants of cultured splenic and peritoneal adherent cells. This was also demonstrated in vitro using HL60 leukemia cells. Immunmodulating activity Tuftsin acts at the level of antigen processing. Antigen uptake by T-lymphocytes is enhanced when a given antigen is processed in the presence of tuftsin. Maximal effect was measured at tuftsin concentration 5 x 10−8 M. This process is highly specific and dependent on the structural integrity of tuftsin. Tuftsin-antigen complexes are very immunogenic. The number of antigen-forming cells increases following injections of tuftsin T-dependent antigen. Tuftsin enhances the antigen- dependent cell-mediated immunity. Spleen cell cytotoxicity is augmented to a significant degree. Effect of cell cytotoxicity The enhancement of antitumour immune response by immunomodulators is capable of stimulating reticuloendothelial and T-cell-mediated tumour destruction. The effect of tuftsin on augmentation of cellular cytotoxicity was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Nontoxicity for animals and humans In different animal models, tuftsin showed no toxicity when administrated intravenously or intraperitoneally. In a phase I study, tuftsin was shown to be nontoxic in adult human patients with advanced cancer when it was injected once intravenously (0.96 mg/kg body weight). Extensive augmentation of white blood counts and enhanced cytotoxicity of lymphocytes was notable. No detectable tuftsin-related toxicity was noticed in human patients during a phase II study, where the peptide was injected intravenously twice a week at total doses of 5 mg per injection. Pathology Tuftsin deficiency can be hereditary or can occur following splenectomy, resulting in increased susceptibility to certain diseases e.g.: infected eczematous dermatitis with draining lymph nodes, otitis and sinusitis. Acquired tuftsin deficiency can occur in granulocyte leukemia, when blood neutrophils failed to show stimulation with synthetic tuftsin or with the serum leukokinin. Serum level of tuftsin was minimal or absent. Clinical significance Poly- or oligotuftsin derivatives can be used as delivery systems. For example, a 35-40 unit repeat was used as a carrier for the preparation of synthetic immunogens in malaria vaccines against Plasmodium falciparum.Siemion, I. Z. & Kluczyk, A. Tuftsin: On the 30-year anniversary of Victor Najjar’s discovery. Peptides 20, 645–674 (1999) Tuftsin enhances the action of rifampicin-bearing liposomes in the treatment of tuberculosis, and that amphotericin B-bearing liposomes in the treatment of human aspergillosis in mice. Conjugates with polytuftsin retain tuftsin-like effects and increase the epitope specific antibody production.Gábor, M. et al. Synthesis, Conformation, and Immunoreactivity of New Carrier Molecules Based on Repeated Tuftsin-Like Sequence. Biopolymers 73, 000–000 (2004) Tuftsin analogues Tuftsin sequence appears in all four classes of IgG. However, only leukokinin, a small fraction of IgG1, displays tuftsin activity. Tuftsin occurs in guinea pig IgG2 exactly in the same position. The mouse IgG1 analogue is a tetrapeptide Thr-Gln-Pro-Arg at the same place, one base change at the first base of the triplet code. Tuftsin sequence appears in residues 9-12 from the amino terminal of p12 protein of Rauscher murine leukemia virus. The tetrapeptide Thr-Arg-Pro-Lys is in the influenza hemagglutinin virus protein, residues 214–217. The canine analogue is tetrapeptide: Thr-Lys-Pro-Lys. The peptide Thr-Arg-Pro-Arg is biologically active pancreatic polypeptide 32–35 with gastrointestinal functions. Thr-Arg- Pro-Arg, Thr-Lys-Pro-Lys, Thr-Arg-Pro-Lys are as active as Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg. Thr-Lys-Pro-Pro-Arg is a potent inhibitor. Lys-Pro-Pro-Arg is also an inhibitor of phagocytosis, superoxide anion production and chemotaxis both human and rat PMN leukocytes and monocytes. Tyr-Lys-Pro exert considerable regulatory effect on several macrophage functions including: phagocytosis, cell locomotion, superoxide anion production, IgE-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, β-glycuronidase release, and IL-1 production.

Their lease began in March 2000, the same month Citigroup leased 25 Canada Square. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter sublet the building to Tube Lines. They share the building leading to the video wall, built for use in stock trading but used as a Recovery Silver Control for the London Underground in the aftermath of the 7 July 2005 London bombings. In 2013 Morgan Stanley vacated the building and it was taken over by London Underground, who had taken over Tube Lines. London Underground vacated the building in 2017. 15 Westferry Circus serves as the fifteen mile (24 km) marker in the London Marathon. The ownership of this building was the subject of a protracted legal dispute in Ireland in 2012. As of 2018, Morgan Stanley is once again occupying two floors of the building, with another floor sublet to a tenant.

It examines the human relationship with food by showing breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Plot Breakfast A man enters a room, sits down, and brushes the previous diner's leftovers onto the floor. Across from him sits another man with a placard attached to a chain hanging around his neck. The diner stands up and reads the placard one line at a time and follows the instructions. He puts money down the man's throat and pokes him in the eye. The man's shirt unbuttons itself, and a dumbwaiter rises up into where the man's chest should be. The diner takes his food, and punches the man in the chin with his third knuckle for his utensils. When he is done eating, he kicks the man's shin for a napkin. After wiping off his mouth, the diner convulses, and then goes limp. The man now comes to life, stretches, and places the placard on the former diner. He stands and puts another tally mark on the wall. Another diner comes in and the scenario is repeated with him. At the end, we see a line stretching down the hall and around the corner. Lunch Two diners, a business man and a vagabond, are unable to get the waiter's attention. They proceed to eat everything in sight: the flowers, their shoes, pants, shirt, underwear, plates, tablecloth, table, and chairs, now leaving both nude behind, The vagabond watches the business man and then eats what he eats. All the while they are eating whatever is on or around them, they try to get the waiter's attention whenever he passes by, but to no avail. In the end with everything else eaten, the business man eats his utensils. The vagabond also eats his. The business man then smiles, pulls his utensils from his mouth, and advances on the vagabond, who recoils in horror. Dinner In a luxurious restaurant, a wealthy gourmet sits at a table adding many sauces and spices to his dish, which is hidden by the sheer number of condiments. This continues for a long time, and then he hammers a fork to his wooden left hand. He then starts to eat his own hand. In a series of short and violent scenes, we are then shown an athlete eating his lower leg, a woman eating her breasts, and the last eater, who is about to eat his genitals. As he realises the presence of the camera, the man covers his genitals and shoos the camera away with his hand. Reception A New York Times review called the film \\"caustically witty but slight.\\" It goes on to say that \\"Švankmajer conceived the film in the 1970s, when it seemed too risky a political allegory to be made [...] it now seems too simple a statement about how people are devoured by mechanistic states and each other.\\" Michael Nottingham pointed out that \\"the humour is particularly black in [the last] segment, mocking how delicate social ritual and conditioning are effective masks for brutal self- destruction.\\" Cast *Ludvík Šváb as Eater #1 *Bedrřch Glaser as Eater #2 *Jan Kraus as Eater #3 *Pavel Marek as Eater *Josef Fiala as Eater #4 *Karel Hamr as Eater #5 References External links  1992 films Czechoslovak animated films Czechoslovak films Films directed by Jan Švankmajer Films with live action and animation Czechoslovak animated short films Czech films Czech animated films Surrealist films 1990s stop- motion animated films Pixilation films 1992 animated films ","title":"Food (film)"},{"id":"6459997","text":"A homewrecker is a person, object, or activity that causes the breakup of a marriage or similar relationship.

Born in Tottenham, north London, Trevillion, produced artwork for publications like Eagle while still at school. From the 1960s to the 1980s, Trevillion devised and illustrated pieces for Daily Mirror, Daily Express, The Sun, The Daily Telegraph, The Times, and TV Century 21 and in 2006 revived his cult football cartoon You Are The Ref - made famous by football magazine Shoot! in the 1970s - for The Observer. A book collecting 50 years of You Are The Ref was published in October 2006. From August 2008, You Are The Ref appeared online at guardian.co.uk. Trevillion, who spent much of the 1960s in the US working with Mark McCormack at IMG for some of the world's biggest brands, is the author and illustrator of over 20 books which have sold worldwide. He also illustrated the famous Gary Player Golf Class which appeared in over 300 newspapers worldwide. He has met and drawn some of sport's biggest names, including Pelé, Bobby Moore, George Best, Franz Beckenbauer, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, Sugar Ray Robinson and Oscar De La Hoya. As a young man, he also met and drew British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Trevillion's career away from his art has been rich and, at times, bizarre. He worked as a stand-up comedian, supporting the likes of Norman Wisdom and Bob Monkhouse, had a record deal, was crowned world speed-kissing champion, and invented a split-handed golf putting technique. He was also the inspiration behind an attempt to boost Leeds United's image in the 1970s. Hired by Don Revie in 1972, his ideas included wearing numbered sock tags (which were subsequently thrown into the crowd as souvenirs) and synchronised warm-ups. In 2008 Trevillion was interviewed in the award-winning documentary Roy, about the life and times of Roy of the Rovers: a character Trevillion illustrated in the 1950s. The film was shown at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. In 2011 Trevillion was short-listed for the prestigious Sports Journalists' Association Cartoonist of the Year Award. Marking this feat at the age of 75, his long-time colleague Norman Giller commented in a tribute on the SJA website: \\"To describe Paul as a cartoonist is to trivialize a career dedicated to producing outstanding art.\\"  Books  References External links *You Are The Ref website *BBC Gallery of Paul Trevillion 1934 births Living people People from Tottenham English comics artists ","title":"Paul Trevillion"},{"id":"6460015","text":"The Dobi-I was designed by Lithuanian aviator Jurgis Dobkevičius and the first airplane of Lithuanian design.

The blue banner reads \\"Say 'I Do' to Marriage Equality\\". Unitarian Universalism and the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) have a long-standing tradition of welcoming LGBT people. History The first ordained minister of a major religious group in the U.S. or Canada to come out as gay was UU Minister James Stoll in 1969.\\"My Greatly Human Hometown Minister--James Lewis Stoll, 1936-1994\\" There have been several UUA resolutions supporting people regardless of sexual orientation since 1970. Unitarian Universalism was the first denomination to accept openly transgender people as full members with eligibility to become clergy; in 1988 the first openly transgender person was ordained by the Unitarian Universalist Association.http://www.uua.org/lgbtq/history/185789.shtmlOffice of Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Concerns The UUA has had a popular program for a church wanting to become a \\"Welcoming Congregation\\" for LGBT people since 1989.

In 2004 UU Minister Rev. Debra Haffner of The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing published An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective.Religious Leaders Must Support Justice for All  Reproductive Health  RHRealityCheck.org Instituted organizations The UUA maintains an office called Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Ministries (LGBTQ Ministries), which operates the Welcoming Congregation program. Established in 1973 with several name changes over the years, it was the first major national religious organization to welcome everyone for LGBT inclusion. Any UU church desiring to become a Welcoming Congregation must meet the requirements set out in The Welcoming Congregation Handbook by LGBTQ Ministries. Once the requirements have been met, the UUA designates that church as a Welcoming Congregation and adds an icon to the listing in the UUA Directory. Interweave From 1993 until 2016, there was a fellowship of LGBT Unitarian Universalists and supporters called Interweave Continental. Interweave was a related organization of the UUA, actively working to end oppression based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Sometimes, the Welcoming Committee evolved into an Interweave Chapter. Each chapter requests financial and advocacy support from the fellowship with which it is connected. Canadian The Canadian Unitarian Council (CUC) similarly operates a Gender and Sexual Diversity Monitoring Group,Gender and Sexual Diversity and like the UUA (of which it became autonomous in 2002), has Welcoming Congregations.CUC pamphlet on their Welcoming Congregation program The Canadian Unitarian Universalist congregations perform same-sex marriages and the CUC supports this work through its Lay Chaplaincy program.CUC pamphlet on their Lay Chaplaincy program The first same-sex marriage performed by a church in Canada (after 1972 a civil same-sex marriage for Michel Girouard and Rejean Tremblay of Montreal) was that of Chris Vogel and Richard North, married by the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Winnipeg on February 11, 1974 officiated by Unitarian Minister Rev. Norm Naylor. The Unitarian Universalist Church was responsible for the first same-sex marriages performed in Manitoba, Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, and Saskatchewan, mostly in the 1970s, although the provincial governments often refused to recognize the marriages at the time. Welcoming Congregation A Welcoming CongregationWelcoming Congregation is a church in the Unitarian Universalist Association or Canadian Unitarian Council that has undergone an intensive educational program to help the congregation become more inclusive of lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender (LGBT) people.

It was formed by the then Northern Branch of the Irish Rugby Football Union in October 1890.Belfast Evening Telegraph, 22 October 1890 It has traditionally being ranked second in importance to the Ulster Senior Cup. It has declined in importance due to the formation of the All- Ireland League and growth in importance of the Heineken Cup. The Senior League has had a chequered history. Its value was marred in the amateur era by periods when the elite clubs like North, Instonians and Collegians withdrew from the league to allow them to fulfil more friendly fixtures - particularly against English and Welsh opposition. This attitude from some of the senior clubs even lead to the scrapping of the league in 1930, and it was not re- established until after World War II. The practice of withdrawing from the league finally died out in the 1970s. Mostly the league was played in one section on an all-play-all home and away basis. However, with the expansion of the number of Senior Clubs in 1980, two sections were formed and the top two teams qualified for semi-finals. This allowed for a showpiece final at the end of the season. The two section arrangement continued until 1990 when the advent of professionalism and preparation for the All-Ireland League, saw the league separated into two sections based on playing ability. Promotion and relegation between the two sections was introduced at this time. This later gave way to a single-division league.

They are usually white or fawn, with the bulls being darker with black point. Their great similarity to the American Brahman cattle is not without basis, they are also descended from cattle from the western coast of India, only much earlier. Since 1951, the Boran Cattle Breeders' Society has been managed and strategically breeding Boran cattle in Kenya. As of 2008, there were approximately 454 beef ranches in the country, which can be classified based on ownership as one of five categories: group ranches, private company ranches, co-operative ranches, public company ranches, and government ranches.  Physical characteristics  Having been in Africa for over a thousand years, they are very well adapted to local conditions and parasites. Boran cattle are known for their fertility, early maturation (more so than other Zebu breeds), hardiness, and docility. Types The Orma Boran is the smallest of the Boran breeds, smaller than the Kenyan Boran. Mature male Orma Boran range in size from 225 to 395 kg, while females are from 250 to 355 kg. The Kenyan Boran developed from the Orma Boran, Borana, and Somali Boran. The Kenyan Boran is differentiated from other Boran due to its size and well- developed hindquarters. Mature male Kenyan Boran range in size from 550 to 850 kg, while females are from 400 to 550 kg.

Sellin studied theology and oriental languages. During 1897–1908 he taught at the Protestant faculty of theology in Vienna, during 1908–1913 at the University of Rostock, during 1913–1921 in Kiel and in 1921–1935 in Berlin.Biographical sketch @ Catalogus Professorum Rostochiensium Sellin was Old Testament scholar and a pioneer of application of archaeology into Biblical sciences. With his excavations in Ta'anakh he initiated and led one of the first excavations of a ″tell″ in Palestine/Land of Israel (there he also found cuneiform tablets from about the 15th cent. BCE, that were edited by Friedrich Hrozný); together with others he also conducted excavations in Jericho and Shechem. Sellin's description of the two places of Jericho, one being the old city mentioned in the Book of Joshua and other passages, and the other the new Roman city, allows a possible explanation of an alleged contradiction between the gospels of Mark and Luke, i.e. whether Jesus healed a blind man on the way to or after arriving in the city of Jericho (Luke 18:35 and Mark 10:46). As the two \\"Jerichos\\" were about a mile apart, one may understand that Jesus left Luke's Jericho and was arriving at Mark's Jericho when this took place. Sellin's main topic was the study of the Old Testament in historical, religio-historical and theological perspectives. Probably his most successful book was his Einleitung in das Alte Testament from 1910, which was updated and expanded by himself (until 7th. ed. 1935) and later on by others until 12th. ed. 1979 (Engl. translation: Introduction to the OT, 1923). He also tried to apply the results from archaeology to the history of ancient Israel. In his exegesis of the book of (Deutero-)Isaiah he related the suffering servant to Moses and concluded that Moses would have died as martyr by his own people. This idea in turn was taken up by Sigmund Freud.  Selected works  * Beiträge zur Israelitischen und Jüdischen Religionsgeschichte.

The instrument is played by striking or plucking the strings with fingers, sticks, pipes or even large objects such as artillery shell casings. The instrument produces a very distinctive bass tone, the sound of which is often described as 'dark' or 'sinister'. The blaster beam was designed by John Lazelle in the early 1970s, and was first widely used by Francisco Lupicavirtualvenice.info Francisco and his Cosmic Beam by Pat Hartman who built several out of iron. American child actor turned musician Craig Huxley created his own refined version of the beam out of aluminum which was brought to fame in the soundtrack for Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) in which composer Jerry Goldsmith used the instrument to create the signature V'ger sound.

Huxley also played the instrument on the Quincy Jones song, \\"Ai No Corrida\\", in addition to other Quincy Jones productions like Michael Jackson's \\"Beat It.\\" Huxley successfully patented his design of the beam in 1984. The instrument has since been used to create dark unnatural sounds in other movie soundtracks in the late 1970s and early 1980s including the films The Black Hole, Forbidden World, Dreamscape, and Meteor, in the last of which it was used during shots of the giant looming meteorite as it approached Earth. It has also been used by new age artists including Kitaro, Stearns and Huxley. The blaster beam was also used for the seismic charge sound used by Jango Fett, in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones. Some more unexpected attention came in the early nineties when several women attending a music concert in New York's Central Park claimed to have been stimulated by the sound created by a blaster beam being used in the performance. This prompted Australian radio station 2SER-FM to conduct an experiment in which they played a continuous loop of a blaster beam performance and asked their female listeners to report any stimulation they experienced.

History   First church (1856-1869)  The Hudson's Bay Company hired Robert John Staines, graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, to teach the children of Fort Victoria, and offered him a further stipend to take Holy Orders and serve as chaplain to the fort as well. He arrived at the fort with his wife Emma and servants in 1849, none too impressed with the rustic conditions at this remote trading post. For their part, the small fort community became increasingly dissatisfied with his teaching skills and manner, such that he was discharged in 1854. He in turn set off for London to grieve the Company's land policies at the Colonial Office on behalf of fellow settlers. Staines had held Anglican services in the mess room of Fort Victoria and aboard visiting ships pending completion of a church. The Company appointed Edward Cridge, a college friend of Staines, as his replacement. Cridge and his new wife Mary arrived from England on April 1, 1855, via the new Panama Canal Railway. The 1855 census of Victoria reported \\"232 non-native persons\\". The company church, designed and supervised by J D Pemberton, Colonial Surveyor, was finally ready for use on August 31, 1856 and was initially known as the Victoria District Church. Rev. George Hills was consecrated as the first Bishop of British Columbia in 1859 Beginning in 1858, Victoria was overrun with gold seekers on their way to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. Hundreds of makeshift structures went up and several years of intense growth ensued. December 12, 1859, Queen Victoria issued Royal Letters Patent creating the Bishopric of British Columbia. On January 12, 1859, Letters Patent created the Diocese of British Columbia, endowed by The Baroness Burdett-Coutts. On February 24, 1859, the Rev. George Hills was consecrated in Westminster Abbey as its first Bishop. After a summer of fundraising for the Columbia Mission Fund, Bishop Hills sailed for Victoria and arrived on January 6, 1860. Bishop Hills had engaged the clipper barque Athelstan to bring from England a pre-fabricated church building and furnishings, which arrived in February. It was erected on Block R, Douglas St., about half a mile north of Christ Church, and was consecrated as the Church of St. John the Divine, after his parish in Yarmouth. The Town of Victoria was incorporated in 1862 with 6000 people and 1500 buildings. Vancouver Island reverted from the Hudson's Bay Company to the Crown, and Fort Victoria was demolished. Hills had to choose which of the two churches to make the cathedral. St. John's could hold 600. Christ Church had been built with a capacity of 400, but an apse and south aisle were added to it in 1862 and a north aisle in 1865. On December 7, 1865, opting for the better location of Christ Church, he consecrated Christ Church Cathedral and appointed Cridge as its first dean. On the night of September 30, 1869, the cathedral burned to the ground. The communion vessels and organ were rescued and the vestry books survived. The parish used a vacant Presbyterian church for several years while they rebuilt.  Second church (1872-1929) The cornerstone for the new building was laid on May 20, 1872 by Lieutenant-Governor J.W. Trutch. It was to be another wooden structure as conditions were not ripe for a stone building. It was about by with a tower of Construction took a little over six months. = Schism of 1874 = As a low churchman, Dean Cridge had little use for church hierarchy and authority; not for obedience to his bishop, and certainly not for formal liturgies. Things simmered privately between Cridge and Hills until evensong on December 5, 1872, the day of services for the consecration of the new cathedral, when guest preacher the Venerable Wm. S. Reece, Archdeacon of Vancouver (i.e. Vancouver Island), gave what Cridge interpreted as a rousing endorsement of ritualism. Rather than announcing the following hymn, Cridge hotly took issue with the homily, in breach of canon law which prohibited public disagreement among clergy. Bishop Hills then had to take official notice of the situation, trying first censure, the most lenient course. Cridge remained defiant. The citizens and newspapers of Victoria took sides. Hills then tried Cridge in ecclesiastical court. The trial was held in the vacant Presbyterian church, was open to the public and received attentive press coverage. On September 22, 1874, Cridge was found guilty of 16 of 18 charges laid, and his licence was revoked. Cridge disregarded the revocation and demanded that the case be heard in \\"an unbiased secular court.\\" Hills then sought an injunction against Cridge in the Supreme Court of British Columbia sub nomine Bishop of Columbia v. Cridge. It fell to their mutual friend Supreme Court Chief Justice Matthew Baillie Begbie to adjudicate. He encouraged them to settle out of court. Cridge did apologise for his outburst at evensong, but would not recognise the authority of the Bishop. In his judgment of October 24, 1874, granting an injunction forbidding Cridge to act as a priest of the diocese, Chief Justice Begbie observed, > His [Bishop Hills'] reluctance to use his power may however, obviously be > imputed to motives of the most christian forbearance … But if the defendant > had been at once in December, 1872, excluded from the pulpit of Christ > Church until due submission, I should not now have had the most painful duty > of attending to this distressing case, and probably much correspondence of a > most disagreeable nature would have been avoided. Begbie had been a member of the cathedral parish and was on the building committee for the new cathedral, but after rendering this verdict, he transferred his membership to St. John the Divine. Much of the Cathedral's congregation, among them some of Victoria's major figures such as Sir James Douglas and Dr. J.S. Helmcken, met with Cridge a few days later and voted to form a new congregation, the Church of Our Lord, under the auspices of the Reformed Episcopal Church, which had recently broken from the Episcopal Church of the United States. Even so, the Columbia Mission Report was able to state that givings at Christ Church in 1875 were similar to those in 1871. Cridge's new congregation met at the vacant Presbyterian church until their building was completed at the end of 1875.  Present church (1929-present)  Charles Schofield oversaw the construction of the present church, as the Bishop of British Columbia The wooden structure built in 1872 became inadequate for the size of the congregation. In 1891, an international design competition for a larger and more enduring edifice was held. In January 1893, architect J.C.M. Keith of Victoria was announced as the winner. He designed a 13th century Gothic style building with a spire. The congregation made a good start on a building fund, but it was not adequate to begin construction. Efforts were discontinued until 1920. By then, Keith had altered his original design to include two west towers and a central lantern tower, but the latter was never built. Bishop Charles Schofield, elected in 1916, had the judgement, tact, courage, perseverance and business sense to lead the project. He had recently overseen the rebuilding of Christ Church Cathedral, Fredericton, which was ignited by lightning in 1911 during his tenure there as Dean. In 1919, a new Cathedral Buildings Campaign for $250 000 was authorized. =Construction= Schofield had Memorial Hall built first; its cornerstone was laid on October 1, 1923. A service for breaking ground on the new Cathedral took place on May 20, 1926. Fortunately, Mr. Keith was still available to supervise the project. The cornerstone was laid on September 9, 1926 by the Rt. Rev. and Rt. Hon. A.F. Winnington-Ingram, the Lord Bishop of London. Funds were just sufficient to construct the nave, narthex and the lower portions of the northwest and southwest towers only. Vaulting was of brick rather than stone, and was flattened by two feet to reduce costs. The organ from the previous building was rebuilt on top of temporary vestries in the south-east corner of the nave. The east end of the nave was closed with a temporary wooden wall, and this much was consecrated on September 28, 1929. Winston Churchill visited the site several weeks earlier, on September 9, 1929, and was quick to help when the superintendent asked him to lay a stone on the north tower. In September 1929, Winston Churchill laid a stone for the church's north tower. During construction, a robin nested atop scaffolding next to the top of one of the main pillars of the nave. Work in that area was deferred until the end of nesting season. R.W. Marsh, who was responsible for production of the many cast stone elements of the interior pillars and arches, suggested that a sculpture of the robin on its nest be placed atop the pillar, and offered to cast one in stone, given a model. Reginald Dove, the architect's assistant, sculpted the bird and nest in clay, and a stone casting of his model was made and installed on the capital of the pillar. In 1933, thanks to an anonymous donation of £5000, a contract was let to continue the north-west tower as far as the bell chamber floor. In 1936, through the generosity of two donors, Mrs. Mozley and Mrs. Matson, a peal of eight bells for change ringing was purchased and installed atop this floor. The bells were made by Mears & Stainbank of Whitechapel, London and were shipped via the Panama Canal. They are of the same design as the peal at Westminster Abbey. The eight tons of steel girders and seven and a half tons of bells were hoisted the seventy feet onto the tower and installed by Yarrows Shipyard of Victoria under the direction of Edward W. Izard in just six working days. As the tower was incomplete, a wooden shed was built over the bells to protect them from the elements. The bells were first rung on July 12, 1936. The installation of concrete and stone facings on the western towers and arch over the cathedral's rose window was completed in 1952. In 1952, a columbarium was constructed under the nave. In 1957, the western towers and the arch over the rose window were completed in concrete with stone facing. To reduce costs, the 20 foot lantern band at the top of each tower was omitted. Skilled stone cutters were in short supply, so workers from Europe were brought to the quarry on Texada Island, where they produced and shipped finished stones. In 1958, a proposal to rebuild the main organ for $40,000 was approved. = Renovations since completion = The high altar which had been brought from the second cathedral was moved to the Lady Chapel. A new free-standing altar was put on a raised platform with the choir behind, and fronted by a semi- circular altar rail. A large hexagonal corona lighting fixture was suspended over the altar to draw attention there. A portable classroom was attached to the rear of the building as choir practice room and vestry. Fairbridge Farms Society offered their Harrison and Harrison organ, which was installed in the west gallery in 1975. The small Bevington organ which had been there was moved to the main floor and put on casters. In 1980, a decision was taken to rebuild the main organ yet again, and to relocate it to an engineered shelf over the west gallery. The Harrison and Harrison organ was moved from the gallery to where the main organ had been. Several years later, two smaller bells were added to the peal of eight. They were dedicated on March 8, 1983 in the presence of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh before being hung in the tower. The Treble is dedicated to the memory of Mr. Izard, who led the ringing in the tower for nearly forty years, and the Second to the Queen's grandson Prince William, Duke of Cambridge. The temporary wooden east wall had become unsound. In 1985, completion of the design with central tower was abandoned, and a design for a worthy completion in the spirit of the original was adopted, a stone-clad addition containing a chapel, vestries, chapter room, and wash rooms. It was expected that the addition might exist with simple sheet metal cladding for many years before stone cladding could be afforded, but several unexpected large bequests came along, which allowed the project to be completed immediately, and removed all construction debt. The exterior was, however, finished not on stone, but in concrete masonry and EIFS. Birds of the precinct have found EIFS to be an ideal substrate for nest cavity construction. Eastern wall of the cathedral. The concrete and EIFS wall replaced a temporary wooden wall in the late 20th century. In 1988, the corona over the altar was removed. In 1994, the columbarium was enlarged. In 1997, bonding and ballasting of the brick vaulting was undertaken as a seismic upgrade. It was to have been parged when constructed, but this was done only on the aisle vaulting. In 2000, a contract for a new four-manual mechanical action pipe organ was signed with Hellmuth Wolff & Associés of Laval QC. Site preparation began in 2002 with removal of the old organ and the shelf on which it stood. It had been thought at the time of signing that the project would have to proceed in several phases due to fund-raising constraints, but by the time that site preparation had begun, pledges for the whole amount were in hand, so the contract was re-negotiated as a single project. This entailed rescheduling to 2004, as the builder had since signed other contracts which he had to fulfil first. The organ was completed in September 2005. In June 2019, the Cathedral became a partner in the Community of Cross of Nails (CCN) founded by Coventry Cathedral after the destruction of it and the city by bombing in the Second World War. The CCN is an international network of churches and organizations committed to healing the wounds of history, learning to live with differences and celebrate diversity, praying and working for peace, justice and reconciliation. In Christ Church, the former baptistry was re-dedicated as the Chapel of Reconciliation and Cross of Nails by the Dean of Coventry, The Very Reverend John Witcombe, who presented the Cathedral with a Cross of Nails which was mounted on the wall below the carved words \\"Creator Forgive.\\" An explanatory marble plaque was also mounted on the wall.

Rabbi Berger addresses the Chabad- Messianic question, regarding a dead Messiah, from a halachic perspective. The book is written as a historical narrative of Berger's encounter with Chabad messianism from the time of the death of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson in 1994 through the book's publication in 2001. The narrative is interlaced with Dr. Berger's published articles, written correspondences, and transcribed public lectures, in which he passionately appeals to both the leadership of the Orthodox and Chabad communities for an appropriate response to Chabad-Lubavitch messianism.  Criticism of Chabad- Lubavitch messianism  Berger, an academic expert on Jewish responses to Christianity, particularly claims of Jesus' messiahship and divinity, criticized what he viewed as similar assertions made by some religious leaders of the Chabad-Lubavitc movement about Schneerson shortly after Schneerson's death in 1994 and even in 2014.\\"the Rebbe is the mashiach, will come back as the mashiach, he always was here as the mashiach\\", Rosh Yeshiva Rebbe Tuvia Bolton from Kfar Chabad, Israel, citation from 42:63 and on. Citation from 21:40 and on. Berger argues that the assertion a person could begin a messianic mission, die, and posthumously return to complete his mission has been unanimously rejected by the Sages and Jewish polemicists for nearly 2,000 years. An example of Berger's proof-texts is the passage in the Talmud which shows that Rabbi Akiva set aside his previous assertions of Simon bar Kokhba's presumed messiahship after bar Kokhba was put to death. To Berger, the Messianists' viewpoint on this issue is outside the pale of accepted Orthodox Jewish belief. Berger has been highly disappointed by the Orthodox establishment's reaction to Chabad-Lubavitch's claims that Schneerson is the Jewish messiah, arguing that there is a \\"scandal of Orthodox indifference\\".  Support  His views are shared and supported by many prominent Orthodox authorities, including the late Rosh yeshiva (\\"dean\\") Rabbi Elazar Shach (see Elazar Shach: Opposition to the Lubavitcher Rebbe) and the vehement opposition of the Rabbinical Seminary of America (Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim) in New York City, and that of the Rabbinical Council of America (See Chabad messianism: Rabbinical Council of America.) Rabbi Aharon Feldman, the dean of the non- Hasidic Yeshiva Ner Yisrael: Ner Israel Rabbinical College in Baltimore, Maryland, wrote a widely disseminated letter in 2004 which stated that Orthodox Jews should avoid praying in Chabad synagogues that avowed a belief in the Rebbe as the Messiah. He stated that while there is nothing in Jewish law stating that the messianist views of Chabad-Lubavitch are heretical per se, they \\"dig under the foundations of Torah fundamentals\\" and any support of them should be avoided.Public Responsa from Rabbi Aharon Feldman on the matter of Chabad messiansim (Hebrew), 23 Sivan, 5763 - http://moshiachtalk.tripod.com/feldman.pdf. See also Rabbi Feldman's letter to David Beger: http://www.stevens.edu/golem/llevine/feldman_berger_sm_2.jpg Berger is a highly popular figure in Modern Orthodox circles. Following Yeshiva University President Rabbi Norman Lamm's announcement that he would retire in 2001, Berger placed second on an online poll which asked who Lamm's successor should be. In 1996, largely at his behest, the Rabbinical Council of America, the largest organization of Modern Orthodox rabbis in the United States, approved the following resolution: > In light of disturbing developments which have recently arisen in the Jewish > community, the Rabbinical Council of America in convention assembled > declares that there is not and has never been a place in Judaism for the > belief that Mashiach ben David will begin his Messianic mission only to > experience death, burial, and resurrection before completing it. Berger felt that the RCA resolution was a very significant turning point for his cause, as he recounts in his book that after the resolution was approved, \\"the thunder-bolt struck.\\"  Conflict over Rav Ahron Soloveichik's position In June 1996, The Jewish Press published a paid advertisement that included a letter with Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik's signature. The letter included the assertion that Soloveitchik believed Schneerson to have been worthy of being Messiah, that the Chabad position that Schneerson was the Messiah could not be dismissed as heretical, and cited a number of sources to demonstrate that he could be the Messiah. The letter also attacked Chabad's critics, and praised Chabad's works.Image of the advertisement in The Jewish Press, June 28 1996 Many messianists believe that Soloveichik defended their position and bring him as a source to back up their arguments. Yet the letter caused confusion as this was a reversal of Soloveichik's previous position on the matter. In 1994, Soloveichik had told The Forward that Schneerson \\"can't be the Messiah - he is not living - a Messiah has to be living. A living Messiah, not a dead Messiah.\\" He had also expressed shock at the idea that anyone could suggest that the Messiah could be from among the dead noting that \\"that could be possible in the Christian faith, but not Judaism\\" adding that this was \\"repugnant to everything Judaism represents.\\"Rabbis Blast Lubavitcher Messianism, Warn Resurrection Talk Echoes Christian Themes, Lucette Lagnado, The Forward, December 2, 1994 Berger provides a letter from Soloveitchik to a friend in 2000, that resolves the contradiction between his two positions. Soloveichik writes: > To my great dismay. . . publications affiliated with the Lubavitch movement > have persisted in stating that I validate their belief that a Jewish Messiah > may be resurrected from the dead. I completely reject and vigorously deny > any such claim. As I have already stated publicly. . . such a belief is > repugnant to Judaism and is the antithesis of the truth. My intent in > signing the original letter . . . was merely to express my opinion that we > should not label subscribers to these beliefs as heretics.

(The book is an expanded edition and translation into Hebrew > of: The Rebbe, The Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference)  Criticism  David Singer, Director of Research for the American Jewish Committee, wrote a critique of the book in First Things, stating, among other things, that Berger has \\"emerged as a would-be Torquemada on the Orthodox scene, demanding a policy of 'intolerance' and 'exclusion' toward those he deems to be heretical to Orthodoxy.\\"Singer, David, \\"The Rebbe, the Messiah, and the Heresy Hunter\\", First Things, May 2003. Reprinted on the OrthdoxyToday.org website. Berger responded at length on the OrthodoxyToday.org website, where Singer's article had been reprinted.Berger, David, \\"Response to David Singer\\", OrthodoxyToday.org, accessed May 28, 2006. Likewise, Professor Aviezer Ravitzky, of Hebrew University, strongly disputes Berger's claims that new Chabad teachings amount to heresy; however he does not believe that such beliefs are correct. In regards to those who wait for Schneerson to return from the dead as a messiah, Ravitzky stated \\"Torah does not prohibit a person from being stupid.\\" Chaim Rapoport has responded with a book-length critique entitled \\"The Messiah Problem: Berger, the Angel and the Scandal of Reckless Indiscrimination\\". Jacob Immanuel Schochet attempted to demonstrate that the criticisms are unfounded or distorted. He questioned the many anonymous anecdotes and attributions in Berger's book, as well as Berger's reliance on the innuendo and unsubstantiated accusation by individuals known for their persistent opposition to Hasidism in general and Chabad Hasidism in particular.

Background Jones and Haggard had previously recorded one album together in 1982, A Taste of Yesterday's Wine, which produced the number one single \\"Yesterday's Wine\\". Their friendship stretched much farther back, however, to when Jones first heard the Haggard-penned \\"I Threw Away the Rose,\\" which rose to number 2. In his 1981 autobiography Merle Haggard: Sing Me Back Home, Haggard recalls playing somewhere in Texas when someone handed him a phone saying Jones was on the line. Jones slurred his appreciation for the song and said he was coming to see him immediately. \\"It wasn't hard to see that ol' George was pretty wasted,\\" Haggard wrote. \\"I hung up the phone and some of the others in the room said they wouldn't be surprised if he showed up. I told them I didn't think so, 'cause hell, he was supposed to be doing concerts all week.\\" The next day Jones arrived, kicking the door in and eventually folding up the roll-away bed that Haggard's sleeping manager Fuzzy Owen was on and wheeling it out of the room. Jones would record \\"I Threw Away the Rose\\" himself, as well as several other Haggard compositions over the course of his career, and say repeatedly over the years that, next to Hank Williams, Haggard was his favorite singer. In 1996, Jones was a surprise guest on an episode of TNN's Prime Time Live that was saluting Haggard and, in 1997, Jones and Haggard performed a rendition of \\"The Way I Am\\" together on another TV special honoring Haggard called Workin' Man - A Tribute. A year later Haggard returned the favor by appearing on The George Jones Show, a series of television specials on TNN. Haggard also took a guest spot on Jones's 1998 song \\"It Just Doesn't Get Any Better Than This\\", which also features other country icons like Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash. Recording Twenty-five years after their last album, Jones and Haggard took a different approach in 2006, each singing five songs originally recorded by the other, then teaming up for four full-fledged duets. One of these is the title track, which chronicles the tales of an aging country singer, a song clearly intended to appear somewhat autobiographical for these two legends (when Haggard appeared on Jones's television show, Jones requested that Haggard sing a verse of it and called it his favorite Hag song). Jones had previously recorded Haggard's early hit \\"All My Friends Are Strangers\\" when he was on the Musicor record label in the 1960s. Haggard had recorded Jones's smash \\"She Thinks I Still Care\\" on his 1969 album A Portrait of Merle Haggard. Kickin' Out The Footlights...Again would be the final proper studio album recorded by Jones before his death in 2013. Reception The album reached number 25 on the Billboard country albums chart and received positive reviews, although many critics took note of Jones's increasingly withered voice. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote \\"Of the two, George sounds a bit worse for wear—his voice is a little thin and slightly scratchy—but even if their age is evident... the album also illustrates exactly why Jones and Haggard are two of the greatest vocalists in country music history.\\" Music critic Robert Christgau wrote \\"Hag keeps getting Haggier, but that thing in George's voice that was grainy like cornbread is turning to mush.\\" Track listing Personnel * Merle Haggard - vocals, guitar * George Jones - vocals * Norm Hamlet - pedal steel guitar * Eddie Bayers - drums * Doug Colosio - piano * Hargus \\"Pig\\" Robbins - piano * Stuart Duncan - fiddle, mandolin * Larry Franklin - fiddle * Paul Franklin - steel guitar * Scott Joss - guitar * Liana Manis - background vocals * Brent Mason - acoustic & electric guitar * John Wesley Ryles - background vocals * Marty Slayton - background vocals * Keith Stegall - Producer * Norman Stevens - guitar * Rhonda Vincent - background vocals * Bruce Watkins - acoustic guitar * Kevin Williams - bass * Glenn Worf - bass Production * Merle Haggard - producer * Keith Stegall - producer * Lou Bradley - producer, engineer * Susan Nadler - executive producer * Evelyn Shriver - executive producer * Matt Rovey - engineer, assistant engineer * Jason Campbell - production coordination * Michael Campbell - project manager * John Kelton - engineer, mixing * Matt Lumpkin - photography * Nancy Jones - photography * Jerry Jordan - photography * Todd Tilwell - assistant engineer * David Gulliver - assistant engineer * Nathan Dickinson - assistant engineer * Hank Williams - mastering References 2006 albums George Jones albums Merle Haggard albums Vocal duet albums Albums produced by Keith Stegall ","title":"Kickin' Out the Footlights...Again"},{"id":"6460327","title":"Sit Down and Listen to Hooverphonic"},{"id":"6460329","text":"The Indian Forest Act, 1927 was largely based on previous Indian Forest Acts implemented under the British. The most famous one was the Indian Forest Act of 1878. Both the 1878 act and the 1927 act sought to consolidate and reserve the areas having forest cover, or significant wildlife, to regulate movement and transit of forest produce, and duty leviable on timber and other forest produce. It also defines the procedure to be followed for declaring an area to be a Reserved Forest, a Protected Forest or a Village Forest. It defines what is a forest offence, what are the acts prohibited inside a Reserved Forest, and penalties leviable on violation of the provisions of the Act. History Dietrich Brandis set up the Indian Forest Service in 1864 and helped formulate the Indian Forest Act of 1865.The Indian Forest Act of 1865 extended the British colonialism in India and claimed over forests in India. The 1865 act was a precursor to the Forest Act of 1878, which truncated the centuries-old traditional use by communities of their forests and secured the colonial governments control over the forestry. The act of 1865 empowered the British government to declare any land covered with trees as a government forest and make rules to manage it.The government mainly used the woods for railway sleepers manufacture.This law also made teak wood a government property.  Reserved Forest  Reserved Forest is an area mass of land duly notified under the provisions of India Forest Act or the State Forest Acts having full degree of protection. In Reserved Forests, all activities are prohibited unless permitted. Reserved Forest is notified under section 20 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927 [Act 16 of 1927] or under the reservation provisions of the Forest acts of the State Governments. It is within power of a State Government to issue a preliminary notification under section 4 of the Act declaring that it has been decided to constitute such land, as specified in a Schedule with details of its location, area and boundary description, into a Reserved Forest. Such a notification also appoints an officer of the State Government, normally the Deputy Commissioner of the concerned district, as Forest Settlement Officer. The Forest Settlement Officer fixes a period not less than three months, to hear the claims and objections of every person having or claiming any rights over the land which is so notified to be reserved. He conducts inquiries into the claims of rights, and may reject or accept the same. He is empowered even to acquire land over which right is claimed. For rights other than that of right of way, right of pasture, right to forest produce, or right to a water course, the Forest Settlement Officer may exclude such land in whole or in part, or come to an agreement with the owner for surrender of his rights, or proceed to acquire such land in the manner prescribed under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 [Act 1 of 1894]. Once the Forest Settlement Officer settles all the rights either by admitting them or rejecting them, as per the provisions of the Act, and has heard appeals, if any, and settled the same, all the rights with the said piece land, boundaries of which might have been altered or modified during the settlement process, vest with the State Government. Thereafter, the State Government issues notification under section 20 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927 declaring that piece of land to be a Reserved Forest.

The story was first published in the Danish Anders And & Co. #2001-43; the first American publication was in Uncle Scrooge #339, in March 2005. Plot To make up for the loss of the Crown of Genghis Khan, Scrooge McDuck and his nephews looks for its Western equivalent, the Crusader Kings' crown, sent to Cathay on Cristoforo Colombo's expedition in 1492 and still hidden in the Caribbean. To locate it, they first recover Colombo's logbook in a hut in the Arctic, left there by explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld, and read that \\"the templar hid the crown\\". They visit the International Money Council (already mentioned in the Carl Barks' comic The Fabulous Philosopher's Stone) in Paris looking for additional clues, and Director Molay reveals to them that the Knights Templars, a crusader order which evolved into Europe's first bank network, ceded to the Kings of Spain and Portugal the crown to be sent to Cathay, in exchange of a share of the future trade, with the proviso that, should the voyage fail to reach its destination, the contract would become null and void by October 13, 1582, and the crown would be returned to the Order. It's also mentioned that the Templars, whose properties were seized by Philip IV of France, managed to spirit away their treasury in several locations, including Scotland. Molay accompanies the Ducks to Haiti, but purposefully attempts to send them on a wild goose chase. When they nevertheless manage to locate the crown, he claims ownership of it, as the IMC was formerly the Bank of the Templar Order. The Ducks manage to prove that his claim is null and void because of the switch to the Gregorian calendar (executed by skipping ten days), which meant that there never was an October 13, 1582. Eventually, however, the government of Haiti is recognized as the rightful owner of the crown, and Scrooge is satisfied by keeping the fabric on which the crown was wrapped in as it's the Clan McDuck tartan, indicating the Knights Templar's vast treasure is located at Castle McDuck.

Schmidt (born 1957) is an American author of children's and young adults' fiction books. He currently resides in Alto, Michigan, where he is a professor of English at Calvin University.  Life and literary career   Early life and education  Gary D. Schmidt was born in Hicksville, New York, in 1957. As a child, Schmidt says he was underestimated by teachers at an elementary school where students were classified by aptitude. Concerning his early education, Schmidt explained in an interview with NPR: \\"If you're Track One you're the college-bound kid; if you're Track Two you'll have a good job; if you're Track Three you're the stupid kid. And I was tracked as Track Three.\\" After intervention from a concerned teacher, Schmidt found a love for reading, an event which served as inspiration for his novel The Wednesday Wars. In the mid 1970s, Schmidt attended Gordon College, earning an undergraduate degree in English in 1979. Thereafter he attended University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, obtaining a master's degree in English in 1981 before graduating with a PhD in medieval literature in 1985. Schmidt has since worked as a professor for the English department at Calvin College.  Awards and honors  In 2005, Schmidt's novel Lizzie Bright and the Buckminster Boy was awarded a Newbery Honor, which recognizes \\"the most distinguished contribution[s] to American literature for children\\", and a Printz Honor. In 2008, he was awarded a second Newbery Honor for The Wednesday Wars. Schmidt's novel Okay for Now, the 2011 sequel to The Wednesday Wars, was a National Book Award finalist.  Personal life  In 1996, Schmidt was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer. While being treated, he was exposed to a variety of other cancer patients whose stories, he claims, served as inspiration for future novels and encouraged him to write primarily for children and young adults. Schmidt and his late wife, Anne, have six children; one is a teacher. He is a practicing Christian and describes himself as religious. He also enjoys teaching writing courses in prisons and detention centers, and experiences there served as inspiration for his novel Orbiting Jupiter.

History Welsh mapmaker David Thompson was one of the great explorers of the North West Company in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and is often called \\"Canada's Greatest Geographer\\". He covered 130,000 kilometres on foot and surveyed most of the Canada–United States border in the early days of exploration. One of the first efforts to encourage Welsh emigration to Canada began in 1812, when Welsh native John Mathews endeavoured to bring his family to Canada. Mathews left home at a young age and went on to become a successful businessman in the United States. When he returned to Wales, he found his family living in poverty and became convinced they should emigrate to Canada. In 1817 his family settled in the township of Southwald, near what is now London, Ontario. By 1812 he had brought over more relatives who built homes on the lots granted to them by Colonel Thomas Talbot. The colony attracted 385 Welsh settlers by 1850 and retained its predominantly Welsh character until the late 1870s. Early Welsh immigration to Canada was also spurred on by the Cariboo Gold Rush in British Columbia in 1858. The development of underground mining provided employment for many Welsh coal miners who decided to remain in the area. In 1902, Welsh immigrants arrived from Patagonia, which had been incorporated into Argentina in 1881. Compulsory military service and a series of floods that ruined Welsh farmers' crops led to some emigrants resettling at Llewelyn near Bangor, Saskatchewan, where they once again took up farming. A community of Welsh farmers was also established at Wood River near Ponoka, Alberta. Welsh in Alberta Historically, Alberta has had the highest number of people of Welsh descent as a proportion to population. In the 2016 Census, there are 80,455 people identifying as being of Welsh descent, which is around 2 % of the total population of Alberta.[Census Profile, 2016 Census Alberta - Ethnic Origin] *Earl W. Bascom (1906-1995), artist, inventor, rodeo pioneer, \\"Father of Modern Rodeo\\" and of Welsh descent *David Milwyn Duggan, a Welshman, was the mayor of Edmonton from 1921 to 1923. Culture Welsh festivals in Canada today include Eisteddfodau, and Gymanfa Ganu. The Welsh in Canada celebrate St. David's Day, March 1st, the celebrations include storytelling and singing; banquets are also held in Lethbridge, Ponoka, Calgary, Red Deer, Edmonton, Regina, Saskatchewan, and Fort McMurray. In Eastern Canada, the Central New Brunswick Welsh Society celebrates St. David's Day by hoisting the Welsh flag on March 1st at both the Provincial Legislature and City Hall in Fredericton, followed by a dinner for members and guests. A newsletter serves the Welsh communities in Calgary and Lethbridge, while in Edmonton the St. David's Society issues a bulletin twice a year informing its members about upcoming events. Some Welsh Canadians subscribe to Ninnau, the Welsh national newspaper published in New York. Welsh-Canadians have been active in the country's cultural life, supplying Canada with some of its more lively characters including novelist Robertson Davies, Powys Thomas, co- founder of the national theatre school, and Robert Harris, painter of the Fathers of Confederation.

Amateur career Randolph had an outstanding amateur career. Randolph was a product of the Tacoma Boys Club amateur program, along with fellow Olympic Gold Medalist Sugar Ray Seales, and future world champions Rocky Lockridge and Johnny Bumphus. Randolph was trained as an amateur and professional by Joe Clough, the head trainer at the Tacoma Boys Club. In 1975 he was the National Golden Gloves Flyweight champion. He was a National AAU flyweight champion, and was the 1976 Olympic Flyweight Gold Medalist. Leo Randolph's 1976 Montreal Olympic boxing results were as follows: * 1st round bye * Defeated Massoudi Samatou (Togo) walkover * Defeated Constantin Gruiescu (Romania) 4-1 * Defeated Davy Larmour (Ireland) 4-1 * Defeated Leszek Błażyński (Poland) 4-1 * Defeated Ramón Duvalón (Cuba) 3-2 Professional career Randolph turned pro in 1978. In 1980, with a record of 16-1, he challenged Ricardo Cardona for the WBA Super Bantamweight Title in a bout held in Seattle. Randolph won via TKO in the 15th round. In his next fight, he lost his title to Sergio Victor Palma via TKO in the 5th. Randolph retired after the bout. He currently holds the record for the earliest retirement ever by a former professional world boxing champion, and at two years and fifty days, Randolph also holds the record for the shortest career for any world boxing champion. Randolph-Palma fight After winning the World Boxing Association super bantamweight championship from Ricardo Cardona on May 4, 1980, Randolph made his first title defense versus Argentina's Sergio Palma three months later in Spokane, WA on August 9, 1980. The bout was nationally televised. Palma was not generally known to have an aggressive style or be a hard puncher, but he immediately went on the offensive from the opening bell. Palma staggered Randolph early in the first round, staggered him again, and then floored the champion twice before the round ended. Pressing his advantage, Palma dominated round two, clearly overwhelming the young champion. Randolph rallied in both rounds three and four by boxing defensively, but Palma reasserted himself in round five. Randolph was knocked down for the third time in the contest and rose on shaky legs. Referee Stanley Christodoulou counted beyond the mandatory eight count as Randolph stood groggily with his right hand draped over the top rope. He stopped the fight at 1:12 of the round, ruling that Randolph was in no condition to continue. According to an article written by Jim Benagh in the November 1980 edition of The Ring magazine, Randolph, a deeply religious man, said he did not have the necessary killer instinct to continue as a professional boxer and voluntarily chose to retire from the ring at age 22. Personal Leo now resides in his hometown of Tacoma. After boxing, he started working for the Pierce Transit public bus company in 1988. He works as a Transit Operator and supervisor.

Squire Challenor spent much of his family fortune to reopen the tin mines near his village in Devonshire in an effort to give employment to the poor people of the region. On the Squire's death, The Squire's son, Geoffrey, in need of funds, leased his family manor to the wealthy Sir Joseph Verity. Geoffrey then went to sea to seek his fortune. Geoffrey's childhood sweetheart, Marjorie, also left the village, but flirtatious Nan stayed at home, spending time with Sir Joseph, his son Douglas and a number of other gentlemen. Evie Greene as Nan Five years after Geoffrey left the village, Sir Joseph has plans for Douglas to be elected to Parliament representing the borough. He also has an interest in the influential society lady, Mrs. Quinton Raikes, recently legally decreed a widow following the disappearance of her husband in the Himalayas. Mrs. Raikes resists his advances, but she is short of money. She agrees that Madam Sophie should stay at the manor as a friend to compensate for not being able to pay her bill. Sophie is in seventh heaven, for this is the village where she grew up, and she is delighted to be able to show her old friends how she has risen in the world. Geoffrey Challoner and his faithful friend and assistant, Barry, return to town from the orient. Barry realizes that the villagers would much prefer to elect Geoffrey to Parliament than the unenthusiastic Douglas, who is more interested in Nan than the election. Marjorie joy has also come back from London where she has become a singing star under an assumed name. She wants Geoffrey to find her as he left her and, hiding her fine clothes, she dons her old blue dress and sunbonnet for their meeting. Geoffrey's ship has brought some Eastern passengers, the Rajah of Bhong and his fiancée, Princess Mehelaneh. However, the Rajah is an Englishman, and the Princess is a modern young lady. She has insisted on being brought to Britain to be presented at the local Emperor's court before her marriage to the Rajah, and he is strangely anxious to get their business over and leave the country again. The Rajah, it turns out, was once the husband of Mrs. Raikes. It was to escape his wife that he went off to the Himalayas, so he prefers to remain \\"dead\\" according to British law. The Princess, on the other hand, is not so anxious to be on her way. She has learned from Barry that in England one may choose (within reason) one's preferred spouse, and she is soon busy sizing up alternatives to her nervous Rajah. Huntley Wright as Barry, disguised as Edna Barry attempts to raise money for Geoffrey by selling off the worthless old tin mine to Sir Joseph on the pretext that providing work for the locals will earn his son the votes he needs to win the election. He also discovers that Madam Sophie, now living at the manor, is his old sweetheart. The Princess, who has also installed herself at the manor, has decided that her choice of husband shall be Geoffrey, whom she will bring to her native land. Geoffrey, politely kissing the Princess's hand, declines the oriental match. Marjorie, who has seen only the kiss, tearfully goes back to London and the stage. ;Act II - Interior of the Ministry of Fine Arts. At the London house of Lord Anchester, an old friend of the Rajah, a ball is being held. Attending is Nan, the Rajah, accompanied by the Princess (desperately avoiding his widowed wife and longing for the happy land of Bhong), Sophie, still under the social protection of Mrs. Raikes who clearly hasn't yet paid her dressmaker's bill, and Marjorie Joy in her London persona as Miss Montague. Geoffrey is fascinated by her, as he finds in her an amazing resemblance to his lost sweetheart. Barry is disguised as an old lady to get in past the doorman. Amusing complications ensue, including Sir Joseph's attempts to flirt with the disguised Barry, who seeks refuge in the arms of the surprised Rajah. In the hearing of Miss Montague, Geoffrey squarely refuses the Princess's renewed offer in favour of the love of his 'little country girl'. When Lord Anchester requests the actress to favour the company with a song, she reveals her double identity to a grateful Geoffrey. All pair off happily.

Educated at Harvard University (AB 1952, PhD 1960), he did a postdoctorate in African Studies, Anthropology and Ecology at the London School of Economics, followed by positions with the Rhodes-Livingston Institute for Social Research in Northern Rhodesia 1956-1957 and again in 1962-1963, and a post at the American University in Cairo in 1961-1962. He joined the Caltech faculty in that year. His work on socioeconomic issues and infrastructure development associated with river basin development, forced relocation, and refugee reintegration has made him a world leader in these fields. Large dams are one of the world’s most controversial, divisive and expensive development issues, and Scudder is the world's leading expert on dams and relocation effects. His 2005 book \\"The Future of Large Dams\\" covers aspects of large dams and development including economics, politics, environmental risk, energy, agriculture, and human displacement and resettlement. He has undertaken studies on sustainable resource use in Africa, India, Nepal, Jordan, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and the United States, and served on a number of independent review panels for dam projects in Africa and Asia. He is a former commissioner on the World Commission on Dams. In addition to expertise and special interest in regional development, irrigated and rainfed agriculture, pioneer settlement, community- based natural resource management, and impacts of large-scale river basin development projects on low income populations, Scudder has focused on systematic long-term studies of low income human communities. The most classic of his long-term studies has been carried out with anthropologist Elizabeth Colson among the Gwembe Tonga of Zambia. Author Jacques Leslie devotes a third of his narrative nonfiction book Deep Water: The Epic Struggle Over Dams, Displaced People, and the Environment (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2005) to a portrait of Scudder. The section includes a visit to the Zambian resettlement village where many Gwembe Tonga now live and follows Scudder as he inspects dam projects in Lesotho and Botswana.

It is a classic dish of the Viennese cuisine and popular in all of Austria and the neighboring German state of Bavaria. Franz Joseph I, Emperor of Austria, was a great lover of Tafelspitz. According to the 1912 official cookery textbook used in domestic science schools of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, \\"His Majesty's private table is never without a fine piece of boiled beef, which is one of his favorite dishes.\\"  The dish  Tafelspitz is simmered along with root vegetables and spices in the broth. It is usually served with roasted slices of potato and a mix of minced apples and horseradish or sour cream mixed with chives. The cut The Tafelspitz is located at #13. Tafelspitz is the Austrian name of the meat cut which is used, usually from a young ox. This cut is typically known in the United States as the Standing Rump or Top Round, depending on the nomenclature of cuts used. The British cut would be called Topside. In Australia, it is called the Rump Cap. It is the top hind end of the cattle where the tail originates. Alternatively, a similar cut of beef from a young ox, properly hung, with firm white fat (not yellow). The fat can be left on to prevent the meat from becoming dry. Austrian butchers gave almost every muscle of beef a separate name.

N. and A. M. Williamson\\" and \\"Mrs. C. N. Williamson,\\" was an American-English author. Biography She was born 8 October 1858 to parents Marcus and Jane (Thomas) King in Cleveland, Ohio, where her father was co-founder of the Ohio State and Union Law College. In 1890 she adopted the surname \\"Livingston\\" (from her maternal great grandfather) following separation from her first husband, Lieut. William Reeve Hamilton, who disapproved of her budding career as an actress. In 1892 she expatriated herself to England (and from her first husband) as foreign correspondent for the Boston Evening Transcript, supplying that paper with approximately 120 \\"letters\\" between 1892 and 1897 before devoting herself full-time to fiction, although she remained an occasional freelance journalist for the rest of her life. Two years after arriving in England she married well-known magazine editor, Charles Norris Williamson (1857-1920), whom she persuaded to appear as co-author for many of her books (later acknowledging her sole authorship). Her success as an author, in its early stages, was owing to Alfred Harmsworth who, recognizing her talent, promoted her stories – especially sensational serial stories – in the Daily Mail and his many other publications. Her first serial, \\"Confessions of a Stage-Struck Girl,\\" appeared in Forget-Me-Not (August 11-November 17, 1894), partly inspired by her own earlier career as an actress in America, as was her first novel, The Barnstormers (1897), written at the suggestion of S. R. Crockett upon hearing her describe some of her theatrical experiences at a dinner party. Her second novel, A Woman in Grey (1898) established her reputation as the successor to Wilkie Collins. A third, The Newspaper Girl (1899), exploited Elizabeth Banks's notorious \\"stunt\\" journalism, turning some of the same stratagems to humorous effect. Humor would become one of her most striking characteristics as an author, beginning with The Lightning Conductor (1902), the novel that catapulted her overnight to international fame, selling more than a million copies in America. James Milne, in Memoirs of a Bookman (1934), speaks of a \\"tradition\\" that she was \\"the wittiest girl who ever invaded Fleet Street.\\" Although best known for her series of motor travel romances, she was a literary polymath adept at a wide variety of genres (detective, mystery, Gothic, intrigue, spy, adventure, war, ghost, fairy, satire, fictional memoir, muckraking, etc.), often published anonymously or pseudonymously, such as Champion: The Story of a Motor Car (1907) as by John Colin Dane (memoirs narrated by the car itself), and her sensational exposé of German war plans on the eve of WWI, What I Found Out in the House of a German Prince (1915), purporting to be \\"by an American-English Governess,\\" which was accepted as a true account and published serially in the Fortnightly Review. She died 24 September 1933 at Bath, where her remains are interred next to those of her husband in the graveyard behind Bath Abbey.

History Akron Children's Hospital began as a day nursery in 1890. In 2010, it was the largest pediatric health care provider in northeast Ohio. Akron Children's Hospital has 78 locations throughout the region, including a 289-bed campus in downtown Akron and a 32-bed campus in Boardman, Akron Children's Hospital has approximately 4,600 employees and cares for more than half a million children and adults each year. Akron Children's offers a full range of services to its 25-county region, including well visits and trauma and intensive care to treatment of rare and serious childhood disorders. Children's main campus in downtown Akron houses regional centers for genetics, fetal treatment, cancer and blood disorders, heart, palliative care, orthopedics, pediatric trauma, pediatric intensive care, and level III neonatal intensive care, among others. Children's is one of two pediatric hospitals in the country that operates a burn center for both adults and children. Akron Children's Paul and Carol David Foundation Burn Institute is among a few burn centers verified by both the American Burn Association and The Committee on Trauma of The American College of Surgeons. Akron Children's Beeghly Campus in Boardman includes a 32-bed pediatric inpatient unit; a Level II pediatric trauma center; a center for childhood cancer and blood disorders; an infusion center, as well as EEG/ECHO/EKG, radiology, laboratory and rehabilitation services. Services based in the Mahoning Valley include a 33-bed neonatal special care nursery; child advocacy, community outreach and education center; and subspecialty practices for cardiology, orthopedics, nephrology, neurology, rheumatology, pulmonology and genetics.

Akron Children's Hospital has earned the Gold Seal of Approval from the Joint Commission and Magnet Recognition Statushttps://www.akronchildrens.org/cms/news/94ae66b3a30095a2/ from the American Nurses Credentialing Center. Controversy In November 2013, the hospital went to court to prevent an 11-year-old Amish leukemia patient and her parents from making treatment decisions, when the patient chose to discontinue a second round of chemotherapy after it made her \\"extremely ill.\\" An appeals court ruled that the state's duty to protect the child's well-being outweighed the parents' beliefs and convictions, and an attorney who was also a nurse, was given limited guardianship of the child. As a result of the hospital's actions, the patient's family went into hiding to avoid having their daughter kidnapped. The girl's father told the Associated Press that the family does not oppose modern medicine nor did they make their decision based on religious beliefs. In 2014, the court-appointed guardian was allowed to stop her efforts to force the family to resume chemotherapy; the guardian stated that she didn't have access to the child, making it impossible for her to make medical decisions. In October 2015, the court formally ended the guardianship. Affiliations and programs The hospital is a clinical training site for undergraduate and graduate registered nurse (RN) students and licensed practical nurse (LPN) students from 35 affiliated nursing schools across Ohio and additional schools in West Virginia, Missouri, Illinois, and Colorado, and is also a clinical training site for the Radiologic Technology (RT) program from The University of Akron.

Students of the Materials Science and Engineering department then reported findings of the forensic analysis during a two-day joint Lehigh-NASA symposium. This became part of their senior project, a requirement for graduation. Lehigh was the first university to investigate the debris due to its advanced microscope technology. The escalator Jesse W. Reno, an 1883 engineering graduate of Lehigh University invented the first escalator and installed it as an amusement ride at Coney Island, New York in 1897. This particular device was an inclined belt with wooden slats or cleats on the surface for traction. The incline was as steep as 25°. Reno sold this machine to the Otis Elevator Company in 1899, and together they produced the first commercial escalator. This escalator won a first prize at the Paris 1900 Exposition Universelle in France. Some escalators of this vintage were still being used in the Boston subway until 1994. First Commercial Product Manufactured in Space STS-6 mission patch The first commercial product manufactured in space were microscopic polystyrene beads, 10 µm in diameter, that were made during STS-6 aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger April 4–9, 1983. The beads were made to be used for the calibration of particle size measuring instruments such as optical and electron microscopes. The manufacturing process took advantage of being able to form near perfect spheres in a microgravity environment. The technology necessary to produce the beads was jointly developed by Lehigh University and NASA. Ford Mustang Ford Mustang The legendary Ford Mustang, the first of the \\"pony\\" cars, was developed and introduced in 1964 under the guidance of Lee Iacocca (Lehigh Class of 1946), former general manager of Ford Motor Company's Ford Division. Still in production, the Mustang combined fun, performance and styling at a low price and had the most successful first year sales of any automobile. In its first two years of production, three Ford Motor Company plants produced nearly 1.5 million Mustangs, a record unequaled before or since. Golden Gate Bridge Originally designed by Joseph Strauss, the Golden Gate Bridge construction project was carried out by the McClintic-Marshall Construction Co., founded by Howard H. McClintic and Charles D. Marshall, both of the Lehigh Class of 1888. The project was completed in 1937 in San Francisco Bay. Today the bridge is recognized as one of the \\"Seven Wonders of the Modern World\\". McClintic-Marshall, (later becoming the Fabricated Steel Construction Division of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation), built numerous other bridges, including Detroit's Ambassador Bridge and New York City's George Washington Bridge. Other construction projects included the Waldorf Astoria Hotel and the Panama Canal. Landing Ship Tank Dravo built LST's on D-Day 6 June 1944 A critical factor for the Allied victory in World War II was the rapid development and production of the Landing Ship Tank (LST). A cargo ship with an opening bow capable of beaching itself, it enabled armored support of landings without the need to capture a port. This greatly increased the choice of invasion locations and made defense against the landings more difficult. The Dravo Corporation, founded by brothers Francis Dravo (Lehigh Class of 1887) and Ralph Dravo (Lehigh Class of 1889), was the lead yard responsible for the LST shipbuilding program and produced hundreds of them for use in the Allied landings in Normandy and the Pacific. Dravo Brothers also built Destroyer Escorts for the Battle of the Atlantic and many of the tugboats used in American harbors. Packard V-12 Engine The Packard V-12, a product of the Packard Motor Company that was co-founded by James Ward Packard (Lehigh Class of 1884), was one of the most powerful inline aircraft engines ever manufactured. The 4M-2500 version produced and was essential to the success of US Navy PT Boats in World War II, which were each powered by three of them. James Ward Packard introduced many advances to the internal combustion engine, including the first automatic spark timing advance, allowing an engine to produce more power at higher RPM's and still in use today. P-51 Mustang USAAF P-51B Mustang - First version with Packard Merlin engine One of the most famous fighter aircraft of all time, the P-51 Mustang was the key to gaining air supremacy over Europe in World War II, tripling the kill ratio over Luftwaffe fighters within 3 weeks of its introduction to combat. Initially underpowered with an Allison engine, it rapidly achieved dominance when powered by the Packard Packard V-1650 engine made under license from Rolls Royce. The mass-produced Packard Motor Company (co-founded by James Ward Packard, Lehigh Class of 1884) version of the Merlin was actually found by Rolls Royce to be superior to its own handmade version, and the Packard version powered most P-51s. Packard also made improvements to increase the maintainability of the engine, which were subsequently adopted by Rolls Royce in its own versions. Panama Canal Two firms founded by Lehigh graduates were instrumental in the construction of the Panama Canal. The McClintic- Marshall Construction Company constructed the locks and the Dravo Corporation manufactured the enormous lock gates. The gates were uniquely engineered to float and have adjustable buoyancy. This allowed them to be made in the U.S., towed like a barge to Panama, and minimized the force needed to open and close them. The Panama Canal is recognized as one of the \\"Seven Wonders of the Modern World\\" .  Penske PC-23 Indianapolis Race Car  1994 Penske PC-23 The Penske PC-23, developed by Roger Penske, Lehigh Class of 1959, was one of the most dominant open wheel race cars ever developed. In 1994, it won the Indianapolis 500 and 12 out of 16 total races, collecting 10 pole positions and 28 podium finishes on the way to the CART championship. That season saw Penske Racing simultaneously take the Driver's Championship with Al Unser, Jr., the Constructor's Cup with the Penske PC-23, and the Manufacturer's Cup with the Ilmor-Mercedes-Benz engine. Competing since 1968, Penske Racing has won 16 Indianapolis 500s, more than any other team.  RSA Security Key Factorization  Lehigh University is home to Dr. Bruce Dodson, whose significant contributions to cryptography led to the factorization of RSA-140RSA-140 is Factored! and RSA-155RSA-150 is Factored! on an SGI Origin based supercomputer in 1999. By being able to derive the factors of the encryption keys, it was proven easier to break security schemes based on them. The factorization of RSA-155, a 512-bit key, led to the recommendation that commercial encryption of computer data be based on stronger 1024-bit keys.Factorization of RSA-155 - Frequently Asked Questions Tau Beta Pi Tau Beta Pi (ΤΒΠ), the highly regarded national engineering honor society, was formed at Lehigh University in 1885 to recognize the accomplishments of those in the field of engineering. The seal of Tau Beta Pi features brown and white, the colors of Lehigh. Lehigh's chapter was the first established and is known as the Pennsylvania Alpha.

Cividade de Terroso on top of the hill. Terroso is a suburban area in Póvoa de Varzim, Portugal. It is a former civil parish currently located in União das Freguesias de Aver-o-Mar, Amorim e Terroso. It is an ancient ecclesiastical parish and former civil parish located in Póvoa de Varzim. In the census of 2001, it had a population of 2,472 inhabitants and a total area of 4.63 km². A 2012 law merged the civil parish with neighbouring Amorim and Aver-o-Mar, becoming the northern parish of the city of Póvoa de Varzim. Terroso derives from the Latin ', meaning \\"full of soil\\". The name was used for Cividade or Cividade Hill. History Cividade de Terroso, an ancient Castro city established around 900 and 800 BC is located in the parish of Terroso. But the parish has been shaped by man since much earlier times. Tumuli are known to exist in the area, such as in Leira da Anta and Cortinha da Fonte da Mama. Mamoa de Sejães still exists unbroken after thousands of years. The earliest reference to Terroso dates from 953: \\"'\\", referring to its hill. The remains of a castle tower built in the 13th and 14th centuries can still be found in the Hamlet of Paço. The parish church was built in the first half of the 16th century. It was erected under the orders of King Manuel I. It went through several alterations over the centuries that have changed the original design. The latest involved the building of a second tower with a small carillon. The best piece is a 16th-century statue of the Virgin with legendary origins, probably an Italian work. A chapel dedicated to Saint Savior (São Salvador) was built in the hamlet that took its name. It contains a proto-baroque altar with a painting depicting the miracle of the Battle of Ourique. Also from the 17th century there is a small structure that marks the beginning of the aqueduct. It has 4 columns of the Tuscan order holding a small tile roof. It houses a polychromous statue of St Anthony. The Hamlet of Santo António takes its name from a large baroque chapel dedicated to St. Anthony. The interior of the chapel has some good quality golden gilded carved wood altars. During the Middle Ages it was part of Varzim and the hill was used as one of the borders of the fiefdom under the medieval military and administrative reference \\"'\\". In the modern period, it was under the administration of Barcelos, when it was transferred to the municipality of Póvoa de Varzim in 1836. Geography Terroso is located 5 km north of downtown Póvoa de Varzim; and is bordered by Navais and Estela to the north; Laundos and the municipality of Vila do Conde to the east; Amorim to the west and Beiriz to the south. Most of the parish is crowned by Cividade Hill and it extends to São Lourenço plain. Cividade Hill was known for its pure waters, and an aqueduct was raised in the 17th century, stretching to the Monastery of Santa Clara in Vila do Conde. Hamlets The parish is divided into 15 hamlets: *São Lourenço *Carregal *Passô *Santo António *Paço *Póvoas *São Pedro *São Salvador *Paranho *Vilar *Boavista *Sejães *Certainha *Ordem *Pé do Monte Former civil parishes of Póvoa de Varzim ","title":"Terroso"},{"id":"6460571","text":"J. W. Sexton High School is a public school located on the western edge of Lansing, Michigan, United States, in the Lansing School District. The principal is currently Daniel Boggan. The Sexton Big Reds are members of the Capital Area Activities Conference. The school has a fierce rivalry with the Everett Vikings of Everett High School on the south side of the city. In March 2012 the Lansing School District announced that Sexton would house 7-12 grades beginning in the 2012-2013 school year.  Building and architecture Of the Lansing high schools, J. W. Sexton High School is the most important in terms of architectural innovation. Designed by the architectural firm Warren S. Holmes Company, in its heyday, Architectural Record called Sexton \\"a flexible school with latest facilities\\".\\"Lansing: J. W. Sexton High School.\\" Architectural Record v. 95. Apr 1944: 84. Original designs were begun in 1939, and the school district allowed the firm to take two years to draw up an economic, yet long lasting design. Construction J. W. Sexton High School, conservatory, exterior, 2002 The Warren S. Holmes Co. emphasized that the most important part of the entire project was the planning. The firm spent over a year researching the community's needs and wants to create an appropriate structure. Retired structural engineer and partner of the firm, Howard Hunter, recalled an amusing anecdote. He remembered that when the firm was researching what educators wanted in their new school, the biology/taxidermy teacher said he would like a conservatory large enough to house considerably sized animals and maintain an entire ecosystem. This was of course beyond the scope of a high school and was not constructed. However, a bigger than average conservatory was built to satisfy the teacher.November 2002 personal interview with Howard Hunter, retired structural engineer of Warren S. Holmes Company. Construction commenced in 1941, prior to the United States' involvement in World War II. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December, construction materials were seized by the government for war production. Nevertheless, the Lansing School District sent representatives to Washington D.C. to request materials. After some haggling, the government agreed it was in the country's interests to complete the school. More funding for construction was procured from the Public Works Administration. With these materials and money, construction progressed over the next two years, and the school was ready for occupation in 1943. However, because of the war, some designs were changed and delayed. While the auditorium's exterior was completed in 1943, the interior was not constructed until 1949, well after the war. Because of financial constraints, a natatorium was not added until 1956. Elaborate roofs were scrapped for simple flat roofs, and simple unadorned porcelain fixtures were substituted in place of more elaborate chrome ones. After all construction was completed in 1956, the Lansing School District had spent $2,053,494 (about $26,000,000 in today's dollars). Modular \\"H\\" column cross-section Because of a modular system of construction, the school was constructed rather efficiently. One technique was actually created by the Warren S. Holmes Company. It involved using an \\"H\\" column for all vertical supports. It consisted of reinforced concrete in the form of an \\"H\\", hence the name. These columns were placed every ten feet, and the twelve inch by twelve inch cavities could be used to run conduit, ventilation, and plumbing. All cabinetry, windows, and doors were interchangeable and standardized. According to Architectural Record, each room was planned to be its own complete unit. \\" 'Each unit 10 by 12 ft.,' report the architects, 'was designed as a complete element within itself, having its own light, both artificial and natural, heating, ventilation, electric wiring, case and cupboard spaces, and in general adapting itself to the same utilitarian manner as a sectional bookcase' \\".\\"Lansing: J. W. Sexton High School.\\" Architectural Record v. 95. Apr 1944: 86. Once completed, the school was hailed as having the most modern facilities and innovations. The school has total capacity for 2,056 pupils and includes modern science labs, a home economics lab, a metal shop, a wood shop, a large boiler plant to provide steam heat, several classrooms with stages for dramatics and speech, an auditorium seating 1,783, a cafeteria capacity for 400, and a gymnasium with room for 2,200 spectators.  Exterior Sexton High School was not only an engineering marvel, it was a piece of architectural art. The school was designed at the very end of the Art Deco period. Had it been designed just a few years later, it probably would have been in the International style. The geometric characteristics of the Art Deco style are quite prominent in Sexton's exterior. When one first looks at the building, the eye is immediately drawn to the eight-story clock tower flanking the north end of the building. At the top, the corners have a stepped look, which is common among Art Deco buildings. As the tower grows in height, there are step backs, providing a telescope effect. Below the clock face, narrow glass block windows and chrome spandrels give an extra sense of height to the tower. This verticality, while no longer as prominent of a feature, can still be seen elsewhere on the school. On the front of building above the main entrance, windows once stretched vertically between the spandrels, but have since been replaced with smaller horizontal windows and the remaining cavity was filled with an insulating stucco material. Between the windows, a band of concrete emblazoned with the school's name extends to the top of the building. Originally, all the windows had a vertical effect, but the replacement has altered its appearance. The change is quite apparent in photos to the right and the left. The new windows drastically decrease the sense of verticality. Probably the most unusual feature of Sexton High is its exterior concrete reliefs by Corrado Parducci Hendry, Fay, L., Balthazar Korab, photographs, Outdoor Sculpture of Lansing, iota press, Okemos, Michigan 1980 p. 73+74 and interior decorative tile. On the school's north face, ten educational-based reliefs adorn the side of the auditorium. The sculptures represent art, chivalry, drama, education, geography, labor, law, literature, music, and pioneering. Farther down the wall, a choral group can be seen singing around a piano. Along the sides of the approach to the auditorium, the puppets Punch and Judy can be seen. Additionally, along the two curved exterior walls, the spandrels have more carvings that depict different educational themes.  Interior Inside the school are many subtle decorations. Upon entering the main foyer, the viewer steps upon the mosaic tiled Michigan Seal set into the durable terrazzo floor. These patterns are used at major junctions of the building. Outside the auditorium, drama masks are set into the floor. In the sciences wing, test tubes and a balance demonstrate the sciences. Near the foods lab, or home economics room, the pattern shows textiles and food preparation. Throughout the building decorative tiles are used on the hallways. These tiles were created by the interior designer specifically for Sexton High. To minimize the cost of custom tiles, Warren S. Holmes Co. convinced the tile makers to make the tiles standard stock, with little extra cost to the school district. In fact, Warren S. Holmes Co. used some of the same tiles on other schools later. The variety of tiles is staggering. They represent many different things. Among other tiles, there are Shakespearean characters, mythological creatures, signs of the zodiac, different culture representations, and sports characters. In general, the interior of Sexton High School is large and bright because of the large number of windows. Upon entering the main chrome doors, the hallway opens up into a spacious curve- walled foyer with benches. All the paneling is made of oak and stained a rather light shade. To the left of the foyer is a social room. Originally, it had inlaid hardwood floors and oak wainscoting. While the wainscoting has endured, the hardwood floor has since been covered by a carpet due to years of wear caused by chairs and tables being dragged across it. Other notable rooms include the auditorium and library. The auditorium is large for a high school building and includes a balcony for more accommodation of students. It is simple, yet elegant. The balcony smoothly curves over the orchestra seats and the colors are simple white walls with red chairs—Sexton's colors. The library is equally attractive. Again, oak is the wood of preference. The circulation desk, built-in bookshelves, and furniture are all made of oak. The floor is made of a vinyl linoleum and includes a decorative pattern. Unfortunately, the floor has been covered with carpeting due to years of wear. However, most of the original furniture has remained.

Typically these bearings support a rotating shaft in the bore of the inner ring that must move not only rotationally, but also at an angle. Self-aligning spherical bearings were first used by James Nasmyth around 1840 to support line shaft bearings in mills and machine shops. For long shafts it was impossible to accurately align bearings, even if the shaft was perfectly straight. Nasmyth used brass bearing shells between hemispherical brass cups to align the bearings to self-align. Construction Spherical bearings can be of a hydrostatic or mechanical construction. A spherical bearing by itself consists of an outer ring and an inner ring and a locking feature that makes the inner ring captive within the outer ring in the axial direction only. The outer surface of the inner ring and the inner surface of the outer ring are spherical and are collectively considered the raceway and they slide against each other, either with a lubricant, a maintenance-free (typically polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE) based liner, or they incorporate a rolling element such as a race of ball- bearings, allowing lower friction. Application Spherical bearings are used in countless applications, wherever rotational motion must be allowed to change the alignment of its rotation axis. A good example is the drive axle bearings of a vehicle control arm (or A-arm) suspension. The mechanics of the suspension allow the axle to move up and down (and the wheel to turn in order to steer the vehicle), and the axle bearings must allow the rotational axis of the axle to change without binding. While in practice, spherical bearings are rarely used here, it is a simple concept that illustrates a possible application of a spherical bearing. In fact, spherical bearings are used in smaller sub-components of this type of suspension, for example certain types of constant-velocity joints. Spherical bearings are used in car suspensions, engines, driveshafts, heavy machinery, sewing machines, robotics and many other applications.

In addition to teaching positions at Harvard, Brandeis, St. John's College, Annapolis and NYU, Benardete was a fellow for the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Carl Friedrich von Siemens Stiftung in Munich.http://contemporarythinkers.org/seth-benardete/biography/ Life and family Benardete was born in Brooklyn into an academic family. His father, Maír José Benardete, was a professor of Spanish at Brooklyn College and expert on Sephardic culture.Studies in Honor of M. J. Benardete. Essays in Hispanic and Sephardic Culture, ed. Izaak A. Langnas and Barton Sholod, Las Americas Publishing Co., New York 1965 His older brother José Benardete was a noted philosopher. His younger brother Diego Benardete is a professor of mathematics at the University of Hartford. Seth was married to Jane, a professor of English at Hunter College in Manhattan; and they had two children, Ethan and Alexandra. Career At the University of Chicago in the 1950s he was a student of Leo Strauss, along with Allan Bloom, Stanley Rosen and several others who were to go on to illustrious academic careers. Philipp Fehl was one of his fellow students and a good friend. Benardete wrote his doctoral dissertation on Homer (recently reprinted as Achilles and Hector: The Homeric Hero by St. Augustine's Press). His publications range over the spectrum of classical texts and include works on Homer, Hesiod, Herodotus, the Attic tragedians, and most especially Plato and Aristotle. While his prose is considered by some to be dense and cryptic, as a teacher he regularly impressed his students with his tremendous erudition, which was certainly not limited to classical literature, and by his willingness to take seriously the opinions and thoughts of all his students. Many consider him to be one of America's greatest classical scholars: Harvey Mansfield and Pierre Vidal- Naquet are among those who have praised his achievements. Benardete's method of reading is described by his posture as a reader, following Strauss, in this way: the great writers in a tradition are to be treated as powerful thinkers who have complete control over what they say, how and when they said it, and what they omit. The reader thus risks fundamentally misunderstanding the text of a great author if he dissects elements of the text in such a way that they appear capable of explanation through principles of psychology, anthropology, or other methods which assume that the critic has a greater depth of understanding of the text (or of the human condition) than the author. Further, each successive \\"great\\" writer in a tradition must be assumed to be fully aware and in control of the elements of the philosophical and artistic conversation that arises in the foundational texts. With this perspective Benardete was able to find threads of unity in authors whose works apparently lack cohesiveness (e.g., Herodotus). In the spirit of the continuing engagement of moderns with the classical authors, Benardete showed great respect for the various traditions of commentary (the Alexandrians, the Byzantine editors, and the German tradition of Altertumswissenschaft) in contrast to more recent trends in scholarship which sometimes tend to homogenize the thought of great writers into their cultures and to adduce bits of textual evidence to prove a point without due regard to the entirety of the text from which it is excerpted. Among Benardete's most important works are Herodotean Inquiries (The Hague, 1969); The Being of the Beautiful: Plato’s Theaetetus, Sophist, and Statesman (Chicago, 1984); Socrates’ Second Sailing: On Plato’s Republic (Chicago, 1989); The Rhetoric and Morality of Philosophy: Plato’s Gorgias and Phaedrus (Chicago, 2009); The Tragedy and Comedy of Life: Plato’s Philebus (Chicago, 2009); The Bow and the Lyre: A Platonic Reading of the Odyssey (Lanham, MD, 1997); Plato’s Laws: The Discovery of Being (Chicago 2000); Plato’s Symposium (with Allan Bloom, Chicago 2001).

It is located four miles (6 km) southeast of Okeechobee, on US 441/98, near Taylor Creek. The Battle of Lake Okeechobee, one of the major conflicts of the Second Seminole War, was fought at the site. Part of the battlefield is preserved as Okeechobee Battlefield State Historic Park. Description and history The Okeechobee Battlefield covers an estimated of land on the east side of Taylor Creek. Much of the land is now agricultural, but portions of the battlefield have been developed, and it has been impacted by road construction. The agricultural appearance of the open portions of the battlefield also differ from the time of the battle, when much of the area was overgrown with sawgrass as much as in height. The principal feature of the battlefield is a low hummock, which provided the Seminoles with defensive cover in the engagement. North of this hummock, across what was originally open sawgrass, is a wooded area where Colonel Zachary Taylor made camp prior to the battle. When the battlefield was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1961, an area of that was believed to include the \\"general area\\" of the battlefield was landmarked. In the 1980s, the National Park Service commissioned more detailed studies, and performed some archaeological work in the area, to more precisely identify the battlefield area. As a result, the landmarked area was decreased to above , most of which overlapped parts of the original designation. A marker was placed near the site in 1939, and a portion of the battlefield was purchased by the state of Florida in 2006. A volunteer group sponsors annual reenactments of the Battle of Lake Okeechobee as a fundraising activity for the park.

TMACOG members include governmental and non-governmental organizations in northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan: cities, counties, villages, and townships, as well as schools and colleges, park districts, businesses, and other groups concerned with quality of life in the region. TMACOG is BOTH a Regional Council and a Metropolitan Planning Organization. Membership Current members include the counties of Lucas, Ottawa, and Wood in Ohio, and Monroe County in Michigan. Other members include various cities, villages, townships, businesses, and schools within those counties and the counties of Fulton, Hancock, Henry, Sandusky, and Seneca in Ohio and Lenawee County in Michigan. The TMACOG region includes Fulton, Lucas, Monroe, Ottawa, Sandusky, and Wood counties.http://www.tmacog.org/membership/2013/membermap_TMACOG_10_13.pdf A complete list of members (updated October 2013), along with a map, can be found here. *The city of Fostoria, Ohio is located within the counties of Hancock, Seneca, and Wood; even though Hancock and Seneca counties have no affiliation with TMACOG otherwise. History TMACOG was formed in 1968 \\"primarily to review federally funded projects and to address federal initiatives and local intergovernmental needs.\\" It originally included Lucas, Wood, and Monroe counties, and by 1974 would expand to include Erie, Ottawa, and Sandusky counties into its region. It became the water quality planning agency for the area in 1975 and would be recognized by the state as \\"the areawide agency responsible for carrying out programs that led to planned rural development and urban growth, better transportation systems, improved water and air quality, wiser use of energy and natural resources, and long- term economic vitality.\\" During the 1980s, federal funding worsened and a greater responsibility came to state governments. As a result, many regional councils turned to state governments for funding and direction. TMACOG's membership dropped, including the losses of Erie, Ottawa, Sandusky, and Wood counties. To continue its existence, TMACOG began to focus some of its attention onto railroad projects, energy conservation, air and water pollution, and economic development. The organization also began to focus on small town needs, transportation around the Maumee River, and other beneficial developments around the area. Membership would begin to grow again in the early 1990s, with 60 members in 1993, including the readmission of Ottawa and Wood counties. By adding non-governmental members as well, TMACOG has made its organization more diverse and able to help strengthen the quality of the Toledo area. Initiatives TMACOG partners with other MPOs in Ohio to provide Gohio Commute, a web-based tool which allows commuters to plan trips with a variety of alternatives, like car pooling, biking, and public transit. The service offers rewards to incentivize users to try new modes of transit.https://gohiocommute.com/#/pages/about-tmacog The site became available in 2017.http://www.tmacog.org/BP_17/06_17/06_17_gohio.htm References External links * Toledo metropolitan area Councils of governments Metropolitan planning organizations Fulton County, Ohio Lucas County, Ohio Monroe County, Michigan Ottawa County, Ohio Sandusky County, Ohio Toledo, Ohio Wood County, Ohio ","title":"Toledo Metropolitan Area Council of Governments"},{"id":"6460658","text":"Bernard Long was a British book illustrator and comic artist who contributed many episodes of \\"Fliptail the Otter\\" to Jack and Jill in the 1970s.

He was formerly a police officer with the Dyfed-Powys Police in the Welsh town of Llanelli for 18 years.  Early life Williams was born in Llanelli, Wales, and joined the Dyfed-Powys Police in April 1975 and was stationed at Llanelli where he was mainly in the Road Traffic Department during which time he achieved the covetted Grade 1 Police Advanced Driving Certificate. He is also a trained Police Motorcyclist. Following spells at Llandeilo and Ammanford Police Stations (where he had spells in the CID), he retired in February 1993.  Refereeing career  Williams attained the Class C Snooker Referees accreditation in 1981 and within five years, was the Senior Welsh Referee in the Home International Series. By 1991, his Refereeing Classification had twice been upgraded and he now held the Class 1 (formerly A) certificate. In 1991, the Professional tour, run by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) opened the Professional game to an unlimited number of players thus requiring more Referees to officiate at the subsequent extra matches. He was invited to join the Professional Referees Association and became one of a significant number of new Referees from around the globe to give their services to the Professional game. Following his retirement from the Police Service, he undertook several jobs to subsidise his income while he climbed his way up the Professional Refereeing ladder. By 1993, he had been appointed as a Referee Examiner with the Welsh Referees Association. He is now a Tutor with the European Billiards and Snooker Association. He refereed his first World Ranking final in January 1998 at the Regal Welsh tournament in Newport, Monmouthshire where Paul Hunter won his first Ranking event title by defeating John Higgins by 9 frames to 5. He has since refereed many more Ranking finals including the Seniors Championship, Welsh Open Championship, Australian Goldfields Open, German Masters, UK Championship, Irish Masters, Wembley Masters, Malta Cup, China Masters, China Open, Thailand Open, British Open, Grand Prix, Bahrain Snooker Championship, World Open and four World Championship Finals at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield in 2001, 2005, 2007 and 2010. In November 2014, his retirement from the professional circuit was announced.

Written by Kevin Archer and Kevin Rowland, it was the band's second single and their first UK number one, staying at the top of the Singles Chart for two weeks. The song charted at number two in Ireland. Personnel *Kevin “Al” Archer: guitar, vocals *Geoff Blythe: saxophone *Andy Growcott: drums *Andy Leek: organ *“Big” Jim Paterson: trombone *Kevin Rowland: vocals *Pete Saunders: organ *Steve Spooner: alto saxophone *Pete Williams: bass  Composition  The song is a tribute to soul singer Geno Washington, and performed in approximately the style of Geno Washington's Ram Jam Band. Rowland and Archer began working on the song in early 1979, with Rowland writing lyrics to Archer's music. The song bears resemblance to Zoot Money's Big Roll Band's \\"One and Only Man\\" and the Turtles' \\"Happy Together\\". The \\"Geno! Geno! Geno!\\" chant at the beginning and end of the song (sampled from crowd noises on Van Morrison's acclaimed 1974 live album It's Too Late to Stop Now, a favourite of Rowland's) is reminiscent of Washington's 1960s performances, whereby the shows' compères would excite the audience before Washington took to the stage. The song's saxophone riff was inspired by Washington's \\"(I Gotta) Hold on to My Love\\", the B-side to \\"Michael (the Lover)\\".  Release and reception  EMI, the band's record label, wanted their recording of Johnny Johnson and the Bandwagon's \\"Breakin' Down the Walls of Heartache\\" to be released, feeling that \\"Geno\\" was only suitable as a B-side. The band refused, though the possibility of a double A-side was suggested. However, \\"Geno\\" was released (backed with \\"Breakin' Down the Walls of Heartache\\") on 15 March 1980. It slowly climbed the charts until it reached number 1 on 3 May. Record Mirror described \\"Geno\\" as \\"a turgid eulogy with few redeeming features\\", stating that they believed Dexys Midnight Runners had missed the opportunity to have the same success as Madness and the Specials. Similarly, Robbi Millar from Sounds wrote in March 1980 that \\"the most boring band of 1979 burst forth again with this erratic and timeless tribute to their hero, Geno Washington, who would probably keep his earplugs in if he heard it\\". \\"Geno\\" soon became a crowd favourite, with audiences chanting for the song throughout whole concerts. Pete Saunders said that the band found it best to play the song once at the beginning of the set, and once towards the end. The song is included in 1001 Songs You Must Hear Before You Die, where it is written that the song was inspired by Washington's \\"Michael (the Lover)\\" and subsequently inspired the Specials' \\"Ghost Town\\".

The Delta green ground beetle plays a useful role in its ecosystem by pollinating plants, fruits, and vegetables. The beetle's common name probably refers to the triangular marking on its pronotum. The species name, viridis, comes from the Latin word for green.\\"Species Elaphrus viridis - Delta green ground beetle\\". BugGuide. Retrieved on 14 August 2006. Range and distribution The Delta green ground beetle is known to only occur in Solano County, though it may have historically occurred throughout the Central Valley. It is known to inhabit Jepson Prairie Preserve, south of Dixon, where it is protected; however, the beetle's other known ranges are located on public land. The beetle occupies vernal pool habitats, around which its life cycle is based: it emerges in January following the filling of vernal pools from winter rains and lies dormant in May (around when the pools dry up) as a means of surviving the summer. Specimens of the Delta green ground beetle have generally been collected in open habitats, namely the edges of vernal pools and nearby trails, roads and ditches. They may also be present in the surrounding grasslands, but the beetle's small size, camouflage against spring grass, and tendency to hide beneath low growth make it difficult to locate. Reproduction The Delta green ground beetle breeds through January and September, with females producing one generation per year. Diet The Delta green ground beetle, in both its larval and adult stages, actively hunts soft- bodied arthropods. Based on the habits of other species of Elaphrus, it is likely that the beetle feeds primarily on springtails. Conservation status The Delta green ground beetle's current IUCN Red List status is Critically Endangered, owing to the species' extremely limited range and the endangerment of its vital vernal pool habitats. Database entry includes justification for why this species is listed as critically endangered. In addition, the species has been federally listed as threatened since 1980. The destruction of vernal pool habitats in California is largely the result of agricultural development, though urbanization and grazing have played some role in their elimination. Another significant threat to the beetle is the introduced Garden lippia, which grows in dense mats in these habitats and impairs its ability to forage.

The series is about a girl named Amy Fleming, who lives on a horse ranch called Heartland in Virginia, where she, family, and friends heal and help abused or mistreated horses. They attempt to help the abused horses by using psychologically based therapies instead of more traditional training methods. Throughout the series, the main character, Amy, finds healing along with the horses that she treats. Eventually, Amy is faced with tough decisions that put Heartland's future and fate in her hands. The target readership is ages 8 to 14. In 2007, a TV series based on the novels, but set in the Canadian province of Alberta, debuted in Canada on the CBC network.

After the death of her mother and the injuries of Amy in an accident during a storm when Amy and her mother went to rescue an abused horse they had named Spartan, Amy is challenged with both her runaway emotions and managing the equine sanctuary, Heartland, she calls home. With the help of her friends and family, she pulls through and decides to take over her mother's legacy. Her natural talent with horses helped her to cure and save many otherwise neglected animals, and despite the doubts of many, she stays strong to her beliefs. Over the years, her relationship with Ty, the stable hand, develops and they grow closer to each other. Amy faces hard challenges in her life, especially when it comes to deciding her future: college or Heartland. Amy has a brief cameo appearance in the Chestnut Hill series, also by Lauren Brooke. Jack Bartlett - Amy and Lou's grandfather. He is a kind, yet stubborn, man and often helps the girls with the horses and acts as a counselor to characters in the books. He helps the girls process their grief after their mother's death, and re-introduces Tim Fleming, Amy and Lou's father, into their life. Jack has never forgiven Tim for leaving Marion after his accident. Samantha Louise \\"Lou\\" Fleming-Trewin - Amy's 23-year-old sister. Lou is organized and runs the business side of Heartland after her mother's death. Amy looks up to Lou; she is practical and brave, like Tim. Lou is very close to her dad and they were inseparable during her childhood, and eventually adulthood. She marries Scott and has a daughter, Holly Marion. Ty Baldwin - The stable hand at Heartland, Ty dropped out of high school to pursue a permanent position at Heartland. He helps cure the horses. Ty is one of Amy's closest friends throughout the series, and eventually her boyfriend. He helps her through personal and professional challenges, and he often understands her when no one else can. Ty and Amy have a close relationship , and they become boyfriend & girlfriend later in the series. However, they break up when Amy leaves for college, but remain friends as of \\"A Winter's Gift\\". Scott Trewin - The local vet for Heartland. Scott agrees with Heartland's alternative methods of treating horses. He is also Matt's older brother. He marries Lou and thus is Amy's brother-in-law, as well as a half- brother-in-law to Lily, Tim's daughter with Helena. He and Lou have a daughter named Holly Marion. Soraya Martian - Amy's best friend since the 3rd grade. She helps Amy through hard times and, as a horse lover her herself, occasionally helps at Heartland as well as going on countless trail rides with Amy. During the series, she becomes romantically involved with Matt Trewin , and later, a boy named Anthony . Ashley Grant - Amy's rival in the series. Ashley's parents own Green Briar Stables, a stable for competition horses. Ashley often competes against Amy in jumping competitions. Perhaps as a result of her parents' constant pressure and high expectations, Ashley is extremely competitive and hostile towards Amy and her peers. Valerie \\"Val\\" Grant - The owner of Green Briar, Heartland's rival, Val is described as overbearing and snobby. Val believes in using very firm discipline- for example, whips and riding crops- on her horses; many of her students agree with her techniques. Val considers it a waste of time to develop a relationship with horses. Val schools her ponies to respond to the commands of any rider and her horses learn to \\"excel in one area and complete a course to win\\". Val, Ted and Ashley periodically attempt to shut Heartland down. Val is often an antagonist in the Heartland novels. Timothy \\"Tim\\" Fleming - Lou and Amy's father. Tim and Amy have not seen each other since Amy was 3, but their relationship evolves as the series progresses. He left Amy's mother and her family after he was hurt in a riding accident. Tim was paralysed in his accident; he is now in a wheel chair. After some time, Tim evidently began to regret leaving Marion, Amy and Lou. He found out where they were living and he sent a letter asking forgiveness, which Marion did not respond to. After Marion's death, he comes to visit Lou and Amy (\\"Thicker Than Water\\") and Amy finds out she is closer to her father than she thinks. He is now married to Helena and has another daughter, Lily. Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Stillman - Ben's aunt sent him to work at Heartland. However, he realized that he wanted to focus more on his riding skills than his skill with troubled horses. He went to work for Nick Halliwell along with Daniel. They both compete in riding, Ben with his horse, Red, and Daniel with Storm. Marion Bartlett-Fleming - Jack's daughter, a horse listener. Lou and Amy's mother and Tim's ex-wife. Heartland, and its alternative therapeutic methods, are described in the series as having been Marion's vision; Amy credits her knowledge of herbal remedies and training techniques to her mother. Marion dies in the beginning of the series from a trailer accident as she and Amy are trying to rescue an abandoned horse. Use of Alternative and Herbal Treatments Amy and the staff at Heartland are depicted over the course of the series using several alternative treatment methods for horses. One of the most common of these is the Bach flower essences, used to treat anxiety and induce calm. Amy also uses behavioral techniques to help skittish or abused horses; for example, \\"join-up\\" or \\"hooking on\\", a technique utilized by many natural horsemanship trainers. She is also periodically seen using massage and acupressure. One of the types of body work Amy uses is called Tellington TTouch, created by Linda Tellington- Jones. Amy uses other aspects of the Tellington Method to help horses learn to trailer safely, and to learn improved confidence on the ground and under saddle. Amy's references to physical characteristics of horses to analyze equine personality are based on Tellington-Jones' book \\"Getting in TTouch: Understand and Influence Your Horse's Personality.\\" References External links *Heartland at Scholastic Canada Novel series Series of children's books Novels set in Virginia Pony books ","title":"Heartland (novel series)"},{"id":"6460974","text":"Taenia may refer to: Anatomy * Taenia coli, three separate longitudinal ribbons of smooth muscle of the large intestine * Taenia thalami, a superior surface of the thalamus of the mammal brain * Taenia of fourth ventricle, two narrow bands of white matter of the mammal brain Zoology * Taenia (genus), a tapeworm genus * Cepola or Taenia, a bandfish genus * Tinea (moth) or Taenia, a fungus moth genus * Taenia, a Trichuridae roundworm genus * Taenia, a Scarabaeidae genus Other uses * Taenia (architecture), a small fillet molding near the top of the architrave in a Doric column * Tainia (costume) or Taenia, a ribbon worn in the hair in ancient Greece See also * Ribbon ","title":"Taenia"},{"id":"6460984","text":"Gold of the Seven Saints is a western film adaptation of a 1957 Steve Frazee novel titled Desert Guns. Released by Warner Brothers in 1961, the 88-minute film starred Clint Walker, Roger Moore, Letícia Román, Robert Middleton, and Chill Wills. It was directed by Gordon Douglas, who had earlier directed Walker in 1958's Fort Dobbs and 1959's Yellowstone Kelly. Leigh Brackett wrote the screenplay and Joseph F. Biroc provided the black-and-white photography, most of which was shot in and around Arches National Park in Utah. The film did not do notably well at the box office. Plot Two fur traders, Jim Rainbolt (Clint Walker) and Shaun Garrett (Roger Moore), stumble across a big gold strike. With the ruthless bandit McCracken (Gene Evans) and his men in relentless pursuit, they hide the gold behind a giant boulder. Shaun is wounded, but Doc Gates (Chill Wills) shows up out of nowhere and patches him up and is made a full partner. They take refuge at the ranch of Amos Gondora, an old friend of Jim's. There they are introduced to Gondora's so-called \\"ward\\", an Indian maiden called Tita (Letícia Román). That night some of McCracken's men stage a stampede and draw Jim and Gondora away. While they are gone, McCracken and some men ride up and take Shaun and Doc captive. He kills Doc because he is unable to tell the hiding place of the gold. Shaun does not know how to find the hiding place and even under torture cannot lead anyone to the gold. Rainbolt tracks and finds McCracken and his men. After a shootout, McCracken is the only one left of his gang, but he has a gun to Shaun's head and compels Rainbolt to lead him to the gold. When they get there, Rainbolt feigns being unable to move the boulder alone, drawing McCracken in close enough for Rainbolt to roll another boulder onto McCracken's leg, trapping him. Rainbolt and Garrett intend to leave McCracken there to die, but Gondora and his men show up. Everything seems all right until Gondora puts friendship aside and demands the gold for himself. Jim and Shaun run from them and must cross a rushing river to get away. The bags of gold fall apart and the gold is lost in the river where it came from. After they laugh at this turn of events, Gondora pledges his friendship again and Rainbolt and Garrett set out to return to their fur trapping.

Anne Meara played Veronica Rooney, a cook on Archie Bunker's Place from 1979–82. She often made wisecracks and gave Archie a hard time. She insisted that Archie also hire her openly gay nephew Fred as a waiter to help him pay for law school.

The material is high in organic matter, including charcoal, which gives it its characteristic dark colour; it may also contain fragments of pottery, tile, animal bone and other artefacts. It is interpreted as soil enriched with the sooty remains of thatched roofs from houses without chimneys, with other waste materials. In some areas it appears to give the soil added fertility. Restored blackhouse in a museum on Trotternish, Skye. There is no chimney on this house and the thatch becomes impregnated with soot. When the roof is replaced, the waste thatch can add fertility to the soil, resulting in dark earth. London's dark earth was originally called 'black earth' by archaeologists. It was renamed 'dark earth' because of confusion with the chernozem (black earth soils in Russia), whose dark colour is traditionally (not universally) thought to come from humus, rather than soot. Charred material as agricultural improver In the Hebrides, it was customary to remove the thatch from the \\"black houses\\" every spring, and spread it on the fields as fertilizer, improved by the soot which it retained. On Achill Island, special smoke huts were built in the fields, stone structures with sod roofs. From October to May smoky fires burned inside them, and in spring the sods were spread on the fields.The book of masonry stoves. David Lyle. Brick House Publishing Co, Inc. Andover, Massachusetts, 1984. (paperback edition) p.23 In the Amazon basin, there are very extensive areas of dark soil, known as terra preta, enriched by small particles of soot, and these areas are much more fertile than the natural soil.  Major areas   Roman Britain  In England, dark earth covers many areas that were built up in the Roman period, especially Londinium. In some cases, it may represent open spaces on the edge of urban centres, but can also be found in more rural settings in and around foci of settlement. In the example of London, deposits underlying the ancient city's dark earth are often dated to between the 2nd to 5th century, the middle and later Roman period. Overlying deposits are frequently dated to the 9th century when Saxon London was repopulated and began to expand. The dark earth shows little evidence of any depositional structure or 'horizons', although tip lines are sometimes recorded. Archaeologists have debated what London's dark earth layer may indicate about human use of the city. It has been taken as evidence of refuse disposal or gardening during the Roman period on the site of previous buildings. In this case it might be evidence of a decline of Londinium's population, or of its partial displacement outside the city walls. However, late Roman cemeteries around London do not show a population decline compared with earlier London. Alternatively, dark earth might have formed only after abandonment at the end of the Roman period. In this interpretation, dark earth would consist of urban deposits of smoke-impregnated thatch, decayed weeds, timber, and earth floors, reworked and homogenized by worm action, or by agricultural activities, such as ploughing, which mixed building materials from the abandoned Roman cities with material deposited later.  Sweden  In Sweden, dark earth covering has been found in Uppåkra, in Scania, southern Sweden, where a city-like settlement existed from about the year 1 until 1000 C.E. when the settlement shifted to modern day Lund. Dark earth over has been found in the Viking city of Björkö (today called Birka), in central Sweden, close to modern Stockholm. Dark earth has also been found in Köpingsvik, on the island of Öland close to the southern Sweden east coast.  West Africa  Dark earths occur around ruins in the :Upper Guinean forests of :Ghana, :Guinea, :Liberia and :Sierra Leone. For a period of at least 700 years, West African farmers have enriched the rain forest soils around their towns with compost derived from kitchen, animal, agricultural, and fire waste to produce a signature dark earth. Dark earth is part of the local nomenclature, economically important, and is used judiciously by local communities. The Loma and Mende peoples currently improve soil in this fashion. They well understand how this connects them to the durable legacy of fertile dark earth that encircles the ruined sites in the region. Locals associate the age of their own towns with the depth of their black soil.

Early life Penrose was born at Bracebridge, Lincolnshire, the third son of Rev. John Penrose who was vicar there, and his wife Elizabeth Cartwright. His mother was the daughter of Edmund Cartwright and was a teacher and author of children's books under the name Mrs Markham.

Penrose studied architecture under Edward Blore from 1835 to 1838, and studied abroad under the Cambridge designation of \\"travelling bachelor\\" from 1842 to 1845. In 1843 in Rome Penrose noticed a problem with the pitch of the roof of pediment of the Pantheon, and subsequent research confirmed that the angle had been changed from its original design. Penrose studied classical monuments in Greece taking and recording detailed measurements. He was one of the first people to discover the entasis of the Parthenon and to show the deliberate curvature of the steps and entablature. The Society of Dilettanti were interested in his discoveries and sent him back to Greece to confirm them.Royal Academy Collections In 1848 Penrose was made a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. He was appointed Surveyor of the Fabric of St Paul's Cathedral in 1852, and it was in this role that he did his main work.St Paul's Cathedral – F C Penrose project Penrose's work on the cathedral included the choir seats and the marble pulpit and stairs. He designed the memorial to Lord Napier of Magdala and the Wellington tomb in the crypt and arranged the relocation of the Wellington monument. He was also responsible for rearranging the West entrance steps and for exposing the remains of the old cathedral in the churchyard. The new premises for the cathedral's choir school in Carter Lane were built to his designs in 1874. It was as a result of a dispute with the Dean and Chapter that he became an astronomer. Penrose designed Holy Trinity parish church, Apperley, Gloucestershire, which was built in 1856. He also designed a west tower (shown here) and eastern apse that were added to the church in 1890.

A total of 83 (out of 266) Popes have been recognised universally as canonised saints, including all of the first 35 Popes (31 of whom were martyrs) and 52 of the first 54. If Pope Liberius is numbered amongst the Saints as in Eastern Christianity, all of the first 49 Popes become recognised as Saints, of whom 31 are Martyr-Saints, and 53 of the first 54 Pontiffs would be acknowledged as Saints. In addition, 13 other Popes are in the process of becoming canonised Saints: as of December 2018, two are recognised as being Servants of God, two are recognised as being Venerable, and nine have been declared Blessed or Beati, making a total of 95 (97 if Pope Liberius and Pope Adeodatus II are recognised to be Saints) of the 266 Roman Pontiffs being recognised and venerated for their heroic virtues and inestimable contributions to the Church. The most recently reigning Pope to have been canonised was Pope John Paul II, whose cause for canonisation was opened in May 2005. John Paul II was beatified on May 1, 2011, by Pope Benedict XVI and later canonised, along with Pope John XXIII, by Pope Francis on April 27, 2014.Pentin, Edward. \\"It’s Official: John Paul II and John XXIII to Be Canonized April 27\\", National Catholic Register, Oct 14, 2013 Pope Francis also canonised Pope Paul VI on October 14, 2018.

Spanish Florida established its Roman Catholic missionary system in the chiefdom in the late 16th century. During the late 17th century and early 18th century, Guale society was shattered by extensive epidemics of new infectious diseases and attacks by other tribes. Some of the surviving remnants migrated to the mission areas of Spanish Florida, while others remained near the Georgia coast. Joining with other survivors, they became known as the Yamasee, an ethnically mixed group that emerged in a process of ethnogenesis. \\"Guale\\" had been cited as one of the possible origins of the name of the Gullah people, a distinct Afro American ethnic group that emerged and was concentrated in much the same area where the Guale lived. The alternative name for Gullah, Gullah Geechee, has also been connected to the Ogeechee River, part of the Guale territory. Other scholars have theorized African origins for the words. Language Scholars have not reached a consensus on how to classify the Guale language. Early claims that the Guale spoke a Muskogean language were questioned by the historian William C. Sturtevant. He has shown that recorded vocabulary, which sources had believed to be Guale, was Creek, a distinct historical Muskogean language. Historical references note that the Jesuit Brother Domingo Agustín Váez recorded Guale grammar in 1569, but the documents have not been found. The Guale are believed to have been a Mississippian culture group. History Prehistory Archaeological studies indicate that the precursors of the historically known Guale lived along the Georgia coast and Sea Islands, from at least 1150 AD. Archaeologists identify the prehistoric Guale cultures as the Savannah phase (1150 to 1300 AD) and the Irene phase (1300 to circa 1600). While the prehistoric ancestors to the Guale shared many characteristics with regional neighbors, they left unique archaeological features that distinguished the \\"proto-Guale\\" people from other groups.Saunders (2000), The Guale Indians of the Lower Atlantic Coast, p. 27 The prehistoric people were organized into chiefdoms. They built Mississippian-type platform mounds, major earthworks requiring the organized labor of many people, and using highly skilled soil and engineering knowledge. They used the mounds for ceremonial, religious and burial purposes.Saunders (2000), The Guale Indians of the Lower Atlantic Coast, p. 30 European contact Guale Indian greets early settler French explorers under Jean Ribault contacted the Guale, whom they called the Oade after their chief, during their voyage to the Atlantic coast of North America in 1562. The Guale maintained good relations with the ephemeral French settlement known as Charlesfort on Parris Island in what is now South Carolina. When the Spanish later established themselves in St. Augustine in Spanish Florida, they also contacted the Guale. They soon tried to bring them into their mission system. The Guale territory became one of the four primary mission provinces of Spanish Florida; the Timucua, Mocama, and Apalachee Provinces, also named after the resident tribes of the territories, were the others. The boundaries of the Spanish Guale Province corresponded to the people's territory along the Atlantic coast and Sea Islands, north of the Altamaha River and south of the Savannah River. It included Sapelo, St. Catherine's, Ossabaw, Wassaw, and Tybee islands, among others. By the mid-17th century, the Spanish had established six Catholic missions in Guale territory. Their largest settlements were probably on St. Catherine's Island. Guale was the least stable of the four major mission provinces. The first Guale rebellion, often labeled Juanillo's Revolt, began on October 4, 1597. The Guale rebelled again 1645, nearly shaking off the missions. They kept up a clandestine trade with French privateers, which provided them with alternate sources of goods.Oatis (2004), A Colonial Complex, p. 24 La Tama and Yamasee amalgamation Indians throughout the American southeast were drawn to the Spanish mission provinces for their trade in European manufactured goods. Various non-Guale Indians settled in or near the Guale missions during the 17th century. Most were from an Indian province of north-central Georgia called La Tama by the Spanish. In the 1660s the well-armed Westo attacked La Tama and neighboring regions, dispersing the La Tama in several directions. Some migrated to the lower Chattahoochee River towns of Coweta and Cussita, the Apalachee mission provinces, and the Guale province. The La Tama spoke a dialect of Hitchiti, a Muskogean language, as did the Coweta, Cussita, and Apalachicola. The Guale language may or may not have been related.Oatis (2004), A Colonial Complex, p. 25 In 1675 the Spanish first used the term Yamasee to refer to the newcomer refugees. They thought them similar to the La Tama. In Guale Province, some of the Yamasee joined the existing missions, while others settled on the periphery. Destruction and dispersal Between 1675 and 1684, the Westo tribe, backed by the British colonial Province of Carolina and Colony and Dominion of Virginia, destroyed the Spanish mission system in Guale. Attacks by English-supported pirates also contributed to the breakup of the missions. In 1680 they sacked Mission Santa Catalina de Guale. By 1684 the Spanish and Indians had abandoned all six missions. The La Tama Yamasee, Guale, and other refugees scattered in the southeast. Some relocated to new missions in Spanish Florida, but most rejected Spanish authority. They felt Spain had been unable to protect them and resented their failure to provide firearms. The Indians of Guale Province moved mostly to the Apalachee or Apalachicola regions.Oatis (2004), A Colonial Complex, pp. 25–26 Emergence of the Yamasee Around or before 1684, one small group of Yamasee-Guale refugees, led by Chief Altamaha, moved north to the mouth of the Savannah River. That year, a Scottish colony called Stuarts Town was founded in South Carolina on Port Royal Sound near the Savannah River. Stuarts Town survived only about two years, but during that time the Scots residents formed a strong bond with the Yamasee-Guale. In late 1684, armed with Scots firearms, these Indians raided Timucua Province, devastating the mission Santa Catalina de Afuyca. They returned to Stuarts Town with 22 captives, whom they sold as slaves. Over the next two years, word of similar successes of the Stuarts Town-allied Yamasee-Guale carried throughout the region. The population of \\"Yamasee\\" Indians near Port Royal Sound grew rapidly. Although the Indians became known collectively as \\"Yamasee\\", the Guale continued to be a significant portion of the population.Oatis (2004), A Colonial Complex, p. 27 Spanish forces destroyed Stuarts Town. In the old Guale Province, they strongly resisted counterattacks by South Carolina. Nonetheless, the alliance between the Yamasee and colonial South Carolina grew stronger in reaction. The \\"Yamasee\\" who migrated in 1685 to the Port Royal area were rebuilding the old La Tama chiefdom, but they also included numerous Guale, as well as other Indians of mostly Muskogean stock. The Yamasee lived in South Carolina until they were defeated in the Yamasee War of 1715, after which survivors were widely dispersed and the people disintegrated as a polity. But while they lasted, the Yamasee exhibited multi- ethnic qualities. Their towns were described by the English as being Upper Yamasee or Lower Yamasee towns. The Lower Towns were populated mainly by La Tama Indians and included Altamaha (after the chief who lived there), Ocute, and Chechesee (Ichisi). The Guale were the majority in the Upper Towns, although other ethnicities were incorporated as well. Upper Yamasee Towns with mostly Guale populations likely included Pocotaligo, Pocosabo, and Huspah. Other Upper Towns, such as Tulafina, Sadketche (Salkehatchie), and Tomatley, were probably mixed, with Guale, La Tama, and others. It is possible that the La Tama had spent time in missions and become somewhat Christianized. They may have sought out the similarly missionized Guale., National Register Multiple Property Submission, Dr. Chester B. DePratter. In 1702 when British South Carolina forces invaded Spanish Florida, they destroyed the few \\"refugee missions\\" in Guale. By 1733, there were too few Guale in the area to resist James Oglethorpe's founding of the English colony of Province of Georgia. A similar missionary province called Mocama (named for a Timucuan chiefdom) was situated just south of Guale, on the coast between the Altamaha River and St. Johns River in Florida.

Lauderdale, Florida was officially opened in 1953 as an elementary school. The school is a part of the Broward County Public Schools district. Originally for white students only, In 1963 Chester Seabury became the first African-American to graduate from a white high school in Florida when he graduated from Stranahan. The school was built on land donated by Ivy Julia Cromartie Stranahan, and was named after her late husband Frank Stranahan. The school progressively added the junior high school grades a year at a time due to rapid population growth in the area. The school opened as a high school in 1957. The first principal of Stranahan was Kenneth Dale Haun. Kenneth Haun had been a Junior High Assistant Principal when he was picked to help design and then serve as principal of Stranahan. As the school added grades each year and then gradually dropped the middle school grades, Kenneth Haun continued as head of the school. He served as principal for nearly thirty years.Haun, CD son of Kenneth Haun The school's unique design of separate buildings spread out more like a college campus was a result of limited funds to build the school. Buildings were gradually added in phases to accommodate growth of the student population. The first hall building was converted to a 2-story building in the 1970s. During renovations of first hall in the early 90s, there was a large fire that consumed most of the building. The building was renovated and it now contains the administration on the first floor and the second floor has English and social studies classrooms. The second hall has computer labs and foreign language classrooms. Third hall has art classrooms and fourth hall has math. The magnet classrooms are mostly in the new science and medical magnet buildings. Previously some of the magnet classrooms were located in second and third hall. The current principal is Michelle Padura. Stranahan High has an FCAT school grade of \\"B\\" for the 2013 academic year.FCAT School Grades - High  Overview  Stranahan High School has two magnet programs dedicated to engineering and medical sciences. The magnet program's first graduating class was in 1997. It received a Gates Grant in 2005 and has begun a transition to small learning communities. The present community serving 9th grade students is CREST. Tenth through 12th grade students may choose among communities dedicated to business (downtown community), the arts (the studio community), technology and engineering (Sci- Tech community) or health related careers (the health pavilion community). In 2007 Stranahan was recognized by the College Board as one of three high schools in the nation to receive an \\"Inspiration Award\\" for outstanding achievement in minority student participation in Advanced Placement classes. It was also recognized by Newsweek magazine as one of the top 500 high schools in the country. According to the Florida Department of Education classification, Stranahan High School is ranked an \\"C\\" school. Attendance zone The school serves sections of Fort Lauderdale and Davie.  Compare this map to attendance boundary maps and/or street addresses of particular schools.  Compare with the Davie zoning map.  Medical Magnet  Students in the Medical Magnet program will be given specialized classes that are designed to inform them of general aspects of the medical field. Some of these classes include medical research, biotechnology, genetics, and forensics. Students are also encouraged in the Medical Magnet program to take Anatomy and Physiology versus physics, and also include special classes such as Health Science. Students in their 12th grade year are given the opportunity to travel to Broward General Hospital in order to observe different departments and also become interactive with doctors, nurses, or any staff.

The temporal scales usually number 2+3, sometimes 2+4, but very rarely 2+2 or 3+3. There are 6 supralabial scales, very rarely 7. The sublabial scales usually number 7 or 10, rarely 8, and very rarely 11, 12 or 13. The first 3-4 sublabials are in contact with the anterior chin shields. The posterior chin shields are small and often indistinguishable from the gulars. At midbody there are 15-21 rows of dorsal scales that are moderately keeled and have a satiny texture. The ventral scales number 120-166, the subcaudals, most of which are divided, 15-36. The color pattern consists of a ground color that is usually some shade of brown (possibly pinkish or grayish-brown), but occasionally olive green. This is overlaid with a pattern of 20-30 rhombic blotches that have pale edges, as well as a sprinkling of black scales and oblique black bars on the sides. Each oblique black bar is topped by one or two black spots, each with a pale centre, and strongly resembling an eye. Northern populations may be patternless, making them difficult to identify, while in others the pale edges may be missing, the rhombic blotches may be a darker color, or there may even be a dark brown vertebral stripe. The head has a characteristic V-shaped mark that may be solid black, or brown with a black outline. Common names Rhombic night adder, demon night adder, Cape night adder, African night adder, Cape viper.U.S. Navy. 1991. Poisonous Snakes of the World. US Govt. New York: Dover Publications Inc. 203 pp. . Geographic range Savannas of subsaharan Africa from Nigeria east to Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya, south through Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, DR Congo, Angola, Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, northern Botswana, Mozambique, Swaziland, and eastern South Africa to Riverdale in the Western Cape Province. No type locality is listed. Behavior This is an active species that can often move relatively quickly—up to an estimated speed of 92 cm per second (3 feet per second). They are usually found on the ground, but have no trouble climbing or swimming. They are largely nocturnal, but are often seen basking in the early morning or late afternoon. However, Harper (1963) reported collecting a dozen specimens that were all active during the heat of the day. Most specimens are docile, seldom attempting to bite unless severely provoked. FitzSimons is quoted in Pitman (1938) as saying that, in captivity, they \\"become so tame that you may allow them to creep, climb and slither round your neck and inside your garments.\\" Others, however, are more temperamental. When seriously disturbed, they will put on a \\"ferocious\\" threat display that includes coiling up, inflating the body (making the dark markings stand out), hissing and puffing loudly, flattening the anterior portion of the body, and striking frantically. They may also flatten the neck and move forward with the tongue extended, much like a small cobra. Striking is done with such vigor that small specimens may lift themselves off the ground entirely. Feeding A rhombic night adder eating a frog in Mlilwane Wildlife Sanctuary, Swaziland The diet consists mainly of toads, but it also includes frogs and small mammals.Mehrtens JM. 1987. Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . Reproduction Females produce an average clutch of two dozen eggs that require a lengthy incubation period of approximately four months. The hatchlings are 10-12.5 cm (4-5 inches) in total length and feed on tiny frogs and toads. Venom Rhombic Night Adder bites can be very serious and in at least one bite a child had to have a fasciotomy. The few documented bites involved pain and minor swelling with minimal necrosis. These symptoms usually disappear within 2–3 days. There have been no modern well-documented cases to back up earlier claims of fatalities due to bites from this species. Venom yield has varied from 20–30 mg to 300 mg, but the venom toxicity is low with values of 10.8, 14.6, >16.0 mg/kg IV and 15 mg/kg SC being reported.

In keeping with the traditions of the militaries of most nations, the rank varies between the services, being a senior rank in the naval services and a junior rank in the ground and air forces. Many fire departments and police departments in the United States also use the rank of Captain as an officer in a specific unit. Usage For the naval rank, a captain is a senior officer of U.S. uniformed services pay grades O-6 (the sixth officer rank), typically commanding seagoing vessels, major aviation commands and shore installations. This rank is used by the U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps, and the U.S. Maritime Service. Seaborne services of the United States and many other nations refer to the officer in charge of any seagoing vessel as \\"captain\\" regardless of actual rank. For instance, in the civilian United States Merchant Marine, the commander of a vessel is also referred to as a captain, and everyone in his boat must abide by his commands. While not an official rank, as in military pay grade, it is an official title. One exception to the rule is when an officer of higher rank than captain, such as admiral, is the officer in charge of one or more seagoing vessel(s), such as a carrier battle group. An admiral is never referred to as \\"captain\\". In the seaborne services, especially for submarine and aviation commands, the commanding officer is often referred to informally as \\"skipper\\" whether the officer is a captain or below. For the ground and air forces rank, a captain is of pay grade O-3 (the third officer rank), usually serving as the commander of a company-sized unit in the ground forces, as a flight leader or other squadron officer in air units, or serving as an executive officer or staff officer for a larger unit such as a battalion or squadron. This rank is used by the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, and U.S. Marine Corps. The rank of captain is also used in other organizations outside the military, particularly in fire departments, police, and law enforcement.

During the American Civil War, the rank of captain was used in both the Union Army and Confederate States Army. The rank was typically held by either junior staff officers or company commanders. In the case of the latter, company officers were normally elected by the men of their unit, unless the officer in question held rank in the Regular Army. In cases where regiments had suffered high casualties, it was not uncommon for a captain to assume duties as the regimental commander. Such was the case in the 1st Mississippi Infantry which was commanded by Captain Owen Hughes after the regiment had lost over half its number at the Battle of Nashville. US Army O3.svgU.S. Army Union army cpt rank insignia.jpgU.S. Army Rank equivalency between services Because of the ambiguity created by the common use of \\"captain\\" for officers of different grades among the Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Navy, NOAA, Public Health Service, and Space Force, equivalency is conferred between officers by use of identical pay grade rather than title of rank. The higher the grade, the higher the rank of the officer. For example, an Army, Air Force, Marine, or Space Force captain is equivalent in rank, responsibilities, and grade to a Navy, Public Health Service, NOAA, or Coast Guard lieutenant, all of which are of the third officer grade, or O-3. Similarly, a Navy, Public Health Service, NOAA, or Coast Guard captain is equivalent in rank, responsibilities, and grade to an Army, Air Force, Marine, or Space Force colonel, all of which are of the sixth officer grade, or O-6. Thus, Army, Air Force, Marine, and Space Force colonels together with Navy, Public Health Service, NOAA, and Coast Guard captains wear the silver eagle insignia of the grade of O-6, while Army, Air Force, Marine, and Space Force captains together with Navy, Public Health Service, and Coast Guard lieutenants wear the double silver bars of the rank insignia of the grade of O-3. Additionally, the O-6 rank of Navy, Public Health Service, NOAA, and Coast Guard captain is abbreviated as uppercase \\"CAPT\\", while the O-3 rank of captain is abbreviated as \\"CPT\\" for the Army and mixed-case \\"Capt\\" for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Space Force. Early history In the United States, the rank of captain first appeared in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. A captain was the officer placed in charge of a company of soldiers and was granted a commission from the regimental colonel. A captain was afforded one to several lieutenants, depending on the size of the company, and the captain's commission could be revoked or expired at the end of a particular military campaign. The Continental Navy used the rank of captain as the commander of a sailing vessel at war, with the captain having several lieutenants on board, as well as a sailing master to assist in their duties. This use of the rank carried over into the U.S. Navy. With the addition of the ranks of commander and lieutenant commander between lieutenant and captain, a Navy captain became equivalent in rank to an Army colonel.

Glock (September 14, 1925 – January 19, 1992) was an American archaeologist working in Palestine, where he was murdered. Glock was born in Gifford, Idaho. His parents were deeply religious Lutherans of German ancestry living in Illinois. Albert Glock studied at several universities, graduating in 1950 at Concordia Seminary and receiving master's degree from the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago in 1963. In 1951 he married Lois Sohn, and he served as pastor in Normal, Illinois, for several years.Edward Fox, Palestinian Twilight, He enrolled at the University of Michigan to pursue his studies under the biblical scholar George E. Mendenhall, who believed the Biblical account of an Israelite invasion of Canaan was incorrect, and that what actually must lie behind the biblical version was a kind of theocratic peasants' revolt from within Canaan.Edward Fox, Palestinian Twilight Glock, as a Lutheran missionary, came to Palestine in 1962 to work on excavations of Taanach, an ancient Canaanite city in south of Jezreel Valley. Raised to believe that every word of the Bible was 'inerrant', he is described by Sari Nusseibeh as settling down, at Birzeit, to swap a religious crusade for Palestinian nationalism.Sari Nusseibeh, Once Upon a Country Halban Books, London (2007) 2009 p.157 He had spent 17 years in Jerusalem and the West Bank, first as a director of the Albright Institute for Archaeology and then as head of the archaeology department of Birzeit University, where he helped to found the Archaeology Institute. He was particularly dedicated to a lifelong project of excavating Ti'inik. On January 19, 1992 Glock was shot, on the eve of his retirement, which he hoped to spend in Beit Hanina, when going to work in the West Bank. Neither reason for the murder nor who did it was reliably identified. His family and most Palestinians thought Israel was responsible, while Israel blamed it on Arab hit men. Witnesses said the getaway car had Israeli license plates. When his wife called Israeli police, they showed up after a delay of 4 hours and showed little interest in investigating the murder scene. Glock's family hired a private investigator who told Sari Nusseibeh that Israeli police had arrested a Palestinian American at Ben Gurion airport, who was linked to Hamas and a terrorist cell run by Adel Awadallah. The man reportedly confessed under interrogation that Awadallah had personally assassinated Glock.Nusseibeh, pp.367-368.

In October 2014, all access to Long Island was cut off for the indefinite future by then Mayor of Boston, Marty Walsh, based on the warning of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation that the bridge was unsafe. All those living on Long Island and being serviced by recovery programs or who were guests in the homeless shelter were no longer able to get there. They were abruptly relocated elsewhere on an emergency basis.Abel, David, \\"On Long Island, haunting signs of a hasty departure: The pieces left behind at island’s shelters highlight uncertainty\\", The Boston Globe, October 28, 2014 The bridge to Long Island was demolished on March 23, 2015.Schworm, Peter, \\"Long Island Bridge Demolition Continues\\", The Boston Globe, March 23, 2015 The future uses of the island and its buildings are still under discussion. History Seventeenth century At the beginning of the American colonial period, Long Island was used and populated by Native American Indians. On April 1, 1634, the island was granted to the City of Boston along with Deer Island and Hogg Island (now Orient Heights in East Boston). The rent for these three islands was set at two pounds per year. This grant was confirmed on March 4, 1635, when Spectacle Island was added to the package and the annual rent was reduced to four shillings per year for all four islands. The Town of Boston leased Long Island to thirty-seven tenant farmers for farming and for the felling of trees. Wood was a much needed commodity in this period since it was the main fuel used for cooking and heating of houses in Boston. Long Island derived its name from its length—a mile and three-quarters long and a quarter mile wide. William Wood in his New England Prospect reported that this isle abounds in wood, water, meadow ground, and fertile ground. He also noted that local farmers put their rams, goats, and swine here for safety during the corn growing season. On February 24, 1640, the Boston Town Meeting ordered that Long Island be laid out into lots for farming starting at the eastern point on the island. On September 28, 1641, the Right-Honorable William, Earl of Stirling, filed an ownership claim for Long Island. His colonial agent, John Forest, recorded the Earl's claim against Edward Tomlin and others as intruders on Long Island. This claim was proven baseless by the Court in Boston. On April 19, 1649, the Court in Boston levied an annual rent of 6 pence per acre on the farms on Long Island with payment due on February 1 each year. The proceeds from these rents were slated for the support of the free school in Boston. Because the Long Island tenants refused to pay these rents, in 1655, Boston officials sent a constable out to the island to make the necessary collections. On March 11, 1667, the Town of Boston deeded the farms on Long Island to the tenants with the stipulation that they pay up their back rent. By this act, the land on Long Island first passed into private hands. In 1672, Joseph and Elizabeth Rock purchased on Long Island with a mortgage which they paid off by August 9, 1672. The deed described their property as having houses, outhouses, barns, stables, wharfs, yards, orchards, gardens, meadows, pastures, and fishing rights. In the 1670s during King Philip's War, Christian \\"praying Indians\\" were moved from Marlborough and Natick under the auspices of John Eliot, the minister of Roxbury, mostly to Deer Island, but at least one colony was sent to Long Island.cf. Winsor and Jewett, \\"The Memorial History of Boston\\" , 1880, pp.320-1. > Another colony of friendly Indians and prisoners were afterwards sent to > Long Island, in the harbor. On October 6, 1676, during the panic caused by King Philip's War, Massachusetts residents collected all of the local Native American population from the surrounding towns and herded them to a dock in Watertown on the Charles River. Here, they were loaded on barges and transported to Deer Island where they were abandoned. Through the freezing winter, the Indians' main sustenance was fish and clams taken along the shore and mud flats of the island. No barracks or other housing were provided, and only a scanty thicket on the lee side of the hills protected them from easterly winds. Thousands of Native Americans are presumed to have been marooned on Deer Island that winter; however, only the converted (praying) Indians were counted and recorded. Hundreds of Indians perished of starvation and exposure during the winter of 1676–77. Old Ahatton and other chiefs petitioned the Court in Boston for the rights to visit other islands in Boston Harbor to harvest clams and fish because his people were starving to death. In the Spring of 1677, the surviving Indians were allowed to cross over to Long Island. On April 19, 1689, John Nelson, a resident of Long Island, led Bostonians in a revolt against Governor Sir Edmund Andros, culminating in the Battle of Fort Hill Downst, Henry P., \\"Random Notes of Boston\\", Humphrey Publishing, ca. 1916, Chapter 5, \\"Waterfront and Harbor\\". > It is said that the battle of Fort Hill, between the soldiers and the > townsmen, was precipitated by the term \\"lobster,\\" applied to a red-coat, by > one of the mechanics.

Governor Andros had rescinded the Massachusetts Charter and all previous laws and contracts that had been negotiated or enacted in the Massachusetts Colony. During 1690, John Nelson bought all of the property from the tenants on Long Island with the exception of owned by Thomas Stanberg, a shopkeeper from Boston. Stanberg was one of the original tenants on Long Island. Nelson was well connected politically being a close relative of Sir Thomas Temple, and the husband of Elizabeth Stoughton, the niece of Governor William Stoughton. On June 4, Nelson mortgaged his Long Island property to William and Benjamin Browne from Salem, Massachusetts, for 1,200 pounds. Henry Mare managed the Brownes' house and land on Long Island. In 1692, John Nelson was captured by the French while on a privateering voyage. He was imprisoned in Quebec. It was common for local privateers to receive commissions in Boston but be considered pirates by the other nations of the world—especially the French and Spanish who were the superpowers at the time. While in prison, Nelson learned about secret French plans for attacks against the Massachusetts colonies. Nelson secretly informed the Massachusetts authorities from his prison cell. For this act, Nelson was punished by being transported across the Atlantic Ocean to the Bastille Prison in France. In 1702, after ten years of imprisonment, Sir Purbeck Temple obtained John Nelson's release. Nelson immediately returned home to Nelson's Island (Long Island) as a local hero.\\"The Islands of Boston Harbor\\", in \\"Some Events of Boston and Its Neighbors\\", Chapter 4, printed for the State Street Trust Company, Boston, Massachusetts, 1917. > Long Island was so called because it is the longest island in the harbour. > In 1847 a company bought all of it except the east end upon which was the > lighthouse, and then built a wharf and a hotel and laid out streets.

Eighteenth century On December 7, 1708, Benjamin Browne, one of the mortgagers of Nelson's Island, died, passing control of the island to his brother, William Browne, who died on February 23, 1716. John Nelson died on December 5, 1721. On September 24, 1724, the land-deed given from John Nelson to the Brownes was declared a mortgage and was annulled by a legal instrument executed by Colonel Samuel Brown, who acted as executor for the Brownes. The ownership of Nelson's Island had reverted to Nelson's heirs in seven parts. Two parts went to John and Mary Nelson, heirs of the oldest son, Temple Nelson. One share went to Nathaniel Hubbard by his wife, Elizabeth Nelson. One part went to Henry Lloyd by his wife, Rebecca Nelson. Another part went to John Steed by his wife, Margaret Nelson, and one part went to Robert Temple by his wife, Mehitable Nelson. Robert Nelson bought up an additional four shares. Robert Temple and the other owners sold the whole of Nelson's island to Charles Apthorp, a merchant from Boston. The deed described the island as containing of land, single houses, buildings, barns, stables, orchards, gardens, pastures, fences, trees, woods, underwoods, swamps, marshes, meadows, arable land, ways, water courses, easements, commons, common pasture, passages, stones, beach, flats, immunites, commodies, heriditaments, emoulants, and apportances. The name used for the island changed to Apthorp's Island at this time, although both names are found in various records. Charles Apthorp died on November 18, 1758, at 60 years of age. His heirs sold the island to Barlow Trecothick, later an alderman and Lord Mayor of London. Trecothick had married Grizzell Apthorp, the oldest daughter of Charles Apthorp and Grizzell Eastwicke Apthorp. American Revolutionary War During the Revolutionary times in 1768, the occupying British forces used Long Island for grazing their sheep, cattle, and swine. The British also harvested the hay from this island's meadows as feed for their horses in Boston. On July 12, 1775, Colonel John Greaton with a detachment of 500 American soldiers, in 65 whaleboats, raided Long Island where they \\"liberated\\" all the sheep and cattle grazing there, and captured 17 British sailors who were guarding the animals. British men-of-war, when alerted about the raid, fired at the whaleboats. A British schooner, towing barges loaded with armed marines, chased the American whaleboats back to their encampment in Squantum and Dorchester. One American soldier was killed on Moon Island. Moon Island was not connected to Squantum at this time and a waterway was open from behind Squantum (Squaw Rock) across the mouth of the Neponset River to a large rock called Savin Hill. On Sunday, March 17, 1776, British ships evacuated Boston under pressure from George Washington's forces on the heights on Dorchester (now South Boston). Abigail Adams, from her vantage point in a part of Braintree that is now Quincy, described the sight of the myriad masts of the British fleet as like a forest in the harbor. On board the British ships were 11,000 soldiers and sailors and 1019 self-exiled citizens of Boston, including 102 civil officers, 18 clergymen and 105 loyalists from the country towns. Instead of immediately departing the Boston Harbor area, the British ships anchored in the outer harbor and continued the blockage of Boston Harbor for the next three months, which was a cause of great concern in Boston and the surrounding towns. British Commodore Banks on his 28-gun \\"Milford\\" and several other men-of-war commanded the blockading British fleet. As the blockade persisted, Abigail Adams was quite outspoken about the delay by the Boston authorities in removing the British blockade from the outer harbor. During June, fierce artillery battles were waged between the British ships and American shore batteries that were entrenched on the harbor islands. The embarrassment from her remarks may have triggered the following actions: On June 13, 1776, American General Ward ordered Colonel Asa Whitcomb and 500 cannoneers with a mortar and two field cannons to the East Head of Long Island, while similar emplacements were set up on Hull. This installation was named, \\"Long Island Battery.\\" At a signal from their commander, Brig. General Benjamin Lincoln, both batteries opened fire on the British fleet. When the British flagship, \\"Milford\\" was hit, Commander Banks ordered the rest of the British fleet to sea. During the confusion created by the cannonading by American artillerymen from East Head on Long Island and from the Hull Batteries, two American privateers attacked the British transport, \\"Arbella,\\" that was loaded with rich supplies and Scottish Highlander troop replacements. The Arbella was on an approach to Boston Harbor and beat off the initial attack, escaping up Nantasket Roads into the channel off the East Head of Long Island. Obviously, this British transport did not get the word about the evacuation of Boston. Captain Tucker's Marblehead, Massachusetts privateer took up the chase from Broad Sound along with an armed vessel from Rhode Island that approached the Arbella from the east side of Long Island. They found that the Arbella had grounded but was still able to fight, as her guns shattered Tucker's spars and riddled his ship's sails and Pine Tree Flag. The transport then turned and drove the Rhode Island privateer around the west side of Long Island. The fight continued until the British ship struck her colors. British captain Major Menjies and 36 men were killed during the battle. The slain Highlanders were buried on Long Island in a solemn procession led by Scottish bagpipers. The wives of the dead soldiers who had accompanied their husbands on this trip marched in the funeral procession. The rich cargo of military stores was quickly moved to Cambridge to help support the American army that was encamped there. On July 17, 1776, about a month after the British were driven from the outer harbor, the Long Island Battery on East Head fired a thirteen-gun salute in celebration and honor of the promulgation of the Declaration of Independence. Similar salutes were fired from the other batteries throughout Boston Harbor. Edward Rowe Snow related a story about a Mary, the wife of a Tory, William Burton, who was aboard one of the British ships that formed the blockade on Boston Harbor, together with her husband. A cannonball from the Long Island Battery struck Mary. As she lay dying, she pleaded with her husband not to bury her at sea. A flag of truce was struck that allowed Burton to go ashore with his wife's body. Mary Burton was buried on East Head after her body was sewn into a red blanket. One of the Americans agreed to put her name on a grave marker. Her husband planned to return to Boston but never did. Over the years, the wooden marker rotted away. People who knew this story erected a stone cairn over the burial site. In 1804, some fishermen were wrecked on Long Island and they took refuge in an old powder magazine. As they were building a fire, they were startled by a moan coming over the hill near Mary Burton's cairn. The stunned fishermen claimed to have seen a form of a woman wearing a scarlet cloak coming over the hill. Blood appeared to be streaming down the cloak from a wound in her head. The ghost just kept on walking by the fishermen and soon disappeared over the hill. Again, during the War of 1812, a \\"woman in scarlet\\" was reported at Fort Strong. Also, in 1891, Private William Liddell reported seeing a \\"woman in scarlet.\\" Liddell, while on guard duty at night, reported that that ghost came toward him from an easterly direction emitting distinct moans. Barlow Trecothick, the owner of Long Island, died on May 28, 1775, and the island passed to his brother-in-law, Charles Ward Apthorp from New York (died 1796). Apthorp sold the island on June 13, 1791, to James Ivers of Boston. Around this time, the island began to be officially called Long Island. In 1794, a lighthouse was built on the northern head of the island, replaced by a bigger tower in 1819. It was later relocated to fit in with coastal fortifications. Early nineteenth century In 1814, during the War of 1812, the Massachusetts authorities requested that Commodore Bainbridge move the new ship, \\"Independence\\" and the frigate, \\"Constitution\\" down the harbor so that the British could capture them, hoping to avoid having the British shell the City of Boston. Bainbridge refused and suggested that Long Island be fortified to keep the British from entering Boston Harbor. James Ivers died in Boston on June 13, 1815, at 88 years of age. Long Island legally passed to Ivers' two daughters, Hannah, the wife of Jonathan Austin, and Jane, wife of Benjamin Austin. In 1818, a committee from the Boston Marine Society investigated the need for a lighthouse on Long Island Head, acting on a request from the Portland (Maine) Marine Society. This lighthouse would be designed to help vessels navigating into Boston Harbor through the Broad Sound Channel. Another committee of five selected a suitable site for a lighthouse in April 1819. The first lighthouse built on Long Island Head was constructed on the eastern side of Long Island Head. The finished light was a rubble stone and granite tower. The lantern was positioned about above MHW-Mean High Water. (The height of a light is measured from MHW to the focal plane of the light source or bulb. The light's characteristic was a fixed white beam generated from nine burners and reflectors with a visibility of about . This light, called the \\"Inner Harbor Light\\", was the second lighthouse established in Boston Harbor. The first light keeper was Jonathan Lawrence. The needed for this first lighthouse had to be acquired by the Federal Government by a lawsuit. The \\"Inner Harbor Light\\" was first lighted in October 1819. The lighthouse property was surrounded by fortifications located along the edge of the cliff. Jonathan Lawrence, who was the first lightkeeper at Long Island Light, died in the Light Service in 1825. Charles Beck, the second light keeper ran a signal system from Long Island Head in 1825. Beck hoisted a black ball to indicate when more pilots were needed down the harbor. This signal system remained active until 1851. An 1830 commentary described Long Island as the most pleasant place in Boston Harbor and predicted that it would be a great area for a summer resort. The article also noted that a hotel, erected by the Long Island Company, was commodious and convenient. Much of Long Island was being used for pasture in more recent years. Unfortunately, by 1840, the popularity of Long Island faded over the previous ten years and there was only one farmhouse reported on the island. In 1843, J.W.P. Lewis, a civil engineer, reported that the light tower was leaky and the walls were cracked from frost heaves. Lewis also indicated that the light was not positioned correctly for its intended purpose. The light fixture reflected with a cast the light in six different directions. He described the lantern as being made of the rudest materials and as being obstructed by the framework that supported the covering for the light. Lewis inspected most lighthouses in New England during 1843. In 1844, a new cast-iron lighthouse was constructed on Long Island Head. This was the second lighthouse built on the Head. It appears to be the first cast-iron lighthouse constructed in the United States. The South Boston Iron Company performed the work. This lighthouse was cast in sections of about seven feet in height and twelve feet in diameter at the base. It was furnished with an iron deck providing a twenty-inch walkway around the lantern. The deck had a railing. A cast iron circular staircase on the interior led to the lantern room. The lantern was made of upright wrought iron bars to receive the glass with sixteen 48\\" x 16\\" side over which was a cast iron dome with a cast-iron pipe in the center that served as a smoke flue for the lighthouse's stove. On October 1, 1847, the Ivers' heirs sold Long Island to Thomas Smith of Cohasset, Massachusetts. The East Head, where the lighthouse was located, was not included in this sale. Long Island was on the verge of being developed, but an ominous rumor about a pending takeover by the City of Boston for its various institutions made this real estate undesirable to investors. The use of this island as a military post precluded any recreational expansion and development. On May 1, 1849, Long Island was purchased from Thomas Smith and was incorporated by the Long Island Company. At this time, the only inhabitants were George Smith, a farmer, and Nicolas Capello, a Portuguese fisherman. Over the next 35 years, the heirs of Nicholas Capello and other friends increased the population of Long Island to over thirty families clustering in an area called \\"Portuguese Village\\". Their huts and a fleet of fishing boats were located just below East Head.Boston Island factsheet on Long Island The Long Island Company built the Long Island House and the Long Island Hotel in the center of the island as part of a project to develop recreational facilities on the island. A Colonel Mitchell was the proprietor of the Long Island Hotel. This hotel was described as a \\"splendid hotel, large and accommodating, constructed in the form of a Greek Cross and located in the center of the island on the west side\\". Colonel Mitchell was known as being welcoming, benevolent, and gentlemanly. The Eutaw House was also constructed at this time.Snow, Edward Rowe, \\"Sailing Down Boston Bay\\", p.23, has a picture of Eutaw House, on Long Island, from 1856. The Long Island Company drew up plans to subdivide Long Island into many small lots and envisioned a large new community. \\"Pleasure\\" or vacation brochures of Boston Harbor described the Long Island House as a \\"large white hotel.\\" The rest of the island was meadows and grazing field. Many of the trees were long since felled for firewood by early settlers. In 1855, the second Long Island Light was refitted and repositioned into a square enclosure on the wastop of the Head. A good fresh- water was added and a comfortable, stone lightkeepers house was built. The remains of an old military fortifications formed the north and west side of the lighthouse enclosure. The new light was fitted with a Fourth Order Fresnel lens that exhibited a fixed white light and was located where it was visible toward Broad Sound. This light served as part of a range in conjunction with Bug Light on the end of Brewster Spit at the edge of the Narrows Channel. Vessels approaching Boston from the southeast would align these lights to stay clear of Hardings Ledge off Nantasket Beach. Bug Light was constructed in 1856 and showed a fixed red light. In 1858, a lighthouse Inspector's reports indicated that the lighthouse keeper's house on Long Island had two bedrooms, a parlor, a sitting room, and a kitchen. American Civil War In 1860, control of the Long Island Company was transferred to Thomas J. Dunbar of Boston. The plan to develop this island was thwarted by the rumors of war and plans for military installations on Long Island Head and other parts of the island. Camp Wightman was established on Long Island. The Commander was General Devens who used the Long Island House as his headquarters building. This military post was named after Mayor Wightman of Boston. On April 17, 1861, the 3rd Massachusetts Regiment departed Long Island along with the 4th Massachusetts Regiment, sailing to Fort Monroe, Virginia. These famous regiments were credited with destroying the navy yard at Norfolk, Virginia, and fought the Virginians at Hampton. On their return from the South, the 3rd Massachusetts Regiments were mustered out after four days in camp here. The men of the 4th Massachusetts Regiment were the first northern troops to march on Virginia soil during the Civil War. They also fought at Big Bethel. The 4th Massachusetts Regiment was also mustered out at Camp Wightman on Long Island. In 1863, Camp Wightman had over 1,000 recruits in addition to several full batteries of heavy artillery under the command of General Devens. The military reservation was located on the slope between the Portuguese Village near the southeast beach and the summit beyond the Long Island House. The steamer \\"Bellingham\\" was the conscript boat for Fort Wightman on Long Island. Post- Civil War During 1865, P.B. Small was reported as the light keeper on Long Island Light. In this year, the schooner Joseph Fish, carrying of petroleum, was rammed by another vessel while at anchor near Long Island. Light Keeper Small reported that the Joseph Fish caught fire and was totally destroyed. 1888 German map of Boston Harbor showing Long Island in the lower right hand corner. It marks a lighthouse (\\"Leuchtturm\\") and hotel on the island. In 1867, the Federal Government acquired the east head section of Long Island by an act of Congress, and Fort Strong was moved to Long Island from Noddle's Island (East Boston). The fort has been reported to be named after Major General George C. Strong, who was killed at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, in 1863. History has shown that Fort Strong existed in 1815 on Noddle's Island. Later sources write that the fort was re-dedicated and named for the Governor of Massachusetts, Caleb Strong.Snow, Edward Rowe, \\"Sailing Down Boston Bay\\", p.24. Military use of Long Island had been started again during the Civil War when the island was a camp for conscripts and armament was installed. In the early Endicott Period, the defenses were modernized but were not subsequently used. On September 8, 1869, a tremendous storm (most likely a hurricane) hit the Boston Harbor area. The chimney on the light keeper's house at Long Island Light was knocked off and damaged the roof. Lightning struck and damaged the boathouse that was located just below the lighthouse on the western side of the island. In 1870, a 10-gun battery was constructed at Fort Strong on East Head on Long Island. In 1872, a large hotel was built on the current site of the Long Island Chronic Disease Hospital. Long Island became the site of illegal recreational activities. A very popular event on Sunday evenings was prize fighting. On June 29, 1873, the Boston Police raided Long Island and put a stop to these illegal events. In 1874, the gun blocks and a magazine for the Long Island Head Battery were constructed. These batteries remain today. In 1881, a new cast iron lighthouse was constructed along with a new keeper's house. This was the third lighthouse built on Long Island Head. In 1882, as was rumored earlier, the City of Boston began purchasing property on Long Island for institutional care facilities: firstly an Almshouse, later (1921) a residence for unwed mothers, a chronic disease hospital, a nursing school and an institutional farm. The large hotel built in 1872 was part of the purchase. This hotel was used for City of Boston charities. During this year, male paupers were moved to Long Island from Rainsford Island. On January 3, 1885, the Boston City Council passed an order to take possession of Long Island. The island has never returned to private hands since that date. Boston acquired Long Island from the heirs of Thomas Dunbar for $140,000. Buildings were immediately erected for a \\"Home for the Indigent.\\" These buildings housed 650 people in 1885. Sweetser described Long Island as conspicuous by its municipal buildings, and still more by its lighthouse perched on the very tip of the steepest cliff in the harbor, eighty-feet above the high-water mark and visible for fifteen miles (24 km) at sea. The battery, which crowns the cliff, presenting only a range of green mounds to the view of the passing sailor, is a formidable little work, of modern construction, with walls of great thickness, bombproofs, and other defenses, partly separated from the rest of the bluff by a deep dry moat. Development of the modern Fort Strong 1938 map of Ft. Strong, identifying its gun batteries and other buildings Three- inch Gun Platform #1 of Battery Smyth, Fort Strong (2010) Ten-inch gun emplacements at Fort Strong (2009) In 1893 a huge construction project was begun, to build the massive concrete gun emplacements for the five 10-inch guns of Fort Strong, one of the new Coast Artillery fortsA similar fort, Fort Andrews, was also constructed on the northern tip of nearby Peddocks Island. planned to defend Boston Harbor. The works for these larger batteries still exist today on the northern head of the island (see map at right). These northern emplacementsAbout 200 ft. SE of the lighthouse is the hollow shell of a 20-foot tall square concrete tower containing a central pillar, flanked by two 20-foot tall concrete pillars standing alone. These are the remains of 1920s era base end stations that were part of the fire control system for the fort's guns. Depression position finders were once bolted to the tops of the pillars. The wooden structures that once enclosed the stand-alone pillars have now been destroyed, leaving the pillars standing by themselves. were complete by 1899. Work continued on the 3-inch gun positions on the east and west sides of the parade ground (Batteries Taylor, Basinger, Smyth, and Stevens). These smaller caliber batteries were completed in 1906.Fort Strong at FortWiki.com The fort, which had previously consisted of a battery of muzzle-loading cannon atop the northeastern head of the island,These cannon were sited roughly 150 feet NE of Battery Ward, in an area now overgrown with thick brush. was now equipped with the latest in coast artillery, as part of nationwide improvements in coastal defense capabilities recommended by the Endicott Board. Although the gun batteries were completed in 1906, construction at the fort would continue through the 1920s, eventually creating a total of seven new batteries of 3-inch, 4.7-inch, and 10-inch guns along three sides of the island, extensive facilities for deploying and recovering the tethered mines which filled the nearby channels, and barracks space for over 1,000 members of the Coast Artillery who served at the fort.This number of personnel was probably a peak. In the late 1920s and the 1930s, the fort went on \\"caretaker\\" status (i.e., was \\"mothballed\\"), with only a skeleton garrison. Long Island Head was centrally situated in Boston Harbor, and the six 10-inch guns of Batteries Hitchcock and Ward (later reduced to five) had an effective range of roughly seven miles, letting them reach Revere on the north, Hingham on the south, and well out to sea in front of the harbor channels. Prior to World War II, the mining casemate at the fort (see map) controlled all the submarine mines that protected the southern approaches to Boston Harbor.Later in WW2, the southern mine command was moved to Ft. Warren on Governor's Island. The rapid fire 3-inch gun batteries constructed on all three shores of the fort overlooked these minefields to destroy attacking ships that might become entangled in them. By World War II, only the four 3-inch guns of Batteries Basinger and Smyth, plus a battery of anti-aircraft cannon, remained in service, and with the end of the war, the fort was declared surplus. In the 1950s, two buildings supporting the Nike missile system (since decommissioned) were built on the island, and a target tracking radar was constructed at the northwest end of the North Head, in one of the former gun positions of Battery Drum.Only the concrete footings for this radar tower remain in 2010.

New men's dormitory facilities were built and dedicated as the Tobin building, the cornerstone having been laid on November 9, 1940. It was named after Maurice J. Tobin, then Mayor of Boston.as written on a dedicatory plaque in the Tobin Building In 1941, Boston's almshouse was located there, as well as the Chronic Disease Hospital. 1,400 patients and inmates were on the island, cared for by several hundred doctors, nurses, and employees. At that time, Dr. James V. Sacchetti was the medical director in charge. Until the 1950s, when a bridge was built from the adjacent Moon Island, the only transportation access to the island was by boat or a regularly scheduled ferry from Boston. The dedication plaque at the outbound entry to this bridge at Squantum, says it was built in 1950-51 by the Institutions Department of the City of Boston, and calls it the \\"Long Island Viaduct\\". Moon Island is connected to the mainland Squantum peninsula of North Quincy by a causeway.

Historical buildings and cemeteries dating from the Civil War to the Cold War can be found on the island, along with a large checkered red and white pattern water tower used as a navigational aid by the FAA for navigation into Logan International Airport. There is also a working organic farm which is large and harvests approximately 25,000 pounds of produce which is used by the kitchens of the homeless shelters, and sold at farmers markets, and used by restaurants in Boston. It is staffed by residents of Long Island. The organic farm was the idea of Mayor Thomas Menino of Boston in 1996 and was modeled on the kibbutz concept.Crimaldi, Laura, \\"Fresh Start: Organic farm jobs ‘a blessing’ for Hub homeless\\", The Boston Herald, August 12, 2007.\\"Homeless serve themselves at Boston Harbor farm: People living at Boston homeless shelters grow their own produce at the Serving Ourselves Farm on harbor island\\", The Patriot Ledger, GateHouse News Service, 14 August 2009. In 2007, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino helped found and get private funding for a teenagers' day camp on Long Island called Camp Harbor View. Now a partnership between Boston, Boys & Girls Clubs of Boston, and the camp's non-profit foundation, Camp Harbor View was dedicated in March 2007 and has baseball fields, swimming, classrooms, and many other activities. The number of campers each summer is about 900. It is located where the former marching grounds were, south of Fort Strong and the lighthouse.Camp Harbor View History Another summer camp, Harbor Discoveries, was operated by the city; the New England Aquarium formerly used facilities on Long Island for part of its programming. Evacuation and afterwards On October 8, 2014, Mayor Martin J. Walsh – under the advisement of various City departments, agencies and leaders, and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) – made the decision to close the Long Island Bridge (which had suffered for decades from neglect and lack of maintenance) and evacuate the programs located on Long Island. In 2016, the organic farm, for many years worked on and tilled by homeless clients from the Long Island Shelter, and which provided fresh produce for the meals at the city's shelters and programs, was re-opened for private use by a fast food restaurant chain, b.good, who will return part of the crop to philanthropic causes.Abel, David, \\"Farm that once benefited the homeless now run by fast-food chain\\", The Boston Globe, print edition, July 25, 2016b.good restaurant website Cf. section on Long Island Farm.

The game has a science fiction setting inspired by Blade Runner. The story takes place in the year 2097, on a colonised Callisto. The game charts the protagonist Slater's attempts to discover the truth behind his sister's mysterious death while working for the titular G-Police. The game begins with the G-Police combating organised criminals before fighting the private armies of powerful corporations in an unfolding conspiracy-themed plot. The gameplay involves piloting VTOL aircraft resembling helicopters, engaging in combat with enemies and protecting allies. The game made use of cutting edge technology such as force-feedback joysticks and controllers, 3D sound and Direct3D Hardware Acceleration and was largely well received. Critics noted that the game's graphics were some of the most technically impressive of the time. Overall, however, critics had mixed response for the graphics, as the demanding graphics resulted in poor draw distance; in particular, the PlayStation version struggled in this aspect. In general, the gameplay was favourably reviewed, with critics praising the solid, enjoyable missions, though there were complaints regarding a poor control system and unfairly high levels of difficultly. The game spawned a sequel, G-Police: Weapons of Justice, released in 1999 for the PlayStation. This sequel received similar reviews to those of the original game. In 2007, G-Police was made available for download on the PlayStation Network in Europe. Gameplay The game is based around piloting aircraft and shooting enemies. G-Police is a shooter game in which the player pilots a VTOL aircraft, described by critics as \\"jet helicopters\\" or \\"a helicopter without the rotors\\". The player can choose to view the action from a variety of first- or third-person perspectives, including views from within the cockpit, a variety of \\"chase\\" perspectives, including directly from above the craft (for use when bombing). Combat in G-Police involves both dogfighting with other aircraft and dropping bombs. The player is often required to \\"scan\\" suspect vehicles to determine if they are criminal or hostile. The game's aircraft comes with numerous weapons which are upgraded as the player progresses to more difficult levels. An improved version of the basic \\"Havoc Gunship\\" aircraft (the \\"Venom Gunship\\") is also available later in the game. Missions include seeking out and destroying enemies, escorting friendly ground units, preventing smuggling and bomb disposal. The player receives updates and new instructions as the mission proceeds. The main game mode features 35 missions and an additional training mode. Most of the game's missions take place in urban \\"domes\\" filled with large buildings; some, however, take place in the \\"outer domes\\", with other themes such as agrarian settings. Synopsis Setting The game is set in 2097, according to the introductory sequence. This sequence also provides the history of the game's setting: in 2057, the depletion of Earth's resources coincided with widening space exploration. After a catastrophic war over ever-declining resources, ending 10 years prior to the events of G-Police, Earth's governments were stripped of military power. As a result, powerful corporations had exerted control over Earth and the burgeoning space colonies. The Government Police (G-Police) was formed by Earth's remaining coalition government to maintain order in these colonies. In the latter part of the introductory sequence, Slater, the game's protagonist, introduces himself as a war veteran who had joined the G-Police to conduct his own investigation of his sister Elaine's apparent suicide, suspecting that she was murdered. He also provides his view of the G-Police, stating they lack authority and \\"turn a blind eye\\" to \\"shady corporate deals\\" while attempting to maintain order. He describes the Havoc gun-ships as outdated and the pilots as a mixture of desperate war veterans and naïve idealists. Plot The action takes place in a futuristic urban setting, occasionally illustrated by cut-scenes. The early levels of the game depict Slater combating enemy gangs. The G-Police suspect \\"Krakov\\" corporation is supplying the gangs with weaponry. Krakov's president however is subsequently the subject of an assassination attempt by the gangs. During this attempt, Hiroshi Tachikawaa pilot whom Slater describes as flying his gun-ship \\"like he was born in it\\"dies when his gun-ship crashes after mysteriously malfunctioning. In the interests of morale, his death is covered up; Slater notes this incident is reminiscent of Elaine's death. After numerous terrorist attacks on their personnel and property, Krakov blames a rival corporation, \\"Nanosoft\\", and begins openly attacking them with its private army. Lacking evidence for involvement with the criminal gangs, the G-Police protect Nanosoft, ultimately destroying Krakov's military power. The G-Police, however, investigate exactly why Krakov and Nanosoft were fighting. The latter half of the game depicts a conflict between the G-Police and Nanosoft's private forces, which attack G-Police after Krakov's collapse, both out of panic as to the investigation and to tie up loose ends. In the unfolding plot, the player learns that Tachikawa and Elaine were killed (by the sabotage of their gun-ships) to procure microchips implanted in their brains. These chips can record a pilot's knowledge and combat skills; Nanosoft desired them to power the artificial intelligence in their weapons. The G-Police commander Horton is assassinated by Slater's traitorous wingman Ricardo, also to this end. The game ends with the destruction of a large spacecraft by Slater; the closing sequence reveals that Nanosoft had planned to use this to exert military dominance over other corporations. Development According to Ian Hetherington, the co-founder of Psygnosis, G-Police was developed by one of company's \\"microstudios\\" in Stroud. This studio consisted of around 70 people and was also responsible for developing Overboard! at the same time. G-Police was backed by a reported $2.5 million advertising campaign, part of a wider $6 million campaign which also included Formula 1 Championship Edition and Colony Wars. According to Psygnosis product marketing manager Mark Day, G-Police and Colony Wars were \\"neck and neck\\" as far as getting the biggest financial push from the company. A television advertisement was created to publicise the game, based around an animated sequence by Peter Chung, creator of Æon Flux. The original sequence was 21 seconds long, but was shortened to allow gameplay footage to appear in the advertisement. The animation was \\"done entirely using traditional hand- drawn methods\\", according to its creator. Regarding its development, Chung also stated: Chung claimed that the decision to \\"concentrate on the people inside the machines\\" was informed by his belief that the game's plot, setting and characters set G-Police apart from other shooters of the day. Reception G-Police received mixed to positive reviews. Upon its original release for the PlayStation, critics were impressed by the full motion video custscenes and elaborate cityscapes, but were derisive of the low draw distance. GamePro described it as \\"one of the worst cases of draw-in since 32-bit gaming began\\", reckoning that \\"About a third of the screen remains black while buildings and enemies wink into existence.\\" However, while GamePro judged this a crippling flaw, most critics assessed that the game is exemplary in spite of it. IGN said the graphics are the \\"low point of the game\\", which was redeemed by solid gameplay and attention to detail. IGN, Edge, and Shawn Smith and Crispin Boyer of Electronic Gaming Monthly all argued that the low draw distance was an easily forgivable shortcoming given the limitations of the PlayStation.\\"G-Police Review\\", Edge, Nov 1997 (Issue 51), p. 92 Edge praised the large city environments, flight simulation (noting the support for analog joypads), \\"marvellous\\" cut scenes and \\"great variety and imagination\\" of the playable missions. The controls were a point of disagreement. GameSpot, GamePro, and Dan Hsu and Crispin Boyer of EGM all said that the game controls poorly whether using analog or digital controllers. Hsu elaborated, \\"Analog is too sensitive; digital is too clunky. Poor control+speedy gameplay+lots of buildings=a disaster (and one slightly frustrated reviewer). But it's no big deal; I still recommend it highly.\\" GameSpots Joe Fielder was less forgiving, saying the control issues \\"prevent [G-Police] from having speedy arcade-style play or, in effect, acting as a compelling action title.\\" However, Hsu's co- reviewer Kelly Rickards and IGN both contended that the initially difficult controls become natural with practice. And while Fielder derided the missions as being repetitive, most critics praised their broad variety of objectives and exciting pace. Both Edge and its American sister magazine Next Generation stated that the PlayStation version's problems with draw distance and frame rate were solved in the PC version, albeit only when using high-end hardware.\\"G-Police Review (PC)\\", Edge, Feb 1998 (Issue 55), p. 94 Next Generation praised the game's support of recent technical innovations, particularly force–feedback joysticks, 3D sound, and Direct3D Hardware Acceleration. The magazine also praised the graphics (again noting the scifi influence), responsive controls and enjoyable gameplay. However, the reviewer complained that the game became overly difficult after the first few missions and that the verbal instructions were easily missed.\\"Breaking the Law: G-Police\\", Next Generation, Feb 1998, p. 118 Edge called it \\"a meeting of envelope-pushing code and solid gameplay\\". Mark East argued in GameSpot that while the PC version of G-Police is \\"quite possibly the best looking game to hit the scene since the advent of 3D-accelerator cards\\", the unintuitive controls, \\"downright ludicrous\\" level of difficulty, and the fact that those who cannot afford a high-end PC setup cannot even enjoy the game's visual merits make it not worth buying. G-Police was a runner-up for Computer Gaming Worlds 1997 \\"Action Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to Quake II. The editors called G-Police \\"the most beautiful\\" action nominee that year, but wrote that it lost its chance due to the lack of multiplayer gameplay. Sequel G-Police: Weapons of Justice is the sequel to G-Police, released in 1999 for the PlayStation. The game depicts the aftermath of the conflict between the G-Police and Nanosoft, which involves initial battles with gangs attempting to take advantage of the colony's instability. Later, another war arises between the G-Police and a power hungry leader of Earth's forces, originally sent to assist the G-Police against the gangs. The game features additional vehicles: a VTOL spacecraft, an armoured personnel carrier and the \\"Raptor\\"—a mech with the ability to leap airborne.Stahl, Ben, G-Police: Weapons of Justice Review, GameSpot, 1 October 1999, Accessed 5 April 2009 The game received similar reviews to the original game: IGN praised its well- crafted gameplay, story and sound,Sanchez, Rick, G-Police: Weapons of Justice , IGN, 29 September 1999, Accessed 5 April 2009 while GameSpot considered the controls awkward and the missions and setting repetitive. The graphics again received a mixed reception: IGN praised the attention to detail but criticised the poor draw distance, as did GameSpot. In 2001, a rumoured sequel for the PlayStation 2 was reported. The rumours later proved false. While Sony contemplated the notion of a G-Police game for the PlayStation 2, they decided that, because G-Police was not as successful as other games, Psygnosis (which had since been renamed Studio Liverpool) would instead concentrate on the Formula 1 and Wipeout franchises. Furthermore, the development team responsible for G-Police and Weapons of Justice had moved on to other ventures.G-Police PS2 rumour fails to stick, Computer and Video Games, 15 August 2001, Accessed 5 April 2009 In 2007, G-Police was made available for download on PlayStation 3.

Gilligan, affectionately called \\"little buddy\\" by the \\"Skipper\\", is the bumbling, dimwitted, accident-prone first mate of the . None of the show's episodes ever specified Gilligan's full name or clearly indicate whether \\"Gilligan\\" is the character's first or his last name. Gilligan wears a trademark red shirt, pale trousers, white sneakers, and white navy cap. During a storm, he throws an anchor overboard without a rope attached, which leaves the Minnow shipwrecked on an \\"uncharted desert isle\\" with its seven passengers and crew, establishing the underlying premise of the franchise. The enduring popularity of the series has made him a cultural icon.  Background  Gilligan served in the United States Navy with Jonas Grumby (the Skipper) during an unspecified war and saved him from being struck and killed by a runaway depth charge. Upon retirement, Grumby, described as \\"an old salt in these waters\\", used his savings to buy the Minnow, and as the captain (or \\"Skipper\\" as he was nearly invariably addressed), Grumby hired his \\"little buddy\\", Gilligan, as his first mate. Gilligan's past and family are fleetingly mentioned during the series. Such characters include: an older brother from whom he swiped his ever-present red shirt, his Uncle Ramsey (who was the guide for \\"The Lost Battalion\\" in World War One), possibly a sister ,This is a reference to lines from the season two episode \\"The Postman Cometh\\". It is unclear there that Gilligan has a sister. In one version of the scene, he refers to \\"a friend of my sister's\\" being heartbroken, but in another version of the same scene, he says \\"a friend of mine's sister\\". his cousin Rudolph, his father (who wore glasses and a mustache and was short), his grandmother, whose advice he imparts to Ginger during the episode \\"Don't Bug The Mosquitoes\\", Aunt Sarah, who had a \\"sneaky disease\\", and an Uncle John who was apparently illiterate. He once mentioned he was born in Pennsylvania, but no city was specified.This happened in the season three episode, \\"And Then There Were None\\". He sometimes mentioned his childhood friends Skinny Mulligan, Fatso Flanagan, and Billy Maguire, possibly implying that he came from a predominantly Irish-American neighborhood and that his last name was Gilligan. Among his possessions are comic books, a boy scout book, a diary, a \\"Manny Moose\\" watch, and his high school ring.  Personality  The character of Gilligan is noted for physical comedy, often with his friend the Skipper in the role of a comic foil. Continuing gags of the show include Gilligan's seduction by Ginger, eating Mary Ann's coconut cream pies, joking about the Skipper's weight, and inadvertently undermining any attempts and efforts of the castaways to get off the island. He often interjected discussions with pointless anecdotes about his childhood or with seemingly useless advice. Though he was often chided by the Skipper for interrupting, on more than one occasion, Gilligan's seemingly random nonsense actually triggered the Professor to remember a useful fact or suggest a course of action. In some episodes, he attempts to make an important suggestion, but is interrupted by the Skipper or another castaway, who tells him to be quiet until the discussion is practically over, when he is able to tell them. Examples of this include the episode where he discovered waterproof glue that turned out to be temporary and that the ship will sink. His warning was ignored until the point when the boat's boards came undone. Another time when a butterfly collector came to the island and refused to signal until he got what he came for, the castaways are arguing amongst themselves about the collector's recalcitrance and ignoring Gilligan, until he gets in the last word by saying he stole the man's flare gun. Despite his bumbling nature, Gilligan has an innate innocence of character that causes the others to forgive his mistakes. He occasionally saves the others when an escape plan goes awry. He performs virtually all manual labor on the island, mostly without complaint; the Skipper notes that Gilligan can \\"run as fast as a rabbit [and] climb a tree like a monkey\\". Gilligan often acts as the Howells' servant; duties include golf caddy, chauffeur for the castaways' pedal-powered car, and waiter at the \\"Howell Private Country Club\\". Gilligan also makes several discoveries, but they often have disastrous results, and he is usually faced with big decisions. Often, Thurston Howell III attempts to bribe him with money, or Ginger with seduction or fake crying. Examples include whom to give the last orange on the island, or whom to give hot water from a hole in the ground (which the Professor later discovered to be an active volcano). On one occasion, Gilligan found seeds which gave people the ability to read minds, but when the seeds proved to have disastrous results, he gathered up the bush and all the seeds on the island and burned them. Despite frequently ruining plans to get off the island, his fellow castaways (the Skipper included) ultimately harbor affection for him. When Gilligan was bitten by a potentially fatal insect and showed all the symptoms following the bite, everyone tried to find a cure, only to get bitten themselves (although the insect was later found to be harmless). Upon hearing this, Ginger and Mary Ann burst into tears, and the Skipper attempts to cheer them up by having them envision everyone getting off the island. This temporarily works, until Mary Ann says, \\"Except for Gilligan\\", before Ginger and she start crying again. Gilligan is occasionally the exception to the rescue ruination, though. In the episode \\"The Big Gold Strike\\", which involved both the finding of the S.S. Minnow's life raft and repairing of it, along with the discovery of gold on the island, the Professor warned the castaways to not bring gold on the raft due to weight concerns, but every castaway brought a personal item on with them to smuggle gold, with an alternate excuse as to why (including the Professor and the Skipper), causing the raft to sink in the lagoon and for them to lose both the raft and gold. However, after they all confess to bringing a bag of gold on the raft, they all turn and look at Gilligan, who realizes he was the only one who actually obeyed the Professor's warning, causing him to laugh and say, \\"That's a switch. Usually I'm the one left holding the bag.\\" Ultimately, Gilligan's ineptitude ended up rescuing the castaways. In the 1978 film Rescue from Gilligan's Island the group flees certain death when a tsunami hits the island by merging their huts into a makeshift boat. They are now off the island, but still adrift on the high seas. Gilligan lights a fire, which is immediately extinguished and he is scolded by the other castaways for such a harebrained activity. A US Coast Guard helicopter notices the smoke plume and investigates, positively identifying the lost castaways from the SS Minnow and remarks that the using a fire to signal was smart thinking, else they would have remained lost at sea and unnoticed.  Intelligence  Despite an awkward exterior, Gilligan has shown some intelligence. He tenaciously guards his position, particularly when someone tries to use him. Gilligan has also proven his willingness to \\"step up to the plate\\" should leadership call – although, if Gilligan does not break the plate, it usually fractures. In the end, a double measure of fortune corrects his missteps. He also had a habit of often saying something that gave someone else a good idea leading to them saying, \\"Gilligan you've done it again,\\" to which he says, \\"I don't know what I'm doing but I keep doing it.\\" Gilligan, like Barney Fife, Gomer Pyle, and other comic figures of the era, is considered an unlikely or \\"backdoor\\" hero, whose good intentions always win out over sheer stupidity.  Cultural impact  Today, Gilligan is widely recognized as an American popular culture icon; he ranked at 122nd place in the July 2003 list of 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons compiled by VH-1 and People.  Name  Gilligan's full name has been a subject of debate among fans of the series for decades. On the 2004 DVD release of season one, Gilligan's Island — The Complete First Season, a documentary called Before the Three Hour Tour shows that Sherwood Schwartz's original treatment for the series indicated that Gilligan's full name in the failed pilot was to be \\"Willy Gilligan\\", but that rendition, with other unfamiliar castaways, was canned and did not air. The documentary also reveals that Schwartz found the name \\"Gilligan\\" by flipping through a Los Angeles telephone directory. Another story was that the term Gilligan was once mariner's slang for an unlucky or jinxed member of a ship's crew.See also Robert M. Jarvis, \\"Legal Tales from Gilligan's Island\\", Santa Clara Law Review 39(1): 185–205 (1998), especially footnote 7 (the name \\"was amusing enough to indicate a comedy series and acceptable enough to avoid burlesque\\"). Bob Denver, on various television/radio interviews (The Pat Sajak Show, KDKA radio), said that \\"Gil Egan\\" was his choice. The actor reasoned that because everyone yelled at the first mate, it ran together as \\"Gilligan\\". On the May 18, 1988, episode of the Late Show on Fox, Denver said that Sherwood Schwartz told him Gilligan's first name was Willy.

On September 24, 2007, Shuster interviewed Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn while filling in on Tucker Carlson's show. When Shuster asked about her response to the MoveOn.org ad campaign concerning General David Petraeus's Iraq War testimony, he followed up by asking her the name of the last soldier from her congressional district who had been killed in Iraq. She was not able to name the soldier. Shuster then said the soldier was 18-year-old Jeremy Bohannon, and asked Blackburn why she was unable to recall the name. Blackburn's office claimed that Bohannon was not actually from Blackburn's congressional district, but was from the congressional district of Rep. John Tanner. However, while Bohannon did grow up in Tanner's district, his legal residence for the year prior to his enlistment was in Blackburn's district. During his MSNBC tenure, he anchored MSNBC Live and filled in for Keith Olbermann, Chris Matthews, Ed Schultz, and Rachel Maddow on their respective shows.

In December, the program started internet video production via YouTube, produced by The David Pakman Show. Al Jazeera America On July 21, 2013, The Huffington Post reported that Shuster had accepted a hosting position at Al Jazeera America anchoring live news shows and hosting a politics analysis show, called Power Politics. In April 2016, Al Jazeera ceased broadcasting on cable TV across the United States. Shuster has since appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe. i24 News On February 9, 2017, it was announced that Shuster had been named anchor and managing editor of the American arm of i24 News, just four days before the network began its broadcasting.

The show was hosted by Cleveland native Al Lewis (1924–2009) (not to be confused with the actor who played Grandpa on The Munsters), and later was co-hosted by his wife, Wanda. The show enjoyed a remarkable 35-year run (1950–1985) on WCPO-TV, making it one of the longest-running local children's shows in American TV history.The longest-running local children's show in American TV history was The Magic Window, which aired from 1951-1994 in Des Moines, Iowa. (Sesame Street holds the national record being on the air continuously since 1969.) Uncle Al holds the unofficial record for the longest-running regularly-scheduled series with the same host for the show's entire run. History The show's origins were completely by happenstance. In the summer of 1949, then-General Manager Mort Watters asked Lewis (hired on two months earlier as WCPO's first art director) to host an hour-long filler show called Al's Corner Drugstore, in which Lewis, dressed in a soda jerk's uniform, would take phone-in requests for songs which he would play on his accordion, which would later become one of his many trademarks along with his straw boater hat. At that time, the show was not aired in a closed set, so people could walk in from off the street to watch the show in person. Neighborhood children began doing just that, and Lewis, having a natural affinity for children, invited them onto the stage during the show. The same kids would return on subsequent occasions bringing friends, and they all took to calling Lewis \\"Uncle Al\\". When mothers began calling into the station requesting tickets to be on The Uncle Al Show, a Cincinnati institution was born. The Uncle Al Show made its official début on June 12, 1950. Having originally started as a 15-minute outing, it quickly expanded into an hour long show airing three episodes daily: ::First episode: 9-10 am (ET) ::Second episode: 11 am-12 noon (ET) ::Third episode: 1-2 pm (ET) By the mid-late 1960s the show was scaled back to one 90-minute episode per day from 9 to 10:30 am, running opposite WLWT's Paul Dixon Show. By 1955 Uncle Al had become so popular that executives from CBS came to Cincinnati to consult with Al about hosting a similar show on their network; this was before WCPO switched affiliation from ABC to CBS in 1961. Station executives understandably refused to release Lewis from his contract, so CBS brass settled on Howdy Doody alum Bob Keeshan to host their new kids' show, which became Captain Kangaroo. When WCPO switched networks, both shows would run back-to-back on weekday mornings. Lewis' wife Wanda joined the show in 1956. Initially, Wanda was called \\"Captain Windy\\", costumed in a superhero-like outfit during the early days of the show, and was seen \\"flying\\" Superman-style before she made her entrance on stage. Her shy, quiet manner inspired colleague Paul Dixon to call her \\"The Windy One\\" when they co-starred on their own show. Uncle Al's show was picked up by ABC from October 18, 1958 until September 19, 1959. Uncle Al & the kids The kids who visited Uncle Al were more than just audience members; most of them were selected to be active participants for different skits on the show. While Wanda would handle the more educational aspects of the show, featuring kids assisting in one way or another, Uncle Al got kids involved as helpers for puppets doing different odd jobs, or he would enlist a child from the crowd on-the-spot to be a barker for games at Uncle Al's circus (\\"Step right up! Win a prize!\\"). At the age of eight, George Clooney appeared in a 1970 episode of Uncle Al playing a ship's captain in one of the show's skits.Friedman, Jim: \\"Images Of America: Cincinnati Television\\", photo- page 71. Arcadia Publishing, 2007, By the 1960s, kids who appeared on the show each were given a name-tag sticker in the shape of a bow tie modeled after Uncle Al's sartorial trademark. While the kids were told the name tag was a ticket to get in and a souvenir to take home, the primary reason for them was so that Lewis could refer to each child by name.Friedman, Jim: \\"Images Of America: Cincinnati Television\\", page 70. Arcadia Publishing, 2007, Initially the tags were plain white, but later included the name of the show to one side, and WCPO's \\"9\\" logo to the other, with room in the middle for the child's name. Other activities included dance contests, celebrating birthdays of kids in the audience that day (which was usually done during their trip to the circus near the end of the show) and singing, accompanied by Al himself, who often played either a banjo, a guitar or his trademark accordion singing simple ditties like this one: :\\"When we sing together songs are such delight.. Har-mo-nee makes the melody right..\\" Each day the show would end with Uncle Al, Wanda and the kids all singing a prayer on the air before the kids made their way off the stage: :(they sang the first three lines of the prayer) ::\\"Help me, God, to love you more, ::Than I ever did before, ::In my work and in my play, :(the last five lines they spoke) ::Please be with me through the day, ::Thank you for the friends we meet, ::Thank you for the food we eat, ::Thank you for the birds that sing, ::Thank you, God, for everything!\\" The cast and the kids would then say their goodbyes and the kids would walk off the set as the closing credits ran. The show's closing theme was the last few verses of the Disney standard It's a Small World written by Robert & Richard Sherman. Unusual moments In a 1990 interview, Lewis related an incident during a live show where he saw a little girl offstage sitting on his accordion, Lewis often assigned one of the kids' mothers to watch his accordion for him when he wasn't playing it. On this occasion it was the assigned mother's daughter who was sitting on the accordion. After a commercial break, Lewis went to retrieve the accordion to play it on camera and the keys promptly got stuck; the girl had urinated into his accordion. Thankfully, the instrument was insured and replaced, much to the chagrin of the insurer.https://web.archive.org/web/20080110042159/http://www.cetconnect.org/broadcastpioneers/personalities.asp/?idv=105 Sponsors One of the show's many trademarks was when they would go to an external commercial, Uncle Al would get everyone in front of the camera to say \\"magic words\\": :\\"Ala-kazam one, Ala-kazam two, Ala-kazam three, and POOF!!\\" But on equally frequent occasions, they would do in-house commercials for various local businesses. These included, but were not limited to: :*Kahn's Wieners: Billed at the time as \\"The Wiener the World Awaited\\", these commercials sometimes featured a talking puppet in the shape of a \\"Man in the Moon\\" frankfurter, possibly created by puppeteer Larry Smith. :*Mama's Cookies: Uncle Al and the kids together would sing a variation of \\"Shortnin' Bread\\" as the jingle in this commercial. :*Barq's Soft Drinks: This was when Barq's had other flavors besides just root beer; they also had orange, grape, lemon-lime and cream soda flavors as well. Wanda would sing the jingle while she and an assistant served drinks to the kids. :*Al Naish Movers: Associated at one time with Mayflower movers, Naish was known for giving toy trucks to their customers' kids. The family-owned company is still in business today. :*Pat & Joe's: A now-defunct husband-and-wife-owned chain of five volume furniture stores in and around the Cincinnati area; the show used a jingle sung to the tune of \\"Mary Had A Little Lamb\\" which went: ::My good friends are Pat & Joe, Pat & Joe, Pat & Joe, ::my good friends are Pat & Joe, they save your mommy do-ough.. :*Alber's Grocery Store: These commercials featured children holding signs with the letters A, L, B, E, R, ', and S. They were to smile and the child with the apostrophe would make the it bob up and down while the Alber's jingle played. Regulars Uncle Al's farm was also frequented by his in-house friends, which at one time or another included: :*Pal the Dog, Uncle Al's pet :*Lucky the Clown Used mainly when they visited the circus near the end of each show. (originally played by Jack Williams, and by Artie Scheff on the weekend version) :*The Merry Mailman: A puppet who delivered viewer mail to Uncle Al every day. (the producers used the last few lines of the Ray Heatherton song from the New York kids show of the same name) :*The Ding-A-Lings: A group of giggling, dancing squiggly columns. :*The Weather People: These consisted of kids dressed in double-sided sun and cloud costumes (one side happy, the other side sad). If the weather forecast for a given day called for sunshine, the sun costume would be turned happy for the camera, and a \\"pity party\\" would be briefly held for the sad cloud. The opposite, of course, would ensue if that day's forecast called for rain. :*Mr. Patches (Tom McGreevey): When going to a commercial break from a skit he was in, Mr. Patches would say some magic words of his own, finishing with a \\"hum-m-m-m-m-mmmmm\\". Some of the cast members went on to become beloved Cincinnati TV Personalities in their own right. Most notable among these were: Larry Smith: Dayton native Smith began his Cincinnati TV career with The Uncle Al Show handling and performing (and even creating) most of the puppets; he remained with the show for six years. Starting in the late 1960s he hosted his own afternoon kids cartoon show on WXIX. Smith passed away in February 2018. Bob Shreve: A consummate performer, Shreve played various characters including Roger the Robot and, at one point, Lucky The Clown. He was a commercial pitchman for various Cincinnati businesses including Schoenling Beer and Pool City, and hosted late night movie shows that, at one time or another, ran on all three major Cincinnati TV stations and even one station in nearby Dayton over a 40-year period. Shreve died in February 1990. Mike Tangi: Tangi worked both behind and in front of the camera on Uncle Al and at WCPO in general from 1953 to 1963. He later worked with Glenn Ryle at WKRC-TV before going into advertising in the 1970s, writing and performing memorable commercials for King Kwik Minit Markets. Tangi died in 1995. Later years Throughout the years The Uncle Al Show remained a perennial ratings champion in Cincinnati, especially when the show ran three times a day. Personalities from competing stations knew they were in trouble when their shows were rescheduled opposite Uncle Al. The show ran an estimated 15,000 episodes, with an estimated 440,000 children having appeared on the show throughout its run. By 1975, the show had adopted a more educational base, with guest appearances by members of the Cincinnati Police and Fire departments, representatives from the Cincinnati Zoo, educators and many others. But despite the educational enrichments, The Uncle Al Show continued to hold fast to the values the children came to love from day one. By the early 1980s, demographics were changing, and The Uncle Al Show was not immune. The show was first cut down to a half-hour, and then moved from its weekday slot to an early-morning weekend show. The show was renamed Uncle Al Town with the final episode taped on May 29, 1985. Despite the show coming to an end, both Al and Wanda remained at WCPO to the end of the 1980s. Al and Wanda both retired to their home, a large farm near Hillsboro, Ohio. But in retirement, the Lewises remained active in their community, and on occasion made personal appearances at festivals and other functions in Cincinnati. Surrounded by his family, Al Lewis died at his Hillsboro home on February 28, 2009 at the age of 84. He was survived by his wife Wanda, his four daughters and his 13 grandchildren. Wanda passed away August 17, 2020 at the age of 94.

McCollum, who previous served in FL-5 since 1981, was shifted to the 8th District after the redistricting. 1994 election Incumbent Republican Bill McCollum ran unopposed in the mid-terms. His re-election was part of the 1994 Republican Revolution. 1996 election Incumbent Republican Bill McCollum (67.47%) won easily over progressive Democrat and actor Al Krulick (32.52%). 1998 election Incumbent McCollum faced Krulick for the second time. McCollum won 66%-34%, a nearly identical margin from 1996. He won his seat for the tenth (and final) time. Despite some minor losses in the midterm for the GOP, McCollum was among the 15 Florida Republican incumbents who all won re-election. 2000 election Twenty year veteran Republican incumbent Bill McCollum retired from the seat, to run (unsuccessfully) for the open Senate seat in Florida. The open seat in District 8 would be fought between former Orange County Commission Chairwoman Linda Chapin (Democrat) and attorney Ric Keller (Republican). Keller endured a rough primary, which went to a runoff between himself and state representative Bill Sublette. Sublette had received the most votes in the September 5th primary (43.41%), but not enough to avoid a runoff. On October 3rd, Keller flipped the results, and won the two-man primary 51.94%-48.06%. Chapin quickly raised over $1.4 million in campaign contributions, more than Sublette and Keller combined. In the general election, Chapin touted her public experience over Keller, who was political newcomer and a virtual unknown. Keller attacked Chapin as anti-gun rights, and for a record of fiscal irresponsibility. He famously cited her spending of $18,500 in county funds for a bronze sculpture of a frog. Keller narrowly won the traditionally republican-leaning district by a margin of 51% to 49%. 2002 After the 2001 Congressional re-apportionment, Florida's 8th District was redistricted from a near equal representation (Democrat- Republican) to one that included seven percent more Republicans than Democrats. Keller readily won the 2002 Congressional election against Democrat Eddie Diaz, winning with 65% of the vote. 2004 In 2004 Keller won his third term with 60% of the vote against Democratic challenger Stephen Murray. 2006 election In the 2006 election, Ric Keller was elected to his fourth two-year term, defeating Democrat Charlie Stuart, Independent Wes Hoaglund, and three write-in candidates. Keller managed to hold on to his seat in the midst of a Democratic wave that was sweeping the country that November. Keller had been slipping in popularity, winning by lower margins in each election. He also had been mildly lampooned by local media with the nickname \\"Cheeseburger Ric,\\" for introducing the so-called \\"Cheeseburger Bill\\" to the House floor in 2003 and again in 2005. 2008 election Despite a prior pledge to serve only four terms, Congressman Ric Keller was running for his fifth term in the House of Representatives. Todd Long, a conservative Orlando attorney and radio talk show host, announced he would challenge Keller in the Republican primary, promising to make an issue of the broken term-limits pledge.Rachel Kapochunas, \\"Keller’s Early ‘08 Opponent Focusing on Broken Term Limit Pledge\\", New York Times, December 5, 2006 The Keller-Long primary fight intensified over the summer, with Keller's term limit retraction, as well as his vote against The Surge making him increasingly vulnerable to defeat. However, just days before the August 26 primary, Keller sent out a mailer exposing Long's arrest record, a DUI, and another trespass warning. Keller won the primary with a 53%-47% margin, but his reputation took a hit, as many saw the mailer as a political \\"dirty trick.\\" Keller's Democratic opponent was attorney and progressive activist Alan Grayson, who emerged as the surprise victor of a large Democratic primary field which included moderate Democrat and long-time Central Florida political operative Charlie Stuart, attorney Mike Smith, engineer Alexander Fry, and recent law school graduate Quoc Van. Grayson defeated Keller in the November general election receiving 52% of the vote, the same share as Barack Obama on the top of the ballot. Democratic activists in the district had mounted an aggressive campaign to register traditionally Democratic union workers and an increasing Hispanic (primarily Puerto Rican) demographic in the district. The general election was heated, with \\"mudslinging\\" and attack ads by both sides on television and in mailers. The race gained considerable national attention. 2010 election Freshman Democrat incumbent Alan Grayson ran unopposed for the nomination, while the Republican side was won by former State Senate Majority Leader and Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives Daniel Webster. After less than two years in congress, Grayson had become known as a firebrand liberal and outspoken critic on the House floor, often to the point of controversy even from members of his own party. GOP leaders early on targeted Grayson and this district, which had traditionally leaned republican, for challenge in the mid-term election. Daniel Webster had initially rejected the suggestions by the Florida GOP to run for the seat, but in April 2010, he changed his mind and entered the race. Webster's name recognition and endorsements from Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee helped him emerge as the front-runner. Webster won the GOP primary on August 24, 2010, defeating six other candidates, with 40% of the vote. In the general election, Webster ran a traditional, conservative family values-based campaign. However, Grayson had a deep war chest fueled by a nationwide campaign fundraising network. Grayson ran attack ads, calling Webster a \\"draft-dodger\\"Mark Schlueb Alan Grayson TV ad calls Dan Webster a draft dodger Orlando Sentinel. Retrieved 9/26/10 (Webster had received student deferments and a draft classification as medically unfit for service), and another calling Webster \\"Taliban Dan\\" for his perceived extreme right religious views on social issues.Mark Schlueb (9/26/10) Grayson TV ad compares Webster to Taliban Orlando Sentinel. Retrieved 9/26/10. Grayson's attack ads were criticized, and observers suggest they ultimately backfired. With just days left before voters went to the polls, Grayson was considered increasingly vulnerable to defeat. On election day, Webster defeated Grayson soundly by an 18-point margin, part of a sweeping 63-seat gain by House Republicans in the midterm election. 2012 election Previous incumbent Daniel Webster was redistricted to run instead for the 10th district. The \\"new\\" District 8 would comprise areas that formerly made up the 15th district. Bill Posey, effectively running as the incumbent, won re-election with nearly 60% of the vote against Democratic nominee Shannon Roberts and non-partisan candidate Richard Gillmor. 2014 election 2016 election 2018 election Historical district boundaries From 1993 through 2012, the district was based inland within central Florida. It took in parts of Orange County (including Walt Disney World and most of Orlando), Lake County, Marion County and Osceola County. In 2012, effective January 2013, the 8th district was reassigned to the Atlantic coast, with Brevard County and Indian River County, plus the east end of Orange County and Orlando. It is geographically the successor to the old 15th district. 2003 - 2013 References Congressional Biographical Directory of the United States 1774–present 08 1953 establishments in Florida ","title":"Florida's 8th congressional district"},{"id":"6461344","text":"Gate on Stony Hill Starveall and Stony Down is a 22.5 hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in the parishes of Codford and Wylye, Wiltshire, notified in 1971.

It is a structural condition of overurbanization and its growth leads to saturated urban labour market, truncated opportunity structures in rural areas, overburdened public services, distorted sectoral development in world economies, the isolation of large segments of the urban and rural population from the fruits of economic development, and economic growth due to the high costs of urban development.Gugler J.

'Why poor people stay poor: urban bias in world development.'(Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1977) Groups often said to have an 'urban bias' include governments, political parties, labor unions, students, laws, civil servants and manufacturers. These interests are portrayed as often not reflecting the comparative economic advantage of the country, usually a less- industrialized country whose comparative advantage is considered to be export agriculture. Among the leading scholars to claim urban bias are Michael Lipton and Robert H. Bates.Markets and States in Tropical Africa (Los Angeles: California UP, 1981) The notion of urban bias is particularly popular among those who advocate neoliberal economic policies. Many World Bank publications  recent WTO discussions on agriculture use the notion of urban bias to support policies oriented toward export agriculture.

The meat of mature or almost mature cattle is mostly known as beef. In beef production there are three main stages: cow-calf operations, backgrounding, and feedlot operations. The production cycle of the animals start at cow-calf operations; this operation is designed specifically to breed cows for their offspring. From here the calves are backgrounded for a feedlot. Animals grown specifically for the feedlot are known as feeder cattle, the goal of these animals is fattening. Animals not grown for a feedlot are typically female and are commonly known as replacement heifers. While the principal use of beef cattle is meat production, other uses include leather, and beef by-products used in candy, shampoo, cosmetics, insulin and inhalers. Calving and breeding Besides breeding to meet the demand for beef production, owners also use selective breeding to attain specific traits in their beef cattle. An example of a desired trait could be leaner meat or resistance to illness. Breeds known as dual-purpose are also used for beef production. These breeds have been selected for two purposes at once, such as both beef and dairy production, or both beef and draught. Dual-purpose breeds include many of the Zebu breeds of India such as Tharparkar and Ongole Cattle. There are multiple continental breeds that were bred for this purpose as well. The original Simmental/Fleckvieh from Switzerland is a prime example. Not only are they a dual-purpose breed for beef and dairy, but in the past they were also used for draught. However, throughout the generations, the breed has diverged into two groups through selective breeding. Most beef cattle are mated naturally, whereby a bull is released into a cowherd approximately 55 days after the calving period, depending on the cows' body condition score (BCS). If it was a cow's first time calving, she will take longer to re-breed by at least 10 days. However, beef cattle can also be bred through artificial insemination, depending on the cow and the size of the herd. Cattle are normally bred during the summer so that calving may occur the following spring. However, cattle breeding can occur at other times of year. Depending on the operation, calving may occur all year round. Owners can select the breeding time based on a number of factors, including reproductive performance, seasonal cattle pricing and handling facilities. There are many factors that come into play when selecting for a bull. Some of the most important factors are disease prevention/spread. Buying a bull who hasn't been tested for common diseases is a risk, it would more than likely transmit to a whole herd. Purchasing genetics that will improve the original herd rather than remaining the same or decreasing. Some breed for mothering abilities, some for size, some for meat properties, etc. Breeding Soundness Examination or BSE are essential to the quality of any bull, a general physical exam and inspection of both the genital organs and their productivity. Knowing more information about the animal will help make an educated decision. Cattle maintenance Cattle handlers are expected to maintain a low stress environment for their herds, involving constant safety, health, comfort, nourishment and humane handling. According to the Canadian National Farm Animal Care Council, beef cattle must have access to shelter from extreme weather, safe handling and equipment, veterinary care and humane slaughter. If an animal is infected or suspected to have an illness, it is the responsibility of the owners to report it immediately to a practicing veterinarian for either treatment or euthanasia. Depending on a multitude of factors (season, type of production system, stocking density, etc.), illness and disease can spread quickly through the herd from animal to animal. Owners are expected to monitor their cattle's condition regularly for early detection and treatment, as some cattle illnesses can threaten both cattle and human health (known as zoonotic) as witnessed with Mad cow disease and Tuberculosis. On average, cattle will consume 1.4 to 4% of their body weight daily. There are a range of types of feed available for these animals. The standard text in the United States, Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle, has been through eight editions over at least seventy years.nap.edu: \\"Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle Eighth Revised Edition (2016)\\" The 1996 seventh edition substituted the concept of metabolizeable protein for the sixth edition's crude protein.uaex.edu: \\"Beef cattle nutrition series - Part 3: Nutrient Requirement Tables\\", University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture publication MP391National Research Council (U.S.). Subcommittee on Beef Cattle Nutrition: \\"Nutrient requirements of beef cattle, sixth revised edition 1984\\" In the 20th century, Canadian practice followed the American guidance.www.carc-crac.ca: \\"Recommended code of practice for the care and handling of farm animals: Beef Cattle\\", p.2 of the 1991 edition Already in 1970, the Food and Drug Administration was regulating pharmaceutical supplements in beef cattle feed such as hormones and prophylactic antibiotics.[https://archive.org/details/beefcattlefeedin1025weic/page/8 Weichenthal, B. A; Russell, H. G (1970): \\"Beef cattle feeding suggestions : nutrient requirements, balancing rations, protein supplements, suggested rations\\" Urbana, IL : University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, College of Agriculture, Cooperative Extension Service Some animals live on pasture their entire lives and therefore only experience fresh grass, these are typically cow-calf operations in more tropical climates. Backgrounded calves and feedlot animals tend to have different diets that contain more grain than the pasture type. Grain is more expensive than pasture but the animals grow faster with the higher protein levels. Since cattle are herbivores and need roughage in their diet, silage, hay and/or haylage are all viable feed options. Despite this 3/4th of the 32 pounds (14.52 kg) of feed cattle consume each day will be corn. Cattle weighing 1000 lbs. will drink an average of 41 L a day, and approximately 82 L in hot weather. They need a constant supply of good quality feed and potable water according to the 5 Freedoms of Animal Welfare. Most Beef cattle are finished in feedlots. The first feedlots were constructed in the early 1950s. Some of these feedlots grew so large they warranted a new designation, \\"Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation\\" (CAFO). Most American beef cattle spend the last half of their lives in a CAFO. Cattle processing A steer that weighs when alive makes a carcass weighing approximately , once the blood, head, feet, skin, offal and guts are removed. The carcass is then hung in a cold room for between one and four weeks, during which time it loses some weight as water dries from the meat. It is then deboned and cut by a butcher or packing house, the carcass would make about of beef. Depending on what cuts of meat are desired, there is a scale of marbled meat used to determine the quality. Marbling is the fat that is within the muscle, not around it. The more marbled a cut is, the higher it will grade and be worth more. Slaughtering of livestock has three distinct stages: preslaughter handling, stunning and slaughtering. The biggest concern is preslaughter handling, how the animal is treated before it is stunned and slaughtered. Stress at this time can cause adverse effects on the meat, water access and lower stocking densities have been allowed to minimize this. However, access to feed is restricted for 12–24 hours prior to slaughtering for ease of evisceration. Stunning is done when the animal is restrained in a chute so movement is limited. Once restrained the animal can be stunned in one of three methods: penetrating captive bolt, non-penetrating captive bolt and gunshot. Most abattoirs use captive bolts over guns. Stunning ensures the animal feels no pain during slaughtering and reduces the animals stress, therefore increasing the quality of meat. The final step is slaughtering, typically the animal will be hung by its back leg and its throat will be slit to allow exsanguination. The hide will be removed for further processing at this point and the animal will be broken down with evisceration and decapitation. The carcass will be placed in a cooler for 24–48 hours prior to meat cutting.  Breeds  { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align: left;\\" - ! Breed !

Led by artistic director Jeff Clarke, it takes its name from Haydn's operatic setting of Goldoni's farce Il mondo della luna. The company presents innovative, usually zany and irreverent, small-scale productions and adaptations of Gilbert and Sullivan, other comic opera and operetta, in English. Opera della Luna is a registered British charity. The company undertakes two major tours each year, visiting over a hundred mid-scale venues throughout the UK. Occasionally the company has toured overseas. Clarke directs all of the productions, which are small- scale adaptations performed without chorus, accompanied by a small orchestral ensemble.Opera della luna official website , accessed 12 November 2009 History and description In 1986, Clarke founded The English Players, a touring opera ensemble. Clarke's productions for that company included English-language adaptations of Love in a Village (which toured as far as Denver, Colorado), Boieldieu's The Caliph of Bagdad and Abu Hassan (two one- act operas presented together), Il mondo della luna and Robinson Crusoé. After four years, Clark disbanded The English Players while he planned for a new, better-funded company.Clarke, Jeff. Borrowed Light: A retrospective of 15 years on the road with Opera della Luna, Jeff Clarke and Opera della Luna, Bicester (2010). With the help of marketer and versatile theatre professional Graham Watson, Clarke established Opera della Luna as a registered charity with a board of directors and a base of regular supporters. The company's name was intended to convey its zany style of adaptation. The company's first production, in 1994, was Robinson Crusoé. Plagued by transit strikes, the show lost money.Bradley, p. 86 Clarke and friends made up part of the deficit by playing evenings of music hall concerts. The company recovered, however, and toured successfully ever since. In 2010, Clarke described the company's first 15 years in a memoir of the company organised around photographs of its various productions, Borrowed Light: A retrospective of 15 years on the road with Opera della Luna. The book describes all of the company's productions up to 2010 and includes cast lists. Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan in 1893. OdL reimagined five of their operas a century later. Gilbert and Sullivan adaptations =Parson's Pirates= The company achieved its first theatrical financial success in 1995 with Clarke's adaptation of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Pirates of Penzance called The Parson's Pirates, about the vicar of St Michael's Under Ware, who is tasked with raising church funds through an amateur production of Pirates. The original idea had been merely to produce an evening of Gilbert and Sullivan hits with five singers. Clarke wrote, in his 2010 memoir, Actress Louise Crane played Ruth and is still a member of the company. Choreographer Jenny Arnold had worked on Robinson Crusoe with the old company and has continued as choreographer ever since. The piece (and all of OdL's subsequent G&S; pieces) is played without chorus – principals are assigned to cover choral lines in the music, in sometimes startling and amusing ways. The original three-night stand was a surprise hit, and touring followed. Since then Richard Suart and Ian Belsey have performed in the production numerous times. Critic George Hall wrote that the production \\"is an evening of brilliance, both a tribute to and an affectionate send-up of [Pirates], done with verve, style, some excellent voices and a hefty quotient of camp. With Richard Suart ... we know we're in for a treat.... Ian Belsey [and the rest of the cast] are all great fun and Jeff Clarke directs the whole at a cracking pace.... This is a show both for Gilbert and Sullivan devotees and for novices.... In short, a total treat – irresistible and unmissable.\\"Hall, George. \\"The Parson's Pirates\\", The Stage, 19 September 2002 =Ruddigore and Mikado= Three other G&S; adaptations soon followed, with direction by Clarke and choreography by Arnold, all adapted for a cast of 6 to 8 and no chorus. The first was The Ghosts of Ruddigore (1997), where a couple of nerds, Amanda Goodheart and Kevin Murgatroyd, have car trouble like Brad and Janet in the Rocky Horror Show. They find themselves in the spooky Brigadoon-like village of Rederring, where they discover their ancestors and become embroiled in the tale.Bradley, p. 87 One reviewer said that the production supplied \\"Belly laughs, baronets and more than a touch of Blackadder\\".Hanning, Elaine. \\"The Ghosts of Ruddigore: Belly laughs, baronets and more than a touch of Blackadder\\", Jersey Evening Post, 19 June 2002Darvell, Michael. \\"Theatre Reviews: The Ghosts of Ruddigore\\", What's On (London), 4 September 2002, p. 51 Next was The Mikado (1998). The company's updated adaptation is set in a hip tailor/design shoppe and inspired by the sexy, flashy world of fashion. As Clarke described the genesis of the production, he was in New York City over Christmas 1997 and visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which was showing a special exhibition of the work of Gianni Versace. \\"I was confronted with a dress; a cheeky mini-crinoline, sexy and sassy, classical and witty. The startling originality, colour and fun of it hit me like a blow – imagine three of these – the three little maids! Remembering that Ko-Ko, before his elevation to Lord High Executioner, had been a cheap tailor.... the germ of an idea started. Why not make Ko-Ko a designer? ... a Jean-Paul Gaultier – camp, outrageous, and bursting with creativity and invention. This gave the green light to filling the stage with all sorts of over-the-top theatrical fashion creations\\". Clarke engaged fashion designer Gabriella Csanyi-Wills to create the costume designs; she originated the idea to make the second act set, Ko-Ko's garden, out of fabric. Clarke decided that Katisha would be based on the older women in Dallas or Dynasty. \\"Women long past the first flush of youth, but determined not to grow old gracefully. ... [If] she becomes a sympathetic character, the whole plot collapses. But the ridiculous picture of a woman in love with a man half her age is one we are all familiar with ... the key to what makes Katisha pitiful.\\" This production, featuring Simon Butteriss as Ko-Ko and the Opera Babes as Yum-Yum and Pitti-Sing, also became a success, and theatres were eager to book it. One new opportunity for the company was the chance to showcase the production at the 1999 Covent Garden Festival – the company's first London performances – and at subsequent Covent Garden Festivals. The production continued to be very popular on repeated tours.Beale, Robert. Review: The Mikado, Manchester Evening News, p. 10, 18 January 2008 =Pinafore and later= The company performed several times at the Buxton Opera House, former home of the International G&S; Festival H.M.S. Pinafore was first presented in 2001 on the QE2 cruise ship and sailed as far as Australia. Clarke's adaptation was designed to meet the ship's one-hour time limit for entertainments. This was repeated in subsequent seasons on the H.M.S. President, a ship moored on the River Thames that doubled as the Festival Club for the Covent Garden Festival (Julia Goss played Little Buttercup), and in 2002 on a different cruise ship with both Pinafore and Mikado. In the energetic opening scene of Pinafore, the company erects the H.M.S. Pinafore right before the audience. Clarke noted, \\"Many an old sailor, when his sea-faring days were over, worked on the fly floor of a theatre ... used to signal cues to fly the scenery by whistling. That is the origin of the theatrical superstition that it is bad luck to whistle in the dressing room. ... I wanted to find some visual way of showing this connection, so to have the sailors \\"flying\\" the scenery by pulling the ropes and tying them off would be a great trick. The company's typically zany version of Pinafore is played in Victorian dress with few textual and musical changes from the original.Beale, Robert. \\"Luna-tic Pinafore is a shore-fire triumph\\", Manchester Evening News, 25 March 2009.\\"Fun on the high seas\\". The Press and Journal, 22 April 2010, accessed 27 April 2010 The company has performed all of its Gilbert and Sullivan productions at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival nearly every year since 2003 as well as touring them extensively.Lewis, Peter. \\"Pirates are such a curtain raiser!\\", Hexham Courant, 19 October 2007 Another G&S-related; piece is The Burglar's Opera, with a script by Stephen Wyatt, based on W. S. Gilbert's 1890 short story, Burglar's Story, mixed with elements of The Threepenny Opera. The music was adapted by Jeff Clarke from Arthur Sullivan's orchestral music. This toured in 2005 and 2006.Gillan, Don. \\"The Burglars Opera\\", stagebeauty.net, 2006, accessed 4 November 2009 In 2007, Clarke introduced a new piece called Nightmare Songs in which Simon Butteriss plays an understudy to the principal comedian of a fictionalised D'Oyly Carte Opera Company during World War II and must be ready to go on at very short notice to play in any of ten G&S; patter roles.

The Sorcerer at The Oxford Playhouse. Oxford Theatre Review, 15 June 2011 Other repertory Offenbach works Early on, the year after its first success with The Parson's Pirates, the company produced a Donizetti adaptation, Lucia, The Bride of Lammermoor. As it turned out, the opera would be the company's only non-comic piece, and Clarke decided that the company was better off making a name for itself through its zany comic productions than competing in the standard repertoire against the other small touring British opera companies. After introducing its first three Gilbert and Sullivan productions, the company turned to other works, as Clarke feared that it would become identified exclusively as a G&S; company. In 1997, when the Royal Opera House had to close for renovations, they presented a season at the Shaftesbury Theatre, including some lighter works, such as a new production of The Merry Widow with a translation by Jeremy Sams. It was not a success, and the Royal Opera agreed to license the translation to Opera della Luna after having seen the company's Mikado at the Covent Garden Festival. The company first played the piece at the Covent Garden Festival in 2000 and later toured it extensively, often to larger theatres. The company's updated chamber adaptation included naughty puppets three years before Avenue Q opened. Clarke recalled, \\"Shadow puppets for Valencienne and [Camille] in the pavilion required some restraint from Miss Knight and Mr [Carl] Sanderson, who were only too ready to make their assignation more graphic than Lehár intended. But the \\"grisettes\\" [were] life-size puppets – dazzlingly costumed in frills and feathers and prepared to reveal far more than any chorus girls had previously done.\\" Iford Manor, home of the Iford Arts Festival In 2003, the Iford Arts Festival commissioned the company to create a chamber version of Offenbach's La Belle Helene, which the company later toured. Belsey returned, and Simon Butteriss made his debut with the company; they have both played many seasons for Opera della Luna, particularly in the Gilbert and Sullivan productions. Clarke did not tell the festival organizers what he had planned: \\"The show was rude. It contained not a few four letter words; the cast handed out Viagra to the audience in the last act; and most alarmingly, in the celebrated Act 2 Helen and Paris duet 'Am I but dreaming?'\\", the mezzo-soprano was topless. The audiences were enthusiastic, and the piece toured. Iford later commissioned productions of Robinson Crusoé (2004), a scaled-down version of The Tales of Hoffmann (2005) and Clarke's Lucia. Clark wrote of these years, \\"The early part of the year would be work on QE2 ... followed by the company's spring tour. Summer would be taken up with preparations and performances for Iford and [the International G&S; Festival at] Buxton. There would be an extensive autumn tour from September to early November, and then the company would perform its annual Christmas pantomime at the Corn Exchange Newbury.\\" The company's pantomimes has begun in 1995 which performed, in Christmas seasons, Dick Whittington and his Cat, Aladdin, Sleeping Beauty, Puss in Boots, Cinderella, Robinson Crusoe (some of them twice). The last was Robin Hood in 2003–2004. Clarke felt that these productions enhanced the reputation of the company, and \\"the chance to create exciting music theatre for children was one we relished.\\" In 2006, at Iford, the company revived Il mondo della luna. Clarke's English translation hews closely to the original libretto, but some material is cut.Theatre programme for Il mondo della luna, Iford Arts, June 2007 The next year, the company produced a new English version of Donizetti's L'Elisir d'Amore set at a health spa.Christiansen, Rupert. \\"Elixir just as potent in the Northern smoke\\", The Telegraph, 26 June 2006Evans, Rian. \\"L'Elisir d'amore at Iford Manor, Bradford-on-Avon\\", Musical Opinion, September/October 2007, accessed 16 November 2009 In 2008, the company toured Verdi's Un giorno di regno (\\"King for a Day\\"). In Clarke's broad English adaptation, the story is moved to post-war Italy around the reign of Umberto II, infused with elements of organised crime, and political humour is added. One reviewer commented that the production \\"makes up for what it lacks in bel canto elegance by being a riotously funny, enormously enjoyable evening's entertainment\\".Shirley, Hugo. \\"Verdi: Un giorno di regno\\", Musical Criticism, 26 July 2008, accessed 15 November 2009 In 2009, the company toured its version of Strauss's Die Fledermaus in Clarke's English translation.

Musical Opinion wrote, \\"Who needs grand opera when you can have Opera della Luna? The scale of their performances ... is so small as to be minuscule, but they are so skilfully conceived and realised as to be totally engaging. In their way, they are every bit as rewarding as far more ambitious, not to say pretentious stagings.

A review of the company's 2009 adaptation of The Sorcerer in Bucks Free Press stated, \\"Opera Della Luna is innovative, imaginative and inventive. Its grasp on musical theatre is astounding and director Jeff Clarke should be applauded for bringing a new spirit of the age to G&S.;\\" Opera Now magazine wrote, in its review of the company's 2009 production of Die Fledermaus: > Jeff Clarke's Rocky Horror version of The Bat ... turned out to be rather > brilliant, not to mention hilarious....

History The museum first opened in 1975 when the Isle of Man Road Services, a subsidiary of the railway company, relocated to their new garage, which still exists today at the foot of the main platform. At that time, the railway operated only between Port Erin and Castletown, in an experimental season with the goal of reducing running costs. The following year, services were extended to Ballasalla, then returned to Douglas in 1977, after which the full line has operated. The museum building, originally consisting of a metal frame with asbestos cladding, was extensively rebuilt in 1999. A souvenir shop was subsequently added in the goods shed, where locomotives were originally kept overnight. Prior to the museum's opening, the original locomotive shed was used to store unserviceable locomotives. When the museum was rebuilt, the locomotive shed was returned to its original use and the goods shed converted into a shop area and a new porch added. Location right The museum is situated beside the Port Erin railway station which is the southern terminus of the railway, on Station Road in the village, on its junction with Strand Road which leads to the beach. The original entrance was situated on the corner of these two roads, latterly made into a public seating area. The main exhibition hall is housed in a converted bus garage that once belonged to Isle of Man Road Services, itself a division of the old railway company which was nationalised in 1976. Since the museum was extensively rebuilt in 1998-1999 part of the old goods shed has been incorporated into the complex, the other locomotive shed still being used as a workshop to maintain the locomotives and for overnight storage purposes. The museum is accessible from the station platform off the train, or by car parking in the nearby car park. Shop & Opening Times No.16 Viewed From No.6 The souvenir shop is in the entrance / exit area to the museum itself and is accessed via Station Road at the foot of the platform. The shop has a small range of memorabilia including books, postcards, stationery, ephemera, replica nameplates and generic souvenirs. The stock of the shop is now a fraction of what was available in the boom of the centenary seasons beginning with the Year of Railways in 1993 and extending to Steam 125 in 1998. A nominal admission price is charged for entry and the opening times tie in with the operational dates of the railway itself. The shop is in the old goods shed and features a station-type building as a staff/store room as well as old luggage trolleys and framed displays before entering the museum proper. The museum is open daily throughout the summer months, at the same time as the railway which is usually between March and the beginning of November each year. A small admission price is charged for entry for those not in possession of a valid railway ticket. Exhibits Peveril (Beyer Peacock, 1875) Governor's Saloon F.75 Bodies Built 1873 Chassis-Mounted 1923 Since it originally opened in 1975, the railway museum has housed a variety of major exhibits. Exhibits in the museum include two engines and two coaches as well as other equipment from the railway. The royal carriages, as used by HM Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in 1963 and by HM Queen Elizabeth II in 1972, are preserved in the museum. There is also a large display of photographs, posters and other memorabilia. In addition to the framed exhibits of old posters and the like, further displays are mounted on the walls of the station building itself in the waiting room and booking office. These were once part of the museum and donated by a preservationists group when the facility was first opened. * No.1 Sutherland of 1873 (Arrived 1976, Removed 1997, Returned 2020) * No.4 Loch of 1874, Arrived 1997, Removed 2001) * No. 6 Peveril of 1875 (Arrived 2002, Removed 2020 For Asbestos Removal) * No. 16 Mannin of 1926 (Arrived 1975, Removed 2020 For Assessment) * F. 75 The Governor's Saloon (Arrived 1975, Extant) * F.36 The Queen's Saloon (Arrived 1976, Extant) * N.42 Six-Wheeled Carriage (Arrived 1976, Removed 1998) * Manx Northern Van Gr.12 of 1879 (Arrived 1976, Removed 1998) * Former Brake Van G.19 of 1921 (Arrived 2013, Extant) * Workshops' Wood-Turning Lathe (Arrived 1988, Extant) * Original (1873) Carriage Door (Arrived 2004, Extant) * Mock-Up Station Masters' Office (Created 1999, Relocated 2019) * Permanent Way Diorama Display (Created 2013, Extant) *Wagons H.1 & M.78 (Various Times, Between Usage) Mannin has been an attraction since the museum opened in 1975 and was only removed for one season in 1998–99 whilst the structure of the museum building received attention; since returning it has been turned to face chimney-first to Douglas and is no longer rail-connected.

It lasted from 1415, when King Henry V of England invaded Normandy, to 1453, when the English lost Bordeaux. It followed a long period of peace from the end of the Caroline War in 1389. The phase was named after the House of Lancaster, the ruling house of the Kingdom of England, to which Henry V belonged. The first half of this phase of the war was dominated by the Kingdom of England. Initial English successes, notably at the famous Battle of Agincourt, coupled with divisions among the French ruling class, allowed the English to gain control of large parts of France. In 1420, the Treaty of Troyes was signed, by which the English king married the French princess Catherine and was made regent of the kingdom and heir to the throne of France. A victory on paper was thus achieved by the English, with their claims now having legal standing. Some of the French nobility refused to recognise the agreement, however, and so military subjugation was still necessary to enforce its provisions. King Henry V and, after his death, his brother John, Duke of Bedford, brought the English to the height of their power in France, with an English king crowned in Paris. The second half of this phase of the war was dominated by the Kingdom of France. With charismatic leaders such as Joan of Arc and La Hire, and with England losing its main allies, the French forces counterattacked. Charles VII of France was crowned in Notre-Dame de Reims in 1429, and from then a slow but steady reconquest of English-held French territories ensued. Ultimately the English would be expelled from France and lose all of their continental territories, except the Pale of Calais (which would be re-captured by the French in 1558). The Battle of Castillon (1453) was the final action of the Hundred Years' War, but France and England remained formally at war until the Treaty of Picquigny in 1475. English, and later British monarchs would continue to nominally claim the French throne until 1801, though they would never again seriously pursue it. England resumes the war Henry V of England asserted a claim of inheritance through the female line, with female agency and inheritance recognised in English law but prohibited in France by the Salic law of the Salian Franks. He thus would succeed to the claim of his great-grandfather, Edward III of England, through his mother, to the French throne - the claim that the court of France rejected in favour of a more distant but male-line successor, Philip VI. On his accession in 1413, Henry V pacified the realm by conciliating the remaining enemies of the House of Lancaster, and suppressing the heresy of the Lollards. In 1415, Henry V invaded France and captured Harfleur. Decimated by diseases, Henry's army marched to Calais to withdraw from the French campaign. French forces harassed the English, but refrained from making an open battle while amassing their numbers. The French finally gave battle at Agincourt, which proved to be the third great English victory of the Hundred Years' War, and an overwhelming disaster for the French. The Armagnac and Burgundian factions of the French court began negotiations to unite against the foreign enemy. Notable leaders of the Armagnac faction, such as Charles, Duke of Orléans, John I, Duke of Bourbon, and Arthur de Richemont (brother of the Duke of Brittany), became prisoners in England. The Burgundians, under John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, had conserved their forces, not having fought at Agincourt, but the duke's younger brothers—Anthony, Duke of Brabant and Philip II, Count of Nevers—died at that battle. At a meeting between the Dauphin Charles and John the Fearless, the Duke of Burgundy was assassinated by the Dauphin's followers, forcing the duke's son and successor into an alliance with the English. The Anglo-Burgundian alliance leads to the Treaty of Troyes Henry V made a formal alliance with Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, who had taken Paris, after the Armagnac assassination of John of Burgundy in 1419. They forced the mad king Charles VI to sign the Treaty of Troyes, by which Henry would marry Charles' daughter Catherine of Valois and Henry and his heirs would inherit the throne of France, disinheriting the Dauphin Charles. Henry formally entered Paris later that year and the agreement was ratified by the French Estates-General. Earlier that year an English army under the command of the Earl of Salisbury, ambushed and destroyed a Franco-Scottish force at Fresnay 20 miles north of Le Mans (March 1420). According to a chronicler, the French and Scottish lost 3000 men, their camp and its contents including the Scottish treasury. In 1421, an English army of 4,000 was defeated by a Franco-Scottish army of 5000 at the Battle of Baugé. During the battle Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence, brother of Henry V, was killed. Anglo-Burgundian armies' acute pressure on the Armagnac party and Dauphin Charles On his deathbed, Henry V detailed his plans for the war after his death. Henry bade his followers to continue the war until the Treaty of Troyes had been recognised in all of France; the Duke of Burgundy must be offered the regency of France, with Bedford as substitute should he decline; the Burgundian alliance must be preserved at all costs; the Duke of Orléans and some other prisoners must be retained until Henry's son had come of age. There would be no treaty with the Dauphin unless Normandy would be confirmed as an English possession. Bedford adhered to his brother's will, and the Burgundian alliance was preserved as long as he lived. After Henry's early death in 1422, almost simultaneously with that of his father-in- law, his baby son was crowned King Henry VI of England and II of France. The Armagnacs did not acknowledge Henry and remained loyal to Charles VI's son, the dauphin Charles. The war thus continued in central France. In 1423, the Earl of Salisbury completely defeated another Franco-Scottish force at Cravant on the banks of the Yonne river. He personally led the crossing of the river, successfully assaulting a very strong enemy position, and in the resulting battle the Scots took very heavy losses. The same year saw a French victory at the Battle of La Brossinière. The following year, Bedford won what has been described as a \\"second Agincourt\\" at Verneuil when his army destroyed a Franco-Scottish army estimated at 16,000 men. This was not a victory of the longbow for advances in plate armour had given armoured cavalry a much greater measure of protection. The heat of August meant the English archers could not implant their stakes, which led to the archers of one flank being swept away. However the English men-at-arms stood firm and waded into their enemy. Assisted by a flank attack from archers from the other wing, they destroyed the allied army. The Scots were surrounded on the field and annihilated, virtually to the last man. Approximately 6500 died there, including all their commanders. As a result, no large-scale Scottish force landed in France again. The French were also subjected to heavy punishment, as their leaders were killed on the field and the rank and file were killed or mostly dispersed. The following five years witnessed the peak of English power, extending from the Channel to the Loire, excluding only Orléans and Angers, and from Brittany in the west to Burgundy in the east. This was achieved with ever-decreasing resources of man-power.  Joan of Arc's appearance and coronation of Charles VII By 1428, the English were laying siege to Orléans, one of the most heavily defended cities in Europe, with more cannons than the French. However one of the French cannons managed to kill the English commander, the Earl of Salisbury. The English force maintained several small fortresses around the city, concentrated in areas where the French could move supplies into the city. In 1429, Joan of Arc convinced the Dauphin to send her to the siege, saying she had received visions from God telling her to drive out the English. She raised the morale of the local troops and they attacked the English redoubts, forcing the English to lift the siege. At the same time, the French king had updated and enhanced his army and took advantage of the lack of common goal between allies. Inspired by Joan, the French took several English strong points on the Loire and then broke through English archers at Patay commanded by John Fastolf and John Talbot. This victory helped Joan to convince the Dauphin to march to Reims for his coronation as Charles VII. Although a number of other cities were opened to Charles in the march to Reims and after, Joan never managed to capture Paris, equally well defended as Orléans. She was captured during the siege of Compiègne by English allies, the Burgundian faction. Joan was transferred to the English, tried by an ecclesiastic court headed by the pro-English Pierre Cauchon, and executed. Desertion of Burgundy and French victory Bedford was the only person that kept Burgundy in the English alliance. Burgundy was not on good terms with Bedford's younger brother, Gloucester. At Bedford's death in 1435, Burgundy deemed himself excused from the English alliance, and signed the Treaty of Arras, restoring Paris to Charles VII of France. His allegiance remained fickle, but their focus on expanding their domains into the Low Countries left them little energy to intervene in France. The death of Bedford at the same time removed the one uniting force on the English side, while the end of the alliance of Burgundy signaled the decline of England's dominance in France. The long truces that marked the war also gave Charles time to reorganise his army and government, replacing his feudal levies with a more modern professional army that could put its superior numbers to good use, and centralising the French state. A repetition of Du Guesclin's battle avoidance strategy paid dividends and the French were able to recover town after town. By 1449, the French had retaken Rouen. In 1450, the Count of Clermont and Arthur de Richemont, Earl of Richmond, of the Montfort family (the future Arthur III, Duke of Brittany) caught an English army attempting to relieve Caen at the Battle of Formigny and defeated it. The English army was attacked from the flank and rear by Richemont's force just as they were on the verge of beating Clermont's army. The French proceeded to capture Caen on July 6 and Bordeaux and Bayonne in 1451. The attempt by Talbot to retake Guyenne, though initially welcomed by the locals, was crushed by Jean Bureau and his cannons at the Battle of Castillon in 1453 where Talbot had led a small Anglo-Gascon force in a frontal attack on an entrenched camp. This is considered the last battle of the Hundred Years' War.

The term is a portmanteau word, combining \\"pull\\" and \\"extrusion\\". As opposed to extrusion, which pushes the material, pultrusion pulls the material.  History  A very early pultrusions type patent was filed by J.H. Watson in 1944. This was followed by M.J. Meek’s filing of 1950. The first commercial pultrusions were provided by Glastic Company of Cleveland, Ohio under the patent filed in 1952 by Rodger B. White. The patent issued to W. B. Goldsworthy in 1959 helped initiate the promotion and knowledge spread within the industry. W. Brandt Goldsworthy is widely regarded as the inventor of pultrusion.\\"Brandt Goldsworthy: Composites Visionary\\" Parallel to the work of Goldsworthy, who concentrated his work on unsaturated polyester resins, Ernst Kühne in Germany developed a quite similar process in 1954 based on epoxy resin. Invention, development and the issuance of patents continue in the pultrusion field through today. A later innovation in this field has been developed and patented by Thomas GmbH + Co. Technik + Innovation KG in Germany 2008 and is described below.  Process  Diagram of the pultrusion process. 1 – Continuous roll of reinforced fibers/woven fiber mat 2 – Tension roller 3 – Resin Impregnator 4 – Resin soaked fiber 5 – Die and heat source 6 – Pull mechanism 7 – Finished hardened fiber reinforced polymer In the standard pultrusion process the reinforcement materials like fibers or woven or braided strands are impregnated with resin, possibly followed by a separate preforming system, and pulled through a heated stationary die where the resin undergoes polymerization. The impregnation is either done by pulling the reinforcement through a bath or by injecting the resin into an injection chamber which typically is connected to the die. Many resin types may be used in pultrusion including polyester, polyurethane, vinylester and epoxy. Resin provides the resistance to the environment, (i.e., the corrosion resistance, the UV resistance, the impact resistance, etc.) and the glass provides strength, in addition to safety from fire. A surface veil can also be added to protect against erosion or “fiber bloom” and provide corrosion resistance and ultraviolet resistance. http://www.libertypultrusions.com/pultrusion-process/ The technology is not limited to thermosetting polymers. More recently, pultrusion has been successfully used with thermoplastic matrices such as polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) either by powder impregnation of the glass fiber or by surrounding it with sheet material of the thermoplastic matrix, which is then heated. Ecological cleanness of manufactured products, in contrast to composites on thermosetting resins base, as well as practically unlimited possibilities of recycling (processing) after the resource depletion appear to be forcible arguments in favor of reinforced thermoplastics. For these reasons the industrial output and use of the given materials in highly industrialized countries have increased by 8–10% per year in recent decades. New developments (see process modifications) which enable the manufacturing not only of straight but also curved profiles are actually pushing the demand for this technology, especially in the automotive sector. Pultrusion technology of manufacturing of fiber composites with polymer matrix appears to be energy-efficient and resource-saving. Economic and environmental factors favor use of a thermoplastic matrix but due to the high viscosity of melts it is difficult to achieve high productivity and high quality of fiberfills impregnation with this type of matrix. Products manufactured under this technology are widely used in the following industries: * In the agriculture and chemical industries for manufacturing of chemically resistant to aggressive media slatted floors with enhanced strength characteristics used in the construction of livestock facilities, chemical plants, etc.; * in the construction industry for the production of glass-fiber reinforcement, profiles, carcasses, stiffening bars for PVC-windows, etc.; * in the aerospace industry for manufacturing of structure components of aircraft; * in the sports and tourism industries for manufacturing of equipment exhibiting enhanced strength properties: skis, ski poles, golf course flagsticks, tent and hovel constructions, etc.; * in electrical power engineering for manufacturing of dielectric structures, fiberglass rods used in composite insulators and as supporting structures for elements of signaling blocks, and fiberglass profiles used in manufacturing of transformers and electric motors; * in commercial production, using grains of long-fiber molding material (LLM) as a raw material for subsequent manufacturing of structures and products with enhanced strength and chemical properties; * in the automotive industry for the production of structural and complex parts of the vehicles with enhanced stiffness, rigidity and lightness; * and boxer in many other industries and plants, using mechanisms, structures and materials, which meet high standards of chemical, dielectric and strength stability.  Process modifications  As the materials are pulled through a die in the standard pultrusion process the process is only suited to manufacture straight profiles. In a recently developed modification of the process, developed and patented by Thomas GmbH + Co. Technik + Innovation KG, the die is no longer stationary but moving back and forth along the profile to be manufactured. This modified process, known as \\"Radius-Pultrusion\\" allows also to manufacture two- and three-dimensional curved profiles. It also is beneficiary for a number of tasks in the linear process especially if quite complex textile reinforcements with a low rate of distortion are needed. Flexible pultruded 3D-profile Process Steps Radius-Pultrusion  Equipment  The design of pultrusion machines varies. Two often used types are reciprocating (hand-over-hand) and continuous (cat-track). For the radius pultrusion process the layout of the machines has two moving stages similar to the hand over hand pulling unit, but as the process is intermittent with only one puller and the mould mounted on the stage of other one. Whether the stages are moving linear or circular depends on the type of profiles to be manufactured. The minimum radius for a linear machine with rotating stages is approx. 2 m. For smaller radii a circular movement of the mould and gripper stage is necessary.

Nuselský most spanning the valley as seen from walls of Vyšehrad. Nusle () is a district of Prague. It became part of the city in 1922. Location Part of Nusle is in Prague 2 while most is in Prague 4. Nusle is located south of the city centre in Nuselské údolí (Nusle Valley) on the Botič brook. It borders Vyšehrad to the west, the New Town and Vinohrady to the north and Vršovice to the east. The southern part of Nusle, on a plain above the valley, is known as Pankrác for the St. Pankratz church. History The first written evidence of Nusle, as a village, dates back to the 11th century. It is recorded as Neosvětly, Nostuly, Nusle, Neosvitly or Neovstlí in the Middle Ages and the bulk of its territory consisted of vineyards (Vallis Vinarium or Valis vinearum), wine houses, mills by the Botič stream, homesteads (Bučanka, Belka, Terebovka, Reitknechtka, Formanka), a coaching inn, a lodge, and the St. Pankratz church in the part of Nusle named Krušina, residential farm houses in Lower and Upper Nusle, a meat market, and from the 17th century a mansion and brewery. Prior to 1750 there was an estate outside the mansion buildings comprising 35 houses. It was not until 1797, when colonel nobleman James Wimmer bought Nusle that the rural character disappeared.

It was connected to Prague in the era of president Masaryk in 1922. At present Nusle has over 1,700 addresses. Points of interest Points of interest in the town are the Nusle Town Hall from the year 1908, the Nusle brewery from 1694, and the parish church of St. Wenceslaus built in 1899. Czechoslovak president T.G. Masaryk visited the Nusle Town Hall three times during his time in office. The new Sokol Nusle Hall with the gymnasium was built near the Town Hall in 1925, and old Sokol Nusle Hall from 1888 has rebuilt on the Czechoslovak Church in this year (from 1971 \\"hussites\\"). Also in Nusle is the Nusle Bridge, one of the largest in the Czech Republic, connecting the opposite sides of the valley. It is known for having many people commit suicide by jumping from it since 1973.

It presently comprises a large section of northern Florida, including the entire counties of Alachua, Clay, Putnam, Bradford, and Union, along with the majority of Marion County. The cities of Gainesville and Palatka are in the district as well as part of Ocala (its northern suburbs). Some Jacksonville suburbs such as Middleburg, Green Cove Springs, and Orange Park are also in the district. Redistricting in Florida, effective for the 2012 federal elections, radically altered the nature of the 3rd district. From 1993 through 2012 the district called the 3rd district comprised an entirely different territory, roughly similar to the 5th district . Likewise the present territory of the new 3rd district, as of the 2012 elections, is made up of parts of the former 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th districts, though it is geographically similar to the pre-2013 6th district. The former 3rd district was (and present 5th district is) an intentionally gerrymandered territory designed to unite disparate areas of northeastern Florida with significant African-American populations into a black-majority district, and was overwhelmingly Democratic in voting patterns. The new 3rd district has a majority white population, largely in rural areas and small towns. The only cities of any size in the district are Gainesville and Ocala. The district has been represented by Republican Ted Yoho since 2013. Yoho is not running for re-election in 2020. The old 3rd district was represented from 1993 through 2012 by Corrine Brown, who was elected to the similar new 5th district in the November 2012 elections. The 1993–2012 black majority district The old 3rd district was a gerrymandered congressional district. The district included portions of Alachua, Clay, Duval, Lake, Marion, Orange, Putnam, Seminole, and Volusia counties. History While Florida has had at least three congressional districts since the 1900 U.S. Census, the 1993–2012 3rd congressional district dates to reapportionment done by the Florida Legislature after the 1990 U.S. Census. Because Florida has a large population of African Americans, but not a large enough concentration anywhere in the state to easily configure a congressional district with a majority, there were several attempts to create a few gerrymandered districts which were certain to elect an African American candidate. This created an odd coalition of black Democrats and Republicans who supported such districts (since this not only created black-majority districts, but also made \\"safer\\" Republican districts elsewhere). This effort was opposed by many white Democrats, but eventually this idea won the support of the state legislature and this district was created as a result. The 1993–2012 3rd congressional district was geographically diverse. Starting from the southern part of the district, it included the Pine Hills area of the Orlando-Kissimmee Metropolitan Area with small pockets of African-American neighborhoods in the cities of Sanford, Gainesville, Palatka, and finally the larger African American communities of Jacksonville. Connecting these areas were regions which are sparsely populated—either expansive rural areas or narrow strips which are only a few miles wide. Barack Obama received 73% of the vote in this district in the 2008 Presidential election.

It is also called the Land van Waas (Land of Waas); Waas most likely refers to the soggy soil of the region although the exact etymology is unknown. One possibility is a connection to the English word \\"wasteland\\". The swamps that characterized it have long been drained although many fields are still noticeably convex; the result of many years of plowing the topsoil towards the center to improve drainage. Historically, on account of its waterlogged, poor soils the region was thinly populated in comparison to the rest of Belgium and agriculture was by necessity based on holder farms using innovative techniques not usually applied elsewhere even if the farmers had ready markets nearby in the cities of Ghent and Antwerp. Charles Townshend (1674–1748), one of the proponents of the early agricultural revolution, was an explicit advocate of agricultural practices first developed here in Belgium, such as the use of turnips in crop rotation, and the region for some time attracted study trips by early agriculturists in his wake.

MUA confers upon its graduates the Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree. Students at MUA are primarily from the US and Canada and return to those countries to practice medicine. A typical incoming class at MUA is about 80–90 students. MUA also offers a one- semester, Gateway Medical,pre-medical program for students who need to meet additional course requirements to be considered for the M.D. program.  Curriculum  The Lorraine Hanley-Browne Library to the left along with the Main Classroom building to the right.  Basic Science Curriculum  In the first five semesters--the Basic Science curriculum--MUA has implemented the integrated, organ-systems-based approach to learning that parallels the training that is provided at many U.S. medical schools. These first five semesters take place on the campus in Nevis. The instruction emphasizes the correlation of foundational concepts in the basic sciences with their direct clinical applications. An important part of the MUA curriculum is the focus on preparation for the critical licensing exams required to become a practicing MD, beginning with the USMLE Step 1 exam.  Research Literature Review & Analysis Module  During the fifth semester, MUA students complete a \\"Research: Literature Review and Analysis\\" module which is designed to further develop the ability to evaluate and assimilate scientific evidence and reinforce the skills for critically appraising and communicating medical knowledge. Students analyze a current and complex medical care question using evidence from published medical literature. In preparing the paper, students work independently under the guidance of a faculty mentor. Each paper is evaluated by a faculty committee. A number of students have had their papers published in medical journals and report that their research played a role in obtaining a residency appointment.  Clinical Curriculum  For the clinical curriculum, semesters 6-10, MUA students return to the U.S. or Canada to complete five semesters of clinical rotations at ACGME-approved teaching hospitals that are affiliated with MUA. The Clinical Medicine program at MUA is 72 weeks: * 42 weeks of required core rotations in Surgery, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, and Obstetrics and Gynecology.  Pre- medical Program  For students that lack the pre-medical education requirements--possibly because they decided to focus on medicine late in their undergraduate experience or are drawn to medicine after entering the work world--MUA offers a comprehensive Pre-Medical Program on its campus in Nevis. Accreditation On July 27, 2017, Medical Board of California voted to approve and recognize the Medical University of the Americas, Nevis. The approval recognizes credentials of students who matriculated as from May 2015 onward when the new curriculum was implemented. MUA is accredited by the government of St. Kitts & Nevis Accreditation Board. MUA is listed in the FAIMER International Medical Education Directory (IMED) and in the AVICENNA Directory for medicine. MUA is approved by the New York State Education Department for clinical training, residency, and licensure in New York. MUA is accredited by the Accreditation Commission of Colleges of Medicine. MUA has received a comparability determination from the National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation (NCFMEA) MUA has received approval by The Commission for Independent Education, and Florida Department of Education for licensure.

In May 1969, Rackley, 19, was suspected by other Panthers of being a police informant. He was brought to Panther headquarters in New Haven, Connecticut, held captive and tortured there for several days, \\"tried\\" in kangaroo court, condemned to death, taken to the wetlands of Middlefield, Connecticut, and murdered there.Bass, Paul, and Rae, Douglas, Murder in the Model City, Basic Books 2006, p. 23 His killing was the crime at the center of the 1970 New Haven Black Panther trials. Background By the late 1960s, the Black Panther Party for self-defense knew that they were a primary target of local and federal law enforcement officials, who sought to infiltrate the movement with informants. In September 1968, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover described the Black Panthers as the \\"greatest threat to the internal security of the country\\".Black Panther Party Retrieved on April 13, 2007\\" By 1969, the Black Panthers were the primary target of the FBI's COINTELPRO, and the target of 233 of 295 authorized \\"Black Nationalist\\" COINTELPRO actions. Death In 1968 Alex Rackley left his home state of Florida and moved to New York City. There, he became involved with the Black Panther Party, but his role seems to have been limited to giving classes in martial arts. In the spring of 1969, Rackley came under suspicion. His loyalty was questioned, and rumors circulated that he was passing information about the Panthers to the FBI. The situation was exacerbated by the presence of two national Panther figures from the California headquarters: Field Marshal George Sams, Jr., and Landon Williams. The two men had arrived on the east coast in May with the intention of instilling \\"discipline\\" into the party. On May 18, Rackley was forcibly brought to the headquarters of the New Haven chapter of the Black Panthers at 365 Orchard Street, which was also the residence of Warren Kimbro, a New Haven Panther. In the bedroom normally occupied by Kimbro's seven-year-old daughter,Bass and Rae, Murder in the Model City, p. 5 Rackley was tied to the bed and questioned under torture. The principal method of torture was the pouring of boiling water over his torso, shoulders, and thighs. Finally, after two days of this treatment, according to witnesses, Rackley confessed to the accusations. The veracity of his confession has never been confirmed. Late on the night of the 20th, Rackley was removed, still alive, from the apartment by Sams, Kimbro, and a third Panther, Lonnie McLucas, of Bridgeport, Connecticut. The men borrowed a car from one of their supporters and drove Rackley to the marshy wetlands of nearby Middlefield. On Sams's orders, Kimbro shot Rackley in the head, and McLucas shot him again, in the chest. They dumped the body in the Coginchaug River and left.Bass and Rae, Murder in the Model City, pp. 10-12 Investigation and raid The Panthers had become subject to police infiltration, as the New Haven police had successfully penetrated the Panther movement with informants, and on the night of the killing, investigators already suspected that some kind of internal party \\"discipline\\" was under way. In fact, the \\"supporter\\" from whom the murderers had borrowed their car for the killing was being paid by the New Haven Police Department to report on Panther activity, and he called his controller that night to alert the police that Sams was using his car.Bass and Rae, Murder in the Model City, pp. 5-6 According to later testimony, officers followed the vehicle when it left New Haven but reported losing track of the car on its way to the murder scene. Rackley's body was discovered later that morning by 23-year-old factory worker John Mroczka, who had stopped his motorcycle near a bridge on Route 147 to check out a favorite trout-fishing spot on the river bank. State police recovered the body. Rackley's wrists were tied with gauze, his neck was wrapped in a noose made from a wire coat hanger; there were extensive burns on wide areas of his chest, wrists, buttocks, thighs, and right shoulder. He had also been beaten around his face, groin, and lumbar region with a hard object. In his jacket pocket was a note to Bobby Seale, the Panthers' national chairman, from Ericka Huggins, a prominent New Haven Panther. Seale had been in New Haven to give a speech on the Yale University campus only hours before Rackley was killed. After another police informant from Panther circles identified Rackley's photograph and reported seeing Rackley being tortured, New Haven police raided the home of Warren Kimbro on May 22, arresting Kimbro and Huggins. Sams and McLucas escaped initial arrest but were captured later and brought to Connecticut for trial. Trials Kimbro and Sams both turned state's evidence and admitted their roles in the killing, in exchange for reducing the charges to second degree murder (although that crime carried a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment, both men would be freed after serving four years). McLucas confessed his part in the murder when he was arrested but chose to stand trial and pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and other charges. His and the other defendants' trials became one of the defining battlegrounds for the radical movement, as thousands of re-energized Panthers and pro-Panther protesters poured into New Haven, disrupting city life and school business on the campus of Yale University. Yale president Kingman Brewster, who suspended some of the campus rules in order to dispel tensions in the student body, famously commented that he doubted whether a black revolutionary could get a fair trial in America. Ripples from the case continued to spread when Sams testified that in killing Rackley, he had been acting on direct orders from Bobby Seale, who had stopped by the Orchard Street headquarters on May 20 after his Yale speech. Sams also implicated Ericka Huggins in the decision to execute Rackley. Kimbro did not corroborate Sams's evidence about Seale, and although the FBI and New Haven police gave this investigative angle their full attention, no further evidence of Seale's involvement was found.Bass and Rae, Murder in the Model City, p. 69 Nevertheless, both Seale and Huggins were arrested and held for trial in Connecticut. During his trial, McLucas again admitted firing the second shot into Rackley's body but insisted he had been an unwilling collaborator in the killing. Jurors listened to audio recordings the Panthers had made of Rackley's whimpering, tortured voice during his two days of agony. In September 1970, Lonnie McLucas was found guilty and sentenced to 12 to 15 years in prison. The deliberations of the racially mixed jury, which lasted 33 hours over six days, were the longest in Connecticut history to date, and the jurors acquitted McLucas of other, more serious charges, including a capital charge for kidnapping leading to death. His enormously relieved defense attorney, Theodore Roskoff, declared, \\"The judge was fair, the jury was fair, and, in this case, a black revolutionary was given a fair trial.\\"Justice In New Haven, in Time Magazine, September 14, 1970 In October, Seale and Huggins' trial began. George Sams, the one-time \\"Field Marshal\\", testified again. By this time, Sams was reviled by the Panthers as a traitor and accused of being a renegade psychopath who had killed Rackley on his own and who was pinning the crime on Seale to please his new masters in the \\"Establishment\\". It was even suggested that Sams had been in cahoots with the FBI all along, that he was the real informant and had accused and murdered Rackley to cover his tracks. The jury deadlocked: 11 to 1 for Seale's acquittal and 10 to 2 for Huggins's acquittal. The prosecution declined to retry the case. Legacy Although Seale's prosecution galvanized the American radical left and Seale walked away from the trial without being convicted, the proceedings in New Haven have been called a Pyrrhic victory for the Panthers. The trials had exposed the internal strife and distrust that was undermining the Panther movement and confirmed for the public that the Panthers would resort to extralegal violence when necessary. The influence of the national movement soon waned.Bisbort, Alan, Bobby Seale's Shadow, from gadfly.com. Available at http://www.gadflyonline.com/8-6-01/FTR-bobbyseale2.HTML The case later became a subject of controversy regarding the role of a young Hillary Clinton in the trial. An urban legend, widely spread via the internet by opponents of Clinton's campaign for the US Senate in 2000, claimed that Clinton defended Bobby Seale and helped him beat the murder charge. In fact Clinton, who was then a Yale law student named Hillary Rodham, did not directly serve the defense. Instead, she helped coordinate the efforts of the ACLU to monitor the trial for civil rights violations.

History The congregation was formed in 1841, as a part of the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland's Canadian Synod, and had been served monthly since 1837 from nearby West Flamboro by the UPC's pioneer missionary to the region, Thomas Christie. The congregation first met in a former schoolhouse in downtown Hamilton, with close proximity to two larger Presbyterian congregations, St Andrew's (now St. Paul's), the large Church of Scotland congregation, and MacNab Street Presbyterian Church (Hamilton), the second \\"Free Church\\". It was rebuilt in 1858, and became known as Central Presbyterian Church after the 1875 merger and affiliation within the Presbyterian Church in Canada; the successful union proposals were inaugurated by their former pastor William Ormiston, prior to his move to New York City in 1870. On June 21, 1906, the 1858 building was destroyed in a massive fire, and plans were commenced to rebuild in a new location; the minister's son, John M. Lyle, was architect of the new building, which was opened on June 14, 1908, complemented with a large Casavant Frères pipe organ. Lyle was responsible for Toronto's Royal Alexandra Theatre, the Runnymede branch of the Toronto Public Library and Union Station (Toronto), amongst many other well-known buildings in the region. Central is the only church structure that Lyle designed. Lyle's design for the building was influenced by the Church of St. Martin-in-the-Fields in London and the Congregational Church of Naugatuck, Connecticut, and is unusual in having a flat roof, thereby resembling more the public buildings favoured by the École des Beaux-Arts than the traditional European church. Nevertheless, the church's interior is dominated by a series of traditional stained-glass windows portraying episodes from the Bible. Central's spire, which is illuminated at night, is a distinctive landmark visible throughout the surrounding neighbourhoods, as well as from the top of the nearby Niagara Escarpment. In 1925, the congregation voted narrowly (398-381) to remain within the Presbyterian Church in Canada. The Minister, Rev. William Sedgewick, and many members left for the United Church of Canada. Two members of Central Church were appointed to represent the King as Lieutenant Governor of Ontario. These were Sir John Morison Gibson, who served from 1908 to 1914, and Sir John Strathearn Hendrie, who served between 1914 and 1919. Memorial plaques for the two are located on the inside walls of the sanctuary. Even today members of Central Church play prominent roles in the public life and culture of Hamilton, including city government, the arts and higher education, as well as within the Presbyterian Church in Canada. The congregation remains active in downtown Hamilton, and is known for its music programme, its connection with The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, as well as its reputation for lengthy pastorates. The current minister is the Rev. Dr. Gregory Davidson, who was inducted in August 2015. Image gallery References External links * Congregational Website * John M.

She made her first on-screen appearance on 23 October 1989. Tiffany is described as being a little terror and always getting into mischief. She becomes friends with Toby Mangel and manages to get him into trouble too. Tiffany's storylines often saw her tomboyish and mischievous sides come out. She attacks a family of Magpies after being dive bombed by one, she lies to her aunt that Kerry Bishop is mistreating her, she almost drowns after going to the beach and convinces Joe Mangel that he has been cursed. Tiffany departed on 21 June 1990 after deciding to join her parents in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. Characterisation The BBC called Tiffany \\"an absolute little terror.\\" They described her as always cooking up mischief and trying to obtain money or vandalise other people's property. They said \\"this little girl was certainly not made of sugar and spice and all things nice. More like paint-stripper and bleach.\\" Tiffany became friends with Toby Mangel (Finn Greentree-Keane) and through her antics, she managed to get him into trouble. The BBC said that Tiffany's most \\"audacious moment\\" was when she graffitied Paul Robinson's (Stefan Dennis) car. Paul was quite protective of his car and was outraged when he saw what Tiffany had done. The BBC wondered what Tiffany was up to today and believed that she was either \\"Behind bars\\" or running a bank. Storylines Tiffany is the daughter of Russell and Petra McLachlan (Berndardette Wheatley) and sister to Ryan (Richard Norton). As her family were quite affluent, Tiffany appeared to be spoilt and pampered. When Kerry Bishop (Linda Hartley-Clark) begins running a childminding service, Petra places Tiffany in her care. Kerry's stepson, Toby is initially reluctant to become friends with Tiffany, as his friend, Katie Landers (Sally Jensen), had just left for Adelaide. Toby warms to Tiffany after her tomboy persona comes out. She tells Toby to call her Lochy and they become good friends. One day, Lochy and Toby find an empty house and become convinced that it is haunted. However, they discover that a runaway teenager, Lee Maloney (Maree Ackhurst), is living there. They tell Matt Robinson (Ashley Paske) about Lee and he takes her home with him. After a Magpie dive bombs her, Lochy takes a dislike to the group and begins throwing stones at their nest. Toby and Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy) warn her that she will make the birds angry, but Lochy does not listen. Lochy then decides to climb the tree to get to the nest, but when Kerry calls her, she loses her balance and falls from the tree. She is then left with a broken arm. Lochy clashes with her classmate, Natasha Kovac (Courtney Compagnino), who makes Lochy's life miserable. Lochy tells her aunt, Dorothy (Maggie Dence), that Kerry is mistreating her. Dorothy threatens to report Kerry to the Department of Childcare and Lochy admits that she made her story up. Kerry gives up her child care service, but agrees to continue looking after Lochy. Lochy's life is placed in danger when she decides to wag school and go to the beach with Ryan and his girlfriend, Tania Walsh (Angela Nicholls). The couple hitch a lift with Kerry's husband Joe Mangel (Mark Little) and Lochy sneaks onto the back of Joe's ute. Ryan and Tania are angry when they find her. Lochy asks Tania to call her school and pretend she is sick. Ryan then tells Lochy to leave them alone, so he and Tania can be alone. Lochy gets into difficulty in the water, having gone out alone and Ryan pulls her to safety. Lochy is unconscious, but some lifeguards give her CPR and she comes around. Lochy tells everyone to blame her for the accident instead of Ryan, but Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) sacks Ryan from the Coffee Shop. Lochy protests outside the shop, outraging Harold. The Erinsborough News turn up and Harold agrees to re-instate Ryan. Lochy starts having nightmares after witnessing Dorothy knocking down Bouncer. She then contracts the mumps and has to be quarantined. Lochy overhears Dorothy telling Joe that her prized African statue carries a curse if it is ever broken. Lochy breaks the chain around the statue and she runs off. Joe finds the broken chain and believes the curse is real. Lochy tells Dorothy what has happened and Dorothy tells her that she had made the story up. Lochy comes to believe the curse is real though, when a sword falls on Joe. He then begs Dorothy to exorcise the curse and Dorothy has him run outside in his underwear. Lochy admits she broke the chain and asks whether she should go out in her underwear too. Dorothy then admits it was all a joke. When Toby's mother, Noeline (Lindy McConchie) dies, Lochy is very affected by the news. She goes to get some flowers for her mother, but she falls into a fountain at the park when some of the bricks come loose as she picks roses. Lochy tries to offer Toby some support, but he refuses to talk to anyone. Toby pushes Lochy away one day and manages to hurt her. Kerry and Joe force Toby to apologise and he and Lochy became friends again. When their parents go away to Papua New Guinea, Lochy and Ryan move in with Dorothy. Lochy later joins her parents in Port Moresby, when they decide to settle there permanently.

The chairman of the company was Bobby E. Cooper, the CEO was Tom Parker. In 2006 USSC purchased the Coeur, Caladay, and Galena mines from Coeur d'Alene Mines Corporation “Coeur” (NYSE:CDE). The USSC property covers over an area about long east to west and wide. The property contains two mines and one exploration shaft. The operating Galena mine is located near the center of the property position; the Coeur mine, which is on care and maintenance, is about west of the Galena mine; and the Caladay exploration shaft is approximately east of the Galena mine.  History of the district  The Coeur d’Alene Mining District is one of the preeminent silver, lead and zinc producing areas in the world, located near the base of the panhandle of northern Idaho, and has produced over 1 billion ounces of silver. Spokane, Washington, is approximately to the west and Missoula, Montana, is approximately to the east and extends for over in a northwest-southeast direction.  Galena mine  The Galena mine has a long history dating back to 1887. However, recent mining began in 1953 by ASARCO, in an effort to explore and exploit outcrops of silver-lead ore. At that time a shaft was sunk to the 3000 level (3000 feet below the shaft collar) and lateral or level drifts were excavated on the 2800 and 3000 levels. The level drifts accessed down dip projections of the silver-lead ore from above. The development on these levels included, drifting on ore and excavation of raises between the 2800 and 3000 levels and some diamond drilling. The “lead ore” was ready for production in 1953 when a drift crew on the east end of the 3000 level exposed a wide siderite-tetrahedrite-chalcopyrite vein that assayed over 50 ounces per ton silver. ASARCO abandoned the silver-lead development and focused on this new high grade discovery. The new discovery was called the Silver vein and has been the largest vein found at the Galena to date with estimated production of over 100 million ounces of silver at averages grades of over 20 ounces per ton. From 1953 until present, all exploration, development and production has been focused on the tetrahedrite silver-copper ores. Because ASARCO focused its efforts in 1953 on the silver-copper veins no systematic exploration program was ever conducted at the Galena for silver-lead ore until USSC took over in 2006. Total production since 1953 is over 10 million pounds of silver, 116 million pounds of copper and 22.0 million pounds of lead from 7.0 million tons of ore. Average grade of the silver-copper ore has been 22.89 ounces per ton of silver and 0.83% copper. Average grade of the silver-lead ore has been 8.18 ounces silver and 8.8% lead per ton of ore. The mine is currently producing silver-copper ore at a rate of approximately 625 tons per day. Ore grades are approximately 24.0 ounces per ton silver and 0.76% copper. The present day Galena Mine is an underground silver-copper mine and is served by two vertical shafts. The No. 3 shaft is the primary production shaft and is deep. The Galena shaft primarily provides utility access for water, electrical power and sand backfill for underground operations down to the 4,900 level. The Galena mine also has an operating 1,100 ton per day flotation mill, maintenance shop, carpenters shop office and dry facilities. The mine utilizes conventional and mechanized cut and fill mining methods with sand backfill to extract ore from the high grade silver-copper vein deposits that constitute the majority of the ore reserves. Silver and copper are recovered by a flotation mill that produces a silver rich concentrate which is sold to third- party smelters in Canada. Waste material from the milling process is deposited in a tailings pond located approximately two miles from the mine site. The tailings containment pond, which is expanded on an as needed basis, has capacity for approximately eight additional years at current production rates.  Coeur Mine  The Coeur Mine is an underground silver mine located adjacent to the Galena Mine. The Coeur Mine operated until mid-1998 when the property was placed on care and maintenance. There has been no mining activity at the Coeur mine since that time. The Coeur Mine is connected to the Galena Mine, which allows future discoveries at either mine to be developed and processed at either facility. This connection is currently being utilized to provide ventilation and secondary access to the Galena Mine. The Coeur mine produced continuously from 1969 through 1991 and again from 1996 through 1997. The total production was 39 million ounces of silver and 33 million pounds of copper from 2.4 million tons of ore. Average ore grades were 16.0 ounces per ton silver and 0.68% copper. This mine is serviced by an operational three compartment shaft with a double drum hoist that goes to below the surface. The Coeur mine also has a 600 ton per day flotation mill, maintenance shop, office and dry facility. The Coeur Mill was put back into production in October, 2007 to process lead-silver ores from the Galena Mine. The concentrates produced are shipped to Trail, British Columbia and processed by Teck-Cominco.  Caladay property  The Caladay property adjoins the Galena Mine. Prior to its acquisition by Coeur in 1991, approximately $32.5 million was expended on the property to construct surface facilities, a . deep shaft and associated underground workings to explore the property. Similar geologic conditions which exist at the Galena mine extend into Caladay below the level of the current workings. The facilities are used to benefit the Galena Mine operations by providing additional ventilation.  Mineralization  Ore deposits of the Coeur d’Alene Mining District and USSC are hosted by slightly metamorphosed Precambrian sedimentary rocks of the Belt Supergroup. Belt strata are composed primarily of fine-grained quartz and original clay (now metamorphosed to fine-grained white mica, or sericite). Although the composition of these metasediments varies widely, three major rock types are generally recognized. These rock type definitions were first applied in the district to the Revett Formation (White and Wilson, 1982) but have since been used in describing other Belt formations as well. The rock types are; vitreous quartzite, sericitic quartzite, and siltite-argillite. The ore bodies at USSC's property occur as steeply dipping fissure filling veins. The veins cut through the rocks of the Revett Formation and are found along major fracture systems and major faults. The veins generally strike east west and northeast southwest and range in thickness from a few inches to over fifteen feet. Two different ore bearing sulfide assemblages are found at the Galena, a silver- copper ore and a silver-lead ore. Grades of the silver-copper veins range from a few ounces of silver to over a thousand ounces of silver per ton and since 1953 have averaged over 22 ounces per ton. Copper grades range from tenths of a percent to over two percent and since 1953 have averaged 0.83 percent per ton. Grades of the silver-lead ores average approximately 13 ounces of silver and 16% lead per ton. The cross-section shows the Revett Formation in the core of the Big Creek anticline and the position of the productive veins discovered to date on the north limb of the anticline. The beds dip steeply to the north and the faults dip steeply to the south. On a local scale the Revett Formation consists of interbeds of hard (brittle) and soft (ductile) units; the interbed can be from inches thick to over thick.  Exploration targeting  Historic exploration at the Galena and Coeur mines was carried out by following the “trend” of the veins with drifting and diamond drilling. This method was successful but it is believed that it did not allow for recognition of the larger picture of the geologic interplay of faults, veins, and stratigraphy. One obvious effect of the trend based exploration was that the underground workings at the Galena mine were developed in NW-SE direction from the central shafts. The directional development has caused large prospective areas of the Galena and Coeur mines to remain unexplored. One such area is the hanging wall of the Polaris fault. The single largest and most productive vein in the Galena and Coeur mines is the Galena’s silver vein which has produced over 25 million ounces of silver and is located in the hanging wall of the Polaris fault. The trend-based exploration caused the workings to be developed in northwesterly trend because of numerous secondary ore vein bearing veins in the footwall of the silver vein. This development direction caused the workings to cross into the footwall of the Polaris leaving the entire hanging wall of the Polaris fault virtually unexplored for about from the eastern side of the Galena to the boundary with the Sunshine Mine. Structural control on vein mineralization has long been recognized in the Coeur d’Alene District. However, using these observations in developing predictive exploration models has proven difficult. With the advent of 3-D modeling software the integration of structure, stratigraphy and geochemistry into a three-dimensional model for use in exploration has been facilitated and is being carried out at Coeur Silver Valley. The basis of the current structural work at the Galena is that the emplacement of the vein arrays is structurally controlled. There are secondary controls imposed by stratigraphy and geochemistry but structure is considered the most dominant because the movement of fluid required for vein and mineral precipitation requires the presence of active structures. A geometric model of the Coeur-Galena was constructed in Datamine Studio software, which has allowed for examination of the faults and veins and their relationships to one another.  Merger with RX Gold & Silver  On June 7, 2012, U.S.Silver Corporation and RX Gold & Silver announced the signing of a definitive agreement to merge the two companies and form U.S. Silver & Gold. The highlights of the agreement included * U.S. Silver shareholders to receive 0.670 U.S. Silver & Gold shares per U.S. Silver share, resulting in their effective ownership of approximately 70% of the combined company * RX Gold shareholders to receive 0.109 U.S. Silver & Gold shares per RX Gold share, resulting in their effective ownership of approximately 30% of the combined company * Two 100% owned U.S. based precious metal operations that deliver immediate cash and one silver re-development asset ** Combined production base of 2.7 million ounces of silver and 26,5001 ounces of gold ** Opportunities for significant resource growth, brownfield development and operational and head office synergies ** Meaningful organic exploration potential at Drumlummon and Silver Valley area ** Geographic concentration of assets that allows for near term focus on improving mine planning and execution of cost reduction strategies * Proven board of directors and management team with significant executive experience in senior precious metals companies and the capability to deliver results in tough market conditions * Improved liquidity and capital markets profile, US$25 million in cash and capital markets relationships that position the larger, combined company for further growth through opportunistic and accretive acquisitions * Unanimous recommendations from the boards of both companies that shareholders vote for the transaction. The board and senior management of each company have agreed to vote in favour of the transaction. In addition, Sprott Asset Management LP (\\"Sprott\\") has signed a lock-up agreement supporting the transaction. Sprott is the largest shareholder of both companies and currently holds approximately 14% of U.S. Silver shares and 8% of RX Gold shares * A key objective of the combined company will be to exceed 5.0 million ounces of silver production at significantly lower cash costs by 2014. On July 25, 2012, Hecla Mining Company announced its intention to make an all-cash offer to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of U.S. Silver for C$1.80 per share and all of the outstanding common share purchase warrants of U.S. Silver for C$0.205 per warrant. On July 30, 2012, U.S. Silver’s Board of Directors unanimously recommended that U.S. Silver shareholders reject the unsolicited cash offer from Hecla Mining and recommended that U.S. Silver instead vote their U.S. Silver shares in favour of the proposed combination transaction with RX Gold & Silver Inc. On August 7, 2012, during the special meeting of shareholders, U.S. Silver shareholders approved the proposed transaction with RX Gold.

The musical score was by Walter Goehr and Bronislau Kaper, and the cinematography by Freddie Young. The picture, Gable's last for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, was filmed on location in the Netherlands and England, and was based on the story of turncoat Dutch resistance leader Christiaan Lindemans, also known as \\"King Kong\\". The supporting cast features O. E. Hasse, Wilfrid Hyde-White, Ian Carmichael, Niall MacGinnis, and Theodore Bikel. Betrayed was the fourth and final movie in which Gable played opposite Turner, and their third pairing set during World War II. (They played comrades, not simply lovers, in all three war films.) Diana Coupland provided Turner's singing voice in the song \\"Johnny Come Home\\". Betrayed was spoofed in the film Top Secret! (1984). Plot Betrayed is an espionage thriller set in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands during World War II, and revolves mostly around the Dutch resistance movement. Colonel Pieter Deventer (Clark Gable) is an intelligence agent of the exiled Dutch government, working to liberate his homeland from Nazi occupiers. He divides his time between secret missions in the Netherlands and trips to England to consult his superiors and a British general. Deventer is ordered to keep an eye on singer Fran Seelers (Lana Turner), who's suspected of collaborating with the Germans. Both Deventer and Seelers join the shadowy Dutch underground, making contact with a flamboyant resistance leader known as \\"The Scarf\\" (Victor Mature). As \\"Carla Van Oven\\", Seelers is assigned is to use her feminine charms to gain the confidence of Nazi officers and gather information. In one scene, resistance fighters burst into a lavish dinner party where Seelers is singing, and shoot Nazi officers. Within the next few weeks, however, a considerable number of underground operatives are captured and shot while carrying out ambushes and sabotage missions. It begins to look as though Deventer's suspicions about Seelers were correct, which weighs on his heart, because the two have fallen in love. Ultimately, as Allied troops and the local resistance begin to turn the tide against the Nazis, \\"The Scarf\\" is revealed to be the real collaborator, and Deventer executes him. Seelers, who had loyally served the underground and almost been killed, turns up safe with British troops, and the two lovers are reunited.

Clark Gable walks past a crowd (1953) The film was at one stage known as The True and the Brave, with Kirk Douglas mentioned as a possible star. Richard Widmark was at one stage a forerunner for the part played by Victor Mature. Ava Gardner was to play the female lead, but was eventually replaced by Lana Turner. Filming took place in late 1953 and early 1954, on location in Holland and England. It was the final film Gable made for MGM under his contract, which ended in March 1954. Release Box office According to MGM records, the film earned $1,966,000 in the US and Canada, and $2,211,000 overseas, resulting in a profit of $821,000. Critical reception In a 1954 review in The New York Times, critic Bosley Crowther wrote: \\"By the time this picture gets around to figuring out whether the betrayer is Miss Turner or Mr. Mature, it has taken the audience through such a lengthy and tedious amount of detail that it has not only frayed all possible tension, but it has aggravated patience as well. Miss Turner and Mr. Gable have had many long-winded talks; Mr. Mature has thumped his chest like Tarzan and bellowed his boasts a score of times. An excess of espionage maneuvering has been laid out on the screen. The beauties of the countryside of the Netherlands have been looked at until they pall.\\" Home media Betrayed was released on DVD and digital download on March 23, 2009, as part of the Warner Archive.http://www.wbshop.com/Betrayed-+EST- MOD/1000088122,default,pd.html References External links  1954 films 1954 romantic drama films 1950s spy drama films 1950s war drama films American films American romantic drama films American spy drama films Films about World War II resistance movements Films directed by Gottfried Reinhardt Films set in the Netherlands Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer films American war drama films World War II spy films 1954 drama films ","title":"Betrayed (1954 film)"},{"id":"6461833","text":"Illinois Route 169 is an east-west state road in far southern Illinois.

The highlight of that sale was Albrecht Dürer's Adam and Eve, which sold for an impressive $10,000.  Watch collector  An ardent watch collector, Graves was a patron of Patek Philippe, competing with James Ward Packard, the automobile manufacturer, for ownership of the most complicated watch in the world.Perman, Stacy, A Grand Complication: The Race to Build the World's Most Legendary Watch, Atria Books (Simon & Schuster), February 2013. In 1927 Packard commissioned a complicated watch but, not to be outdone, Graves surpassed his rival in 1933 to become the owner of the most complicated watch ever made.  Supercomplication watch  It was called Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication. Designed and built by Patek Philippe, it was an ultra-complicated (24 functions) pocket watch. Graves spent 60,000 Swiss francs (USD $15,000), nearly five times the price paid by Packard. It took three years to design, another five to manufacture, and was sold to Graves on January 19, 1933. The most advanced techniques in horological engineering produced a truly one-of-a-kind timepiece; only one watch was ever built. Complications included a perpetual calendar with phases and age of the moon, indication of sunrise and sunset, and a celestial chart depicting the stars in the nighttime sky over New York City.- Graves died in 1953. His heirs sold the watch in 1968 to The Time Museum in Rockford, Illinois, which closed in March 1999. (From January 2001 through February 2004 the Time Museum collection was displayed at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry, then sold.)

A tetrapeptide is a peptide, classified as an oligopeptide, since it only consists of four amino acids joined by peptide bonds. Many tetrapeptides are pharmacologically active, often showing affinity and specificity for a variety of receptors in protein- protein signaling. Present in nature are both linear and cyclic tetrapeptides (CTPs), the latter of which mimics protein reverse turns which are often present on the surface of proteins and druggable targets. Tetrapeptides may be cyclized by a fourth peptide bond or other covalent bonds. Examples of tetrapeptides are: * Tuftsin (L-threonyl-L-lysyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine) is a peptide related primarily to the immune system function. * Rigin (glycyl-L- glutaminyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine) is a tetrapeptide with functions similar to those of tuftsin. * Postin (Lys-Pro-Pro-Arg) is the N-terminal tetrapeptide of cystatin C and an antagonist of tuftsin. * Endomorphin-1 (H-Tyr-Pro-Trp-Phe- NH2) and endomorphin-2 (H-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Phe-NH2) are peptide amides with the highest known affinity and specificity for the μ opioid receptor. * Morphiceptin (H-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-NH2) is a casomorphin peptide isolated from β-casein. * Gluten exorphines A4 (H-Gly-Tyr-Tyr-Pro-OH) and B4 (H-Tyr-Gly-Gly- Trp-OH) are peptides isolated from gluten. * Tyrosine-MIF-1 (H-Tyr-Pro-Leu- Gly-NH2) is an endogenous opioid modulator. * Tetragastrin (N-((phenylmethoxy)carbonyl)-L-tryptophyl-L-methionyl-L-aspartyl-L- phenylalaninamide) is the C-terminal tetrapeptide of gastrin. It is the smallest peptide fragment of gastrin which has the same physiological and pharmacological activity as gastrin. * Kentsin (H-Thr-Pro-Arg-Lys-OH) is a contraceptive peptide first isolated from female hamsters. * Achatin-I (glycyl-phenylalanyl-alanyl-aspartic acid) is a neuroexcitatory tetrapeptide from giant African snail (Achatina fulica). * Tentoxin (cyclo(N-methyl-L- alanyl-L-leucyl-N-methyl-trans-dehydrophenyl-alanyl-glycyl)) is a natural cyclic tetrapeptide produced by phytopathogenic fungi from genus Alternaria. * Rapastinel (H-Thr-Pro-Pro-Thr-NH2) is a partial agonist of the NMDA receptor. *HC-toxin, cyclo(D-Pro-L-Ala-D-Ala-L-Aeo), where Aeo is 2-amino-8-oxo-9,10-epoxy decanoic acid, is a virulence factor for the fungus Cochliobolus carbonum on its host, maize. * Elamipretide, (D-Arg-dimethylTyr- Lys-Phe-NH2) a drug candidate that targets mitochondria.

Laurence renewed his \\"hand\\" (also known as \\"Bai'at\\") in the Halveti-Jerrahi Order with Grand Sheikh Sayyid Safer Dal Efendi in 1996. Galian was bestowed the additional name \\"Muzaffer\\" by Haydar Baba of the Nur Ashki Jerrahi Sufi Order, in honor of the memory of Sheikh Muzafferuddin \\"Ashki\\" Ozak. On September 18, 2003, he reestablished his connection with Hazreti Pir Muhammad Nureddin Jerrahi (the founder of the Jerrahi Order - born in Istanbul in 1678 C.E.) by renewing his hand with Shaykha Fariha al-Jerrahi, the lineage bearer in the Americas (with the help of Shaykha Amina and the khalifas and circle leaders of the Order). From 2005 - 2009 Laurence Galian served as the \\"Friend\\" (leader) of the Nur Ashki Jerrahi St. Louis Circle. In December 2009 he and his wife moved to Mexico City, Mexico.

First invented in Nova Scotia, they later spread to the St. John Valley and Maine. Much like grits, or potatoes, the ploye was originally a simple carbohydrate filler food for the local population. It was very cheap, easy to make, and with local toppings, such as maple syrup or cretons, could vary in taste. This staple is often eaten with baked beans. Over time however, it simply became a traditional dish. The recipe varies from family to family and is handed down through the generations. The batter itself is very thin and runny so as to ensure it does not get too thick while cooking. The ploye resembles a crêpe in thickness when cooking. In Madawaska, Maine, the ployes have a yellow color due to the type of buckwheat used in the mixture. Recipes sometimes include a little vinegar to keep the cakes from turning red. A ploye, contrary to a pancake, is only cooked on one side (but some turn it over after for a few seconds). Once cooked, it is buttered, and covered in maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses or cretons. It is then rolled or folded up and eaten. It is also served with the local traditional chicken stew called fricot, which more closely resembles chicken soup with homemade flour dumplings (also called sliders). Ployes are often served at local events and fairs, such as the Ployes Festival and Foire Brayonne. Ployes are popular with vegans because they are made without milk or eggs. In 2016, food columnist Avery Yale Kamila wrote in the Portland Press Herald: \\"Made from buckwheat flour, wheat flour, salt, and a leavening agent, ployes are a griddle cake associated with the French Acadian communities of eastern Canada and northern Maine. Though traditionally eaten with chicken stew, hot dogs, and other meat- based meals, ployes have been embraced by Maine’s vegan community.\\" See also * Kaletez * List of buckwheat dishes * Memil-buchimgae References Canadian cuisine Pancakes Buckwheat dishes Vegan cuisine ","title":"Ploye"},{"id":"6462110","title":"Women of the Otherworld"},{"id":"6462113","text":"Florida's 15th congressional district is an electoral district for the U.S. Congress and was reassigned in 2012, effective January 2013, to the northern parts of Hillsborough and Polk counties as well as the southernmost parts of Lake.

Rocks of the Midford Sands of the Bridport Formation emerge at the base of the limestone where it meets the floodplain. The flora The grasses and herb which grow in the farm's hay meadows are indicative of the long period that the land has been managed non intensively. The untreated sward has a wide variety and abundance of typical herbs of such meadows such as black knapweed (Centaurea nigra), yellow rattle (Rhinanthus minor) and bird's-foot-trefoil (Lotus corniculatus). The high lime content of the soil in the hay meadows is demonstrated by presence of plants such as the frequent salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor), upright brome (Bromus erectus), hoary plantain (Plantago media) and rough hawkbit (Leontodon hispidus). Where there are wet field edges species which favour damper conditions are found including common meadow-rue (Thalictrum flavum), a localised species in North Wiltshire. Where the meadows are borders by ditches these support a rich wetland vegetation while the transition between the meadows and the nearby ancient woodland supports a rich flora which is now rare in lowland Britain. Archaeology Roman artefacts have been found near the farm.

It was designed by the now-defunct Custom Coasters International (CCI). The ride opened as a part of the four-coaster expansion Six Flags brought to Geauga Lake between 1999 and 2000. It was a wooden hybrid, which means it had steel supports but had wood track. When it originally opened, the ride was moderately smooth, but by 2001 it deteriorated and was re-tracked during the off-season. This was the second CCI coaster to feature a \\"trick track\\" element (the first was Shivering Timbers at Michigan's Adventure) where the track banks from one side to another while staying otherwise on a straight path. Rocky Mountain Construction, an Idaho-based manufacturing firm, handled the construction of the ride. The ride had been retracked by Martin & Vleminckx. Currently, the Villain's trains are at Kings Island, another Cedar Fair park in Mason, OH.http://newsplusnotes.blogspot.com/2011/04/rejected- amusements-villain-at-six.html It is unknown what they will be used for. On June 17, 2008, Villain was sold for scrap to Cleveland Scrap for $2,500. The ride has since been demolished. Demolition In September 2007, Geauga Lake shut down and only the water park, Wildwater Kingdom, remained open until September 2016, following the same fate of Geauga Lake. Most of its rides have been moved to other amusement parks, but only the wooden coasters and the steel coaster Double Loop have not been saved. Incidents In July 2000 when the amusement park was Six Flags Ohio, forty-four-year-old Terri Wang of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was injured while riding Villain. While on the ride Wang was struck with several objects that were believed to be rocks or a cell phone. The impact of the objects caused her to endure a fractured skull and broken nose. Park officials had previously been warned about patrons who were throwing rocks at rides. With that, rocks were found on the ground below the roller coaster as well as on the catwalk and track. However, a park attorney theorized that Wang was struck with a cell phone. Wang sued Six Flags because of the injuries that she sustained. The trial was held at Portage County Common Pleas Court and the jury determined Six Flags was guilty of negligence. Wang was awarded $1.1 million for medical expenses and $2.5 million in punitive damages because of the trial’s verdict.

Rather than moving homeless individuals through different \\"levels\\" of housing, whereby each level moves them closer to \\"independent housing\\" (for example: from the streets to a public shelter, and from a public shelter to a transitional housing program, and from there to their own apartment in the community), Housing First moves the homeless individual or household immediately from the streets or homeless shelters into their own accommodation. Housing First approaches are based on the concept that a homeless individual or household's first and primary need is to obtain stable housing, and that other issues that may affect the household can and should be addressed once housing is obtained. In contrast, many other programs operate from a model of \\"housing readiness\\" — that is, that an individual or household must address other issues that may have led to the episode of homelessness prior to entering housing. General principles Housing First is an approach that offers permanent, affordable housing as quickly as possible for individuals and families experiencing homelessness, and then provides the supportive services and connections to the community-based supports people need to keep their housing and avoid returning to homelessness. The principles behind this approach are: # Move people into housing directly from streets and shelters without preconditions of treatment acceptance or compliance; # The provider is obligated to bring robust support services to the housing. These services are predicated on assertive engagement, not coercion; # Continued tenancy is not dependent on participation in services; # Units targeted to most disabled and vulnerable homeless members of the community; # Embraces harm-reduction approach to addictions rather than mandating abstinence. At the same time, the provider must be prepared to support resident commitment to recovery; # Residents must have leases and tenant protections under the law; # Can be implemented as either a project-based or scattered site model.  History and evolution  In Los Angeles, California, in 1988, the \\"Housing First\\" Program for families was launched at Beyond Shelter by Tanya Tull in response to a sharp increase in the number of homeless families with children. The \\"housing first\\" approach for families includes in-depth screening and assessment for child safety. Families should not be relocated to rental housing if there are indicators that a child might be in danger. In \\"housing first\\" for families, services are available before, during, and after relocation to rental housing - but engagement is not a requirement for participation. Unfortunately the \\"housing first\\" philosophy was often misinterpreted in later years and, today, many government programs promote faulty application of \\"housing first.\\" For households with children, appropriate services and monitoring may be delivered through home visits, outpatient treatment, or linking to appropriate services in the community at- large. In 1992 Dr. Sam Tsemberis, a faculty member of the Department of Psychiatry of the New York University School of Medicine, founded Pathways to Housing in New York City. Housing First for the chronically homeless is premised on the notion that housing is a basic human right, and so should not be denied to anyone, even if they are abusing alcohol or other substances. The Housing First model, thus, is philosophically in contrast to models that require the homeless to abjure substance-abuse and seek treatment in exchange for housing. Housing First, when supported by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, does not only provide housing. The model, used by nonprofit agencies throughout America, also provides wraparound case management services to the tenants. This case management provides stability for homeless individuals, which increases their success. It allows for accountability and promotes self-sufficiency. The housing provided through government supported Housing First programs is permanent and \\"affordable,\\" meaning that tenants pay 30% of their income towards rent. Housing First, as pioneered by Pathways to Housing, targets individuals with disabilities. This housing is supported through two HUD programs. They are the Supportive Housing Program and the Shelter Plus Care Program. Pathways' Housing First model has been recognized by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration as an Evidence-based practice. The Housing First Model is executed through either a scattered-site or project-based implementation. A scattered-site Housing First program is a model in which residents are offered the opportunity of being housed in individual housing units throughout a community. This model integrates participants in a community as opposed to assembling multiple or all participants in one project or location. In a project-based Housing First implementation, residents are offered units within a single housing project or site. This model congregates multiple or all participants in one locality. In both the scattered-site and project-based Housing First programs, residents are given access to a wide variety of supportive health and rehabilitation services which they have the option, although not mandatory, to participate in and receive treatment. Housing First is currently endorsed by the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) as a \\"best practice\\" for governments and service-agencies to use in their fight to end chronic homelessness in America. Housing First programs currently operate throughout the United States in cities such as New Orleans, Louisiana;\\"Housing First model of addressing homelessness is discussed,\\" The Times-Picayune, Mar. 21, 2012 Plattsburgh, New York; San Diego, California;https://www.sdhc.org/homelessness-solutions/housing-first-san- diego/; Anchorage, Alaska; Salisbury, Maryland; Minneapolis, Minnesota; New York City; District of Columbia; Denver, Colorado; San Francisco, California; Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Portland, Maine; Quincy, Massachusetts; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Salt Lake City, Utah;\\"Homeless gain homes at manor,\\" Deseret News, Feb. 29, 2008 Seattle, Washington; Los Angeles; Austin, Texas;http://www.austintexas.gov/department/permanent-supportive-housing- initiative and Cleveland, OhioCleveland, Ohio Evidence and outcome In Massachusetts, the Home & Healthy for Good program reported some significant outcomes that were favorable especially in the area of cost savings.\\"MHSA Submits Updated Home & Healthy for Good Report to Legislature: Statewide Housing First initiative reports dramatic cost savings to Commonwealth\\" — December 2007 The Denver Housing First Collaborative, operated by the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, provides housing through a Housing First approach to more than 200 chronically homeless individuals. A 2006 cost study documented a significant reduction in the use and cost of emergency services by program participants as well as increased health status. Emergency room visits and costs were reduced by an average of 34.3 percent. Hospital inpatient costs were reduced by 66 percent. Detox visits were reduced by 82 percent. Incarceration days and costs were reduced by 76 percent. 77 percent of those entering the program continued to be housed in the program after two years. Researchers in Seattle, Washington, partnering with the Downtown Emergency Service Center, found that providing housing and support services for homeless alcoholics costs taxpayers less than leaving them on the street, where taxpayer money goes towards police and emergency health care. Results of the study funded by the Substance Abuse Policy Research Program (SAPRP) of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association April, 2009. This first US controlled assessment of the effectiveness of Housing First specifically targeting chronically homeless alcoholics showed that the program saved taxpayers more than $4 million over the first year of operation. During the first six months, even after considering the cost of administering the housing, 95 residents in a Housing First program in downtown Seattle, the study reported an average cost-savings of 53 percent—nearly US $2,500 per month per person in health and social services, compared to the per month costs of a wait-list control group of 39 homeless people. Further, stable housing also results in reduced drinking among homeless alcoholics. In Utah, there has been \\"a 72 percent decrease overall since enacting the plan in 2005\\" according to the Utah Division of Housing and Community Development.Utah Housing and Community Development Comprehensive Report on Homelessness 2014 In August 2007, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development reported that the number of chronically homeless individuals living on the streets or in shelters dropped by an unprecedented 30 percent, from 175,914 people in 2005 to 123,833 in 2007. This was credited in part to the \\"housing first\\" approach; Congress in 1999 directed that HUD spend 30% of its funding on the method.\\"U.S. Reports Drop in Homeless Population\\", New York Times, July 20, 2008. In September 2010, it was reported that the Housing First Initiative had significantly reduced the chronic homeless single person population in Boston, Massachusetts, although homeless families were still increasing in number. Some shelters were reducing the number of beds due to lowered numbers of homeless, and some emergency shelter facilities were closing, especially the emergency Boston Night Center.Brady- Myerov, Monica, \\"Homelessness On The Decline In Boston\\", WBUR Radio, Boston, September 29, 2010 By 2015, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh had announced a 3-year plan to end chronic homelessness, focusing on coordinating efforts among public agencies and nonprofit organizations providing services to homeless men and women. In 2013, the estimated national public cost of chronic homelessness was between $3.7 and $4.7 billion according to the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH). Through Housing First programs, chronically homeless individuals are using fewer hospital resources, spending less time in costly incarceration and requiring fewer emergency room visits. For example, a review of the impact of permanent supportive housing and case management on the health of the chronically homeless found evidence that these services have a positive impact on health outcomes such as self-reported mental health status and substance use, a large impact on health care utilization, and a reduction in Medicaid health care costs. Studies in New York City and in Utah have shown that every homeless person housed in programs such as Housing First saves taxpayers $10,000 and $8,000 a year, respectively. A research study at University of Northern Carolina also reported that a housing project for the chronically homeless called Moore Place had saved the county $2.4 million. The implementation of Housing First philosophy when working with homeless families and young adults has been shown to increase clients' enrollment in public assistance benefits, decrease involvement in the child welfare system, and have very few returning to homelessness. When comparing the effects of Housing First on older and younger homeless adults, older homeless adults have shown significantly higher rates of improvement in areas like mental component summary scores, condition specific quality of life, mental health symptom severity, and percentage of days stably housed. When comparing the effects of Housing First on homeless adults with lower or borderline intellectual functioning to homeless adults with normal intellectual functioning it has been shown that there is no significant difference. Post-2007 U.S. policy and legislation The United States Congress appropriated $25 million in the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Grants for 2008 to show the effectiveness of Rapid Re-Housing programs in reducing family homelessness.National Alliance to End Homelessness, \\"Rapid Re-Housing\\" , July 8, 2008.United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, \\"Homeless Assistance Programs\\" National Alliance to End Homelessness, \\"HUD and McKinney-Vento Appropriations\\" , FY 2010 In February 2009, President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, part of which addressed homelessness prevention, allocating $1.5 billion for a Homeless Prevention Fund. The funding for it was called the \\"Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program\\" (HPRP), and was distributed using the formula for the Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG) program.United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, \\"Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program\\" On May 20, 2009, President Obama signed the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act into Public Law (Public Law 111-22 or \\"PL 111-22\\"), reauthorizing HUD's Homeless Assistance programs. It was part of the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009. The HEARTH act allows for the prevention of homelessness, rapid re-housing, consolidation of housing programs, and new homeless categories. In the eighteen months after the bill's signing, HUD must make regulations implementing this new McKinney program. In late 2009, some homeless advocacy organizations, such as the National Coalition for the Homeless, reported and published perceived problems with the HEARTH Act of 2009 as a HUD McKinney-Vento Reauthorization bill, especially with regard to privacy, definitional ineligibility, community roles, and restrictions on eligibile activities.National Coalition for the Homeless, \\"NCH Public Policy Recommendations: HUD McKinney-Vento Reauthorization\\", Washington, D.C., September 14, 2009 On June 22, 2010, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness presented Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness to the Obama Administration and Congress. This is the nation's first comprehensive strategy as mandated by the HEARTH Act and includes Housing First as a best practice for reaching the goal of ending chronic homelessness by 2015. On June 11, 2014, the 100,000 Homes Campaign in the United States, launched in 2010 to \\"help communities around the country place 100,000 chronically homeless people into permanent supportive housing\\", announced that it reached its four-year goal of housing 100,000 chronically homeless people nearly two months before its July 29 deadline. New York Times journalist David Bornstein summarized key elements of the 100,000 Homes Campaign that campaign leaders attribute to its success. This included learning individual homeless people's \\"name and need\\" by mobilizing volunteers to go very early in the morning to check on them, establishing a \\"vulnerability index\\" so they could prioritize certain homeless people and \\"bring housing advocates and agency representatives together to streamline the placement processes, and share ideas about how to cut through red tape.\\" Application to family homelessness The Housing First methodology was initially developed in 1988 in Los Angeles, California, to address an increase in family homelessness. The basic methodology helps homeless families to relocate from shelters and transitional housing directly into permanent rental housing in the community at-large as quickly as possible, with home-based case management support for a traditional period of time. In other words, the services traditionally being provided in transitional housing were instead provided to families after they had been assisted in relocating to permanent housing at rents they could afford. This was a major innovation in the field at the time. The basic premise was that families were more responsive to interventions and support from a stable permanent housing base than while still homeless. In the 2009 HEARTH Act, the Housing First approach to ending homelessness was codified into law. Housing First programs for families differ dramatically from Housing First for the chronically homeless, as children are involved.\\"About the 'Housing First' Program for Homeless Families\\", Beyond Shelter agency, Los Angeles, California. Beyond Shelter's leadership promoted this new approach across the country for the next 20 years, working collaboratively with the National Alliance to End Homelessness.  Outside the United States  Australia In South Australia, the State Government of Premier Mike Rann (2002 to 2011) committed substantial funding to a series of initiatives designed to combat homelessness. Advised by Social Inclusion Commissioner David Cappo and the founder of New York's Common Ground program, Rosanne Haggerty, the Rann Government established Common Ground Adelaide, building high quality inner city apartments (combined with intensive support) for \\"rough sleeping\\" homeless people. The government also funded the Street to Home program and a hospital liaison service designed to assist homeless people who are admitted to the emergency departments of Adelaide's major public hospitals. Rather than being released back into homelessness, patients identified as rough sleepers are found accommodation backed by professional support. Common Ground and Street to Home now operate across Australia in other states. The \\"Street to Home\\" and \\"Common Ground\\" projects have been shown to produce similar results to the US Housing First model in terms of strong housing outcomes and reductions in intensity and frequency of service use relative to pre- intervention levels. Canada In its Economic Action Plan 2013, the Federal Government of Canada proposed $119 million annually from March 2014 until March 2019—with $600 million in new funding—to renew its Homelessness Partnering Strategy (HPS). In dealing with homelessness in Canada, the focus is on the Housing First model. Thus, private or public organizations across Canada are eligible to receive HPS subsidies to implement Housing First programs. In 2008, the Federal Government of Canada funded a five-year demonstration program, the At Home/Chez Soi project, aimed at providing evidence about what services and systems best help people experiencing serious mental illness and homelessness. Launched in November 2009 and ending in March 2013, the At Home/Chez Soi project was actively addressing the housing need by offering Housing First programs to people with mental illness who were experiencing homelessness in five cities: Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montréal and Moncton. In total, At Home/Chez Soi has provided more than 1,000 Canadians with housing.Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC). 2014. Housing and Homelessness: What is the issue? Calgary, Alberta. Housing First has grown in popularity in Canada and used in many Canadian ten-year plans to end homelessness, such as those in Edmonton and Calgary, Alberta. Housing First: A Canadian Perspective (TM) is spearheaded by Pathways to Housing Calgary and director Sue Fortune. Canadian adaptations to Housing First have demonstrated positive outcomes as documented on the website: www.thealex.ca (Housing Programs; Pathways to Housing). Canadian implementations of Housing First must be tailored to Canadian homelessness, resources, politics and philosophy. In Calgary, Alberta, the Alex Pathways to Housing Calgary which opened in 2007, has 150 individuals in scatter site homes in 2013. Clients pay 30 percent of their income towards their rent: 85 percent of Pathways to Housing clients receive Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped (AISH) benefits and 15 percent receive Alberta Works. The Alex Pathways to Housing uses a Housing First model, but it also uses Assertive Community Treatment (ACT), an integrated approach to healthcare where clients access a team of \\"nurses, mental health specialists, justice specialists and substance abuse specialists.\\" Director Sue Fortune is committed to the 10 Year Plan To End Homelessless in the Calgary Region. Fortune reported that the Housing First approach resulted in a 66 percent decline in days hospitalized (from one year prior to intake compared to one year in the program), a 38 percent decline in times in emergency room, a 41 percent decline in EMS events, a 79 percent decline in days in jail and a 30 percent decline in police interactions. Sue Fortune, Director of Alex Pathways to Housing in Calgary in her 2013 presentation entitled \\"Canadian Adaptations using Housing First: A Canadian Perspective\\" argued that less than 1% of existing clients return to shelters or rough sleeping; clients spend 76% fewer days in jail; clients have 35% decline in police interactions. Pathways to Housing Canada describes the Housing First as a \\"client-driven strategy that provides immediate access to an apartment without requiring initial participation in psychiatric treatment or treatment for sobriety.\\" Following the development of several Housing First programs through the Home/Chez Soi research project, an initiative to provide Housing First training and technical assistance was created and has been shown to be useful in developing high fidelity programs.  Denmark  In Denmark, Housing First is embedded in the national Homeless Strategy as the overall strategy. However, it has been shown that this intervention strategy is serving only a small number of people recorded to be homeless which is most likely due to barriers like shortage of affordable housing. Finland In 2007 the centre-right government of Matti Vanhanen began a special program of four wise men to eliminate homelessness in Finland by 2015.Finnish government's programme to reduce long-term homelessness 2008–2011 The programme to reduce long-term homelessness targets just some homeless people. Assessed on the basis of social, health and financial circumstances, this is the hard core of homelessness. The programme to reduce long-term homelessness focuses on the 10 biggest urban growth centres, where most of the homeless are to be found. The main priority, however, is the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, and especially Helsinki itself, where long-term homelessness is concentrated. The programme is structured around the housing first principle. Solutions to social and health problems cannot be a condition for organising accommodation: on the contrary, accommodation is a requirement which also allows other problems of people who have been homeless to be solved. Having somewhere to live makes it possible to strengthen life management skills and is conducive to purposeful activity. Because of all the reasons there are for long-term homelessness, if it is to be cut there need to be simultaneous measures at different levels, i.e. universal housing and social policy measures, the prevention of homelessness and targeted action to reduce long-term homelessness. The programme’s objectives are: * To halve long-term homelessness by 2011 * To eliminate homelessness entirely by 2015 * More effective measures to prevent homelessness France The French government launched a Housing First-like program in France in 2010 in 4 major cities - Toulouse, Marseille, Lille and Paris - called \\"Un chez-Soi d'abord\\". It follows the same principles as the Canadian and US programs: it is focused on homeless people with mental illness or addicted to drugs or alcohol. The plan is on a three-year basis for each individual, living in accommodation provided by an NGO.26 Janv 2010 Report Clients are given any needed help with social issues and medical care.

They provide rental management and social support for tenants.Intermediation Locative Those NGOs are linked with scientists investigating the results of the experiment and serve as a relay for information and status reports on the targeted public. The lead team of \\"Un chez-soi d'abord\\" is expecting results to be published around 2017.Programme expérimental« Un chez-soi d’abord » Japan Though homeless support groups like non-profit organization Moyai, Bigissue, Médecins du Monde Japan have requested Housing First, Japanese government does not have a Housing First program yet. Traditionally, the government offers public housing (so-called Koei-jutaku) for low-income people by public housing law, run by local government. Rent fees are adjusted according to household income. Because applicants must be selected by lottery, low-income people are not guaranteed to be chosen to live in the housing, although they have an advantage. There are a couple of Housing First-like programs. Non-profit organization Littleones renovates discarded or empty homes and they rent the rooms to single mothers with financial and occupational support. The Tsukuroi Tokyo fund advocates Housing First, and they built a shelter specifically for homeless people.  United Kingdom  The U.K. government announced plans for a Housing First pilot programme in the West Midlands, Liverpool, and Manchester, along with funding of £28m. This followed publication of a report entitled Housing First by the Centre for Social Justice which cited the results from the Finnish application of Housing First.  Miscellaneous  As part of the H2020 research project \\"HOME_EU: Reversing Homelessness in Europe\\" by the European Commission, approximately 5600 surveys have been conducted between March and December 2017 in France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Poland, and Sweden in order to understand people's knowledge, attitudes, and practices about homelessness and how much support the general public has in regards to Housing First as a solution for homelessness in Europe. Criticism of Housing First One-size-fits-all Columbia University professor Ralph DaCosta Nunez, the president and chief executive officer of the Institute for Children, Poverty and Homelessness (ICPH), calls Housing First \\"one-size-fits-all\\" and claims statistics in New York City prove it is destined to fail.Rapidly Rehousing Homeless Families: New York City—a Case Study Nunez believes that Housing First is \\"all that's left after the other poverty fighting programs have been underfunded or eliminated.\\" Nunez instead advocates a three-tiered approach to addressing homelessness with Housing First as its first component.Housing First Doesn't Work: The Homeless Need Community Support - The Huffington Post Limits of evidence based policy On July 31, 2011, Prof. Victoria Stanhope, Ph.D., of New York University School of Social Work and Prof. Kerry Dunn, J.D., Ph.D., of University of New England School of Social Work, published “The curious case of Housing First; The limits of evidence-based policy” in the International Journal of Law and Psychiatry. Drs. Stanhope and Dunn gave an overview of evidence-based policy and presented “critiques based on its reliance on positivist methods and technical approach to policy making. Using these critiques as a framework, the paper discusse[d] the case of Housing First, a policy adopted by the Bush Administration in order to address the problem of chronic homelessness.” According to Drs. Stanhope and Dunn, the Housing First “is an example of research-driven policy making but also resulted in a progressive policy being promoted by a conservative administration. In discussing the case, the paper elaborates on the relationship between evidence and policy, arguing that evidence-based policy fails to integrate evidence and values into policy deliberations. The paper concludes with alternative models of policy decision-making and their implications for research.” Housing First has been criticized on its failure to address broader service outcomes, namely substance abuse (in one case, it was argued that the only reason substance abuse outcomes were no worse was that the residents were not severely addicted). These criticisms have been rebutted on the grounds that Housing First is a program to end homelessness not to reduce substance abuse, though more recent research indicates it is more effective than traditional approaches in this regard as well. This exchange highlights the way in which the selection of outcomes sets both the terms of the debate and the parameters of “what works.” Embedded in that mantra are a priori decisions about what constitutes working and for whom; in this case it was stable housing for the chronic homeless. According to Stanhope, Housing First “asserts a right to housing. Such a material right is an anathema to neoliberal ideology and challenges deeply held beliefs that have shaped US welfare from its inception: That no one has a right to a government benefit unless they have proved themselves to be deserving or worthy (e.g., \\"TANF\\"), or have earned it (e.g., social insurance).” In a rapid review and document analysis of Housing First scholarly literature in the U.S. and Canada, it has been shown that these literature are severely lacking in the implementation and explicit mention of Harm Reduction.

Birth and university  Prince Friedrich was born in Meiningen the second son of Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen and his second wife Princess Feodora of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, a descendant of Diego Velázquez. Prince Friedrich attended the University of Bonn where unusually for a royal prince he refused to accept an adjutant or maintain a horse and carriage. At university due to his royal status he was a member of the exclusive \\"Borussia\\" student dueling corps. Although the future William II, German Emperor was a prominent member, Prince Friedrich was not active in the group, rarely attending meetings, instead preferring to shun social life in favour of concentrating on his studies. He narrowly escaped serious injury at Bonn when a retort blew up near him during a chemical experiment.German Princes Who Have Fallen in the War. New York Times. 31 October 1915 Army and death After finishing his studies Prince Friedrich entered into the army. Just as he had at university while a lieutenant in Strassbourg he was not an active member of society focusing on the study of artillery. He was promoted to colonel in 1902, brigadier general in 1907 and major general in 1910 before retiring from the army in 1913. With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Prince Friedrich, despite suffering a broken arm a short while beforehand, returned to active service. Prince Friedrich met his death fighting in Tarcienne during the invasion of Belgium. His son Prince Georg travelled to meet his father's regiment to discover his father's fate. He discovered his father had been struck by shrapnel or machine gun bullets when he left a house he was using as an observation post. His body was brought to the College of the Sacred Heart of Charleroi where he was embalmed. His body was returned to Meiningen for burial. The American sculptor and Rome resident Moses Ezekiel created a bust of him. Marriage and issue Prince Friedrich married Countess Adelaide of Lippe-Biesterfeld (later Princess of Lippe), daughter of Count Ernst of Lippe- Biesterfeld, in Neudorf on 24 April 1889. The dynastic status of the marriage of Friedrich and Adelaide was questioned during the Lippe succession dispute when it was argued that if Adelaide's brother, Leopold, was excluded from the Lippe succession on the grounds that their great-grandmother, Modeste von Unruh, was not of equal birth, then the children of Friedrich and Adelaide should be excluded from the Saxe-Meiningen succession on the same grounds.Article 2 -- No Title, By The Associated Press.

Joicey was a forward who did not play league football until he was 23 years old. In professional football he made 277 appearances and scored 100 goals. Following his football league career he returned to high level non league football. Playing career Amateur in the 1960s Brian Joicey was born in the Winlaton area of Blaydon, Tyne and Wear on 19 December 1945. He played as a youth for Clara ValeClara Vale F.C. Confirms that Joicey played for Clara Vale. On leaving school he played for the Northern League clubs Ashington, Blyth Spartans and Tow Law Town. He started to make a name for himself as a footballer when playing as an amateur for North Shields in the late 1960s. He was a member of the North Shields team that won the Northern League and the FA Amateur Cup in the 1968–69 season, Joicey scored one of the goals which beat Sutton United 2–1 at Wembley Stadium to win the Amateur Cup that season and made a major contribution, scoring 44 goals as the team finished top of the Northern League. Coventry City Joicey's success with North Shields alerted some professional league clubs and he surprisingly signed for First Division Coventry City in preference to Newcastle United for the start of the 1969–70 season, he made 39 league appearances and scored nine goals in his two full seasons with Coventry as they finished sixth in Division One in his first season with the club and qualified for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Joicey scored a goal in the Fairs Cup victory over Trakia Plovdiv at Highfield Road in October 1970. During his time with Coventry Joicey was never an automatic selection for the first team and played a large amount of reserve team football as Neil Martin was preferred as first choice centre forward.www.justcatnaps.com. Gives general information. Sheffield Wednesday Joicey started the 1971–72 season with Coventry but before the end of August he had joined Second Division Sheffield Wednesday. Wednesday manager Derek Dooley was interested in signing City's Dave Clements and watched him in a game, he was impressed with Joicey's performance in the same game and it resulted in both players joining Wednesday on 27 August for a combined fee of £100,000. Joicey made his first team debut for Wednesday four days later in an away match at Middlesbrough and scored his first goal on 4 September against Portsmouth. Joicey finished leading scorer for Wednesday in each of his first three seasons with the club, one of the highlights of his stay at Hillsborough was a hat-trick in a 3–2 FA Cup 4th round replay victory over First Division Crystal Palace at Villa Park on 19 February 1973. Brian's fourth season with Wednesday was not a success, he was plagued by injury and poor form as the team were relegated to the Third Division, he scored two goals in 23 appearances as the club tried numerous permutations in the forward line. Another unsuccessful season (1975–76) led to Joicey being signed by Fourth Division Barnsley on a free transfer in July 1976.Sheffield Wednesday Archive. Gives details of Sheffield Wednesday career. Barnsley Joicey's time with Barnsley was quite successful, scoring 43 goals in 93 league appearances. He was ever present in his first season (1976–77) and ended that campaign as Division Four's top scorer with 26 league goals, he also scored an FA Cup hat-trick against Boston United that year. His career was cut short by injury in November 1978 when he collapsed on the field in Barnsley's away match with York City. He was taken to hospital where initial tests indicated kidney damage. It was announced a few days later that the first diagnosis was wrong and he had suffered a (minor) stroke. Brian was forced to retire from professional football although he did make some appearances later in non- league football, most notably for Frickley Athletic and Matlock Town. Barnsley organised a testimonial match against a combined Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United side to mark the end of his career with Mick Channon and David Speedie taking part amongst other stars. It was also revealed during the Championship live on BBC Two between Nottingham Forest and Cardiff City on 5 April 2010 that Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Mick McCarthy used to clean Joicey's boots during their time at Barnsley together, a humorous revelation that made BBC commentator Guy Mowbray laugh and vaguely reminisce, after Mowbray commented that Cardiff City captain Jay Bothroyd used to clean Chelsea defender Ashley Cole's boots during Bothroyd's time as a trainee at Arsenal.

It was first published in Planet Stories (Fall, 1946) as \\"The Creatures That Time Forgot.\\" Plot summary Placed there by a past rocket ship that crashed, the people of the storied land are within sight of another rocket ship on a distant mountain plateau. The plot follows Sim, the protagonist of this story, and his apparently short life on a planet where people are cursed by radiation to live only eight days. The people of this planet are also gifted with racial memory (they remember their ancestors' memories). However, they do not attempt to reach the sole remaining rocket ship due to the futility of attempting to reach it in one hour, which is the longest length of time between day and night (both deadly). Sim is then moved by the memory of his ancestors to find and meet with scientists who make halting progress towards the goal of lengthening the world's decreased life span. Sim, motivated by his dwindling days, makes it his goal to extend his life and reach the distant rocket, despite the protests of his sister and other cave-dwellers.

For example, in a form of synesthesia known as grapheme-color synesthesia, letters or numbers may be perceived as inherently colored. Historically, the most commonly described form of synesthesia (or synesthesia- like mappings) has been between sound and vision, e.g. the hearing of colors in music.  Early investigations of colored hearing  The interest in colored hearing, i.e. the co-perception of color in hearing sounds or music, dates back to Greek antiquity, when philosophers were investigating whether the colour (chroia, what we now call timbre) of music was a physical quality that could be quantified.Gage, J. Colour and Culture. Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to Abstraction. (London:Thames & Hudson, 1993). The seventeenth-century physicist Isaac Newton tried to solve the problem by assuming that musical tones and colour tones have frequencies in common.Peacock, Kenneth. \\"Instruments to Perform Color-Music: Two Centuries of Technological Experimentation,\\" Leonardo 21, No. 4 (1988) 397-406. The age-old quest for colour-pitch correspondences in order to evoke perceptions of coloured music finally resulted in the construction of color organs and performances of colored music in concert halls at the end of the nineteenth century.Jewanski, J. & N. Sidler (Eds.). Farbe - Licht - Musik. Synaesthesie und Farblichtmusik. Bern: Peter Lang, 2006. (For more information, see the synesthesia in art page). John Locke in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding' (1689) reports: Whether this is an actually synesthesia, or simply reflects metaphorical speech, is debated. A similar example appears in Leibniz's New Essays on Human Understanding (written in 1704, but not published until 1764); indeed given that the New Essays is intended as a rebuttal to Locke, it may even have been the same individual. Although it is mainly speculation, there is reason to believe that the person Locke referred to was the mathematician and scientist Nicholas Saunderson, who held the Lucasian professor chair at Cambridge University, and whose general prominence would have made his statements noticeable. In Letters on the blind, Denis Diderot, one of Locke's followers, mentions Saunderson by name in related philosophical reflections. In 1710, Thomas Woolhouse reported the case of another blind man who perceived colors in response to sounds. Numerous other philosophers and scientists, including Isaac Newton (1704), Erasmus Darwin (1790) and Wilhelm Wundt (1874) may have referred to synesthesia, or at least synesthesia-like mappings between colors and musical notes. Henry David Thoreau remarked in a letter to Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1848 that a child he knew had asked him \\"if I did not use ‘colored words.’ She said that she could tell the color of a great many words, and amused the children at school by so doing.\\"Sanborn, F.B. The Writings of Henry David Thoreau, Vol. VI: Familiar Letters, part II, p. 150  19th century investigations  The first agreed upon account of synesthesia comes from German physician Georg Tobias Ludwig Sachs in 1812, who reports on his colored vowels as part of his PhD dissertation (on his albinism), although its importance has only become apparent retrospectively.Mahling, F. (1926) Das Problem der \`audition colorée': Eine historisch-kritische Untersuchung. Archiv für die gesamte Psychologie, 57, 165-301. The father of psychophysics, Gustav Fechner reported on a first empirical survey of colored letter photisms among 73 synesthetes in 1871,Fechner, Th. (1871) Vorschule der Aesthetik. Leipzig: Breitkopf und Hartel.Campen, Cretien van (1996). De verwarring der zintuigen. Artistieke en psychologische experimenten met synesthesie. Psychologie & Maatschappij, vol. 20, nr. 1, pp. 10-26. followed in the 1880s by Francis Galton.Galton, F. (1883). Inquiries into Human Faculty and its Development. London:Dent & Sons These early investigations aroused little interest, and the phenomenon was first brought to the attention of the scientific community. Research into synesthesia proceeded briskly, with researchers from England, Germany, France and the United States all investigating the phenomenon. These early research years corresponded with the founding of psychology as a scientific field (see history of psychology). By 1926, Mahling cites 533 published papers dealing with colored hearing (or hearing → color synesthesia) alone. Although there is still debate as to when the first international academic conference to seriously look at synesthesia took place, a likely candidate is the following: From 2 – 5 March 1927, Georg Anschütz (who was once a student of Alfred Binet) presided over the convening of the first Kongresse zur Farbe-Ton-Forschung (Congress for Color-Tone Research), in Hamburg, Germany. A second congress took place 1 – 5 October 1930, in Hamburg, Germany;G. Anschütz Farbe-Ton- Forschungen: Bericht über den II. Kongress für Farbe-Ton-Forschung (Hamburg, 1–5 October 1930), 1931. the third from 2 – 7 October 1933; and the 4th and final conference in this series took place 4 – 10 October 1936.Jewanski, Jörg (1999). Ist C = Rot?, Sinzig:Studio In addition to drawing concerted scientific interest, the phenomenon of synesthesia started arousing interest in the salons of fin de siecle Europe. The French Symbolist poets Arthur Rimbaud and Charles Baudelaire wrote poems which focused on synesthetic experience. Baudelaire's ' (1857) (full text available here) introduced the Romantic notion that the senses can and should intermingle. Kevin Dann argues that Baudelaire probably learned of synesthesia from reading medical textbooks that were available in his home,Dann, K. T. (1998). Bright Colors Falsely Seen: Synaesthesia and the Search for Transcendent Knowledge. Yale University Press., . and it is generally agreed that neither Baudelaire, nor Rimbaud were true synesthetes. Rimbaud, following Baudelaire, wrote Voyelles (1871) (full text available here) which was perhaps more important than ' in popularizing synesthesia. Numerous other composers, artists and writers followed suit, making synesthesia well known among the artistic community of the day. Due to the difficulties in assessing and measuring subjective internal experiences, and the rise of behaviorism in psychology, which banished any mention of internal experiences, the study of synesthesia gradually waned during the 1930s. Marks lists 44 papers discussing colored hearing from 1900 to 1940, while in the following 35 years from 1940 to 1975, only 12 papers were published on this topic. Cretien van Campen graphed the number of publications in the period 1780 - 2000 and noticed a revival of synesthesia studies from the 1980s.Campen, Cretien van (1999) Artistic and Psychological Experiments with Synesthesia. Leonardo vol. 32, nr. 1, 9-14.  Modern research  In the 1980s, as the cognitive revolution had begun to make discussion of internal states and even the study of consciousness respectable again, scientists began to once again examine this fascinating phenomenon.

Some Demographic and Socio-cultural Aspects of Synesthesia. in L. Robertson & N. Sagiv (Eds.) Synesthesia: Perspectives from Cognitive Neuroscience. Oxford:Oxford University Press.

In 2006, the journal Cortex published a special issue on synesthesia, composed of 26 articles from individual case reports to functional neuroimaging studies of the neural basis of synesthesia. Synesthesia has been the topic of several recent scientific books and novels and a recent short film has even included characters who experience synesthesia (for more information, see the main synesthesia page). Mirroring these developments in the professional community, synesthetes and synesthesia researchers have come together to found several societies dedicated to research and education about synesthesia, its consequences and uses. In 1995, the American Synesthesia Association was founded, and has been having annual meetings since 2001. In England, the UK Synaesthesia Association, arose out of a similar desire to bring together synesthetes and the people who study them, and has held two conferences (in 2005 and 2006). Similarly, since its inception in 1993, Sean A. Day has administered the \\"synesthesia list\\", an e-mail list for synesthetes and researchers around the world. With increased scientific knowledge and public outreach, awareness of this condition is growing worldwide.

Founded in 1992, the company is best known for developing multiple edutainment franchises, most prominently Putt-Putt, Freddi Fish, Pajama Sam and Spy Fox, which, combined, sold over 15 million copies and earned more than 400 awards of excellence. Humongous Entertainment was acquired by GT Interactive (later renamed Infogrames, Inc., then Atari, Inc.) in July 1996. By October 2000, sales of Humongous games had surpassed 16 million copies. GT sold Humongous to its parent company, Infogrames (later renamed Atari, SA), in August 2005, as a result of which the company was shut down a few months after. Infogrames transitioned the label to a new company, Humongous, Inc., which continued publishing games under the Humongous label until 2013, when it faced bankruptcy. As part of the bankruptcy agreement of the Atari, SA subsidiary Atari, Inc., Humongous, Inc. and Atari Interactive, Tommo acquired the Humongous brand and all of its assets, and went on to re- release some of its games into digital distribution channels in conjunction with Night Dive Studios.  History   Formation (1992–1996)  Humongous Entertainment was formed by Shelley Day and Ron Gilbert in 1992, then based in Woodinville, Washington. The name Humongous Entertainment was suggested by Gilbert's ex-LucasArts colleague, Tim Schafer. It became known for creating four point-and-click adventure game series intended for young children, branded collectively as \\"Junior Adventures\\", with the four series being the Putt-Putt series, the Freddi Fish series, the Pajama Sam series and the Spy Fox series. Despite all four series being developed and released in parallel, characters from one series do not formally cross over with ones in another and instead appear as cameos or Easter eggs in any of the three other series. The company became the third largest children's educational-software company. In 1995, Gilbert and Day established a company division, Cavedog Entertainment, in Seattle, set to develop games of alternative genres, and released Total Annihilation, a real-time strategy (RTS) game, in 1997. This was followed by two expansion packs in 1998, as well as a variation called Total Annihilation: Kingdoms plus an expansion pack in 1999.  Acquisitions, decline, dissolution (1996–2006)  On July 11, 1996, Humongous Entertainment was purchased by GT Interactive for . In November 1999, GT Interactive was acquired by Infogrames and renamed it Infogrames, Inc. In 2000, Humongous Entertainment released a One-Stop Fun Shop activity center game for each Junior Adventure series, with the exception of Spy Fox. In 2000, the co- founders tried to buy Humongous Entertainment back from Infogrames, Inc., using external funding, but the day of the planned purchase was the day of the dot-com collapse, wherefore the funding was pulled. The founders soon left Humongous, alongside many other key employees, and formed a new studio, Hulabee Entertainment, in 2001. In June 2001, Infogrames, Inc. laid off 82 personnel, over 40% of staff from Humongous Entertainment. In May 2003, after Infogrames, Inc. purchased Hasbro Interactive—which owned the rights to the Atari brand—the company was renamed Atari, Inc. In August 2005, facing financial struggles, Atari, Inc. sold Humongous Entertainment to majority stock holder Infogrames for , under the condition that all titles developed by Humongous Entertainment are released through March 31, 2006. No further game was completed by Humongous Entertainment in the given time, and the company was dissolved the day after. Infogrames then transitioned all assets and brands to a newly established company, Humongous, Inc., not bound to any agreement from Atari, Inc., which would go on to publish several titles under the Humongous name until 2009, mainly with Majesco Entertainment. By that time, Majesco had released ports of the first installments of each Junior Adventure series, except Putt-Putt, to the Wii, taking advantage of the Wii Remote's point-and-click functionality, but their availability was greatly limited by a legal conflict concerning their development.  Asset sale, brand revival (2013–2015)  Finding itself in a difficult financial situation, Infogrames (then renamed Atari, SA), filed bankruptcy for three of its American subsidiaries, Atari, Inc., Atari Interactive and Humongous, Inc. in 2013. As part of the resolution proceedings, the Humongous brand and most game assets were transferred to Tommo on July 19, 2013. Furthermore, the Backyard Sports series was acquired by The Evergreen Group, and MoonBase Commander by Rebellion Developments. Using the trademark, Tommo re-launched the Humongous.com website in January 2014, and, together with Night Dive Studios, went on to re-release several Humongous Entertainment titles under the Humongous Entertainment label into digital distribution channels Steam, between April 2014 and August 2015.

The tower contains approximately on 27 floors and is in the brutalist architectural style. The corners are recessed providing additional strength to the structure and eliminating the battle for corner offices. The building is surrounded by a large plaza which covers the concourse level, parking garage, loading dock and a sunken fountain. In 1987, the tall modern sculpture Detroit Deliquescence by John Chamberlain was installed on the plaza. The sculpture, which consists of crushed auto body panels, was commissioned under the Art in Architecture program by General Services Administration (GSA) in 1977 for $100,000. However, it could not be placed at its intended location due to deterioration of the plaza. After the GSA and building's contractor reached a settlement for repairs, it was installed in 1987. Between the time of its completion in 1983 and 1987, the sculpture was placed at Walter P. Reuther Library of Labor and Urban Affairs on the campus of nearby Wayne State University. From the time of its installation at Wayne State, the sculpture proved unpopular with critics and members of the public. During additional repairs to the plaza in 2001, the sculpture was removed and sent for conservation. The years of exposure to the elements caused damage and GSA made the decision to relocate it to an interior space. After a two-year search for a recipient, the College for Creative Studies agreed to accept the work for its new A. Alfred Taubman Center for Design Education. It was installed for the center's opening in 2009. The lobby of the building houses two works, an acrylic and fiber painting by Sam Gilliam entitled Box Cars Grand and an oil on panel piece by Harold Cohn called Decorative Map of Belle Isle. On September 22, 2001, a Federal Officer was killed in the lobby by a visitor who became angry when told he would not be able to take his gun into the building.

Biography Born in Avilés in Asturias, son of a painter with the same name, Juan Carreño de Miranda. His family moved to Madrid in 1623, and he trained in Madrid during the late 1620s as an apprentice to Pedro de las Cuevas and Bartolomé Román. He came to the notice of Velázquez for his work in the cloister of Doña María de Aragón and in the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary (Iglesia de la Virgen del Rosario), , La Joyosa. In 1658, Carreño was hired as an assistant on a royal commission to paint frescoes in the Alcázar of Madrid; later destroyed in the fire of 1734. In 1671, upon the death of Sebastián de Herrera, he was appointed court painter to the queen (pintor de cámara) and began to paint primarily portraits. He refused to be knighted in the Order of Santiago, saying \\"Painting needs no honors, it can give them to the whole world\\". He is mainly recalled as a painter of portraits. His main pupils were Mateo Cerezo, Juan Martín Cabezalero, José Jiménez Donoso and José de Ledesma.An account of the lives and works of the most eminent Spanish painters, sculptors and architects He died in Madrid. Noble by descent, he had an understanding of the workings and psychology of the royal court as no painter before him, making his portraits of the Spanish royal family in an unprecedented documentary fashion.

Beiriz is a suburban area in Póvoa de Varzim, Portugal. It is an ancient ecclesiastical parish and former civil parish. In the census of 2001, it had a population of 3,229 inhabitants and a total area of 4.31 km². A 2012 law merged the parish with neighbouring Póvoa de Varzim (parish) and Argivai, becoming the southern parish of the city of Póvoa de Varzim, known as União das Freguesias da Póvoa de Varzim, Beiriz e Argivai. Beiriz is known for its Tapetes de Beiriz (Beiriz carpets). History Beiriz has origins in a medieval rural place known as Villa Viarizi as it is known by a document from 1044. The parish is very old, and it is known to exist from at least from this century onwards. It was a (religious) parish in Barcelos until 1836 when it became a civil unit and was transferred to Vila do Conde. Póvoa de Varzim and Vila do Conde made parish transfers in 1853, and Beiriz was made part of Póvoa de Varzim since then. Geography Beiriz is located 4 km from downtown Póvoa de Varzim. Due to its unusual borders and border dispute with parishes in its vicinity: Póvoa de Varzim (Parish), Amorim and Aver-o-Mar, part of the parish is located in the city core, while most of it is in the suburban area of the city.

Following the couple’s divorce, Lavoyda moved the family to Lovington, New Mexico where she later married Troy Lenard. During his high school years, Urlacher distinguished himself as a premier football player, helping Lovington High School record a 14-0 season. Together, Casey and his older brother, Brian, earned a prodigious reputation around Lovington. Following Brian’s graduation, Casey was promoted to captain of the football team. Also, outside of football, Urlacher ran track and played basketball and baseball. College career Urlacher spent his first two years of college at the New Mexico Military Institute. During his first two years, he only managed to play for one season, while redshirting the other. In 2000, Urlacher moved in with his brother Brian in his house in Lake Bluff, Illinois, and attended Lake Forest College playing with the team for three seasons. Professional football career Urlacher was not selected in the 2003 NFL Draft. The Chicago Bears granted him a professional try-out during their training camp in 2003, but Urlacher failed to make the final roster. The Chicago Rush arena football team signed him to play as a fullback and linebacker, but Urlacher failed to make the team's roster after training camp and was released. Upon his release, Casey signed with the Peoria Pirates of af2, then the Nashville Kats before being cut in 2005 and joining the Chicago Rush again for a short time. Civic and political career In April 2013, Urlacher was elected Mayor of the Village of Mettawa, Illinois, having won 61% of the vote.

In Chinese mythology, the term \\"cosmogonic myth\\" or \\"origin myth\\" is more accurate than \\"creation myth\\", since very few stories involve a creator deity or divine will. Chinese creation myths fundamentally differ from monotheistic traditions with one authorized version, such as the Judeo-Christian Genesis creation myth: Chinese classics record numerous and contradictory origin myths. Traditionally, the world was created on Chinese New Year and the animals, people, and many deities were created during its 15 days. Some Chinese cosmogonic myths have familiar themes in comparative mythology. For example, creation from chaos (Chinese Hundun and Hawaiian Kumulipo), dismembered corpses of a primordial being (Pangu and Mesopotamian Tiamat), world parent siblings (Fuxi and Nüwa and Japanese Izanagi and Izanami), and dualistic cosmology (yin and yang and Zoroastrian Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu). In contrast, other mythic themes are uniquely Chinese. While the mythologies of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece believed primeval water was the single element that existed \\"in the beginning\\", the basic element of Chinese cosmology was qi (\\"breath; air; life force\\"). Anne Birrell explains that qi \\"was believed to embody cosmic energy governing matter, time, and space. This energy, according to Chinese mythic narratives, undergoes a transformation at the moment of creation, so that the nebulous element of vapor becomes differentiated into dual elements of male and female, Yin and Yang, hard and soft matter, and other binary elements.\\" Cosmogonic mythologies Tao Te Ching The Tao Te Ching, written sometime before the 4th century , suggests a less mythical Chinese cosmogony and has some of the earliest allusions to creation. > There was something featureless yet complete, born before heaven and earth; > Silent—amorphous—it stood alone and unchanging. We may regard it as the > mother of heaven and earth. Commonly styled \\"The Way.\\" > The Way gave birth to unity, Unity gave birth to duality, Duality gave birth > to trinity, Trinity gave birth to the myriad creatures. The myriad creatures > bear yin on their back and embrace yang in their bosoms. They neutralize > these vapors and thereby achieve harmony. Later Taoists interpreted this sequence to mean the Tao (Dao, \\"Way\\"), formless (Wuji, \\"Without Ultimate\\"), unitary (Taiji, \\"Great Ultimate\\"), and binary (yin and yang or Heaven and Earth). Girardot reasons that Tao Te Ching evokes the Tao as \\"a cosmic principle of the beginnings would seem to make little sense without seeing the possibility that it was rooted in the symbolic remembrance of archaic mythological, especially cosmogonic, themes.\\" Songs of Chu The \\"Heavenly Questions\\" section of the \\"Chu Ci\\", written around the 4th century , begins by asking catechistic questions about creation myths. Birrell calls it \\"the most valuable document in Chinese mythography\\" and surmises an earlier date for its mythos \\"since it clearly draws on a preexisting fund of myths.\\" > Who passed down the story of the far-off, ancient beginning of things? How > can we be sure what it was like before the sky above and the earth below had > taken shape? Since none could penetrate that murk when darkness and light > were yet undivided, how do we know about the chaos of insubstantial forms? > What manner of things are the darkness and light? How did Yin and Yang come > together, and how did they originate and transform all things that are by > their commingling? Whose compass measured out the ninefold heavens? Whose > work was this, and how did he accomplish it? Where were the circling cords > fastened, and where was the sky's pole fixed? Where did the Eight Pillars > meet the sky, and why were they too short for it in the south-east? Where do > the nine fields of heaven extend to and where do they join each other? The > ins and outs of their edges must be very many: who knows their number? How > does heaven coordinate its motions? Where are the Twelve Houses divided? How > do the sun and the moon hold to their courses and the fixed stars keep their > places? Birrell describes this Chu creation narrative as a \\"vivid world picture. It mentions no prime cause, no first creator. From the \\"formless expanse\\" the primeval element of misty vapor emerges spontaneously as a creative force, which is organically constructed as a set of binary forces in opposition to each other-upper and lower spheres, darkness and light, Yin and Yang – whose mysterious transformations bring about the ordering of the universe.\\". A Taoist diagram of the creation of the \\"myriad things\\" from the original unity through the yin-yang and trigrams. Daoyuan The Daoyuan (, \\"Origins of the Tao\\") is one of the Huangdi Sijing manuscripts discovered in 1973 among the Mawangdui Silk Texts excavated from a tomb dated to 168. Like the Songs of Chu above, this text is believed to date from the 4th century and from the same southern state of Chu. This Taoist cosmogonic myth describes the creation of the universe and humans out of formless misty vapor, and Birrell notes the striking resemblance between its ancient \\"all was one\\" concept of unity before creation and the modern cosmogonic concept of gravitational singularity. > At the beginning of eternal past all things penetrated and were identical > with great vacuity, Vacuous and identical with the One, rest at the One > eternally. Unsettled and confusing, there was no distinction of dark and > light. Though Tao is undifferentiated, it is autonomous: \\"It has no cause > since ancient times\\", yet \\"the ten thousand things are caused by it without > any exception\\". Tao is great and universal on the one hand, but also > formless and nameless. Taiyi Shengshui The 4th or 3rd century Taiyi Shengshui (\\"Great One Giving Birth to Water\\"), a Taoist text recently excavated in the Guodian Chu Slips, seems to offer its own unique creation myth, but analysis remains uncertain. Huainanzi The 139 Huainanzi, an eclectic text compiled under the direction of the Han prince Liu An, contains two cosmogonic myths that develop the dualistic concept of Yin and Yang: > When Heaven and Earth were yet unformed, all was ascending and flying, > diving and delving. Thus it was called the Grand Inception. The Grand > Inception produced the Nebulous Void. The Nebulous Void produced space-time, > space-time produced the original qi. A boundary [divided] the original qi. > That which was pure and bright spread out to form Heaven; that which was > heavy and turbid congealed to form Earth. It is easy for that which is pure > and subtle to converge but difficult for the heavy and turbid to congeal. > Therefore, Hell was completed first; Earth was fixed afterward.

Birrell suggests this abstract Yin-Yang dualism between the two primeval spirits or gods may be the \\"vestige of a much older mythological paradigm that was then rationalized and diminished\\", comparable to the Akkadian Enûma Eliš creation myth of Abzu and Tiamat, male fresh water and female salt water. Lingxian Zhou's Taiji tushuo diagram The Lingxian (), written around 120 by the polymath Zhang Heng, thoroughly accounts for the creation of Heaven and Earth. > Before the Great Plainness [or Great Basis, Taisu, ] came to be, there was > dark limpidity and mysterious quiescence, dim and dark.

Later texts The Neo-Confucianist philosopher Zhou Dunyi provided a multifaceted cosmology in his Taiji Tushuo (, \\"Diagram Explaining the Supreme Ultimate\\"), which integrated the I Ching with Taoism and Chinese Buddhism. Creation mythologies Han-era mural depicting Nüwa with a compass and Fuxi with a square In contrast to the above Chinese cosmogonic myths about the world and humans originating spontaneously without a creator (e.g., from \\"refined vital energy\\" in the Huainanzi), two later origin myths for humans involve divinities. The female Nüwa fashioned people from loess and mud (in early myths) or from procreating with her brother/husband Fuxi (in later versions). Myths about the male Pangu say that people derived from mites on his corpse. Nüwa In Chinese mythology, the goddess Nüwa repaired the fallen pillars holding up the sky, creating human beings either before or after. The ancient Chinese believed in a square earth and a round, domelike sky supported by eight giant pillars (cf. the European ideas of an axis mundi). The \\"Heavenly Questions\\" of the Songs of Chu from around the 4th century is the first surviving text that refers to Nüwa: \\"By what law was Nü Wa raised up to become high lord? By what means did she fashion the different creatures?\\" Two Huainanzi chapters record Nüwa mythology two centuries later: > Going back to more ancient times, the four [of 8] pillars were broken; the > nine provinces were in tatters. Heaven did not completely cover [the earth]; > Earth did not hold up [Heaven] all the way around [its circumference]. Fires > blazed out of control and could not be extinguished; water flooded in great > expanses and would not recede. Ferocious animals ate blameless people; > predatory birds snatched the elderly and the weak. Thereupon, Nüwa smelted > together five-colored stones in order to patch up the azure sky, cut off the > legs of the great turtle to set them up as the four pillars, killed the > black dragon to provide relief for Ji Province, and piled up reeds and > cinders to stop the surging waters. The azure sky was patched; the four > pillars were set up; the surging waters were drained; the province of Ji was > tranquil; crafty vermin died off; blameless people [preserved their] lives. > Bearing the square [nine] provinces on her back and embracing Heaven, [Fuxi > and Nüwa established] the harmony of spring and the yang of summer, the > slaughtering of autumn and the restraint of winter. > The Yellow Emperor produced yin and yang. Shang Pian produced ears and eyes; > Sang Lin produced shoulders and arms. Nüwa used these to carry out the > seventy transformations? Shang Pian () and Sang Lin () are obscure mythic divinities. The commentary of Xu Shen written around 100 says \\"seventy transformations\\" refers to Nuwa's power to create everything in the world. The Fengsu Tongyi (\\"Common Meanings in Customs\\"), written by Ying Shao around 195, describes Han-era beliefs about the primeval goddess. > People say that when Heaven and earth opened and unfolded, humankind did not > yet exist, Nü Kua kneaded yellow earth and fashioned human beings. Though > she worked feverishly, she did not have enough strength to finish her task, > so she drew her cord in a furrow through the mud and lifted it out to make > human beings. That is why rich aristocrats are the human beings made from > yellow earth, while ordinary poor commoners are the human beings made from > the cord's furrow. Birrell identifies two worldwide mythic motifs in Ying Shao's account. Myths commonly say the first humans were created from clay, dirt, soil, or bone; Nüwa used mud and loess. Myths widely refer to social stratification; Nüwa created the rich from loess and the poor from mud. In contrast, the builder's cord motif is uniquely Chinese and iconographic of the Goddess. In Han iconography, Nüwa sometimes holds a builder's compass. The 9th-century Duyi Zhi (, \\"A Treatise on Extraordinary Things\\") by Li Rong records a later tradition that Nüwa and her brother Fuxi were the first humans. In this version, the goddess has been demoted from \\"primal creatrix to a mortal subservient to God in Heaven\\" and a \\"lowly female subservient to the male, in the traditional manner of marital relations.\\" > Long ago, when the world first began, there were two people, Nü Kua and her > older brother. They lived on Mount K'un-lun. And there were not yet any > ordinary people in the world. They talked about becoming husband and wife, > but they felt ashamed. So the brother at once went with his sister up Mount > K'un-lun and made this prayer: \\"Oh Heaven, if Thou wouldst send us two forth > as man and wife, then make all the misty vapor gather. If not, then make all > the misty vapor disperse.\\" At this, the misty vapor immediately gathered. > When the sister became intimate with her brother, they plaited some grass to > make a fan to screen their faces. Even today, when a man takes a wife, they > hold a fan, which is a symbol of what happened long ago. Pangu One of the most popular creation myths in Chinese mythology describes the first-born semidivine human Pangu (, \\"Coiled Antiquity\\") separating the world egg-like Hundun (, \\"primordial chaos\\") into Heaven and Earth. However, none of the ancient Chinese classics mentions the Pangu myth, which was first recorded in the 3rd-century Sanwu Liji (, \\"Historical Records of the Three Sovereign Divinities and the Five Gods\\"), attributed to the Three Kingdoms period Taoist author Xu Zheng. Thus, in classical Chinese mythology, Nüwa predates Pangu by six centuries. > Heaven and earth were in chaos like a chicken's egg, and Pangu was born in > the middle of it. In eighteen thousand years Heaven and the earth opened and > unfolded. The limpid that was Yang became the heavens, the turbid that was > Yin became the earth. Pangu lived within them, and in one day he went > through nine transformations, becoming more divine than Heaven and wiser > than earth. Each day the heavens rose ten feet higher, each day the earth > grew ten feet thicker, and each day Pangu grew ten feet taller. And so it > was that in eighteen thousand years the heavens reached their fullest > height, earth reached its lowest depth, and Pangu became fully grown. > Afterwards, there was the Three Sovereign Divinities. Numbers began with > one, were established with three, perfected by five, multiplied with seven, > and fixed with nine. That is why Heaven is ninety thousand leagues from > earth. Like the Sanwu Liji, the Wuyun Linian Ji (, \\"A Chronicle of the Five Cycles of Time\\") is another 3rd-century text attributed to Xu Zheng. This version details the cosmological metamorphosis of Pangu's microcosmic body into the macrocosm of the physical world. > When the firstborn, Pangu, was approaching death, his body was transformed. > His breath became the wind and clouds; his voice became peals of thunder. > His left eye became the sun; his right eye became the moon. His four limbs > and five extremities became the four cardinal points and the five peaks. His > blood and semen became water and rivers. His muscles and veins became the > earth's arteries; his flesh became fields and land. His hair and beard > became the stars; his bodily hair became plants and trees. His teeth and > bones became metal and rock; his vital marrow became pearls and jade. His > sweat and bodily fluids became streaming rain. All the mites on his body > were touched by the wind and evolved into the black-haired people. Lincoln found parallels between Pangu and the Indo-European world parent myth, such as the primeval being's flesh becoming earth and hair becoming plants. Western scholarship Norman J. Girardot, professor of Chinese religion at Lehigh University, analyzed complications within studies of Chinese creation mythology. On the one hand, > With regard to China there is the very real problem of the extreme paucity > and fragmentation of mythological accounts, an almost total absence of any > coherent mythic narratives dating to the early periods of Chinese culture. > This is even more true with respect to authentic cosmogonic myths, since the > preserved fragments are extremely meager and in most cases are secondary > accounts historicized and moralized by the redactors of the Confucian school > that was emerging as the predominant classical tradition during the Former > Han period. On the other hand, there are issues with what Girardot calls the \\"China as a special case fallacy\\"; presuming that unlike \\"other ancient cultures more blatantly caught up in the throes of religion and myth\\", China did not have any creation myths, with the exception of Pangu, which was a late, and likely foreign, importation. Girardot traces the origins of this \\"methodological rigidity\\" or \\"benign neglect\\" for the study of Chinese religion and mythology back to early 19th-century missionary scholars who sought creation myths in early Chinese texts, \\"the concern for the study of Chinese cosmogony on the part of the missionaries resulted in a frustration over not finding anything that resembled the Christian doctrine of a rational creator God.\\" For instance, the missionary and translator Walter Henry Medhurst claimed Chinese religions suffered because \\"'no first cause' characterizes all the sects\\", \\"the Supreme, self-existent God is scarcely traceable through the entire range of their metaphysics\\", and the whole system of Chinese cosmogony \\"is founded in materialism\\". This \\"China as a special case\\" theory became an article of faith among 20th-century scholars. The French sinologist Marcel Granet's influential Chinese Thought said: > it is necessary to notice the privileged place given to politics by the > Chinese. For them, the history of the world does not start before the start > of civilization. It does not originate by a recitation of a creation or by > cosmological speculations, but with the biographies of the sage kings. The > biographies of the ancient heroes of China contain numerous mythic elements; > but no cosmogonic theme has entered into the literature without having > undergone a transformation. All of the legends pretend to report the facts > of a human history.... The predominance accorded to political preoccupation > is accompanied for the Chinese by a profound repulsion for all theories of > creation. Some further examples are: * \\"In contrast to other nations the Chinese have no mythological cosmogony; the oldest sources already attempt to account for creation in a scientific way.\\" * \\"It is rather striking that, aside from this one myth [concerning Pangu], China—perhaps alone among the major civilizations of antiquity—has no real story of creation. This situation is paralleled by what we find in Chinese philosophy, where, from the very start, there is a keen interest in the relationship of man to man and in the adjustment of man to the physical universe, but relatively little interest in cosmic origins.\\" * \\"…the Chinese, amongst all peoples ancient and recent, primitive and modern, are apparently unique in having no creation myth; that is, they have regarded the world and man as uncreated, as constituting the central features of a spontaneously self-generating cosmos having no creator, god, ultimate cause, or will external to itself.\\" See also * Korean creation narratives * Japanese creation myth Notes References Citations Bibliography * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * .

He is generally known as the most prolific guitarist of the 17th century, publishing seven books during his lifetime. Along with many pieces in the standard dance genre of that time, Granata also composed many instrumental toccatas, preludes, and chaconnes. Granata was a barber-surgeon by profession.Tyler, James and Paul Sparks, The Guitar and its Music from the Renaissance to the Classical Era (Oxford University Press: 2002), 74.  Biography  Granata was born in Turin, but moved to Bologna sometime around 1646 where remained for the majority of his life. From 1651 to 1653, he was employed as liutista sopranumerario in the Concerto Palatino. Although he maintained his teaching and composing career throughout his life, his main employment was as a barber-surgeon for which he became licensed in 1659.  Music/Style  The early baroque guitar works of Granata are characterized by their French organization of dance suites (allemande, courante, and sarabande). His style in the period around 1646 is very similar to that of his contemporary, Giovanni Paolo Foscarini. The works from Granata's middle period demonstrate his musical evolution and change in style. Many of the pieces are complex and regarded as some of the most virtuosic guitar music of that time. Granata's later period pushes the instrument even further with extensive use of , notes in the upper register, and complex rhythms. Granata's fourth book - Soavi concenti (1659) - is one of the few sources to include pieces for the chitarra atiorbata, a five course instrument with seven open basses. Three of Granata's books also have works for ensemble. The pieces contained in Book IV call for a chamber ensemble of violin, guitar, and basso continuo, Book V for violin, viola, and guitar, and Book VII for guitar and basso continuo.  Works  Granata's seven books, all published in Bologna, Italy: * I- Capricci armonici sopra la chitarriglia spagnuola (1646) * II- Nuove suonate di chitarriglia spagnuola piccicate, e battute (ca. 1650) * III- Nuova scelta di caprici armonici, Op. 3 (1651) * IV- Soavi concenti di sonate musicali per la chitarra spagnuola, Op. 4 (1659) * V- Novi capricci armonici musicali in vari toni per la chitarra spagnola, violino, e viola concertati, et altre sonate per la chitarra sola, Op. 5 (1674) * VI- Nuovi sovavi concenti di sonate musicali in varii toni per la chitarra spagnola, et altre sonate concertate a due violini, e basso, Op. 6 (1680) * VII- Armonici toni di vari suonate musicali concertante, a due violini, e basso, con la chitarra spagnola, Op. 7 (1684)  Similarity with 20th century work \\"Stairway to Heaven\\"  Granata's Sonata di Chitarra, e Violino, con il suo Basso Continuo appeared in a surprising connection with a 1970 rock music work, Stairway to Heaven, by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant of the rock group Led Zeppelin. After Stairway to Heaven achieved tremendous success, a dispute arose about whether part of the work was plagiarised. Commentators cited numerous earlier works with some degree of similarity, including Granata's Sonata. However, similarity was not evidence that Page and Plant plagiarised Granata.  References  6\\\\.

The arrangement of the coil and magnets is significantly different to most other pickup designs. Tri-Sonics are wider than the more popular single-coiled pickups, such as used by Fender, so if Fender pickups are replaced with Tri- Sonics physical changes to the guitar may be required, such as routing the body or altering the mounting mechanism. There is also a mini Tri-Sonic, designed to fit directly into Fender style pick- guards.http://www.burnsguitars.com/minitrisonicpickup.php Construction The construction of a Tri-Sonic pickup is unconventional. The coil is not held in a rigid shape on a bobbin, as in most guitar pickups, but wound into an oval and fitted directly around the magnets. There are two magnets joined end-to- end by their magnetic attraction, and placed onto the flanged metal base. A cover is attached which fits over magnetic flanges running either side of the base. There are six holes in the pickup cover, through which can be seen a piece of black plastic which is glued to the inside. These are simply for appearance, not being any kind of pole piece. The flanged base causes the magnetic field to be produced all around the coil, not simply in the center. The Tri-Sonic gets its name from the three points where the sounds is picked up from. This is unique for a guitar pickup and produces a richer harmonic sound than conventional pickups. History First manufactured in 1960, Tri- Sonic pickups were fitted in many Burns guitars in the early 1960s. A variation of them for bass guitar was also produced.

From 1945 onwards its premises were in Somerset, England. It closed in July 1996, when most staff and pupils transferred to the new Farleigh College. History Beckington Castle pictured in 2015 Ravenscroft was founded by Mr Henry F. Bailey as a preparatory school for boys at Yelverton, Devon, in 1931.The Journal of Education, 1937, p. 611The Public and Preparatory Schools Year Book 1954, p. 666 In the course of its existence, it had at least three different homes. Its first home was a house at Yelverton called Ravenscroft House, on the edge of Yelverton Common, with views over Dartmoor. This was previously known as 'Hayesleigh' and is now the Ravenscroft Care Home.Hayesleigh, now Ravenscroft House at Yelverton, Devon, England: in the late 1890s to early 1900s In 1941, during the Second World War, a new but temporary Royal Air Force airfield called RAF Harrowbeer was constructed on part of Roborough Down close to Yelverton, and Ravenscroft House was requisitioned to become the officers' mess.RAF HARROWBEER YELVERTON Miscellaneous Information The school closed at Yelverton, and Mr Bailey left to teach temporarily at the Junior School section of Monkton Combe School from 1942 to 1944.The Magpie Magazines, Monkton Combe School In 1945, with his wife Mary, H. F. Bailey re-established his own school, at Beckington Castle in the village of Beckington, Somerset. This had previously been the home of Captain John Hamilton, Coldstream Guards, later 3rd Baron Hamilton of Dalzell, and it was the birthplace of his second son the politician Archie Hamilton, Baron Hamilton of Epsom.'Births' column of The Times, Friday, 2 January 1942, p. 1 About 1961, Bailey sold the school to a Mr Grantham Hill, and in January 1963 it was taken over by Mr and Mrs J. F. R. Gillam. In February 1966, a major fire began in the Castle's boiler room and parts of the interior were destroyed.History at Beckington.org, accessed 30 June 2019 The school closed for a week, then continued to operate in its outbuildings while the extensive damage was made good. In the year 1970, growing numbers of pupils led to a move to a larger country house called Farleigh House, near the village of Farleigh Hungerford. It had previously been owned by Earl Cairns and members of the Hely-Hutchinson family, a branch of the Earls of Donoughmore. In the late 1960s, while still at Beckington, the school had established a specialist unit which taught children who were dyslexic, and during the 1970s this unit increased in size until by 1980 the school was reclassified as a special school for children with dyslexia and other learning difficulties. During the 1980s, the age range of children taught changed. As a preparatory school, the range had been from five to thirteen, at which point children proceeded to secondary schools. As a special school, 'O' Level courses (later GCSE) were introduced, and children stayed at Ravenscroft until the age of sixteen or seventeen.Freeman, David, Choosing the Right School: A Parents Guide (London, Routledge, 1983, ) p. 161 at books.google.co.uk By the year 1995, the school's age range was from eleven to seventeen. The number of pupils was then sixty-six, of whom eleven were girls, and expenditure per pupil was £21,609, with a pupil:teacher ratio of 3.4 to one. All children were boarders, and lived either at the main school or at Houlton Hall, or two houses owned by the school in the neighbouring town of Trowbridge. There was a Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme, and some pupils attended courses at Trowbridge College. In July 1996, Ravenscroft School was closed, and most of its pupils and staff transferred to a new educational institution on the same site called Farleigh College. In September 2000 this moved to Newbury House near Mells, Somerset, and for the next year the Farleigh Hungerford site was operated as the \\"Farleigh Further Education College\\", which continued the education of some of the older students at Farleigh House until a five-year lease on it expired in September 2001.

Designed by Curtis D. Summers to resemble Bobs, a popular roller coaster at the defunct Riverview Park in Chicago, Raging Wolf Bobs was constructed by the Dinn Corporation and opened to the public in 1988. It operated until June 16, 2007, following an accident involving the derailing of a train that unexpectedly rolled backward on one of the track's hills. Later that season, park owners Cedar Fair announced the permanent closure of Geauga Lake, sealing the fate of Raging Wolf Bobs. History Geauga Lake owner Funtime, Inc. planned to add a new roller coaster – the first in ten years – to celebrate the park's centennial anniversary in 1988. Dinn Corporation was hired to install the new ride with the help of Curtis D. Summers, who modeled the design of the roller coaster after Bobs, a famous coaster from the 1920s which operated at Chicago's Riverview Park until 1967. After an investment of $2.5 million, Raging Wolf Bobs opened to the public on May 28, 1988. It was marketed with the slogan \\"The Legend of Terror Returns\\". Following the park's permanent closure in 2007, Raging Wolf Bobs was sold in an auction to an unnamed buyer for $2,500 on June 17, 2008. In 2011, the coaster's slow dismantling began, and it was completed by early 2014. Incident On June 16, 2007, a train failed to climb a hill and rolled backward. The last car of a train partially derailed in the process, but there were no injuries. The incident, which caused significant damage, sidelined the attraction for the remainder of the season. Geauga Lake owner Cedar Fair announced the permanent closure of the amusement park on September 21, 2007, ending the attraction's run at Geauga Lake.

Featuring over 130 stores and restaurants, the mall is located at the intersection of Hillsdale Boulevard and El Camino Real or CA-82, adjacent to the Hillsdale Caltrain Station and the former site of Bay Meadows Racetrack. The property is owned by Bohannon Development Co. History Developer David D. Bohannon acquired from Burleigh H. Murray in the Beresford (later called Hillsdale) neighborhood in 1939-40 and began developing the area, starting construction on the Andrew Williams Grocery Store at the corner of Hillsdale Boulevard and El Camino Real in 1941. Sears selected the Hillsdale site for one of its earliest suburban stores in 1948, and the Hillsdale Shopping Center master plan was completed in 1952; Bohannon was reportedly inspired by the recently completed Westlake Shopping Center in Daly City. In December 1954, Hillsdale Shopping Center opened as an open-air center,  promotional film featuring Sears (completed in 1949) and the first suburban branch store of Macy's San Francisco, later adding Emporium in 1962. Sculptures by Benny Bufano were commissioned for the mall in the 1950s. By 1970, Hillsdale had more than 150 stores. Through the 1960s and 70s, Hillsdale Shopping Center marked the northern end of a popular Friday night cruise route along El Camino Real for young drivers. Bufano sculpture Competition with Fashion Island In 1982, faced with competition from San Diego-based developer The Hahn Company's Fashion Island shopping center less than two miles to the north, Hillsdale underwent a major renovation under the leadership of Bohannon's daughter, Frances Bohannon Nelson. The outdoor shopping center was leveled and replaced with a modern two-level enclosed mall, encompassing Macy's and The Emporium along with two new anchors: Mervyn's at the mall's north end and Northern California's first Nordstrom. Fashion Island struggled from inception and gradually lost tenants until its closure in 1996. Bridgepointe, an outdoor power center and office park, sits on the former Fashion Island site. Changing anchors In 1995, the merger between Emporium parent company Broadway Stores and Macy's led to the closure of the mall's Emporium anchor. Sears traded its building across from the mall for the former Emporium building, and moved into the mall proper in 1996. The next major change for the property came in 2008 with the bankruptcy and subsequent liquidation of Mervyn's. The building was subdivided between three major tenants: The Cheesecake Factory and H&M; on the building's ground floor, and Forever 21 occupying the building's second level and part of the first. The mall's Crate & Barrel store, which had opened in 1996, became outmoded with the opening of larger stores in San Francisco and Palo Alto and shuttered in 2011. Paul Martin's American Grill opened in the former Crate & Barrel in 2013. North block reconstruction The next renovation at Hillsdale started with a March 2013 planning document, filed with the city of San Mateo, detailing plans to replace Sears with a three-story Target, adding a nine-screen luxury cinema, and relocating the food court from its location in the Sears/Cost Plus Building north of 31st Street to the second-story bridge over 31st; the bridge links the north Sears Building with the main mall building between 31st and Hillsdale. The plans also included a new building at the northwest corner of El Camino and 31st, to be built when a tenant was secured. In December 2013, however, Bohannon put the proposed project on hold, citing changing market conditions. Although Sears stated they had no plans to close the store at the time the plans were made public in 2013, the company later announced in 2016 the April closure of the Hillsdale store. Because Target pulled back, the 2013 proposal, which would have reused the existing Sears building north of 31st, was re-imagined and re-introduced in November 2014. Also partly in response to public and official feedback, Bohannon presented a modified version of the 2013 plans in February 2015, dropping the idea of building a three-story Target in favor of a bowling alley and fitness center, as the mall sought to be an experiential destination, pivoting away from retail space, in the face of competition from online shopping. Planning officials asked Bohannon to consider incorporating housing as a mixed-use project, but a spokesman for the company said San Mateo's height restrictions made it unfeasible. The plans were approved in March 2016. Sears closed in April 2016.https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2016/01/14/sears-confirms- closing-date-for-san-mateo-store.html Demolition of the former Sears building started on August 25, 2016. New North Block under construction (Oct 2018) Construction on the replacement North Block buildings, which are planned to achieve LEED Gold certification, is expected to continue through fall 2018, with the luxury cinema scheduled to open in late 2017. Estimated completion dates were updated to spring 2019 in March 2018, with the new dining area set to open on November 17, 2018. Hillsdale, along with Bellevue Square, NorthPark Center and South Coast Plaza, is one of the few major shopping centers to remain in private ownership, continuing to be owned by the Bohannon family.

Playing career Born in Walthamstow, Gibson was educated at Highams Park School in Highams Park, London. He started his career at Tottenham Hotspur, making his first team debut at the age of 17 years and 6 days, before moving to Coventry City in 1983. In 1981, he was loaned out to the Swedish team GAIS, who in that time played in the Swedish second division. At Coventry, his impressive tally of 52 goals in just over 100 appearances (including a hat-trick in Coventry's famous 4-0 league win over Liverpool at Highfield Road in December 1983) earned him a high-profile transfer to Manchester United in January 1986. His arrival came when Mark Hughes was in the process of agreeing a transfer to FC Barcelona of Spain for the end of the season, and manager Ron Atkinson was looking to buy a new striker. However, with Hughes not leaving until the close season and his strike partner Frank Stapleton staying put, Gibson spent most of his time on the bench and his chances of first team action barely improved even when Hughes left as Atkinson had since signed striker Peter Davenport. The Reds had been top of the league when Gibson had joined them but a disappointing second half of the season sucked them down to fourth place, and Atkinson was sacked in early November following a terrible start to the 1986-87 season. His successor Alex Ferguson did not appear to want to keep Gibson at United, and with the arrival of Brian McClair in the 1987 close season Gibson was on his way out of Old Trafford after just 18 months. He later was a part of the Wimbledon team that won the 1988 FA Cup Final against Liverpool. Other clubs include Swindon Town, Peterborough United and Barnet as player coach alongside Ray Clemence, while he also had brief stints as a trialist with Charlton Athletic and as a non-contract player with Tottenham, but did not play in either club's first team during those spells. Post- playing career Gibson had spells as youth team coach and caretaker manager at Barnet after retiring from playing in 1995. He was also coach of the Northern Ireland national team, assisting his former Wimbledon teammate Lawrie Sanchez to victories over England, Spain and Sweden among others. Prior to this he was assistant manager at Wycombe Wanderers, also working alongside Sanchez where together they guided the third-tier team to the FA Cup semi- finals in 2001 where they were narrowly defeated 2-1 by Liverpool. He was also appointed as coach of Premier League club Fulham in April 2007 assisting in the survival of the club in the Premier League. Gibson left the club after the departure of Sanchez in December 2007. He works as a co-commentator on Sky Sports' coverage of Spanish football. Gibson gained extensive experience of Spanish football while working as a scout for Premier League clubs Bolton Wanderers and Manchester City. He combined this role with coaching Northern Ireland and was based in Southern Spain. Personal life Gibson is married to Paula and they have two children. He is a self-confessed Tottenham Hotspur fan, having played for them in the early part of his career.\\"Modric a must have?\\", Sky Sports, 28 August 2012. Retrieved on 29 August 2012.

Quote: \\"Although [Patricia Monaghan]'s visions are often ecstatic, her images are grounded. She was a science writer and reporter before being lured into the less-charted territory of mythology and Earth spirituality. A reviewer says Monaghan's work \\"links science and poetry in a passionate tango.\\" At her home in Black Earth, Wisconsin, she and her husband, Michael McDermott, tended a vineyard, orchard, and large organic garden. She was also a wine expert,The Wine Connoisseur Online Magazine and author of Wineries of Minnesota and Wisconsin. At the time of her death, Monaghan had just finished co-editing with her spouse Dr. Michael McDermott an anthology of writings called Brigit: Sun of Womanhood. She was also revising The Encyclopedia of Goddesses and Heroines for a paperback edition. Both can be expected in 2013. Poetry Patricia Monaghan's four books of poetry share an emphasis on the book as more than a random collection of poems. Each centers on a specific theme. Her first book, Winterburning, explores the paradoxical connection between fire and ice in the arctic. Her second, Seasons of the Witch (winner of the Friends of Literature Award for poetry and the COVR award for best multimedia work), traces the seasons as metaphors for a woman's life; the poems have been set to music and recorded by Alaskan women artists and are available both within the book and separately. Dancing with Chaos uses the language and concepts of dynamical systems theory to examine human relationships. Homefront deals with the impact of war on families. Folk composer Michael Smith set a number of the poems to music, and they have been recorded by Jamie O'Reilly as Songs of the Kerry Madwoman. In early 2011, The Grace of Ancient Land, a chapbook, was published by the Voices from the American Land series. It uses the framework of the traditional Mass to express the power of rural life in America's heartland. A longer version of this work, together with poems set in Ireland and capturing the connection of nature, culture and spirituality there, was published by Salmon Poetry under the title Sanctuary. Organizational leadership Patricia Monaghan was a founder of and Senior Fellow at The Black Earth Institute.,Black Earth Institute Website an organization dedicated to inspiring artists to serve the causes of inclusive spirituality, protecting and healing the earth and fighting for social justice. She was also a leader in the founding and development of the Association for the Study of Women and Mythology, an organization committed to recognizing and encouraging Goddess scholarship in academia and Goddess- inspired creative arts. Honors and awards Monaghan won a Pushcart Prize (2003) for \\"Physics and Grief\\". Her work was also included in Best American Spiritual Writing that year.King, Barbara J.

Morris Canoe Company of Veazie, Maine from 1887 to 1920. As a child, Seliga's family owned two Morris canoes, a 15-foot and an 18-foot.

Seliga built his first canoe form and completed his first canoe in 1938, which he immediately sold. Seliga built canoes from before World War II until his death at the age of 94, only stopping from 1942 to 1945, when he was forced to work as a miner. He worked in the Zenith Mine and at Reserve Mining. Over his career, he built 621 canoes, 237 of which were sold to the YMCA and church camps which used the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and Quetico Provincial Park.

Born in Castlegar, County Galway, Connolly first played competitive hurling whilst at school in St. Mary's College, Galway. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he first linked up with the Galway minor team, before later joining the under-21 side. He made his senior debut in the 1976 championship. Connolly went on to play a key role for Galway for almost a decade, and won one All- Ireland medal. An All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions, Connolly captained Galway to the All-Ireland title in 1980. As a member of the Connacht inter- provincial team at various times, Connolly won two Railway Cup medals. At club level he is a one-time All-Ireland medallist with Castlegar. In addition to this he also won two Connacht medals and two championship medals. With University College Galway, Connolly won one Fitzgibbon Cup medal. Throughout his career Connolly made 22 championship appearances for Galway. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1984 championship. As the third eldest of the Connolly dynasty, many of his brothers, John, Pádraic, Michael, Tom, Gerry and Murt, played with distinction for Castlegar and Galway. His son, Barry Connolly, has lined out for the Dublin senior team. In retirement from playing, Connolly became involved in team management and coaching. He has served as a selector with the Galway senior team, while at club level he also served as manager of the Castlegar senior team. Playing career University During his tenure at University College Galway, Connolly was a key member of the university's senior hurling team. In 1977 he lined out at full-forward as UCG reached the final of the inter-varsities championship. A 1–14 to 1–12 defeat of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth gave him a Fitzgibbon Cup medal. He earned his B.A. from the university in 1978. Club Connolly joined the Castlegar senior hurling panel in 1974, however, the team were beaten in their quest for three championships in-a-row. In 1979 Connolly was a key member of the team as Castlegar reached the championship final. First-time finalists Kinvara faced an uphill battle against roll of honour leaders Castlegar. A 2–13 to 0–6 victory gave Connolly his first championship medal. Old rivals Tremane provided the opposition in the subsequent provincial decider, however, a 4–12 to 0–5 victory gave Connolly a third Connacht medal. Castlegar later became the first team from Connacht to qualify for the All-Ireland decider. Antrim and Ulster champions Ballycastle provided the opposition, as Connolly and his four brothers faced six Donnelly brothers on the opposing team. Olcan McLaverty scored a goal in the first half, however, this failed to ignite the Ballycastle attack. Five minutes into the second half Liam Mulryan turned a Connolly pass into the net to take the lead. Ballycastle cut this lead to just a point, however, two points from brothers Gerry and Joe Connolly set up a 1–11 to 1–8 victory and an All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship medal for Connolly. After losing back-to-back championship decider in 1982 and 1983, Castlegar were under pressure to deliver in 1984. A 3–10 to 0–11 victory over Killimordaly gave Connolly his second championship medal. Tooreen fell by 2–15 to 2–7 in the subsequent provincial final, giving Connolly a fourth Connacht medal. Castlegar later faced St. Martin's of Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider. Tom Moran scored two goals which seemed to put St. Martin's in the driving seat, however, a goal by Kilkenny man Martin O'Shea for Castlegar secured a draw. The replay saw Tom Moran take centre stage once again, as St. Martin's secured a 1–13 to 1–10 victory. Inter-county Connolly first came to prominence on the inter-county scene with the Galway minor and under-21 teams, however, he enjoyed little success in these grades. He made his senior championship debut on 18 July 1976 in a 3–12 to 3–9 All-Ireland quarter-final defeat of Kerry. After three years of penultimate stage defeats, Galway shocked four-in- a-row hopefuls Cork in the All-Ireland semi-final and qualified for an All- Ireland final showdown with Kilkenny in 1979. In one of the worst All-Ireland finals of the decade, Galway goalkeeper Séamus Shinnors had an absolute nightmare of a game. A 70-yards free by Liam \\"Chunky\\" O'Brien after just four minutes dipped, hit off Shinnors and ended up in the Galway net. Galway fought back and went two points up twelve minutes into the second half, however, they failed to score for the rest of the game. Four minutes before the end of the game another long-range free for Kilkenny ended up in the net behind Shinnors. It was a score which summed up the day for Connolly's side as Kilkenny went on to win by 2–12 to 1–8. In 1980 Connolly was appointed captain as Galway defeated Kildare and Offaly to reach a second consecutive All-Ireland final. Munster champions Limerick provided the opposition on this occasion and an exciting championship decider followed. Bernie Forde and P. J. Molloy goals for Galway meant that the men from the west led by 2–7 to 1–5 at half-time. Éamonn Cregan single-handedly launched the Limerick counter-attack in the second-half. Over the course of the game he scored 2–7, including an overhead goal and a point in which he showed the ball to full-back Conor Hayes and nonchalantly drove the ball over the bar. It was not enough to stem the tide and Galway went on to win the game by 2–15 to 3–9. It was the county's first All-Ireland title since 1923 and the celebrations surpassed anything ever seen in Croke Park. It took Connolly ten minutes to reach the rostrum in the Hogan Stand to collect the Liam MacCarthy Cup, however, once there he delivered, in his native Irish, one of the most famous acceptance speeches of all-time. > \\"People of Galway, after fifty-seven years the All-Ireland title is back in > Galway...It's wonderful to be from Galway on a day like today. There are > people back in Galway with wonder in their hearts, but also we must remember > (Galway) people in England, in America, and round the world and maybe they > are crying at this moment…People of Galway, we love you!\\" The final phrase is an echo of Pope John Paul II's address to the young people of Ireland the previous year. The celebrations didn't just end with Connolly's speech as Joe McDonagh seized the microphone and lead the crown in a version of the West's Awake. Connolly rounded of the year by collecting an All-Star award, as well as being named as the Texaco Hurler of the Year. 1981 saw Galway reach a third consecutive All-Ireland final and Offaly were the opponents. Everything seemed to be going well for Connolly's side as Galway hoped to capture a second consecutive All-Ireland title. Offaly 'keeper Damien Martin was doing great work in batting out an almost certain Galway goal early in the second-half. With twenty-three minutes left in the game Galway led by six points, however, they failed to score for the rest of the game. Johnny Flaherty hand-passed Offaly's second goal with just three minutes remaining. At the long whistle Galway were defeated by 2–12 to 0–15. The following few years proved difficult as Galway were knocked out of the championship at the All-Ireland semi-final stages in 1982 and 1983. Connolly retired from inter- county hurling following a serious knee injury in 1984. Inter-provincial Connolly also lined out with Connacht in the inter-provincial series of games and enjoyed much success. In 1979 Connolly was at centre-forward as Connacht reached the inter-provincial decider. A 1–13 to 1–9 defeat by Leinster was the result on that occasion. Connolly retained the same position on the team and was appointed captain in 1980 as Connacht faced Railway Cup specialists Munster in the decider. A low-scoring game followed, however, a 1–5 to 0–7 victory gave Connacht their first Railway Cup title since 1947. It was Connolly's first winners' medal in the inter-pro competition. Connacht reached the Railway Cup final again in 1982. A 3–8 to 2–9 victory over Leinster gave Connolly his second Railway Cup medal. Managerial career Galway In 2008 Connolly became a selector with the Galway senior hurling team, under the management of John McIntyre. The highlight of his three years as a selector was a 2–22 to 1–17 defeat of Cork in 2010 to take the National League title. Castlegar Connolly has also served as manager of the Castlegar senior hurling team. Broadcasting Connolly has served as a non-executive director of Irish language channel TG4 for a number of years. He has also worked as an analyst on Seó Spóirt and has co-hosted reality show Jockey Eile with Seán Bán Breathnach. Personal life Born in Castlegar on the outskirts of Galway, Connolly was educated at Briarhill national school and later attended St. Mary's College. After completing his Leaving Certificate in 1974, he completed a Bachelor of Arts in Irish and Geography at University College Galway, before later qualifying as a secondary school teacher in 1979. In spite of this he later worked as a sales director with Connolly Sports, a sportswear manufacturing company.

As such, it is a variety of the European continental civil law or ius commune. While Roman-Dutch law was superseded by Napoleonic codal law in the Netherlands proper as early as the beginning of the 19th century, the legal practices and principles of the Roman-Dutch system are still applied actively and passively by the courts in countries that were part of the Dutch colonial empire, or countries which are influenced by former Dutch colonies: Guyana, South Africa (and its neighbours Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Eswatini, and Zimbabwe), Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Surinam, and the formerly Indonesia-occupied East Timor. It also heavily influenced Scots law.John W. Cairns, “Importing our Lawyers from Holland: Netherlands Influences on Scots Law and Lawyers in the Eighteenth Century”, in Scotland and the Low Countries, 1124–1994, ed. G. G. Simpson (East Linton: Tuckwell, 1996), 136; reprinted in Law, Lawyers, and Humanism: Selected Essays on the History of Scots Law, vol. 1 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2015). It also had some minor impact on the laws of the American state of New York, especially in introducing the office of Prosecutor (schout-fiscaal). History  Roman law was progressively abandoned during the early Middle Ages. The Theodosian Code and excerpts of latter-day imperial enactments (constitutiones) were well known in the successor Germanic states and vital to maintaining the commonplace principle of folk-right which applied pre-existing Roman law to Roman provincials and Germanic law to Germans. The Breviary of Alaric and the Lex Gundobada Romana are two of the several hybrid Romano-Germanic law codes that incorporated much Roman legal material. However, because the fall of the Western Roman Empire preceded the drafting of the Justinianic Code, early Byzantine law was never influential in Western Europe. Also, much of this early law was superseded by later feudal law. Only canon law successfully retained any substantial amount of Roman law to be influential. Interest in the doctrines of Byzantine lawyers came when—around the year 1070—a copy of the Digest of Emperor Justinian I found its way into northern Italy. Scholars in the emerging University of Bologna, who previously had access to only a limited portion of the Justinianic code, sparked an intellectual rediscovery of Roman law through the teaching of law based on Byzantine law texts. Courts gradually applied Byzantine law—as taught in Bologna (and soon elsewhere)—first as law in subsidium to be applied when there was no local statute or custom in point, and later because judicial officers (judges, magistrates, assessors) felt that its refined legal concepts were more apt to solve complex cases than the customary laws of western and central Europe. This process, referred to as reception, took place in the Holy Roman Empire and the Mediterranean in the 13th-14th centuries, but was much slower to come to northern Europe (e.g., Saxony, Northern France, the Low Countries, Scandinavia). In the 15th century, reception in complexu reached the Netherlands while it was associated with the Holy Roman Empire. While Italian lawyers (mos italicus) were the first to contribute to the new Byzantine-based jurisprudence, in the 16th century, French humanistic doctrinal scholars (mos gallicus) were most influential. In the 17th and 18th century, it was the Dutch who had the greatest influence. Members of the Hollandse Elegante School (“school of elegant jurisprudence”; 1500–1800) included Hugo Grotius, Johannes Voet, Ulrich Huber, Gerard Noodt, J. and F. van de Sande, and many others. These scholars managed to merge Roman law with legal concepts taken from traditional Dutch feudal customary law, especially from the province of Holland. The resulting mixture was predominantly Roman, but it contained some features which were characteristically Dutch: this hybrid is known as Roman-Dutch law. The Dutch applied their legal system in their colonial empire. In so doing, the distinctly Dutch branch of civil law (or ius commune) came to be applied in far-flung places, e.g., the Dutch East Indies, Dutch West Indies, Cape Colony, and Dutch Ceylon. In the Netherlands, Roman-Dutch law abruptly ended when, in 1809, the Dutch puppet state—the Kingdom of Holland—adopted the French Napoleonic Code, a different system but nonetheless a branch of civil law. Yet, in the then-Dutch colonies, French law was never introduced during or after the Napoleonic era. As a result, Roman-Dutch law has managed to survive, usually in a hybrid form mixed with English law, otherwise known as “Anglo- Dutch law”. Today The influence nevertheless exists in the former Dutch- ruled areas in South America and heavily influenced former Dutch colonies like Sri Lanka(which uses a mix of common and civil law) and Guyana. Suriname is still governed under the Roman-Dutch legal system. On the other hand, in Guyana, the Roman-Dutch legal principles are still applied in a restricted way for governing properties within the country despite the enforcement of Civil Law of Guyana Ordinance in 1917 that favors the English style Common law system. Law reform in former Dutch colonies The Netherlands participated in international seminars and training programmes organised by international partner organisations, ranging from a two-day seminar to a two-week programme for different legal professionals around the world. Programmes have been developed for Surinam, Aruba, Sint Maarten and Indonesia. See also *South African law *Scots law Notes References * Govaert C.J.J. van den Bergh.

Plot summary The story starts in Sacramento in 1867. The Cascabels are a French family of circus artists who plan to return home after several years spent touring the United States. However, their savings are stolen, so the family cannot afford the ship fare. Instead, César Cascabel decides to travel overland, via Alaska and Bering Straits, through Siberia and Central Russia with their horse-drawn carriage, the Belle-Roulotte (the Fair Rambler). They expect to encounter no dangers along their intended route. On their way crossing the Alaskan border, with the help of native girl Kayette, they rescue a Russian political fugitive, count Narkine, whom they bring along so that he can see again his father in Russia. Count Narkine adopts Kayette as his daughter. While in Sitka, the group witnesses the transfer of Alaska to the United States. On their way from Port Clarence the travellers unfortunately end up on a floating iceberg that drifts in Arctic Ocean to the Lyakhovsky Islands. There they are captured by the natives. Other troubles, including political ones, occur but Cascabels manage to get through the Urals to Perm and then, easily, to France.

History and description Water Board Building The Water Board Building is triangular in shape, for its triangle-shaped plot of land, occupying the entire block formed by Randolph, Farmer, and Bates Streets. The building's site was originally part of East Grand Circus Park as designated in 1806. The site was rezoned in 1886, when part of the land became home to the Metropolitan Police Commission. The building is composed of a five-story base topped by 15 more floors of office space, and crowned with a three-story penthouse. It was originally planned to be only 14 floors in height, but because of the high land value of the site, the height was increased. The building was completed in seven months by a young A.Z. Shmina for A.W. Kutsche & Co.; upon its completion, the Water Commission only occupied the first eight floors of the building, with the other city departments filling up the remaining floors. The Water Board Commission became the sole tenant in the 1990s.Water Board Building. Detroit1701. Retrieved on January 3, 2014.

It is a beach resort district located around Lagoa Cove. It was mostly developed between the 1970s and the 1980s with high-rise buildings in the area of a dried-up saltwater lagoon, and it is the north expansion of the city's traditional beach district, Bairro Norte. Most of the highrise buildings of the city are clustered in this area, around Vasco da Gama avenue. The beachfront area was the location of a Roman fish factory complex, one of the buildings dated to the 1st century, the district only developed in the 20th century with the northwards expansion of Avenida dos Banhos and opening of Avenida Vasco da Gama. Early attractions include the horse track Velódromo in 1925, which later became Gomes de Amorim stadium, home of Sporting Club da Póvoa (1916-1940s), Varzim S.C. stadium in 1932, and the Póvoa de Varzim Bullfighting Arena in 1949. It became the sports center of Póvoa de Varzim for much of the 20th century. Urban morphology Lagoa Beach during low tide in mid-September. Agro-Velho is bounded by Bairro Norte on the south, Parque da Cidade on the east, A Ver-o-Mar to the North, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the west. It is located on the site of a former lagoon. The name of the district's beach, \\"Lagoa\\" (Lagoon in English) is taken from it. The district is the northwards expansion of Póvoa's traditional beach district, the Bairro Norte.Relatório do Plano de Urbanização da Póvoa de Varzim (in Portuguese) — CMPV, Departamento de Gestão Urbanística e Ambiente Beaches The district's main beach is Lagoa, in Lagoa Cove, there are others in the cove's flanks, such as Beijinhos and Verde Beach to the south and Fragosinho to the North. Lagoa has a surfing spot and the beachfront is, currently, mostly pedestrian and has beach bars. Main streets and squares Avenida Vasco da Gama, the south boundary with Bairro Norte, is one of the main central business avenues of the city. The wide Praça Almeida Garrett is the main district's square, but unofficial Touro Square, with its famous sculpture, between Vasco da Gama and Repatriamento dos Poveiros is the most charismatic and famous of the district's squares. In the waterfront, the district is bounded by Rua do Varzim Sport Club street, the street is now mostly pedestrian, and rua Gomes de Amorim (EN13 Highway) on the east, Avenida Repatriamento dos Poveiros and its expansion (Rua 27 de Fevereiro) cross the district. Venues Relevant sports venues of the city are located in the beachfront: the Varzim S.C. Stadium, Póvoa de Varzim Bullfighting area for bullfighting, horse shows and music concerts, Varzim Lazer swimming and tennis complex, and Clube Desportivo da Póvoa swimming and pavilion complex. City towers Póvoa de Varzim high-rises located on a plain are responsible for the city's distinct looks, contrasting with most other cities in Portugal. One of the earliest towers is \\"Edifício Norton de Matos\\" (circa 54 m, 16 floors), built in 1974 between Rua Gomes de Amorim and Avenida Vasco da Gama, most other towers soon followed. The latest is \\"Forte de São Pedro\\" with the same height and floors. The later one was built in 2002 when the city hall had already intentional plans to stop the construction of high-rises. Agro-Velho also has the tallest building in Póvoa de Varzim, the Edifício Nova Póvoa (ca. 90 m, 30 floors) built between 1974 - 1982. The tower has over 1,000 residents during the summer, this building alone has more inhabitants than several civil parishes in Portugal. Although it is not currently the tallest building, is still the residential building with more floors of Portugal Axis Vermar Hotel (ca.58 m, 15 floors) was designed by architect Rui Cesariny Calafate, and originally it is the Vermar Hotel (1974) created by Sopete, which previously owned Casino da Póvoa.

However, hepatic adenomas are usually asymptomatic, and may be discovered incidentally on imaging ordered for some unrelated reason. Large hepatic adenomas have a tendency to rupture and bleed massively inside the abdomen. If not treated, there is a 30% risk of bleeding. Bleeding may lead to hypotension, tachycardia, and sweating (diaphoresis). Related Conditions Hepatic adenomas are related to glycogen storage diseases, type 1, as well as anabolic steroid use. Diagnosis Hepatic adenoma is usually detected by imaging, typically an ultrasound or CT, as a hyperenhancing liver nodule. Given that several liver tumors appear similarly on these imaging modalities, a multi-phase contrast-enhanced imaging study such as CT or MRI may be used to provide more information. The significance of making a specific diagnosis is that, unlike other benign liver tumors such as hemangioma and focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatic adenomas have a small but meaningful risk of progressing into a malignancy. Although imaging provides supportive information, a definitive diagnosis of hepatic adenoma requires biopsy of the tissue.  Radiologic differential diagnosis  *Echinococcal cyst *Focal fatty change *Focal nodular hyperplasia *Hepatoblastoma *Infiltrative liver disease *Inflammatory pseudotumor *Leiomyosarcoma *Lymphoma *Nodular regenerative hyperplasia Subtypes Hepatic adenomas may be sub-classified according to morphologic appearance by microscopy, immunohistochemical staining, and genetic mutational analysis: * Inflammatory (40%–50%) * HNF1α-inactivated (35%–40%) * β-catenin–activated - with exon 3 versus exon 7/8 mutation * β-Catenin–activated inflammatory - with exon 3 versus exon 7/8 mutation * Unclassified Although the significance of this categorization is still under research, the subtypes may indicate differential risk of hemorrhage or malignant transformation. Pathologic diagnosis Micrograph of a hepatic adenoma demonstrating a regular reticulin scaffold. Reticulin stain Hepatic adenomas are, typically, well-circumscribed nodules that consist of sheets of hepatocytes with a bubbly vacuolated cytoplasm. The hepatocytes are on a regular reticulin scaffold and less or equal to three cell thick. The histologic diagnosis of hepatic adenomas can be aided by reticulin staining. In hepatic adenomas, the reticulin scaffold is preserved and hepatocytes do not form layers of four or more hepatocytes, as is seen in hepatocellular carcinoma. Cells resemble normal hepatocytes and are traversed by blood vessels but lack portal tracts or central veins. Image:Hepatic adenoma high mag.jpgMicrograph of hepatic adenoma. H&E; stain Image:Hepatic adenoma low mag reticulin.jpgMicrograph of hepatic adenoma. Reticulin stain Treatment Some authors feel that all hepatocellular adenoma should be resected, because of the risk of rupture causing bleeding and because they may contain malignant cells.Full text Current recommendations are that all hepatic adenomas should be resected, as long as they are surgically accessible and the patient is a reasonable operative candidate. Patients with adenomas should avoid oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy. Pregnancy could cause the adenoma to grow faster, so patients with hepatic adenomas should avoid pregnancy. Epidemiology Liver tumor types by relative incidence in adults in the United States, with hepatocellular adenoma at right.Table 37.2 in: The majority of hepatic adenomas arise in women aged 20–40, most of whom use oral contraceptives. Other medications which also alter circulating hormone levels, such as anabolic or androgenic steroids, Barbiturates, clomifene, have also been implicated as risk factors. Incidence of adenomas may be increased in metabolic diseases, including tyrosinemia and type 1 diabetes mellitus, and glycogen storage diseases (types 1 and 3), as well as in beta-thalassemia and hemochromatosis.

All programs provided at the university are accredited by The Nederlands-Vlaamse Accreditatieorganisatie (NVAO). History The University of Curaçao has existed in its present form since 1973. Its history, however, dates back to 1970, the year in which the Law College of the Netherlands Antilles was established by a national decree dated October 6, 1970 (O.B. 1970 no. 1130), to prepare students to take the LL.B. Antillean Law exam. The Law College became the College of the Netherlands Antilles in 1974, after a degree program in Business Administration was established. The Department of Business Administration was changed into the Department of Business Administration and Public Administration in 1977, after which students could also obtain a bachelor's degree in Public Administration. Finally, with the foundation of the UNA in 1979 by a national decree dated 12 January 1979 (O.B. 1979 no. 12), the Antillean College of Technology (established 1972), was transformed into the Faculty of Engineering.

Background and education Born Leifchild Stratten Jones on 16 January 1862 in St Pancras, London, the fifth of the six children of Thomas Jones (1819–1882), an Independent clergyman, formerly of Morriston, Swansea, and Jane Jones, daughter of John Jones of Dowlais. His older siblings were David Brynmor (b. 1851), Annie, John Viriamu (b. 1862) and Irvonwy; his younger brother was Morlais Glasfryn. His brothers David Brynmor Jones and John Viriamu Jones would both achieve prominence in public life. In 1867, when Leifchild was five years old, his mother died, and in 1869 his father left London, for health reasons, moving firstly back to Swansea (1870–1877) and afterwards to Melbourne, Australia (1877–1880), where Leifchild was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne, from 31 July 1877 to December 1878.Scotch College Admission Register No.2, Entry 2429 Afterwards Leifchild became a student at Trinity College, Oxford.thepeerage.com Leifchild Stratten Leif- Jones, 1st and last Baron Rhayader Member of Parliament and temperance campaigner From 1905 to January 1910 Leif Jones served as Member of Parliament for Appleby, in Cumbria.

In 1917 he was sworn of the Privy Council. From 1923 to 1924 and from 1929 to 1931 he served as Member for Camborne, in Cornwall. On 25 January 1932 Jones was elevated to the peerage as Baron Rhayader, of Rhayader in the County of Radnor. So that he might continue to be known by the familiar name of 'Leif Jones' he had earlier that month changed his surname by deed poll from 'Jones' to 'Leif-Jones'. Despite his long political career Leif Jones is best remembered as a temperance leader. He was President of the United Kingdom Alliance (UKA), the leading British prohibitionist organisation, between 1906 and 1932. He had earlier been private secretary to the Countess of Carlisle, a prominent prohibitionist campaigner.Entry on Leif Jones in Alcohol and Temperance in Modern History: Volume I. As a temperance campaigner Leif Jones was sometimes referred to as 'Tea-leaf Jones'. Lord Rhayader died in Marylebone, London, in September 1939, aged 77, when the barony became extinct.

History The urbanization of Bairro Norte started when, King John VI by the Royal Provision of November 14, 1825, confirmed the possession of the beaches north of the seaport wall to the fishermen of Póvoa . A priest called for a portion of the beach north of the seaport wall to the city hall in order to build a chapel dedicated to Saint Joseph. City Hall authorized the idea on September 16, 1837. In the 19th century was already a bustling fishing neighborhood, but it was already developing as a beach district. This development led to gentrification processes in the typical fisher streets of Bairro Norte such as Ramalhão and Norte streets during most of the 20th century.

It was shown on the channel Animal Planet, but recently, it has not been seen. Episodes have aired between 2001 and 2003. Summary The episodes are split into four parts. The first part often introduces the animal who is expecting, and her owners (or in some cases, handlers or even trainers), along with a bit of a backstory about the expectant mother (if she's had other children, if she's been in shows, if she's been in accidents, etc.). The rest of the first half and the entire second half are dedicated to the animal's owners/handlers/trainers getting prepared for the upcoming birth. The third part always features the mother giving birth, and the fourth part deals with what happens afterwards, with the baby animal (babies in some cases) bonding with their mother and the humans that look after them. There have been some episodes where the animal's young is stillborn, or doesn't survive the first few days (examples of this could be with the Thoroughbred mare, Whimsical Treasure, who loses her foal due to it being a breech birth). Other times the mother doesn't take very good care of her child, and it needs to be hand- reared (an example of this would be Betsy the giraffe, whose calf is taken from her when she wasn't able to nurse her properly).

It was founded as Tyee High School, a single public high school, in 1962. It is operated by the Highline School District. Starting in the 2005-06 academic year, it was split from a single school into three smaller high schools. In 2011 it was turned into two small schools now known as Academy of Citizenship and Empowerment and Global Connections High School as a part of the small schools movement. It is also a member of the Coalition of Essential Schools. History In 1963, Tyee High School was founded as a part of the Highline School District to serve an area between Burien and Des Moines in the west, and Tukwila in the east, which would later become the city of SeaTac. In 1993, one of Tyee's distinguished teachers was recognized by the state of Washington for building an observatory on school grounds, one of the few in the nation at the time, with the State's Golden Apple award. Small schools conversion In the years prior to the conversion, Tyee suffered from severe discipline and academic performance issues. New principal Max Silverman and the district's deputy superintendent, John Welch, knew that change was necessary and began to talk about how to improve the situation. In 2003, the school received a grant from the Discuren Foundation to begin research. Over the next several years, Silverman and Welch led the research, including traveling to other high schools across the nation to note what made such schools successful. This research led the staff to decide that a small schools approach was the best way to improve the school's standing. In the 2004–05 school year, the school instituted freshman \\"houses\\" intended to give incoming students more personalized instruction. The staff noted significant improvements, which support the idea of small, autonomous schools. In 2004, Tyee received a large grant from the Coalition of Essential Schools to be used in the conversion process. In addition, they, along with the district's other three schools, received a Department of Education Small Learning Community grant. In 2005 the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded a grant to the district, a significant portion of which went towards Tyee. Beginning in the 2005–06 school year, Tyee ceased to operate as a single comprehensive high school and was split into the three small schools, as noted above. However, it was still recognized by the state as a single school, and thus its graduates received Tyee High School diplomas, and WASL scores were reported only for Tyee as a whole. The schools first held individual graduation ceremonies in 2007. In the same year, WASL scores were reported individually for each school. Tyee returned to being one unified high school in the fall of 2017. https://www.highlineschools.org/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID;=33&ModuleInstanceID;=2205&ViewID;=6446EE88-D30C-497E-9316-3F8874B3E108&RenderLoc;=0&FlexDataID;=25257&PageID;=59&GroupByField;=&GroupYear;=0&GroupMonth;=0&Tag;=https://www.highlineschools.org/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID;=37&ModuleInstanceID;=11896&ViewID;=6446EE88-D30C-497E-9316-3F8874B3E108&RenderLoc;=0&FlexDataID;=22900&PageID;=67&GroupByField;=DisplayDate&GroupYear;=2016&GroupMonth;=11&Tag;= Famous alumni *Gary Ridgway, serial killer and necrophile, known to have killed at least 49 prostitutes and runaways in the Pacific Northwest.http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/special- reports/article25855195.htmlhttp://www.seattlepi.com/local/slideshow/Green- River-Killer-Gary-Ridgway-Photos-from-the-73393.php *Adam Smith (politician), Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives since 1997. *Steve Pool, weather anchor for KOMO-TV in Seattle. *Nic \\"Sentry\\" Cirlincione, professional pizza connoisseur, and Amazon representative since 2017. Enrollment In the years preceding the conversion, Tyee's enrollment was at just above 1200 students. As a condition of the Coalition of Essential Schools grant, the small schools were to each have no more than 400 students, resulting in the complex's total enrollment being closer to 1100. In the first two years of having small schools, students were not allowed to enroll in a specific school, instead being placed into one of the three depending on various factors. Beginning in the 2007-08 school year, students were allowed to enroll in the school of their choice. School facilities The complex's layout, with ACE portion in blue, Global in green, and Odyssey in red. Shared space is shaded grey. The complex consists of several small circular buildings, as well as two larger buildings. As Tyee initially existed as a single school, adjusting to three small schools has been difficult. The cafeteria (100), library (500), gymnasiums, locker rooms (part of 700 building), and clinic (900) are operated by the complex and are shared equally by all three schools. In addition, the 200 building, which contains science equipment which cannot easily be moved, is shared by the three schools; however, unlike the other buildings, each school is responsible for different rooms of the building. Other parts of the complex are occupied by individual schools. Global Connections occupies the 300 and 600 buildings on the east side of the complex. ACE occupies the classrooms of the 700 building, which excludes portions operated by the complex, such as the gymnasiums. Odyssey occupies the 800 building, a large building at the top of the hill on the western side of the complex. This building was once part of neighboring Chinook Middle School, but since the 1981-1982 school year has been used by Tyee, and eventually Odyssey. Levenhagen Observatory The Levenhagen Observatory is an astronomical observatory owned and operated by Tyee High School. It is named after Physics/Astronomy teacher Warren Levenhagen. Extracurricular activities Sports Athletics are one of the few areas in which all three schools remain combined, as it is unlikely that any of the individual schools would have the ability to field a full team in any event. The sports teams are called the Totems, after the traditional Native American totem poles. The complex as a whole fields varsity teams in football, cross country, soccer, volleyball, swimming, basketball, gymnastics, wrestling, baseball, fastpitch, tennis, and track and field. Football currently co-ops to Mount Rainier and play as the Rams.http://waterlandblog.com/2016/11/05/mount- rainier-rams-football-team-loses-first-round-of-playoffs-to-skyline-friday/ Tyee's sports teams are members of the Sound Division of the South Puget Sound League (2A) as of the 2016-17 school year.http://www.spslathletics.com/index.php?district=3&league;=18 Tyee has earned three state championships in its history, in cross country in 1975 and 1976, and girls' soccer in 1984.

The winner of the previous rounds in the game had to choose a Ford car key, numbered from 1 to 10.

Breeding Azeri was bred and owned by Allen E. Paulson, who named her for an aviation checkpoint in Baku, Azerbaijan.National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame Retrieved 2011-07-31. She was sired by Jade Hunter (winner of the Grade 1 Donn Handicap and the G1 Gulfstream Park Handicap), who was a son of Mr. Prospector. Azeri is the only starter out of the Ahonoora mare Zodiac Miss, who was bred in Australia by John Messara's Arrowfield Stud.Azeri's five-generation pedigree and race record Retrieved 2011-07-31. She is a descendant of the family of 1999 Breeders' Cup Mile winner Silic (FR). Australian bloodstock agents Brian King and James Bester (with California-based agent Denny Boultinghouse) recommended Zodiac Miss to Paulson, and the filly was shipped to US to race for her new owner. At the end of her racing career, Paulson sent Zodiac Miss to the breeding shed. Paulson was an aerospace magnate (Gulfstream Aerospace) whose global investments included racehorses, casinos, and oil exploration. He also bred and raced Cigar (Horse of the Year in 1995 and 1996), who ranks #2 on the North American all-time money-earners' list. Azeri was a buyback for $110,000 at the 1999 Keeneland September yearling sale from the consignment of Jonabell Farm. Racing career Azeri was originally trained by Simon Bray before Allen Paulson's son Michael (whose father died in 2000) transferred her to trainer Laura de Seroux in August 2001. Of Azeri, Seroux said, \\"She didn't let anyone down, and she did it in great style. She's simply the fastest filly in the world now. You can't catch her early, and you can't catch her late.\\" She won her first race (a six-furlong maiden race late in her three-year-old season) at Santa Anita on November 1, 2001, in the good time of 1:08. Injury and trainer change After an 11-race winning streak, Azeri suffered a tendon injury while going for her 12th straight win in the Lady's Secret Breeders' Cup Handicap at Santa Anita. She finished second, but the injury was career-threatening. Laura de Seroux recommended that she be retired, but Michael Paulson decided she could race again and turned her training over to Hall of Famer D. Wayne Lukas. In her first start for Lukas, six months after her injury, Azeri won an unprecedented third consecutive Apple Blossom Handicap. She then lost three races in a row, including the Metropolitan Mile, in which she raced against colts for the first time. Lukas entered her in the Go For Wand Handicap at Saratoga Race Course, where she faced multiple-Grade 1 winner Sightseek, beating that rival by two lengths. Azeri was an early favorite for the 2004 Breeders' Cup Distaff, but her handlers entered her in the Breeders' Cup Classic, where she faced male horses for the second time.Beth Harris, \\"Azeri has no shot in Classic, rival trainer Frankel says\\" USA Today, October 28, 2004 Retrieved 2011-07-31. She finished fifth behind Ghostzapper. Azeri was retired from racing in December 2004. In 24 starts, she won 17 races, finished second four times, and was unplaced three times. When Azeri was awarded the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year, she was the third female to win since voting began in 1971 (the other two female winners of HOY were All Along in 1983 and Lady's Secret in 1986; both fillies defeated males in their HOY campaigns, but Azeri did not run against males until 2004). She was also named Champion Older Filly or Mare from 2002 to 2004. In 2005, the Oaklawn Breeders' Cup Stakes at Arkansas's Oaklawn Park was renamed the Azeri Stakes in her honor. As a broodmare Michael Paulson retired Azeri in December 2004. Azeri originally stood at Hill 'n' Dale Farms in Lexington, Kentucky with other leading broodmares, including Silverbulletday and Better Than Honour (the dam of Belmont Stakes winners Jazil and Rags to Riches). Azeri was sold to Japanese owners in fall 2009 and, as of 2011, resides at Japan's Northern Farm. In her first breeding season in 2005 she was barren to Storm Cat, but she has since produced the following offspring: * Take Control, a colt by A.P.

He received a Bachelor of Science in Management from Post University in 1983. He then earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Bridgeport Law School in 1987.  Career  After graduating from law school, Jarjura worked as an independent attorney and businessman. He also served as an assistant Connecticut Attorney General from 1987 to 1993.  Colorado House of Representatives  Prior to his election as mayor, Jarjura served in the Connecticut House of Representatives representing the 74th District in the city's east end. He served as House Chairman of the Insurance and Real Estate Committee. He also served on the Judiciary and Finance Committee. During his tenure, Representative Jarjura served as Chairman and member of various Legislative Task Forces and Commissions.  Mayor of Waterbury  Jarjura was first elected mayor in 2001, and re-elected in 2003. In 2005, he was elected to a third term as a write-in candidate after losing the Democratic primary. He was re-elected in 2007 and 2009 as the Democratic Party nominee. In 2011, after failing to seek the Democratic nomination, he ran for reelection on the Republican Party ticket. In the general election, he was defeated by former police chief Neil O'Leary, who was the Democratic nominee. Perennial Waterbury mayoral candidate Larry DePillo also ran in the general election, as an independent.  Political positions  Jarjura is a cultural conservative who opposes abortion rights. He is a member of the Legislative Advisory Council of the Family Institute of Connecticut, an organization known for its vocal opposition to same-sex marriage. Jarjura, long considered a conservative Democrat, joined the Republican party in 2011. In 2006, he endorsed the independent senate campaign of Joe Lieberman. In 2008, he announced he would hire former Governor John G. Rowland, who had served prison time on a corruption charge, as an economic development advisor. In September 2009, Jarjura spoke at a Tea Party rally in Waterbury, saying, \\"We needed a spark, and you're the spark that is going to be the change. So don't give up.

His opponent, Kevin Lembo, won the endorsement of the Democratic State Convention later that month. In July 2010, Jarjura challenged his opponent's request for public funding in a complaint with the Connecticut State Election Enforcement Commission. The commission found no wrongdoing and approved the public grant. Later in July, Jarjura filed a lawsuit against the State Election Enforcement Commission for approving his primary opponent for public campaign financing. On July 27, Hartford Superior Court Judge James T. Graham denied Jarjura’s request for an injunction against the state and his opponent. In the state Democratic primary, held on August 10, 2010, Jarjura was defeated by Lembo.  References   External links  * About Mayor Michael J.

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is approximately east of Barnsley, west of Doncaster and north of Rotherham. Bolton upon Dearne was an ancient parish. It was recorded in the Domesday Book as part of the Manor of Bolton-upon-Dearne with Goldthorpe which was owned by Roger de Busli. In the early 18th century Barnsley attorney William Henry Marsden Esquire of Burntwood Hall bought the Manor of Bolton on Dearne with Goldthorpe with over 1,000 acres (4 km2) of land for £10,000. Bolton upon Dearne and Goldthorpe are recorded in the 1761–1767 Inclosure Awards. The Marsden family continued to hold the manor until 1815. Bolton upon Dearne became part of Doncaster Rural District under the Local Government Act 1894 until 1899, when it became a separate urban district. Bolton upon Dearne Urban District was abolished in 1937 under a County Review Order, becoming part of the large Dearne Urban District, along with Thurnscoe and part of Barnburgh parish. At the 2011 Census the village in the Dearne South Ward of the Barnsley Metropolitan Council had a population of 6,744. The village is served by Bolton-on-Dearne railway station. There are three primary schools in the village: Carrfield School, Heather Garth Primary School and Lacewood. The main secondary school in the area is Dearne Advanced Learning Centre, which caters for around 1,200 pupils aged 11 to 16 years. The Church of St Andrew the Apostle is on the corner of High Street and Angel Street. It was a 10th- century church with alterations made throughout the centuries. There is a Methodist Church on Furlong Road founded in 1832. There was a Roman Catholic church on Station Road, but this closed in the late 1980s, and became an electrical goods shop.

Album Over the winter of 2005, Dienel recorded Wind-Up Canary in a farmhouse in Leominster, Massachusetts with friends from her time at the New England Conservatory of Music and a piano borrowed from a nearby hotel lobby. Dienel is accompanied on the album by Peter Bitenc, Ben MacDonald, Christopher MacDonald, Juliet Nelson, Mike Olson, Rachael Price, Djim Reynolds, and Michael Winograd. According to the liner notes, it is \\"dedicated to the eccentrics, the non-believers, the hope-seekers, the meek-and-the-mild, the downtrodden, and the relentless dreamers everywhere. You're not the only canaries out amongst the world, so please keep singing.\\" Dienel, then 20, released the album in 2006 with Hush Records.

Packer, whose short stories share an oddball sensibility and heart-rent humor with Dienel's story songs.\\" Reception The album received favorable reviews. In Pitchfork, the album received a 7.6 rating on the site's 10-point scale and AllMusic gave the album four of five stars, with reviewer Stewart Mason calling the album \\"a compelling, highly enjoyable debut\\" and describing Dienel as having \\"a sparkling personality all her own\\" as well as being \\"an impressively strong melodicist.\\" PopMatters gave the album seven out of ten stars; reviewer Dave Heaton said the \\"debut album should get widely recognized for how fresh and how unlike everything else the music is.

Santo André is an area surrounding Cape Santo André in the Portuguese municipality of Póvoa de Varzim, whose territory runs along the northern shoreline of the parish of A Ver-o-Mar (also known as Quião) and south shoreline of Aguçadoura. It is an ancient fishing colony of Póvoa de Varzim. The A Ver-o-mar part was integrated in the city, given that it is urbanely continuous. Santo André keeps an unchanged fishing character identified by family homes that have grown up in a spontaneous way. Near Cape Santo André, there is a rocky formation known as Penedo do Santo (Saint's Rock), which has a mark that the Povoan fishermen believe to be a footprint of Saint Andrew (Portuguese: Santo André). The site is a relevant archaeological site, with evidences of Romanization and Stone Age paintings to Póvoa de Varzim and of ancient religious and cultural importance to Povoans. The Santo André Chapel was built in the 16th century. In Povoan Mythology, Saint Andrew is the Boatman of Souls and that he frees the souls of those whom drown in the sea, fishing them from the depths of the ocean after a shipwreck.

It has supported the party for over two decades though has disagreed with ACT policy on issues such as alcohol and drug restrictions. Its president is Felix Poole. In 2020, a number of Young ACT members resigned over an alleged culture of sexual harassment within the group, and an independent investigation into the claims is ongoing.  Creation and names  The youth division of the ACT Party was formed in 1996 at Victoria University of Wellington. The group was called \\"Prebble's Rebels\\" after the party's then- leader Richard Prebble. The name of the group changed several times: it changed to \\"ACTivists\\" in 2000, later became \\"ACT on Campus\\", then most recently became 'Young ACT'. The group has also had the nickname \\"Killer Bees\\", derived from their yellow T-shirts.  Present status  As of March 2020, Young ACT has clubs at University of Auckland and Victoria University of Wellington. The party reports that it is led by a national executive of four people.  Relationship with the ACT Party  Young ACT is not an official youth wing of the ACT Party. It has been described as an affiliated group and as a group \\"separate from ACT\\", one that is not under the party's control but is allowed to use the party’s logo and name so long as it \\"doesn't bring the party into disrepute\\". ACT Party leader Seymour said that this means ACT’s oversight and pastoral care responsibilities were limited. According to Young ACT's website as of February 2020, \\"Young ACT operates independently from the ACT party. While Young ACT may support the ACT party nothing on this site is indicative of the ACT party’s beliefs or opinions.\\"  Support and connections  Young ACT members have supported the ACT party in its campaigning. Members accompanied party candidate John Banks throughout his campaign in the 2011 general election, after which David Seymour said that the youth supporters were proof that the party could survive. Young ACT also created the Facebook page \\"David Seymour Memes For Over-taxed Liberal Teens\\" which posted about ACT events during the 2017 campaign. Members of Young ACT have also been involved directly with ACT. These have included: * David Seymour: the chairman and president of the youth group while studying at Auckland University became ACT's leader in 2014 and was elected to Parliament. * Hayden Fitzgerald: Fitzgerald was president of the youth group and an ACT Party Board member at the same time. * Peter McCaffrey: the president of the youth group during 2011 also stood for ACT in the 2008 general election for the Otaki electorate. * Myah Deedman: the former secretary of Young ACT will stand for ACT in the 2020 general election for the Hamilton East electorate. * James McDowall: a member of the youth group from 2005–2011, McDowall was heavily involved in the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill campaign, and is now an ACT board member and was elected to parliament in the . In a 2013 interview, the youth group's president called the relationship \\"solid\\".  Disagreements  The group was told off by the ACT Party in 1996 after vandalising a Labour candidate's billboards. When then-leader and sole ACT MP John Banks decided to vote against keeping the drinking age at 18, its president said the decision was \\"shortsighted, and goes against the ACT Party principles of choice and personal responsibility\\". The group said they would pull support at the next election campaign if he did not vote to keep the drinking age at 18. Young ACT also disagreed with the ACT Party on the GCSB Bill and the Telecommunications (Interception Capability and Security) or \\"TICS\\" Bill. John Banks supported the bills, while the youth group's vice president wrote an editorial in Critic expressing the group's opposition. In March 2020, ACT Party leader David Seymour threatened to strip Young ACT of their name, following plans by Young ACT to sell drug paraphernalia at an event to promote its drug policy. Whereas Young ACT seeks legalisation of several drugs, Seymour said that Young ACT's policy is not something \\"you'll see anytime soon\\" and that legalising drugs is \\"not a political priority\\" for him. Seymour said that if the group goes too far \\"we'll take away the name\\". Young ACT president Felix Poole said that they had not told the ACT Party about their plans as \\"we don't consult them on stunts like this\\". Young ACT did display drug paraphernalia at the group's stall, none of which were illegal items. Seymour visited the stall, and said that members of Young Act had not broken the law and would remain Act members.  Campaigns   Keep It 18 – Liquor laws  Young ACT was part of a campaign called Keep It 18. This was a joint campaign that sought to keep the drinking age at 18 and saw the group join with youth groups from three other parties. The campaign began in 2006 to oppose the Sale of Liquor (Youth Alcohol Harm Reduction: Purchase Age) Amendment Bill. According to a press release from the group, it circulated a banner to campuses around the country that was \\"signed by hundreds of students and young people who oppose efforts to raise the drinking age.\\" It also opposed the Alcohol Reform Bill that was introduced in 2010. Keep It 18's opposition to the Alcohol Reform Bill included a submission to Parliament. In both cases, the drinking age remained at 18.  Legalisation of drugs  Young ACT opposed making the party pill BZP illegal, which done in 2008. In the month before the ban came into effect, members sold party pills for $1 each to Auckland University students if they joined the organisation. The group said that around 500 members joined during the promotion. The move was called \\"grossly irresponsible\\" by Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton. ACT Party president Garry Mallet said that it was not the best way to \\"win the battle for freedom\\" and that he would talk to the group. In 2020, Young ACT released a policy which supported the legalisation of all drugs in New Zealand. The policy proposed that all drugs be legalised and regulated to varying degrees according to how harmful they are. For example, cannabis, LSD, and other low-risk drugs would be regulated in a framework similar to that of alcohol, whereas more serious drugs like heroin and methamphetamine would be regulated in a prescription model similar to that of Switzerland.  Voluntary student membership  Young ACT supported the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill. The bill made membership of student associations voluntary; it was a private member's bill by ACT MP Roger Douglas and was supported by the National Party. Young ACT members arranged for about 60 members and friends to attend a meeting of the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association in October 2009 to have the association support the bill. Young ACT president Peter McCaffrey said that the meeting voted in favour of the bill, but the association Executive declared that the meeting was invalid and was struck from the records. The group faced criticism when it posted a quote that compared compulsory union membership to gang rape. McCaffrey said there were no plans to delete the post, and ACT member Heather Roy said she would not ask the group to do so. However, the post was later removed. A few months later, a member of the youth group, Cameron Browne, told the Auckland University Students' Association treasurer to \\"get raped\\" in a Facebook conversation. McCaffrey said Browne should have \\"chosen a different swear word or called her something else\\" and that Browne had apologised on Facebook, but said that the screenshot of the conversation had been cut and hid the treasurer's remarks. The Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment bill received royal assent on 30 September 2011 and came into force on 1 January 2012.  Marriage equality  ACT on Campus supported the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013 which allowed same-sex couples to marry. The group issued a joint statement with four other groups in 2012, urging their MPs to support the bill.  Tobacco and vaping  According to its website, Young ACT \\"has opposed increases in tobacco tax year after year\\". Young ACT opposes regulations on vaping.  Opposition of Earth Hour  The group opposed Earth Hour in 2010. In a TV interview, president Rick Giles said electricity would be needed in any coming apocalyptic event and promoted Edison Hour as a celebration of technology.  University rent strike  Young ACT supported a rent strike, where students were refusing to pay a weekly fee for rooms they were unable to occupy due to COVID-19 restrictions.  Other promotions  Young ACT have handed out free condoms printed with slogans such as \\"screw Labour, vote ACT\\" and have handed out KFC Double Downs saying the burger is \\"a symbol of the freedom of choice all New Zealanders should enjoy\\".  Sexual harassment  In May 2020, the vice president of Young ACT, Ali Gammeter, resigned the position, saying that \\"for months I have been sexually harassed, slutshamed, and ignored\\" and that she was \\"not the only victim of this behaviour in our ranks\\". She said that the majority of women in Young ACT had experienced some form of sexual harassment from other members. The day after Gammeter's announcement Young ACT published a statement on its Facebook page which said that \\"prevalent and systematic incidents of harm have occurred within [the] organisation\\" and that there had been \\"justified criticism surrounding how our members and those using our platforms interact with each other.\\" The statement said that the group had \\"removed a number of the members in question\\", that it had created an equity committee, and that it would investigate reports of sexism and harassment. The ACT Party has also said it was considering investigating and offered to \\"provid[e] Ms Gammeter with any support she requires\\". When approached for comment, National President Felix Poole declined to be interviewed but said that the youth wing had asked Gammeter to create a sexual harassment and bullying policy after she complained about being sexually harassed by members of the group earlier in 2020. Between Gammeter's resignation and July 2020, three more main members publicly resigned from the group, citing experiences of alleged sexual assault and harassment and a toxic culture. One resigning member said \\"it is hard to find the words to describe the environment the Young ACT executive has created for victims\\"; another, who was a member of the newly formed equity committee, said \\"The issue with having an equity document is that it’s useless if you’re not going to enforce it.\\" Newsroom reviewed a collection of online messages and posts from pages affiliated with Young ACT and said: \\"The messages are sexually explicit, and are not appropriate for publication. They include jokes about sexual assault, including rape, and sexual harassment.\\" An independent investigation into Gammeter's claims is being conducted by an employment lawyer. it was \\"expected in coming weeks\\" and ACT Party leader David Seymour said he expected that an anonymised summary of the report would be publicly released, despite Gammeter having requested that the party does not publish any part of the report.

It sits on the border of Chicago and Riverdale, Illinois. The residents are 97% African-American according to the 2000 United States Census. Built between 1944 and 1945 with 1,498 units, the development consists primarily of two- story row houses spread over . History Altgeld Gardens was built by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to satisfy the need for improved housing for African American veterans returning from World War II. In 1956, the project was transferred to the Chicago Housing Authority. Located in an industrial area on Chicago's far South side, Altgeld was named after John Peter Altgeld, an Illinois governor in the 1890s. As one of the first public housing developments ever built in the United States, it is eligible to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In the early 21st century, 3,400 residents live in the Altgeld / Murray complex. This complex includes public schools within its borders, and the Housing Authority has maintenance staff, on-site social services, and medical facilities for residents. Altgeld Gardens' northern boundary is 130th Street, its southern boundary is 134th Street, the eastern boundary is the campus of George Washington Carver Military Academy (formerly known as George Washington Carver Area High School) a public 4-year public high school and the Beaubien Woods Forest Preserve of Cook County. Altgeld Gardens is regarded as the birthplace of the environmental justice movement. Toxic Donut Altgeld Gardens was nicknamed Chicago's 'toxic donut' due to having the highest concentration of hazardous waste sites in the United States. There were 50 landfills and 382 industrial facilities surrounding the area, including the Acme Steel plant and the Pullman factory, with many of the sites unregulated. There were also 250 leaking underground storage tanks. The sites surrounded rivers and lakes, making the water quality toxic for human consumption and recreation. Toxicology studies revealed high and dangerous levels of lead, mercury, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heavy metals, and xylene. Residents were exposed to hazardous fumes from nearby factories and asbestos in construction material for tile and insulation. The drinking water was contaminated and had the highest cancer rate in Chicago. These factors contributed to health burdens in the community through water and air pollution, including asthma and respiratory illness. There was a chemical odor in the air that stung residents' noses. The water had a light bronze color and came through the water pipes with little to no pressure. A survey found that 51% of pregnancies in 1992 reported birth abnormalities. People for Community Recovery In 1979, Hazel M. Johnson, a resident of Altgeld Gardens, mobilized community members to speak up against the environmental injustices and environmental racism her community faced and created the People for Community Recovery. The level of conflict and mobilization peaked in the 1980s and 1990s, where one of their first environmental victories was successfully lobbying the city and state to install water lines and sewer lines for Maryland Manor, home to many senior citizens. The residents of Maryland Manor were paying city taxes for 25 years for contaminated water extracted from wells where a film of chemicals such as cyanide floated on top. In 1980, the People for Community Recovery organized a grassroots campaign in the project to advocate for the removal of fiberglass and asbestos insulation from the complex flats. Former US President Barack Obama participated in this campaign during his early years as a local community organizer and wrote about his experience in Dreams From My Father. The People for Community Recovery continued to protest to improve the conditions of their community. The group successfully made companies accountable to clean up the pollution they created on the environment. A company that once utilized electrical transformers had to clean up oil the machinery burned. Operators of the Pullman Company railroad cars had to properly dispose sludge waste from former operations. The organization also trained Chicago Housing Authority workers focusing on the Altgeld Gardens' development on environmental lead dust reduction during the apartment's renovation period in 2002. The People for Community Recovery began to see improvements in their environment, although there were still issues that needed to be addressed. The work of Hazel Johnson and the People for Community Recovery influenced President Clinton to sign Executive Order 12898 which called for the Environmental Protection Agency to incorporate environmental justice principles into their work so that no groups of people may be disproportionately burdened by the consequences of pollution. Existing conditions Altgeld Gardens is a 99% minority public housing community hosting 8,000 community members, 90% of which are black and 63% of which are living below the poverty line. There is the highest percentage of people living in poverty and the lowest per capita income in the city. Numerous manufacturing plants, steel mills, landfills, and waste dumps border the 190 acre Altgeld Gardens site. The residents have a growing concern about the number of deaths annually from cancer and other diseases that may be related to environmental hazards of their industrial neighborhood. The community's status as low-income and minority gives them less political clout that enables toxic conditions to thrive. However, community organizing such as through the People for Community Recovery is making positive steps towards environmental justice. According to Cheryl Johnson, the head of People for Community Recovery, health problems of the Altgeld Gardens community include lead poisoning, asthma, bronchitis, and other respiratory diseases. Although most of the lead contamination stemmed from lead-based paint, there is lead contamination in the soil. In 2013, the 55th Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel eliminated the city's Department of Environment due to budgetary concerns. This provides less government help toward alleviating environmental burdens on communities, particularly communities of color. Therefore, the People for Community Recovery are still actively organizing to clean up their neighborhood for healthier living conditions. For example, the organization started programs and workshops to teach community members on lead poisoning prevention to share with their friends and neighbors. One topic discusses nutrition, as fatty foods can increase the absorption rate of lead in children's blood. Community Air Management Program Starting in August 2017, the Altgeld Gardens community began a community air management program to record toxic air levels in the area to influence government to make policy changes. Data recorded will help inform residents to make decisions about community mobilization and influence policy change, especially when lack of government funding prevents government entities from doing so. Solar and Green Jobs In May 2018, the Chicago Housing Authority signed a $145,000 contract to develop and implement a solar and energy efficiency training curriculum for residents to promote entrepreneurship and self-sufficiency. In October of the same year, the city of Chicago called for developers to construct a solar farm on a brownfield next to the community. This project is part of a city initiative to build ground-mounted solar farms on 30 acres of brownfield land on several sites across the city to work toward 100% renewable energy power for public housing The Future Energy Jobs Act will provide money and resources to this project, as part of the Act's allocation of $750 million funds programs that provide training for new energy jobs, such as solar installers and efficiency auditors. The implementation of solar and green jobs stemmed from the organizing work of the People for Community Recovery. The organization hopes to decrease unemployment rates, as the unemployment rate for Riverdale is five times the citywide average. Community members that are employed commute over an hour per trip. Providing jobs nearby the community will cut commute times and increase employment rates. Issues In 2017, President Donald Trump's administration proposed a 31% budget cut for the Environmental Protection Agency, which would lay off 19% of the current workforce. Without proper funding, the EPA cannot fund programs aimed to lower carbon emissions to reduce the impact on climate change and protect air and water quality. Programs aimed to clean up regional pollution such as Lake Michigan bordering Chicago would lose an estimated $427 million for spending. Superfund site program funding would drop from $762 million to $330 million. The EPA's enforcement division would also see a 31% cut, rendering a loss for environmental justice pursuits as the enforcement division has the power to fine companies that pollute. In addition to budget cuts, Head of the EPA Scott Pruitt has proposed to remove the environmental justice program within the EPA. Without the help of the EPA, the community is left to collect data to show proof of health burdens and the need for policy change. On December 19, 2018, the Federal Lead Action Plan was unveiled that provides a model for reducing childhood lead exposures. The Plan is under the President's Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children, which was issued by President Clinton through Executive Order 13045 in April 1997 There is an emphasis on childhood health due to the neurological, immunological, and digestive development during these critical years. Exposure to lead can have long-term consequences, and children have high risks of exposure. Minority children, in particular, are disproportionately burdened of lead exposures. The goals are to: *Goal 1: Reduce Children's Exposure to Lead Sources *Goal 2: Identify Lead-Exposure Children and Improve Their Health Outcomes *Goal 3: Communicate More Effectively with Stakeholders *Goal 4: Support and Conduct Critical Research to Inform Efforts to Reduce Lead Exposures and Related Health Risks However, experts on childhood lead exposure point out the Plan's failure to fully commit to the elimination of lead poisoning, provide concrete timelines, improve federal standards and regulations to speed up intervention times, specify which environmental groups and public health advocates they will gather input from, and specify where the funding comes from In fact, the word \\"eliminate\\" fails to appear in the action plan report compared to the task force's 2016 report, which included primary prevention, environmental justice, and the elimination of lead poisoning. Experts also point out that the 2018 Plan calls to re-evaluate lead contamination reports that have already been studied rather than collect data from new areas. Specification and commitment from the Plan and its operators will improve childhood lead exposure.

NPF provides information and services to help people take control of their condition, while supporting research to find a cure. In addition to serving more than 3 million people annually through patient and professional health education and advocacy initiatives, the National Psoriasis Foundation has funded more than $12 million in psoriatic disease research grants and fellowships. About the organization The National Psoriasis Foundation focuses on improving the health of people with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Through the organization's work to increase research, improve access to care, and expand knowledge of psoriatic disease, NPF aims to: * Reduce or eliminate disease symptoms because patients are on the right treatments * Lower an individual's risk of developing illnesses related to psoriatic disease by promoting good disease management and healthy behaviors * Ease the negative impact psoriatic disease has on the personal life, career and finances of those affected by making psoriatic disease more widely understood Strategic plan The National Psoriasis Foundation launched an aggressive five-year strategic plan, ending June 30, 2019, to: * Accelerate psoriatic disease research by investing at least 30 percent of its budget on scientific grants and fellowships; doubling the number of NIH-funded scientists studying psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis; gathering a group of 1,000 people with psoriatic disease to collaborate on research; and evaluating the progress of psoriatic disease research toward the goal of a cure. * Improve the health of people with psoriatic disease by doubling the number of people who are receiving appropriate treatment; cutting in half the number of people who report that psoriatic disease is a problem in everyday life; and doubling the number of health care providers effectively managing patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. * Conduct the largest and most comprehensive realignment and expansion of its psoriatic arthritis program — including reducing the time of diagnosis from four years to one — since NPF began serving this patient population. Research The National Psoriasis Foundation works to increase the number of dollars, scientists and quality research projects devoted to psoriatic disease to find better treatments and a cure. Each year, the National Psoriasis Foundation awards Discovery Grants and Translational Grants to support the start-up of new and innovative studies. NPF Discovery Grants are one-year awards up to $75,000 that fund researchers to explore preliminary ideas and conduct proof-of-concept experiments. The goal is to stimulate the development of new research programs in the field of psoriatic disease that are capable of competing for long-term funding from the National Institutes of Health or other agencies in the future. Funded research areas include, but are not limited to, genetics, cell biology, immunology and epidemiology/health services. NPF Translational Grants' are two-year awards up to $200,000 total that are focused on moving scientific discoveries generated during laboratory or clinical research into projects that clearly benefit patients. In 2015, the National Psoriasis Foundation and the Arthritis National Research Foundation collaborated for a special Psoriatic Arthritis Research Grant. To address the shortage of clinicians with in-depth knowledge of psoriatic disease, the National Psoriasis Foundation awards annual Medical Dermatology Fellowships. The fellowships, one-year awards up to $50,000, aim to increase the number of scientists focused on studying and treating psoriatic disease by encouraging young scientists to become physician researchers and dedicate their careers to psoriatic disease. The 'National Psoriasis Victor Henschel BioBank is a collection of biological samples and clinical information used by qualified scientists to advance the field of psoriasis genetics. It is one of the largest collections of psoriasis DNA samples in the United States.

The Battle of Assandun (or Essendune) was fought between Danish and English armies on 18 October 1016. There is disagreement whether Assandun may be Ashdon near Saffron Walden in north Essex or, as long supposed, Ashingdon near Rochford in southeast Essex, England. It ended in victory for the Danes, led by Canute the Great, who triumphed over the English army led by King Edmund Ironside. The battle was the conclusion to the Danish reconquest of England. Battle During the battle, Eadric Streona, the Ealderman of Mercia, left the battle allowing the Scandinavians to break through the English lines and win a decisive victory. Eadric Streona had previously defected to Canute when he landed in England but after Canute's defeat at the Battle of Otford he came back to the English, but this was a trick as he would betray them at Assandun. The battle is mentioned briefly in Knýtlinga saga which quotes a verse of skaldic poetry by Óttarr svarti, one of Canute's court poets. During the course of the battle, Eadnoth the Younger, Bishop of Dorchester, was killed by Canute's men whilst in the act of saying mass on behalf of Edmund Ironside's men. According to Liber Eliensis, Eadnoth's hand was first cut off for a ring, and then his body cut to pieces.Fairweather, Janet, trans., Liber Eliensis (Woodbridge, 2005), p. 169 The Ealdorman Ulfcytel Snillingr also died in the battle. Aftermath Following his defeat, Edmund was forced to sign a treaty with Canute. By this treaty, all of England except Wessex would be controlled by Canute and when one of the kings should die the other would take all of England, that king's son being the heir to the throne. After Edmund's death on 30 November, Canute built a church, chapel, or holy site after winning the battle to commemorate the soldiers who died in battle. A few years later in 1020 the completion of the memorial church known as Ashingdon Minster took place, on the hill next to the presumed site of the battle in Ashingdon. The church still stands to this day. Canute attended the dedication of Ashingdon Minster with his bishops and appointed his personal priest, Stigand, to be priest there. The church is now dedicated to Saint Andrew but is believed previously to have been dedicated to Saint Michael, who was considered a military saint: churches dedicated to him are frequently located on a hill. Battlefield location There is another possible location of the battle; Ashdon, also in Essex. There have been many finds of Roman and Anglo-Saxon coins in the area. Historians have argued inconclusively over the two sites for years. Also, the 10th-century wooden village church, itself possibly built on the site of a pre-Christian temple, was probably rebuilt in stone in the early 11th century, about the right time for Canute's conquest. Unfortunately little remains of the earlier structures, which were largely obliterated by the construction of the current church of All Saints during the late 13th to early 15th centuries.

The book is a striking example of postmodern narrative technique, in which different genres and styles of expression are mixed together. Plot summary Nicholas Dee, a young, anxiety-ridden history professor, lives in an unnamed American city battered by winter storms, plagued by crime, and patrolled by police in choppers and riot gear. Haunted by memories of his brilliant father and by the fear of loss, Nicholas takes shelter in his research: a history of the practice of insurance. One night, after a chance encounter with the police, he is made the guardian of a beautiful teenaged delinquent, Oscar Vega. But the boy is a part of a scheme to ensnare Nicholas, the tool of a mysterious female dwarf named Amelia Weathered, once the lover of Nicholas' father. Made an outlaw, Nicholas flees with Amelia, her young son Francis, and Oscar to the half-drowned country of Holland, where the boundaries between his historical research, his fantasies, and Amelia's schemes all begin to blend together. Scattered throughout the novel are passages from Nicholas Dee's scholarly writing, chronicle of a seventeenth century Dutch opera-house, which was built in a coastal swamp on the advice of a fortune-teller and housed a single performance before being swept out to sea in a storm. The chronicle is intended by Dee to serve as a case study within his history of insurance. But by the end of the book, a personal narrative has emerged from Dee's impersonal history, the story of a man's friendship with a boy soprano.

History  Its use as a common is quite late. Rights to the common were claimed by the inhabitants of Finchley at the beginning of the 15th century, and by the inhabitants of Friern Barnet, and Hornsey by the 16th century. Sale of timber in the 16th century by the Bishop of London, who had manorial rights to the land, led to the clearance of the woods, and after this time legal disputes between the commoners and the bishop were made reference to a \\"common called Finchley Wood\\". The earliest known use of the name Finchley Common appeared in reference to refugees escaping from plague London encamped on the common in 1603. Finchley Common occurs in Nicholas Culpeper's Herbal (1652) whereas John Gerard in his Herbal (1596) refers to Finchley Wood (2). As a place name Finchley Common continued long after the enclosure of 1816. Places which were said to be Finchley Common represented much of Finchley’s eastern flank. These included the Torrington public house (in what we would now call North Finchley), and also the White Lion in East Finchley. The last known active use of Finchley Common as a place name is an isolated property advert in The Times in 1897. There are sections of open ground in the London Borough of Haringey and the London Borough of Barnet which are still closely associated with Finchley Common (though no one uses the name), mostly woodland: Coppetts Wood, Coldfall Wood, and the Glebelands. Size Because of various claims made by the Bishop of London, and gradual encroachment Finchley Common's size varied. It was certainly greater than at its peak(2). By the time of the enclosure awards in 1816 encroachment had reduced it to around . Encroachment Small settlements began to encroach after the majority of the wood had been cleared in the 16th century. This was a very gradual process, but those who were fined by the bishop's steward for \\"contempt in enclosing a piece of the waste\\", occasionally went on to be allowed to stay on payment of rent, or even an annual fine. An example is Edward Hartill who was fined £1 in 1725 for encroachment, but who later went on to pay rent. Early encroachments included: Fallows Corner, Brownswell, Woodhouse, Woodside, Cuckhold’s Haven, and Cold Harbour. With expanding importance of the Great North Road (which ran across the Common) a number of inns were established from the end of the 17th century including: The White Lion, The Bald Faced Stag, the Horse Shoe, The Green Man and The Swan. The last of these, The Swan started as a windmill. The Bald Faced Stag and the White Lion are still in existence in modern-day East Finchley. The hog market At the southern end of the common an unofficial hog market developed by the end of the 17th century which became the largest in Middlesex. There were market days on Wednesday and Thursday (1717) with a lot of the business being conducted in inns like The Sow and Pigs. \\"Hogs are kept in considerable numbers, but chiefly by the malt-distillers, for whom they are purchased lean, at a large market, held on Finchley Common, and to which they are brought from Shropshire, and other distant counties: great numbers of fatted hogs are also bought for the hog-butcheries about London; and the bacon cured here is but little inferior to that brought from Wilts and Yorkshire.\\" (3) After enclosure the market continued. By the 1840s the market had decreased in importance and was only held on Mondays, and according to Kelly’s Directory of 1845 was frequented by butchers from the West End of London. By the 1890s auctions were only held every few months, and by the 1920s all trading ceased. Military encampments The common proved useful as a military encampment after the English Civil War until the Napoleonic War. The first known use was encampment was that of General Monck's army in 1660 and the Restoration. In May 1743 about a hundred soldiers of the 42nd Highland Regiment (The Black Watch) mutinied after attending a review on the common as they understood that they were soon to be dispatched to perilous duties in the British Caribbean colonies. Two years later, the common was the expected field of battle if the Bonnie Prince Charlie had reached London. It was here that the Duke of Cumberland mustered his army before their march north in 1745. The last major encampment was in 1780, when the Queen's Regiment and the South Hampshire Militia were quartered on the Common during the Gordon Riots. Until the 1820s, after which the enclosure had been completed, the area was used occasionally used for military training, but ceased to be of any significant military use. One of the latest known reports is a sham fight by the St Andrew's and St George's Volunteers in 1804. Highwaymen  Finchley Common is most associated with highwaymen. Its reputation was such that Sir Gilbert Elliott, Earl of Minto, stated in a letter to his wife that he would not \\"trust my throat on Finchley Common in the dark\\", and victims included great men such as Edmund Burke in 1774. It is said that Ralph Chaplin, the lover of Lady Katherine Ferrers \\"the Wicked Lady\\", was caught on Finchley Common (c.1660). There were certainly robberies committed before this date but the first crime in which Finchley Common is referred to in the Proceedings of the Old Bailey is that committed by Philip Maqueer on John Hansey in April 1690. A few of the highwaymen, such as Edmond Tooll (hanged and gibbeted in 1700), and Joseph Jackson (hanged 1720) were \\"of the parish\\", but the vast majority were from elsewhere, mostly London. (4) Gibbets were certainly located at the six mile (10 km) stone, possibly at Tally Ho Corner, and no doubt elsewhere. They were in use from at least the 1670s until the gibbeting of Cornelius Courte (a highwayman) in 1789(5). Famous villains associated with the common include Jack Sheppard and Dick Turpin. Neither was ever known to have actually committed any crimes on the common. Jack Sheppard was taken prisoner on the common in September 1724 reputedly wearing the blue and white apron of a butcher, and kept overnight at the George Inn in the Hog Market by a \\"posse of Newgate Prison turnkeys\\". Dick Turpin was not associated with the place until the period after enclosure. From the 1830s until 1952 a large oak, which stood in Oak Lane opposite the St. Pancras and Islington Cemetery was romantically known as Turpin’s Oak.(7) However the endeavours of the less famous are often more interesting. Two known as Everett and Williams went as far as drawing up a legally witnessed contract to the effect that they would split their ill- gotten gains after a year's work in 1725(8). It has been said that enclosure was the end of the highwayman on Finchley Common; but actually the period of this kind of crime was ending with the encouragement of paper money (then easily traced) through an Act for \\"Restricting Cash Payments\\" (1797). This enabled the use of £1 notes, and consequently travellers to London no longer carried huge amounts of gold on them. The other was the introduction of a simple police force: the Bow Street Horse Patrol patrolled the high road from Highgate to Barnet between 1805 and 1851. It was this patrol rather than enclosure that terminated the age of the highwayman on Finchley Common, but enclosure was generally held as responsible at the time. The last recognisable highwaymen are George Hurt and Enoch Roberts, who robbed Charles Locke in 1807 which is also the first case in which a member of the patrol (Wiliam Pickering) is mentioned (9).  Enclosure  Sir John Sinclair, President of the Board of Agriculture during the Napoleonic Wars, made a call for the enclosure of Finchley Common in 1803. \\"Let us not be satisfied with the liberation of Egypt, or the subjugation of Malta, but let us subdue Finchley Common; let us conquer Hounslow Heath, let us compel Epping Forest to submit to the yoke of improvement.\\" But an active campaign for enclosure (the process of transferring common land into individual ownership) began in 1805. It was \\"instigated\\" by John Bacon (a local land owner at Friern Barnet). An Act providing for the enclosure was passed in 1811, but the allotment awards (who got what) were not published until 1816. The common was placed in the Finchley parish, although Friern Barnet (but not Hornsey) freeholders and copyholders were granted allotments. In all there were 231 general allotments made. The process of \\"awards\\" of 1816 benefited only the landowners, in particular the Bishop of London, Thomas Allen, lord of the manor of Finchley at Bibbesworth, , and the rector of Finchley, a massive (10). The costs of enclosure were raised through the sale of parcels of land. The Regents Canal Company, had acquired of land to use as a reservoir at a cost of £80 per acre, and much was sold to Thomas Collins, of Woodhouse(11). An area of was set aside in the act of 1811 as Fuel Land, to be rented out to local farmers with the money used as a winter dole of fuel to the \\"deserving poor\\"(12). After enclosure The enclosed common with its excellent road connection to London was attractive to agencies that required large expanses of land. Later landowners were advertising in The Times land which was \\"well adapted for a cemetery of public building, situated near the high north road\\". The first of these, the St. Pancras Cemetery, was established in 1852. Enclosure also had an immediate effect upon agriculture, most of the former common lands being in a \\"high state of cultivation\\" by 1817, but without careful husbandry, however, the soil became exhausted by the 1830s. Much of the land became hay meadow, and later it was subsumed in the general trend to suburban development. Notes *1. These claims follows directly from the demise of the woods' economic values for farming fuel faggots for a number of important trades in London and the rise of coal as an alternative fuel.

The money may have been gained criminally, but as no specific case was referred to in court the two men were beyond the law. The case proved to be too much of a scandal, and both Everett and the solicitors on both sides, were fined £50 by the court. *9 Echos of the activities of the highwaymen would periodically surface. Secret hiding places in local inns like the Bald Faced Stag were, of course, attributed to the activities of the most famous (such as Dick Turpin), and his ghost periodically makes an appearance.

These awards and the plan of 1814 are available to view at London Borough of Barnet local studies unit in Mill Hill. *11 The company decided on the Welsh Harp site instead and sold the land in July 1818. Oddly enough the reservoir appears on the 1814 award plan. *12 The land was converted into garden allotments in the late 1840s, but passed into the hands of one of the trustees who turned them back into hayfields. The land was reopened as allotments in March 1890, after the Finchley Allotment League (modelling itself on the Birmingham Allotment League) forced the trustees to adhere to an act of 1882 requiring such land to be so used where there was local demand. The Fuel Lands are still used for allotments, but are now administered by the Finchley Charities. As such these allotments are the last lands governed by the act of 1811.

It is located ninety miles south of the university's main campus, in Pacific Grove, California (United States) on the Monterey Peninsula, adjacent to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. It is home to ten research laboratories and a fluctuating population of graduate and undergraduate students. It has also been used for archaeological exploration including that of the Chinese-American fishing village that existed on the site before being burnt down. History Agassiz Building viewed from Monterey Bay Aquarium. Named after Alexander Agassiz Hopkins Marine Station was founded in 1892, making it the oldest marine laboratory on the US Pacific Coast, and the second-oldest in the US, after the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. It was originally named the Hopkins Seaside Laboratory and located on what is now called Lover's Point. In 1917, the laboratory was moved to its current location on Mussel/China/Cabrillo Point, and given its current name: Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University. The marine station's namesake is Timothy Hopkins, the founder of the city of Palo Alto and an early supporter of Stanford University, not Johns Hopkins, founder of the Johns Hopkins University. The marine station is not affiliated with the latter. Hopkins Marine Life Refuge In 1931, the State of California adopted legislation designating the intertidal and subtidal areas around Hopkins Marine Station as the Hopkins Marine Life Refuge. The collection of marine invertebrates or plants is forbidden without a scientific collecting permit. The HMLR is the second-oldest Marine Life Refuge in California, after the San Diego Marine Life Refuge of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography. More recent legislation has been enacted to prevent chemical and thermal pollution of the water, to extend the boundaries of the refuge, and to prohibit the collection of fish, as well as invertebrates and plants, without a scientific collecting permit. Research at Hopkins Scientists at the marine station pursue research in a diverse range of biological fields, including biomechanics, biochemistry, developmental biology, neurobiology, ecology, evolution, and genetics. Studies utilize a great variety of organisms, but certain particularly useful and/or charismatic ones, such as mussels, squid, tuna, tunicates, sea urchins, and mudsuckers, have been the focus of continued research efforts. From 1963 to 1968, the station operated the research vessel R/V Te Vega, which sailed the Pacific and the Indian Ocean undertaking various studies, most notably of the Deep Scattering Layer. Data from the twenty Te Vega research voyages are still cited today, and one reference work remarks that, \\"[a]lthough ships from several nations participated in the Indian Ocean Expedition, only one has contributed significantly to marine phycology, namely, the Te Vega [...].\\"\\"History of Algal Exploration in the Indian Ocean.\\" In: Silva, Basson & Moe, Catalogue of the Benthic Marine Algae of the Indian Ocean.

It is designed for mobile device displays. Bing Mobile is built into Windows Mobile and Windows Phone as proprietary software, accessed via the Search key on Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8 devices. It is also available on Windows Phone 8.1 (and integrated with Microsoft Cortana where available), and can be downloaded for other platforms, including iOS and Android.  Windows Phone  With the launch of Windows Phone the new operating system included the Bing Hub, a centralised hub for contextual web searches and Bing Maps for navigation built in which gained some additional features such as showing users real-time traffic updates, street-view photos, 3D graphics and directions. To make Windows Phone hardware more uniform Microsoft requires all Windows Phones feature a dedicated \\"Search button\\" that opens up Bing Mobile. With Windows Phone 7.5, the first major update to Windows Phone Microsoft included several new features to the Bing Hub including the new Bing Vision application that allows users to scan QR Codes, books, price tags, and various other items but unlike Google Goggles, can not scan any object due to its limited functionality, other than scanning objects Bing Vision comes with a built in version of the Bing Translator that can scan texts and translate it into the phone's language, Engadget did a test they scanned the back cover a book and it only picked up about 90 percent of the words in the summary after the text was found, Bing Vision's translation feature supports 26 languages. Bing Maps also received new features namely the Bing Local Scout which takes a look at businesses around the user's location and gives them a list of local restaurants, bars and shopping centres. The Bing Hub can also open up Bing Local Scout and got a new feature addition in Windows Phone 7.5 called Bing Audio, a service similar to Shazam which can recognise songs and show the album in the Zune Marketplace. A notable difference between the Bing Hub and the website is the lack of Bing Travel. With the launch of Windows Phone 8 Microsoft did not include any major updates to the Bing Hub, but Microsoft later included a new Bing suite of applications. Bing News a customisable news aggregator which features headlines and videos of breaking news and allows users to track specific story categories, topics, or news sources. Bing Sports which shows sports headlines and games featuring 8 categories: recent scores, top sports headlines, videos, photos, schedules, standings and statistics. Bing Weather which in up-to-date conditions, temperature, precipitation and wind. And Bing Finance which showcases financial news, market information, currency conversions rates, stock option updates and customisable interactive charts for American markets. Subsequently, Microsoft launched Bing Travel, Bing Food & Drink, and Bing Health & Fitness applications which alongside the original suite of mobile apps were all rebranded under the MSN brand in 2014. In Windows Phone 8.1 Microsoft introduced Cortana to select markets, Cortana is an intelligent personal assistant built on top of the Bing Hub's Microsoft TellMe voice features. Cortana responds to a set of commands such as setting alarms, reminders, making suggestions based on the user's daily habits and frequented places, notify about the weather, turn up the latest headlines and news on the user's personal interests, a \\"do not disturb me\\" feature named Quiet hours which can set exceptions for contacts in the user's inner circle, predict sports events and tell jokes. For users who enabled Cortana Bing Audio/Bing Music remains included built into Cortana's Hub but Bing Vision becomes only accessible via the Microsoft Camera by selecting lenses. A common criticism against Cortana is that it does not understand or respond to queries as well as other digital assistants does and will open up a Bing search result when it does not understand the question. Exclusive to Microsoft Lumia devices with the Lumia Denim update is the \\"Hey Cortana\\" feature which allows users to open Cortana with voice activation while their Windows Phone is in standby mode.  Features   Bing for mobile browser - m.bing.com  Bing as viewed through the Android Browser. Mobile browsing allows users to access Bing on their mobile devices through WAP or GPRS connection.

The Bing app is available in the U.S. on a variety of Windows phones, Android platform devices, all BlackBerry devices, several BREW devices, iPhone and iPod Touch, and Sidekick devices. In April 2015 Microsoft redesigned the Google Android and iOS versions of Bing Mobile and implemented several new \\"cards\\" such as the \\"image of the day card\\" which shows Bing's rotating images and additional information, the \\"popular now card\\" which contains information on the most popular searched items of that day, a \\"Bing Rewards card\\" which shows the user's Bing Rewards points and serves as a central hub for Bing's search settings, a \\"Settings card\\" where users can alter their Safe Search filter and change what content they can see and which content they do not want to see, and a \\"Footer card\\" which gives users the ability to send feedback to Microsoft.  iOS  The Bing app for iOS (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad) includes these further features: * Barcode and cover art scanning * Enhanced product listings * Social updates from Facebook and Twitter * Social search - see results from social network alongside web results * Share search results on Facebook, Twitter, or through email * Weather - get information about local and international weather * Trending - see what news is trending in the world *Image Match - upload an image and get results for similar looking images *Sharing options through various messaging applications like WeChat and WhatsApp  Bing 411  In the United States, Microsoft operated a toll-free number (1-800-BING-411 or 1-800-CALL-411) for directory assistance called Bing 411. This service was identical, except for the opening message, with the voice search service powered by Tellme on 1-800-555-TELL. Users were able to find local shops and restaurants and obtain driving directions, traffic reports, sports scores, stock quotes, news, and weather reports through this service. Service on 1-800-BING-411 and 1-800-555-TELL was discontinued on June 1, 2012. The 1-800-CALL-411 number was discontinued a few months later. As a replacement for Bing 411, Tellme Networks, offering similar services, has set up a non-toll-free number at 408-752-8052.

During development and very early production, it was developed from the De Tomaso Biguá concept car shown to the general public at the 1996 Geneva Motor Show. When the car started production, it was renamed De Tomaso Mangusta (named after the car originally built between 1967 and 1971) before De Tomaso became disassociated from the project and all subsequent cars received Qvale badging. The Mangusta uses a front mid- engine, rear-wheel drive layout and was penned by Italian automotive designer Marcello Gandini. It’s powertrain, technical basis and components were largely provided by American manufacturer Ford Motor Company. It is powered by a 4.6 L DOHC Ford modular V8 engine and was offered with either a 5-speed manual transmission „T45“, sourced from American automotive components developer, manufacturer and supplier BorgWarner, or a 4-speed automatic transmission sourced from American car manufacturer Chevrolet (GM). History In 1993 and 1994, Maserati technical director Giordano Casarini made a number of business trips to the United Kingdom and, while there, first saw the TVR Griffith. He was impressed by the style and sales success of such a low-production-volume car. Alejandro de Tomaso had meanwhile suffered a stroke in 1993. After a period of recovery, de Tomaso asked Casarini (whom he considered a trusted friend) what should be done with the De Tomaso company. Casarini suggested that De Tomaso make \\"an Italian TVR\\", pointing out the positive design elements that made the Griffith attractive. Alejandro de Tomaso negotiated with the Maserati chairman to release Casarini to De Tomaso, so that work on the design could begin. Casarini intended to use an existing, inexpensive V8 engine that would reduce the purchase and maintenance costs of the car. In the tradition of De Tomaso cars, he wished to use a Ford V8 and explored the possibility of using the new Ford Modular 4.6 L V8, but discovered that Ford was not yet ready to sell it to manufacturers. Rear view Casarini learned that TVR was investigating the possibility of using differentials made by Australian company BTR Automotive in its cars. When communicating with a supplier for the differentials, he was directed towards Holden Special Vehicles (HSV), who indicated that they would be able to offer engines and transmissions. At this stage, the De Tomaso project was given the internal code name \\"ETX\\". Soon after Casarini's communications with HSV, Ford Motor Company contacted him with the news that they would indeed be able to supply the Modular V8, along with transmissions, ancillaries, and electrical systems. Alejandro de Tomaso had been a fan of the design work done by Marcello Gandini, so Gandini was called to Modena to discuss the job of styling the new De Tomaso project. To show him the character and feel of the desired product, Gandini was driven around in a TVR Griffith. He was ultimately commissioned for the styling job, and was given the instruction that the folding roof mechanism on the De Tomaso be similar to the multi-position roof used by the Griffith. A prototype of the car was displayed at the 1996 Geneva Motor Show and was called the De Tomaso Biguà, though it still needed development before it would reach full production. The company required capital to continue, and an initial appeal to the Italian government failed due to the declining health of Alejandro de Tomaso. Eventually, the company approached the Qvale family, who, led by Kjell Qvale, had been a North American importer for the original De Tomaso Mangusta in the 1960s and later Maserati when it was under De Tomaso ownership. Qvale agreed to fund the development of the car, with the agreement that the final product would be sold under the De Tomaso brand, as the De Tomaso Mangusta. The agreement between De Tomaso and Qvale was soured over licensing and distribution issues. Bruce Qvale, who was managing Qvale at the time decided to produce the car under the Qvale name after an investment of over US$30 million on the development of the car. In 1997, the Qvale Modena SpA company was established to produce the Mangusta. Bruce Qvale led the project of developing a production facility, which involved the renovation and modernization of a building in Modena. The building was \\"elegantly and comprehensively furnished, [with] marble everywhere\\", and certified ISO 9001 compliant. Design and technology right The chassis of the Mangusta was designed by former Formula 1 designer Enrique Scalabroni, who had worked for Dallara, Williams F1, and Scuderia Ferrari. Each chassis is formed of welded laser-cut steel sections, and was then galvanized by Vaccari & Bosi. Body panels were constructed of resin transfer moulding (RTM) plastic by Stratime Cappelo Systems of Villers-Cotterêts, France; this same company had provided bodywork using the RTM technology for the Alfa Romeo SZ and the Lotus Elan M100. The panels were then painted by Italian company Rovercoat S.p.A. before they were fitted to a car. The first simple mock-up of the chassis design was done by Casarini and Scalabroni assembling pieces of packing cardboard to show the basic layout. Scalabroni placed emphasis on high torsional rigidity of the chassis, which was particularly important as the final design would not have a structural roof. The design also emphasized safety: significant impact energy during a front-end collision is dissipated by lateral movement of the engine. In tests, the Mangusta chassis showed a torsional stiffness of 1450 kg/m/deg, which was more than four times the typical stiffness of an open car at the time. Both the front and rear suspension on the Mangusta uses double wishbones with coil springs and anti-roll bars. The Mangusta uses a unique roof mechanism referred to as the \\"roto-top\\", designed by Gandini and inspired by the folding roof of the TVR Griffith. The roto-top features a center removable panel (similar to normal targa configurations) but also allows the rear section to electrically rotate (on a forward pivot) out of sight into a cavity behind the seats. This transforms the car into a full convertible. In the Mangusta's interior, most visible surfaces are covered in leather. Visteon Automotive Systems was selected as the supplier for the interior electrical systems. In order to save maintenance costs, the interior shares many parts with the Ford Mustang SVT Cobra. The alloy wheels for the Mangusta were produced by Antera. When the Mangusta was transitioned from a prototype to production model, Carlo Gaino of Synthesis Design was contracted to perform any necessary adjustments to the design. Synthesis Design developed two cars: one was the restyling of the production car, the other an evolution based on the reduction of production costs. Production and launch 2001 Qvale Mangusta The first De Tomaso Mangusta was completed on November 10, 1999. On January 6, 2000, at the Los Angeles Motor Show, Bruce Qvale announced the return of the De Tomaso brand to North America with the new Mangusta. Also announced was the Mangusta's entry into racing, with Qvale Motorsports entering a car sponsored by Tommy Bahama into the BF Goodrich Tires Trans-Am Series. The Mangusta went on sale for US$78,900 on January 20, 2000, with a single ordering option of 18-inch alloy wheels. As the Mangusta was being launched, Alejandro de Tomaso was independently pursuing another design project (which was to recycle the De Tomaso Pantera name). Because the De Tomaso company was being financially supported by Qvale at the time, this caused disharmony between Qvale and de Tomaso that ultimately resulted in the decision to discontinue their cooperation on the project. The De Tomaso Mangusta was renamed the \\"Qvale Mangusta\\", and production continued. Twenty- nine cars were manufactured for the purpose of crash-testing and homologation. Also, a partially completed right-hand-drive Qvale Mangusta was shown at the British Motor Show in October 2000 and was later sold as street legal in Europe. Eighteen cars were sold new in Europe. Overall, 284 cars were sold. Reception Automotive journalists and testers praised the car for its performance and handling, and for the utility of the roto-top. Some build quality issues were noted on early cars, and the reaction to the unconventional styling was mixed. Lackluster sales figures in 2000 prompted Qvale to reduce the price of model year 2001 cars by nearly 10,000 USD, which the company announced on October 13, 2000. Connection with MG In the summer of 2000, after BMW had sold the MG Rover Group to the Phoenix Consortium, Bruce Qvale contacted one of the Consortium directors, Nick Stephenson, and proposed forming a European distribution deal for the Qvale Mangusta. Soon after, Stephenson and his colleagues began to consider the possibility of using the Mangusta platform to develop a high-performance halo car to grow the MG brand. On February 28, 2001, Stephenson and his colleague Peter Beale began negotiations with Qvale Modena to purchase Mangusta production assets. A contract was drawn, and on June 19 of that year, the announcement was made that the deal was complete (with account reports indicating that the price was £7 million.) Under the MG Rover group, the Qvale Mangusta platform was developed into the MG XPower SV.
