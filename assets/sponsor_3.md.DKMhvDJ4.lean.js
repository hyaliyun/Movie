They are characteristically felsic. The feldspar component of syenogranite is predominantly alkaline in character (usually orthoclase). For example, the syenogranite in the Salmon Mountains in Idaho is pink to tan and composed of 45‚Äì55% alkali feldspar, 15‚Äì20% plagioclase, 15‚Äì20% quartz, 5‚Äì8% biotite, 3‚Äì5% hornblende, and accessory magnetite (Evans and Green, 2003). Syenogranite is similar to syenite, however the major difference is its higher content of quartz (15-25%) usually at the expense of some alkali feldspar (45-50%), the domination of biotite over hornblende and the presence of muscovite and rutile as additional accessories in the syenogranite. Some syenogranite contain rare idiomorphic amphibole (Fe- hornblende and Fe-edenite), biotite (annite 25%-35%), plagioclase (An3), along with K-feldspar and quartz. (Mafti, 2001).

The rank originated from the older rank of sergeant major general (French: sergent-major g√©n√©ral). Sergeant major general was third in command in an army, after the general and the lieutenant general. One of his tasks was to dispose the troops on the battlefield. It was also known in the French army as the \\"battle sergeant\\" (fr: sergent de bataille). In English-speaking countries, the rank of sergeant major general became known as simply major general. Background and history The mar√©chal de camp rank was the junior of the two officer general ranks of the French Army, the senior being lieutenant general. The rank of brigadier was intermediate between those of colonel and mar√©chal de camp, but was not considered a general officer rank. Nevertheless, when rank insignia were introduced in the 1770s, the brigadier insignia was one star on each epaulette, that of the mar√©chal de camp two stars (as was its foreign equivalent, the rank of major general). However the mar√©chal de camp was entitled a general's uniform, the brigadier des arm√©es du roi still wore his regiment's uniform. When the rank of brigadier was abolished in 1788, mar√©chals de camp assumed command of brigades in the French Army, but kept their two-star insignia. In 1793, during the French Revolution, the rank was renamed brigade general (g√©n√©ral de brigade), as the brigade was its normal command. With the Bourbon Restoration in 1815, the rank of brigade general became once again mar√©chal de camp, but was changed back again to brigade general after the French Revolution of 1848.

The behavior of a group of 13 Syrian musicians, on their way to an engagement in San Diego, was deemed suspicious by at least one passenger, who raised concerns that they were observing a terrorist attack or a dry run test. One passenger, journalist Annie Jacobsen, wrote a series of articles about the incident, bringing it to national attention. A redacted version of the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General's report was released in May 2007 as a result of a Freedom of Information Act request made by the Washington Times. The incident Before takeoff, 14 men of Middle Eastern descent boarded the aircraft. Thirteen of the 14 men were Syrian nationals in the USA on short-term visas, using one-way tickets which they had paid for in cash. Their visas had expired on June 10, but they had filed for extensions, which were eventually granted. During the flight, Annie Jacobsen, a writer for WomensWallStreet, believed that the men were acting suspiciously. She claimed that one of the flight attendants had previously notified an air marshal on board the flight that she thought the men were acting suspiciously, but the air marshals later said that a flight attendant had merely passed on Jacobsen's concerns. Jacobsen and her husband became increasingly vocal when they believed that their concerns were not being taken seriously, to the point that air marshals believed that the couple might themselves be terrorists, trying to draw them out to reveal their identities. In a series of articles for WomensWallStreet titled \\"Terror in the Skies, Again?,\\" Jacobsen claimed that several other Flight 327 passengers have corroborated her story including one who was so frightened by what she witnessed that she no longer travels by air and others said they were convinced they were about to die. One such passenger confirmed the story to the Washington Times. Debate over what happened on the flight became an Internet phenomenon, according to CNN's Aaron Brown. Jacobsen's articles were translated into many languages including Chinese, Swahili and German as it circulated around the globe. In the WomensWallStreet articles, Jacobsen detailed the activity she took to be suspicious. She claimed that before boarding, the men did not interact or seem to be part of a group. Further, she claimed that during boarding, each man made eye contact with each of the others and nodded as if in agreement. One man, who wore an orthopedic shoe, complained loudly, just before takeoff, that he needed to switch seats. Once in flight, one of the men took a large McDonald's bag to a lavatory, exiting with the bag nearly empty, and giving the thumbs up sign as he passed two other suspicious men. Some of the other men also took objects with them to the lavatory, such as a mass of cloth, a camera, and a cell phone. Throughout the flight, the men would get up in unison, walk to the lavatories, and congregate in the aisles in groups of two and three. One of the men, wearing a suit and sunglasses, stood a foot or so away from the cockpit door. When the captain announced clearance for landing, seven of the men stood in unison and went to the lavatory, each taking about four minutes. The last man to exit the lavatory supposedly dragged his forefinger across his neck as he passed one of the other men, mouthing the word \\"No.\\" Upon arriving in Los Angeles, the 14 men that Jacobsen saw were detained for questioning and identity verification. The Federal Air Marshal Service concluded that they were Syrian band members en route to a San Diego casino to perform. Jacobsen claims, however, that only two of the men were briefly investigated and nobody has determined where the men went after leaving the airport. The Sycuan Casino & Resort confirmed that Syrian singer Nour Mhanna performed there two days later, and that he brought his own backup band. Reaction to reports In a later interview to TIME magazine, the lead air marshal aboard the flight stated, \\"there was never a time when my main partner or I felt there was an imminent threat to that airplane or the passengers...I understand why the passenger felt some anxiety about activity on Flight 327 but that kind of activity was unusual but not a security incident. There was never a threat to the plane.\\" The Homeland Security report produced by the Inspector General revealed that this air marshal had noticed that the Syrians' travel visas were expired but the air marshal failed to report this information to his supervisors, claiming it was out of his jurisdiction. Furthermore, the federal air marshals believed that Jacobsen \\"over-reacted\\" at the presence of persons of Middle Eastern appearance on the flight and \\"was in danger of panicking other passengers and creating a larger problem\\". They were also concerned that Jacobsen's actions were part of a terrorist plot to create a disturbance in order that the marshals be identified and that she \\"could have put the entire flight in danger\\". The Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Inspector General, spent twenty-two months investigating Flight 327; the report has been classified, but a redacted version reveals that the musical group's promoter, who was on the plane, had been involved in a similar incident in January 2004. A Washington Times story claimed that some air marshals believed that Northwest flight 327 was a \\"dry run\\" for a future terrorist attack involving commercial planes, but did not quote any air marshal making that claim, neither with attribution nor anonymously. A follow-up story revealed the Freedom of Information Act request and promised more details to come. Gary Boettcher, president of the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations, however, said that Jacobsen had likely witnessed a dry run, and that he had many similar experiences himself. Federal Air Marshal P. Jeffrey Black confirmed that in his opinion, Flight 327 was a terrorist probe or dry run. Mark Bogosian, an American Airlines pilot, said that incidents like the one Jacobsen described were a \\"dirty little secret\\" that airline crew members had known for some time. Jacobsen's original article was distributed widely through emails, and the veracity of her claims was discussed and dismissed on the Snopes urban legend website, which determined them to be \\"false\\".

It is owned and lived in by the Palmer family.  Early history  Dorney Manor is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, as having been held before the Norman Conquest by Aldred, a man of Earl Morcar. In 1086, it was among the lands of Miles Crispin, and his tenant was a certain Ralf. From here it passed successively to families named Cave, Parker, Newnham, Paraunt, Carbonell, Scott, Restwold, Lytton, Bray, and Hill. In 1542, James Hill sold Dorney to Sir William Garrard, later Lord Mayor of London, and ancestor of the Palmer family which still owns and occupies Dorney Court today.Victoria County History of Buckinghamshire s.v. Dorney (vol 3, 1925) pp 221‚Äì225.  Acquisition by Palmer family  Sir William Garrard, who bought the manor of Dorney from James Hill in 1542, served as Lord Mayor of London in 1555. He died in 1571, and was succeeded by his elder son, also called Sir William Garrard, who died in 1607 to be succeeded by his younger brother, Sir John Garrard.Burke's Extinct Baronetcies (1841) s.v. Garrard of Lamer The daughter of Sir William Garrard was Martha (died 1617), who married James Palmer (later Sir James Palmer, knighted 1629), and Dorney Court was acquired by her husband in 1624. This followed disputes within the Garrard family over the property, centred on Martha's brother Thomas Garrard, who married against the wishes of his father and whose own wife with her family also embroiled him in disputes. Sir James Palmer (1585‚Äì1658), first of the Palmers of Dorney Court, was a younger son of Sir Thomas Palmer, baronet, of Wingham, Kent. He was Gentleman of the Bedchamber to James I and Charles I, Chancellor of the Order of the Garter (from 1645), a personal friend of Charles II, and an artist and miniature painter. He was also an adviser to the royal collection, and governor of the Royal Tapestry Works, Mortlake. His portrait of James I is in the Victoria & Albert Museum collection, his portrait of the Earl of Southampton is in the Fitzwilliam Collection, Cambridge and his portrait of the Earl of Northampton is in the Royal Collection.Sir James Palmer, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography From Sir James, Dorney Court has passed from father to son in direct succession in the Palmer family down to the present day. His younger son was created Earl of Castlemaine but his older son inherited Dorney (Sir Philip Palmer, 1615‚Äì1683). Sir Philip's fourth but, at his death, oldest surviving son was Charles Palmer of Dorney (1651‚Äì1714). Charles Palmer's son inherited a baronetcy previously held by the senior branch of the family, the Palmers of Wingham in Kent. He therefore in 1723 became Sir Charles Palmer, 5th baronet, of Dorney. His own son, also called Charles Palmer, died before him, and so he was succeeded at his death by his grandson, Sir Charles Harcourt Palmer, 6th baronet, of Dorney. Sir Charles Harcourt Palmer of Dorney, 6th and last baronet, had a number of children by his cousin, but no marriage was proved, and so the children were illegitimate and the title came to an end at his death in 1838 (see G.E.C.'s Complete Baronetage vol I (1900) s.v. Palmer, and also Burke's Extinct Baronetcies). Dorney Court, however, continued to be inherited by succeeding generations of the Palmer family.Burke's Landed Gentry (1952 edition) \\"Palmer of Dorney Court\\" Dorney Court is still privately owned and lived in by Jill Palmer (widow) and her sons: James, Freddie and Leopold Palmer.  Building  On first appearances the building appears to be entirely medieval, but in fact some of the exterior is a Victorian reconstruction. The remodelling of the house was undertaken at the end of the nineteenth century and the original bricks were restored to the front facade of the house. The interior layout of the house is little changed from 1500. The oldest part of the house is the panelled parlour, which contains some very fine examples of antique furniture.The Country Life book of Castles and Houses in Britain. . The great hall has numerous family portraits and contains linenfold panelling brought from Faversham Abbey, in times past it was used to hold the Manor court and it is still the site of the annual Commoners meeting. The house has been open to the public since 1981. It has featured as a location in numerous films and TV programmes, such as Midsomer Murders, ITV's Agatha Christie's Poirot episodes \\"The Adventure of the Western Star\\" and \\"Sad Cypress\\", 24: Live Another Day, Zombies, Pride and Prejudice and The New World.

In cross section they have the shape of an eye. Feldspar, quartz, and garnet are common minerals which form augen. Augen form in rocks which have undergone metamorphism and shearing. The core of the augen is a porphyroblast or porphyroclast of a hard, resilient mineral such as garnet. The augen grows by crystallisation of a mantle of new mineral around the porphyroblast. The mantle is formed contiguous with the foliation which is imparted upon the rock, and forms a blanket which tapers off from either side of the porphyroblast within the strain shadows. During shearing, the porphyroblast may rotate, to form a characteristic augen texture of asymmetric shearing. In this case, the position of the tails is unequal across the foliation, with some augen showing clear drag folding of the mantle into the strain shadow. This derives a form of shear direction information. A metamorphic rock which is clotted with augen is often called an augen gneiss. A long wall of this augen gneiss can be felt at the Mineral and Lapidary Museum of Western North Carolina.

He served as the first Bishop of Reno in 1931‚Äì1952, and the fourth Bishop of Dallas in 1954‚Äì1969. Biography Thomas Kiely Gorman was born in Pasadena, California, to John Joseph and Mary Elizabeth (n√©e Kiely) Gorman. He entered St. Patrick's Seminary in Menlo Park in 1910, shortly before his father's death, and was transferred to St. Mary's Seminary, Baltimore, Maryland, in 1914. Gorman was ordained to the priesthood on June 23, 1917. After studying at the Catholic University of America for a year, he returned to California and did pastoral work in the Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles until 1922. Gorman graduated in 1925 from the University of Louvain, from where he obtained a doctorate in history. He was editor of the Tidings, a diocesan newspaper in Los Angeles, from 1926-31. On April 24, 1931, Gorman was appointed the first Bishop of Reno by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following July 22 from Archbishop John Cantwell, with Bishops John Mitty and Robert Armstrong serving as co- consecrators. Gorman was later named Coadjutor Bishop of Dallas, Texas, and Titular Bishop of Rhasus on February 8, 1952. He succeeded Joseph Patrick Lynch as the fourth Bishop of Dallas upon the latter's death on August 29, 1954. John F. Kennedy, the first and only Roman Catholic to date to serve as President of the United States, was shot and killed in Dallas during Gorman's tenure. He attended the Second Vatican Council from 1962-65. Despite his original support for their ecumenical work, Gorman relieved four Texan Paulist priests of their duties in 1967 for purportedly neglecting their responsibility of servicing the Newman Clubs at local colleges. His decision met widespread opposition, but he refused to reverse it.

The band was founded as \\"The Makem Brothers\\" in February 1989 by Rory, Shane, and Conor Makem, the three sons of \\"The Godfather of Irish Music\\" Tommy Makem, and grandsons of Irish source singer Sarah Makem. In 2003, brothers Liam and Mickey Spain joined, and the band was renamed \\"The Makem and Spain Brothers\\". When Shane and Conor Makem left in 2014, the band was renamed \\"Makem and Spain\\". On March 5, 2018, Makem & Spain announced on their Facebook page that they were breaking up, bringing down the final curtain on the act originally known as the Makem Brothers. Biography The three Makem brothers were born in Drogheda, County Louth, Ireland and grew up in Dover, New Hampshire, where the family moved to in the mid 1970s. Their father, Tommy Makem, was one of the most famous Irish musicians in the world, first as a member of The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem and later as a solo act. Tommy's mother was the singer and traditional song collector Sarah Makem. The Makem Brothers' elder sister Katie Makem is also a performer, although she does not tour professionally. Shane Makem was born in August 1967, Conor in September 1968 and Rory in October 1969. Both Shane and Conor attended Stonehill College in Easton, Massachusetts and Rory went to Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. As a student at Bard College, Rory formed a band with Lisa Gentile, Lisa Lisa and the Country Jam. In February 1989, Shane and Rory Makem founded the band, the Makem Brothers, debuting at the now-closed Blackthorne Tavern in Easton, Massachusetts. Guitarist Brian Sullivan joined the duo soon after. The Makem Brothers and Brian Sullivan were set to perform at the Tom Clancy Memorial Concert in New York City in November 1991; for the event, they wanted a bass player. Their father, Tommy Makem, suggested their middle brother, Conor Makem, and so he debuted with his brothers and Brian Sullivan at the memorial concert. In 1992, the quartet recorded a demo album which was later commercially released for a time. Songs on the demo included Charlie and the MTA and Maid of Fife-O. In 1994 the Makem Brothers and Brian Sullivan released their first full-length album, Out Standing in a Field. Also that year, they made their television debut on Tommy Makem's PBS television special, Songs of the Sea. Judy Collins also performed on that special. Brian Sullivan left the band in 1995 but stayed on to play backup on the Makem Brothers' second album, On the Rocks. The Makem Brothers continued as a trio for eight more years, releasing two more albums, Who Fears to Speak in 1998 and Stand Together in 2001. In 1997 they filmed a concert for Iowa PBS which was released on videocassette. In 2003, the New Hampshire-based Irish folk musicians teamed up with The Spain Brothers, Liam and Mickey Spain (both natives of Manchester, New Hampshire), to become The Makem and Spain Brothers. Though they had been informally performing together for several years, their first official concert as a five piece band took place at the Narrows Center for the Arts in Fall River, Massachusetts in February 2003. They were billed as the Makem Brothers with Mickey and Liam Spain. Their combined forces preserve and advance folk music from Ireland, Scotland, Wales and New England, as well as whaling songs, fishing songs, mining songs, even Australian Bush songs. Influences include The Clancy Brothers, Ewan MacColl, and The Corries. The Makem and Spain Brothers released their first album together in 2004, called Like Others Did Before Us. They recorded a live album on Good Friday 2005 and released the album, The Makem and Spain Brothers Live in 2006. They recorded and filmed a live concert in Butte, Montana, releasing both a DVD and a CD of the concert in 2008. Both releases were called The Makem and Spain Brothers Home Away From Home. In January 2011, they released a studio album, titled Up the Stairs. Shane left the band in 2011 for unknown reasons. In October 2013, Conor Makem was arrested for allegedly placing a hidden camera in a women's bathroom. The police confiscated his American and Irish passports, which prevented him from participating in the band's annual musical tour of Ireland. Conor Makem was sentenced to a year incarceration at Strafford County House of Corrections in May 2014 after pleading guilty to 19 invasion of privacy charges. According to their website www.makem.com, the band, now a trio consisting of Rory Makem, Mickey Spain and Liam Spain, was officially renamed Makem & Spain. In 2012, the Makem and Spain Brothers created their first Kickstarter campaign drive to help fund their next two albums, a two volume set titled Sessions Vol. 1 and Sessions Vol. 2 which would feature a multitude of guest musicians including but not limited to Tom Paxton, Schooner Fare, The Shaw Brothers, Gordon Bok and David Mallett. A goal of $15,000 was surpassed, capping out at over $20,000. After several delays, Makem & Spain Brothers Sessions Vol. 1 saw a limited release in late May 2014 to contributors. On June 3, the album, re- titled \\"Sessions, Vol. I - Makem and Spain,\\" was released on iTunes. Finally, on August 3, it was released on compact disc to the general public. There are two different versions of the album cover; copies distributed to Kickstarter contributors contain the group name 'The Makem & Spain Brothers' with photos of all four group members at the time; copies available to purchase by the general public on August 3 and henceforth include the new group name, 'Makem & Spain,' with photos of just Rory, Mickey and Liam. On January 12, 2016, Makem and Spain released a new studio album, Four Pounds a Day. It is the 10th full- length album for the group as a whole, excluding the 1992 demo CD. According to their Facebook page, , the record was originally called For Ramblin' For Rovin', after lyrics taken from the song Bold Thady Quill, track number 10 on the album. Sessions Vol. 2 was released on October 6, 2016, making this the first time the group released two albums in one year. It would be their final album. Break up In 2014, Rory Makem, the youngest son of Tommy Makem, started performing as a solo act, in addition to touring and recording with Makem and Spain. Donal Clancy, youngest son of Liam Clancy, released an album of songs, Songs of a Roving Blade, the first to feature him on vocals as a solo; previously he sang as part of a chorus with his father, Liam, and cousin, Robbie O'Connell, in the group, Clancy O'Connell & Clancy, while focusing on instrumentals. Promoting his album, he began touring as a solo performer that year. In the summer 2016, Rory and Donal joined forces at the Milwaukee Irish Festival, performing sporadically for the remainder of the year. They featured as a duo on Joannie Madden's Folk and Irish Cruise that fall, billed as Makem and Clancy. They toured the American Irish Festival circuit in the summer of 2017, and occasionally tour together as of October 2019, as well as solo. Makem & Spain performed less than half a dozen concerts during 2017, and on March 5, 2018, they announced on their Facebook page that they were breaking up: \\"Hello all. We reluctantly announce that we will no longer be performing as a trio. Rory will be performing with Donal Clancy as well as a solo artist. Mickey will perform as a solo artist as well as with his brother Liam. We would like to thank everyone for the support that you have given us over the years and we hope that you will continue to enjoy, attend and support folk music. Cheers, Mickey, Rory and Liam\\" Their final concert was at the 2nd Annual Folk Extravaganza in Manchester, NH at the Palace Theatre on October 6, 2017.

It is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean in the south; the Pacific and Gulf of Montijo to the west, and by the Gulf of Panama in the east. The peninsula is effectively divided into two regions; the Western Azuero and the Eastern Azuero, as no serviceable roads join the two peninsula regions past the Pan-American Highway. The Eastern Azuero Peninsula is known for baseball and is also a center of activity during the annual carnaval (carnival), with Las Tablas being the hub. Pedasi is a small fishing town with sport fishing. The Western Azuero Peninsula is known for its cattle ranching, farming, fishing, sunsets and beaches. Tourism has begun to increase in the area both for the aforementioned sport fishing, surfing and for the local charm of cities like Chitr√©, Las Tablas and Pedasi. Due to a rise in tourism, real estate development has begun. The area enjoys some of the best weather in Panama being in a region known as the \\"Arco Seco\\" (dry arc). Geography Azuero is divided into three provinces, Herrera, Los Santos (which are entirely on the peninsula), and Veraguas which extends into it on the west side of the peninsula. Most of the people live on the east coastal region. The southern tip is sparsely populated, and western area (the Veraguas area) is just now opening up to development. The largest towns are Chitr√©, the capital of Herrera, and Las Tablas. The main road to the eastern Azuero peninsula connects to the Pan-American Highway in Divisa and runs south along the eastern side of the peninsula. The road to the western Azuero connects to the Pan-American just east of Santiago. Punta Mariato on the western tip of the peninsula is the southernmost point on the mainland of Central America. History The Azuero region was one of the first parts of Panama to be settled more than 10,000 years ago, and the area in the north of the peninsula was cultivated thousands of years before the arrival of the Spaniards. Environment Its long history of cultivation and grazing has had a negative impact on the environment, resulting in what is sometimes called the Sarigua desert in the northeastern area of the peninsula, even though it is not technically a desert. Along the coast there are areas of mangroves and just inland is a dry coastal forest called Albina. The Azuero is one of the most heavily deforested parts of Panam√°, although sustainable land management systems such as SilvoPastoral grazing systems are emerging. In the extreme south, Cerro Hoya is a national park and home of most of the remaining jungle habitat in the Azuero region. Isla Canas, a coastal island connected via a sandbar to the peninsula, is used by a large number of sea turtles to lay their eggs each year.

The Church is a rare architectural example of a single-nave vaulted- ceiling temple, and the only one in the traditional Entre-Douro-e-Minho Province region of Portugal. It is classified as a National Monument. History The main facade of the Church of Cedofeita, still maintaining the Romanesque elements and dark granite stone The rear oblique profile of the symmetrical church body The oldest document referring to the Church dates from 1087, when it was consecrated and funds allocated for its upkeep. From surveys of the building, at least two former structures occupied the same place: one built around the 10th century, from which two Pre-romanesque capitals are preserved in the interior; and another consecrated in 1098, by the Bishop of Braga, from which the lower part of the main chapel has survived. The more remote vestiges, now preserved, suggest a dating to the late 9th, early 10th century. It has been debated that, following his reconquest of the city of Porto, V√≠mara Peres, in 868, constructed or rebuilt a temple (whose remaining two triumphal arch capitals were later reused in the Romanesque period). These capitals are one of the most important indicators of constructive dynamics that accompanied the first conquest of the territories along the Douro and stylistically relate to the late-Asturian construction (such as in the churches of S√£o Salvador and Valdedi√≥s Priesca, both from the beginning of the tenth century.Manuel Lu√≠s Real (1984), p.31 One of the vestiges of this period was the use of soft limestone (from the region of Coimbra), a fact that contrasts with the widespread use of granite in later public works. In the 11th century construction campaign that followed, supported and consecrated in 1087 by the Bishop of Braga (D. Pedro), included the lower areas of the chancel, whose blind arcades were constructed in a more archaic style. The truly Romanesque phase actually began late, around the 13th century. A document during the reign of King Afonso II of Portugal mentioned the construction of the building during the reign of Afonso I of Portugal, although archaeological proof of these statements have yet to be discovered on the site. References to Cedofeita continued throughout the 12th and 13th centuries, referring to the existence of a monastery in Cedofeita, alternating with dispatches about a religious college, continuing until the first quarter of the 13th century. The community of religious clerics adopted the orders of the Canons Regular of Saint Augustine; historically, references to the temple referred to a much larger Convento dos C√≥negos Regrantes de Santo Agostinho (Convent of the Canons Regular of Saint Augustine). The religious community was supported by the founding of a factory in the beginning of the 13th century, which helped to develop the parish. By the 16th century, the College of Cedofeita was one of the largest property-owners in the area of Porto, supported by land-rents from the district and donations from the faith community. Between the 17th and 18th century, the church was remodelled, with the extension of lateral chapels from the fourth section of the nave. The front entranceway was tiled (hiding the original western facade), while a new bell-tower and a southern cloister were built, at the same time the chancel was extended by two metres, while its barrel ceiling was elaborated in stucco. In the middle of the 18th century, the canons at Cedofeita were willing to impose a cost of one Portuguese real on its parishioners in order to rebuild the church. An inscription was made into the western door tympanum around 1767, stating that the Church was founded in 559 by King Theodemar, and consecrated by the Bishop of Braga, Lucr√©cio (561‚Äì562). Although it was copied from a parchment found in the canon's archives in 1556, the original stone, on which it was based, has never been found. In 1869, the college of canons was extinguished, although the building continued to function as a parochial church. By 1880, an organ by Peter Conacher was installed in the church. Formal restoration of the Church began in 1930, and lasted the next five years, under the stewardship of the Direc√ß√£o Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (DGMEN), resulting in the identification of several additions to the church during the 17th and 18th century. These renovations removed many of the late Baroque additions and gave it a more \\"medieval\\" appearance. It was during these restorations that the organ was disassembled and removed from the Church. Successively, the building was further restored through several periods of renovation, including in 1966, 1975, 1979, 1980, 1982, 1984 (when the chancel roof was re-tiled) and in 1991 (when electricity was introduced into the structure and the roof over the main nave was reconstructed). Architecture The western entranceway showing the three semi-circular arches and inscription Close-up of the 17th‚Äì18th century inscription copied from the original medieval parchment and dating the Church to 559 A.D. The church is located in the parish seat of Cedofeita, placing it in an urbanized environment with intense traffic, surrounded by a small garden, alongside the newer parochial church of Cedofeita (a church of grand dimensions that was constructed in the 1970s). Composed of a single nave and rectangular chancel, the structure of the apse church is designed around a barrel vault in articulated spaces covered by a tiled-roof typical in Portugal.Gerhard N. Graf (1986), vol.1, p.331Carlos Almeida (2001), p.116 The principal facade (oriented to the west) is marked by a single portico with three semi-circular arches, decorated with animals and birds, supported on rounded-columns. This triumphal arch entrance-way, is constructed over two limestone capitals and has a cubic appearance, extending from the main facade of the church. Many of the decorations are thought to be reused elements from an older building, likely from a Suebi-Visigothic construction (and has been the centre of historical speculation since the 17th century). The triumphal arch is surmounted by a Romanesque slit-window, flanked by rounded capitals, and finally surmounted by a Neolithic cross on its apex. Within the cantilever tympanum there is an inscription dating to 1767. Over the northern corner of the church is a belfry aligned west-to-east, designed in two Romanesque arches, and holding the bells. Owing to the barrel ceiling within the nave, the church facades are reinforced with lateral exterior buttresses (some staggered examples are not original to the main building and may have been added in the 17th‚Äì18th century). These large buttresses support the lateral facades and are interspersed by cornices. The south facade has a single portico with semi-circular archway, comparable to the principal facade but in a smaller scale (but with four columns on capitals and with bird and flower motifs). Meanwhile, the northern portico has a similar design, but with other motifs on the capitals, and the tympanum is identifiable by a sculpted Agnus Dei.Manuel Lu√≠s Real (1974), p.165 The main chapel has a series of blind arches on the wall (a remnant from the earlier, 11th century building) and is illuminated by three narrow windows. Two capitals of the triumphal arch (between the main chapel and the nave) were reused from an ancient building, possibly a 10th-century church in this same spot. These capitals, with sculptured vegetation motifs, are made of sandstone from the Coimbra region, which contrasts with the dark granite of the rest of the building. The nave is illuminated by the narrow windows on the nave and main facade and by a small rose window on the wall over the main chapel. Inserted into the wall is a Gothic inscription. It is likely that intervention of Coimbra sandstone marks the importance of this temple for Art History: the phenomenon that developed from the dispersion of Coimbra's influence into the Romanesque churches can be seen the similarities to buildings such as the S√© and Church of Santiago. The themes used to decorate the capitals reveal a transposition of Coimbran models, such as the use of carved birds, lions, while the tympanum, Agnus Dei and vegetable decoration continue many of the similar treatments.Manuel Lu√≠s Real (1986), vol.1, p.60Manuel Lu√≠s Real (1974) p.165 Notes Sources    * Roman Catholic churches in Porto Romanesque architecture in Portugal National monuments in Porto District ","title":"Church of S√£o Martinho de Cedofeita"},{"id":"6400662","text":"Saint Joseph of Cupertino Parish is a territorial parish serving Latin Rite Catholics in Cupertino, California, United States.

Car accident omen Some drivers believe that a new car is in greater danger than a used car of getting into an accident or having a collision. Some drivers will leave change under their seats. Others use one coin to scratch the car, based on the (false) belief that since the car is new and nothing has happened to it yet, the chances of something bad happening to the car is greater when compared to a used car which already has its fair share of dents and scratches. In hopes of preventing a high damaging accident, they will place a small nick or scratch on the car in an area where it will not be seen. The inside of the wheel well is one commonly scratched area. There are also a few practices associated with graduations. In the days leading up to a graduation, some drivers (and in some cases friends of the driver) will write on the car windows with washable paint. The messages usually congratulate the driver of the car and list the driver‚Äôs school and year of graduation. After graduating from high school or college, some drivers choose to hang their tassel from the rearview mirror. Some people throw change under a bed in hopes of bringing good luck to the new home. Change is known world wide as a good luck charm. Mourning Car decked with flags Religious There are also religious acts that are associated with automobiles. This can include getting the car blessed by a cleric or placing an object of religious significance inside the car. A predominately Roman Catholic practice is to place a medal of Saint Christopher, the patron saint of truck drivers and travelers in general,‚ÄúSaint Christopher‚Äú Saints.SQPN.com.

An ancient legend, mentioned by Erasmus in the Praise of Folly, holds that those who see an image of Saint Christopher cannot die through misadventure during that day. Not surprisingly, images of Saint Christopher became popular automobile accessories. Through the presence of the medal, the driver is asking the Saint to pray on his or her behalf for a safe and uneventful journey. A somewhat more sombre purpose originally stood behind the familiar plastic Jesus that some Christians have mounted on their dashboards. The original plastic Jesus was circulated by the Sacred Heart Auto League, founded in 1955 by Father Gregory Bezy, SCJ. This devotional society placed the traditional Roman Catholic figure of Jesus displaying his Sacred Heart on the dashboard. Father Bezy was moved to do this as a \\"practical answer to what he considered the ever-increasing dangers of our overcrowded streets and highways.\\"Sacred Heart Auto League, official site. (Accessed 8/12/06) In other words, in the event of a fatal accident, Father Bezy hoped that the last thing the riders would see would be the image of Jesus, and as such face Eternity with faith and contrition. The plastic dashboard Jesus proved popular among non-Catholic Christians as well. The figure is well known enough to have inspired a folk song Plastic Jesus, originally attributed to Ed Rush and George Cromarty, which has acquired many anonymous folk variants. One frequent set of verses has it open: :I don't care if it rains or freezes Long as I got my Plastic Jesus Riding on the dashboard of my car. :Through my trials and tribulations And my travels through the nations With my Plastic Jesus I'll go far.Plastic Jesus lyrics and chords. (Accessed 8/12/06) Some Catholics will also hang rosary beads from their rearview mirror. Catholics and other Christians may also hang crosses or crucifixes from the rearview mirror. Cars for special occasions Wedding Transport Cars are often decorated, and have wishes written on them, and various streamers or trailing objects attached, in celebrations of weddings and graduations. Hearse Limousine A frequent wedding tradition in the United States involves the decoration of the vehicle the bride and groom drive take at the conclusion of the wedding ceremony. Typically, various ribbons and streamers are attached, and words written upon the surface of the vehicle, and often tin cans are attached to its fenders or bumpers by strings to serve as noisemakers. Jan Brunvand's American Folklore: An Encyclopedia speculates that the decoration of the car and its equipment with noisemakers may perpetuate the shivaree, a custom in which newlyweds were given a noisy serenade; when honeymoon travel became a custom, it made a traditional local shivaree impractical, so the vehicle is given a noisy sendoff instead.Jan Brunvand, American Folklore: An Encyclopedia (Garland, 1988) . (\\"Weddings\\") Some cars are used chiefly for special occasions and social rituals, such as limousines. Truck drivers and taxicab drivers Trucks and Truck Drivers CB Radio Various professions revolving around motor vehicles acquire a folklore of their own. Truck drivers, since they tend to work in isolation, tend to develop a social network of their own. They circulate a number of tall tales that relate generally to their profession, usually involving the outwitting of state police and other traffic or tax authorities. They also create an elaborate body of customs and lore surrounding the use of citizen's band radio, with its own jargon and \\"handles\\", which came to national notice in the 1970s. A widespread bit of popular folklore circulated among other motorists that truck drivers knew which restaurants to patronize and which to avoid, so eateries that were obviously frequented by truck drivers were esteemed by the general public. With the arise of national restaurant chains, this bit of folklore is fading.Jan Brunvand, American Folklore: An Encyclopedia (Garland, 1988) . (\\"Truck drivers\\") Similar folklore surrounds taxicab drivers, involving the tales they tell among each other, and the tales that circulate about them. Taxicab Car coining There is a practice in New Jersey and New York of tossing a few coins onto the floor of a newly purchased car as a sign of good luck. This practice originated as a practical one. Because of the area's many toll roads, many drivers would carry change in their cars. The friends and family of the new car owner would throw coins onto the floor of the new car so if the driver ever ran out of their own money, they could always reach down and find some extra money on the floor.

It is set in blanket peatland on the north-west upper slopes of Musherabeg mountain and is thought to be 3500 years old. Environment The mid-Cork area is rich in archaeological artifacts, and the surrounding townlands contain two cashels, a ringfort, two fulacht fiadh, a possible souterrain and a circular enclosure. The word Knocknakilla is derived from the Irish Cnoc na Cille, as 'The Hill of the Church'. Description Nearby Wedge tomb at Glantane The site is located is on a level patch of bogland overlooking a deep valley and comprises a recumbent stone circle, a radial cairn and two pointy portal stones (one of which has fallen), aligned north-northeast to south-southwest. The stone circle is made up of five 1.3- to 1.5-metre-high stones, of which two (the axis and east sidestone) fell sometime in the last 50 years. Only the two northern portal stones and a stone at the west stand today. The stone row, made up of two stones both over 3.5 metres tall, seems to have been aligned on the stone circle, although the stone nearest the circle has fallen, and the remaining stone has a pronounced lean. Three meters away is a 10-stone, 3.5-metre-diameter, radial cairn which was first discovered by Coillte Teoranta in 1970. The upright standing stone is 3.7 metres tall, and it leans heavily to the north. Knocknakilla is best known for its large phallic, now leaning, portal stone.

These are often cheaply made in China and are limited to only an up-and-down motion, and are incapable of the 3 different movements characteristic of authentic Flip Flaps. The fake and real versions look extremely similar, but consumers can differentiate between the two by looking for the Tomy logo, almost entirely Japanese characters on the box (limited English), and dark green leaves (fake Flip Flaps have light green leaves, as opposed to the darker, real ones of slightly better quality).

After the war he gradually progressed from working as a film critic, to screenwriting, to becoming a director Like many Italian cult directors, Sollima started his career as a screenwriter in the 1950s and wrote many peplum films in the 1960s. He made his directing debut doing one of the four sequences in the anthology film Of Wayward Love. Sollima filmed three Eurospy films then moved to spaghetti westerns. The Big Gundown (starring Lee Van Cleef and Tomas Milian) was released in 1966 with big success, despite the fact that it had to compete with Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Sergio Corbucci's Django. Sollima soon filmed two more westerns. Face to Face (Milian and Gian Maria Volont√©) was released in 1967 and Run, Man, Run! (Milian) in 1968. Although Sollima directed only three westerns and they never reached the level of popularity as the ones by the other Sergios (Leone and Corbucci), each of them is highly regarded among genre enthusiasts. In 1970, Sollima switched genres again and directed the Charles Bronson and Telly Savalas starred Violent City, which was one of the first violent and fast-paced Italian crime films often known as poliziotteschi. Like for all of his westerns, the soundtrack was provided by Ennio Morricone. Sollima's last well- known film is Revolver, a poliziotteschi film starring Oliver Reed and Fabio Testi.

Founded in 1856, it is the second oldest continuously operating elementary school in California and serves families of the Diocese of San Jose. Saint Clare School was founded in 1856 by the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur and is located adjacent to Santa Clara University (formerly Santa Clara College). It is part of the Drexel Schools system, an initiative launched by the Diocese of San Jose to promote high quality Catholic education.  History  In 1856 the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur who came to create one of the earliest school systems in California founded St. Mary's School to educate elementary age students in the parish. It was located next to Mission Santa Clara and the recently built Santa Clara College (1851) founded by the Jesuits. St. Mary's was later renamed Notre Dame Academy. The school started in the Forbes house located on the city block bordered by Lexington St, Santa Clara St, Lafayette St. and Washington St. The sisters also founded the College of Notre Dame, which split to become the present-day Notre Dame High School and Notre Dame de Namur University. Notre Dame High School is the sister school of the Jesuit- run boys' school Santa Clara Prep, now known as Bellarmine College Preparatory. In 1924 Saint Clare moved across the street into a brand new school building that housed Kindergarten through eighth grade. A Marble Plaque on the front of the school proclaims \\"DEO OPTIMO MAXIMO IN HONREM SANCTAE CLARAE XXI OCTOBRIS A.D. MCMXXIV DEDICATA\\" which translates to \\"To the greatest and best God in honor of St. Clare. Dedicated October 21st, 1924.\\" The following year Saint Clare Parish is built on the site of the original brick school next to Sodality Hall (later renamed St Clare Hall). Unfortunately, a fire in 1926 destroyed the original 96-year-old Mission Santa Clara. The school continued to grow and was in dire need of space. In 1952 school raised $138,000 to build a new convent for the teaching sisters located across from the school at 725 Washington Street in Santa Clara, freeing up more classroom space. This building is now the St. Clare Parish Offices. As the enrollment demand increased at Saint Clare, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco authorized the opening of nearby St. Martin School in 1955 and St. Justin School in 1958. On August 7, 1958 a new building for the junior high school was built across Washington street from the school, next door to the St. Clare convent. After more than 150 years of ministry, the Sisters transferred control of the school to lay leadership staff in 1998.

It was serialized by Kodansha in Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine and collected in 11 bound volumes. The manga was licensed in North America by Tokyopop, but the license was dropped after publishing 10 volumes. The story centers on a Japanese pop-singing group called Beatmen and focuses on the life of Rin Amami, the unlikely fifth member of the group who was foretold as the bearer of a legendary unique singing vocal called 'Dragon Voice'. Story The main character is 15-year-old Rin Amami, a gifted street dancer. His dream was to become a singer like his mother, but he has a harsh and unpleasant-sounding voice. However, his chance encounter with the idol singing group Beatmen opens the path to the music industry to him. The head of the small idol agency called Redshoes (who manages the Beatmen) is certain that Rin's voice is the legendary 'Dragon Voice.' The Beatmen Rin Amami Rin is a good-looking and smart-mouthed street dancer. He can remember and copy any dance routine just by watching them once. He started out as a teenager who dislikes boybands. Ironically, Rin's hidden desire is to be a singer like his late mother, but decided to give up his dreams because of his bad voice, which was often referred by his schoolmates to 'resemble the voice of a bullfrog'. Shino Shino is the kind and responsible leader of the pop-singing group. Very professional, he often pushes himself hard at work even though he has an asthmatic condition. He is the most enthusiastic and optimistic member of the group. He acts as the \\"glue that sticks the Beatmen together\\". Yuhgo Etoh Yuhgo is the often quiet member of The Beatmen. He's been involved in the music industry since he was very young. He occasionally writes lyrics, and is the most technologically adept member of the group. His straight attitude sometimes make people think of him as being arrogant, though it is mostly because of his difficulty in expressing his own feelings.

The majority of the TPLF leadership held dual membership in the MLLT, including Meles Zenawi, Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia from 1995 until his death in 2012. According to a 1986 article in the League's publication, The People's Voice, the MLLT was first established in 1983 as \\"pre-party organization\\" called the Organization of the Vanguard Elements. This grouping would become the MLLT in 1985 to serve as a \\"vanguard party for the TPLF\\". According to Aregawi Berhe, the MLLT held its founding congress on 25 July 1985 in the gorge of the Wari River.Aregawi Berhe, A Political history of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (1975-1991) (Los Angeles: Tsehai, 2009), p. 170 Posing as orthodox defenders of Marxism-Leninism and allying itself with the communist current associated with the hard-line Enver Hoxha regime in Albania, the MLLT saw its goals as spreading Marxism-Leninism throughout the world and \\"engaging in a bitter struggle against all brands of revisionism,\\" which they defined using the parlance of the Albanian Labor Party, as including \\"Khrushchevism, Titoism, Trotskyism, Euro-Communism and Maoism.\\" The emergence of the MLLT created some rifts with the Eritrean People's Liberation Front with which the TPLF was allied against the ruling Soviet-backed Ethiopian Derg. The MLLT took a much harder line on the role of the Soviet Union in the world, which they along with Albania viewed as social-imperialist and an enemy of the oppressed of the world. The EPLF held a more flexible line viewing the Soviet support for the Derg as a tactical mistake on their part and avoided any public denunciations of the Soviet Union. With the coming to power of the TPLF in 1991 and the collapse of communist regime in Albania, the TPLF dropped all references to Marxism-Leninism. The leadership of the TPLF claims that the MLLT dissolved when the TPLF-backed Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front took power after the collapse of the Ethiopian Democratic People's Republic in 1991. While many current TPLF leaders downplay or minimize the influence of MLLT on the TPLF, it is clear that it played a major leadership role in the TPLF for most of its existence. Some scholars (such as Kahsay Berhe) believe the MLLT played a role in the removal of TPLF founders Giday Zera Tsion and Aregawi Berhe in late July 1985.  Notes  References *Young, John.

She was primarily known for her recurring role in the first three seasons of ER as nurse Wendy Goldman, as well as her role as Ana Delgado in the 1988 teacher drama Stand and Deliver. Career Marquez appeared in a 1992 episode of Seinfeld called \\"The Cheever Letters\\", portraying a secretary in the Cuban Permanent Mission (the US and Cuba did not have mutual embassies from 1961 to 2015). Her success with Stand and Deliver led to a full-fledged career in film and television, with roles in the gangster epic Blood In Blood Out (1993) and the independent film Twenty Bucks (1993). Her television work included guest spots on popular programs, including Melrose Place (1992) and recurring roles on ER (1994-1997) and Malcolm & Eddie (1996). In addition to her acting credentials, Marquez appeared as a singer in the 2000 film Under Suspicion. Personal life Mental illness Marquez appeared in an early episode of the A&E; Network reality television series Intervention, as she tried to manage her shopping addiction. Marquez was given an ‚Äúintervention‚Äù by friends to get her to go to treatment (she later said that her treatment was not successful). She had serious mental health issues, including bipolar disorder and agoraphobia, that ended her career as an actress and left her almost entirely homebound. Prior to her death, Marquez made headlines related to the #MeToo movement, alleging that she endured harassment while on the set of ER. In October 2017, she accused series star George Clooney of helping to \\"blacklist\\" her after she complained to executives about the harassment. Clooney denied the allegations.  Death  Marquez's death occurred during an incident on August 30, 2018, at her home in South Pasadena, California, where a wellness check by local authorities led to an armed confrontation. Vanessa's home was found in a state of disarray and she claimed to be experiencing a seizure, for which paramedics and a mental health expert were called to evaluate her. Marquez was shot and killed by police after she pointed a firearm and advanced toward the officers, who had retreated down the stairs after initially seeing the firearm. The firearm was later determined to be a BB gun. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has ruled that the police officers had acted in \\"lawful self-defense\\" in the shooting. In February 2019, attorneys representing her mother filed a wrongful death claim against the City of South Pasadena, California. The claim alleges battery, negligence, unlawful entry, false arrest and imprisonment, wrongful death, negligent training, conspiracy, seizure of property, failure to summon prompt medical care and violation of the Bane Act (which forbids acts of violence because of race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, etc). In March 2020, the South Pasadena Police released bodycam footage from the incident, where Marquez pleaded to the officers to kill her, as well as pointing the BB gun at officers.

He overcomes this by learning to play the trumpet.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film scored a 15% 'Rotten' rating. The site's critical consensus says \\"An uninspired E.B. White adaptation that's targeted at the very young.\\" Box office It failed to get an audience at the box office for two reasons: 1. A small limited release, and 2. Because of the release of DreamWorks' animated hit Shrek the following week which would cause the film to lose most of its potential audience. By the end of its run, the film grossed a mere $102,202. Awards and nominations In 2001, it was nominated by the Casting Society of America for best voice-casting in an animated film, but lost the award to Disney's The Emperor's New Groove. It is notable, however, that an independent animated film would be able to win such a nomination. It was the last film based on a book by E. B. White until 2006's Charlotte's Web.

It was unanimously approved by the United Nations Security Council on 11 August 2006. The Lebanese cabinet unanimously approved the resolution on 12 August 2006. On the same day, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said that his militia would honor the call for a ceasefire. He also said that once the Israeli offensive stops, Hezbollah's rocket attacks on Israel would stop. On 13 August the Israeli Cabinet voted 24‚Äì0 in favor of the resolution, with one abstention. The ceasefire began on Monday, 14 August 2006 at 8 AM local time, after increased attacks by both sides. In the UN's 2015 report on the matter, it states that: > The situation in the area of operations of the United Nations Interim Force > in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and along the Blue Line remained generally calm, despite > the tense regional context and following the serious breach of the cessation > of hostilities between Lebanon and Israel on 28 January. Overall, despite > escalatory rhetoric on both sides, the Lebanese and Israeli authorities > displayed resolve to maintain calm along the Blue Line, continued to engage > constructively with UNIFIL through the established liaison and coordination > arrangements and reaffirmed their commitment to the implementation of > resolution 1701 (2006). There was no progress, however, on their outstanding > obligations under the resolution and no movement towards a permanent > ceasefire. Resolution The resolution calls for:UN Security Council Resolution 1701 * Full cessation of hostilities (OP1) * Israel to withdraw all of its forces from Lebanon in parallel with Lebanese and UNIFIL soldiers deploying throughout the South (OP2) * A long term solution based on (OP8) ** Disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon (implying Hezbollah) **No armed forces other than UNIFIL and Lebanese (implying Hezbollah and Israeli forces) will be south of the Litani River ** No foreign forces in Lebanon without the consent of its government ** Provision to the United Nations of all maps of land mines in Lebanon in Israel's possession The Resolution at the same time also emphasizes: * The importance of full control of Lebanon by the government of Lebanon (OP3) * The need to address urgently the unconditional release of the abducted Israeli soldiers, that have given rise to the current crisis. The resolution also reiterates the Security Council's strong support for * Full respect for the Blue Line (OP 4) * The territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized borders (OP 5) Disarmament of armed groups in Lebanon The Resolution calls for \\"full implementation of the relevant provisions of the Taif Accords, and of resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1680 (2006), that require the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon, so that, pursuant to the Lebanese cabinet decision of July 27, 2006, there will be no weapons or authority in Lebanon other than that of the Lebanese state.\\" Hezbollah Hezbollah came into existence in 1985 as a result of the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon which began in 1982 and lasted until 2000. On 14 August, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said on Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV that he is not in favor of Hezbollah's disarmament, since the Lebanese army is not strong enough to defend Lebanon and the Israeli army is still occupying Lebanon, and that his fighters would not be forced to disarm by \\"intimidation or pressure.\\" Similarly, after adoption of the resolution Lebanese Defence Minister Elias Murr said on 14 August 2006, in a television interview that \\"the army won't be deployed to south Lebanon to disarm Hezbollah.\\" Soon after the resolution's passage, both the UN and UNIFIL contributing nations such as France disclaimed responsibility for disarming Hezbollah. Annan asserted that \\"dismantling Hezbollah is not the direct mandate of the UN,\\" which could only help Lebanon disarm the organization. Annan then said on 25 August 2006, \\"The understanding was that it would be the Lebanese who would disarm [Hezbollah]\\" and that \\"Obviously, if at some stage they need advice or some help from the international community and they were to approach us, we would consider it, but the troops are not going in there to disarm.\\" Israel, for its part, indicated that if Hezbollah is not disarmed as called for in the Resolution, Israel would continue their efforts. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev told the Associated Press on 18 August that Israel is keeping its commitments in the UN ceasefire resolution and expects Lebanon to do the same. \\"That resolution clearly calls for the creation of a Hezbollah-free zone south of the Litani River, and anything less would mean that the resolution is not being implemented,\\" Regev told AP. Hezbollah agreed to disarm its forces south of the Litani River, but not to pull its forces out of southern Lebanon. \\"Hezbollah individuals are people who live in the south and they will not leave their homes and villages, but an armed Hezbollah will not be in the south,\\" said Mohamad Chatah on 16 August, a senior adviser to Lebanese Prime Minister Siniora. UN Resolution 1701 prohibits all armed militias from operating anywhere in all of Lebanon (\\"no weapons or authority in Lebanon other than that of the Lebanese state\\" and \\"full implementation of the relevant provisions of the Taif Accords, and of resolutions 1559 and 1680, that require the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon, so that, pursuant to the Lebanese cabinet decision of 27 July 2006, there will be no weapons or authority in Lebanon other than that of the Lebanese State\\"), but does not specify whether the militias should disarm or be put under the control of the Lebanese government. United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, who said that the \\"ball is now in the court of the government of Lebanon\\" to ensure no armed militias operate in southern Lebanon. On 21 August, the Turkish newspaper H√ºrriyet reported that Turkish authorities intercepted five Iranian cargo aircraft and one Syrian aircraft carrying missiles to Hezbollah. The aircraft were forced to land at Diyarbakƒ±r Airport in southeastern Turkey. The aircraft were not allowed to take off after US intelligence sources found there were three missile launchers and crates of C-802 missiles on board the planes which were identical to the missile that struck the Israeli Navy Ship \\"Hanit\\" during the war. Israeli Defense Minister Amir Peretz said that Israel would continue to prevent weapons from reaching Hezbollah from Syria and Iran. \\"I will not allow the situation that happened before the war to return,\\" said Peretz during a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul. He also asked that Turkey send troops to the international force deploying in Lebanon. In January 2007, Israeli military intelligence chief Maj.-Gen. Amos Yadlin criticized both Hezbollah for rearming and the United Nations for \\"doing nothing to prevent it or disarm them.\\" via The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles. 12 January 2007. Fatah The Lebanese government demanded that Palestinians in refugee camps in the Litani area disarm in accordance with the resolution, senior Fatah operative in Lebanon, Monir Al-Makdah, said on 28 August 2006. Reportedly, Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora \\"made the request to Fatah representative in Lebanon, Abbas Za'aki. Al-Makdah rejected the demand in an interview with Jordanian newspaper Al-Dostur, saying that the Security Council resolution was illegal since it did not include the right of return for Palestinian refugees.\\"Report: Hizbullah razes 14 Shaba posts Jerusalem Post. 28 August 2006 New UN troops for UNIFIL II On 30 June 2006, UNIFIL was made up of 1,990 troops from China, France, Ghana, India, Ireland, Italy, Poland, and Ukraine, supported by 50 military observers from UN Truce Supervision Organization and about 400 civilian staff members. As of 8 January 2007, UNIFIL has grown to 11,512 military personnel from the following nations: Belgium (375; 394 pledged), China (190), Denmark (78, warships; 150 pledged), Finland (205), France (2,000), Germany (1,500, surveillance ships and planes; 2,400 pledged), Ghana (660), Greece (225), Guatemala (1), Hungary (4), India (878), Indonesia (850), Ireland (164), Italy (2,415; commands UNIFIL forces), Luxembourg (2), Malaysia (220; 360 pledged), Nepal (234), Netherlands (161), Norway (134), Poland (319), Portugal (146, military construction engineers), Qatar (200), Slovenia (11), Spain (1,277, armored vehicles), South Korea (270 special forces pledged, 80 support personnel pledged), Sweden (68, and a ship), Turkey (509), and Ukraine (200), supported by 53 military observers from UN Truce Supervision Organization and about 308 local civilian staff members. Other countries have been reported as willing to send troops, but have not shared troop numbers. They include: Australia, Bangladesh, Bulgaria (160 frigate crew members), Latvia, Lithuania, Morocco, New Zealand, Russia (400) and Thailand. Israel indicated that it is not in favor of troops being included from countries that have offered to send troops but do not recognize Israel as a state, such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Deployment of UNIFIL II The Resolution, in Paragraph 2, \\"calls upon the Government of Lebanon and UNIFIL as authorized by paragraph 11 to deploy their forces together throughout the South.\\" Paragraph 11 then states that Security Council decided: \\"that the [UNIFIL II] force shall, in addition to carrying out its mandate under resolutions 425 and 426 (1978): ... (b) Accompany and support the Lebanese armed forces as they deploy throughout the South, including along the Blue Line ... (c) Coordinate its activities related to paragraph 11(b) with the Government of Lebanon and the Government of Israel ....\\" Complicating matters, Syria threatened to close their border with Lebanon if UN troops were sent in. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad also warned that deploying foreign troops along the border would be a \\"hostile\\" act against Syria. \\"At the moment we are seeing some very unconstructive signals from Syria,\\" Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel said. As for the UN's position, however, Annan advanced the view afterward that the resolution did not require the UN to deploy UNIFIL II anywhere unless invited to do so by the Lebanese government. He said on 25 August, however: \\"the resolution does not require deployment of UN troops to the [Syria]n border. It indicates that, if the Lebanese government were to ask for it, we should assist. The Lebanese Government has not made any such request.\\" Background This resolution was based on an initial draft prepared by France and the United States. Lebanon and the Arab League pressed to have parts of the Siniora Plan, which required Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon, included in the final resolution. 6‚Äì8 August Lebanon's Prime Minister Fouad Siniora said on 6 August that the draft resolution was \\"not adequate,\\" and House Speaker Nabih Berri, serving as a diplomatic conduit for Hezbollah, rejected the draft. The draft made no mention of Israeli forces withdrawing from Lebanon. Lebanon proposed on 7 August that it would send 15,000 troops to its southern border if Israeli troops would leave the country, handing over their positions to the UN Interim Force. The draft UN resolution called for \\"the immediate cessation by Hezbollah of all attacks and the immediate cessation by Israel of all offensive military operations.\\" A second resolution would later establish an international peacekeeping force that would help Lebanon's army take control of the country's southern border, where Hezbollah had held sway since the Israeli withdrawal in 2000. The resolution stated that Israeli forces shall withdraw in parallel with the deployment of Lebanese and UNIFIL forces into the southern Lebanon, and established that the Lebanese government should have control over all Lebanese territory, and that \\"there will be no weapons without the consent of the government of Lebanon and no authority other than that of the government of Lebanon.\\" On 8 August, several changes were made to the proposal. Lebanon and its Arab League allies pressed the UN to call for an immediate Israeli withdrawal. Such a withdrawal had not been mentioned in the draft resolution; an omission that Lebanon's government and Arab League diplomats called unacceptable. The Lebanese proposal also called for Israel to temporarily give control of Shebaa Farms to the UN. 9‚Äì11 August Dan Gillerman, Israel's Ambassador to the UN, said he had problems with the idea of a UN force being deployed to stabilize the region, and pointed to the UN Interim Force in Lebanon as an example. Israel's Security Cabinet recommended that the Israeli military expand its campaign against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.. Diplomats at the UN and in Beirut stepped up efforts to secure a UN resolution. 12 August Despite the expanded ground campaign, the Israeli Security Cabinet was likely to sign off on the UN resolution at its meeting on 13 August, Israel's Ambassador to the US, Daniel Ayalon, said before the Council vote. A final text of the resolution was distributed to the full UN Security Council, which unanimously accepted the resolution. The resolution demands a full cessation of all hostilities, the release of abducted Israeli soldiers, the deployment of 15,000 international troops to police the Lebanon- Israel border‚Äîan increase from the then-current 2,000. The UN troops in the area would be joined by 15,000 Lebanese troops. The deal also calls for the release of two Israeli soldiers whose capture by guerrillas sparked the conflict. Tzipi Livni, Israel‚Äôs foreign minister, insisted that Israeli troops would remain in southern Lebanon until a multinational UN force is deployed, implying that deployment of Lebanese forces would not be sufficient for Israeli withdrawal. Initial reactions Leaders around the world praised the agreement, while noting this was not the end of the crisis. The Lebanese cabinet voted unanimously to accept the terms on 12 August. Nasrallah, in a speech televised on Hezbollah's Al-Manar television on 12 August, said: \\"We will not be an obstacle to any decision taken by the Lebanese government\\". The Israeli government accepted the terms on 13 August, but did not cease offensive actions until its deadline at 8:00 a.m. (local time) 14 August. On 13 August, Israel advanced to capture as much high-ground territory as possible before the ceasefire, and bombed targets up to 15 minutes before the deadline. Hezbollah also continued what they called \\"defensive operations,\\" and vowed not to cease their operations as long as Israel occupies Lebanon.\\"Truce Allows Thousands of Lebanese to Return Home\\", New York Times, 14 August 2006 The French government criticized the rules of engagement. \\"I remember the unhappy experiences of other operations where UN forces had neither a sufficiently precise mission nor the means to act,\\" French Defence Minister, Mich√®le Alliot-Marie, said. \\"You cannot send out men and tell them that they should watch what's happening but that they have no right to defend themselves or fire.\\" Aftermath In the UN's 2015 report on the matter, it states that: > The situation in the area of operations of the United Nations Interim Force > in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and along the Blue Line remained generally calm, despite > the tense regional context and following the serious breach of the cessation > of hostilities between Lebanon and Israel on 28 January.

It states that \\"Israeli violations of Lebanese airspace continued almost daily with unmanned aerial vehicles, and often with fixed-wing aircraft, including fighter jets\\". On the Lebanese side, it noted: \\"In accordance with its mandate, UNIFIL does not proactively search for weapons in the south\\" and \\"UNIFIL observed civilians with unauthorized weapons in the area of operation...Those mostly involved individuals carrying hunting weapons. However, there were a number of instances where small arms, including rifles and, at least on one occasion, rocket-propelled grenades, were fired during commemorative events, including funerals\\". It also noted: \\"The maintenance of arms by Hizbullah and other groups outside the control of the Lebanese State\\" violates the resolution. Hizbullah states that such weaponry \\"serves as a deterrent against potential aggression from Israel\\". In 2011, following the appointment of Najib Mikati as Prime Minister of Lebanon, the United Nations reiterated its call on Lebanon to adhere to the terms of Resolution 1701. Alleged Hezbollah violations As of February 2009, many key points in the resolution remained insufficiently addressed. In a special report, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon mentions that \\"Hezbollah continues to refuse to provide any information on the release or fate of abducted soldiers, and places conditions and demands for the release that are far outside the scope of resolution 1701,\\" Ban wrote in the report. The report also points out that Hezbollah has replenished its stock of rockets and missiles in South Lebanon, and is now in possession of 10,000 long-range rockets and 20,000 short-range projectiles. Alleged Israeli violations The Lebanese government claims that Israel has violated the resolution over 7,000 times \\"by crossing Lebanese airspace,\\" waters, and border on an almost daily basis since the implementation of the resolution. Alleged Lebanese violations In 2009, Israel filed a complaint with the U.N. that Lebanon was not complying with the resolution after a Katyusha rocket was fired from Lebanon and landed next to a house in northern Israel and injured three people. The complaint affirmed Israel's right to defend itself and its citizens. Later in 2009, when weapons that Hezbollah was hiding in a civilian home in a Lebanese town near the border of Israel exploded, both Israel and UNIFIL complained that Resolution 1701 was being violated by Lebanon and Hezbollah. The IDF estimates that the number of civilian homes in southern Lebanon that are being used to store weapons are in the hundreds.\\"UNIFIL: Lebanese arms cache a 'serious violation' of ceasefire.\\" Jerusalem Post. 15 July 2009. 15 July 2009. Israel also criticized the Lebanese army, which is responsible for enforcing the resolution, for cooperating with Hezbollah in making sure that the evidence of the violation of the resolution had been cleared up before allowing U.N. peace keepers to do their job.\\"Lebanon army covering for Hezbollah, Israel claims.\\" JTA. 17 July 2009. 17 July 2009. Two days later, fifteen Lebanese civilians from Kfar Shuba, carrying Lebanese and Hizbullah flags, crossed into the Israeli occupied Shebaa Farms. The IDF took no action to the provocation, but stressed that it was a violation of Resolution 1701. The United Nations confirmed that Hezbollah violated the resolution and that the group is rearming.

Hudson Building (\\"Hudson's\\") was a department store located at 1206 Woodward Avenue in downtown Detroit, Michigan. It was constructed beginning in 1911, with additions throughout the years, before being \\"completed\\" in 1946, and named after the company's founder, Joseph Lowthian Hudson. Hudson's first building on the site opened in 1891 but was demolished in 1923 for a new structure. It was the flagship store for the Hudson's chain. The building was demolished in a controlled demolition on October 24, 1998, with many people watching from Hart Plaza (Detroit) and Dieppe Gardens (Windsor, Ontario). It was the tallest building ever imploded. The structure Designed by Smith, Hinchman, & Grylls, Hudson's consisted of approximately 33 levels: five basements, main floor, mezzanine, 2nd through 15th floors, 15 1/2 floor, 16th through 21st floors, 21 1/2 floor, and 22nd through 25th floors. Only the upper two basements through the 12th floor covered the entire footprint of the structure. A tower rose over 400 feet above the Farmer Street side. On all four sides, porcelain-covered copper letters spelled \\"HUDSON'S\\" in red neon. A window of the J.L. Hudson Building Hudson's boasted about 2.2 million sq. ft. of retail and office space, included several restaurants and was built in the Chicago School architectural style. The facade was red brick above the second floor. Below that, it consisted of polished pink granite panels. Terra-cotta cornices and rosettes were extensively employed, along with ornamental ironwork. \\"JLH\\"-emblazoned ovals decorated frosted windows on the mezzanine and 3rd through 5th floors. The building measured tall from its second basement to the top of the penthouse tower. It was also topped by a high flagpole. The store closed January 17, 1983 (at the nadir of downtown Detroit's decline). After closure, Hudson's maintained its headquarters staff of about 1,100 in the downtown store. In May 1984, The J.L. Hudson Co. formally merged into the Department Store Division of the Dayton Hudson Corp., although Hudson's stores continued to carry the Hudson's name. All executive and buying positions transferred to Minneapolis, and other staff moved to space at the Northland Center store in Southfield. The last corporate department in the downtown Detroit building, credit operations, moved in October 1986. Dayton Hudson sold the building in December 1989. Hudson's was demolished by Controlled Demolition, Inc. at exactly 5:47 pm EST on October 24, 1998. 20,000 people watched as the building was imploded -- turning it into a tall pile of debris. The demolition shattered windows on many then- still-abandoned retail buildings across Woodward Avenue, created a large debris and dust cloud that shrouded many parts of downtown Detroit as far south as Jefferson Avenue in dust (including thousands of people and vehicles) and accidentally damaged a section of the elevated Detroit People Mover. The city constructed a 955-spot, four-level Underground parking garage at the site using parts of the basement of the demolished tower in 2001. Future In November 2013, Bedrock Detroit, who would be granted development rights of the two-acre city-owned site, hired New York-based SHoP Architects and Detroit- based Hamilton Anderson Associates to lead the design process of redevelopment on the site. Bedrock broke ground on the development on December 14, 2017; the plans include a tower of 62 stories and and a mid-rise building of 14 stories. The project is expected to open in 2022.

The conflict goes back to the workers revolution and age of unionized labor in the late nineteenth century. Since the 1870s and the rise of professionalism, the daily routine of American workers has been largely designed by professionals instead of foremen. Today, most American workers -many of whom earn middle- range incomes and work in white-collar occupations ‚Äì are usually not resentful of the professionals, though a feeling of disconnect persists. Even nowadays there is a large visible discrepancy between professionals whose main job duties include visualizing and directing the day of other workers and those who carry out the orders. While the work of professionals and managers is usually largely self-directed and appeals to the interest of the individual, that of middle-range income white-collar and blue-collar workers is closely supervised and tends to greatly stray from the worker's actual interests. Yet another reason for resentment toward the professional middle class on the part of the working class stems from the embedded feelings of anti-intellectualism. When combined working class workers seem to often be under the impression that their better paid, professional managers are not actually \\"doing anything\\" as most of their duties are to conceptualize and outline their ideas. The student movement In the 1960s, tensions between classes flared up again. The student protestors, many of whom had deferments and were therefore exempt from fighting in the Vietnam War, were generally the youth of the professional middle class. Though the student protestors envisioned solidarity with the working class as a means of opposing \\"establishment\\" policies with regard to war, race, and other social issues, the student protestors' lack of support for the Vietnam War, as well as generalized antipathy toward youthful rebellion, alienated the working classes. Current disconnect In modern-day America, a common view among some members of the working class or less privileged members of the statistical middle class is that while the professional middle class is paid better, they are less directly involved in the production of goods and services than those of the working class. This difference in pay coupled with the impression that professionals and managers are less hands-on in their work often evokes an image of unearned privilege in the minds of working class persons. Conversely, the fact that working class persons generally work with their hands may lead those of the middle-class to assume that those of the working class are incapable of abstract, intellectual reasoning. One must also consider that most professionals tend to work in their fields of interest; thus work may not be as perceived as dreadful and menial by them. For working class persons, however, the contrary may be true. This difference in job satisfaction tends to be perceived by working class persons as further proof of unearned privileged among their professional managers, further adding to class tension. Additionally middle-class persons may lack direct experience in relating to working-class persons outside of a formal workplace environment. Examples of interactions between both classes other than the common worker/manager interaction include that of consultations with physicians or therapists. Author Barbara Ehrenreich suggests that these relationships will often lead to the unconscious assumption of class privilege on the part of middle-class individuals in their dealings with members of the working class. Overall working class Americans are most likely to encounter a professional middle class persons in a situation where the latter either directs or advises the former. Meaning that working class persons usually do not converse with professionals unless they are receiving instructions or being given advice. Likewise, members of the contemporary middle class are increasingly unlikely to interact with working-class persons outside of a supervisor/employee setting, and will rarely attempt to know or relate to working-class individuals as individuals.

Waits original Waits wrote the song for his future wife Kathleen Brennan, who had been living in New Jersey. Waits said in a 1980 interview that, \\"I never thought I would catch myself saying 'sha la la' in a song ... This is my first experiment with 'sha la la.'\\" Waits' recording includes drums, bass, guitar, keyboards, and glockenspiel, in an arrangement that captures the feeling of the seashore by way of \\"Under the Boardwalk\\" or \\"Spanish Harlem\\". The song is included on Waits' compilation albums Bounced Checks (1981), Anthology of Tom Waits (1985), and Used Songs, 1973-1980 (2001). Waits also included a quiet performance of it during his 1999 appearance on VH1 Storytellers. Springsteen version The song, performed by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, was released as the B-side of the 1984 single \\"Cover Me\\". Springsteen slightly rewrote it to replace a Waits line about \\"whores on Eighth Avenue\\" with \\"the girls out on the avenue\\", and added a verse about taking \\"that little brat of yours and drop[ping] her off at your mom's\\" p. 55. (This line was originally written for \\"Party Lights\\", an out-take from The River, which wasn't officially released until 2015). The July 9, 1981 performance from this stand was used on the \\"Cover Me\\" release. A few weeks later on August 24, Waits joined Springsteen on-stage at the Los Angeles Sports Arena to perform the song together. The July 9 performance of \\"Jersey Girl\\" was used as the closing track of Springsteen's 1986 box set Live/1975-85, as Springsteen and producer Jon Landau felt it accurately represented the final phase of the loose story arc that connected the songs on the album together.Marsh, Glory Days, pp. 438‚Äì439. \\"Jersey Girl\\" would become a Springsteen favorite, played often in New Jersey and sometimes Philadelphia shows during the 1980s and early 1990s. Its appearances then became even rarer, being picked to open the last of 15 Meadowlands shows in 1999 on the Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band Reunion Tour ‚Äì as what The New York Times termed \\"a reward for [the fans'] faith and perseverance,\\" close the last of 10 shows at New Jersey's Giants Stadium in 2003 on The Rising Tour, and be the next-to-last song in the three-show run at Giants Stadium in 2008 on the Magic Tour. The song was played as the first fan requested song at his October 3, 2009 show and was the final song performed during the last October 9, 2009 show before the demolition of Giants Stadium. Because the Springsteen version of the song was more played on radio and because Springsteen was often associated with New Jersey, it was not unusual for people to mistakenly think Springsteen had written it. The song is sometimes erroneously associated with the \\"Jersey Girl\\" cultural stereotype, but in fact it makes no mention of most of the traits -- such as big hair -- usually associated with that stereotype. One writer for The New York Times stated that \\"the Jersey girl, the one Tom Waits and Bruce Springsteen sing about, knows she'll get what she wants,\\" and listed Springsteen's wife Patti Scialfa and Governor of New Jersey Christine Todd Whitman as examples that befit the song. * Corinne Bailey Rae covered the song on the 2019 compilation 'Women Sing Waits' of various women singing Waits songs. *Renee Cologne covered the song on her 2019 release Coverlings. *Bagatelle covered the song on their 1998 album, Gold.

Biography Kasahara was born into a military family in Sendai, but attended the First Tokyo Middle School as a youth. He graduated from the 22nd class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1913, and from the 22nd class of the Army Staff College in November 1918. Kasahara was sent as a military attach√© to Moscow, Russia from 1929‚Äì1932, and became fluent in the Russian language. On March 4, 1931, a telegram sent by Kasahara to the general staff in Tokyo was intercepted and decoded by Soviet military intelligence and forwarded to Stalin. In that, Yukio belittled Red Army's capabilities and urged \\"a speedy war\\" before the good timing passes. On December, 13, 1931, the OGPU decoded and forwarded to Stalin a conversation between Kasahara and his superior visiting Moscow, which advocating for war before the USSR became too strong and underscoring that ‚Äúthe countries on the Soviet western border (i.e., at a minimum Poland and Romania) are in a position to act with us. The thinking of Japanese ambassador to USSR, Hiroki Kota,‚Äúthe cardinal objective of this war must lay not so much in protecting Japan from Communism as in seizing the Soviet Far East and Eastern Siberia‚Äù was also mentioned that. On his return to Japan, he was assigned to the Soviet Branch of the 4th Section (European & American Military Intelligence), 2nd Bureau, of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff.Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II From 1933-1934, he became an instructor at the Cavalry School, and was subsequently appointed commander of the Imperial Guards Cavalry Regiment from 1934-1936. Kasahara returned to the 2nd Bureau of the General Staff in 1936 as Chief of the 4th Section, 5th Section and 6th Section, covering all of the European, American and Russian Intelligence. He was a major proponent of the Strike North Group (hokushin-ron) philosophy, feeling strongly that the Soviet Union posed a major threat and a major opportunity for Japan. From 1937-1938, Kasahara was sent to Manchukuo as Vice Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. He visited Germany as part of a military mission in 1938 after the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, and returned to the General Staff on his return to Japan. However, Kasahara was soon dispatched back to China. From 1939-1941, he served as Chief of Staff of the Northern China Area Army. He was then promoted to commander in chief of the IJA 12th Division from 1941-1942. For most the remainder of the war (1942‚Äì1945), Kasahara served as Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. However, in April 1945, he was appointed to replace General Yoshio Kozuki as commander of the IJA 11th Army, and thus participated in the Operation Ichi-Go offensive, notably at the Battle of Guilin-Liuzhou.Budge, The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia References Books  External links  Notes 1888 births 1988 deaths Military personnel from Miyagi Prefecture Japanese generals Japanese military personnel of World War II ","title":"Yukio Kasahara"},{"id":"6401680","text":"Arquimedes (also Arqu√≠medes) is a given name.

She was the wife of fiddler Peter Makem, mother of musicians Tommy Makem and Jack Makem, and grandmother of musicians Tom Sweeney, Jimmy Sweeney (of Northern Irish Canadian group Barley Bree), Shane Makem, Conor Makem and Rory Makem. Sarah Makem and her cousin, Annie Jane Kelly, were members of the Singing Greenes of Keady. In the 1950s, song collectors from the United States toured Ireland recording its musical heritage.

Her rendition of \\"As I Roved Out\\" opened the BBC Radio folk music programme of the same name in the 1950s.Hammond, D. (1977) Sarah Makem [youtube]. Ireland: TG4. Available at: https://youtu.be/u-2S4pAoaOs (Accessed 18 April 2017).  Background  Sarah Makem lived in Keady her whole life. Living in the border region of Ulster and in a market town, she was influenced by Irish, Scottish, and English traditions. Makem learned songs from her mother while she was doing household chores such as cooking. Makem would often pick up these songs while sitting with her mother after just one repetition. Makem also learned some of her repertoire from songs the children would sing in school. Sarah left school early to work as a factory weaver as many of the girls did in her town. She would work from 7 am - 6:30 pm then come home to have sessions with many of the other musicians living in the same area. Makem married Peter Makem in 1919.  Musical career  Sarah Makem wouldn't consider herself a musician; however, she has a vast musical career. She was a ballad singer who had over five hundred songs in memory. These songs she describes as life stories of murder and love and emigration songs. Makem recorded many of her songs, mostly for collection purposes. One of those songs, \\"As I Roved Out\\" was used to open a BBC radio program featuring Irish folk music named after Makem's ballad. Makem didn't intend to use this recording as such, and was very embarrassed to know her voiced would be heard everyday across Ireland.

He was infamous for his association with the Whiskey Rebellion, and his fictionalized escape to the Spanish-owned territory of West Florida (modern-day Louisiana) with soldiers at his tail. He was later pardoned by President John Adams for his actions. Today, his family's home in Washington, Pennsylvania is a national landmark and museum. Political life Throughout the early 18th century, what is now Washington County was claimed by both Virginia and Pennsylvania. It wasn't until March 28, 1781, the drawing of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line officially gave this land to Pennsylvania. Washington County was erected out of Westmoreland County at that time, and Washington, the county seat, was laid out by David Hoge later that same year. The following year, 1782, David Bradford, who was born in Maryland about 1760, came to town. Court records indicate that in April 1782 he was the sixth attorney to be admitted to the Washington County Bar Association. A brilliant young lawyer, he quickly established a very successful practice, and by 1783 he had been appointed deputy attorney-general for Washington County. David Bradford had important family connections in town. One of his sisters, Agnes, had married John McDowell, a prominent local attorney; another sister, Jane, had married Col. James Allison, a lawyer who had settled in the Chartiers Valley in 1774. Both McDowell and Allison were elders in the Rev. John McMillan's Chartiers Church, and they also were among the first trustees of both Canonsburg and Washington Academies. David Bradford joined his brothers-in-law as a trustee of Washington College (now Washington & Jefferson College) and was appointed a member of the building committee. He was instrumental in building McMillan Hall at Washington College, which is one of the oldest surviving educational buildings in the nation and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Bradford also became active in political affairs, and by 1791 he was becoming more and more absorbed in the escalating protest over a whiskey tax which had been levied by the federal government that year, and the general treatment of Western Pennsylvanians by the East. The Whiskey Rebellion By 1794, Bradford had become a prominent figure in the Whiskey Rebellion, an insurrection that was caused, in part, by the lack of federal courts (which necessitated trips to Philadelphia for trial), large numbers of absentee landlords, conflicts with American Indians, and, most importantly, the high excise tax on whiskey. President George Washington ordered 13,000 troops to the Washington, Pennsylvania area as the first test of the power of the new government. When the militias arrived in Parkison's Ferry (now Monongahela, Pennsylvania), they began arresting suspected rebels. Among those who had warrants out for their arrest was Bradford. Bradford's legendary escape According to Harriet Branton's book, David Bradford and His House, Bradford was at home on October 25, 1794, when he was warned of the approach of a cavalry unit with orders to capture him. Bradford leaped from a rear window of his house onto his waiting horse, galloping off into the night. With the soldiers in hot pursuit of him (there was a price of $500 on his head), Bradford made it to McKees Rocks, where he traded his \\"faithful grey horse\\" for a skiff and set out down the Ohio River. A touch-and-go gun battle with his pursuers went on all night but he managed to slip through by staying close to the opposite shore of the river. Once Bradford reached Louisiana, he sent for the rest of his family. The real escape Contrary to popular legend, Bradford did not leap from a rear window to escape arrest. Rather, he left Washington at a leisurely pace and went to Pittsburgh. From there he took a coal barge down the Ohio River to what is now Portsmouth, Ohio and (possibly later) to Spanish West Florida (New Orleans). According to the former historical collections director at Washington and Jefferson College, Charles M. Ewing, Federal authorities were most likely not too anxious to catch Bradford, as they did not want a difficult situation on their hands. Bradford apparently didn't even want to leave but was persuaded to do so by some of the other leaders of the insurrection, who for their own reasons, wanted him out of the way. David Bradford was discovered by some of the troops while he was on a coal barge not far from Pittsburgh, en route to Spanish lands. The ship's captain, a Captain Keene, and crew, apparently saw to it that Bradford was not bothered by the troops. Keene later was involved in the Aaron Burr conspiracy and lived for a while near Bradford in Louisiana. In 1797, David completed a home, the now famed \\"Most Haunted House in America\\", The Myrtles Plantation in St. Francisville. His wife, Elizabeth, and children joined him shortly thereafter.

Home David Bradford House, from across South Main Street Bradford built the first stone house on South Main Street in Washington, Pennsylvania in 1788, which, by frontier standards, ranked as a mansion. The handsome stairway was solid mahogany; the mantel-pieces and other interior furnishings, imported from Philadelphia, were transported across the Alleghenies at considerable expense. The David Bradford House was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1983. The Myrtles Plantation was built in 1794 by General David Bradford and was called Laurel Grove at the time. General Bradford lived there alone for several years, until being pardoned for his role in the Whiskey Rebellion in 1799. He then moved his wife Elizabeth and their five children to the plantation from Pennsylvania.

The son of an Army officer, Stock lived in many states across America before settling in St. Petersburg, Florida. He received his Bachelor of Arts Degree from the University of South Florida in Tampa where he studied under Theo Wujcik. Upon graduating in 1976, Stock was hired to work at Gemini G.E.L. in Los Angeles as a lithographer. While there, he printed for notable artists such as Jasper Johns, David Hockney, Robert Rauschenberg, and Roy Lichtenstein before leaving to paint full-time. Mark‚Äôs final resting place is at the Mountain View Cemetery in Altadena, California. His tombstone depicts an image that he drew in 1977 of a tombstone in a wagon. The backstory of this image is explained by Mark in this video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eSYOAPmiBus Ballet and Modern Dance In 1977, Stock began studying ballet and modern dance. His work expanded to include designing sets for various Los Angeles- based dance companies. He started to paint the figure in 1983 and has become widely known for his narrative paintings. Paintings From the 2000 book, Mark Stock: Paintings, by Barnaby Conrad III: \\"Mark Stock's paintings connect viewers to the euphoria, loneliness and sometimes fatal entanglements of romance. Often melodramatic and tinged with irony, Stock's images illustrate love's power to provoke our best - and most illicit - behavior. A well-dressed voyeur peeks through a mansion window, silent and intent on the object of his desire. Picknicking lovers lock into each other's eyes. An attractive woman smokes a cigarette as she sits next to a man's corpse, which has been rolled neatly in a carpet, ready for disposal. A butler steals a moment to treasure lipstick left on a glass by the woman who employs him. Stock's paintings tell each character's story with remarkable clarity and, in many cases, with humor. A master of the realist narrative style, Stock uses color, shadow and line to amazing effect. Details in facial inflection, body language, and background tell you there's more going on here than rapture, scandal, and dangerous liaisons. These paintings keep you coming back for another look, for clues to life's emotionally charged moments.\\" Stock's works can be found in the permanent collections of Brooklyn Museum, Museum of Modern Art (New York and San Francisco), The Library of Congress and The National Gallery of Art. Musician Besides painting, Mark Stock was a jazz drummer whose trio performed regularly. He was also an accomplished magician and a champion golfer. He resided in Oakland, California.

Built by the Reading Railroad, it later served SEPTA Regional Rail's Fox Chase/Newtown Line. SEPTA closed the station in 1983. History Reading Railroad built the station in 1873 as the terminus of its line. In the railroad's original plans, the line was to continue to the north, but this expansion was never built. The building was torn down in 1960, and a new shelter was constructed in 1976. It later became a part of SEPTA's Fox Chase Rapid Transit Line. The station, and all of those north of Fox Chase station, was closed on January 18, 1983 due to failing diesel train equipment. SEPTA experimented with the line by operating the Fox Chase-Newtown diesel segment as the Fox Chase Rapid Transit Line. SEPTA insisted on utilizing transit operators from the Broad Street Subway as a cost-saving factor, while Conrail requested that railroad motormen run the service. This was a result of a labor dispute that began when SEPTA inherited approximately 1,700 displaced employees from Conrail. When a federal court ruled that SEPTA had to use Conrail employees in order to offer job assurance, SEPTA cancelled Fox Chase- Newtown trains. SEPTA must use Conrail workers rather than its own personnel to run trains over the region's 13 commuter lines, a special federal court has ruled in a decision that offers some job assurance for 1,700 Conrail employees next year. The special court, in an opinion issued Wednesday, ruled that SEPTA had acted legally in October when it replaced Conrail workers with its former subway operators on the line. Service in the diesel-only territory north of Fox Chase was cancelled at that time, and the Newtown station still appears in publicly posted tariffs.SEPTA Tariff No. 154; effective July 1, 2013 Although rail service was initially replaced with a Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus, patronage remained light, and the Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus service ended in 1999.

A cymbal- banging monkey toy (better known as Jolly Chimp) is a mechanical depiction of a monkey holding a cymbal in each hand. When activated it repeatedly bangs its cymbals together and, in some cases, bobs its head, chatters, screeches, grins, pops eyes out, does flips, and more. There are both traditional wind-up versions as well as updated battery-operated cymbal-banging monkeys. History The Japanese company Daishin C.K. manufactured the classic cymbal monkey during the 1950s to 1970s under the name \\"Musical Jolly Chimp\\". It screeched and showed its teeth when its head was pressed. It had a black on/off lever on its back and came with a green arm tag. Later versions from other toy makers copied the facial expressions but often changed the toy's outfit and name. In the mid-1960s through the early 1970s, the Japanese- manufactured \\"Charley Chimp\\" was sold by street peddlers on the streets of lower Manhattan in NYC. Other brand names include \\"Wind-up Monkey Playing Cymbals\\" from Russ, \\"Pepi Tumbling Monkey with Cymbal\\" from Yano Man Toys, \\"Clockwork Musical Monkey with Clashing Cymbals\\", \\"Musical Monkey\\", \\"Magic Monkey\\",\\"Mister Monkey\\" and \\"Jolly Chimp\\". There is also one called \\"Charlie Chimp\\" from Lincoln, which is different from \\"Charley Chimp\\". With many other companies manufacturing various versions in the United States, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines, the toy's appearance varies. The change in manufacturing countries was primarily due to factories going out of business and seeking the lowest manufacturing costs. This is still the case today. The monkey has been seen wearing red-and-white-striped pants and a yellow vest with red buttons, or red overalls and a stocking cap. Other outfits include green-striped pants, blue-striped pants, a red shirt with either green or blue pants, and plaid blue overalls. The monkeys are sometimes rendered with red rings painted around their wide-open eyes, creating an appearance some find disturbing, perhaps explaining their many appearances in horror, sci-fi, and comedy media. They can also symbolize emptiness and mindlessness.

Synopsis A scorpion, which cannot swim, asks a frog to carry it across a river on the frog's back. The frog hesitates, afraid of being stung by the scorpion, but the scorpion argues that if it did that, they would both drown. The frog considers this argument sensible and agrees to transport the scorpion. Midway across the river, the scorpion stings the frog anyway, dooming them both.

This earlier fable appears in the Anvaar Soheili, a Persian collection of fables written c. 1500 by Hossein Va'ez Kashefi.Ruymbeke (2016). Kashefi's Anvar-e Sohayli, p. 292. The Anvaar Soheili is in part a translation of fables from the Panchatantra, a collection of Indian fables written in Sanskrit, but The Scorpion and the Turtle does not appear in the Panchatantra, which means it was added to the Anvaar Soheili by Kashefi and is thus likely Persian in origin. In the Scorpion and the Turtle, it is a turtle that carries the scorpion across the river, and the turtle survives the scorpion's sting thanks to its protective shell. The turtle is baffled by the scorpion's behavior because they are old friends and the scorpion must have known that its stinger would not pierce the turtle's shell. The scorpion responds that it acted neither out of malice nor ingratitude, but merely an irresistible and indiscriminate urge to sting. The turtle then delivers the following reflection: :\\"Truly have the sages said that to cherish a base character is to give one's honor to the wind, and to involve one's own self in embarrassment.\\" The moral of this fable is thus stated explicitly, and not left to interpretation. An important difference with The Scorpion and the Frog is that, in this fable with the turtle, the scorpion does not expect to drown. In some later versions of the fable, the turtle punishes the scorpion by drowning it anyway.Dutton (1908). The Tortoise and the Geese, pp. 12-13. Aesop The Scorpion and the Frog has often been attributed to Aesop, but it does not appear in any collection of his fables prior to the 20th century. However, there are earlier fables attributed to Aesop which teach similar morals regarding trust. These include The Farmer and the Viper, which warns that kindness will not stop a scoundrel from hurting its benefactor, and The Frog and the Mouse, which warns that treacherous friends often hurt themselves in the process.James (1852). Aesop's Fables. A New Version, Chiefly From Original Sources, p. 14. Interpretations The fable does not explicitly state the moral it tries to teach, and thus it is left to interpretation. A common interpretation is that people with vicious personalities cannot resist hurting others, even when it is not in their interests.: The Italian writer Giancarlo Livraghi has commented that while there are plenty of animal fables which warn against trusting vicious people, in none of these other fables is the villain suicidal. The Scorpion and the Frog is unique in that the scorpion is irrationally self-destructive and fully aware of it. For Freudian psychoanalysis, \\"it seems like a textbook illustration of the death drive ‚Äî are we not all, on some level, self-sabotaging scorpions?\\"Schuster (2016). The Trouble with Pleasure, p. 70. The French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, by contrast, saw the scorpion not as a character structure but as a fictional character made a victim of circumstance: \\"his desire becomes fatal destiny owing to an unfortunate combination of contingent factors.\\" To a social psychologist, the fable may present a dispositionist view of human nature because it seems to reject the idea that people behave rationally according to circumstances.Lasine (2012). Weighing Hearts, p. 110. The French sociologist Jean-Claude Passeron saw the scorpion as a metaphor for Machiavellian politicians who delude themselves by their unconscious tendency to rationalize their ill-conceived plans, and thereby lead themselves and their followers to ruin. Orson Welles felt that the scorpion's lack of hypocrisy gave it a certain charm: \\"I will always like a man who admits to being a bastard, a murderer, or whatever you want, and tells me: 'I killed three people'. He is immediately my brother, because he is frank. I think that frankness does not excuse the crime, but it makes him very attractive, it gives him charm.\\"Bazin et al. (1958). \\"Interview with Orson Welles\\", pp. 24-25: Other contexts Since the fable's narration in Mr. Arkadin, it has been recounted as a key element in other films, including Skin Deep (1989),Wasson (2011). A Splurch in the Kisser, p. 296. The Crying Game (1992), Drive (2011), and The Devil's Carnival (2012). In addition, references to the fable have appeared in comics,As Grimm Fairy Tales #39 (June 2009).

In particular, James is concerned in this lecture about defending the rationality of religious faith even lacking sufficient evidence of religious truth. James states in his introduction: \\"I have brought with me tonight ... an essay in justification of faith, a defense of our right to adopt a believing attitude in religious matters, in spite of the fact that our merely logical intellect may not have been coerced. 'The Will to Believe,' accordingly, is the title of my paper.\\" James' central argument in \\"The Will to Believe\\" hinges on the idea that access to the evidence for whether or not certain beliefs are true depends crucially upon first adopting those beliefs without evidence. As an example, James argues that it can be rational to have unsupported faith in one's own ability to accomplish tasks that require confidence. Importantly, James points out that this is the case even for pursuing scientific inquiry. James then argues that like belief in one's own ability to accomplish a difficult task, religious faith can also be rational even if one at the time lacks evidence for the truth of one's religious belief. The lecture James' \\"The Will to Believe\\" and William K. Clifford's essay \\"The Ethics of Belief\\" are touchstones for many contemporary debates over evidentialism, faith, and overbelief. James' \\"The Will to Believe\\" consists of introductory remarks followed by ten numbered but not titled sections. In his introductory remarks, James characterizes his lecture by stating that he had \\"brought with me tonight ... an essay in justification of faith, a defense of our right to adopt a believing attitude in religious matters, despite our merely logical intellect may not have been coerced.\\" \\"The Will to Believe\\", accordingly, is the title of my paper.\\" At the end of his introductory remarks, James leads into his first section by stating that he \\"must begin by setting up some technical distinctions\\". Sections I‚ÄìIII: Preliminaries In section I, James embarks upon the task of defining a number of important terms he will be relying upon throughout the lecture: * Live and dead hypotheses ‚Äì \\"deadness and liveness ... are measured by [a thinker's] willingness to act. The maximum of liveness in a hypothesis means willingness to act irrevocably\\" * Option ‚Äì \\"the decision between two hypotheses\\" * Living and dead option ‚Äì \\"a living option is one in which both hypotheses are live ones\\" * Forced and avoidable option ‚Äì an option for which there is \\"no possibility of not choosing\\" * Momentous and trivial option ‚Äì an \\"option is trivial when the opportunity is not unique, when the stake is insignificant, or when the decision is reversible if it later proves unwise\\" * Genuine option ‚Äì \\"we may call an option a genuine option when it is of the forced, living, and momentous kind\\" * Belief ‚Äì \\"A chemist finds a hypothesis live enough to spend a year in its verification: he believes in it to that extent.\\" In section II, James begins by saying he will then consider \\"the actual psychology of human opinion\\". Here James considers and largely agrees with the criticism of Pascal's Wager that we either should not or are unable to believe or disbelieve at will. That is, James here seems to reject doxastic voluntarism, \\"the philosophical doctrine according to which people have voluntary control over their beliefs\\".Rico Vitz, \\"Doxastic Voluntarism\\", Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy In section III, however, James qualifies his endorsement of this criticism of Pascal's Wager by arguing that \\"it is only our already dead hypotheses that our willing nature is unable to bring to life again\\". By which James means that it is only things we already disbelieve that we are unable to believe at will. Section IV: Thesis In his very brief section IV, James introduces the main thesis of the work: However, instead of providing an argument for this thesis, James quickly ends this section by stating that he must still \\"indulge in a bit more of preliminary work\\". Sections V‚ÄìVII: More preliminaries In section V, James makes a distinction between a skepticism about truth and its attainment and what he calls \\"dogmatism\\": \\"that truth exists, and that our minds can find it\\". Concerning dogmatism, James states that it has two forms; that there is an \\"absolutist way\\" and an \\"empiricist way\\" of believing in truth. James states: \\"The absolutists in this matter say that we not only can attain to knowing truth, but we can know when we have attained to knowing it, while the empiricists think that although we may attain it, we cannot infallibly know when.\\" James then goes on to state that \\"the empiricist tendency has largely prevailed in science, while in philosophy the absolutist tendency has had everything its own way\\". James ends section V by arguing that empiricists are really no more tentative about their beliefs and conclusions than the absolutists: \\"The greatest empiricists among us are only empiricists on reflection: when left to their instincts, they dogmatize like infallible popes. When the Cliffords tell us how sinful it is to be Christians on such \\"insufficient evidence\\", insufficiency is really the last thing they have in mind. For them the evidence is absolutely sufficient, only it makes the other way. They believe so completely in an anti-Christian order of the universe that there is no living option: Christianity is a dead hypothesis from the start.\\" James begins section VI with the following question: \\"But now, since we are all such absolutists by instinct, what in our quality of students of philosophy ought we to do about the fact? Shall we espouse and endorse it?\\" He then answers: \\"I sincerely believe that the latter course is the only one we can follow as reflective men. ... I am, therefore, myself a complete empiricist so far as my theory of human knowledge goes.\\" James ends section VI by stressing what he finds to be the \\"great difference\\" merit of the empiricist way over the absolutist way: \\"The strength of his system lies in the principles, the origin, the terminus a quo [the beginning point] of his thought; for us the strength is in the outcome, the upshot, the terminus ad quem [the end result]. Not where it comes from but what it leads to is to decide. It matters not to an empiricist from what quarter a hypothesis may come to him: he may have acquired it by fair means or by foul; passion may have whispered or accident suggested it; but if the total drift of thinking continues to confirm it, that is what he means by its being true.\\" James begins section VII by stating that there is \\"one more point, small but important, and our preliminaries are done\\". However, James in fact gives in this section a crucial bit of argumentation: Sections VIII‚ÄìX: Main argument In section VIII, James finally moves beyond what he considers mere preliminaries. Here James first identifies areas of belief where he holds that to believe without evidence would be unjustified: \\"Wherever the option between losing truth and gaining it is not momentous, we can throw the chance of gaining truth away, and at any rate save ourselves from any chance of believing falsehood, by not making up our minds at all till objective evidence has come. In scientific questions, this is almost always the case ... The questions here are always trivial options, the hypotheses are hardly living (at any rate not living for us spectators), the choice between believing truth or falsehood is seldom forced.\\" James concludes this section by asking us to agree \\"that wherever there is no forced option, the dispassionately judicial intellect with no pet hypothesis, saving us, as it does from dupery at any rate, ought to be our ideal\\". In section IX, James moves to investigate whether there are areas of belief where belief without evidence would be justified. James gives self-fulfilling beliefs as one example of such beliefs: From examples like these, James concludes: \\"There are, then, cases where a fact cannot come at all unless a preliminary faith exists in its coming. And where faith in a fact can help create the fact, that would be an insane logic which should say that faith running ahead of scientific evidence is the \\"lowest kind of immorality\\" into which a thinking being can fall.\\" James begins section X with the thesis that he takes himself to have already proven: \\"In truths dependent on our personal action, then, faith based on desire is certainly a lawful and possibly an indispensable thing.\\" James then goes on to argue that, like the examples he gave in section IX, religious belief is also the sort of belief that depends on our personal action and therefore can also justifiably be believed through a faith based on desire: Although James does not here explain the way in which the truth or evidence regarding religious belief depends upon our first having religious belief, he does argue that it is a part of the religious belief itself that its own truth or the evidence of its own truth depends upon our first believing it. In the preface to the published version of \\"The Will to Believe\\" James offers a different argument for the way in which the evidence for religion depends upon our belief. There he contends that it is through the failure or thriving of communities of religious believers that we come to have evidence of the truth of their religious beliefs. In this way, to acquire evidence for religious belief, we must first have believers who adopt such belief without sufficient evidence. Much later in life, in his \\"Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking\\" lectures, James also mentions the possibility that God's existence may actually depend upon our belief in his existence. The doctrine The doctrine James argues for in \\"The Will to Believe\\" appears often in both his earlier and later work. James himself changed the name of the doctrine several times. First appearing as \\"the duty to believe\\", then \\"the subjective method\\", then \\"the will to believe\\", it was finally recast by James as \\"the right to believe\\". Whatever the name, the doctrine always concerned the rationality of believing without evidence in certain instances. Specifically, James is defending the violation of evidentialism in two instances: * Hypothesis venturing (see hypothetico-deductivism) ‚Äì beliefs whose evidence becomes available only after they are believed * Self-fulfilling beliefs ‚Äì beliefs that by existing make themselves true. After arguing that for hypothesis venturing and with self-fulfilling beliefs a person is rational to believe without evidence, James argues that a belief in a number of philosophical topics qualifies as one or other of his two allowed violations of evidentialism (e.g. free will, God, and immortality). The reason James takes himself as able to rationally justify positions often not believed to be verifiable under any method, is how important he thinks believing something can be for the verifying of that belief. That is to say, in these cases James is arguing that the reason evidence for a belief seems to be unavailable to us is because the evidence for its truth or falsity comes only after it is believed rather than before. For example, in the following passage James utilizes his doctrine to justify a belief that \\"this is a moral world\\": > It cannot then be said that the question, \\"Is this a moral world?\\" is a > meaningless and unverifiable question because it deals with something non- > phenomenal. Any question is full of meaning to which, as here, contrary > answers lead to contrary behavior. And it seems as if in answering such a > question as this we might proceed exactly as does the physical philosopher > in testing an hypothesis. ... So here: the verification of the theory which > you may hold as to the objectively moral character of the world can consist > only in this‚Äîthat if you proceed to act upon your theory it will be reversed > by nothing that later turns up as your action's fruits; it will harmonize so > well with the entire drift of experience that the latter will, as it were, > adopt it. ... If this be an objectively moral universe, all acts that I make > on that assumption, all expectations that I ground on it, will tend more and > more completely to interdigitate with the phenomena already existing. ... > While if it be not such a moral universe, and I mistakenly assume that it > is, the course of experience will throw ever new impediments in the way of > my belief, and become more and more difficult to express in its language. > Epicycle upon epicycle of subsidiary hypothesis will have to be invoked to > give to the discrepant terms a temporary appearance of squaring with each > other; but at last even this resource will fail. (‚ÄîWilliam James, \\"The > Sentiment of Rationality\\") The doctrine James developed in his \\"The Will to Believe\\" lecture was later extended by his prot√©g√© F. C. S. Schiller in his lengthy essay \\"Axioms as Postulates\\". In this work, Schiller downplays the connection between James' doctrine and religious positions like God and immortality. Instead, Schiller stresses the doctrine's ability to justify our beliefs in the uniformity of nature, causality, space, time, and other philosophic doctrines that have generally been considered to be empirically unverifiable. Criticism James' doctrine has taken a lot of criticism. In 1907 University of Michigan Professor Alfred Henry Lloyd published \\"The Will to Doubt\\" in response, claiming that doubt was essential to true belief. Charles Sanders Peirce ends his 1908 paper \\"A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God\\" complaining generally about what other philosophers had done with pragmatism, and ends with a criticism specifically of James' will to believe: > It seems to me a pity they [pragmatists like James, Schiller] should allow a > philosophy so instinct with life to become infected with seeds of death in > such notions as that of the unreality of all ideas of infinity and that of > the mutability of truth, and in such confusions of thought as that of active > willing (willing to control thought, to doubt, and to weigh reasons) with > willing not to exert the will (willing to believe). Bertrand Russell in \\"Free Thought and Official Propaganda\\" argued that one must always adhere to fallibilism, recognizing of all human knowledge that \\"None of our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error\\", and that the only means of progressing ever-closer to the truth is to never assume certainty, but always examine all sides and try to reach a conclusion objectively. Walter Kaufmann wrote: > Instead of admitting that some traditional beliefs are comforting, James > argued that \\"the risk of being in error is a very small matter when compared > with the blessing of real knowledge\\", and implied that those who did not > accept religious beliefs were cowards, afraid of risking anything: \\"It is > like a general informing soldiers that it is better to keep out of battle > forever than to risk a single wound\\" (Section VII). James' appeal depends > entirely on blurring the distinction between those who hold out for 100 > percent proof in a matter in which any reasonable person rests content with, > let us say, 90 percent, and those who refuse to indulge in a belief which is > supported only by the argument that after all it could conceivably be > true.Walter Kaufmann, Critique of Religion and Philosophy, 1958, p83 Some specific objections to James' doctrine include: # the necessity of positing a hypothesis without personally adopting it as a belief # the epistemological problems of belief voluntarism # success in the world verifies a belief, rather than restricting verification to predictive success # the separation of belief adoption from truth and epistemic justification James addresses objection (1) in a footnote of his \\"The Will to Believe\\" essay where he argues that for a chemist to devote years of his life to verifying a hypothesis, the chemist must also believe his hypothesis. However, the chemist adopting a hypothesis to guide years of study is certainly only a special case of hypothesis adoption. A more general defense of (1) could also be constructed from James' behaviorist theory of belief. James takes believing a proposition to consist in acting as if it were true, so if James considers testing a proposition as acting as if it were true to see if it leads to successful action, then James would be committed to seeing an act of hypothesis adoption as necessarily an act of belief adoption as well. Objection (2) seems to presuppose the ability to will a belief. James believed that when evidence was insufficient to determine the truth or falsehood of a proposition, this uncertainty allowed a person to be able to will a belief by acting as if that belief were true. Objection (2) warrants further discussion over \\"voluntarism\\". Objection (3) strikes at James' pragmatic theory of truth, which his will to believe doctrine seems to presume. James' main defense of his theory of truth is his claim that no other account of \\"truth\\" or \\"correspondence\\" or \\"agreement with reality\\" can be given except for the pragmatist account. James sees traditional accounts of truth as explaining one mysterious term (\\"truth\\") with nothing more than equally mysterious terms (e.g. \\"correspondence\\"). The only sense James believes we can make of the concept of \\"truth\\" is if we count as true the beliefs that lead us to perform actions that \\"agree\\" with the world. Those that fit with the world will lead to successful action, those that do not agree with the world will entail actions that lead to failure (e.g. if one believes he can fly, he'll jump off a building). With truth analyzed in this way, James sees no reason to restrict success to predictive success (objection (3)) and is fully comfortable with the fact that certain beliefs will lead one person to success in the world while failing someone else (objection (4)). However, this reply to both objections is not open to James since he explicitly claims that his will to believe doctrine does not depend on his pragmatist theory of truth.

Biography Robert Mandel was born in Oakland, California, but grew up in Queens, New York, where he became interested in theater. Mandel attended Bucknell University and decided to pursue stage directing at Manhattan Theatre Club and The Public Theater during the early 1970s. During the late 1970s, Mandel attended M.F.A. studies at Columbia University and then at the AFI Conservatory, where he graduated in 1979. During his studies at the American Film Institute, Mandel received the Alfred Hitchcock Award for his thesis film, Night at O'Rears, which then went on to win the First Prize at Filmex in Los Angeles, First Prize at the USA Film Festival in Dallas, Texas; and was exhibited at the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center. Mandel went on to become a successful film director, as well as a television series director, having directed Lost, Nash Bridges and The Practice. He was the director of the pilot for The X-Files and the sixth episode of Prison Break.

(AMD) is a manufacturer of three aircraft- the Alarus CH2000, the Zodiac CH601, and the Patriot 150. The CH2000 is a two-seat, single engine aircraft used primarily for flight training purposes. The CH601 is a two-seat light sport aircraft in the USA and an AULA in Canada and is used mainly as a personal aircraft. The Patriot 150 is a two- seat, high-winged SLSA with STOL performance. Unlike the other SLSA (Zodiac), the Patriot is not available as a kit; only as a ready-to-fly SLSA. The company is headquartered in Eastman, Georgia, USA. History Founded in 1974 by aeronautical engineer Chris Heintz, Zenair, Ltd. of Midland, Ontario, Canada began its presence in the light aircraft industry with a single aircraft design, the ZENITH CH 200. This two-seat kit aircraft was designed by Heintz during the sixties while he was chief engineer at French aircraft manufacturer Avions Pierre Robin. The ZENITH was an all-metal two-seat low- wing monoplane, designed to be simple and affordable: Simple because Heintz was an engineer and not a craftsman, and affordable because he was raising a family with five children while building the prototype. Since 1974, Heintz has designed and developed more than 12 new aircraft models which have been marketed and sold as kit aircraft around the world. Among them was the Zenair ZENITH CH2000. This aircraft, based on Heintz' kit aircraft CH640 design, received FAA type certification on July 25, 1995. This type-certified aircraft was renamed and is now manufactured as the AMD Alarus CH2000. Recently, the company changed hands. Where the original company was owned by a member of the Heintz family (and known as Aircraft Manufacturing and Development, Inc.), the new company was created by the existing executive team and incorporated in Georgia, USA as a Limited Liability Company named Aircraft Manufacturing and Design, LLC. The new company retained the \\"AMD\\" shorthand and very similar logos. The new company also took over the responsibility for all the previous AMD's Zodiacs; but not the Alarus. And, the new AMD will be producing the Patriot.Georgia Dept. of State; Aircraft Manufacturing and Design (unclear ref)Bayerl, Robby; Martin Berkemeier; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2011-12, page 170.

Developed by Neversoft and Treyarch, and published by Activision under the Activision O2 label, Pro Skater 2x is a re-release featuring the 19 levels from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Pro Skater 2, as well as five levels exclusive to the game. Some elements from the then-recently released Pro Skater 3 were included, along with other new features. It was released in North America for Xbox on November 15, 2001 as a launch title for the system. Gameplay Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is a skateboarding video game, with an arcade-style emphasis with regard to realism. The objective is to score points by successfully completing various skateboarding tricks such as grinds, flip tricks, and aerials. Performing several moves in succession without any pause results in a combo. The player's score is multiplied by the number of tricks in the combo. If the player successfully lands the final trick the score is then banked, otherwise all points in that combo are lost. Three \\"Career\\" modes are included in the game: both full career modes from Pro Skater and Pro Skater 2, and a shorter career mode exclusive to Pro Skater 2x. Players are tasked with completing objectives in each level within the given time limit. These include achieving a set high score, collecting the letters S-K-A-T-E, performing a certain trick on or over a certain object, and on certain levels, earning a top-three finish in a competition. Completion of these objectives is necessary to unlock new levels, skateboards, hidden characters, and stat points that can be spent to upgrade a character's attributes. Along with graphical improvements to the game's remade levels and character models, some minor cosmetic changes were made to the environments (such as the addition of an air traffic control tower in the level, \\"The Hanger\\"). Some features introduced in Pro Skater 3 were included: female characters could be created in Create-a-skater mode, and a visible balance meter was implemented for grinding. The re-vert is not included in 2x, but two of its exclusive levels allow for vert tricks to be landed in manuals to similarly extend combos. A \\"motion-blur\\" camera effect was included in the game, a feature which would later return to the series with Tony Hawk's Underground 2. Though the game featured no online play, up to eight players could compete via Xbox system link. Point bonuses, which were scattered around the original levels featured in Pro Skater, were removed for this game; unlike in the original game, however, players can utilize the manual on these levels resulting in larger scores. Reception The game received generally positive reviews upon release. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot called the game \\"the equivalent of a \\"director's cut\\" edition, containing the original product and some nominal enhancements.\\" He went on to say \\"While the game is technically the best version of Tony Hawk 2 to date, and while the addition of the Tony Hawk 1 levels is a nice touch, the game feels a little dated, whether you compare it to the rest of the Xbox lineup or the recently released Tony Hawk 3...\\"http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro- skater-2x-review/1900-2825024/ Vincent Lopez of IGN stated \\"Tony Hawk 2x is exactly what you expect‚Äîan amazing translation of Tony Hawk 1 and 2 with extra touches such as more detailed characters, and crisper textures and details on the environments. Unfortunately, because it's exactly what you expect, this isn't a game that can be recommended to everyone.http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/11/14/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2x Blake Fischer reviewed the Xbox version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"If you've got an Xbox and need some Hawk action, this is great value.

AVKP was set up in the end of 1993 by the scientist Sayad Sayadov and registered by the Justice Ministry in 1995. After a split in 1997, AVKP broke into two different parties both named United Communist Party of Azerbaijan, one led by Sayadov and the other led by the Baku City Party Committee Musa Tukanov. The bulk of United Communists sided with Tukanov, who replaced Sayadov as leader at a congress in 1998. Nonetheless, the Justice Ministry recognizes Sayadov as leader. Sayadov's faction (AVKP-1) is also officially registered while Tukanov's faction (AVKP-2) is unregistered. In May 2002, Tukanov proposed to set up the Coordination Council of Leftist Forces. Besides the AVKP-2, the Bolsheviks' Organization and the Labors' Union, also Azerbaijan Communist Party (on Platform of Marxism-Leninism) (a party that was formed in 2000, following a split from the AVKP itself) led by Telman Nurullayev intended to join to the CCLF. CCLF is created with the purpose of consolidation of the efforts of the leftist forces \\"at the struggle for socialism\\". Founders are trying to change \\"raptorial capitalist regime\\". In the words of Tukanov, AVKP-2 and its allies support changing the power through democratic methods in the country. Nevertheless, Tukanov does not also except the revolution way and in his opinion, \\"revolutionary situation must itself be grown\\". AVKP-2 supports Azerbaijan's unification to Belarus and Russia union. As to the idea of restoration of the USSR, in Tukanov's opinion, it should take place through a referendum. He thinks if \\"the representatives of workers\\" come to power in Azerbaijan, Armenia and Russia, Karabakh problem will also be settled. In the 2005 Azerbaijan parliamentary election, Sayad Sayadov managed to obtain 8.3% of the votes in the District 12 arriving second after the candidate of the ruling party NAP Mixail Zabelin.

Called \\"one of the defining classics of Chicago electric blues\\", \\"Killing Floor\\" became a blues standard with recordings by various artists. It has been acknowledged by the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame, which noted its popularity among rock as well as blues musicians. Original song Howlin' Wolf recorded \\"Killing Floor\\" in 1964, which Chess Records released as a single. According to blues guitarist and longtime Wolf associate Hubert Sumlin, the song uses the killing floorthe area of a slaughterhouse where animals are killedas a metaphor or allegory for male- female relationships: \\"Down on the killing floorthat means a woman has you down, she went out of her way to try to kill you. She at the peak of doing it, and you got away now ... You know people have wished they was deadyou been treated so bad that sometimes you just say, 'Oh Lord have mercy.' You‚Äôd rather be six feet in the ground.\\" \\"Killing Floor\\" is an upbeat twelve-bar blues with an \\"instantly familiar\\" guitar riff provided by Sumlin. Backing Howlin' Wolf (vocals) and Sumlin (electric guitar) are Lafayette Leake (piano), Buddy Guy (acoustic guitar), Andrew \\"Blueblood\\" McMahon (bass), Sam Lay (drums), Arnold Rogers (tenor sax), and Donald Hankins (baritone sax). The song appears on several Howlin' Wolf compilation albums, including his 1966 album The Real Folk Blues. Jimi Hendrix rendition Jimi Hendrix performed \\"Killing Floor\\" early in his career, including early vocal performances with Curtis Knight and the Squires in 1965 and 1966. Shortly after arriving in England in September 1966, Hendrix performed the song when he sat in with Cream. \\"Killing Floor\\" was included in the set list of the newly formed Jimi Hendrix Experience. The song was often a set opener, and Hendrix played the song at a faster tempo, with a different rhythm guitar and bass line. Early recordings include live versions from October 1966 in Paris (The Jimi Hendrix Experience box set), March 1967 in the BBC studios (BBC Sessions), and June 1967 at the Monterey International Pop Festival (Jimi Plays Monterey). Led Zeppelin version Led Zeppelin performed \\"Killing Floor\\" live in 1968 and 1969, and it became the basis for \\"The Lemon Song\\". In some early performances Robert Plant introduced the song as \\"Killing Floor\\"; an early UK pressing of Led Zeppelin II showed the title as \\"Killing Floor\\" and was credited to Chester Burnett (Howlin' Wolf's legal name). Led Zeppelin's version was performed at a much slower tempo (until the bridge) and with some different lyrics. After legal action by Howlin' Wolf's publisher, his name was added to the credits for \\"The Lemon Song\\". Recognition and legacy \\"Killing Floor\\" is recognized as a blues standard, with Skip James' 1931 recording \\"Hard Time Killing Floor Blues\\" as the likely inspiration. In 1991, the song was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in the \\"Classics of Blues Recordings\\" category. The panel identified it as \\"one of Wolf‚Äôs most recognizable songs.

Note the pointed shape of the arches. Aqueduct and commemorative arch in the Amoreiras neighbourhood. The aqueduct seen from the west The √Åguas Livres Aqueduct (, , \\"Aqueduct of the Free Waters\\") is a historic aqueduct in the city of Lisbon, Portugal. It is one of the most remarkable examples of 18th-century Portuguese engineering. The main course of the aqueduct covers 18 km, but the whole network of canals extends through nearly 58 km. The city of Lisbon has always suffered from lack of drinking water, and King John V decided to build an aqueduct to bring water from sources in the parish of Cane√ßas, in the modern municipality of Odivelas. The project was paid for by a special sales tax on beef, olive oil, wine, and other products. History Construction started in 1731 under the direction of Italian architect Antonio Canevari, replaced in 1732 by a group of Portuguese architects and engineers, including Manuel da Maia, Azevedo Fortes and Jos√© da Silva Pais. Between 1733 and 1736, the project was directed by Manuel da Maia, who in turn was replaced by Cust√≥dio Vieira, who would remain at the head of the project until around 1747. Cust√≥dio Vieira conceived the centerpiece of the aqueduct, the arches over the Alcantara valley, completed in 1744. A total of 35 arches cross the valley, covering 941 m. The tallest arches reach a height of 65 m, and many are pointed, reminiscent of arches in Gothic style. It is considered a masterpiece of engineering in the Baroque period. In 1748, although the project was still unfinished, the aqueduct finally started to bring water to the city of Lisbon, a fact celebrated in a commemorative arch built in the Amoreiras neighbourhood. From this period on, construction was overseen by other architects, including Carlos Mardel of Hungary and others. During the reigns of Jos√© I and Maria I, the network of canals and fountains was greatly enlarged. On November 1st, 1755, the 1755 Lisbon earthquake hit the city, but the brand new aqueduct managed to remain intact. It is possible to visit and cross the aqueduct, starting at the Museu da √Ågua (Water Museum). M√£e d'√Ågua The M√£e d'√Ågua (Mother of the Water) reservoir of the Amoreiras, the largest of the water reservoirs, was finished in 1834. This reservoir, with a capacity of 5,500 m¬≥ of water, was designed by Carlos Mardel. It is now deactivated and can be visited as part of the Museu da √Ågua (Water Museum).

He ran as a Republican candidate for governor in 1861, and was elected by a large majority, 33,152 votes compared to 5,722 for his nearest competitor, Andrew Tracy. He was reelected in 1862, receiving 29,543 votes; his nearest competitor, B. H. Smalley, only received 3,772 votes. In his second inaugural address, Governor Holbrook said \\"It is gratifying to realize that at each and every call of our country, in her hour of peril, thousands of the young men of our State have willingly and eagerly seized arms and have gone or are going forth to battle for the Union.\\"Crockett, Walter Hill, Vermont The Green Mountain State, New York: The Century History Company, Inc., 1921, iii:522, 547-548 Civil War Governor Holbrook served as governor during what many consider the darkest days of the American Civil War. His administration saw the recruitment of 10 infantry regiments, 2 light artillery batteries, and 3 sharpshooter companies. Under his administration, as well, Vermont built three military hospitals in the state which were \\"soon credited by the United States medical inspector with perfecting a larger percentage of cures than any United States military hospital record elsewhere could show.\\"Nancy E. Boone and Michael Sherman, \\"Designed to Cure: Civil War Hospitals in Vermont,\\" Vermont History, Winter 2001, 69:174 Retirement After his two terms as governor, he refused all further offers of public office, although he was diligently sought for a variety of positions. He returned to his farm and business interests, including serving as president of the Vermont Savings Bank. He was president of the board of trustees of the Vermont Asylum for the Insane for more than 40 years. Death He died in Brattleboro on April 28, 1909, and was buried at Prospect Hill Cemetery in Brattleboro. Family On January 13, 1835 Holbrook married to Harriet Goodhue, daughter of Joseph and Sarah Goodhue of Brattleboro. They were the parents of Franklin F. Holbrook, William C. Holbrook, and John Holbrook. Legacy The Deacon John Holbrook House built on Linden Street in Brattleboro by Holbrook's father still stands and is on the National Register of Historic Places.

Macmillan) Baby Island is a children's novel by Carol Ryrie Brink, first published in 1937. It resembles Robinson Crusoe in that the protagonists Mary and Jean are stranded on a desert island ‚Äì but with four babies. The novel was republished many times over the next several decades.Editions of Baby Island at WorldCat Plot summary The book begins with the Wallace sisters, twelve-year-old Mary and ten-year-old Jean, traveling alone on a ship to meet their father in Australia. The girls often babysit young children: at home, they had enjoyed \\"borrowing\\" the babies of neighbors. Their ship is disabled in a storm, and the two girls are set adrift in a lifeboat with four babies, the children of fellow passengers. The craft eventually drifts to a tropical island, and in a Robinson Crusoe-like scenario, they must learn to build shelter and survive on wild foodstuffs. They do this with great success, while raising the babies through various developmental milestones and adopting a baby monkey who they raise alongside the babies. Throughout the story, the girls sing \\"Scots Wha Hae\\" to inspire their courage to deal with their situation. In the latter part of the book the girls also encounter a character like Friday: a mysterious, gruff man who lives alone on the island and dislikes children. He eventually warms to their babies, and they enjoy his company and his useful craftsmanship. Finally, the girls are rescued on Christmas Day, after a storm, and all the babies are returned to their parents. They miss the Friday.

He played together with his brother, Fritz Walter, at the club 1. FC Kaiserslautern. They also played together for the Germany national football team in the 1954 FIFA World Cup. Walter scored four goals in the tournament as West Germany won their first ever World Cup title. In total, Walter earned 20 caps and scored 10 goals for Germany. For his club 1. FC Kaiserslautern he scored an unequaled 336 goals in 321 league and cup matches. Walter debuted in the first team at the age of 18 in 1942 as an outside left in a 7‚Äì1 rout of 1. FC Kaiserslautern against SV Waldhof Mannheim. During World War II, Walter was drafted into the Kriegsmarine and suffered heavy injuries in his right knee. After several operations, he was forced to end his career in 1958. Career Club career Born in Kaiserslautern, Walter and his two brothers Fritz and Ludwig all joined local club, 1. FC Kaiserslautern. After making his debut for the club in 1942 he was posted by the navy to Kiel, where he played for Holstein Kiel. By the late-1940s, Walter was the center forward of 1. FC Kaiserslautern. Like his brother Fritz, he treated the ball elegantly and was also pacy and possessed a powerful shot. As a center forward he also often moved to the wing. Post- football After the end of his career, he concentrated on operating a gas station which he had taken at rent in 1954. When the contract was signed, Walter had failed to notice the fine print in the contract which determined that if the contract got withdrawn, the gas station and the goods on the ground of the gas station would subrogate to the new leaseholder. This happened in 1969 and in consequence of this Walter tried to commit suicide. However, he survived and later described that attempted suicide as a \\"panic reaction\\". Later Walter found a job as an employee of the city of Kaiserslautern. He died 16 June 2013.

Compressor vs pump Hydrogen compressors are closely related to hydrogen pumps and gas compressors: both increase the pressure on a fluid and both can transport the fluid through a pipe. As gases are compressible, the compressor also reduces the volume of hydrogen gas, whereas the main result of a pump raising the pressure of a liquid is to allow the liquid hydrogen to be transported elsewhere.  Types   Reciprocating piston compressors  A proven method to compress hydrogen is to apply reciprocating piston compressors. Widely used in refineries, they are the backbone of refining crude oil. Reciprocating piston compressors are commonly available as either oil-lubricated or non-lubricated; for high pressure (350 - 700 bar), non- lubricated compressors are preferred to avoid oil contamination of the hydrogen. Typical drive power is in the order of magnitude of Megawatts (2-15MW). Expert know-how on piston sealing and packing rings can ensure that reciprocating compressors outperform the competing technologies in terms of MTBO (Mean Time Between Overhaul).  Ionic liquid piston compressor  An ionic liquid piston compressor is a hydrogen compressor based on an ionic liquid piston instead of a metal piston as in a piston-metal diaphragm compressor.New developments in pumps and compressors using Ionic Liquids Electrochemical hydrogen compressor A multi-stage electrochemical hydrogen compressor incorporates a series of membrane-electrode-assemblies (MEAs), similar to those used in proton exchange membrane fuel cells; this type of compressor has no moving parts and is compact. The electrochemical compressor works similar to a fuel cell, a voltage is applied to the membrane and the resulting electric current pulls hydrogen through the membrane. With electrochemical compression of hydrogen, a pressure of 14500 psi (1000bar or 100MPa) is achieved. A patent is pending claiming an exergy efficiency of 70 to 80% for pressures up to 10,000 psi or 700 bars.Electrochemical hydrogen compressor A single stage electrochemical compression to 800 bar was reported in 2011.HyET, Hydrogen Efficiency Technologies BV, achieves electro-chemical compression of hydrogen up to a pressure of 800 Bar DOE has supported developments related to developing low cost electrochemical hydrogen compressors for heat pumps with Xergy Inc.  Hydride compressor  In a hydride compressor, thermal and pressure properties of a hydride are used to absorb low-pressure hydrogen gas at ambient temperatures and then release high-pressure hydrogen gas at higher temperatures; the bed of hydride is heated with hot water or an electric coil.Hydride compressor  Piston-metal diaphragm compressor  Piston-metal diaphragm compressors are stationary high-pressure compressors, four-staged water-cooled, 11‚Äì15 kW, 30‚Äì50 Nm3/h 40 MPa for dispensation of hydrogen.Piston-metal diaphragm compressor Since compression generates heat, the compressed gas is to be cooled between stages making the compression less adiabatic and more isothermal. The default assumption on diaphragm hydrogen compressors is an adiabatic efficiency of 70%. Efficiency and performance measurement of a pdc single stage diaphragm hydrogen compressor-Pag.32 Used in hydrogen stations.  Guided rotor compressor  The guided rotor compressor (GRC) is a positive-displacement rotary compressor based upon an envoluted trochoid geometry which utilizes a parallel trochoid curve to define its basic compression volume.GRC - Detailed description and defining geometryHydrogen delivery liquefaction & compression It has a typical 80 to 85% adiabatic efficiency.  Linear compressor  The single-piston linear compressor uses dynamic counterbalancing, where an auxiliary movable mass is flexibly attached to a movable piston assembly and to the stationary compressor casing using auxiliary mechanical springs with zero vibration export at minimum electrical power and current consumed by the motor.Valved linear compressor It is used in cryogenics See also *Compressed hydrogen *Hydrogen turboexpander-generator *High pressure electrolysis *Hydrogen embrittlement *Hydrogen tank *Hydrogen leak testing References External links * 2004-Osti Hybrid Compressor-Expander * Gas compressors Hydrogen technologies Industrial gases ","title":"Hydrogen compressor"},{"id":"6402531","text":"A deep trefoil knot in a Thermus thermophilus RNA methyltransferase domain (PDB ID 1IPA).

The yeast ribosome synthesis factor Emg1 is a novel member of the superfamily of alpha/beta knot fold methyltransferases. Nucleic Acids Res 36(2):629-39 In many cases the trefoil knot is part of the active site or a ligand-binding site and is critical to the activity of the enzyme in which it appears. Before the discovery of the first knotted protein, it was believed that the process of protein folding could not efficiently produce deep knots in protein backbones. Studies of the folding kinetics of a dimeric protein from Haemophilus influenzae have revealed that the folding of trefoil knot proteins may depend on proline isomerization.Mallam AL, Jackson SE. (2006). Probing nature's knots: the folding pathway of a knotted homodimeric protein. J Mol Biol 359(5):1420-36 Computational algorithms have been developed to identify knotted protein structures, both to canvas the Protein Data Bank for previously undetected natural knots and to identify knots in protein structure predictions, where they are unlikely to accurately reproduce the native-state structure due to the rarity of knots in known proteins.Khatib F, Weirauch MT, Rohl CA. (2006). Rapid knot detection and application to protein structure prediction. Bioinformatics 22(14):e252-9 Currently, there is a web server pKNOT available to detect knots in proteins as well as to provide information on knotted proteins in the Protein Data Bank.Lai YL, Yen SC, Yu SH, Hwang JK (2007). pKNOT: the protein KNOT web server. Nucleic Acids Research 35:W420-424 Knottins are small, diverse and stable proteins with important drug design potential. They can be classified in 30 families which cover a wide range of sequences (1621 sequenced), three-dimensional structures (155 solved) and functions (> 10). Inter knottin similarity lies mainly between 20% and 40% sequence identity and 1.5 to 4 A backbone deviations although they all share a tightly knotted disulfide core. This important variability is likely to arise from the highly diverse loops which connect the successive knotted cysteines. The prediction of structural models for all knottin sequences would open new directions for the analysis of interaction sites and to provide a better understanding of the structural and functional organization of proteins sharing this scaffold.(Jerome Gracy and Laurent Chiche (2010). Optimizing structural modeling for a specific protein scaffold: knottins or inhibitor cystine knots.

Background Although the family home of the Duke of Leinster was Carton House near Maynooth, County Kildare (Ireland), FitzGerald was born at Harrington House, Northamptonshire (England), the home of his mother. He was the third son of Augustus FitzGerald, 3rd Duke of Leinster, by his wife Lady Charlotte Augusta Stanhope, daughter of General Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl of Harrington. Charles FitzGerald, 4th Duke of Leinster, was his elder brother.thepeerage.com Rt. Hon. Lord Otho Augustus FitzGerald Another brother, Gerald Fitzgerald (1821‚Äì1886) was, like Otho, an amateur composer and a noted artist. Political career Fitzgerald was an officer in the Royal Horse Guards and served as a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. He entered the House of Commons in 1865 as member for Kildare, a seat he held until 1874. In 1866 he was sworn of the Privy Council and made Treasurer of the Household under Lord Russell, a post he only held until the fall of the Liberal government in June of that year. He returned to office as Comptroller of the Household under William Gladstone in 1868, a post he retained until the government fell in 1874. Fitzgerald died at Bray, Berkshire. Family Lord Otho married Ursula Lucy Grace Bridgeman, daughter of Vice Admiral Charles Orlando Bridgeman and widow of Lord Londesborough, on 14 December 1861. This was regarded by his contemporaries as a fortune-hunting match. They had two children: *Major Gerald Otho FitzGerald (25 September 1862 ‚Äì 20 March 1919), unmarried and without issue. *Ina Blanche Georgie FitzGerald (12 January 1864 ‚Äì 6 July 1910), married on 29 January 1885 Major Arthur Leopold Paget (19 August 1856 ‚Äì 1 March 1906).

It replaced the former position of Superintendent of Finances (Surintendant des finances), which was abolished with the downfall of Nicolas Fouquet. It did not hold any real political power until 1665, when First Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who had acted upon financial matters since Fouquet's embezzlement charge, was appointed to the office. History The term \\"contr√¥leur g√©n√©ral\\" in reference to a position of royal accounting and financial oversight had existed in various forms prior to 1547, but the direct predecessor to the 17th century \\"Controller-General\\" was created in 1547, with two position-holders whose job was to verify the accounts of the Royal Treasurer (Tr√©sorier de l'√âchiquier), then the head of the royal financial system. The name of the charge of the controllers came from their account book, or contre-r√¥le (literally \\"counter-roll\\", meaning scroll copy), in which they kept their accounts in order to compare them with those of the Royal Treasurer. The office was thus, in the beginning, not a senior rank governmental position, but merely an accounting audit charge. In the period following 1547, the financial administration in France continued to evolve, resulting in 1552 in the creation of Intendants of Finances (Intendants des Finances), of which one was to become in 1561 the leading Superintendent of Finances (Surintendant des Finances) with cabinet rank. In 1661, the last Superintendent of Finances, Nicolas Fouquet, was arrested by order of King Louis XIV and charged with embezzlement, so that subsequently Jean-Baptiste Colbert became head of the royal financial and tax collection administration, at first with the title of intendant g√©n√©ral, then, from 1665, with the title of Contr√¥leur g√©n√©ral des Finances. The title Superintendent of Finances was abolished. Under Colbert's competent and dynamic administration, the Controller-General's responsibilities were greatly redefined. King Louis XIV suppressed the two already existing positions holding the title of Controller-General as he wanted to replace these with a sole homonym office with cabinet rank in charge of all the finances and taxes of France. Furthermore, this new position was no longer transmissible as the head of state could revoke the respective commission at his pleasure at any time. In addition, the new position was far better connected with the Royal Finance Counsel (Conseil royal des finances) than the previous charge of Superintendent. In these ways, the Contr√¥leur g√©n√©ral des Finances became a true senior governmental post. The function of Controller-General would continue until 1791, with an interruption at the era of the Polysynody (1715‚Äì1718) under the regency of Philippe d'Orl√©ans during the childhood of King Louis XV, when all ministerial offices were replaced by councils composed of members of the high aristocracy. Occasionally, the de facto Minister of Finance served instead as President of the Royal Council of Finance, who had a superior rank to a mere Controller-General of Finances, or, in the case of Jacques Necker, who, being a Protestant, could not serve as Controller-General, as Director-General of Finances and of the Treasury (Directeur g√©n√©ral du Tr√©sor royal and Directeur g√©n√©ral des Finances from 1776 to 1781 anf again from 1788 until 1790), in ceremonial terms a position ranked below the previous two. The position was renamed Minister of Finances in 1791 which, along with all other ministerial positions, was abolished in 1794, but restored with the advent of the French Directory in 1795. Nowadays the position is called (with exceptions) Ministre de l'√âconomie et des Finances (Minister of the Economy and Finance). Responsibilities The responsibilities of the Controller-General were the most extensive of all the administrative positions of the Ancien R√©gime. According to the official description of 1665, the Controller-General had the power \\"to report in our Counsel of all affairs which are of concern to our service and of any others\\" (\\"faire rapport en notre Conseil de toutes les affaires qui concerneront notre service et de toutes autres indiff√©remment\\"). Colbert, first of the Controllers-General with subsequent power, was also head of two other senior government posts equivalent to present-day ministers (from a total of six): Secretary of State of the Navy and Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi (Royal Household), both from 1669 till his death in 1683. In addition to those cabinet posts, he had also several important posts as administration chief, such as Surintendant des Manufactures et B√¢timents du Roi (Superintendent of the King's Manufacturers and Buildings; 1664‚Äì1683). The Controller-General's responsibilities were manifold: * the control of State expenditures * the control of State revenues (taxes and fees) * the control of external and internal customs (traites) * the management of the national economy * the control of manufacturers and merchants * the management of most of the civil services and public infrastructure, including bridges and roads (ponts et chauss√©es), ports and canals * the control of the merchant navy The position was very well paid: in addition to 200 000 livres tournois (French pounds) by year (the average income of a worker was about 250 to 300 livres per year), the Controller-General could also gain 20 000 livres as Minister of State, not to forget the bribes he would receive during the renewal phase of contracts to the Ferme G√©n√©rale (\\"General Lease\\", meaning the selling to private companies or individuals of the time-limited right to collect all the indirect taxes plus bonus fees in a defined portion of the country, an extremely lucrative business for the leaseholders). The Controller-General participated in a number of the King's Councils. He was always member of the Conseil des d√©p√™ches (\\"Counsel of messages\\", which dealt with the news from the provinces), the \\"Royal Finance Counsel\\" (Conseil royal des finances) and the \\"Royal Commerce Counsel\\" (Conseil royal de commerce). He was nearly always a Minister of State (the highest ceremonial rank for a cabinet member), which allowed him to attend the \\"High Counsel\\" also known as the \\"State Counsel\\" (Conseil d'en haut or Conseil d'√âtat, the paramount institution of the royal government). In the French language exists only one word for the English words \\"Council\\" and \\"Counsel\\": Conseil. Therefore one can find in the literature both English words as translations of the French Conseil names. The Controller-General was generally chosen from among the regionally based Intendants of Finances or from the Ma√Ætres des requ√™tes (literally \\"Master of Requests\\", an earlier form of public prosecutor). Of all ministerial positions, the Controller-General was the least stable, especially during the reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI, to such a point that the Controller- General's official seat was called the \\"Residence of Removals\\" (\\"h√¥tel des d√©m√©nagements\\"). Organisation Unlike other government departments of the French monarchy, the Contr√¥le G√©n√©ral des Finances was organised in a highly systematic manner. It was divided into several services under the immediate authority of the Controller-General. However, he named for each service a senior managing assistant who was initially called Intendant des Finances, a title which was later replaced by Intendant g√©n√©ral des Finances or Directeur g√©n√©ral des Finances in order to avoid any confusion with the Intendants des Finances established in the different regions of France. There were between three and twelve of these senior aids in financial and fiscal matters during the Ancien R√©gime (six at the end of the 18th century shortly before the Revolution). In the same way, the Controller-General was assisted by four and, later five, Intendants (g√©n√©raux) du Commerce. The Contr√¥le G√©n√©ral had a rather large personnel staff compared to other government departments. The central services were either in Paris (notably at the Palais Mazarin, Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs), close to the bankers and financiers that the ministry dealt with, or at the Royal Palace in Versailles. However, the important collaborators of the Controller-General were the Intendants established in the different regions of France. Initially the King had been represented in the provinces by the Governors (Gouverneurs) and since 1620 by the Intendants who at first were only in charge of the collection of direct taxes and of regional public finances. Traditionally, the Governors were chosen by the King from the ranks of the highest aristocracy. Nevertheless, as they had occasionally challenged the royal authority in their respective regions, the Kings responded by retaining them as often as possible at the Royal Palace, so that the function of Governor finally became only a ceremonial title. As a consequence, the real power in the regions shifted towards the Intendant, who since 1666 had the official title of \\"Intendent of Police, Justice and Finances and Commissioner sent in the G√©n√©ralit√©s of the Realm for the Execution of the King's Orders\\" (Intendant de police, justice et finances, Commissaire d√©parti dans les g√©n√©ralit√©s du royaume pour l'ex√©cution des ordres du Roi), or in short Intendant (de g√©n√©ralit√©). There were 33 of them, each one at the head of a G√©n√©ralit√©, which at first was simply a tax collection district of France, but became more and more a general administration province of the royal government. Subsequently the Intendants saw their powers and competences increased at such a level, that they were nicknamed \\"the right hand of the King in the province\\".

They have released seven full-length albums, 2 EPs and a remix album, earning generally positive reviews. The band has earned some attention due to many of their songs being featured in the soundtracks of Gary Hustwit's design documentaries Helvetica, Objectified, and Urbanized. The name El Ten Eleven is derived from the name of an airliner, the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar. Career 2002-2007 Bassist and composer Kristian Dunn and drummer Tim Fogarty formed El Ten Eleven in 2002 while living in the Silver Lake community of Los Angeles. They released their eponymous debut album, El Ten Eleven in 2004 on Fake Record Label, and through Bar/None Records on September 20, 2005. Many reviews of the album garnished the band with positive acclaim. Comparisons have been drawn to Sigur R√≥s and The Mercury Program, though reviews have heavily emphasized the duo's utilization of a limited number of musicians to create complex instrumental works. The Dallas Observer called them the fourth best instrumental band in the last twenty years. Spin, which awarded them the title 'Band of the Day', September 29, 2005, describes their work as \\"experimental instrumental music that's both highly skilled and deeply felt.\\" 2005 also saw the band embark on their first US tour. This was the beginning of the band playing for years, almost non-stop, around the country. SF Weekly remarked of their live show, \\"Watching El Ten Eleven play is something like watching two superheroes do their thing.‚Äù Regarding their live show, Kristian commented to the Scenestar in 2012, \\"We refuse to use prerecorded tracks or click tracks live, so getting through one of our shows is quite difficult!\\" In 2007, the movie Helvetica was released with original music by Kristian Dunn, and much of the contributed music performed by the duo. Their second album was also released that year, on CD format July 9, and then available later for download that August. A music video was also shot that year for the song \\"Hot Cakes\\", directed by video producer and writer Adam Hauck. In late 2007, Xtal Records released the band's second full-length album, Every Direction Is North in Japan, a version which included the bonus track \\"Jumping Frenchmen Of Maine.\\" In a January 28, 2008 blog post on their website, and MySpace page, the band released \\"Jumping Frenchmen of Maine\\" as an online download, stating that the song was from their forthcoming album. A PayPal link was included for listeners, giving them the option to pay any amount they wished for the song, much like what Radiohead had done with In Rainbows in 2007. 2008-2010 On July 15, 2008 the band released their third album, These Promises Are Being Videotaped, a more dance oriented outing. The record was recorded using only fretless bass and electronic and acoustic drums. The band released their fourth studio album, It's Still Like a Secret, on November 9, 2010. 2011-2013 Their fifth album, Transitions, was released on October 2, 2012. Transitions Remixed was released on April 2, 2013. It features remixes of songs from Transitions by electronic artists Com Truise, Slow Magic, D33J and Steed Lord, among others, and reached #13 on the CMJ college radio chart. 2014-present On February 4, 2014 the band released For emily, a three-song EP dedicated to a friend who died the previous year. The word Emily is purposely not capitalized as that is the way she would write her name. On July 18, 2014, the duo announced an Indiegogo campaign to fund the pressing of new vinyl records for their original album El Ten Eleven, Transitions, and a new pressing for For emily. For this fundraiser, fans could order any of vinyls for these three albums, the original test pressing records for these albums, or pay to be on the band's official guest list for life. Also, the For emily EP included an additional bonus track not available digitally called Favrile. The fundraiser ended on August 3, 2014.

It became one of his most popular and influential songs. It is based on earlier blues songs, and numerous artists later interpreted it. Background Wolf had performed \\"Smokestack Lightning\\" in one form or another at least by the early 1930s, when he was performing with Charley Patton in small Delta communities. The song, called \\"a hypnotic one-chord drone piece\\", draws on earlier blues, such as Tommy Johnson's \\"Big Road Blues\\" (1928, Victor 21279), the Mississippi Sheiks' \\"Stop and Listen Blues\\" (1930, OKeh 8807), and Charley Patton's \\"Moon Going Down\\" (1930, Paramount 13014). Wolf said the song was inspired by watching trains in the night: \\"We used to sit out in the country and see the trains go by, watch the sparks come out of the smokestack. That was smokestack lightning.\\" In 1951, he recorded the song as \\"Crying at Daybreak\\". It contains the line \\"O-oh smokestack lightnin', shinin', just like gold, oh don't you hear me cryin'\\", similar to the Mississippi Sheiks' lyric \\"A-ah, smokestack lightnin', that bell shine just like gold, now don't you hear me talkin'\\". Original song In Chicago in January 1956, Howlin' Wolf recorded \\"Smokestack Lightning\\". The song takes the form of \\"a propulsive, one-chord vamp, nominally in E major but with the flatted blue notes that make it sound like E minor\\", and lyrically it is \\"a pastiche of ancient blues lines and train references, timeless and evocative\\". Longtime Wolf guitarist Hubert Sumlin is credited with the distinctive guitar line. Howlin' Wolf sang and played harmonica, backed by pianist Hosea Lee Kennard, guitarists Willie JohnsonWillie Johnson or Pat Hare played on the earlier \\"Crying at Daybreak\\". and Hubert Sumlin, bassist Willie Dixon, and drummer Earl Phillips. In 1956, \\"Smokestack Lightning\\" reached number 11 in the Billboard R&B; chart. When it was released by Pye International Records in the UK in 1964, it peaked at number 42 in the singles chart. It was later included on the albums Moanin' in the Moonlight and The Howlin' Wolf Album. Accolades \\"Smokestack Lightning\\" received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999, honoring its lasting historical significance. It is ranked number 291 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \\"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\". In 1985, the song was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in the \\"Classics of Blues Recordings\\" category. It is also included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame list of the \\"500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll\\". In 2009, \\"Smokestack Lightning\\" was selected for permanent preservation in the National Recording Registry of the U.S. Library of Congress. Recordings by other artists \\"Smokestack Lightning\\" has been interpreted numerous times by various artists. In the early to mid-1960s, it became a live staple of British beat groups, including the Yardbirds, Manfred Mann, the Animals, the Groundhogs, and the Who as well as American groups, such as Grateful Dead, Quicksilver Messenger Service, the Electric Prunes, Kaleidoscope and the Wailers. The song has also been performed or recorded by Muddy Waters, Jimmy Rogers, Fenton Robinson, Lucky Peterson, John Lee Hooker, John Mayer, Bob Dylan, Gillan, Mike Harrison, Soundgarden, Widespread Panic, moe., Gov't Mule, Lester Butler, George Thorogood, Aerosmith, Bintangs, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Gun Club, Blues Creation and Big Head Todd and the Monsters.

It was created in the late 1880s at the request of the Japanese aristocracy to cater to the increasing number of Western visitors to Japan. The hotel site is located just south of the Imperial Palace grounds, next to the previous location of the Palace moat. The modern hotel overlooks the Palace, the Western-style Hibiya Park, and the Yurakucho and Ginza neighborhoods. Three main buildings have stood on the hotel site, each of which embodied the finest Western design of its era. Including annexes, there have been at least 10 structures that have been part of the Imperial Hotel, including two designed by Frank Lloyd Wright: *The original Imperial Hotel, designed by Yuzuru Watanabe (1890‚Äì1922) *Hotel Metropole in Tsukiji, purchased as an annex (1906‚Äì1910) *First Imperial Hotel annex (1906‚Äì1919) *A temporary annex, designed by Wright when the original hotel annex burnt (1920‚Äì1923) *New Imperial Hotel main building, designed by Wright (1922‚Äì1967) *1954 Imperial Hotel annex (1954‚Äì1979) *1958 Imperial Hotel annex (1958‚Äì1979) *Imperial Hotel parking structure (1969‚Äìpresent) *Third (and current) main building, which replaced the Frank Lloyd Wright main building (1970‚Äìpresent) *Imperial Tower, which replaced the 1954 and 1958 annexes (1983‚Äìpresent)  History   First Imperial Hotel: 1890‚Äì1922  The original Imperial Hotel, designed by Yuzuru Watanabe (1890s) The original Imperial Hotel opened in November 1890 on the Northeast corner of what is now the hotel property. The hotel faced roughly North, with parts of the Imperial Palace moats (no longer extant) across streets on the North and East sides of the building. The hotel was backed by key Japanese leaders, such as Foreign Minister Count Inoue Kaoru and Viscount Shibusawa Eiichi. Shibusawa and Okura Kihachiro submitted an application to form the Tokyo Hotel Co. on November 28, 1887, in order to \\"build a large hotel in Tokyo and to conduct the business of renting rooms to foreign guests, and for parties and other events...\\". There were initially 21 investors, with the largest (21.15%) being the Imperial Household Ministry. Site preparation for the hotel started in July 1888, and construction began in the fall of that year. On 7 July 1890 the name was changed to Imperial Hotel Ltd. The hotel was opened in November 1890. Plans for the hotel were part of the effort to centralize government offices in the Hibiya area. A group of German architects visited Japan and made some preliminary drawings. The initial drawings for the hotel were created by Heinrich M√§nz, in the German neo-Renaissance style. In 1886, a group of 20 Japanese were sent to Germany for training. Eventually, Yuzuru Watanabe would be picked to design the 60-room hotel, which would also be known as \\"Watanabe House\\". Watanabe used the original layout by M√§nz, but because of soil conditions, changed the four story stone structure to a three-story wood frame and brick structure, with the exterior painted to look like stone. He also added rooms under the eaves to accommodate more guests. Western (French) food had been the official banquet fare of the Imperial Palace since Emperor Meiji hosted a luncheon for the nephew of the king of Italy on 8 September 1873, and the Imperial Hotel followed that tradition. Japan's first Diet building, just finished on 24 November 1890 in time for the first Diet session, burned down on 20 January 1891. After a week of preparations, the House of Peers reconvened in the ballroom of the Imperial Hotel, where they would meet until March 1. Business was slow at first, and the hotel lost money. Even after the U.S. annexed the Philippines in 1902 After the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican and the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, bringing more travelers through Japan, the hotel only averaged 40 guests and 50 restaurant customers. It was not until the start of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 that the hotel was regularly filled to capacity. In 1906 a 42-room annex was built and the Hotel Metropole in Tsukiji was purchased to increase capacity, allowing the hotel to serve up to 150 resident guests and seat up to 200 for dinner and banquets. The Metropole was torn down in 1910, as planning began for a new building to be completed by 1916. Watanabe's Imperial Hotel building was destroyed by fire on 16 April 1922, while Edward, Prince of Wales was visiting Japan. The fire broke out during the day, with a full staff on hand and most of the guests out at an Imperial garden party. No lives were lost, but business at the hotel stopped until the South wing of the new hotel could be opened.  Second Imperial Hotel: 1923‚Äì1968  The entrance courtyard of Wright's Imperial Hotel designed in the Maya Revival Style. The second Imperial Hotel was built from 1919‚Äì1923, and officially opened on 1 September 1923. This hotel was the best- known of Frank Lloyd Wright's buildings in Japan. It was designed roughly in the shape of its own logo, with the guest room wings forming the letter \\"H\\", while the public rooms were in a smaller but taller central wing shaped like the letter \\"I\\" that cut through the middle of the \\"H\\". Peacock Chair, designed for the hotel.  Preliminaries  In 1911, Frank Lloyd Wright was recommended to Aisaku Hayashi of the Imperial Hotel by Frederick W. Gookin, a fellow collector of Japanese art. By 1912, Wright was corresponding directly with Hayashi, but the death of Emperor Meiji put a hold on discussions. When discussions resumed, Wright traveled to Japan, leaving the United States on 11 January 1913. During his stay, Wright examined the site and drew some preliminary plans. He returned to the United States in May confident that he would get the commission. In early 1916, Hayashi, his wife, and Japanese architect Tori Yoshitake traveled to the United States, arriving at Taliesin in February. In addition to going over plan details before submitting them to the Hotel Board of Directors for final approval, the trip seems to have been made for Hayashi to see some of Wright's work in person, and to see how American hotels were run. Hayashi and his companions were back in Japan by mid-April, and the board had approved the plans in time for Wright to sail for Japan on 28 December 1916. The purpose of the 1917 visit (Wright arrived on January 9 and left on April 21) was to prepare for construction‚Äîexamine the site more thoroughly, make arrangements for materials, and hire draftsmen to make the working drawings. Wright was back at Taliesin by mid-May. Initial working drawings were all done at Taliesin, and Wright would not return to Japan until 17 November 1918 to supervise the start of construction.  Construction  In late 1919, when work had just begun on the new hotel, the 1906 Imperial Hotel annex burnt to the ground. Work on the new hotel was stopped while Wright designed a temporary annex, which was opened 5 months later. On 26 April 1922, the worst earthquake (6.8) in decades struck Tokyo. While many buildings in the area were destroyed and the remains of the first Imperial Hotel were toppled, the hotel itself‚Äîwhile shaken‚Äîstood completely undamaged. Wright was working on the upper floor of the building at the time, and feared the worst when he heard a huge crash, but this turned out to just be the five chimneys from the first Imperial Hotel, which had burnt down just 10 days earlier. The North wing of the new hotel and a partially completed center section opened on 2 July 1922, in time to host the reunion of the Annapolis class of 1881. At this point, estimates were that it would only take about 6 weeks to complete the hotel, and since the South wing was a mirror image of the North, Wright decided that he could leave the completion to be supervised by Arata Endo. Wright left Japan on 22 July 1922, never to return. The hotel took another 11 months to complete, and officially opened in June 1923.http://www.oldtokyo.com/imperial-hotel-wright/ The Frank Lloyd Wright annex (one of six Wright designs for Japan that was actually built) was destroyed in the Great Kant≈ç earthquake on 1 September 1923, although by that time it was no longer in use.  Architecture  thumbrightFinal perspective drawing by Wright. Over 700 drawings were created for this project. The Frank Lloyd Wright version was designed in the Maya Revival Style of architecture. It incorporates a tall, pyramid-like structure, and also loosely copies Maya motifs in its decorations. The main building materials are poured concrete, concrete block, and carved oya stone. The visual effect of the hotel was stunning and dramatic, though not unique; in recent years, architectural historians have noted a marked similarity with the Cafe Australia in Melbourne, Australia (1916), designed by Prairie School architects Marion Mahony and Walter Burley Griffin. The architecture heavily influenced the style of the K≈çshien Hotel, which was constructed by Wright's apprentice Arata Endo.  1923 Great Tokyo earthquake  the 1923 earthquake (on the right burning is the Kangy≈ç Bank) Shortly after the earthquake (the Imperial is seen in the top right) The structure famously survived the Great Kant≈ç earthquake on September 1, 1923 (7.9 on the Moment magnitude scale (Mw)). A telegram from Baron Kihachiro Okura reported the following: Wright passed the telegram to journalists, helping to perpetuate a legend that the hotel was unaffected by the earthquake. In reality, the building had been damaged; the central section slumped, several floors bulged, four pieces of stonework fell to the ground, fans fell from the balcony, and electric ranges in the kitchen were toppled, starting a kitchen fire that was fairly quickly extinguished. It was also not the only building to survive, or the least damaged. On the insurance company damage scale (1‚Äì5), it was in the second best (light damage) category. According to the Tokyo Building Inspection Department, about 19% of the brick buildings and 20% of the steel and reinforced concrete buildings in the city were categorized in the best category (no damage) and thus performed better than the Imperial. The building's main failing was its foundation. Wright had intended the hotel to float on the site's alluvial mud \\"as a battleship floats on water\\", even during an earthquake. This was accomplished by making it shallow, with broad footings. However, this proved an inadequate support and did not prevent the building from sinking into the mud to such an extent that it had to be demolished decades later. Furthermore, alluvial mud, such as that at the hotel's site, amplifies seismic waves. However, the hotel had several design features that minimized potential earthquake damage: * Seismic separation joints, located about every along the building; * Tapered walls, thicker on lower floors, increasing their strength; * Cantilevered floors and balconies provided extra support for the floors; * Suspended piping and wiring, instead of being encased in concrete, as well as smooth curves, making them more resistant to fracture; * A copper roof eliminated the risk of falling debris created by traditional tile roofs; * The reflecting pool provided a source of water for fire-fighting, saving the building from the post-earthquake firestorm. After the earthquake and subsequent fire, the Hotel temporarily hosted the American, British, French, and Italian embassies, as well as the Chinese and Swedish Ministers. The Grill Room, as well as some exterior space behind the hotel, was allocated to storage of relief supplies. The front entrance to the new South wing was given over for use by public utilities, and the press was given the banquet hall entrance and the promenade leading to the banquet hall. Until electric and water were restored, cooking was done outside, first on campfires, then on charcoal grills. For the first four days after the earthquake, the hotel fed all comers for free, up to 2,500 people twice daily. After that, the hotel charged only cost until the emergency was over. Electricity was restored to the hotel in September 4, and water on September 5. Relief supplies from other countries started arriving in Tokyo, and to the hotel, on September 3 with the arrival of the destroyer USS Stewart. In 1930, the K≈çshien Hotel was constructed under the plans of Arata Endo, a disciple of Wright. The design was inspired by the Imperial Hotel.  World War II  By 1936, Japan was preparing for the 1940 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, and there was serious talk of replacing Wright's Imperial Hotel with a building more suited to the needs of the time. With only 280 rooms, the hotel was no longer financially viable. World War II intervened to cancel the Olympics and save the hotel from the wrecking ball. During World War II, the South wing of the hotel was gutted by incendiary bombs on 25 May 1945, and the Peacock room was destroyed. The hotel asked Wright to come back and design the repairs to the hotel, but Wright refused. The hotel was commandeered for a period by the Allied occupation forces and managed by the U.S. government, under the supervision of Lieutenant J. Malcolm Morris, from 1945 to 1952, and some of the damage was repaired during this time.  Postwar  As part of the land reform instituted by the occupying forces under General Douglas MacArthur, Okura Kishichiro and all of his family had to give up their shares in the Imperial Hotel. The same applied to the Imperial Household Agency, ending the financial involvement of the Imperial family in the hotel. The hotel was returned to its owners on 1 April 1952, and full repairs could be made. As the guest wings of the Wright building were only three stories tall, it actually had relatively few guest rooms. Once the war damage had been repaired, a new annex was constructed directly behind the North wing of Wright's building, opening on 1 December 1954 and adding 200 guest rooms to the hotel. Construction for a second annex of 450 guest rooms started on 17 November 1956, with the annex opening in June 1958.  Demolition  Entrance Hall, which was reconstructed in the Meiji Mura Museum The hotel eventually slipped into decay as time took its toll. In a controversial decision, it was decided in 1967 to demolish the old hotel and replace it with a high-rise structure. Reasons given for the demolition include the damage to the banquet section and South wing during World War II, uneven settling of the building on its floating foundation (some parts of the building had sunk as much as ), and damage to the decorative oya stone that was causing pieces to fall off. The second Imperial Hotel was closed on 15 November 1967, and demolition started shortly after.  Surviving portion  The entrance courtyard of Wright's Imperial Hotel, as recreated near Nagoya in the Meiji- Mura Museum While most of Wright's building was destroyed, the iconic central lobby wing and the reflecting pool were disassembled and rebuilt at The Museum Meiji-mura, a collection of buildings (mostly from the Meiji Era) in Inuyama, near Nagoya, where they are open to the public. Because the building structure was brick and concrete and could not be disassembled, as much of the oya stone as possible, tiles, and other finishing materials were preserved. Demolition of the hotel was completed and materials stored at Meiji-mura by March 1968. A site for the reconstruction was chosen in February 1970, and exterior reconstruction started in March, taking 6 years to complete. Interior reconstruction started in November 1983 after a 7-year pause, and was completed in October 1985, more than 17 years after the demolition.

At the October 16, 1966 board meeting, a plan to build a new hotel, to be completed in time for Expo '70 in Osaka, was unanimously approved. Ground was broken on February 28, 1968, just after demolition of the Wright building was completed. The 10 story parking garage just south of the annexes was completed before the new hotel, in 1969. The 1954 and 1958 annexes were torn down in 1979. Construction of a 31-story mixed-use tower of four floors of shops, 14 floors of offices, and 363 guest rooms on the top 12 floors began on December 25, 1979. The new tower opened on March 13, 1983. = Notable events = Princess Sayako (the third child and only daughter of Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko of Japan, now Sayako Kuroda), was married at the Hotel in 2005. In a reference to the three Edo era branch houses of the Tokugawa clan, the Imperial Hotel, Hotel Okura Tokyo, and Hotel New Otani Tokyo are often referred to as one of the of Tokyo.

Free as Air is an original story of two days in May on Terhou, a minor \\"and totally fictitious\\" Channel Island, based on Jethou, the private island leased at the time by Compton Mackenzie. Synopsis The islanders arise early to prepare for their annual Independence Day (I'm Up Early). They discover there is no young lady to be the Queen in their Coronation Ceremony because everyone has played the part before. Parliament (Lord Paul, Mr Mutch, Mr Potter) proposes a new law but the members are glad of an excuse to stop work (Let The Grass Grow). The Terhou boat returns from its monthly visit to the mainland bringing the usual imports‚Äîand a stranger, Geraldine (Nothing But Sea and Sky). The Islanders meet her and unload the boat (The Boat's In). Geraldine is welcomed as a possible solution to the coronation problem but her presence disturbs Molly, an island girl. Molly gazes past the horizon and yearns for a man as handsome as Geraldine is beautiful (A Man From The Mainland). Albert, Lord Paul's nephew, shows Geraldine round the island. She tells him she is wealthy and has run away from a suitor, Jack Amersham, and from the paparazzi, which have made her unwillingly famous. The Islanders legally adopt her and teach her the Coronation song (Free As Air). Geraldine feels safe but on Jersey her absence has been discovered by Jack Amersham and by Ivy Crush, the press reporter who has been detailed to shadow her. Jack lightly mourns Geraldine‚Äôs escape and of all the other girls in his life (Her Mummy Doesn't Like Me Any More). Meanwhile, Lord Paul has run away in a frenzy to Jersey: he has tried to propose to Miss Catamole and been laughed at and humiliated. Easy prey, he is persuaded to take Jack and Ivy to Terhou. Geraldine's privacy and the peace of Terhou are threatened (The Girl From London). The Island girls, led by Molly, fall in love with Jack on sight (A Man From The Mainland). Geraldine tells Jack she can never marry him and there is a gently growing sympathy between her and Albert (I'd Like To Be Like You). Lord Paul, captivated by Ivy's admiration of him, shows her round the Island. The Islanders sing her a folk song which tells the story of the Roman occupation (Testudo). Jack half- responds to Molly's uninhibited advances and consents to take her to London (I've Got My Feet On The Ground). Ivy almost persuades the Islanders to turn Terhou into a lucrative pleasure resort; Geraldine, Jack and Albert point out what their life would be like (Holiday Island) and the Islanders realise that Ivy is a menace and imprison her. But it is too late: she reveals that she has already reported to her newspaper and Geraldine, broken-hearted, leaves the island to save it from publicity. She meets the reporters on Jersey (Geraldine). The islanders appear, posing as Geraldine's relations among whom she has divided her money. The reporters think she is now penniless and lose interest. Geraldine is safe to return to Terhou. Mr. Potter, coached by Geraldine, has proposed to Miss Catamole after fifteen years' procrastination (We're Holding Hands). Ivy is forgiven and consents to marry Lord Paul. The Coronation Ceremony takes place with Geraldine as Queen (Terhou). Molly, after a glimpse of the mainland, decides to stay where she is; Jack leaves Terhou on his own.

Darrell Craig McClure (February 25, 1903 ‚Äì February 27, 1987), was an American cartoonist and illustrator best known for his work on the comic strip Little Annie Rooney from 1930 to 1966. The strip took its name from an 1890 song by Michael Nolan. McClure was born in Ukiah, California, where his mother was the painter Ethel Jamison Docker. At age nine, McClure moved with his family to San Francisco, where he went to art school at night, doing his first professional jobs at age 14. He was 17 when he began an apprenticeship in animated cartoons, and he studied at the California School of Fine Arts. After work in logging camps as a lumberjack, he was a sailor on commercial freighters in the Pacific, eventually traveling to New York City on a freighter.Dave Karlen Comic strips In New York, he took a job at King Features Syndicate in 1923 and studied under George Bridgman at the Art Student's League. He became a contributor to Yachting in 1924, married that same year and moved to Connecticut. Darrell McClure's Little Annie Rooney (October 21, 1964) In the late 1920s, his first strips, Vanilla and the Villains and Hard Hearted Hickey, appeared, followed by Donnie. In 1930, he took over Little Annie Rooney (except for Sundays) from two previous artists for the New York Journal. During the height of Little Annie Rooney's popularity, McClure built a house in Greenwich, Connecticut, home to many famous cartoonists, and he lived and worked there from 1939 to 1947. During World War II, he served part time with the Coast Guard. After his wife died in the 1940s, he moved to Florida, where he remarried a Navy widow in 1955, gaining a daughter and three grandchildren. In May and June 1956, the couple traveled in McClures' yacht from Fort Lauderdale to Connecticut, with stopovers at Charleston, Norfolk and Annapolis. Later, they relocated to San Francisco, where he spent time sailing and painting. As continuity adventure strips became less popular, McClure and Little Annie Rooney retired in 1966. He died in Talmage, California in 1987.Cauthen, Linda. \\"Comic Strip Artist Visits Yacht Basin\\", Charleston News and Courier, June 19, 1956.

With the start of the Pacific War, Iida was transferred south to take command of the Japanese 25th Army in Japanese- occupied French Indochina in 1941. He established his headquarters in Saigon and prepared for an invasion of Thailand. In December 1941, Iida took command of the newly formed Japanese Fifteenth Army, consisting of the IJA 33rd Division and IJA 55th Division. Beginning on 8 December, his forces easily overcame light Thai resistance, forcing Thailand into a mutual defense pact with Japan. On 20 January 1942, Iida's divisions crossed into Burma in the highly successful beginnings of the Burma Campaign.Latimer, Burma: The Forgotten War. Iida's 35,000 men quickly outmaneuvered British forces despite inclement terrain and limited supplies. On 8 March, Iida took Rangoon, cutting the Burma Road and isolating China.

It is north of Brisbane, the state capital. The closest major population centre is Caboolture, to the west. History The town name was approved by the Queensland Place Names Board on 1 October 1975. The name appears to be derived from a corroboree site, or because of fights amongst oyster gatherers at weekend camps. The town started out as a small fishing community but has since developed into a minor tourist destination. Pumicestone Post Office opened on 1 August 1958. It was renamed Donnybrook in 1976. In 1985, an unsealed road running along the waterfront was named Grant Lane after Robert Grant (1895 ‚Äì 15 November 1991) for his 90th birthday, a popular local who everyone knew as \\"Pop\\". A few years later the road was sealed after he had complained for years of the dust produced by all the passers-by. Sand mining and sewerage works have recently been proposed for the area.

Activities There are a number of activities in Donnybrook. Although commercial fishing has reduced the quantity and quality of catches, fishing remains a popular activity due to its proximity to Pumicestone Passage which opens up in Moreton Bay to the south, and Caloundra to the north. The passage separates Bribie Island from the mainland. It is frequented by dolphins, dugongs and turtles and parts of it have been declared a Marine Park. Mud crabs were once sizeable and in abundance. Camping and caravan sites are available. Water sports such as sailing and wind surfing are available along the passage, but normally require travelling to Bribie Island.

Career While serving in the Iranian Air Force, he participated in air strikes against the Iraqi Navy during Operation Morvarid in October 1980. He was valued for planning IRIAF operations missions against the Iraqi military with a high rate of success. During the Iran-Iraq war he petitioned Islamic Republic political leaders asking them to stop executing and arresting former Imperial Iranian Air Force pilots. Last mission In 1982, in an attempt to show the world that Iraq was stable and safe and has the upper hand in the war, Saddam Hussein planned to host the 7th Summit of the international Non-Aligned Movement in Baghdad.6th Summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement,page 96, item 309.

The character has appeared in books in particular those featuring the Thunderbolts and served as a recurring adversary for Iron Man. Publication history The character debut in Thunderbolts #3 (June 1997) and was created by Kurt Busiek and Mark Bagley. Her character was the third version behind the Crimson Cowl alias; Ultron having been the original depiction, Edwin Jarvis was framed as the first depiction by Ultron, and Dallas Riordan was framed as the third version by Justine. Kurt Busiek originally intended Alice Nugent (Hank Pym's former lab assistant) to be Crimson Cowl.Kurt Busiek's choice for the woman beneath the Crimson Cowl The next Thunderbolts writer Fabian Nicieza revealed that Justin Hammer's previously unknown daughter was the new version of Crimson Cowl. Nicieza would later use Alice Nugent as the new Doctor Spectrum. Fictional character biography Justine claims to be the daughter of industrialist and super villain financier Justin Hammer. Despite being the daughter of one of the richest men in the world, Justine's life was not one of privilege. Justin never approved of his daughter and Justine was always trying to prove her worthiness. Justine eventually decided to follow in her father's footsteps and use the supervillain community to accumulate power for herself. Shortly after the Avengers and the Fantastic Four seemingly died in battle with Onslaught, Justine donned the costume and name of the Crimson Cowl, an identity once used by Ultron, and like Ultron, she formed a new group of super villains called the Masters of Evil. Working for HYDRA, they hoped to win the favor of the New York City crime families. All of this enraged the members of the new superhero team the Thunderbolts because they were actually another faction of the Masters of Evil led by Baron Helmut Zemo/Citizen V. Helmut Zemo's father Heinrich was the original founder of the Masters of Evil and Helmut himself had once led the Masters in their siege on Avengers' mansion. As such the legacy of the Masters was important to Helmut and it angered him to see them now reduced to being hired mercenaries. When the Thunderbolts faced the Masters of Evil in battle she and her team escaped due to the blinding flash that accompanies the Crimson Cowl's teleportation effect. When next they fought Crimson Cowl escaped again. After the Thunderbolts had turned on Zemo and Techno, they found themselves fugitives hated by heroes and villains alike. The Crimson Cowl saw this as an opportunity to induct the remaining Bolts into her Masters of Evil. She sent Cyclone to bait the Thunderbolts into walking into an ambush. After defeating the T-bolts she made her \\"proposal:\\" join her and enjoy all the amenities that come with being in her organization or defy her and she would tell all of the Thunderbolts' enemies how to find them. The Thunderbolts were given time to think over the situation but in the end decided they would rather take down the Crimson Cowl instead. When next they fought, it looked like the Crimson Cowl had won until Hawkeye, disguised as Dreadknight, saved the team. Hawkeye offered to become the new Thunderbolts leader and one of his first actions as leader was to promise the media the capture of the Masters of Evil. The Masters began a plan to use a weather machine to blackmail world leaders for a billion dollars. The Masters' numbers had grown under the Cowl from 6 members to 25. Realizing they were outnumbered, Hawkeye decided to use Moonstone and her reputation as a traitor to infiltrate the Masters. Moonstone was tempted to side with the Masters for real but eventually decided against it and took the Cowl down instead. Moonstone unmasked the Crimson Cowl and the Thunderbolts were shocked to find she was Dallas Riordan, their former liaison to the office of the New York city mayor. In reality, Dallas Riordan was actually the new Citizen V. She had been knocked unconscious when she began to interfere with the Cowl's plans for the weather machine. At the last moment, Justine had teleported out of her costume and placed Dallas into it. Dallas didn't tell the Thunderbolts the truth because she was still bitter about being fired as the mayor's liaison because of the Thunderbolts deception as heroes. Eventually Dallas was rescued from jail by her team the V-Battalion. Eventually Dallas parted company with the V-Battalion after they ordered her to assassinate Henry Gyrich and she refused. Dallas came back to America to get aid from the Thunderbolts. During a battle between the V-Battalion and the Thunderbolts, the Crimson Cowl had Dallas teleported to her hideout, which was on the border of Symkaria and Latveria. Dallas was briefly held prisoner but soon escaped. She and Justine fought a long battle that ended with Dallas falling off a bridge, which left her paralyzed. Silver Sable was apparently friends with Justine and allowed her to stay in Sable's country of Symkaria when Justine moved there after inheriting her father's fortune. Silver Sable was unaware that Justine was a super villain for quite some time. Eventually, the Crimson Cowl created a new Masters of Evil. Hawkeye, Songbird, and Plantman defeated most of them and convinced several of them that the Crimson Cowl would kill them with a bio-toxin Justine's father had surreptitiously placed in the majority of super villains he had employed over the years. Hawkeye inducted several of these Masters into the Thunderbolts. The Crimson Cowl was eventually defeated by Skein, who used her powers to deconstruct Justine's costume, leaving her naked even when she was put in her own cell by the Thunderbolts. Skein managed to stitch most of it back together for Silver Sable. During the Civil War storyline, Justine appeared as part of a crew alongside Razor Fist and Diamondhead trying to escape the superhuman prison, the Raft. She teleported to the security center, knocking out both guards and releasing all the prisoners. Razor Fist, holding Robbie Baldwin as a hostage/human shield, cut Baldwin, which released his kinetic energy, rendering most of the prisoners unconscious, maimed, or possibly dead. Justine was found knocked out cold by guards.Civil War Front Line #9 Crimson Cowl was hired by the Hood to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.New Avengers #35 Later, Justine Hammer became a recurring adversary to Tony Stark in Iron Man, beginning with the 2010 storyline \\"Stark Resilient\\", which is part of the overarching storyline \\"Heroic Age\\". Justine has since ostensibly left supervillainy to take the reins of Hammer Industries, along with her daughter Sasha Hammer, and begin promoting their own line of mechanized battlesuits to sell to both the military and private interests, Detroit Steel. While the initial presentation is considered a bust, as the investors have little interest with Tony Stark's return, Stark then announces that he is leaving the weapons industry, and his interest in using repulsor technology to give free energy to the world, making the military interested again in Detroit Steel. Justine is also seen buying surplus H.A.M.M.E.R. equipment, being sold with the fall of Norman Osborn. Hammer continues as an adversary in subsequent Iron Man storylines, including \\"Demon\\", \\"The Long Way Down\\" and \\"The Future\\". After Stark and Stane joined forces to create a revolution and escape captivity, Ezekiel and Sasha killed Justine in revenge for what the Mandarin did to Ezekiel.Invincible Iron Man #527(December, 2012) Powers and abilities The Crimson Cowl's main power is her prehensile cloak. Its many billows seem capable of elongating, strangling and grappling, and pummeling (and even forming sharp edges with its corners). The cloak also contains devices enabling her to levitate and to teleport herself and her teammates away from the scene, with a brilliant, debilitating flash of light just prior to the effect.Thunderbolts Vol.1 #3 Justine Hammer is an adept athlete and unarmed combatant. She is also a shrewd businesswoman and negotiator, making her a formidable leader and criminal organizer. Other versions Justine Hammer is introduced into the Ultimate Marvel universe in Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars #1, where she has broken into one of Tony Stark's secret laboratories in hopes of finding a cure for her \\"superhuman sickness\\" caused by her late father. She helps Tony in battling the Ultimate version of Ghost, but he disappears before they are able to defeat him. In exchange for saving her life, Justine agrees to help Tony recover his stolen \\"ornament\\" from Ghost and his employers. In the final issue, it is revealed that she was manipulating Tony on behalf of her and the Ghost's employer Howard Stark Sr. (Tony's grandfather). The \\"ornament\\" turns out to contain the head of a Tony Stark from an alternate universe whose armor destroys unidentified nanotechnology. While Tony's armor is protected, the nanomachines used to save Justine's life are affected and she dies.Ultimate Comics Armor Wars #4 In other media Crimson Cowl is featured as a boss in the Playdom's Facebook game Marvel: Avengers Alliance.

Member newspapers represented by the Alliance include large daily papers, non- daily and small-market publications, as well as digital and multiplatform products. The organization has organized and hosted mediaXchange,mediaxchange, News Media Alliance the newspaper industry's annual conference. Overview Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C., the News Media Alliance focuses on the foremost issues shaping the newspaper industry today. Among the association's top priorities are public policy and legal matters, as well as revenue and audience development for the broad range of products and digital platforms now offered by the newspaper industry. As stated on its website, the Alliance serves the newspaper industry in strategic efforts to: * Serve as a catalyst for industry growth * Identify and disseminate examples of industry innovation * Provide tools to exchange information and ideas * Advocate and communicate industry views and interests to the Federal Government and to third-party standards and measurement bodies * Communicate the vitality of newspaper media to external constituencies including the advertising community, Wall Street and the news mediaAbout Us, News Media Alliance History On June 1, 1992, seven newspaper-industry associations merged to create the Newspaper Association of America. The associations included the American Newspaper Publishers Association (founded in 1887), the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, the Association of Newspaper Classified Advertising Managers, the International Circulation Managers Association, the International Newspapers Advertising and Marketing Executives, the Newspaper Advertising Co-op Network, and the Newspaper Research Council. In 2016, the Newspaper Association of America changed its name to the News Media Alliance. After this change the Alliance no longer required that members produce a printed paper, with the organization now also accepting digital news sites as members. However, all members must still produce original journalism. In July 2017, the News Media Alliance announced they were trying to get a limited antitrust exemption from Congress, to let them negotiate collectively with internet companies.Newspapers to bid for antitrust exemption to tackle Google and Facebook - Karen Gilchrist, CNBC, July 10, 2017 In June 2019, in an apparent effort to promote this bill, now named the \\"Journalism Competition and Preservation Act\\", it published a report estimating that in 2018, Google had made around $4.7 billion from news content. The NMA's head David Chavern argued that part of that sum should be shared with the news industry. As summarized by the Columbia Journalism Review, the accuracy of the NMA's claims was widely questioned, with \\"a number of prominent journalists and media-industry observers [scoffing] at both the number and the report itself\\". The Nieman Journalism Lab criticized the NMA's report as \\"based on math reasoning that would be embarrassing from a bright middle schooler\\". Organization The Alliance previously partnered with the Newspaper National Network (now closed), a print and online advertising sales partnership, and the NAA Foundation, which emphasizes youth readership and the cultivation of a more diverse media work force. The Alliance is a member of the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers, the World Press Freedom Committee and the International Press Telecommunications Council.

It covered about 100 acres on the floodplain of the Little Tennessee River in what is now Franklin, North Carolina. Today, an associated platform mound is the only extant feature left of the town. History The town (also known as Nucassee) was founded sometime before 1544, as it appears on several maps from that time.Debunking Origins ‚Äì Ancient Nikwasi Mound; BPR.org; accessed April 2019 It is first mentioned in the records of the British colonies in America in 1718. The town was a spiritual, cultural, and ceremonial center for the local Cherokee people, who considered it the \\"Mother Town.\\"Nikwasi; Holly, Nathaniel F.; \\"Living Memorials to the Past ‚Äì The Preservation of Nikwasi and the \\"Disappearance\\" of North Carolina's Cherokees\\"; jStore; [from The North Carolina Historical Review; (¬© 2015)]; accessed April 2019 The towns people kept the ever-burning sacred fire of the settlement, which had been kept burning since the beginning of their culture, located there in the fire pit of the meeting hall. The Varnod census, enumerated in 1721, found a native population of the town to be 142‚Äîconstituting 53 men, 50 women, and 59 children. Treaty of 1727 The town's meeting hall was set upon a central platform mound still prominent in the area today. Nikwasi probably met with a delegation from Charleston, South Carolina there in 1727; Colonel John Herbert took part in a treaty council held in the meeting hall on December 3, 1727. Following the signing of the treaty with South Carolina, a self-appointed royal ambassador, Alexander Cuming, was hosted at the town from April 3 to 4, 1730. During the negotiations with the Cherokee, Cuming met with Uku (or \\"First Beloved Man\\") Moytoy (known also as Ama-edohi).A Cherokee Encyclopedia.; Conley, Robert J.; Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press; (2007); ; pp.16, 166‚Äì169. Cuming \\"appointed\\" Moytoy as \\"Emperor\\" of the Cherokee and secured a dubious pledge of allegiance of all the Cherokee peoples to King George II from him.Nikwasi; North Carolina Markers, ncmarkers.com; accessed April 2019 The treaty was generally honored until 1741. Further dealings with colonials During the summer of 1761 the Nikwasi townhouse was used as a field hospital by the members of a punitive expedition against native American allies of France during the French-Indian War. The party, which had razed most of the town in the expedition, was led by James Grant. The town was once again leveled September 10, 1776 during the Rutherford Light Horse expedition, when the towns people allied with Great Britain early in the American War for Independence.The Rutherford Trace and the Destruction of Nikwasi; North Carolina DCR government website; accessed April 2019 Rutherford burned the town and its farmlands to the ground. After an austere, harsh winter, the town sued for peace the following Spring. The Nikwasi Mound as photographed in June, 1963. The ascension ramp is at the left side of the photo. The town was emptied in 1819 of its native American inhabitants when the townspeople were forced from their lands into the Qualla Boundary by the government. The mound The platform mound is conspicuous to the many drivers who pass by daily on US 441 Business in downtown Franklin. The mound architecture has been well-preserved down to the present day, and the ramp and flat summit continue to be easily differentiated. The 2009 GPR survey revealed that the base of the mound is covered by one to two meters of combined alluvial deposits and manmade fill. As a result of these findings, it is clear that prior to the flooding and fill events the mound enjoyed greater topographic prominence than currently, and was once a more impressive part of the cultural landscape than it is today. The mound appears to date to Mississippian culture with construction estimated at about the year AD 1000. The mound has been owned by the town of Franklin since the 1940s. There is, however, an ongoing initiative to release at least a share of the land title to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI) through the \\"Nikawasi Initiative,\\" a not for profit organization.Nikwasi Initiative Wants Deed to Cherokee Mound; article 06 March 2019; Written by Stone, Jessi; \\"Smokey Mountain News online;\\" accessed April 2019 The mound would then become part of the \\"Nikwasi-Cowee Corridor,\\" an EBCI proposal covering the Nikwasi mound and the nearby Cowee Mound (a similarly built mound across the river ‚Äì just north of Franklin). Archaeological and geophysical investigations The mound site takes its name from the Cherokee town which had located on about 100 acres there and entered the historical record in the early 18th century. Based on the southeast orientation of the ramp and the results of a 2009 ground- penetrating radar survey, the summit of the mound is thought to have been the seat of the townhouse in which Cherokee leaders hosted British and American delegations through the years.Note: A southeast-oriented doorway is the norm for excavated Cherokee townhousesOn the 2009 GPR survey, see A single 5‚Ä≤ x 5‚Ä≤ test shaft dug by University of North Carolina archaeologists in 1963 constitutes the entirety of formal digging known to have been undertaken at Nikwasi. The mound's excellent state of preservation owes much to the fact that it was never opened by the Smithsonian during the later part of the 19th century. Since 1980, the mound has been on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Preservation efforts In 2012, the Eastern Band of the Cherokee regarded the town of Franklin spraying herbicide as \\"desecration\\" and principal chief Michell Hicks wanted the site turned over to the Eastern Band, which the town refused to do. The conflict led in 2016 to the formation of Nikwasi Initiative. In 2017 the Eastern Band bought a building next to the mound, later studying whether to use it as a museum. In May 2019, the town of Franklin transferred the mound to the Nikwasi Initiative. The Tribal Council of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee voted in July 2019 to provide $300,000 to the Nikwasi Initiative.

The three New York city recipes from 1953 use few ingredients besides salt, pepper, and butter: brandy, sherry, chives (Sherry-Netherland); chives, dry mustard, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce (Drake); chives, parsley, Worcestershire sauce (Colony). Only the Sherry-Netherland recipe explicitly calls for flamb√©ing. Other recipes may use chives, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, thinly sliced mushrooms, shallots, cream, truffles, meat stock, or commercial steak sauce. The sauce is flamb√©ed with brandy, dry sherry, or Madeira, and poured over the steak.

Typically, a component is exposed to a chemical vapor causing the surface to flow thereby improving the surface finish. This method of polishing is frequently used to return clear materials to an optical quality finish after machining. Vapor polishing works well in the internal features of components. Feature size changes of the plastic component generally do not occur. Post stress relieving is usually required as vapor polishing sets up surface stresses that can cause crazing. Plastics that respond well to vapor polishing are polycarbonate, acrylic, polysulfone, PEI, and ABS. The technique is also being used to improve the surface of objects created with 3D printing techniques. As the printer deposits layer upon layer of material to build the object, the surface is often not entirely smooth. The smoothness of the surface can be greatly increased by vapor polishing.

He also appeared in three National Lacrosse League All-Star Games, two with the Rock, and one with the Wings. In 2003, Clark played for Team Canada as they won the World Indoor Lacrosse Championships. In 2011, he became goaltending coach for Team Canada. Glenn played for the Eastenders ball hockey team out of Toronto, Ontario from 2013-2016 Off the floor, Clark was a former physical education teacher at Bayview Secondary School in Richmond Hill, Ontario before his retirement in 2019. Biography Clark first played lacrosse for Ajax at the age of nine. He played five years of Junior lacrosse, three and one half years for Scarborough and one and one half years for Whitby. Clark was called up in 1990 to help Brooklin win the Mann Cup, and was drafted by the Redmen in 1991, scoring 55 goals and 126 assists plus 467 PIM in 190 games, including a brief stint for Brantford in the \\"old\\" NLL in 1991. Glenn was the Defensive Player of the Year for Brooklin all five of the summers in which he played the full schedule. NLL career Clark was drafted by the Ontario Raiders, and played in 1998, the Raiders' only season. The next year, the Raiders moved to Toronto, becoming the Toronto Rock. Clark played seven seasons with the Rock, helping lead them to five NLL championships (1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2005). Clark appeared in two All-Star Games as a member of the Rock, in 2004 and 2005. After the 2005 season, Clark signed as a free agent with the Philadelphia Wings. He played the 2006 season as a member of the Wings and was selected to the All-Star team for a third time. After the 2006 season, Clark was offered the position of head coach of the Toronto Rock, and immediately retired from playing to take the job. His debut season with the Rock was not as successful as Clark was hoping for; the Rock opened the season with three straight losses before climbing to a final 6-10 record. This was good enough to make the playoffs, but the Rock were beaten 10-6 by the eventual Champion's Cup-winning Rochester Knighthawks. On January 11, 2008, the Minnesota Swarm defeated the Toronto Rock 17-16 in overtime. After the game, Clark was involved in an altercation with Minnesota forward Sean Pollock outside the Rock dressing room. Clark was later charged with assault by Toronto Police. On January 17, the NLL announced that Clark was suspended indefinitely. The charges against Clark were eventually dropped, and the suspension was lifted on February 13. The Rock won their 2009 season opener against the New York Titans, but after they lost their next two games, scoring a total of only 15 goals, Clark was fired on January 20, 2009 along with assistant coach Terry Bullen. Assistant coach Jim Veltman was retained by the Rock in an advisory position. Clark was replaced with Jamie Batley.

The Depot had its origin in 1940 when the Navy bought of wetlands from the city of Oakland for $1.00. The Navy reclaimed the land and populated it with large warehouses. It opened on December 15, 1941, and quickly began a decades-long expansion.

Chapin is best known today as the subject of the Augustus Saint-Gaudens sculpture entitled Deacon Samuel Chapin (also known as The Puritan).  Life  Chapin was born in Paignton (near Torquay), Devon, England, to John Chapin and Phillipe Easton. His baptism is recorded as October 8, 1598.Chapin, Gilbert Warren, Vol. I, p. x-xi. On February 9, 1623/4,Julian vs. Gregorian calendar. See Old Style and New Style dates. Samuel married Cicely Penny. They had seven children: David, Catherine, Sarah, Josiah, Henry, Japhet and Hannah. The oldest five children were born in England and the last two in Massachusetts, Japhet in Roxbury and Hannah in Springfield.Chapin, Gilbert Warren, Vol. I, p. xi. He immigrated to America either with or shortly after William Pynchon, between 1630 and 1635, and became a full member of John Eliot's congregation at Roxbury (later incorporated into the city of Boston). The Chapins lived in Roxbury till the close of the year 1642, as on 15 of October of that year Japhet was baptized there. Soon after this, however, they must have moved to Springfield, for we find them there in January 1642/3.Chapin, Howard Millar, p. 14 On 26 September 1644, Samuel Chapin was chosen for a committee of five to order the prudential affairs of the town. This prudential committee was in reality the first board of Selectmen in Springfield. The Selectmen, or Townsmen as they were sometimes called, were generally five in number. They were elected by a vote of all the freemen of the town at the town meeting, and were to serve for one year. They settled disputes, heard complaints, admitted inhabitants, regulated highways, bridges, fences, finances, etc., and had a general supervision over all the affairs of the town.Chapin, Howard Millar, p. 18 Samuel Chapin held the office of Selectman continuously from 26 September 1644, to 22 November 1652, when having taken the oath of a Commissioner, he could no longer serve as Selectman.Chapin, Howard Millar, p. 18, 22 After the Massachusetts General Court's displeasure with William Pynchon's heresy, Pynchon had to resign as the magistrate of Springfield in 1651. The office was taken up by his son-in- law, Henry Smith but in the summer of 1652 Pynchon and Smith left for England. In October 1652,Orange Chapin gives the date as the 10th (p. 2) but Howard Millar Chapin gives a date of the 19th (p. 22) so the date is not 100% certain. Chapin, Pynchon's son John and another Pynchon son-in-law, Elizur Holyoke, were appointed town Commissioners (essentially a board of magistrates). They had full power and authority to govern the inhabitants of Springfield; to hear and determine all cases and offenses, both civil and criminal, and to inflict all punishments not reaching life, limb, or banishment; to give oaths to constables; and to examine witnesses on oath.Chapin, Howard Millar, p. 22 He apparently held office as a commissioner until 1660/1.Chapin, Howard Millar, p. 23 Chapin then alternated between being a selectman (1660 and 1663) and a commissioner (1662, 1664 and 1665).Chapin, Howard Millar, pp. 30-33 Chapin was actively interested in the church and appears to have been a deacon as early as 1650. Chapin died in Springfield in November 1675 shortly after the town was devastated in King Philip's War. In October 1675 Chief Metacomet (known as \\"King Philip\\") visited the Agawam Indians (of the Pocomtuc tribe) residing within the town and incited them to mount an attack on Springfield. Despite the inhabitants being warned of the attack many of the houses and barns were burned to the ground, as were its saw and grist mills. Cicely survived him by just over seven years, dying in February 1682.Gilbert Warren Chapin and Howard Millar Chapin both give the date of death recorded as 8 Feb 1682, but because the Julian calendar was still in use, she died in what would in current terms be dated 1683. Some accounts will note her death as 1682/3 for this reason. See Old Style and New Style dates for full explanation. All their children grew to adulthood, married, and produced a total of 72 grandchildren, most of whom grew up and married.Chapin, Gilbert Warren, Vol. I.  Commemoration  In 1881, Chester W. Chapin, a railroad tycoon, congressman and Chapin descendant, commissioned master sculptor Augustus St. Gaudens to produce a work memorializing his ancestor.Dryfhout, p. 162. The sculpture, most commonly known as The Puritan, is currently sited in Springfield's Merrick Park. It emphasizes the piety, and perhaps moral rigidity, of the country's religious founders‚Äîevident in the sculpted Chapin's proud pose, certain stride, flowing cape and hefty Bible, as well as his assertive use of a walking cane. Smaller variants of the same work can be found in several museums.

The name has a Maori meaning, from Te Aka Maori/English Dictionary, as \\"to take/carry joy\\" or, as local legend suggests, \\"come together in unison\\" from a Maori canoe paddling chant/song. In recent years, Hari Hari has been increasingly referred to as \\"Harihari\\" with Maori meaning as \\"ambulance\\". No official statutory process has taken place in order for this to happen. It is slightly inland from the Tasman Sea and the Saltwater Lagoon and is situated between the Wanganui and Poerua Rivers, 45 minutes south of the tourist town of Hokitika. passes through the town on its route from Ross to the Franz Josef Glacier. The Westland District's largest town, Greymouth is , and Hokitika to the north-east. Ross is to the north- east, and Franz Josef is 32 km south west. The population of Hari Hari and its surrounds was 330 in the 2013 census, a reduction of 21 since 2006. Hari Hari was once a logging settlement and relics of a bush tramway that used to carry timber can be found in the area. Today, the forest in the area is protected and popular activities in the Hari Hari area include bushwalking, birdwatching, and trout and salmon fishing. The Inter-Wanganui Co-op opened a dairy factory at Hari Hari in 1908, but it is now a ruin. Hari Hari's main claim to fame occurred on 7 January 1931, when Australian aviator Guy Menzies landed upside down in a swamp near Hari Hari, completing the first solo flight across the Tasman Sea. Menzies, who had left Sydney 11 hours and 45 minutes earlier, was aiming for Blenheim but had been blown off course and mistook a swamp for flat pasture suitable for landing. Despite the accident, he was unharmed. On 7 January 2006, the 75th anniversary celebrations of the feat were held in Hari Hari, with roughly 400 people in attendance. To mark the occasion, Dick Smith recreated Guy Menzies' flight, though Smith chose to land upright in Hari Hari. Local name change controversy Many local residents are upset about the growing number of official websites, and official documentation, referring to Hari Hari as being \\"Harihari\\". The greater community insists that they were not informed or talked to about this matter, and are against the gradual unofficial change. Some are being active about keeping their town's name the same, and have involved the Department of MƒÅori Affairs about the tampering with of a traditional MƒÅori place name. Town signs around Hari Hari still state the name is Hari Hari. One newly placed town distance sign in Whataroa shows the name \\"Harihari\\". The town was named in 1908 when a post office was needed for the township. \\"Hari Hari Post Office\\" was operated by Postmaster Hende. Prior to this, Hari Hari was called \\"Hende's Ferry\\" after the Hende family, the first European settlers in the area. Land Information New Zealand states, they have no record of \\"Hari Hari Post Office\\" and insist the \\"accepted\\" name is Harihari. They also state that a chain of surveyors who had surveyed the area over past years had used the shortened name. Locals say this is debatable and untrue. If true, this was either from a lack of knowledge of Hari Hari's given name, or the surveyors were simply saving time by shortening the town's name. This has resulted in confusion, and official Government Organizations and Internet sites World Wide, such as Google Earth not using the real town name. Gerald Arthur of Land Information New Zealand and New Zealand Geographic Board (Nga Pou Taunaha o Aotearoa) has stated that, \\"The accepted form of the town name is Harihari as one composite word\\", although, he also states \\"The name [Harihari] has not been through the New Zealand Geographic Board's statutory process\\".

After 23 years under that name, they became Jefferson Hart & The Ghosts of the Old North State in January 2013. Career Jeff Hart and the Ruins was formed in January 1990 by Jeff Hart, along with bassist Chip Robinson and drummer John Flowers. As with musical predecessors The Byrds, Tom Petty, and The Kinks (Muswell Hillbillies era) and contemporaries like Paul Westerberg and The Jayhawks, the music of the band strays into both the \\"alt.country\\" and power pop styles of rock and roll. Don Bailey later joined the original three to round out the first era of the band. Jeff Hart: The Singles 1960-1990 Their debut CD was released in November 1990 and entitled Jeff Hart: The Singles 1960-1990 (Bombay Records ABR-001). Though Jeff Hart and the Ruins played live in support of the CD, the recordings were essentially a solo anthology of studio material that Hart wrote and sang from his previous bands. This consisted of selections from the North Carolina alt.country pioneers The Hanks, The Ragdads and some acoustic sessions at Duck Kee Studio with Jerry Kee, Ron Bartholomew, Chip Robinson, Danny Moses and Steve Howell. Glances From a Nervous Groom Following the departure of Robinson, Bailey and Flowers in 1991, numerous members (notably Dave Bartholomew of Tres Chicas and Danny Kurtz of Whiskeytown and The Backsliders) and bassist Thomas Wilson filled their roles in the short term. Beginning in 1994, a core lineup of Brian Yamamoto on guitar and vocals, Glenn Jones on bass and vocals and Bryan Sodemann on drums and vocals held steady until 1996. The next CD, Glances From a Nervous Groom (Bombay Records ABR-002), was released in December 1995 and recorded with this new lineup. It was the first (and to date only) CD credited to Jeff Hart and the Ruins. Eric Midkiff replaced Glenn Jones in the band in 1996 and played guitar while Hart moved to bass. After Midkiff's departure in 1996, Steve Hisada replaced him on guitar and occasional bass while Hart split bass and guitar duties with Hisada. Jeff Hart and the Ruins disbanded in July 1998. Reunion After a five-year hiatus, Midkiff rejoined the band for their reunion in April 2003 with Symen Blumenfeld on bass along with previous members Hart, Yamamoto and Sodemann. Midkiff took time off again in 2008. Original drummer John Flowers rejoined briefly in 2010 and upon his departure, he was replaced by Jim McPhail. McPhail departed in July 2012 and Flowers re-joined. The Ruins also appear on 7 of the 14 songs (Goodbye Anne Shore Goodbye, All Along the Wallflower, View Ye Living, Love in Return, Better Days, Margarite and Walking Between Raindrops)on Hart's December 2011 CD release \\"Ghosts of the Old North State\\". The Hart, Yamamoto, Blumenfeld and Flowers was intact until Flowers departed in early 2016 (replaced by Randy Benefield) and the death of Blumenfeld in April 2019 (replaced by Hart's daughter Ella that summer). https://www.facebook.com/pg/GhostsoftheOldNorthState/about/ \\"You and Your Kind\\", a song Hart wrote while with The Hanks, but played for the better part of a decade with The Ruins, was featured in the \\"Betty and Veronica\\" episode in the first season of the WB Network show Veronica Mars. The recording used was from a 2003 live CD by The Brown Mountain Lights, Late Show at the Cave (ABR-003). Jeff Hart's songs \\"Love In Return\\" and \\"So Old\\" have also been covered live by Chris Stamey and Chip Robinson in the Vibekillers respectively. Jefferson Hart & The Ghosts of the Old North State The band renamed itself after 23 years as Jeff Hart and the Ruins to Jefferson Hart and The Ghosts of the Old North State (after the album of the same name) in February 2013. Jeff has also been playing solo under the name Jefferson Hart since early in 2013.https://www.facebook.com/GhostsoftheOldNorthState?fref=ts Drummer Randy Benefield replaced John Flowers who left in early 2016.

Plot summary There are two interconnected plots that unfold simultaneously in this novel; one is set in the present, and deals with Bob Lee Swagger and Russ Pewtie, while the other is set in 1955, and deals with Bob Lee's father, Earl, and the events leading up to his death. This book catches the reader up with Bob Lee about five years after the events in Point of Impact. He now has a daughter who is four years old, named Nikki, and he has married Julie Fenn, the widow of his fallen spotter, Donnie Fenn. He is living happily, if not humbly, in Arizona, trying to avoid the notoriety he gained during the events in Point of Impact. A young man approaches him with a proposition. This young man's name is Russ Pewtie, the grown son of Bud Pewtie, who as described in Dirty White Boys was responsible for the death of Lamar Pye. Russ is a writer, and wants to write a book about Bob Lee's father Earl, a Marine Corps veteran and State Policeman who was supposedly gunned down one night in 1955, near Bob's home town of Blue Eye, Arkansas, by Lamar's father, Jimmy who was to surrender to Earl after robbing a grocery store and killing four people. As Russ and Bob Lee probe into the details surrounding Earl's death, there are some startling revelations, including a conspiracy to keep these details hidden, which give deeper insight into the history of Bob Lee. Bob Lee uses his knowledge of firearms, sniping and military history to unravel conflicting details about the shooting of his father and find out the real reason his father was killed as well as finding out the identity of the real shooter. The plot involves several of Hunter's signature interconnecting characters (who appear in various roles in more than one of his novels). These include Sam Vincent, the former Polk County prosecutor who appears in Point of Impact, and Frenchy Short, the CIA agent and Earl Swagger prot√©g√© who appears in The Second Saladin, and also in the later Earl Swagger novels Hot Springs and Havana. Part of the connection between the novel's two time periods is the role of Sam Vincent in the prosecution of the murderer of a young black girl in 1955, and the re-investigation of that case in the present. 1996 novels Thriller novels Fiction set in 1955 ","title":"Black Light (novel)"},{"id":"6403492","text":"Patriot Games is a 1987 novel by Tom Clancy.

The youngest son of Jock and Miss Ellie Ewing, he was portrayed by actor Patrick Duffy (1978‚Äì1985, 1986‚Äì1991). Bobby had been killed off in the final episode of the 1984‚Äì1985 season, and Patrick Duffy left the show for a year. Bobby returned to the show in the famous \\"shower scene\\" right at the end of the 1985‚Äì1986 season. The subsequent \\"dream revelation\\" at the start of the 1986‚Äì1987 season, wrote off Bobby's accident, his death and all but the final scene of the 1985‚Äì1986 season, as a dream of Bobby's fianc√©e and ex-wife, Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal). Patrick Duffy returned to play Bobby in the films Dallas: J.R. Returns (1996) and Dallas: War of the Ewings (1998), as well as in the new Dallas series (2012‚Äì2014). Dallas was originally planned to center on Bobby's Romeo and Juliet-style marriage to Pamela Barnes, who was from the rival Barnes family. According to Dallas scriptwriter and story editor Camille Marchetta, Bobby was initially going to be killed off by the end of season 1, leaving Pamela to become the central character of the series. Bobby's character was kept, but the show ended up focusing on his older brother, J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman), as it became clear that he was the breakout character. Still, Bobby retained his central role as the show's primary hero, and the Abel to J.R.'s Cain. Background Bobby was born February 16, 1950 (according to a shot of his passport in season 14 episode \\"Charade\\") on Southfork Ranch. Bobby became a successful (though reluctant) oil baron, like his father and brother, but he lacked J.R.'s ruthlessness and insisted on playing fair which resulted in his limited success. Bobby would also take part in the raising of cattle on the family ranch, Southfork. He was also a state senator in Austin for a while. Character Bobby's most defining character trait was his altruistic desire to do the right thing. This almost always put him in the cross-hairs of his older brother JR, who was known as a conniving and ruthless oilman. Bobby did on many occasions use ruthless tactics in failed attempts to beat J.R. Bobby was one of few people openly to take a stand against J.R. on numerous occasions (at times physically), yet the two never forgot they were brothers. In addition to the differences between their treatment of others, as well as their conflicting views on morality, another reason for J.R. and Bobby's rivalry was their father's preference for Bobby (their mother, Miss Ellie, favored second son Gary). Growing up, and even into adulthood, Jock made no secret of the fact that Bobby was his favorite son and Bobby was very dependent on Jock's support in his fights with J.R. This caused a major rivalry with J.R., who was jealous of the unearned favoritism Bobby got from Jock. (In the pilot episode, Jock states outright ‚ÄúI spoiled Bobby rotten, and he was the best thing that ever happened to me.‚Äù) Bobby was known for his short temper and emotional reactions. Storylines Dallas In the first episode of Dallas in 1978, Bobby Ewing brought his new wife to meet his family at Southfork Ranch. However, Bobby's family were dismayed to discover that Bobby's wife was Pamela Barnes (Victoria Principal, briefly Margaret Michaels), the daughter of Digger Barnes (Keenan Wynn, originally David Wayne) and the sister of Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval), both of whom were arch-enemies of the Ewing family. In 1982, Bobby and Pam adopted a boy named Christopher (Joshua Harris, originally Eric Farlow), who was the biological son of J.R.'s deceased sister-in-law, Kristin Shepard (Mary Crosby). Pam had always wanted a child but was unlikely to be able to have one of her own. Bobby's sister-in- law, Katherine Wentworth (Morgan Brittany), later had an unrequited crush on Bobby and began to become obsessed with him. Katherine broke up Bobby's marriage to Pam by writing a letter (pretending to be Pam) addressed to her lawyer. Bobby turned to childhood sweetheart Jenna Wade (Priscilla Presley; previously Morgan Fairchild and Francine Tacker) and they became engaged. Katherine ran Bobby down with her car, where he later died in hospital from his injuries. However, a year later, the storylines of the preceding season, including the accident and death of Bobby, were nothing more than a lengthy dream of Pam's. Bobby and Pam were reunited but Jenna discovered that she was pregnant with his child. Bobby wasn't interested in getting back with Jenna, and Jenna later gave birth to his son, Lucas Krebbs. When Pam was involved in a car crash which resulted in her suffering severe burns, she disappeared from the hospital and divorced Bobby and gave him sole custody of Christopher. Bobby became close to April Stevens (Sheree J. Wilson) and they began a relationship and eventually married. However, while on their honeymoon in Paris, April is kidnapped and later shot; she dies in Bobby's arms. Bobby is first on the scene after hearing a gunshot from J.R. (Larry Hagman) room uttering the words \\"Oh my God.\\" The camera never shows what Bobby actually saw and it was thought J.R. committed suicide, although in subsequent films it was explained J.R. shot a mirror. J.R. Returns and War of the Ewings In J.R. Returns, Bobby had a relationship with Julia Cunningham before taking over Ewing Oil. In the follow-up film War of the Ewings, he is no longer with Julia and the reasons are not even explained. He eventually starts a relationship with European oil heiress Jennifer Jantzen, who was a business associate of his brother J.R. and whose father's company Jantzen Oil was saved from bankruptcy by J.R. Between 1996 and 1998, Bobby is CEO of Ewing Oil. In 1998, Bobby retires from Ewing Oil and begins travelling with Jennifer Jantzen. Dallas (2012) By 2012, Bobby has remarried again, this time to a woman named Ann Smith, and is the owner of Southfork Ranch, according to the terms of Miss Ellie Ewing's will (in season 14 (ep. 353), Miss Ellie had deeded Southfork to Bobby while she was still alive, thereby suggesting a continuity error). Bobby has retired from the oil business, believing that alternative energy is \\"the future\\", a belief he shares with his now grown adopted-son Christopher, and is content to raise cattle on the ranch. He has decided to sell Southfork, due to his contracting a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and resulting fears that he will not be around to keep the ranch safe, and that Christopher is not yet ready to take over from him. Once again, this brings him into conflict with his older brother J.R. and his nephew, John Ross Ewing III (who has discovered oil on the ranch). Bobby is shocked and saddened when he finds out his brother J.R. is dead. When J.R.'s will is read Bobby receives J.R.'s entire boot collection on the condition that he keeps them cleaner than he keeps his own. Also an old letter from Miss Ellie reveals that John Ross gets half of Southfork. Bobby doesn't agree but goes along with it for now, although it later leads to some disputes between Bobby and John Ross. Bobby also learns that his first wife Pam died of cancer in 1989. Knots Landing appearances Bobby Ewing appeared in three episodes of the Dallas spin-off series, Knots Landing, between 1979 and 1982. ;Season 1 *Episode 1: \\"Pilot\\". Bobby accompanies his brother Gary and sister-in-law Valene to their new home in California. ;Season 2 *Episode 13: \\"The Loudest Word\\". Bobby visits Val in the hospital, where she is awaiting surgery. Bobby persuades Gary to support Val through her illness. ;Season 4 *Episode 6: \\"New Beginnings\\". While Gary is at Southfork for the reading of Jock's will, Bobby reassures Gary about his upcoming inheritance and the strings that their father had tied to it. Knots Landing and Bobby Ewing's death As many storylines on Knots Landing depended on the actions of several characters following the death of Bobby Ewing in 1985, the subsequent dream revelation from Dallas in 1986 did not get applied to the continuity of Knots Landing. Bobby's return was never addressed or even mentioned and, following this, no further crossover storylines were featured on Knots Landing.

The eleventh named storm and third hurricane of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season, Kyle developed as a subtropical cyclone on September 20 to the east-southeast of Bermuda. Looping westward, it transitioned into a tropical cyclone and became a hurricane on September 25. For the next two weeks, Kyle tracked generally westward, oscillating in strength several times because of fluctuations in environmental conditions. On October 11, the cyclone turned northeastward and made landfalls near Charleston, South Carolina, and Long Beach, North Carolina, at tropical storm status. After lasting as a cyclone for 22 days, Kyle dissipated on October 12 as it was absorbed by an approaching cold front. The hurricane brought light precipitation to Bermuda, but no significant damage was reported there. Moderate rainfall accompanied its two landfalls in the United States, causing localized flash flooding and road closures. Floodwaters forced the evacuation of a nursing home and several mobile homes in South Carolina. Kyle spawned at least four tornadoes, the costliest of which struck Georgetown, South Carolina; it damaged 106 buildings and destroyed seven others, causing eight injuries. Overall damage totaled about $5 million (2002 USD, $ USD), and no direct deaths were reported. However, the remnants of Kyle contributed to one indirect death in the British Isles. Meteorological history A cold front stalled and began weakening to the southeast of Bermuda on September 15, spawning a low-pressure area by September 18\\\\. A stationary wind circulation developed around the low by September 19, aided by a trough aloft to its west. Convection developed into narrow banding features far from the center, and the overall structure gradually consolidated. It is estimated that the system developed into a subtropical depression late on September 20, about 490 miles southeast of Bermuda; it was classified subtropical because of the large distance between the convection and the center, uncharacteristic of purely tropical systems. The cyclone tracked northward within the weak steering flow between an upper-level low to its south and a trough to its north. Strengthening gradually, the depression attained subtropical storm status early on September 21, and as such was named Kyle by the National Hurricane Center. After being named, Kyle tracked north-northeastward before gradually executing a clockwise loop. Initially, the circulation center remained partly exposed to the south and west of the deep convection. On September 22, the convection increased around the center as the system developed a warm thermal core, and as a result it was reclassified as a fully tropical cyclone. A building anticyclone to the northwest turned Kyle to the southwest. After the storm briefly weakened, previously moderate wind shear began decreasing, which allowed convection to deepen and the outflow over the cyclone to improve. Tracking over progressively warmer waters, Kyle began developing a banding eye feature late on September 24. Slow strengthening continued, and the storm attained hurricane status at 1200 UTC on September 25\\\\. The next day, Kyle reached peak winds of 85 mph (130 km/h) about 490 miles east-southeast of Bermuda. TRMM satellite image of Tropical Storm Kyle on October 3 After maintaining its peak intensity for about 24 hours, Kyle began weakening on September 27 as increased upper-level shear restricted outflow and distorted the convection envelope; drier air also contributed to the weakening. On September 28, after turning west-northwestward, the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status, and by the next day the center had become devoid of deep convection. A trough passing to its north and a developing ridge to its west left the storm nearly stationary for several days. The weakening rate of Kyle was temporarily halted when thunderstorms redeveloped on September 29 and again early the next day, though late on September 30 the storm weakened to tropical depression status. The circulation had become elongated from northeast to southwest. The northeastern portion became associated with the approaching frontal zone, and was briefly monitored for signs of development. However, the southwestern portion redeveloped convection and became the dominant circulation. Remaining a tropical depression for about 18 hours, Kyle re-intensified to tropical storm status on October 1, after redeveloping some thunderstorms southeast of the center. Despite unfavorable wind shear, the convection became better organized, developing into rain bands and wrapping into the mid-level circulation of the storm. Late on October 2, Kyle developed an eye feature in the center of the storm, and the winds increased to about 65 mph (105 km/h); operationally it was forecast to regain hurricane status. However, the storm encountered further wind shear, which left the center exposed from the convection by early on October 4. Convection became intermittent and separated from the circulation, and Kyle again weakened to tropical depression status on October 5. By then, the storm had begun a steady west-northwest motion, which was followed by a slow turn to the north- northeast. On October 6, a decrease in wind shear allowed the cyclone to again reach tropical storm status, about 295 miles (475 km) west-northwest of Bermuda. Around the same time, the system was located in an area of weak steering currents; a ridge was to its northeast and southwest, an upper-level low was to its east-southeast, and a broad trough was to its northwest. By October 7, it began a slow southwestward motion around a ridge to its west. The circulation became elongated as dry air limited convection, and after shear increased on October 8, Kyle weakened to tropical depression status. By early on October 9, the depression consisted of a circulation center without any of the associated deep convection that is one of the prerequisites of being a tropical cyclone. Several hurricane forecast models predicted Kyle to weaken until dissipation. After 24 hours without significant convection, thunderstorms reformed to the southeast of the center on October 10 as the depression entered an area of warmer water temperatures. Environmental conditions became more favorable, with weakening wind shear and decreasing dry air. The depression continued tracking around a ridge, turning to the west and west-northwest toward the coast of Florida. Convection increased markedly early on October 11 as it turned northward ahead of an approaching cold front, and Kyle regained tropical storm status about 35 miles (60 km) east of the border between Florida and Georgia. Tropical Storm Kyle making landfall in South Carolina on October 11 After re-attaining tropical storm status, Kyle turned more to the northeast and parallel to the coastline, making landfall near McClellanville, South Carolina as a minimal tropical storm. The storm briefly moved over open waters before again making landfall near Long Beach, North Carolina late on October 11. By early on October 12, the storm had weakened to tropical depression status. At the time of it moving ashore, there was a separate non-tropical low to the northeast of the depression, and shear had greatly increased, which made re-intensification unlikely. However, convection redeveloped baroclinically with the approaching cold front, and Kyle attained tropical storm status for the fifth time over the eastern Pamlico Sound. The restrengthening was short-lived, as the wind field expanded while the convection transitioned into that of a frontal band. After emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean, Tropical Storm Kyle merged with a cold front late on October 12. The remnants of Kyle continued eastward, executing a loop on October 14 before turning northeastward and impacting the Azores on October 17. The next day, the remnants of Kyle were absorbed by an extratropical cyclone to its northwest, which continued northeastward and moved near the British Isles on October 23. Preparations Because of uncertainties in its track, the government of Bermuda posted a tropical storm watch for the island on September 30; it was discontinued the following day. As Kyle approached the coast of Florida, a tropical storm watch was issued between Cocoa Beach, Florida and Brunswick, Georgia, and later was extended northward to Edisto Beach, South Carolina. Early on October 11, a tropical storm warning was put in place between Brunswick, Georgia and Cape Fear, North Carolina, which was later amended to include the Pamlico Sound and the coastline through Surf City, North Carolina. Prior to it making landfall, the National Weather Service office in Wilmington, North Carolina issued a flood watch for much of the coastline that was ultimately affected; in South Carolina, a flood warning was issued for the counties of Florence, Williamsburg, and Georgetown. States of emergencies were declared for ten South Carolina counties. Impact Rainfall totals in the United States from Kyle On Bermuda, the combination of the storm and a cold front to its north produced 2.19 inches (55.6 mm) of rainfall in the first two days of October, which was about half of the monthly rainfall total. While passing near the northeast coast of Florida, Kyle produced a storm surge of 1.31 feet (0.4 m) in Fernandina Beach. Winds were light, with gusts peaking at 32 mph (52 km/h) in St. Augustine, and precipitation reached 2.05 inches (52 mm) in Fernandina Beach. Along the Georgia coastline, the storm dropped moderate rainfall that peaked at 5.35 inches (136 mm) at Hunter Army Airfield. Most of the precipitation fell in a 12‚Äëhour period, which flooded roads and low-lying areas; several roads were closed, and numerous vehicles stalled in the floodwaters. Moderate rainfall from Kyle in South Carolina peaked at 6.35 inches (161 mm) in Edisto Beach, with the precipitation resulting in minor urban flooding. In and around St. Stephen, flooding reached several feet in depth in roads and buildings; there, a nursing home had to be evacuated because of flooding. High waters in Manning severely damaged 17 mobile homes, forcing about 50 people to move to shelters. Ten car accidents were reported in Florence. The tropical storm spawned an F2 tornado in Georgetown that remained on the ground for about 1.25 miles (2 km). At its peak strength, the tornado overturned five mobile homes and a car. The tornado destroyed seven homes and damaged 106 buildings, 28 severely. Eight people were injured by the tornado. Tornado damage in Georgetown, South Carolina In North Carolina, above-normal tides caused minor beach erosion. Rainfall near the coastline reached 5.6 inches (142 mm) in Greenville. Moisture from the storm led to increased rainfall further inland, peaking at 8.72 inches (221 mm) in Butner. Raleigh-Durham recorded a two-day rainfall total of 5.79 inches (147 mm), which was the highest two-day total at the station since Hurricane Floyd in 1999. Heavy rainfall caused flash flooding in Martin County, where several roads were closed. Moderate winds were reported in the state, with gusts peaking at 49 mph (79 km/h) on Bald Head Island. The storm spawned at least three tornadoes in the state, including an F2 twister near Pantego that damaged two houses and a farm. Moisture from Kyle extended into the Mid-Atlantic states and southern New York. The precipitation alleviated rainfall deficits throughout the region. Overall damage amounted to about $5 million (2002 USD, $ USD). While no deaths were reported directly from Kyle, its remnants contributed to one death in stormy seas off the British Isles. Records Lasting for a total of 22 days, Hurricane Kyle was operationally considered the third-longest-lived tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin; Kyle was behind Hurricane Ginger in the 1971 season with 27.25 days and Hurricane Inga in the 1969 season with 24.75 days. However, an update to the Atlantic hurricane best track in 2004 led to the San Ciriaco Hurricane of 1899 to be re-analyzed as the longest-lived Atlantic tropical cyclone on record, and as a result Kyle was dropped to the fourth-longest-lived. In September 2012, Hurricane Nadine surpassed Kyle as the fourth-longest-lived cyclone at 22.25 days, dropping Kyle to fifth-longest-lived. Kyle was, at the time, the only Atlantic tropical cyclone on record to attain tropical storm status on five separate occasions; 2010's Hurricane Tomas subsequently equalled this feat.

Wyllie began his first-class career with Canterbury in 1964 and played 210 matches for the province until 1979, serving as captain on over one hundred occasions. During this time, he was an integral part of such exploits for the province as the lifting of the Ranfurly Shield in 1969 from Hawke's Bay and then in 1972 from Auckland as well as captaining the province to wins over international touring sides such as England in 1973, Scotland in 1975 and Ireland in 1976. Wyllie finally became an All Black in 1970 when he was selected to tour South Africa where he played in the second and third Tests. In the next three years, he played forty matches for New Zealand, including eleven Tests, and was captain on three occasions. Although he was discarded as an All Black after 1973, Wyllie remained a prominent player for Canterbury until 1979. Coaching In 1982, Wyllie became coach of Canterbury and immediately enjoyed success when Canterbury won the Ranfurly Shield from Wellington and went on to hold the trophy for a record-equalling three years. Under his coaching, Canterbury won the National Provincial Championship (NPC) in 1983, and also recorded victories against international teams such as the British Lions in 1983 and the Wallabies in 1986. In the 1986 New Year Honours, Wyllie was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to rugby football. Wyllie became a national selector in 1986 and he and his Auckland rival John Hart had significant roles as assistant coaches to Brian Lochore when the All Blacks won the 1987 Rugby World Cup. In 1988 Wyllie succeeded Lochore as coach, much to the annoyance of many, especially in Auckland, who favoured Hart. Despite initial success as All Black coach, a decline starting in the 1991 season led to the NZRFU appointing Hart as joint coach for the 1991 World Cup. After the unsuccessful campaign, both coaches were overlooked when Laurie Mains was selected as All Black coach. In 1991 he also appeared as an All Black in the comedy film Old Scores. Wyllie went on to take various coaching roles in England, Ireland, South Africa and Argentina and from 1996-99 was in charge of the Argentina national side, taking the Pumas to the quarterfinals at the 1999 World Cup.

With U.S. assistance, Israel and Lebanon reached a withdrawal accord in May 1983, which was then recalled by Lebanon in March 1984, due to pressure from Syria. In 1985, Israel withdrew most of its troops, leaving the South Lebanon Army, an Israeli-supported Lebanese militia, to protect a security buffer zone in southern Lebanon, which Israel considered necessary to prevent attacks on its northern territory.

Known as Woodrow Wilson Parkway or the Staunton Beltway, the state highway runs from Interstate 64 (I-64) and I-81 near Jolivue west, north, and east in a clockwise loop to SR 254 east of Staunton. SR 262 is a three-quarter circumferential highway around Staunton and adjacent portions of Augusta County. The highway contains two- and four-lane freeway and controlled-access segments and interchanges with several major highways, including U.S. Route 11 (US 11), SR 252, and SR 254 south of Staunton, US 250 on the west side of the city, and I-81 east of Staunton. Route description View north along SR 262 near US 11 south of Staunton SR 262 begins at a trumpet interchange with I-64 and I-81 a short distance south of where the Interstates diverge to head toward Richmond and Winchester, respectively. The state highway heads northwest as a four-lane freeway that meets US 11 (Greenville Avenue) at a partial cloverleaf interchange at the north end of Jolivue. West of its partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 613 (Old Greenville Road), SR 262 becomes a two-lane undivided freeway on a four-lane right-of-way. The state highway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 252 (Middlebrook Avenue), after which the freeway follows the boundary between Augusta County and the independent city of Staunton. SR 262 curves north, crosses CSX's North Mountain Subdivision, and has diamond interchanges with SR 254 (Parkersburg Turnpike) and SR 720 (Morris Mill Road). SR 262 enters the city of Staunton shortly before its diamond interchange with US 250 (Churchville Avenue), where the freeway ends and the highway begins to run concurrently with US 250 Truck. The highways head east through intersections with SR 742 (Shutterlee Mill Road) and SR 613 (Spring Hill Road). US 250 Truck diverges from SR 262 at its intersection with US 11 (Commerce Road). The state highway continues southeast through a grade crossing of the Chesapeake Western Railway and expands to a four-lane divided highway just west of SR F-224, which is used to access a country club to the north. SR 262 leaves Staunton and re-enters Augusta County just west of its diamond interchange with I-81.

She is also a songwriter, best known for her classic ballad \\"Captain Jack and the Mermaid\\" (recorded by many world folk groups such as De Dannan). She is known primarily as a folk musician and folklorist specializing in historical ballads as well as a composer of stories and music in the same genre as Donovan and Fairport Convention. Her solo performances throughout the festivals, concert halls (including the Town Hall in New York City and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.) and cathedrals throughout the US, Scotland, Wales, England, Ireland and Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome have gained her a reputation as a first rate musician and vocalist. Meg has won the respect of her fellow Irish/American musicians for her sensitive and powerful renderings of traditional Celtic songs, and sea ballads, and for her beautiful guitar accompaniment of Scottish, Irish and Breton dance tunes. She has put these talents to use as a long-standing member of the Joe Burke Trio whose leader is the legendary Galway button accordionist.Winick, Steve \\"Meg Davis Biography\\", Allmusic, retrieved 2011-01-02 In addition to her regular appearances with Joe Burke, Meg also performed and appeared on stage with such diverse musicians as Bill Monroe, Alan Stivell, Doc Watson, Pete Seeger, Ewan MacColl and Peter Yarrow to name just a few. Meg Davis was winner of the Best Young North American Songwriter Award in 1978, chosen and awarded the honor by Peter Yarrow, and has 5 albums of original music and 4 albums containing traditional ballads of land and sea to her credit. In 1990 Meg collected and arranged a collection of Scottish, Irish and original songs, entitled The Claddagh Walk produced by Donald Shaw of Capercaillie and recorded in Scotland. Of her album Captain Jack and the Mermaid, Richard Harrington, writing for the Washington Post remarked that it was \\"one of the most refreshing and brave new albums I've come across in a long time\\". In July 1991 the Washington Post said of Meg's performance of \\"Such a Parcel of Rogues\\" in the National Cathedral that \\"she gave a crystal clear reading in a sparkling vibrato that illuminated the whole of that sacred place\\". Some of her compositions have been used in film and documentaries, several songs are in use as theme songs for television shows in the Netherlands, there have been choral renditions created by choir masters in the US and UK for children's choirs. In 1993 Meg Davis was forced to stop touring and performing before live audiences due to multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia and arthritis. She continues to compose musical works and strives to return to the studio in the future to provide us all with more enchanting songs and to share her unique voice which, according to one 9 year old fan, sounds like \\"the chiming of bells\\". Although many a music critic has felt that Meg must be a classically trained composer, singer and guitarist she is self-taught, learning to play the guitar at the age of 12. She began songwriting at the age of 14 and taught herself to sing listening to old recordings of Mario Lanza and Frank Sinatra on her grandmother's record player. Meg's primary musical instruments are acoustic and electric guitars : 1960s-vintage Martin guitars 6 and 12 string, 1984 Taylor guitars made by Robert Taylor and a 1995 Fender Telecaster. Her greatest musical influences have been Donovan, Joni Mitchell, the Beatles, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Benny Goodman and Jethro Tull.

In narrative sequence it is preceded by Point of Impact and Black Light. Plot summary The book begins about four or five years after the events in Black Light. Swagger's daughter is now around 8, and he owns a \\"lay-up\\" horse ranch, where he cares for horses. He has been slipping into a deep depression due to his inability to properly support his family. Alienating himself from his wife and child, they leave for a morning horseback ride with a friend from another ranch. His wife is shot and nearly killed by a sniper, and the friend is killed. Bob assumes that the man was mistaken for him, and killed in an attempt to kill Bob Lee. This act plunges him back into a world of violence and intrigue. While his wife recuperates, he attempts to unravel the secrets behind the assault. This book has a dual plot, with the present plot, dealing with Bob's investigation into his wife's attempted murder. The second plot is set in the past, beginning on a Marine Corps base in the late 1960s or early 1970s. A young Donny Fenn is the squad leader of a group of Marines who perform the state funeral services for Marines killed in the Vietnam War, which is raging across the world. Donny is brought before his superiors and ordered to follow one of his men, who is suspected of sympathizing with peace demonstrators who are led by a charismatic man named Trig Carter. In turn, Trig is suspected of having ties to an extremist group. Incidentally, Donny's girlfriend, Julie, is involved with this group of war protestors. Donny discovers that his sympathies lie closer to Trig's friends, and rather than rat out his own man, Donny defies naval investigators, buying a one-way ticket to the front lines of the Vietnam war. Just before being shipped out, his commanding officer who admired Donny's courage, gives him enough money to run off with Julie and marry. Donny meets up with Bob Lee Swagger, a Marine Sniper at the top of his game, joining him as Bob Lee's new spotter. Scourge of the North Vietnamese army, there is already a sizeable bounty on Bob Lee's head, but after an exciting firefight to rescue an overwhelmed outpost, a vengeful NVA Colonel calls out the big gun: Solaratov, a Russian sniper who is the only man alive who could possibly equal Bob Lee Swagger. Donny is getting extremely short (close to going home). On Donny's last day in Vietnam, a day he should spend completing paperwork that will send him home, he makes the fateful decision to go on one last reconnaissance with Bob Lee. Solaratov's bullet ends both Bob Lee's career in the Marine Corps and Donny Fenn's life. Back in the present, Bob Lee is unravelling the tapestry of lies that have buried the past all these years and discovers that there may be more to Donny's death than he originally thought. 1998 novels Thriller novels Sequel novels Popular culture about the United States Marine Corps ","title":"Time to Hunt"},{"id":"6403987","text":"Kevin Curtis (born July 28, 1980) is an American football coach and former safety.

She was one of a handful of United States Navy AKAs that were manned by Coast Guard officers and crew during World War II. She served as a commissioned ship for 2 years and 5 months. Cepheus (AKA-18) was launched 23 October 1943 by Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., Kearny, N.J., under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Miss J. Sharpe; transferred to the Navy 15 December 1943; and commissioned the next day, Captain R. B. Hall, USCG, in command. Service history Mediterranean, 1944 Cepheus put to sea from Staten Island 27 February 1944, bound in convoy for Liverpool. Although several submarine contacts were reported in the convoy, effective work by the escorts prevented any attacks, and the convoy arrived safely 9 March, with its cargo destined for the Normandy invasion. Joining her assigned division in Scottish waters, Cepheus sailed for Oran, where she arrived 6 April to report to the Eighth Amphibious Force. After training exercises along the Algerian coast, she loaded vehicles and troops for the passage to Naples, where she unloaded 19 June to 23 June. After training at Palermo and Salerno, she returned to Naples to offload combat vehicles, then cleared for Castellammare near Palermo to combat load for the invasion of Southern France. Cepheus put to sea with the Camel Beach Attack Group 13 August 1944, and after a safe passage along a route designed to camouflage the convoy's destination, arrived off the beaches east of Saint Raphael just before dawn of 15 August. Her swift and competent unloading was a significant contribution to the successful passage over those beaches, and although the latter stages of unloading were accomplished under enemy air attack and through defensive smoke screen, Cepheus was empty before midnight, and moved out to await orders for her return to Naples, where she arrived on 18 August. Between 23 August and 7 October 1944, Cepheus supported the rapid advance of forces ashore by four more voyages, two from Naples to the assault area, and two from Oran to Marseilles, captured at the end of August after heavy naval bombardment of its defenses. Clearing Oran in convoy 25 October, she arrived at Norfolk, Va., 8 November. Here she prepared for duty in the Pacific, and on 18 December was underway for Pearl Harbor with cargo. Pacific, 1945-1946 LCVPs from Cepheus bringing troops ashore during an exee in Algeria, April 1944 Arriving 10 January 1945, she joined in training exercises until 26 February, when she put to sea combat loaded for the Okinawa assault. Cepheus arrived in the transport area off Okinawa on 1 April 1945, and since her cargo was destined for use after the initial assault, sent her boats for use in unloading three other transports. She retired seaward for the night, and came under enemy air attack while returning to the island next morning. During that raid, she fired upon seven Japanese aircraft, and aided in downing three. She remained off the island, unloading and aiding other ships to unload, firing on enemy aircraft, until 16 April, when she cleared for replenishment at Saipan. Through May and June, she made a voyage from the Marianas to New Zealand to load cargo, and on 12 July, returned to Ulithi to join an Okinawa-bound convoy. At Hagushi anchorage, she underwent several air attacks, then moved to Kerama Retto to unload. She returned to New Caledonia and the New Hebrides to load construction equipment, which she carried to the Philippines, arriving at Lingayen 16 September. Four days later, she put to sea for the first of two voyages from the Philippines to Japan with occupation supplies, and on 28 October, she cleared for Portland, Oregon, from Hiro Wan. One more voyage was made from the west coast to the Far East, during which Cepheus carried cargo to Tientsin, China, before 15 February 1946, when the cargo transport left San Francisco astern, bound for New York City. Here she was decommissioned 22 May 1946, and returned to the Maritime Commission.

Description The organization was founded in 1991 as a not-for-profit organization. According to the organization's website, its stated mission is \\"to encourage and promote the creation, production, distribution and consumption of wholesome family entertainment\\". Although its programs are diversified, it is perhaps best known for reviewing movies for suitability for family viewing, and endorsing acceptable ones with the Dove \\"Family-Approved\\" Seal. The organization has also commissioned independent studies completed by the Seidman College of Business at Grand Valley State University to analyze the comparative profitability and return on investment of MPAA-rated films in 1999 and 2005. Those studies have reinforced its efforts to advocate for the production of more values based films and have been relied upon by some in the industry seeking support for their projects. Additionally, Dove has sponsored its Family Film Festival in partnership with local theaters featuring films with its Family-Approved Seal and pioneered a pilot project, \\"The Dove Movie Channel,\\" to bring free movies to hospitalized children. The website states that Dove's fund-raising strategy of not soliciting contributions from the film industry for its operations eliminates commercial pressure as a factor in its reviews. However, The Dove Foundation has partnered with commercial enterprises. In one instance, its former association with Feature Films for Families, an on-line retailer of home entertainment, led to questions regarding the nature of the partnership. Movie rating system Dove uses an eight-factor content system (using a scale of 0 to 5), from which it derives a movie's overall rating. The first two factors (\\"Faith\\" and \\"Integrity\\") are considered \\"positive\\" ratings, where a higher number denotes a movie with positive character traits (for \\"Faith\\" a rating of 4 or 5 is reserved for movies with overt Christian themes) while a lower number denotes a movie with negative traits. The remaining six factors (\\"Sexuality\\", \\"Language\\", \\"Violence\\", \\"Drugs\\", \\"Nudity\\", and \\"Other\\", the last category for such objectionable content as \\"Disrespect for authority, lying, cheating, stealing, illegal activity, frightening scenes, demonic or similar references\\") are \\"negative\\" ratings, where a lower number denotes a movie with few or no objectionable items and a higher number denotes a movie with significant objectionable items. From the eight factors a movie, if recommended by Dove, can be rated as \\"All Ages\\" (no negative factors over 1), \\"12+\\" (some negative factors over 2), or \\"18+\\" (some negative factors over 2 but with a Faith rating of 4 or 5). \\"Opinion poll\\" campaign From 2005‚Äì2007, the organization partnered with Feature Films for Families to conduct a telephone opinion poll regarding movie content. Dove says that over 4.5 million participated in the survey. 300 complaints were lodged with the Missouri Attorney General's No Call unit as a result. Dove and their partner were accused by the state of Missouri of violating its \\"Do Not Call Implementation Act\\" by using the opinion poll as a means of circumventing the Act to allow Feature Films For Families to market its products. The state of Missouri imposed a restraining order on these activities in Missouri in March 2006. As a result of the Missouri Attorney General's lawsuit, Feature Films for Families Inc. of Murray, Utah, and the Dove Foundation reached a settlement agreement in the amount of US$70,000 in August 2006 for the alleged violation of state \\"No Call\\" laws.  Dove Channel  In September 2015, Cinedigm partnered with The Dove Foundation to launch Dove Channel, an online streaming service geared towards kids and faith-based viewers.

Feast or Famine was released in 2005 again to positive critical reception, as well as his side project, The Torture Papers, being part of the rap/hip-hop supergroup Army of the Pharaohs in 2006.Cordor, Cyril \\"Reef the Lost Cauze Biography\\", Allmusic, retrieved 2011-06-15 Reef is also part of hip hop underground groups; JuJu Mob & Army of the Pharaohs. Career Beginnings (1998-2000) Born Sharif Lacey in West Philadelphia, Reef the Lost Cauze came up in hip-hop as a lethal battle-rap MC. Having spent a great deal of his childhood acting in plays and performing, Reef fell in love with Hip Hop at the age of eight and has been rhyming ever since. By the time he reached high school, he had earned a reputation as a deadly battle emcee, jumping in any and every cipher he came across. It was not until he was accepted into Philadelphias University of the Arts on a film scholarship that he began to visualize a serious career on the mic. He began to hone his songwriting skills, and worked on perfecting his stage shows. He defeated opponents in all types of venues, from school grounds to grimy back alleys to professional competitions. In 2000, despite obtaining a scholarship, Reef dropped out of college where he was studying film school only at the age 19 to focus on his music realizing that he had found his true calling as a hip-hop artist.Reef the Lost Cauze on iTunes (Biography)  The High Life and Invisible Empire (2001-2004) He linked up with Philadelphia producer Sleep E early in 2002 to begin recording his first solo project, The High Life which was released in 2002. The 10-track album opened doors for Reef, and he began performing at area clubs, generating praise from fans and media alike. In February 2003, Reef released his second studio album Invisible Empire, an 18-track album that he distributed himself by way of a national schedule of shows. He won the Mic Check Battle in Philadelphia in 2003, after which he travelled to Oakland, California to take 2nd place in the Blaze Freestyle Battle. Titles and accolades aside, Reef describes the first year of his recording career as a time of growth, both professionally and personally. Life experience really came about in my writing, he says. I was comfortable with reaching beyond being simply an emcee and becoming a musician. Reef went on to say; I really wanted to take chances and play around with rhythm and flow, I lost all fear. The High Life was very basic as far song concepts, whereas with Invisible Empire I was very aware of the importance of dope, full beats. The second album brought out my thoughts and observations, and it erased a lot of things I had pent up inside. Invisible Empire put his name on the map for Philadelphia's underground rap scene. Nonetheless, it was the regional and national battle-rap competitions that gave his career a real boost. He finally landed an album deal jointly with Eastern Conference and Good Hands, the former owned by New York underground MC/DJ pair the High & Mighty. Early in 2004, Reef continued to freestyle, with a rousing performance at the Beat Society production competition in New York, and a win in the Riddle Records/Music & Strength Mic Control 3 battle taking home $10,000 in cash. He was also the End Of The Weak Challenge Champion at the Rock Steady Crew 27th Anniversary in July 2004, and went on to take the EOW Grand Championship title in 2005. Feast or Famine, JuJu Mob & Army of the Pharaohs (2005-2007) Reef announced that he was working on a new project and that he has put \\"a lot of life and business experiences into it\\". This project was soon found out to be his third studio album Feast Or Famine, and his range of expression will allow fans the opportunity to truly identify with him. This album is me at the top of my game, says Reef. I know who I am as a person, but more importantly as an artist - I feel like a pro this time around. The beats are more sonic, and although the mood is a little darker than my first two projects, the songs have a universal appeal that everyone will be able to relate to. The less well-rounded effort Feast or Famine arrived in 2005, boasting the DJ Mighty Mi-produced \\"Fair One,\\" which also featured Boot Camp Clik's top MC Sean Price, as the lead 12\\" single. In the years that followed his third album, a few local mixtapes were released, but the Philadelphia MC had success in doing several collaborations and features. He was invited into the Philadelphia crew JuJu Mob, who released their 2005 album Black Candles on Eastern Conference, as well as the underground super-collective Army of the Pharaohs, led by Jedi Mind Tricks frontman Vinnie Paz, in 2006. He was featured on both albums The Torture Papers and Ritual of Battle.http://www.allmusic.com/artist/reef-the- lost-cauze-mn0000680289/biography Accessed: February, 2014  A Vicious Cycle, The Stress Files & The Unholy Terror (2008-2010) In 2008, Reef released his fifth album, which contained production completely from Stress the White Boy; The Stress Files.

After studying reeds with Joe Allard in New York City, he attended Moravian College in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Soon, however, he joined the army in 1942, where he served in the US Army Air Corps band during World War II. After leaving the Army in 1946, Levine toured and recorded with Billy Butterfield's first big band. He appears on all of that band's Capitol recordings from 1946-1948. He also toured and recorded with Fred Waring's Pennsylvanians (for four seasons) and with Hugo Winterhalter. He married his wife Miriam in 1951. After this, Levine entered the retail clothing business and was active for 18 years in Washington, New Jersey. During this period, he had his own musical group and began an association with Parke Frankenfield which continued many years. Levine recorded four albums with Parke. In the 70's, Levine toured with the Tommy Dorsey band under Sam Donahue and later Warren Covington, for whom he was the featured soloist. Other credits include Jimmy Dorsey, Sammy Kaye, Vaughn Monroe, Art Mooney, Skitch Henderson, and Chris Griffin. He appeared at inaugural balls for Presidents Nixon, Carter, and Reagan as well as at many jazz cruises, festivals, and concerts. He started his association with Bob Crosby as a sideman in 1981. Later, he became Crosby's contractor, putting together bands for him which toured Hawaii, Brazil, and throughout the US mainland. Ten years ago, Levine formed a big band in Easton, Pennsylvania known as the Bob Crosby Orchestra, for which he served as Musical Director. Levine died on September 7, 1997, from complications due to an infection he received after going in for a routine bypass surgery.

As of the 2018-2019 West Virginia Secondary School Activity Commission's high school classifications, the school has 1,739 students and the average classroom size is twenty-five. The Wood County School District has 13,746 students in 29 schools. Its partner in education is DuPont. Parkersburg High is the second-largest populated school in the state of West Virginia (behind Cabell Midland High School in Ona, WV) and has the largest campus in West Virginia. The feeder schools contributing to this student population are Jackson Middle School, Hamilton Middle School and Van Devender Middle School. When the current high school campus opened in 1917, the former high school building was re-established as Washington Junior High School. Previously, Washington Junior High School fed PHS as well. The Washington Jr. High School building was demolished in 1964. Washington Junior High then opened in the former Jefferson Elementary School on Plum Street, adjacent to a newly built Jefferson Elementary School. Washington Junior High closed in 1992, combining with Jefferson Elementary School to become an elementary center in 1998. History Parkersburg High School was one of the first high schools in the state of West Virginia. The school was founded in 1867, originally located in downtown Parkersburg. The current building housing PHS has a Tudor Style architecture with three stories. It was designed by noted Ohio architect Frank Packard (1866‚Äì1923), and built in 1917, making it one of the oldest school buildings in West Virginia. It remains the largest high school campus in the state. Later additions included Stadium Field and the Field House, a multi-story gymnasium.http://www.lctrcrl.com/parkersburg/highschool-nw.html It is located in the Parkersburg High School-Washington Avenue Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historical Places in 1992. PHS continued to serve as the only high school in Parkersburg, at one point holding a population of around three thousand students. It was only after graduating a class of eleven hundred thirty seven (1137) students in 1965 that a second public school, Parkersburg South High School, was founded in 1967. This in turn started a rivalry between the two schools that continues to be one of the largest and most famous in the state of West Virginia. The rivalry between the two sides of Parkersburg originated much earlier in the town's history, so the rivalry between the two schools was a natural spin-off that has brought about some dramatic competition. Planetarium The construction of a planetarium was conducted in the 1960s through the joint efforts of the Rotary Club of Parkersburg, Corning Glass Works, the National Defense Education Act (NDEA) and the Wood County Board of Education. Cost for constructing the room and purchasing equipment was $32,770.00. It is one of the first high schools in America to have a planetarium.-Ken Gilbert, former Art teacher, PHS. Parkersburg High School Foundation (History). Data Processing Center During the 1965-66 school year, PHS became one of the first high schools in the United States to offer students classes in data processing and computer programming in the \\"new\\" and expanding technology. The Burroughs computer required a huge, temperature controlled room of its own, and had a memory capacity of 640 Kb‚Äîconsidered top-of-the-line then. It used six phone booth- sized magnetic tape readers for computations.Verification of Burroughs model number needed. in 1967, upon completion of the second high school, the computer center was re-located to the new building.

WV Chapter, National Wrestling Hall of Fame Mascot, Alma Mater, and School Colors The nickname \\"Big Reds\\" came to PHS in 1915 with the arrival of Ralph Jones, who came from Denison University. The Big Reds of Denison were an athletic power at the time and their colors were red and white. The name was adopted by Parkersburg, as well as the school colors. The mascot of PHS is the Big Red Indian. It was adopted in 1961. The Alma Mater of PHS is set to the tune of the song \\"Spanish Chant\\", also known as \\"Spanish Hymn\\". This is the same song used by Ohio State University for their alma mater, and is known there as Carmen Ohio. The PHS alma mater pre-dates Ohio State's. The lyrics used by Parkersburg are: :\\"O PHS to you sing praise :And songs to alma mater raise, :While we strive to keep thy name :Forever in the halls of fame :Mountains fair and valleys bright :Renew the path for banners bright :Times of joy or times of stress :We‚Äôll always love you, P-H-S\\" Music PHS is home to musical ensembles that are regarded as some of the most successful ones in the state. The most recognizable ensemble is the Parkersburg Big Red Band. In addition to these groups, Parkersburg High School has a percussion ensemble, jazz ensemble, chamber choir, men's ensemble, and women's ensemble. Choral Music The A Cappella Choir was formed in 1931 with its first director, Dr. Marie Boette (pronounced Bo-tee), after she sent some of her students to Detroit to an A cappella singing competition. This led to the formation of West Virginia's first A Cappella Choir in 1932, as a way to present advanced music without accompaniment. The robes are a white cotta (or surplice) worn over a red cassock, similar in form to Roman Catholic or Episcopal altar boy or chorister vestments, and have remained the same since the inception of the choir. They were initially created by Hazel McHenry. The choir is best known for its annual Christmas Concert, which begins with \\"Fanfare for Christmas Day\\" sung in the grand hall. The choir will then process to \\"O Come, O Come Emmanuel\\" by candlelight (originally real candles and then replaced by electronic ones). The concert ends with the \\"Hallelujah Chorus\\" from Handel's Messiah, where all alumni come up to sing with the choir. Finally, the choir recesses to \\"O Come, O Come Emmanuel\\" by candlelight. The Parkersburg High School A Cappella Choir has performed for two presidents: Harry S Truman in 1949 and Lyndon B Johnson in 1966. It also performed in Washington DC in 1997. The choir were selected as an honor group for the 2000, 2002, 2005, and 2018 West Virginia Music conferences. In April 2010, they performed in Carnegie Hall alongside OSU's choir and a few other high school and college choirs. They performed two pieces (a work by Brahms and a work by Amy Beach) under the direction of Dr. Hilary Apfelstadt. The Chamber Choir sang at two professional basketball games, in 2004 and 2005. They were invited to sing again in 2006. In addition to this, they were with Parkersburg South's Chamber Choir and West Virginia University at Parkersburg's chorus in premiering \\"The Unknown Region\\" by Kenton Cole. Most recently, the Chamber Choir was selected to sing during the 2019 White House Christmas Open Houses in Whashington DC. The current choral director is Joshua A. Dubs, a graduate of Geneva College. Due to the 2008 grade shift in Wood County Schools, a new choral organization was formed for 9th graders who were not inducted into the A Cappella Choir called the Freshman Choir. In its first year, there were over eighty members in this organization. All four of the schools vocal music programs are internationally awarded. The choir takes an annual competition trip and has competed in such cities as New York City, New Orleans, Toronto, Boston, Orlando, and many others. The choirs always do very well in competition, often bringing home gold 1st places in each category. Instrumental Music The Big Red Band was first a concert band only organized in 1919 and was under the direction of C. O. Chapman. The first Big Red Band as a marching band was organized under George Dietz in 1924. It was all-male and women were not allowed into the band itself until 1970. The Big Red Band is the only military-style marching band in the state of West Virginia and prides themselves on being a music making organization first. History The original uniforms for the band were all white with red trim and buttoned down the middle. They featured red capes and red navy-style dress uniform hats (similar to the ones worn by the Navy ROTC at PHS). The current uniforms have been essentially the same since at least 1955, with the only noticeable change being the crossbelts. Originally they were just one sash crossing over the body; the current ones have two sashes (which in 1955 were worn by the field commanders) that criss-cross the band member with the right one over the left one. The current uniforms also are made of wool and are red tops with white bottoms. The uniform top has two sets of silver buttons, one for each side, and the uniform pants have a red stripe down each outward facing side. The field commander's uniform has seen its share of changes also. Originally, there were multiple field commanders/drum majors. One wore an all red uniform with the same styled white hat, and the others wore the white uniforms that eventually became the current field commander's uniform. The current field commander uniform was all white with a tall white hat with the 1955 set, this was changed slightly to include a red breastpiece and yellow shoulderpieces. The crossbelts worn by them in 1955 became the current crossbelts for the band. The field commander uniform lacks a crossbelt. The Big Red Band has its own fair share of recognition, performing at the World's Fair in 1982. They were also in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in November 1992. They also performed in the Kentucky Derby Pegasus Parade in 1995, and are regularly invited to participate in New Year's Day \\"bowl festivities.\\" Also, the Big Red Band won two Veterans of Foreign Wars junior band championships, one in Boston (1955) and one in Dallas (1956) and are one of only a few groups at PHS to be able to call themselves national champions. The band also won the Lion's Club International Band Contest four times: in Providence (year unknown), Chicago (1937), Pittsburgh (1939), and New Orleans (1941). They performed for the National Moose Convention in 1948. In addition, they were selected as the best band in the state in 1930 and won the tri-state band concert in 1933. The band received the Ohio State Governor's Cup in the fall of 1991. The concert and jazz band also traveled to New Orleans for the Heritage Festival national competition in the 2004-2005 school year, the jazz band ended up taking 2nd place nationally and the concert band 1st place. The band has performed for Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush during their visits to Parkersburg as Presidents of the United States. They also played for Queen Marie of Romania during an incidental visit to Parkersburg (this was due to a snow squall hitting the area, forcing the Queen's train to stop) in 1926. Fine arts With active drama, dance and forensics programs, the fine arts department at Parkersburg High School is widely recognized as one of the best and fastest growing in the state. Drama The Parkersburg High School drama program is split between the PHS Drama Club and Thespian Troupe #264, which work together to produce plays as the combined \\"PHS Players.\\" Drama Club members work towards earning enough Thespian \\"points\\" in order to be inducted into the Troupe at a ceremony which takes place at the end of each school year. The Troupe is one of the oldest in the country, considering that there are currently over 4000 registered school and became registered with the International Thespian Society while former Broadway actor John Lee was teaching as Parkersburg High School's Director of Performing Arts in the 1960s and 70s. Other past directors include Connie Brant, Heather Gates-Rusher, Amanda Witt, and current teacher Lori Zyla.

Best actor for the regional festival for this production was Dan Strimer, who also won runner-up best actor for the WV state competition for the same play that year in Morgantown, WV. In 2009, under the direction of Amanda Witt, Thespian Troupe #264 placed in the top five schools at the West Virginia Thespian Festival in the one-act play competition against thirteen other schools statewide for their performance of Bradley Hayward's Imaginary Harry. Other awards to PHS at the 2009 Festival included the naming of Frankie Love (Harry) and Jamie Mace (Mom) as All State Cast Members and Scarlet Sheppard (Jamie) as WV Best Actress. PHS Thespians were awarded a $10,000 grant towards representing West Virginia at the International Thespian Festival in Lincoln, Nebraska in June 2009 making them State Champions.20 The troupe travelled and performed, and were named one of the Top Five one-acts at the International Festival. Imaginary Harry playwright, Bradley Hayward, travelled from his home in Canada to see PHS's performance and now features videos of PHS's version on his professional website. In 2010, under the direction of Amanda Witt, Thespian Troupe #264 again placed in the top five schools at the WV State Thespian Festival for their performance of Shirley Lauro's \\"A Piece of My Heart.\\" Other awards to PHS at the 2010 Festival included the naming of Audriana Davis (Leeann) as WV Best Actress, Danielle (Steele) as WV Best Supporting Actress and first place in Solo Musical Theatre Performance, second place in Stage Management to Meghan Handley, third place in fantasy makeup to Brittani Hill and a Best Sound Design award to Timm Romine.

Under the direction of Lori Zyla, Troupe #264 has placed in the top five schools at state festival, once in 2011 and once in 2015, and continues to be competitive at the state festival. Dance The dance program at PHS consists of students taking dance classes for arts credits. Along with learning about the history and application of dance around the world, dance students also perform at multiple venues such as the annual Justo Lamas concerts presented for Spanish language students and the Parkersburg High School Talent shows. Forensics The Parkersburg High School Forensics Team consists of a Speech team and Debate team under coach Lori Zyla. Both teams travel and compete together around the state and at a \\"home\\" Tournament dubbed the Isenhart Invitational in spring. The Forensics Team sponsors various fundraisers including the Mister and Miss PHS Pageants held in April. In 2008, three competitors from the PHS Speech Team won at the state level in their respective \\"events\\" (Original Oratory and Duo Interpretation) and a bid to compete at the Grand National Tournament in Appleton, Wisconsin where all three did well, but did not \\"octofinal\\" or go on to place nationally. In 2009, Parkersburg High School was awarded third place overall at the State Tournament behind Wheeling Park High School and Huntington High School. At the Qualifying tournament, two PHS team members were selected as alternates for the 2009 National Tournament. Also in 2009, Senior Speech Captain Valerie Price was named PHS's first All American by the National Forensic League, the oldest and largest speech and debate honor society in the nation. All Americans are students with exceptional combined achievements in GPA, Test Scores and NFL (National Forensics League) points earned through performance at tournaments. In 2010, Parkersburg High School was awarded third place overall at the State Tournament. In 2017, six of Parkersburg High School's students qualified at the state level and went on to compete in the Catholic League Grand National Tournament in Louisville, Kentucky. They competed in Declamation, Original Oratory, Duo Interpretation, and Public Forum Debate. Academics Parkersburg High School consistently beats the state averages on standardized tests. 9th Grade Math 69% proficient vs state average of 61%. 10th Grade Math 60% proficient vs state average of 54%. 11th Grade Math 60% proficient vs state average of 58%. Athletics Parkersburg High is well known for its athletic achievements. The school is known as \\"The School of Champions\\" and holds twice as many state titles in athletics as any other high school in West Virginia. The football team has the 12th most victories in the United States with 827 (as of 8/20/2019). For the first time in one hundred three years of PHS football, 2007 marks the first time the team has won back to back state championships (2006 and 2007). The boys' and girls' soccer teams are also 2006 state champions with the boys' team having won two in a row, making for a state record four state championship wins for one high school. The boys' team is also currently ranked 24th in the nation. Parkersburg High School is also famous for the achievements of its wrestling team including a 2006-07 and 2007-08 AAA State Championship of their own, tying the Wrestling team with the PHS Boys' Tennis Team, which has 21 titles, the record for the most titles for one team in West Virginia. PHS was rated by Sports Illustrated as the #9 sports high school of all time due to its long winning traditions and graduates such as Earl \\"Greasy\\" Neale who is in the Football Hall of Fame as well as other graduates such as outfielder Nick Swisher of the New York Yankees (and formerly of the Chicago White Sox and Oakland Athletics), and Larry \\"Flash\\" Rhodes. Parkersburg High experiences a very strong rivalry with cross-town high school Parkersburg South High School. The rivalry is recognized as one of the best in the state. Former PHS quarterback, Don Reeves, became the Big Reds Head Football Coach on February 11, 2010. Following the 2010 season it was discovered PHS was voted the top football team in West Virginia for the 1918, 1919, 1921, 1922 & 1927 seasons making Reeves the first coach to claim 5 State High School Championships in his first season as head coach. During the summer of 2008, due to the successes of the Parkersburg athletic programs, Parkersburg, West Virginia was featured on ESPN as a candidate for Titletown USA. Parkersburg came in as the runner-up in the Titletown voting process, losing to Valdosta, Georgia.

This led to plans to build the world's first true rocket festival. Three X-Prize Cups have been held: in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Each X Prize Cup hosts different events and demonstrations, such as rocket-powered bicycles, rocket jet packs; but particularly notable are the Lunar Lander Challenge and the Space Elevator Games. 85,000 visitors attended the 2007 X Prize Cup. Although there was no X Prize Cup in 2009, there was a Lunar Lander Challenge. Motivation A demonstration of the \\"rocket bike\\" at the 2006 Wirefly X Prize Cup This X Prize was first proposed by Dr. Peter Diamandis in an address to the NSS International Space Development Conference in 1995. The notion of a competitive goal was adopted from the SpaceCub project, demonstration of a private vehicle capable of flying a pilot to the edge of space, defined as 100 km altitude. This goal was selected to help encourage the space industry in the private sector; so government funding to entries is not allowed. The X Prize Cup aimed to demonstrate that spaceflight can be affordable and accessible to corporations and civilians, opening the door to commercial spaceflight and space tourism. It is also hoped that competition will breed innovation to develop new low-cost methods of reaching Earth orbit. The X Prize Cup offers monetary rewards and organizational support to the community of aerospace professionals‚Äîand by staging Earth's great space exposition. The X Prize was modeled after many prizes from the early 20th century that helped prod the development of air flight, including most notably the $25,000 Orteig Prize that spurred Charles Lindbergh to make his solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean. NASA is developing similar prize programs called Centennial Challenges to generate innovative solutions to space technology problems. 2004 Ansari X Prize The original Ansari X Prize was a US$10,000,000 prize, offered by the X Prize Foundation, for the first non-government organization to launch a reusable crewed spacecraft into space twice within two weeks. It was modeled after early 20th-century aviation prizes, and aimed to spur development of low-cost spaceflight. The prize was won on October 4, 2004, the 47th anniversary of the Sputnik 1 launch, by the Tier One project using the experimental spaceplane SpaceShipOne. The success and popularity of this event lead to the following events which were called the X-PRIZE Cup. 2006 Wirefly X Prize Cup Dan Schlund, the Rocket Man at the 2006 Wirefly X Prize Cup Wirefly was named the official title sponsor of the competition in 2006, and the event for that year was held on October 20‚Äì21 in Las Cruces, New Mexico, and represented an effort by the X Prize Foundation to continue encouraging innovation in the private sector. The 2006 Wirefly X Prize Cup focused on rocketry and lunar landing technology, offered up $2.5 million in prizes to teams competing in several distinct competitions related to the general theme. The exposition also featured high-powered rocket launches and exhibits intended to boost public interest in aerospace technology. In December 2006, the Cup's organizers announced expansion plans based on the success of the October event. With the success of the original X Prize competition, the open competitions for $2.5 million in monetary prizes were the highlight of the 2006 Wirefly X Prize Cup. The aerospace teams in Las Cruces fought for the top prize in three events‚Äîthe Lunar Lander Challenge, the Vertical Rocket Challenge, and the Space Elevator Games. In addition to the featured competitions, the Wirefly X Prize Cup included a series of rocketry exhibitions and educational presentations. \\"Rocketman\\" Dan Schlund demonstrated his \\"Rocketbelt,\\" a device which allows him to soar above the earth with a rocket strapped to his back. The Rocket Racing League debuted the Mark-1 X-Racer, a preview of next-generation motor sports. Other attractions included high-powered rocket launches, a student competition, a symposium on personal spaceflight, and an assortment of ground displays and simulators. 2007 X Prize Cup The 2007 X Prize Cup, was held at Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo, NM, on October 26‚Äì28. The 2007 X Prize Cup also marked the rebirth of the Teacher in Space Project, when the Space Frontier Foundation and the United States Rocket Academy announced the competition rules and begin accepting applications for the first Teacher in Space \\"pathfinder\\". Aircraft as well as rockets were featured at the event, along with the Lunar Lander Challenge. 85,000 people attended the event. The Armadillo Aerospace team successfully completed the first of two legs of the $350,000 prize Level 1 Lunar Lander Challenge on 27 October 2007 by completing a flight above 50 m altitude and moving horizontally to a second pad for landing after more than 90 seconds of flight time. The prize was not claimed in 2007 as the rocket engine experienced a hard start on the second leg return flight, resulting in a cracked engine, excessive loss of fuel, and an inability to remain in the air for the full 90 seconds required. No other competitor was able to achieve even a successful first leg of the competition. Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge Armadillo's \\"Pixel\\" in test flights before the 2006 competition The Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge (NG-LLC) is intended to accelerate the commercial development of a vehicle capable of launching from the surface of the Moon to lunar orbit and back. The competition is part of NASA's Centennial Challenges program. Such a vehicle would have direct application to NASA's space exploration goals as well as the personal spaceflight industry. The prize may also help the industry build new vehicles and develop the operational capacity to operate quick turnaround vertical take-off, vertical landing vehicles. To win, the team's rocket must take-off vertically, climb at least 50 meters above the pad, fly for a minimum amount of time and land on a target that is 100 meters from the takeoff point. The team can then refuel the rocket, which must then fly back to the original pad. There are two levels to the competition. In Level 1 the vehicle must be in the air on each leg for 90 seconds. A $350,000 prize is given to the first successful team, and $150,000 to the second. In Level 2 the vehicle must be in the air on each leg for 180 seconds to win the $1 million prize. Space Elevator Games In 2006, the Space Elevator Games took place at the Wirefly X Prize Cup. A space elevator is a theoretical system using a super-strong ribbon going from the surface of the Earth to a point beyond geosynchronous orbit. The ribbon is held in place by a counterweight in orbit. As the Earth rotates, the ribbon is held taut. Vehicles would climb the ribbon powered by a beam of energy projected from the surface of the Earth. Building a space elevator requires materials and techniques that do not currently exist. The Space Elevator Games are meant to stimulate the development of such materials and techniques. The games are divided into two categories: the Power Beam Challenge and the Tether Challenge. In the Power Beam Challenge, each team designs and builds a climber (a machine capable of traveling up and down a tether ribbon). The climber must carry a payload. Power will be beamed from a transmitter to a receiver on the climber. Each climber must travel to a height of 50 meters traveling a minimum speed of 1 meter per second. The Tether Challenge is to help develop very strong tether material for use in various structural applications. The 2007 Space Elevator Games were not held at the Wirefly X Prize Cup. Instead, they took place in Salt Lake City. Pete Conrad Spirit Award The Pete Conrad Spirit Award, instituted in 2007 and named for American astronaut Pete Conrad, is given to students between the ages of 13 and 18 that develop a new concept to benefit the personal spaceflight industry. This award was presented to the finalists at the 2007 X Prize Cup.

The temple layout is in a cruciform with several terraces leading to a small pagoda at the top covered by an umbrella known as hti, which is the name of the umbrella or top ornament found in almost all pagodas in Myanmar. The Buddhist temple houses four standing Buddhas, each one facing the cardinal direction of East, North, West and South. The temple is said to be an architectural wonder in a fusion of Mon and adopted Indian style of architecture. The impressive temple has also been titled the \\"Westminster Abbey of Burma\\". The temple has close similarity to the Pathothamya temple of the 10th‚Äì11th century, and is also known as ‚Äúveritable museum of stones‚Äù. The temple was damaged in the earthquake of 1975. However, it has been fully restored and is well maintained by frequent painting and whitewashing of the walls. On the occasion of 900th anniversary of its construction celebrated in 1990 the temple spires were gilded. It is a highly revered temple of Bagan. Etymology The name Ananda of the temple is derived from the Venerable Ananda, Buddha's first cousin, personal secretary, one of his many principal disciples and a devout attendant. It was once known as Ananta Temple, coming from the phrase 'ananta pinya' in Sanskrit, which translates as \\"endless wisdom\\". However, the word 'ƒÄnanda' in Pali, Sanskrit as well as other Indian languages mean \\"bliss\\". It is a popular Buddhist and Hindu name. The attributes of the Buddha, his infinite wisdom \\"Anandapinnya in Burmese and Pali\\" is commemorated in its name 'Ananda'. Legend The legend associated with building of this temple ended in tragedy for the builders. Eight (8) monks who approached the King Kyansittha seeking alms gave a graphic description of the Nandamula Cave temple in the Himalayas where they had meditated. When the king invited them to the palace to hear more details, the monks invoked their meditative psychic skills and vividly explained to the King, the landscape of the place they had lived. The King, pleased with this show of their skills, requested the monks to build a temple in the middle of the Bagan plains creating cool conditions in the temple. After the monks completed the temple construction, the King, in order to retain the uniqueness of the temple, got the architects (monks) killed to ensure that another similar structure was not built by them anywhere else. You could see it only in Bagan George Coedes states a different fate for the architect, \\"he and a child were buried alive to serve as guardian spirits of the temple.\\" History History of this perfectly dimensioned temple structure built in 1105 is credited to King Kyansittha. It denotes \\"the stylistic end of the Early Bagan period and the beginning of the Middle period\\". The timing of building this temple is considered as a culmination of religious education that began during the Pahothanya temple building activity in 1080 AD. The Theravada Buddhism adopted by the King motivated him to present the teachings of Buddha to his people in an accurate and a genuine way through the medium of this temple, to unite Burma under one flag and thus \\"creating mass religious enthusiasm\\". It has been inferred that the King, as the upholder of the Law wanted to convey his firm belief in the Buddhist doctrine according to his interpretation: > (He) shall purify (and) make straight, write down (and) establish all the > holy scriptures. (He) shall proclaim (and) voice the Law, which is even as a > resounding drum. (He) shall arouse all the people that are slumbering > carelessly. (He) shall stand steadfast in the observance of the commandments > at all times. Through the unique iconographic depictions (in stone images, the numbered jataka plaques and the standing Buddha images), presented in the symmetrically planned layout of the Ananda temple was built by the King Kyansittha to establish and convey his doctrine to his people in a vivid visual format. It is said that the King who founded this temple became illustrious in the sphere of Buddhist architecture.  Architectural history The architectural history of the temple has been widely analysed. While the Mon architecture of Burmese origin is noted, strong influence of Indian Architecture from many temples of Bengal and Orissa is very clear. In this regard archaeologist Duroiselle has made these observations: \\"There can be no doubt that the architects who planned and built the Ananda were Indians. Everything in this temple from Shikara to basement, as well as the numerous stone sculptures found in its corridors, and the terra-cotta plaques adorning its basement and terraces, bear the indubitable stamp of Indian genius and craftsmanship...In this sense we may take it, therefore, that the Ananda, though built in the Burmese capital, is an Indian temple.\\" It is also said that the architecture of this temple greatly represents the Ajanta cave temple in Udayagiri hills in Orissa, India. The temple is being restored with the help of the Indian government.https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-pm-modi-prays-at-iconic- ananda-temple-in-myanmar-which-india-is-helping-rebuild-2543432 Architecture Ananda temple is a perfectly dimensioned stylistic structure, a fusion of Mon and Indian architectural styles and is the central monument built in the Pagan valley. It has been built with bricks and plaster depicting iconographic images in stones and plaques (terra-cotta glazed tiles) with the main purpose of educating the people of the region in the religious ethos of Theravada Buddhism and in accordance with the personal beliefs of the King Kyansittha. Layout Frescoes of Buddha from birth to death depicted in the passage The temple structure is in the form of a simple corridor. It has a central square of ; gabled porches project out by from each face of the square. The superstructure is in height formed by decorated terraces. The total length of the temple from end to end is about . In the crucifix layout adopted for the temple, the main plinth over which two receding curvilinear roofs have been built followed by four receding terraces above it. The four terraces lead to the top, where it terminates in a small pagoda and an umbrella known as hti, which is the name of the top ornament found in almost all pagodas in Myanmar. The core part of the temple, at the centre of the terraces, is in the shape of a cube, which houses the four standing Buddha massive statues on its four faces, each of height (above a high throne). The spire rises above this cubic structure. Two passages delimit the central cube, with the four sides of the cube; each face is decorated with a massive image of the Buddha. The four entrances are provided with teak wood carved doors in the interior and these entrances form a perfect cross or cruciform. A stupa finial crowns each entrance. Jataka scenes (life story of the Buddha ‚Äì said to be sourced from Mon texts) are embossed over 554 terra cotta tiles that decorate the base, sides and terraces. Each niche, inside the four entrances of the cubical structure, form the sanctum where standing Buddhas, fully gilded and in different mudras or forms are deified and worshipped. The two circumambulatory passages have vaulted roof. In these inner passages, surrounding the central cubicle, sculptural ornamentation in the form of 80 large reliefs carved out of volcanic rocks, representing Buddha's life from birth to death, are depicted. The two main passages have cross passages also, which provide the link between the porch and the standing images of the Buddha. The external walls of the temple are in height. They are adorned with fortified parapet walls. Each corner has a ringed pagoda. Buddhas The four standing Buddhas (pictured) are adorned with gold leaf and each Buddha image faces a direction, from north to south, stated to represent attainment of a state of nirvana; each is given a specific name, Kassapa (in PƒÅli, it is the name of a Buddha, the third of the five Buddhas‚Äô of the present kalpa (the Bhaddakappa or 'Fortunate Aeon'), and the sixth of the six Buddhas prior to the historical Buddha) ‚Äì south facing, Kakusandha (in (PƒÅli) is the name of the twenty-fifth Buddha, the first of the five Buddhas of the present kalpa, and the fourth of the seven ancient Buddhas) ‚Äì north facing, Konagamana (the name of the twenty-sixth Buddha, the second of the five Buddhas of the present era, and the fifth of the seven ancient Buddhas) ‚Äì east facing, and Gautama facing west. Out of the four images, the images facing north and south are said to be original, of the Bagan-style depicting the dhammachakka mudra, a hand position symbolizing the Buddha's first sermon, while the other two images are new replacements, after the originals were destroyed by fires. All the four images are made of solid teak wood (some say that the southern image is made of a bronze alloy). The four Buddhas placed in the sanctum, called the \\"Buddhas of the modern age\\", give an indication of Buddha's \\"sense of the omnipresence through space and time\\". The original south facing Buddha (called the Kassapa) has a unique architectural display, as, when it is viewed from close quarters depicts a sad look. However, the same image viewed from a distance gives an expression of mirthfulness. The east and west facing Buddha images are made in the later Konbaung or Mandalay style. The east-facing image of Buddha (known as 'Kongamana') is shown holding, between the thumb and middle finger, a small nutlike sphere ‚Äì a herb. This herb is said to symbolically represent the Buddha suggesting dhamma (Buddhist philosophy) as a cure for misery and distress. In this mudra, both arms hang at the sides with palms stretching out. This mudra is not seen in traditional Buddhist sculpture outside this temple. In the west-facing Buddha, titled Gautama, the abhaya mudra is displayed ‚Äì with hands outstretched in the gesture of fearlessness. At the feet of this Buddha two life-size statues made in lacquer, representing the crowned figure of King Kyanzittha kneeling piously in prayer, and Shin Arahan, the Mon monk who converted the King into Theravada Buddhism (meaning \\"the Teaching of the Elders\\") and as a primate also crowned the king, are also displayed. The western portico also depicts two Buddha footprint symbols on pedestals. An inscription below the small image of the King states that the King perceived himself as a \\"bodhisattva, a cakkavattin and incarnation of Lord Vishnu\\". Plaques A typical plaque with inscription at the bottom Plaques are a special feature in the temple complex, which depict jataka tales; each plaque made of glazed Terra-cotta tiles representing one story of the jataka. Plethora of plaques is seen on the temple walls and terraces (five numbers). These are: at the base of the structure extending, from south to west, there are 552 images of Mara‚Äôs marching warriors intending to attack Buddha, and also a procession of gods; west to the north entrance warriors are shown vanquished by supernatural powers of Buddha; southwest comer of the first terrace to the northern side of the third terrace display 537 plaques, each related to a specific story from Jataka tales; on the northern side of the second terrace up to the fifth terrace depictions are from Tey Mi Jataka; the fifth terrace depicts 547 plaques of stories of Vessantara Jataka in two parts, 537 plaques in the first tier and the second set above the first tier on the roof depict 375 plaques of the last ten jatakas, the Mahanipata; the last ten lives of the Buddha are depicted in plaques of green colour. There are depictions of camels on the plaques, suggesting the influence of trade routes on the region. Stone images The stone sculptures, in the outer vaulted corridors, are considered unique in Bagan. 1500 stone images (mostly unclear due to wear and tear) are seen inside the temple. The special images carved from a single rock (average size is high, broad and thick) are those that depict 80 episodes from Buddha's life. Also seen are forty episodes from the last life of the Lord Buddha, beginning with an image of Setaketu Deva to Prince Siddhartha peeping through the tapestry for a last look at his consort Yasodhara and his newborn son Rahula, before he left the palace for the life of recluse in the forest. Paintings Wall paintings inside the prayer halls of the temple have been mostly white washed. Some of the paintings still discernible on the south-west column of the northern devotional hall have been restored by the Department of Archaeology of Myanmar. Some of the paintings seen in good condition are: on the walls and ceiling of the eastern devotional hall; the pictures of re-appeared Buddha, north of the statue of standing Buddhas, Arahats and lotus flowers; and floral designs on the western entrance. Other structures Ananda Oakkyaung is simply a Monastery built with red bricks, located within the precincts of the Ananda Temple. It was built in 1137 AD. Paintings of the 18th century are seen in the walls of the monastery, which also have an inscription that attributes building of the monastery to three brothers. Shin Thuddhamma Linkara, a highly venerated monk lived here. Tharabha Gate is the only surviving gate of the ancient Bagan city (previously known as Pagan); the Ananda temple is located to its southeast. Tharabar, a word derived from the Pali word \\"Sarabhanga\\", which literally means \\"shielded against arrows\\". Tharabar was one of the 12 gates of entry to the Pagan city built by King Pyinbya, in 849 AD. Some stucco engravings of Ogres are still seen on the gate. It is believed that two spirits protect it namely, the brother \\"Lord of the Great Mountain\\" on the left of the gate and the sister \\"Golden face\\" on the right side. Museum A field museum has been established near the Ananda temple in Pagan. The purpose is to study the artifacts in the ambience of their original settings. Festivals The temple is also home to an annual week-long festival that is held during the month of Pyahto (December to January). During the festival, 1000 monks perform continuous chanting of scriptures for 72 hours. Thousands of villagers from miles around set up encampments around the temple. On the morning of the full moon day, they offer gift bowls to the monks in attendance.

The small pagoda, which has a bulbous shaped dome, is widely believed to have been built by the third King of Pagan, Pyusawhti who ruled from 168 to 243 AD. It is one of the most notable shrines among the thousands of new or ruined Pagodas in Pagan, which is located about south of Mandalay. The original pagoda was completely destroyed in the 1975 earthquake. As result of this earthquake, the bulbous pagoda broke into pieces and fell into the river. It was, however, fully reconstructed using modern materials, with lesser adherence to the original design. Subsequently, it was built as a gilded superstructure. Etymology 1975 earthquake. The name 'Bupaya' is made up of two words 'bu' and 'paya' in the Burmese language. As the pagoda is bulbous and in the shape of gourd or pumpkin, the word 'Bu' in Burmese, which means \\"pumpkin\\" or \\"gourd\\" is the affixed to 'paya'. The word 'paya' means \\"pagoda\\". It is also said that King Pyusawhti, builder of the Pagoda, got the river bank deweeded as it was infested with gourd-like plant, considered a 'menace'. Legend According to a legend, Pyusawti who built this pagoda, as a young man defeated \\"Five Great Menaces\\" that were detrimental to the interest of the city of Pagan. One of these five menaces was the extensive proliferation of the plant vines of gourd (at the location where the Bupaya Pagoda was built later). Subsequently, the then King pleased with the gallant act of Pyusawti gave him, as a reward, his daughter in marriage. Later, Pyusawti became the King of the region. During his reign, he built pagodas at each of the places where he had destroyed the 'Menaces'. Geography The Pagoda is built on the edge of the Irrawaddy River (it is Myanmar's largest commercial waterway), within the walled city of Pagan (a large capital city of the Burmese Kingdom between the 11th and the 13th centuries), over a series of crenellated terraces. The river takes a bend at this location. It acted as a guide landmark to navigators. It was built amidst a huge bush. History The dating of this pagoda has several versions. According to the earliest claimed historical records, the Bupaya Pagoda claimed as the oldest, was built in the 3rd century by the third king of Pagan, Pyusawdi, who ruled from 168 to 243 AD. However, it is also reported that the pagoda was commissioned in the 2nd century by King Pyusawti. On the basis of similar pagodas and city walls built in Pagan, it has been conjectured that Bupaya Pagoda was built in the 9th century or even 11th century. However, the old pagoda getting destroyed completely and falling into the Irrawaddy River during the 1975 earthquake, has indelibly scotched any arguments on the subject of its dating. Structure A new pagoda at the entrance to the main Bupaya Pagoda in Bagan. In keeping with the tradition of building pagodas in Myanmar, the Bupaya Pagoda also conformed to the norms set for such structures. The pagoda had a massive gravity-type pyramidal profile. It was built with bricks and impressively decorated. It was a bell-shaped dome built over diminishing terraces. A finial crowned the dome. The pagoda enshrined Buddha's relics. However, the new Bupaya Pagoda built at the same location in 1976‚Äì78, after the earthquake, is a hollow reinforced concrete structure (replacing the traditional brick structure of the past). It has been built on the traditional plan of a polygonal base. The pagoda rises up in \\"a series of crenellated semi-circular terraces overlooking the river\\". It is now fully gilded (pictured). The pagoda is now a very distinct landmark on the shores of the Irrawaddy River.

He obtained a research appointment in the Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry at McGill University in MontrealEmmanuel Delille, \\"On the History of Cultural Psychiatry: Georges Devereux, Henri Ellenberger, and the Psychological Treatment of Native Americans in the 1950s\\", Transcultural Psychiatry, 53 (3), 2016, p. 392-411.. Later (1962), he went on to become Professor of Criminology at the Universit√© de Montr√©al, in Canada. There he was to do pioneering work on victimology, exploring the psychodynamics between offender and victim.Ann W. Burgess et al, Victimology (2009) p. 40 Publications and awards Ellenberger is chiefly remembered for The Discovery of the Unconscious, an encyclopedic study of the history of dynamic psychiatry published in 1970. This work traced the origins of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy back to its 18th-century prehistory in the attempts to heal disease through exorcism, as practiced by the Catholic priest Johann Joseph Gassner, and from him through the researchers of hypnotism, Franz Mesmer and the Marquis de Puys√©gur, to the 19th century neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot and the main figures of 20th century psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler and Carl Gustav Jung. Robin Skynner praised the clarity of its presentation of the ideas of the great twentieth-century figures in their socio-historical contexts.Robin Skynner/John Cleese, Families and how to survive them (1994) p. 301 Ellenberger's account of Pierre Janet has also been singled out for special mention; while Anthony Stevens has made use of his concept of \\"creative illness\\" in his account of Jung. Gay also singled out for mention Ellenberger's 1972 article on Anna O, which Gay considered \\"persuasively corrects Jones's misreading and Freud's misremembering of the case\\".Gay, p. 751 It was however only one of the thirty-five or so historical articles Ellenberger published both before and after his great synopsis.Micale, p. 112 The Resource Center Henri Ellenberger in Paris was named in his honor. During his lifetime he received many awards, including the Gold Medal of the Beccaria Prize in 1970, and the Jason A. Hannah Medal of the Royal Society of Canada. Characterisation Ellenberger has been characterised as one of the mid- century, interdisciplinary independents in psychiatric thought.Micale, p. 113-4 His unique career path and independent, if moderate, Freudian revisionism, made him at times an isolated figure, especially with the biological turn in psychiatry at the close of the twentieth century.Micale, p. 113 His own belief in the central importance of the reality of the unconscious never faltered, however, even with the fading of his dream of a synthesis that \\"would do justice to the rigorous demands of experimental psychology and to the psychic realities experienced by the explorers of the unconscious\\".Ellenberger, p. 897 From 1956 to 1959, Ellenberger started teaching the history of psychiatry at the Menninger Foundation (where George Devereux already gave a lecture on psychoanalysis and anthropology).Emmanuel Delille, \\"Teaching the History of Psychiatry in the 1950s: Henri Ellenberger‚Äôs Lectures at the Menninger Foundation\\", Zinbun, 47, 2016, 109-124. The experience of exile played a key role in explaining the Ellenberger's interest in history.Delille, p. 120-2 Criticism Ellenberger has been criticised for modelling his picture of the origins of psychiatry in the Enlightenment clash with Demonology ‚Äî in the triumph of illuminated reason over the blindness of faith.Micale, p. 227 Works * The Discovery of the Unconscious: The History and Evolution of Dynamic Psychiatry.

The essence of each competition was to design, build and race super-efficient vehicles that achieved 100 MPGe (2.35 liter/100 kilometer) efficiency, produced less than 200 grams/mile well-to-wheel CO2 equivalent emissions, and could be manufactured for the mass market. Within the Competition Division, there are two vehicle classes: Mainstream and Alternative. The mainstream class had a prize of $5 million. The alternate class had two separate prizes of $2.5 million, one for side-by-side seating and one for tandem seating. The PIAXP has an Educational Program, funded by a $3.5 million grant from the United States Department of Energy, to engage students and the public in learning about advanced vehicle technologies, energy efficiency, climate change, alternative fuels, and the science, technology, engineering, and math behind efficient vehicle development. History The X Prize Foundation began work on the development of a competition to spur innovation in the automotive industry in 2005 and on 6 March 2006 announced that Mark Goodstein would join the Foundation as an Executive Director of the new prize. A little more than year later, on 12 April 2007, the Foundation formally announced the creation of the prize at the 2007 New York Auto Show and set the purse at $10 million for a car that could get and be sold for a reasonable price. In the subsequent year, the X Prize Foundation solidified sponsorship for the prize and on 20 March 2008 announced that Progressive Insurance would be the Title Sponsor of the Prize and fund the $10 million purse. From that point onward, it was known as the Progressive Insurance Automotive X Prize (PIAXP). At the 12 April 2007 announcement of the creation of the X Prize, the Foundation released draft Competition Guidelines, which were open for public comment from 2 April to 31 May 2007. The latest guidelines were published on 10 January 2009. The competition guidelines are the product of hundreds of volunteers of the AXP and world-class advisors. On 7 April 2009, the X Prize Foundation announced that 111 teams had registered by the February 2009 deadline. By 20 October 2009, the design judging had winnowed the number of teams down to 43, with some publicly, and others quietly, withdrawing. The formal vehicle competition events began on 26 April 2010, and consisted of the remaining four stages: Shakedown (26 April ‚Äì 7 May 2010), Knockout ( 16‚Äì30 June 2010), Finals ( 19‚Äì30 July 2010) and Validation (August 2010). Winners The winners of the competition were announced on 16 September 2010. * Team Edison2 won the $5 million Mainstream competition with its four-passenger Very Light Car, obtaining 102.5 MPGe or just below 69 MPG running on E85 fuel. * Team Li-Ion Motors won the $2.5 million Alternative Side-by-Side competition with their aerodynamic Wave-II electric vehicle achieving 187 MPGe. * Team X-Tracer Switzerland won the $2.5 million Alternative Tandem competition with their 205.3 MPGe faired electric motorcycle. Vehicle requirements Within the Competition Division, there are two vehicle classes‚ÄîMainstream and Alternative‚Äîboth of which have the same requirements for fuel economy and emissions, but differing design constraints. The Alternative class is further divided into tandem and side-by-side classes. Vehicles in the Mainstream Class must meet specifications that are derived from typical small, five-passenger, economy mixed-use vehicles. The Alternative Class has fewer performance and design restrictions and provides an outlet for innovation. Both classes allow entries that are modifications of an existing popular vehicle, provided that all PIAXP requirements are met. Vehicles in both classes must have a fuel economy of 100 MPGe (21 kWh or 2.35 liters of petrol/100 kilometer) and produce less than 200 grams/mile CO2 emissions (measured well-to-wheel). For electric vehicles, the CO2 emissions requirement is a more binding constraint. Because CO2 emissions will be calculated assuming a national average of electricity sources projected to 2014, an all-electric car will have to achieve 114 MPGe in order to produce less than 200 grams/mile CO2 emissions. Further, electricity consumption is measured at the \\"plug\\" side of the battery charging device, so it would have to achieve 114 MPGe, assuming 100% efficient battery charging. If the charger were 85% efficient, this requirement would grow to 134 MPGe. In the other words, efficiency of electric cars should be not 21 but 16 kWh/100 km. Vehicles in both classes also must have features expected of a modern automobile including an enclosed cabin with windshield and windows, operating windshield wipers, washers, headlights, horn, indicators, brake lights, reflective devices, rear and side-view mirrors, and seat belts. They must have the usual automotive controls, including accelerator pedal, brake pedal, steering mechanism (not necessarily a wheel) and indicators. They must be \\"highway capable\\", which is defined as the ability to maintain on a four percent uphill grade and to accelerate from to in less than 9 seconds. They must be able to brake from 60 to 0 mph in less than , meet existing noise standards and use tires that meet automotive or motorcycle (alternative class only and only if the vehicle is otherwise eligible to be classified as a motorcycle) standards. Both must meet the same set of static and dynamic stability requirements. The mainstream vehicle must seat at least four adults with at least two side-by-side front seats, have at least of useful cargo space in one contiguous location not counting the passenger seats, accelerate from 0 to in 15 seconds or less, and be able to drive without refueling or recharging. The mainstream vehicle must have four or more wheels. The alternate class vehicle must seat at least two people, accelerate from 0 to in 18 seconds or less, and be able to drive without refueling or recharging. The alternative vehicle has no minimum number of wheels, but it must remain upright when stopped with no driver inputs. While the main focus of PIAXP is fuel economy and carbon emissions, not safety, the vehicles must be \\"production capable\\". Therefore, the entries must either be fully compliant with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) and other applicable National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) requirements or compliance has to be \\"designed in\\". For example, allowance for airbags in the designs is considered acceptable without actually installing the airbags. Teams are also required to submit a business plan which clearly demonstrates an ability to produce 10,000 vehicles per year. Note that teams are not required to be under-taking this plan, but the plan has to exist and the car has to be designed such that this plan is feasible. With the lack of mainstream entrants from established automobile companies, a Demonstration Division was created so that automakers could at least display and promote their highest efficiency vehicles alongside the main competition. However, there were too few entrants by 1 March registration deadline, and this division was canceled. The only confirmed entrant was the Tesla Roadster, which had dropped out of the main competition. Vehicles in the Demonstration Division would have met the same requirements as Mainstream Class vehicles in the Competition Division, except for MPGe and CO2 emissions. There was no Alternative Class equivalent in the Demonstration Division. These vehicles would have been stock vehicles, i.e., vehicles identical to those for sale or pre-production prototypes of vehicles intended for sales. Vehicles in the Demonstration Division would have been tested in the same way as Competition Division vehicles and would have participated in the PIAXP competition events under the same rules in order to demonstrate and showcase their capabilities and performance. Competition events The competition timeline was finalized as follows: Design judging Accepted teams must provide evidence that their vehicles are production capable, by providing a detailed Data Submissions covering four areas: * Safety and Emissions: Vehicles must be designed so that, in production, they meet U.S. safety standards (FMVSS) and U.S. emission standards. * Manufacturability and Cost: Vehicles must be capable of being manufactured in quantities of 10,000 per year with production costs within levels consistent with that production volume. * Features: Vehicles must have the features expected by consumers for vehicles within the projected prices range. * Business Plan: There must be a credible plan to manufacture, sell and support 10,000 vehicles (or conversions) per year by 2014. The plan must address required fuel infrastructure if it does not already exist. Those that pass this hurdle will be invited to bring their vehicles to the competition events. The design judging was closed in October 2009, with 43 teams remaining. Shakedown stages The first three stages will be a \\"shake-down\\" period and performance in these stages will not count to final scores. The first step of the competition will be the review of technical reports, technical inspection of the vehicles and performance testing of safety elements to eliminate unsafe vehicles. The two-week shakedown took place at the Michigan International Speedway, from 26 April to 7 May 2010. Those that pass the initial technical and safety inspections and tests will participate in the remaining competition events. These include stage races, additional active safety performance tests and a dynamometer test. Knockout stage The next stage will be a \\"knockout\\" qualifying event. To advance, vehicles must pass active safety performance tests, meet acceptable emission levels and demonstrate at least 67 MPGe on a test track. These were held at the Michigan International Speedway from 20 to 29 June 2010. After this stage, only 15 vehicles from 12 teams remained in the competition. Finals stage The final stages will determine the winning teams. To complete the race successfully, vehicles must maintain a minimum average speed (maximum allowable time) while meeting PIAXP requirements for fuel economy (90 MPGe) and emissions. The finals also include a tie breaking race; the vehicle with the best overall time while still meeting requirements will take the purse. The final stages are scheduled for 19‚Äì30 July 2010 at the Michigan International Speedway. Validation stage The few remaining teams were validated on dynamometers under laboratory conditions at the EPA Labs in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Argonne National Laboratory in Chicago, Illinois. This stage is scheduled for August 2010. The validation results count toward 50% of the final efficiency figures, which together must exceed 100 MPGe. Edison2 was an exception. The engines in both Very Light Cars failed before validation. Edison2 was allowed to circumvent the rules governing procedures and provided independent third-party validation reports instead of undergoing the same validation testing as other finalist teams. Educational program The United States Department of Energy joined the PIAXP as a sponsor, funding an educational program targeted to young people. The first component of the Education Program is a web site created in partnership with Discovery Education, www.FuelOurFutureNow.com, featuring activities for K-12 students, as well as videos, virtual labs, and interactive resources intended for use in school and in the home. Competing teams Although 111 teams registered for the PAIXP and paid the registration fee, by 20 October 2009, the number of teams had decreased to 43, sponsoring 53 vehicles between them. These remaining teams represented 10 countries (some entries listed two countries of origin) with 28 coming from the United States and 7 from the state of California. Of the 53 vehicles, 28 were in the Alternative Classes and 25 in the Mainstream Class. By 15 April, only 30 teams remained. After the shakedown completed in May, 22 teams remained. A sample of the teams is shown below. Mainstream * American HyPower ‚Äì The \\"Zams\\" is a modified 2009 Toyota Prius.

The composer's brother Modest claimed this work cost Tchaikovsky more labor and suffering than any of his other works.Brown, David, Tchaikovsky: The Early Years, 1840‚Äì1874 (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc., 1978), 99 Even so, he remained fond of it, writing to his patroness Nadezhda von Meck in 1883 that \\"although it is in many ways very immature, yet fundamentally it has more substance and is better than any of my other more mature works.\\"Brown, 102; Warrack, 48 He dedicated the symphony to Nikolai Rubinstein. Form # Dreams of a Winter Journey. Allegro tranquillo (G minor) # Land of Desolation, Land of Mists. Adagio cantabile ma non tanto (E-flat major) #:This movement has an essentially monothematic structure, based on subtle gradations and variations on a single melody.Maes, 79‚Äì80. # Scherzo. Allegro scherzando giocoso (C minor) #:This was the earliest movement to be written. Salvaged from the third movement of a piano sonata that he had written as a student, Tchaikovsky transposed the movement down a semitone to C minor and replaced the trio with the first of a whole line of orchestral waltzes. # Finale. Andante lugubre - Allegro maestoso (G minor ‚Üí G major) #:Tchaikovsky uses the folk-song \\"–†–∞—Å–ø–∞—à—É –ª–∏ —è –º–ª–∞–¥–∞, –º–ª–∞–¥e—à–µ–Ω–∫–∞\\" (Raspashu li ya mlada, mladeshenka) as the basis for both the introduction and the second subject (in B minor). This song also colors the vigorous first subject. Tchaikovsky had borrowed the folk-song motive into the prelude and the finale of his Cantata for the Opening of the Polytechnic Exhibition in Moscow 1872 (commemorating the bicentenary of the birth of Peter the Great).Tchaikovsky Research: Cantata for the Opening of the Polytechnic Exhibition (TH 67)Tchaikovsky, in the recapitulation, restates the movement's introduction, instead of the secondary theme. The movement ends with a vigorous coda. Instrumentation The symphony is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets (A, B), two bassoons, four horns (E, F), two trumpets (C, D), three trombones (fourth movement only), tuba (fourth movement only), timpani, cymbals, bass drum and strings. Overview Composition Tchaikovsky started writing this symphony in March 1866. Work proved sluggish. A scathing review by C√©sar Cui of the cantata he had written as a graduation piece from the St. Petersburg Conservatory shattered his morale. He also composed day and night. All these factors strained Tchaikovsky's mental and physical health tremendously. He started suffering from insomnia, from pains in his head which he thought to be strokes, and became convinced he would not live to finish the symphony.Brown, 95‚Äì96; Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 47 A successful performance of his revised Overture in F in St. Petersburg lifted his spirits. So did a change of scene for the summer with his family. Nevertheless, he soon worked himself again into nervous and physical exhaustion by continuing to compose day and night. A doctor declared him \\"one step away from insanity,\\" ordering complete rest. Tchaikovsky complied. Despite his lack of progress, Tchaikovsky sought the opinion of his former teachers, Anton Rubinstein and Nikolai Zaremba, when he returned to St Petersburg at the end of August.Brown, 100; Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 47; Warrack, Tchaikovsky Symphonies and Concertos(Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1971, 1969), 15 He had hoped for their approval of what he had written as well as accepting at least part of it for a St Petersburg concert of the Russian Musical Society (RMS). Neither situation happened. Both men were negative, refusing to perform any of the symphony.Brown, 100 He stopped work to fulfill his first public commission, a festival overture based on the Danish national anthem to celebrate the Moscow visit of the future Tsar Alexander III of Russia with his new Danish bride.Brown, 100; Strutte, 21‚Äì22 Once the commission was finished, Tchaikovsky completed the symphony before the conservatory's Christmas break. This included modifications requested by Rubinstein and Zaremba as a condition for reconsidering the work. Tchaikovsky resubmitted the manuscript to Rubinstein and Zaremba during the Christmas break. Even with their insisted changes, they still disapproved of the symphony on the whole; however, this time they passed the adagio and scherzo as \\"being fit for performance\\". These two movements were played at an RMS concert in St Petersburg on February 23, 1867, with no success.Brown, 101; Strutte, 22 Tchaikovsky, who had looked upon St Petersburg as the premier musical location in Russia and been obsessed with having his symphony performed there first, was thoroughly disillusioned ‚Äî not only with St Petersburg audiences, but also with the critical judgments of both his former teachers. He discarded all the revisions they had demanded, standing with one exception by his original version. The exception, it turned out, was unavoidable. At Zaremba's insistence, he had composed a new second subject for the opening movement. He had discarded the papers that contained his original second subject, and he could not remember what he had originally composed. Tchaikovsky had to let the second subject as approved by Zaremba stand as it was.Strutte, 22; Weinstock, Herbert, Tchaikovsky (New York: Albert A. Knoff, 1944), 55, esp. footnote 6 Back in Moscow, Anton's brother Nikolai was willing to perform the symphony; only the composer's insistence on a St Petersburg performance held him back. Tchaikovsky now allowed him to conduct the scherzo at a Moscow concert of the RMS on December 22. Though the scherzo met with little success, Rubinstein was still ready to perform the complete work. This finally took place on February 15, 1868, to great success. Surprisingly, though, the symphony would have to wait 15 years for its next performance.Brown, 101‚Äì102; Strutte, 22 The first performance of the revised version took place in Moscow on December 1, 1883, under the baton of Max Erdmannsd√∂rfer. Struggles with form Tchaikovsky freely confessed later in life that he could not write within the proper rules of Western sonata form‚Äîthose rules of exposition and organic growth and development of themes that Germanic composers such as Haydn and Mozart had invented. Anton Rubinstein was a slavish follower of those rules in his own works. That may in turn have been a handicap for Tchaikovsky in writing Winter Dreams. He could not write a symphony that would please Rubinstein by staying firmly within a classical format while writing music that would stay true to his strengths as a composer.Weinstock, 51 This does not mean that Tchaikovsky was completely unable to work within musical form. While his natural aptitude for organic symphonic procedures may have certainly been limited, he may have actually done himself less than full justice.Brown, 108 This was Tchaikovsky's first large-scale work. Rubinstein and Zaremba's interference did not help: they only added to anxieties Tchaikovsky would have naturally had, in any case. The First Symphony forced Tchaikovsky to face the facts in one very important way. Before beginning it, he had been content to mould his music as best he could to the practice of previous composers. Winter Dreams forced him to realize he would have to work \\"around the rules\\" for him to grow and develop as a composer.Brown, 109 This meant adapting sonata form and symphonic structure to accommodate the music he was gifted to write. He would often show tremendous resourcefulness in doing this, even in this symphony. As musicologist David Brown wrote, \\"The opening stretch of the first movement is enough to scotch the hoary old legend that Tchaikovsky was devoid of any real symphonic aptitude.\\" Influences Teachers As opposed to the forward-looking tendencies of The Five, Anton Rubinstein and his followers remained suspicious, even hostile, to new trends in music. Instead, they attempted to preserve in their own works what they saw as the best in the Western tradition in the immediate past.Holden, Anthony, Tchaikovsky: A Biography (New York: Random House, 1995), 64 Though not active as a composer, Nikolai Zaremba was no exception to this rule. He idolized Beethoven, particularly the late works, but his personal tastes had progressed no further than Mendelssohn.Brown, 60 Rubinstein, a highly prolific composer in his own right, was almost as backward-looking as Zaremba, writing in a Germanic style similar to Schumann and Mendelssohn. Though as a teacher Rubinstein would try to foster his students' imaginations, he also expected them to remain as conservative as he was.Brown, 68. Mendelssohn Over the summer holiday with his family in 1866, when evening activities turned to music, Tchaikovsky invariably played Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony, Schumann's First or Third Symphonies, or Das Paradies und die Peri. Mendelssohn's presence is strong in Winter Daydreams, with a grace, lightness and pace throughout. The scherzo especially could have stepped from A Midsummer Night's Dream.Warrack, Tchaikovsky Symphonies and Concertos, 15‚Äì16 Both the symphony's subtitle and those of the first two movements‚Äî\\"Dreams of a Winter Journey\\" and \\"Land of Desolation, Land of Mists\\"‚Äîbetray a possible fondness of Mendelssohn's ability to express in symphonic form a personal experience arising out of emotion at a romantic landscape, though Tchaikovsky did not carry through this idea to the end (the latter two movements lack subtitles). Russia Even with these influences, Russian writer Daniel Zhitomirsky explains, \\"the subject, the genre and intonation\\" of Tchaikovsky's writing are closely intwined with Russian life and folk music.\\"Zhitomirsky, Daniel, ed. Shostakovich, Dmitry, Russian Symphony: Thoughts About Tchaikovsky (New York: Philosophical Library, 1947), 91 Warrack notes that \\"the obsessive thirds of Russian folk-song permeate Tchaikovsky's tunes; and he must also at some time been haunted by the interval of the falling fourth, so strongly does it colour the invention in the early symphonies, always prominently placed in the melodies and acting as emotional coloration rather than implying a harmonic progression.\\"Warrack, Tchaikovsky Symphonies and Concertos, 9 Notable recordings * Antal Dorati conducting the London Symphony Orchestra * Claudio Abbado conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra * Igor Markevitch conducting the London Symphony Orchestra * Michael Tilson Thomas conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra * Herbert von Karajan conducting the Berliner Philharmoniker * Eugene Ormandy conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra * Mariss Jansons conducting the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra * Yuri Temirkanov conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra * Bernard Haitink conducting the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra * Lorin Maazel conducting the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra * Zubin Mehta conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra * Riccardo Muti conducting the New Philharmonia Orchestra, London * Sir Neville Marriner conducting the Academy of St Martin in the Fields * Vladimir Jurowski conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra * Neeme J√§rvi conducting the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra Notes References * Brown, David, Tchaikovsky: The Early Years, 1840‚Äì1874 (New York, W.W.

It was declared the national sport in 1962. It has since thrived, especially in the more rural areas of the country. Chilean rodeo is different from the rodeo found in North America. In Chilean rodeo, a team (called a collera) consisting of two riders (called Huasos) and two horses ride laps around an arena trying to stop a calf, pinning it against large cushions. Points are earned for every time the steer is properly driven around the corral, with deductions for faults. Rodeos are conducted in a crescent-shaped corral called a medialuna. The sport, in its modern form, is strictly regulated. Chilean Horses are used exclusively and riders are required to wear traditional huaso garb. Rancagua hosts the annual Campeonato Nacional de Rodeo, the nationwide rodeo championship. The greatest rider in the sport's history is considered Ram√≥n Cardemil, who obtained the national title seven times; the last champions were Juan Carlos Loaiza and Eduardo Tamayo. Riders practice in the countryside throughout Chile, but is most popular in the central zone. Even so, huasos have been known to travel hundreds of miles to compete in competitions. The sport has become so popular that in 2004, more spectators attended rodeo events than professional football matches.Especiales de Emol.com  History  The birth of Chilean rodeo is placed in the 16th century during the rule of Governor Garc√≠a Hurtado de Mendoza. At the time, the cattle in Chile were not well identified and it was not uncommon for the animals to get lost. To help prevent the loss, Governor Hurtado proclaimed that, in Santiago, every 24th and 25 July, the commemoration of Saint Jacob - patron saint of the city -, the cattle would be gathered in the Plaza de Armas de Santiago to be branded and selected.Historia del rodeo chileno. P√°gina oficial de la Federaci√≥n del Rodeo Chileno In later years, this round-up became mandatory but, the date of the event changed to October 7, the day of Saint Mark. Though the purpose of the gathering remained the same, the riders had become extremely well trained with the constant work of transferring cattle to the various corrals.Origen del rodeo Especiales EMOL, Rodeo 2005 Towards the end of the 17th century, the rodeo begins to get regulated and is practiced in a rectangular track 75 meters long. The riders would bring out the cattle from the corrals and on the main track, display their abilities to separate a single calf and guide it without the help of other riders. All this activity was regulated and the most talented riders would receive honors and awards. In the year 1860, the medialuna type track becomes the dominant track form with one api√±adero and two quinchas, where the riders have to stop the cattle. The medialuna, at this time, has a radius of 20 to 25 meters. Standardization and regulation During the government of General Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo, in 1927, a law was passed regulating the \\"cattle runs\\", placing the Chilean rodeo under the supervision of the Chilean army. Rodeo became, by law, a national sport on January 10, 1962 by decree N¬∫269 of the National Council of Sports and the Chilean Olympic Committee.Rodeo chileno: c√≥mo naci√≥ nuestro deporte nacional Familia Beginning on May 22, 1961, the sport is regulated by the Federation of Chilean Rodeo.Federaci√≥n del Rodeo Chileno P√°gina del Portal del Rodeo Chileno In 1986, the National Federation of Rodeos and Huaso Clubs of Chile (Federaci√≥n Nacional de Rodeos y Clubes de Huasos de Chile) is founded to regulate, to a certain degree, the \\"labor rodeos\\" (rodeo tournaments not recognized by the Olympic Committee). In 1949, the first National Rodeo Championship occurs in the city of Rancagua and the very first champion was the team composed of Ernesto Santos and Jos√© Guti√©rrez. The riders with the most victories in the history of the championship are Ram√≥n Cardemil and Juan Carlos Loaiza, each having won the national title seven times. The most recent champions of the 2014-2015 season were Luis Ignacio Urrutia y Juan Ignacio Meza. Although the Chilean rodeo was declared a national sport, it finds itself in a precarious position in terms of finances, political support and promotion. Part of the reason for this is that the federation does not receive any of the revenue of Chiledeportes like the rest of sports federations in Chile. This is because only sports that represent Chile overseas receive funds. The Chilean Rodeo Federation has been critical of the government for the lack of funds towards the sport, arguing that because in many parts of the country, due to the distance from population centers, sporting events do not arrive, the local population turn to the rodeo as their primary pass time throughout the Chilean rural territory.El rodeo y las medialunas Nevertheless, thanks to the commitment and support of its many fans, the rodeo has maintained its popularity, especially in the rural areas, and its status as the second most popular sport in Chile.  Criticism  Animal rights organizations object to Chilean Rodeo and refuse to call it \\"sport\\". The arguments against this activity are related to the treatment the animals receive: the calf is driven near a wall and suddenly is hit by the horse's chest (a charge) in order to stop him. This occurs several times, although the calf is rarely injured or unwilling to stand up. There are constant inspections of the calf during the event to ensure that it is fit to continue. In 2006, a group of 40 people protested against Chilean rodeo outside Medialuna de Rancagua where the Campeonato Nacional de Rodeo (National Championship of Chilean Rodeo) was taking place. In 2010, a group of activists entered a medialuna in the middle of a rodeo to protest, and they were violently repressed by the huasos taking part in the event. A 17-year-old girl was lassoed, beaten and dragged out of the medialuna. Since then, other organizations are seeking a ban on Chilean rodeo. This is similar to the 2010 ban on Spanish bullfighting in Catalonia, Spain.

Professional wrestling career Early career Jones started wrestling in the NWA's Central States promotion in 1981 under the name Tommy Rogers (not to be confused with the Tommy Rogers of the Fantastics tag team). In the summer of 1984, he and Marty Jannetty formed a duo called the Uptown Boys, and twice won the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship.

It is tasked to collect actionable intelligence in advance of missions by other US special operations forces, especially 1st SFOD-D and DEVGRU in counter-terrorist operations. USAISA was the official name of the unit from 1981 to 1989; previously it was known as the Field Operations Group (FOG), created in September 1980. History Field Operations Group The Field Operations Group (FOG) was created in summer 1980 in order to take part in a second attempt to rescue the U.S. hostages held in the Tehran embassy after the failure of the Operation Eagle Claw. That operation had highlighted the U.S. shortfall in intelligence gathering.Memorandum for Director, Defense Intelligence Agency The Field Operations Group was under command of Colonel Jerry King, and operated in Iran, accomplishing various covert intelligence-gathering missions. The work accomplished by the FOG was successful, however the second attempt (called Operation Credible Sport), never took place because the air assets needed were not available.Richelson, Jeffrey T. Truth Conquers All ChainsBrief History of Unit After the cancellation of Operation Credible Sport, the FOG was not disbanded but enlarged. The administration saw ground intelligence contingencies as needing improvement if future special operations were to be successful (the CIA did not always provide all the information needed). So, on 3 March 1981, the FOG was established as a permanent unit and renamed US Army Intelligence Support Activity. This activity should not be confused with a later activity known as the Ground Intelligence Support Activity (GISA), as subordinated to the Army G2. Badge and insignia The current badge depicts an American bald eagle grasping a claymore, surrounded by a kilt belt, inscribed with the Latin translation of \\"Truth Overcomes All Bonds\\". In the original crest, the claymore was wrapped in a chain with one of the links broken as a reminder of those killed during the failed Operation Eagle Claw. This symbol of failure was later deemed no longer appropriate. The badge was deliberately designed by Jerry King and other founding members of the unit because of their shared Scottish heritage. The claymore is a greatsword originating from the Scottish Highlands, and the belt surrounding the badge is seen on Scottish clan badges (the belt signifies that the wearer is a member rather than the chief of the clan - the chief wears the badge without a belt surround). U.S. Army Intelligence Support Activity =Build-up= In 1981 the Intelligence Support Activity began to immediately select new operators, growing from FOG's 50 people to about 100. The ISA remained extremely secret; all of its records were classified under a Special Access Program (at first named OPTIMIZE TALENT). The ISA was given its classified budget of $7 million, a secret headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, and cover name, the Tactical Concept Activity. ISA included three main operations branches (Command, SIGINT and Operations), and an analysis branch, whose name changed over the years (e.g. Directorate of Intelligence, Directorate of Intelligence and Security).USAISA 1986 Historical Report and 1987 Historical Report Colonel Jerry King became ISA's first commander. ISA mission was to support Special Operations Forces (primarily Delta Force and SEAL Team Six) in counter-terrorist operations and other special operations units. The ISA would provide actionable intelligence collection, pathfinding, and operational support. The ISA performed several operations mainly in Latin America and the Middle East during the 1980s, but also in East Africa, South-East Asia, and Europe. The current organization of ISA is classified but does contain at least three squadrons (Operations, SIGINT and Mission Support/Communications). =First missions= The ISA conducted various missions, including giving protection to the Lebanese leader Bachir Gemayel and attempting to buy a Soviet T-72 tank from Iraq (a deal that was finally stopped by the Iraqis). =Dozier kidnapping, Operation Winter Harvest= On 17 December 1981, the senior U.S. Army officer in NATO Land Forces Southern European Command, Brigadier General James L. Dozier, was kidnapped from his apartment in Verona, Italy, by Italian Red Brigades terrorists. The search for General Dozier saw a massive deployment of Italian and U.S. forces, including thousands of Italian national police, the Carabinieri. The search also featured some unconventional participants, including \\"remote viewers\\" from Project Stargate and an international cast of psychics, largely orchestrated by General Albert Stubblebine, then-Commander of U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command INSCOM, and a great believer in the use of unconventional intelligence- gathering methods. An ISA SIGINT team was sent to Italy as part of Operation Winter Harvest and in conjunction with other Army SIGINT and counter- intelligence units, employed aerial and ground-based SIGINT systems to monitor and geo-locate terrorist communications. ISA and the other Army elements provided useful intelligence, helping Italian police to arrest several Red Brigades terrorists in mid-January 1982. The Italian police and intelligence agencies have never officially disclosed how they located General Dozier in late January 1982. However, U.S. Army participants in the operation have hinted that the mid-January arrests, the interrogation of those arrested, and follow-on investigations led to the eventual location of the Red Brigades hideout where Dozier was being held, in an apartment over a store in Padova. There is little doubt that the successful outcome resulted in part from the contributions of ISA's SIGINT specialists and the other supporting Army intelligence elements. General Dozier was freed unharmed by NOCS operators, also known as \\"The Leatherheads\\" for their unique headgear, on 28 January 1982. =Operation Queens Hunter= In early 1982, the ISA was needed to support a SIGINT mission in El Salvador, a mission that the CIA, the NSA and INSCOM were not able to accomplish. The task was submitted to the U.S. Army Special Operations Division (SOD), which started Operation Queens Hunter. Operating from a Beechcraft model 100 King Air flown by SEASPRAY (a clandestine military aviation unit) based in Honduras, ISA SIGINT specialists monitored communications from Salvadoran leftist guerrillas and fascist death squads, providing intelligence which helped the Salvadoran Army defend against guerrilla attacks. The success was such that the operation, planned to last a month, ran for more than three years. More aircraft were deployed, and eventually included eavesdropping on Honduran guerrillas too, as well as Nicaraguan Army units fighting against the Contras. =The POW/MIA affair= The ISA has also conducted an operation to search for US MIAs (soldiers reported as Missing In Action) allegedly held in South-East Asia in secret POWs camps in the 1980s. In 1979, U.S. intelligence thought it had located a POW camp in Laos using aerial and satellite photographs. A ground reconnaissance was needed to determine if people seen on photographs were really American POWs. At the same time, former Special Forces Major James G. \\"Bo\\" Gritz planned a private rescue mission with other S.F. veterans. Having informed U.S. government officials about the mission, Gritz was first told to abort his \\"mission,\\" but was eventually approached by the ISA. Nonetheless, Gritz was not believed to be doing serious work, and Pentagon officials ordered the ISA to terminate their relationship with him when they discovered that ISA had provided him with money and equipment. Operation Grand Eagle-aka \\"BOHICA\\" was an ISA Clandestine Armed Operation to seek intelligence on the fate of US military and or CIA personnel who may have been captured and left behind in Laos after the Vietnam war. ISA operatives were sent to Laos and located an armed encampment there that had at least two captured men, believed to be either US military personnel or \\"covert\\" operatives who were captured while engaged in either CBW drug smuggling, or some other \\"rogue\\" element of a secret team gone bad. This was detailed in two books, \\"BOHICA\\" by Scott Barnes an ISA operative on this mission and \\"Kiss the Boys Goodbye\\" by Monkia Stevenson both detailed the covert mission of Operation Grand Eagle. In 1989, the then USAISA commander John G. Lackey sent a telex \\"terminating\\" the USAISA term and his special access program Grantor Shadow. Colonel John Lackey served as unit commander from 1986 to 1989. However, the unit continued under a series of different Top Secret codenames which are changed every two years. Known codenames included Capacity Gear, Centra Spike, Torn Victor, Quiet Enable, Cemetery Wind, and Gray Fox. =Gray Fox= Gray Fox was the codename used by the ISA at the beginning of the War in Afghanistan. Its members often worked closely with Joint Special Operations Command and the Central Intelligence Agency.Marc Ambinder and DB Grady (2012) The Command: Inside the President's Secret Army In 2002, Gray Fox operators served alongside Delta Force and DEVGRU in the mountains of Afghanistan. Gray Fox intercepted enemy communications and trekked to observation posts with special operations units. Their efforts may have saved more than a hundred 10th Mountain Division and 101st Airborne Division soldiers fighting near Takur Ghar in Afghanistan's Shahikot Valley during Operation Anaconda. The unit helped spearhead the search for Saddam Hussein and his family after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Gray Fox operatives sometimes work under the broader umbrella of \\"Joint Special Operations Task Force 20\\", which also included DEVGRU, the Army's Delta Force, and 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. Saddam Hussein was eventually captured during Operation Red Dawn. Under the command of Colonel Michael K. Nagata from 2005 to 2008, Gray Fox continued to operate in Iraq and Afghanistan alongside US Special Operations Forces. To this day, the term \\"Task Force Orange\\" is used when referring to the unit's reinvigorated new role as not just intelligence gathering, analysis, support etc. for other Tier 1 Special Mission Units but also as an element capable of doing similar skillset-related taskings such as direct action or hostage rescue. Under Joint Special Operations Command In 2003, the Intelligence Support Activity was transferred from the Army INSCOM to Joint Special Operations Command, where it was renamed the Mission Support Activity. Since 2005 onward, the ISA has not always operated under a two- worded Special Access Program (SAP) name (Grey Fox, Centra Spike, etc.). In 2009, the unit was referred to as INTREPID SPEAR, until this was revealed to have been leaked in an email to the Pentagon. In 2010 it was referred to as the United States Army Studies and Analysis Activity. Elements of the former ISA assisted in intelligence collection and analysis operations prior to and during the 2 May 2011 U.S. Special Operations Forces mission which resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. Elements of DEVGRU, along with the ISA, members of the CIA Special Activities Division, DIA,https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/ar690-950-4.pdf and the NSA combined to execute a raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan, which ultimately killed bin Laden and resulted in the deaths of several family members and associates. Recruitment, Training and Organization According to Sean Naylor in Not a Good Day to Die, most (but certainly not all) Activity operatives come from United States Army Special Forces, due to their self-reliance and specialized skill-set.Sean Naylor (2006). Not a Good Day to Die: The Untold Story of Operation Anaconda. New York: Berkley Books. . Candidates also come from the other military branches. Most candidates assigned to the Operations, Communications and/or SIGINT squadrons go through an assessment and selection course, as well as a lengthy background investigation and psychological testing. Once admitted, they receive further training in a specialized Training Course. Like all units, this Intelligence Support Activity contains operational detachments as well as support detachments such as intelligence analysis, medical, logistics. HUMINT and SIGINT Candidates must have previous training in tactics, such as CQC, sniper, counter-sniper, and source development. Foreign language skills, although highly desired, are not a prerequisite to becoming a member of the ISA, though to be a SIGINT/HUMINT operator in the field with other Special Mission Units, working clandestine operations in non-permissive environments, knowing a minimum of several languages is usually indispensable (e.g. Persian, Arabic, Pashto, etc.). Some of the disciplines focused on in the training course are: infiltration techniques, advanced air operations, professional driving (offensive and off- road), personal defensive measures, and state-of-the-art communications, deep surveillance, tradecraft, weapons handling, hand-to-hand combat, signals intelligence, etc. See also * 13th Parachute Dragoon Regiment, a similar unit of French army special forces * 14 Intelligence Company, a similar unit in the United Kingdom Special Forces, superseded by the Special Reconnaissance Regiment * Joint Task Force X, a similar unit in the Canadian Forces Intelligence Command References Bibliography * Secret Warriors: Inside the Covert Military Operations of the Reagan Era, by Steven Emerson, G.P.

Morrison was the son of Scottish immigrants to Canada from the Isle of Lewis, born in the Hebridean-Scots community near Lac-M√©gantic in Quebec, Canada. At the age of 20 Donald moved to Western Canada and the United States where he learned the cowboy trade, and became skilled both with guns and horses. The money he earned was sent home to help pay for the family farm. Unfortunately Donald's father Murdo Morrison mortgaged the homestead to Lieutenant Colonel Malcolm MacAulay, who took advantage of Murdo's illiteracy and cheated him out of his farm. When Donald returned home he hired a lawyer and tried to keep them from losing the farm. Nevertheless, the farm was sold and the Morrisons were evicted. Donald was angry enough to harass the new owners at this point, and when the barn burned down he was blamed and a warrant put out for his arrest. The longest manhunt in Canadian history then followed. An unsavory American special constable and whiskey smuggler named Jack Warren was called in to capture Donald, bragging that he could outshoot him; he paid with his life. Donald was hunted in the wilds of Lac-M√©gantic from June 1888 until April 1889; for 10 months he evaded lawmen. Much of the time he was hidden by sympathetic supporters in the Scotstown community. At times he passed by detectives with such cool reserve that they did not suspect him, unwittingly having him inches within their grasp. A truce was finally arranged, but Donald was ambushed and shot. He was arrested and tried in Sherbrooke, Quebec, and although he had acted in self- defense was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 18 years hard labour. The worst punishment of all was the removal of his freedom, and he stopped eating, contracting tuberculosis. He died four hours after being released from prison (on clemency), and was buried on the Stornoway road in the Gisla cemetery in Megantic. A yearly festival is held in the Donald Morrison domaine to commemorate Donald Morrison and the Scottish Pioneers who settled the Megantic area. His story was romanticized in poem-form in the book The Canadian Outlaw (1892) by Oscar Dhu (Angus Mackay), Donald Morrison 'The Megantic Outlaw' (1948) by Henry G. Kidd, and in The Outlaw of Megantic (1973) by Bernard Epps. His life is the subject of a Gaelic-language concept album The Megantic Outlaw (2007) by Calum Martin.

The temple was originally at the center of a walled enclosure, of which only the north gate remains. It sits on a platform that is approximately on each side. The east side has a projected entry hall, while each of the north, south, and west sides has a protrusion and six entry points. The temple exterior resembles a series of square \\"cubes\\", stacked on top of each other, separated by seven receding terraces. Each corner of the terraces is adorned with stupa obelisks on square bases. The elevated central tower, or sikhara, is on each side. The temple's architectural height (nyandaw) is tall;Myo Nyunt Aung 2017: 32 its pinnacle height is . It is the tallest temple in Bagan. It is not the tallest structure in Bagan, however; the tallest is the Shwesandaw Pagoda, which is at least tall, without counting the hti spire. The five-story temple served not only as a place of worship but also as a monastery and library. The temple's first and second floors were used as the residence of monks; the third floor was used to hold images; the fourth was used as a library; and the fifth stored relics.Arch. Report 1902: Form A page 2 The interior of the temple consists of \\"pointed arches in the spacious hallways and barrel vaults in other areas\\".

The 1975 earthquake left the temple with heavy damage. The top finial of the sikhara, the main Buddha statue on the 3rd floor, and the corner stupas were all damaged. Vertical cracks measuring up to in width appeared on the exterior walls of the third floor.Myo Nyunt Aung 2017: 33 The damages were repaired by 1979, and the structure was further strengthened in the early 1990s. More maintenance work such as waterproofing of terraces and repointing the exterior were undertaken in the 2000s. Under construction in 2018 after the 2016 earthquake The temple was badly damaged after a 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit the Bagan region on 24 August 2016. It was one of the 36 worst-hit structures, and sustained several horizontal and vertical cracks throughout the structure across all floors, and terraces. Masonry works at the bottom were further damaged by rain. The temple's structure was reinforced with Chinese assistance in 2017.

At First Bull Run, he was wounded and captured, but later exchanged. He fought at Second Bull Run and Antietam, where he was badly injured when his horse fell on him. While recuperating, he served on the Fitz John Porter court-martial, a highly political case, where his loyalties are believed to have cost him promotion. Later he commanded a division in the Overland campaign, and a corps in the Shenandoah Valley Campaign under Sheridan, where he received a chest wound at Cedar Creek that disabled him for life. Early life and career Ricketts was born in New York City. He graduated 16th in a class of 31 at the United States Military Academy in 1839 and was assigned to the 1st U.S. Artillery. Ricketts was married twice, first to Harriet Pierce, in 1840, daughter of Benjamin Kendrick Pierce (brother of future U.S. President Franklin Pierce) and Josette Laframboise. They had one child, a daughter Mary Brewerton Ricketts, born in 1842. After Harriet's death in 1854, he married Frances \\"Fannie\\" Lawrence.Collective biographies of women: Frances Lawrence Ricketts, University of Virginia He served during the Canada border disturbances on garrison duty and then was promoted to first lieutenant in April 1846. Ricketts saw considerable action during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, participating in the Battle of Monterrey, and as commander of a gun, along with Abner Doubleday, held the Rinconada Pass during the Battle of Buena Vista. Despite his active service, he received no brevet promotions during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, unlike many of his fellow officers. Following his return from Mexico, Ricketts served in various army posts. He was promoted to captain in August 1853 and served in Florida against the Seminole Indians, and subsequently on frontier duty in Texas. Civil War At the beginning of the Civil War, Ricketts served in the defenses of Washington, D.C., and commanded an artillery battery in the capture of Confederate-held Alexandria, Virginia, in early 1861. His battery was then attached to William B. Franklin's Brigade of Samuel Heintzelman's Division. He was shot four times and captured at the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21 when his battery, Battery I, 1st U.S. Artillery, was overrun by Confederate infantry. For his personal bravery in the face of overwhelming odds, on that same day Ricketts was brevetted as a lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army. He was confined as a prisoner of war in Richmond, although his wife Fannie was allowed to travel to Richmond and stay with him as his nurse. On December 18, 1861, he was exchanged for Confederate Colonel Julius A. De Lagnel. Ricketts was not paroled until January 1862, when he was placed on medical leave to recuperate. On April 30, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Ricketts a brigadier general of volunteers to rank from July 21, 1861.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 727 The President had nominated Ricketts for the promotion on March 27, 1862, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on April 28, 1862. James and Fannie Ricketts On his return to duty, Ricketts was assigned to command of a division in Irvin McDowell's corps, which he commanded at the Battle of Cedar Mountain, where he covered Nathaniel P. Banks's withdrawal. At Second Bull Run, his division was thrown forward by McDowell into Thoroughfare Gap to bar the advance of James Longstreet, who was seeking to unite his wing with that of Stonewall Jackson. Ricketts, who was being flanked and in danger of being cut off, withdrew. At the subsequent Battle of Antietam, he had two horses killed under him and he was badly injured when the second one fell on him. When he recovered sufficiently for duty, he was appointed to the Fitz John Porter court-martial. The trial was created to convict, with every judge beholden to Edwin M. Stanton for tenure or impending promotion except for Benjamin M. Prentiss. Ricketts probably voted for acquittal and was not promoted. He did not return to the field until March 1864, when he was assigned to a division of John Sedgwick's VI Corps, which he led through Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign. Many of his men were former members of Robert H. Milroy's maligned Winchester command. The division performed poorly at the Battle of the Wilderness and without note at Spotsylvania Court House. However, Ricketts received the brevet of colonel, Regular Army, for gallant and meritorious services at Cold Harbor, Virginia, June 3, 1864, where he and his men performed well. In July 1864, Ricketts and his command, numbering only 3,350 men, were hurried north to oppose Jubal Early's attack on Washington, D.C. Ricketts fought at the Battle of Monocacy under Major General Lew Wallace, suffering the heaviest losses while holding the Union left flank. For his service there, on December 12, 1864, President Lincoln nominated Ricketts for appointment to the brevet grade of major general of volunteers, to rank from August 1, 1864, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on February 14, 1865.Eicher, 2001, p. 714 Ricketts was engaged in Philip Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley Campaign. At the Battle of Cedar Creek, he commanded the VI Corps in the initial hours of the fighting but was wounded by a Mini√© ball through his chest that disabled him for life. Despite his poor health, he returned to command of his division two days before Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House, April 9, 1865. Postbellum career In late July 1865, Ricketts was assigned to the command of a district in the Department of Virginia, a post he held until April 30, 1866, when he was mustered out of the volunteer service. On April 10, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Ricketts for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general, United States Army, for gallant services at the Battle of Cedar Creek, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on May 4, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 736 On July 17, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Ricketts for appointment to the brevet grade of major general, United States Army, \\"gallant and meritorious service in the field,\\" to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on July 23, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 708 Ricketts was appointed lieutenant colonel, 21st U.S. Infantry in July 1866, but he declined the post. Ricketts retired from active service on January 3, 1867, due to disability from wounds received in battle, and served on various courts-martial until January 1869. He was placed on the retired list as a major general in the regular army, to rank from January 3, 1867, the date of his retirement.Eicher, 2001, p. 702 Never in good health due to his chest wound suffered while serving in the Shenandoah Valley, after Ricketts retired from the army, he lived in Washington, D.C. for the rest of his life. He died there in his home on September 27, 1887 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His wife was buried alongside him when she died in 1900.

Early career Amparo Iturbi B√°guena was born in Valencia, Spain, the younger sister of Jos√© Iturbi. She gave her debut concert at the age of 15 in Barcelona. In 1925, she gave her first important concert outside Spain. She played in Paris, at the Salle Gaveau. This was followed by dual piano recitalsJean-Pierre Thiollet, 88 notes pour piano solo, ¬´ Solo de duo ¬ª, Neva Editions, 2015, p.97. with Jos√©, touring Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and England. She accompanied the famous Catalan soprano Maria Barrientos. It was not until 1937 that she first played in the United States. She had one daughter, also named Amparo, by a brief marriage. The younger Amparo led an internationally renowned flamenco troupe and taught dance. Amparo Iturbi was a pioneer of the Spanish piano repertoire in the U.S., until the arrival of Alicia de Larrocha in 1965. Notable students include Bruce Sutherland. Film career She had guest roles, playing herself, alongside her brother in the following MGM musicals: * Two Girls and a Sailor (1944) * Holiday in Mexico (1946) * Three Daring Daughters (1948) * That Midnight Kiss (1949) She was on the soundtrack of Three Daring Daughters (1948). √Åmparo Iturbi appeared in films only long enough to play the piano with her brother. Known for their twin piano-playing, the pair appeared on The Jimmy Durante Show in 1955 and on The Bell Telephone Hour in 1962. There were many recordings released as a duo and singly. A CD, \\"Celebrated Artistry- Mozart/Jos√© & √Åmparo Iturbi\\", was released in 1999. Damehood She was named a Dame of the Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic in 1958 in Spain. Honorary Scholarships *At California State University (Fresno), a special scholarship is available in √Åmparo Iturbi's name.\\"Awarded in honor of the distinguished concert pianist, Dame Amparo Iturbi, the scholarship, awarded annually, or as deemed appropriate is available to junior, senior or graduate students majoring in Piano.\\" *Jos√© Iturbi established a scholarship fund in memory of his sister, whom he outlived by more than a decade, for music majors, particularly those specializing in piano at Loyola Marymount University. Piano Instructor Amparo Iturbi gave piano lessons to selected students in the early 1960s from her home in Beverly Hills. Some students regarded her as somewhat \\"rigorous\\" due to the trademark Iturbi technique, which required that fingers be positioned at rest as harpsichord-like cocked hammers, waiting to strike down on the keys, touching fingertip only. Maintaining this position and executing a key strike without moving the adjacent fingers was mandatory and it was essential that the muscles and tendons of the forearm be \\"relaxed\\" at all times while playing. This near- counterintuitive technique was considered difficult or even painful by some pianists. Madame Iturbi, as she was fondly called by her students, would sit closely to the piano bench, with her fingers squeezing lightly on the forearm of the pianist, so she could detect any tension in the arm and correct it when needed. This process could in itself bring on tension since Madame Iturbi's reactions could be quite dramatic and startling. Additionally, anything resembling a \\"flat finger\\" hand position was strictly forbidden, and relaxing into this ghastly sloppiness would bring on a little swat of the hand as a reminder. Amparo was a fairly heavy cigarette smoker and would smoke continuously during piano lessons. Her students didn't appear to mind her smoking, however she had the notable habit of allowing the cigarette ash grow to a precarious length before tumbling on her clothes and/or the piano, which could be distracting to some students. Her colorful personality and storytelling made her a delightful and fascinating person to be around. She had regular piano recitals at her home for the more advanced students and her brother would sometimes attend. Her rate was $25 per hour in the early 1960s, but she showed kindness and generosity to beginner students by offering them her \\"scholarship\\" for good achievement, whereby one free lesson was given for each one paid. Her students loved her dearly and some would invite her to dinner at their homes on a regular basis. Death √Åmparo Iturbi died on 22 April 1969 in Beverly Hills, California, from a brain tumor, aged 71.

They were known for their bright colored tights and hanging bandanas. History The Rock 'n' Roll RPMs started in the World Class promotion, which at the time was still affiliated with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). They were known for their bright colored tights and hanging bandanas. The Rock 'n' Roll RPMs were glorified for their finishing move \\"The Spandex Splits\\". The move was later outlawed due to extensive neck injuries. They had feuds with several teams, including another \\"Rock 'n' Roll\\" tag team known as the Rock 'n' Roll Express. The Rock 'n' Roll RPMs went to World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico and feuded with Ron & Chicky Starr over the WWC World Tag Team Championship. The RPMs feuded with The Fantastics over the WCWA Tag Team Championship, however they were unable to win the championship. The RPMs also competed in the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) in Memphis, where they won the American Wrestling Association (AWA)'s Southern Tag Team Championship twice. Teaming with Cactus Jack, the Rock-n-Roll RPMs lost a match against Hector, Chavo, and Mando Guerrero at the only AWA pay-per-view SuperClash III.

Main memory is accessed using the high-bandwidth PCI-Express bus. TurboCache was developed as a means to provide a better cost/performance ratio by reducing the amount of memory modules on the video card. According to NVIDIA, a GeForce 6200 with TurboCache will perform about four times better than the Intel GMA 900. As with integrated graphics, the operating system may report a lower amount of main memory than is physically present when main memory is used. When TurboCache was introduced on the GeForce 6200 with TurboCache, there was confusion over how much local memory a buyer could expect from the TurboCache enabled video card. This figure could lie between 16-128MiB, with NVIDIA listing only total memory from both video memory and main memory. Eventually, NVIDIA included only video memory sizes on marketing and packaging. While TC can improve 3D quality in games using a great deal of video memory for texture rendering, performance of games utilizing a large percent of system RAM (such as EA Games' Battlefield series and their mods that typically consume 512MB-1GB RAM) can suffer dramatically on systems with 1GB RAM or below. Some users of such setups have attempted to disable TC. Such an option is not supported by NVIDIA's official drivers but can be accomplished using a registry modification for Windows XP users or a configuration file modification for X.Org Server users. A video card with TurboCache typically is slower in 3D benchmarks than a similar video card which has its own discrete video memory.

Burns (born September 19, 1942) is a psychiatrist and adjunct professor emeritus in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine and the author of the bestselling books Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy and The Feeling Good Handbook. Burns popularized Aaron T. Beck's cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) when his books became bestsellers during the 1980s. Early life and education Burns' father was a Lutheran minister. Burns received his B.A. from Amherst College in 1964 and his M.D. from the Stanford University School of Medicine in 1970. He completed his residency training in psychiatry in 1974 at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, and was certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology in 1976. Burns is the author of numerous research studies, book chapters and books. He also gives lectures and conducts many psychotherapy training workshops for mental health professionals throughout the United States and Canada each year. He has won many awards for his research and teaching, and has been named \\"Teacher of the Year\\" three times by the graduating class of psychiatric residents at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Burns was an early student of Aaron T. Beck, who developed cognitive therapy during the 1960s and 1970s. Cognitive therapy was also based on the pioneering work of Albert Ellis during the 1950s, who popularized the notion that our thoughts and beliefs create our moods. However, the basic concept behind cognitive therapy goes all the way back to Epictetus, the Greek philosopher. Nearly 2,000 years ago he wrote that people are disturbed not by things, but by the views we take of them. In other words, our thoughts (or \\"cognitions\\") create all of our feelings. Thus when we make healthy changes in the way we think, we experience healthy changes in the way we feel. Career TEAM Burns developed a new approach to psychotherapy called T.E.A.M. Therapy. T.E.A.M. is an acronym denoting: Testing, Empathy, Assessment of Resistance (formerly Agenda Setting) and Methods. These are the basic tools which separate TEAM therapy from other forms of cognitive behavioral therapies. TEAM addresses some of the shortcomings in cognitive therapy, and is based on the notion that motivation influences our thoughts, feelings, and actions just as much as our thoughts (or cognitions). Burns states that he draws from at least 15 schools of therapy, and hopes that the TEAM approach will be as revolutionary a breakthrough in psychotherapy as CBT was decades ago. Stanford Burns is on the voluntary faculty of the Stanford University School of Medicine, where he is actively involved in research and training. He has also served as a statistical consultant for Stanford's new Center for Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences Research. He has also served as Visiting Scholar at the Harvard Medical School and Acting Chief of Psychiatry at the Presbyterian / University of Pennsylvania Medical Center in Philadelphia. Burns Depression Checklist The Burns Depression Checklist (BDC) is a rating scale for depression copyrighted by Burns. The 1984 version was a 15-question survey; the 1996 revision is a 25-question survey. Each question is answered in the context of \\"during the past week, including today\\" and on a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 being \\"not at all\\" and 4 being \\"extremely.\\" For Burns, the BDC replaced Aaron Beck's BDI which appeared in the 1980 edition of Feeling Good (that Burns says he was grateful for permission to reproduce). Burns has also developed brief scales to measure depression, suicidal urges, anxiety, anger, and relationship satisfaction, as well as scales to assess the quality of the therapeutic alliance and effectiveness. These scales have high reliability (generally above .90) and each scale can be completed by patients and scored in less than 15 seconds. Burns and his colleagues require patients to complete these instruments in the waiting room just before and after each therapy session, so therapists can see how much progress the patient has made, or failed to make. Based on this information, therapists can change strategies if needed. Patients also rate therapists on warmth, empathy, and helpfulness in the waiting room after each session so therapists can see with much greater accuracy how their patients feel about them and the therapy.

Star Wars is an American epic space opera film series created by George Lucas. The first film in the series, Star Wars, was released on May 25, 1977 and became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon, followed by three sequels and three prequels. Many species of alien creatures (often humanoid) are depicted. Abednedo The Abednedo are a common sentient species native to the planet of the same name. Abednedos are tall humanoids with mouth tendrils, long faces, and widely spaced fleshy nostrils; often brown or tan in skin color. Abednedos appearing in the Star Wars saga include Resistance pilots Ello Asty and C'ai Threnalli. Abyssin The Abyssin inhabit the planet Byss. They are a nomadic race, often described as \\"brutish and violent.\\" They stand approximately two meters tall and have a humanoid appearance, with long limbs and weathered skin. They also possess a single large slit-pupiled eye which dominates their greenish-tan foreheads. Abyssins do not take kindly to derogatory nicknames regarding their eye, such as \\"monoc,\\" \\"one-eye,\\" or \\"cyclops.\\" They are quick to anger, especially when taunted or insulted. They are known to look for conflict and rarely show restraint. All Abyssins have the ability to heal quickly and to regenerate body parts, which leads to their belief that change is impossible, and as such they rarely stray from their home world. Abyssins dislike blaster fire and space-battles.Star Wars Ultimate Alien Anthology, page 7 Aleena The Aleena are a short-bodied alien race native to the planet Aleen. They are characterized by their thick bodies and short limbs. They waddle when they walk, and are ungainly to look upon. Their heads are dominated by a long, thin plate of body which extends back from the skull, and their faces are flat. Two little eyes sit over a wide mouth which is filled with short, sharp teeth. Individuals are bred for their color variation, another way they avoid becoming prey. As a people, the Aleena have a strong warrior tradition. They possess exceptional reflexes as well as a fast metabolism which allows them to convert food into energy very rapidly in order to escape predators (such as sagcatchers) on their harsh home planet. Amani The Amani are large aliens descended from planarian worms. They have long arms and a broad body, and their heads resemble that of a hooded cobra, but with a humanoid face. They hail from Maridun, where they prefer to travel in the trees, using their arms to swing among branches, but their shapes also allow them to curl into a ball and roll at incredible speeds. They organize into small tribes that form war with good Chiss parties to fight the other tribes for territory. They do not use technology and prefer to fight with spears and arrows, but they are vicious fighters and are galaxy-renowned for it. This reputation grew when they wiped out an entire stormtrooper division that had set up on their home planet. During and after the rule of the Empire, they sold their POWs into slavery. They are also popular as guards and bodyguards with the criminal elements of the galaxy. The Hutts are the biggest users of their services. An Amanin can be seen briefly in Return of the Jedi. This alien serves as one of Jabba's guards in his palace and can be seen guarding one of Jabba's most prized possessions: Han Solo encased in carbonite. He is yellow with brown/green stripes and carries a long spear decorated with severed humanoid heads. Amaran Amarans were fox-like sentients from the planet Amar. They also are in to animal trade. Annoo dat Prime The Annoo dat Prime is a four eyed, reptilian race hailing from the planet Annoo. The average height for an Annoo dat Prime is 8 feet. They tend to have rough, yellow scaled skin, with a small row of spines running down their backs and to the end of their short tails. They have four eyes, the upper two red and the lower two blue. The only Annoo dat Prime to ever be named or shown in expanded universe was the separatist General Ashaar Khorda. He appears in the Zam Wessel comic book, and subsequently dies following a plot to destroy Coruscant. Anomid Anomid are humanoid, with grey hair and silver-blue eyes, and are native to the Yablari system. They communicate largely using their own sign language. Boba Fett impersonated one in Rebel Dawn, part of the Han Solo trilogy of books. They are reportedly one of the more social species in the Star Wars galaxy. Ansionian Ansionians are tall and thin. In addition to possessing a single nostril, they have relatively large eyes. The Ansionians hail from the planet of Ansion, and are known to be lovers of peace. Many Ansionians, called Alwari, live in tribal factions on the plains, away from the human settler-created cities. They are relatively nomadic and resent technology and the fact that it has ruined the face of their planet, but not to such an extent so as to cause violence.Alan Dean Foster, The Approaching Storm (2002). Anzati These aliens appear similar to humans, the only differences being two prehensile probosci and a somewhat enlarged nose. People of their species are rare, but they have an impressive lifespan that can last for over a millennium. They tend to behave like vampires. The proboscises lie coiled and hidden in pockets within the cheeks and can be extended to drain a victim's 'luck' or 'soup' by piercing the brain through the nose. The Anzati are capable of mild telepathic control to render their victims paralyzed, and are assassins of legendary skill. The Jedi hunting mercenary Aurra Sing was trained by these assassins, as was the Jedi Master Tholme. Their planet of origin has never been verified, as all sent to investigate the planet suspected to be Anzat are never seen again. Two more famous Anzati were Dannik Jerriko, an assassin of great renown who hunted Han Solo, as written in Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina. (Dannik Jerriko appears in person and actually demonstrates killing someone in Galaxy of Fear: Ghost of the Jedi) and the dark Jedi Nikkos Tyris. Aqualish The most notorious of the Aqualish, Ponda Baba, suffered a severed arm at the hands of Obi-Wan Kenobi during a fight in the Mos Eisley cantina. The species has a reputation for being nasty, crude and aggressive, and generally pursue careers as mercenaries, bounty hunters and pirates. The Aqualish are divided into three different subspecies, the Aquala, the Ualaq and the Quara; these subspecies are differentiated by their hand structure (the Aquala have large, finlike hands, while the Quara and the Ualaq possess five fingers with clawed digits) and facial appearance (the Ualaq have four eyes and bear some resemblance to Earth spiders, while the Aquala and the Quara have two eyes and more closely resemble a walrus; this can be confirmed by the fact that the Kenner action figure of Baba was called \\"Walrus Man\\"). The Aqualish hail from the planet Ando. Their home planet is almost entirely covered by water; the only hospitable land consists of a few rocky outcroppings and swamp-covered islands. Aqualish flesh does not cauterize, nor does their blood coagulate, when wounded by a lightsaber. This can be seen in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. Arcona Arcona are scaleless, reptilian humanoids. They have flat, anvil-shaped heads, with clear, marble-like eyes, and skin tone that ranges from mahogany to ebony. The native planet of the Arcona, Cona, is always hot, and has very little water. The atmosphere is filled with ammonia vapor. The Arcona's weaknesses have been exploited in the past; off-worlders used to trade water for mineral rights, but discovered their easy addiction to salt. Traders then imported large amounts of the mineral before communities outlawed the dealings. When the species has become addicted to salt, their eyes turn from green to gold. To survive an Arconan must periodically consume a substance known as dactyl. Salt increases an Arconan's need for this substance by a hundredfold. A well known Arcona was the Jedi Knight Izal Waz (Troy Denning's Star Wars: The New Jedi Order - Star By Star). Argazdan Argazdans were a green-skinned humanoid species native to the planet Argazda. One individual named Raygar was first featured in the Ewoks episode \\"Battle for the Sunstar\\". Aruzan Aruzans, the inhabitants of Aruza, are humanoids with faintly blue skin and dark, nearly black hair. They have the ability to share their memories and emotions with one another by means of cybernetic implantsStar Wars: Tales of the Bounty Hunters During the time of Imperial subjugation, the Aruzans hired Dengar to assassinate General Kritkeen, who was the planetary commander.Tales of the Bounty Hunters, Payback: The Tale of Dengar Askajian These near-human aliens appear to be bulky, flabby creatures and are often dismissed as such. The bulk is actually stored water, a genetic trait acquired from evolving on a desert planet. When needed, the Askajian can draw on this water to survive, in which case they become dramatically thinner as the stored water is used up. Askajian tend to have multiple children per pregnancy, and thus as an evolutionary trait females of the species have three sets of breasts. Jabba had an Askajian dancer in his palace on Tattooine, whom he kept at near-maximum water weight as he found her bulk attractive. Azumel Azumels are a species of gray, mottled brown, or tan colored skin that had six eyestalks. They made an appearance in Solo: A Star Wars Story. Balosar Balosars are a sentient humanoid species from the world Basolar, which is a ruined planet, located in the Core Worlds section of the galaxy. Balosars appear to be sickly compared to common galactic species due to the heavy pollution of the Balosar homeworld. Balosars commonly are labeled as depressed, weak-willed, sarcastic, and cynical. The Balosar Elan Sleazebaggano appears in Episode II Attack of the Clones. He approaches Obi Wan, and asks Obi Wan if he would like to buy some deathsticks. Obi Wan quickly turns him away using a Jedi mind trick, convincing him to rethink his life. The Balosar species are resistant to balo mushroom extract, also known as death sticks. Bando Gora Shown in the game Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, the Bando Gora are the Star Wars version of the living dead. These souls of ancient warriors were brought back by the dark Jedi Komari Vosa. They are found all over the galaxy, but originated on one of the moons of Bogden. These beings appear as dark, humanoid creatures, wrapped in black. They answer only to their master. The Bando Gora were the personal army of Vosa, and she used them in crippling attacks on some of the galaxy's top industries. In the end, the Bando Gora, along with Vosa, were destroyed by Jango Fett. Fett was secretly hired by Count Dooku to kill Vosa and the Bando Gora. Dooku wanted to test Fett to see if he had the high ability needed to be the template for the Republic clone army. Although Vosa died, the Bando Gora did not die with her. Whoever does the proper sacrifice on the moon of Bogden will gain control of what's left of the Bando Gora. Barabel The Barabel are a reptilian species that appears human, save for the scales covering their bodies and long tails. They are extremely strong and have long pointed teeth. They are one of the most feared aliens in the Star Wars Galaxy. They will eat almost any kind of meat providing it is or was recently alive. They take great thrill in hunting for their food. However, they show an immense amount of respect to the Jedi, and seem to value their wisdom above all else. This is because in their distant history, a wandering Jedi had settled a bloody dispute between two major clans over prime hunting grounds. A trio of Barabels accompanied Anakin Solo and a handful of other young Jedi, on a mission to destroy the \\"Queen\\" voxyn on a Yuuzhan Vong planet in Denning's Star by Star. Two of the Barabel on the mission perished, as did Anakin Solo. Two of the most famous Barabels are Saba Sebatyne and her son Tesar Sebatyne. The Barabel were well known for their aggressiveness, and for never apologizing. Apologizing was an unknown concept for the Barabel, and being apologized to was considered mildly insulting by the Barabel. Apologizing to a Barabel usually made the situation worse. Besalisk Dexter Jettster, a Besalisk Besalisks are a race of four- armed humanoids from the icy planet of Ojom, though female Besalisks can have up to eight arms. Besalisks evolved from large flightless avians, though they are often mistaken for a reptilian species. They are bulky, fleshy beings able to survive for long periods without food or water. They tend to have a bony crest surrounded by short feathers, and a wide mouth with an elastic sack dangling from it. Because of their size, they are often seen as gluttonous, though this is a misconception. Another misconception is that they are nervous or in poor shape because they sweat profusely, though this is in fact due to the normally freezing temperatures on their home planet. The average Besalisk stands approximately 1.8 meters tall. Their language consists of grunts, growls, and barks, and their written language has a simple alphabet and short words, although Besalisks can speak Galactic Basic with ease. Although Besalisks have contributed very little to the galaxy in terms of resources and technology, they are sociable, gregarious, and keen-witted, are found easily in the galactic community and can readily use what other species have to offer. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, Besalisks narrowly avoided slavery by calling in favors with various influential underworld connections. Many are still working off their freedom, especially besalisks that were foolish or desperate enough to seek aid from the Hutts. Besalisks have never sought official representation in the Galactic Senate and generally seem content to go about their business and leave Galactic affairs to politicians and bureaucrats of other species. Communities on their homeworld are sparsely populated, and few offworld colonies of Besalisks are found in any era. One Besalisk, Dexter Jettster, a good friend of Obi-Wan Kenobi, is seen in Attack of the Clones. Besalisk Jedi Master Pong Krell served during the Clone Wars. In combat, he would take advantage of his six-limbed anatomy by wielding two double-bladed lightsabers, often to devastating effect. Bith Fans pose with Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes at Disney Weekend Bith are native to the planet Clak'Dor VII. They have pale skin, large heads and eyes, and long fingers. Their mouths are hidden within three folds of moist skin, and their ears are capable of hearing frequencies far beyond those that most species can perceive. In some cases, Bith have been known to hear high-powered communication broadcast signals without using artificial equipment. Due to their highly tuned audio senses, Bith are often sought after as musicians across the galaxy. They also have great reputations as starship mechanics and scientists. Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes are a Bith band seen playing music in the Mos Eisley Cantina. Bith are also able to store large amounts of information in a very short period of time and retain that information in an undamaged binary state for short periods of time. They are considered mature at ten years of age and are known for long life. In Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, Mira explains not to use a sonic grenade, as Bith have particularly sensitive hearing, a sonic grenade would normally stun other races but would \\"cause a Bith's head to pop like a melon\\". Darth Plagueis' master, Darth Tenebrous, was a Bith. Darth Tenebrous's other apprentice, Darth Venamis, was also a Bith. NASA published a photograph from the New Horizons satellite of an icy mountain formation on Pluto that looks very much like the face of a Bith from Star Wars. This is most likely a very similar situation to the face on Mars, which was a result of camera angle and unique lighting from the Sun. Blarina The Blarina are an alien race introduced in the 2015 novelization of Star Wars: The Force Awakens by Alan Dean Foster. In the novel, X-wing fighter pilot Poe Dameron, stranded on the desert planet Jakku, is aided by the Blarina scavenger Naka Iit. Naka is described as being humanoid but scaly, a little more than half the height of a human, with a short, wide snout and gold-hued, slitted eyes. He has claws and sharp teeth, and more teeth than humans have. Poe notes that the Blarina are \\"not especially strong, but ... very, very quick\\". Naka also mentions a Blarina merchant named Ohn Gos in the Jakku settlement of Blowback Town. Blood Carver Blood Carvers are thin humanoids, golden in skin color, with three jointed arms and legs. Their nose is two separate flaps that contain both the senses of smell and of hearing. Their society hates the idea of wealth and money and sees little to no use for it, basing their hierarchy on honor rather than money. Boltrunian Boltrunians are a large and muscular reptilian near-human species with hairless heads, craggy faces, wide noses, and heavy brow ridges. Boltrunians could live to be over 700 years old. Well-known Boltrunians included Warto and the Dark Jedi Maw. Often, a Boltrunian would be mistaken for a Trandoshan. B'omarr monks The B'omarr are not actually a species; rather they were an order of monks whose monastery eventually became Jabba's Palace. They believe that cutting themselves off from civilization and all corporeal distractions leads to enlightenment and to that end undergo surgery to separate their brains from their bodies and continue their existence as a brain in a jar. They learn to communicate telepathically and by controlling technology attuned to their abilities. On the rare occasions when they need to move, they are able to use a spider-like walking apparatus. The B'omarr were still in Jabba's Palace at the time it appears in Return of the Jedi, and indeed, as C-3PO enters Jabba's palace, a spiderwalker can be seen. The monks inhabit the lower part of the palace and allow the various smugglers and crime lords like Jabba to use the upper levels, as long as they add another section to the lower levels for use by the B'omarr. When the current ruler of the upper levels is deposed they drive out the stragglers and add the brains of those who do not leave to their order. The infamous Bib Fortuna himself eventually (unwillingly) became a monk, as he had sought power through the monks' teachings.Shayne, Bell M., Of the Day's Annoyances: Bib Fortuna's Tale, Tales From Jabba's Palace The animated film \\"The Clone Wars\\" establishes that the B'omarr order maintained monasteries on several planets. The facility on Teth, built on the top of a steep mountain, served as the hideout for Separatist forces who kidnapped Jabba the Hutt's son Rotta. The architecture was very similar to Jabba's palace. According to dialogue in the film, many of the abandoned monasteries are used as hideouts for smugglers. Bothan Bothans hail from the industrial Mid Rim planet of Bothawui, though they also populate various colony worlds like Kothlis and Torolis. Most Bothans stand about 5‚Äì6 ft. tall. They have tapered pointed ears, elongated heads, and a very few from both sexes have beards. They are manipulative, crafty, suspicious, curious by nature, loyal, brave, and very smart. They developed their technology to travel among the stars millennia ago and are longstanding members of the galactic civilization. The Bothans, in the galactic war, play the role of spies from the Rebel Alliance. To the Bothans, information is the galaxy's most valuable currency, as well as its most potent weapon. As a culture, they believe that direct confrontation with foes ‚Äî whether economic, political, or martial ‚Äî is pointless. In an open conflict, the object both sides desire is often damaged or destroyed. This attitude has made espionage a natural line of work for Bothans. Information and spies are their greatest exports. The famed Bothan spynet is the largest independent intelligence- gathering organization the galaxy has ever known. Beings of power everywhere find Bothans irritating because they have a tendency to use every bit of information they can to acquire leverage or money, but no one wants to be the only person without access to the spynet, so everyone continues to deal with the Bothans. The most renowned Bothans from Chaos Squadron are Jorec Thebe, Giddic Ryne and Relluf Xander, the three surviving Bothans who provided the Death Star plans in Return of the Jedi. Another Bothan is Borsk Fey'la, who later became leader of the New Republic and sacrificed himself during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion Bouncer Bouncers are furry green floating orbs with thin black tails that live on the planet Ruusan. They also appear in the novels and audio dramatizations of Star Wars: Dark Forces upon the planet Sulon. Morgan Katarn, father of soon-to-be Jedi Master Kyle Katarn, discovers the creatures in the Valley of the Jedi in Ruusan, naming them appropriately. Bouncers apparently move with the wind, lifting flaps of skin to use them as sails to guide their bodies. They use rocks and other formations to bounce them high, gliding them through the air for travel. Bouncers are said to be attuned with the Force and can communicate with those who can manipulate it. They can also become hostile when exposed to massive amounts of energy from the dark side of the Force, such as Lord Kaan's thought bomb. They communicate with other species by speaking into their minds. They can attempt to predict the future. Caamasi The Caamasi are a species of golden-furred humanoids known for their calm wisdom and pacifist nature. Strongly loyal to the Old Republic, many Caamasi died when their homeworld of Caamas was devastated by the Galactic Empire. Cathar The Cathar are cat-like humanoids from the planet Cathar. Famous Cathar are the Jedi Juhani and Crado and Sylvar, pupils of the ancient Jedi Master Vodo Siosk-Baas. The party member character Juhani from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic belongs to the Cathar race (though she's actually part of a subspecies of the Cathar that was notable for appearing less catlike than the baseline Cathar species). Aric Jorgan a companion character to the Trooper class in the MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic is also a member of the Cathar species. This race is also now playable in game. Celegian The Celegians are a species of intelligent scyphozoans native to Celegia, appearing as floating brains trailing a cluster of prehensile tentacles. The species are renowned for their wisdom and intellect, and they often travel far seeking to expand their knowledge. Celegians evolved from ocean-dwelling ancestors, and developed a natural form of levitation similar to an organic repulsorlift generator. Their homeworld has a cyanogen atmosphere, which is lethal to most species but necessary for the Celegains, for whom oxygen is toxic. Because of this, when they travel offworld, they are normally encased in a chamber filled with cyanogen; this causes them appear as if afloat in a watery brine. Because of their fragile form and life support requirements, they are rarely encountered. Cerean Cereans are a species with long cone-like heads (because they have an extra heart on top of their brain) that hail from the planet Cerea. One example is Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi. They have a very low number of males compared to females, therefore Master Mundi was allowed to have one bond wife (Shea) and several honour wives even though he was a Jedi. Cereans sport binary brains within their large heads, and although their coordination is generally somewhat impaired relative to humans or other species, they make up for it with incredible mind control and thought processes. Chadra-Fan The Chadra- Fan are short, furry mammalianoids with bat-like faces and flap-like ears. They live in the swamps and marshes of their native planet Chad. They are renowned for their weak strength, emphasized by the saying 'You punch like a Chadra-Fan.' A famous Chadra-Fan was Tekli of the New Jedi Order, who later became a healer for the Jedi. Her race was often received well because they had what many Star Wars authors referred to as adorable features. Chalactan The Chalactan was a near-human race native to Chalacta. One example is Depa Billaba. Chagrian Chagrians are blue skinned humanoids with horns and lethorns. One example is Mas Amedda, who is the Speaker of the Galactic Senate. The Chagrian homeworld's twin suns produce vast amounts of radiation that would kill a normal human. Chagrians evolved their blue skins to filter the radiation. Chiss In the Star Wars universe, the Chiss are a humanoid species with pale blue skin, blue-black hair, and glowing red eyes. First introduced to the Star Wars expanded universe in Timothy Zahn‚Äôs Thrawn Trilogy through his arch villain Grand Admiral Thrawn, the Chiss have since developed into a popular species amongst fans and other Expanded Universe authors. Another notable Chiss was Sev'rance Tann, a Dark Acolyte serving Count Dooku and a general in the Armed Forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems (believed to have actually preceded General Grievous as Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies). In the Expanded Universe, Csilla is identified as the homeworld of the Chiss. Csilla is a cold world of glaciers and snowy wastes located deep within Chiss Space, and serves as the capital of the Chiss Empire. The Chiss are noted for their lack of droids, or any kind of artificial intelligence. Baron Soontir Fel attempted to change this during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, by introducing self-thinking spacecraft. Any progress on this is more or less unknown. While their history has been marked by nearly continual warfare and conquest of other worlds, the Chiss are generally not personally violent: indeed, one of the major laws of their society (the breaking of which resulted in Thrawn's exile from their space) is that the Chiss cannot launch preemptive attacks, even against obvious aggressors. Chiss are a playable species in Star Wars the Old Republic. Noted for their typical alliance to the Empire, they can initially be Agents or Bounty Hunters and unlocked to be played as a Republic class. They are primarily Imperial Agents as in game characters and stationed on the ice planets of Hoth and Illum. Chistori The Chistori are a lizard-type humanoid race. They resemble bipedal lizards with a prominent muzzle, an impressive line of teeth, and thick scales. Few things are known in connection with the reptilians known as the Chistori because they are a secretive race. Even the Jedi Files do not know their native world. Due to their reptilian nature, they are cold blooded. If a Chistori is exposed to cold temperatures for a prolonged period of time they will undoubtedly die. One example of a Chistori would be Desann. Clawdite Clawdites are a genetic offspring of the Zolanders, the dominant species on planet Zolan. When the Zolanders discovered that their Moon had increased its radioactive emissions, they tried to unleash a gene in the Clawdites skin cells to activate natural protection against radiation. The results created a new species, Clawdites, which were metamorphs. Clawdites can change their appearance, if keeping body mass as a constant and not retaining the same aspect for a long time. Zolanders ostracized Clawdites and they had many civil wars, but in the end, Clawdites subjugated Zolanders. The Clawdites then joined the Sith Empire as part of the Storm Trooper Army, a group of Clawdites with advanced shapeshifting skills. Zam Wessel, the bounty hunter working with Jango Fett on Coruscant in Episode II: Attack of the Clones, is the most famous example of a Clawdite in Star Wars. Clawdites are also referred to as Changelings, obviously because of their ability to shape-shift. Codru-Ji Codru-Ji are four-armed humanoids with pointed ears who, while not xenophobic in the typical sense, have not yet integrated themselves into galactic society. They guard their society and their young with equal ferocity, which can be surprising since an immature Codru-Ji appears almost nothing like a mature Codru-Ji, and in fact can be mistaken for a pet. Immature Codru-Ji, also known as Wyrwulf, are small, six-limbed lupine creatures who enter a chrysalis phase in puberty and emerge a mature Codru-Ji. Coway The Coway appear in the 1978 novel Splinter of the Mind's Eye, by Alan Dean Foster. The Coway are a fur-covered humanoid species that are native to the planet Mimban, of the Circarpous Major system. Coways live deep underground, and have a strong aversion to surface-dwellers. Coways have small eyes, but are able to see in the dark due to their infrared vision. Additionally, they are able to eat foods normally poisonous to humans because of their more tolerant digestive system. They wear simple, primitive clothing. The underground world of the Coway can be reached through deep shafts known as Thrella Shafts (named after the Thrella, an extinct species known for their numerous tunnels and wells). Often these have side-tunnels that lead to Coway dwellings. The tribal government of the Coway consists of a triumvirate who make the major decisions for the tribe. Dashade In the new Jedi Order books the Dashade people are almost exterminated by the Yuuzhan Vong; but Anakin Solo steps in, and saves one particular tribe before beginning a terrible journey back to the main settlement whilst being pursued by Yuuzhan Vong warriors. Another famous Dashade is Khem Val, a companion character for the Sith Inquisitor in Star Wars: The Old Republic. Dathomirian Dathomirians are humanoid beings who reside on the planet Dathomir; the females of the species have been seen in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. The female Dathomirians are all members of the Nightsister Clan, a group that employs various powers derived from the dark side of the Force. The Nightsisters control the force through the use of spells. They also rule over the Nightbrothers, a group of Zabrak whom they employ as assassins and mates. The clan was largely wiped out by the Separatists on the orders of the Sith due to their previous attempts on the life of Count Dooku. Notable Dathomirians include Darth Maul, Asajj Ventress, Savage Opress and Mother Talzin. In Star Wars Legends, Dathomirians are depicted as a group of humans exiled to the planet Dathomir. the people settled into clans with the force-sensitive females on top. some females turned to the dark side and created a group called the nightsisters. Defel A noted Defel representative of the Star Wars films is Arleil Schous, seen with glowing red eyes in the Mos Eisley cantina of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. Devaronian Devaronians were one of the first species in the galaxy to develop interstellar travel, and the males of the species have been common sights in spaceports throughout the galaxy for thousands of years. A distinguishing physical feature of Devaronians are the devil-like horns emerging from the tops of their heads. Devaronian males are driven by an urge to wander, usually taking the first opportunity to move on from one place to another. As such, they are often found traveling the galaxy as tramp freighter captains and scouts. Female Devaronians, on the other hand, are content to remain in a single location, and, as such, raise the young and run the government of Devaron. The males send as much money as they can manage back to their home world to support their families, but otherwise hardly ever return once they have begun to travel the stars. The females are content with this arrangement, as they tend to view the restless males as disruptive to home life. One Devaronian, Kardue'sai'Malloc, going by the name of Labria, was seen in the cantina scene of A New Hope. He had one of the galaxy's highest bounties posted by the Rebel Alliance for his war crimes at the Devaronian city of Montellian Serat, and was eventually captured by Boba Fett. Unlike most Devaronian males, Labria had a rare mutation that gave him two sets of teeth, a normal male set and a female set that he could retract at will. Such mutants were prized as scouts, as they could travel afar and survive on food normally inedible to males. Dowutin Dowutins are an alien species featured in legends and other films. They have horns on their chins and have hooved feet. They are usually very large. Examples include: Grummgar the Hunter, who is seen in Maz Kanata‚Äôs castle in The Force Awakens, and the Ninth Sister, who is an Inquisitor featured in Star Wars comics. Drach'nam Drach'nam appear in the short story \\"Jade Solitare\\" in the compilation Tales of The New Republic. They are a very brutal and violent race employing neuronic whips (a whip with a conductive lash which sends hundreds of volts through the victim's body), and long (15\\") serrated knives. Their home planet is very diverse on the surface ranging from very hot to extremely cold. The planet rotates extremely slowly - one day is about two hundred earth years - so as a result all of the Drach'nam cities are dark and dank tunnels. The only famous Drach'nam is Chay Praysh, who is famous for employing female slaves in his palace (Mara Jade once became a slave to his brutal regime to rescue Ja Bardrins daughter Sansia). Dressellian Dressellians are wrinkled humanoids from the planet Dressel. Dressellians believe fiercely in an individuals freedom and will often find it difficult to work in groups, even so many formed a freedom fighting force during the time of the Empire to fight for their right to live as they wanted.Ann Margaret Lewis. The Essential Guide to Alien Species. Del Rey, 2001. Dresselians treasure freedom above everything else. Dressellians use slugthrowers (rifles and pistols firing metal projectiles) instead of blasters. Several Dressellians appear briefly on screen in Return of the Jedi, attending the Rebel Alliance meeting on board the Home One star cruiser, just prior to the Battle of Endor. An action figure of a Dressellian dubbed \\"Prune Face\\" was produced for Kenner's Star Wars action figure line in 1984. Droch Source of the mysterious Death Seed plague, the drochs are an insect race from Nam Chorios that start off life as non-sentient but can become sentient by absorbing the life of victims. A droch can burrow under the skin of its intended victim and drink their life while they sleep, or sometimes while they are awake. Their small size, great agility and fast reproductive cycle means that they can wipe out the population of a city in a matter of only a few days. As the drochs drink of sentient victim's life, they also absorb intelligence. Larger, \\"captain drochs\\" can absorb life through the smaller drochs without having to come into contact with the victims themselves. One mutated captain droch, named Dzym, lived to be 250 years old and grew to human size, able to disguise himself as a human and gaining sentience from absorbing intelligence for all that time. Drovian Drovians are a tall and burly species from Nim Drovis with thick trunk-like legs that, like their arms, end in three sharp pincers. The Drovians divided into two tribes, the Gopso'o and the Drovians, centuries ago, and have been at war with each other since. Nearly all Drovians are addicted to a narcotic called zwil; originally imported as a cake flavoring, the Drovians can absorb it directly into their systems through their breathing tubes. Dug Dugs are shown in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter as an enemy on the planet Malastare. Dugs have been known to be greedy, and are most of the time looking for a deal on any product. In Attack of the Clones a Dug is seen in one of the airspeeders during the speeder chase sequence (many fans believe that is Sebulba once again since Anakin cut him off which is similar to the events in the Boonta Eve Classic), and another is seen in Dexter's diner. Dulok Duloks were a green-colored furry species of Endor and are biologically related to Ewoks, though they tend to act more like Tusken Raiders of Tatooine. They first appeared in the Ewoks series, and one makes an appearance on Coruscant in Clone Wars. Durkii Durkii are a purple dinosaur-like species. Duros Duros are hairless beings with blue skin and large red eyes, said to be among the first spacefaring humanoid species, including humans. They are known for their superior astronavigational skills. Their homeworld is Duro, which is in the galactic core. Two Duros can be seen in the Mos Eisley Cantina in the 1977 film Star Wars. Cad Bane, a Duro on the Cartoon Network show The Clone Wars is a professional bounty hunter. Duros have also appeared in a few Star Wars games, including Knights of the Old Republic and Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords. The Duros have not set foot on their world since the Empire polluted it with weapons factories. Instead they live in large orbital cities surrounding the planet. Duros are related to the Neimoidians, the aliens in charge of the Trade Federation in the prequel films, because many years before the Republic, the Duros colonized the planet Neimoidia, and thus the Neimoidians, a newer \\"version\\" of Duros, were born. Ironically the two races differed in temperament: Duros were normally seen as adventurous, while Neimoidians were mostly skittish. The Duros consider the Neimoidians to be cowardly and take offense at being mistaken by other beings for a Neimoidian. Duros are also known for their great story-telling skills because of the many places that they have visited during their travels throughout the galaxy: their preferred form of address is \\"Traveller\\", as shown in The Paradise Snare. Their planet was remade by the Yuuzhan Vong during the war into a bio- shipyard for the Vong's living creations.Carey, Craig R., Chris Doyle, Jason Fry, Paul Sudlow, John Terra, and Daniel Wallace. Coruscant and the Core Worlds. Wizards of the Coast, 2003. Echani The Echani are a mysterious race of well taught fighters, whose most prominent appearance was in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords. Five Echani Handmaiden sisters reside with Jedi Master Atris at her academy at the polar ice cap on Telos. These Echani were trained by Atris to construct barriers in their minds in order to resist Force-based powers. The Echani race possess natural martial art skill and wear light armour in battle, although they prefer to wear very little when training to restrict their movements less. The Echani maidens were often used to hunt down rogue Jedi and subdue them for the Order. Human in appearance, they often have leucystic skin and hair and closely resemble their parents, and therefore their siblings. As long as they have the same parents, Echani siblings are identical in appearance. The best known of the Echani in the Star Wars universe was Brianna, the last of Atris' Handmaidens. She served with her Mistress on Telos until the Jedi Exile arrived. After speaking with the Exile, she stowed away on board his ship, the Ebon Hawk. Eventually, it is revealed that her mother was a Jedi Knight and she herself starts on the path of the Jedi. This fact is the reason that Brianna looks different from her sisters - she does not share the same mother. This story depended on the player of the game choosing a male character. If the player chose a female character, the above story would not occur as so. It is known that the Echani held a traditional rivalry with the Mandalorians. Echani and Mandalorians both saw each other as worthy opponents, therefore causing a war between them to prove whose skills were the better. Due to the combat training of the Echani on a daily level, their bones become tougher, making them more durable. A version of the Echani style of unarmed combat is taught to members of Palpatine's Imperial Guard and Sith guard. This style has been adapted to be more brutal and efficient and less flashy. Echani were often seen on snowy/cold planets such as Hoth and Eshan. They made their bases underground since they would have been made out of durable materials. Though not much is known about their aging process it is presumed that they age at the same rate of a human and their life expectancy is around one hundred years. Elomin The Elomin are tall, demon-like thin humanoids with pointed ears and four horns. They live on the surface of the planet Elom. As a society, the Elomin strove to find order in all things, and worked to create order where it didn't exist. So when they discovered that another species, the Eloms, shared the same planet with them, most Elomin refused to acknowledge that their underground brethren even existed. Epicanthix The Epicanthix are tall, muscular, near-humans native to the planet Panatha. They were known as warriors, having conquered many bordering planets such as Bunduki. They live longer than humans, with a life-span of around 130 years. They possess a rare genetic immunity to force assisted mental tricks, influence, domination and mind reading. Although Epicanthix appeared very similar to baseline human, they were distinct enough that they could be recognized by sight, as in the case of Epicanthix Imperial Agent Ula Vii, who was so recognized by a pair of Imperials and ridiculed for his non-Human ancestry. Star Wars: The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance Er'Kit Er'Kit are usually skinny and grayish- blue, with long ears. The only well-known one is Ody Mandrell. Er'Kit inhabit the desert planet Er'Kit, for which they were named. Ewok Ewoks are a primitive tribal species from the forest moon of Endor. They are approximately half the size of humans and covered with fur. The Ewoks are best known for their aid to the Rebel mission to remove the shield protecting the Second Death Star known as the battle of Endor. While peaceful by nature, they are extremely territorial and have been known to fight ferociously in protection of their society. Though they are known as Ewoks, the species name itself was never mentioned in Return of the Jedi.

For Star Wars humans, see Star Wars humans. Star Wars is an American epic space opera film series created by George Lucas. The first film in the series, Star Wars, was released on May 25, 1977 and became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon, followed by five sequels and three prequels. Many species of alien creatures (often humanoid) are depicted. Falleen The Falleen are a race of human-like reptilian people who come from a world called Falleen in the Midrim region of the galaxy. They can change the color and hue of their skin to convey their emotional states and can also affect the emotional state of others. Males and females of the race have strong pheromones which can attract women and men respectively of many humanoid species easily. The Falleen seldom leave their world due to the belief that their species is superior to all others. A notable Legends villain from this race is Prince Xizor. Another major villain was Darth Karrid of the Old Republic. Far-Outsiders Far-Outsiders is the cryptic code-name given by the Chiss who inhabit the edges of the galaxy, for the extra-galactic alien force that began assaulting the Unknown Regions in the years during the Galactic Civil War. They are probably the Yuuzhan Vong, who launched a siege on the galaxy from 25-30 ABY (After the Battle of Yavin). The name \\"Far-Outsiders\\" is also used by the inhabitants of Zonama Sekot to describe the invaders that attacked their planet. The Far-Outsiders are referred to in the singular, but the Chiss named \\"Stent\\" once told Mara Jade that there were \\"a hundred different threats out there that would freeze your blood if you knew about them. The Ruling Families can't stop them; neither can any power in the region.\\", suggesting that the term \\"Far-Outsiders\\" may apply to any unknown hostile race originating from outside the galaxy.Vision of the Future, (Book 2 of the Hand of Thrawn duology), 1st edition, 1998. Timothy Zahn, Feeorin Nym, a pirate from various Star Wars computer games (including the MMORPG \\"Star Wars Galaxies\\") was a Feeorin. It is said that Feeorins only grow stronger with age. Their homeworld was Odryn for a period of time in the Old Republic era, when the oldest and strongest Feeorin was chosen as their leader. The controversial Jedi master Feln was a Feeorin leader.Knights of the Old Republic #29 It has been stated in several Star Wars novels and comics that there are only roughly 1 million Feeorins left in the galaxy, suggesting a decline from a larger number.Star Wars Tales #7 Ferroans Not a well known species, the only reference is in Force Heretic 1-3 and Rogue Planet. They have icy blue skin, whitish hair, and live on Zonama Sekot, a living planet. The planet provides them fleshy habitats constructed of its own mass. Firrerreo The Firrerreo are a species of near-humans from the planet Firrerre. They have two-toned hair and golden skin. In their culture, if someone says a Firrerreo's name, the Firrerreo would be forced to serve the speaker, as saying a Firrerreo's name was a form of power. They no longer live on Firrerre; after the poisoning of their world by the Empire, they were loaded onto massive colony ships for a journey to another world. One of their own, a Force-sensitive named Hethrir, betrayed his people by the command of Darth Vader. After the deaths of Darth Vader and Palpatine, Hethrir returned and intercepted the colony ships. He disengaged the drives and left the sleeping Firrerre to drift in space. He plundered the ships for the valuable equipment onboard and took the children to sell as slaves. Hethrir kidnapped the children of Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa Solo; Anakin and the twins Jacen and Jaina. Han was on a mission on the time and did not know of the kidnappings, so Princess Leia set out to find them herself. On her quest she stumbled upon the drifting colony ships. She asked one of the two awake Firrerre if he wanted to be freed, but he said that they would reengage the drive, heading towards the planet selected for them by the Emperor years before. They were considered extinct by the Yuuzhan Vong War, but, 15 years later, they were just considered scattered. Fosh The Fosh are a sentient avian species. They are first mentioned in the Star Wars: The New Jedi Order series. The only Fosh mentioned in all the Star Wars books was the Jedi Knight Vergere. The Fosh never had a large population on their planet, which prevented them from becoming an influential race as humans are in the Star Wars universe. Fosh females have preternaturally developed tear ducts, used for mating purposes on their homeworld. The Jedi Vergere, with the aid of the Force, can further alter her tears to secrete anything from an extremely potent anesthetic, to a powerful antidote such as the one that cured Mara Jade Skywalker after she was infected with a deadly Yuuzhan Vong disease.From the book Traitor by Matthew Stover (27 ABY). The only known Fosh, a female Jedi Knight named Vergere is also mentioned during Anakin Skywalker's time on Zonoma Sekot, as he recalls a flashback of her. Her call is what brought Obi-Wan and Anakin to the planet in the first place, although they can find no trace of her, and instead hear of mysterious invaders. The description of Vergere falls in line with the description of her when she returns with the Yuuzhan Vong, and is the same Vergere that disappeared from Zonoma Sekot. Frozian The Frozian are a species of sentient felines, hailing from the planet Froz. Their most distinctive characteristics are their triple-jointed hands, their double-jointed legs, and their infertility off their homeworld. Following the decimation of their planet by the Empire, the species started plummeting towards extinction. It has been rumored that underground scientists have been trying to create an artificial environment for them to save their species and allow mating to begin again. Frozarns Frozarns are pink humanoids with green eyes and tough armor. They live on Mimban. Gado Gados are tall, thin, furry sapients with long limbs and a worm-like head. Most of a Gado's inner organs are stretched out in ribbons that run throughout their body; thus, any injury can be life-threatening to a Gado. Gados are native to the planet of Abregado-rae. They formerly spoke a language called Gados, but now mostly speak Basic. Gamorrean A Gamorrean is a large pig-like creature from the fictional Star Wars series.Andy Mangels, Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Characters (Ballantine Books, 1995), 66. The creatures have little intelligence and are often hired as guards, notably by Jabba the Hutt,Don Bies, Nelson Hall, Alexander Ivanov, and David West Reynolds, Star Wars: The Visual Dictionary (DK Pub., 1998), 47. who was fond of hiring them due to their low cost. On their home planet, Gamorreans exist in a sort of tribal political system dominated by the female sows. The males train for massive tribal conflicts that take place each year. The first time a vessel landed on Gamorr, the various tribes fought for days over who would win the right to approach it. The winning side eventually battered the vessel to pieces. Entries regarding the Gamorrean homeworld in travel guides simply read \\"DO NOT GO TO GAMORR!\\"Star Wars: Essential Guide to Planets Physically, Gamorreans appear in Return of the Jedi as greenish, slimy (and apparently smelly) pig-like creatures. They are about tall and weigh about . Underneath their pig-like snouts, protruding from jowled cheeks are yellowed tusks. These complement the small, yellow horns the Gamorreans have growing from the top of their heads. Jabba the Hutt was known to use dim-witted Gamorreans as enforcers and bodyguards, while their wives and children stayed elsewhere in the palace. They can be best described closest to pigs with their mouths and grunting kind of language. These creatures have also appeared in a picture released by the author of the show The Mandalorian, Jon Favreau, to show the release of season 2 of the show coming out in fall of 2020.Eric Cagle, Michael Mikaelian, Steve Miller, and Owen K. C. Stephens, Ultimate Alien Anthology: Ultimate Alien Anthology (Wizards of the Coast, 2003), 6. Howard Stern has referred frequently to \\"Gamorrean Guard\\", a person interviewed by Gary Garver at a Star Wars convention. Gand Gands are insectoids who evolved on the planet Gand. There are two main sub-species of Gands: those with lungs, which are very rare, and those without. Gands with lungs are adapted to Gand's ammonia-rich atmosphere, but they are poisoned by oxygen and must use a special breathing apparatus if they want to leave Gand. Gands without lungs have special regeneration properties, demonstrated by their ability to recover quickly from injuries and even re-grow lost limbs (As shown by Ooryl Qrygg in the X-wing series by Michael Stackpole). Gands are not allowed to use personal pronouns unless they have achieved something extraordinary. A young or under achieving Gand talks about himself or herself in third person and calls themselves \\"Gand\\". If a Gand achieves something notable, they can use their family's surname, but will still use the third person. A second, more impressive feat allows the heroic Gand to choose a first name for himself. Only the best-known Gands are allowed to use the first person, and then only after their aptitude has been audited by a jury, in what is called a janwuine-jika, after which they are declared janwuine. However, should a Gand be ashamed of their deeds, they would \\"reduce\\" their name when talking about themselves. Many Gands choose a strange profession, the Findsman. A Findsman is a shaman as well as a police officer. The Findsman will interpret the shapes of gases and make prophecies, usually about fugitives. Then, the Findsman will track the fugitive to bring him to justice. During the reign of the Empire, some Findsmen became bounty hunters. One of the best-known Gands is Zuckuss, who was a bounty hunter employed by Darth Vader to hunt down Han Solo, and was at one time the assistant to Bossk. Another well known Gand is Ooryl Qrygg, a pilot in Rogue Squadron, and a very good friend of Corran Horn, both of whom are characters in the book I, Jedi. Ooryl lacked lungs and therefore did not need a mask for normal oxygen environments. He became so honoured among Gands that he was given the honour of referring to himself in the first person. It is apparent, based on Corran's observations, that if Ooryl was troubled or distressed he would speak in third person until the problem was solved. An example of such would be when Corran and Ooryl were in the mess hall on a Mon Calamari cruiser: Ooryl, in mid-conversation, began speaking in third person, and Corran immediately noticed something was troubling him, with the author (who narrates from Corran's point of view) noting that Ooryl only did this when something was bothering him. Gank Also known as \\"Gank Killers\\" due to their volatile nature, Ganks are a sentient cyborg species. It is a rare day that you see a Gank not wearing his body-covering armor. Many are found working for Hutts on Nar Shaddaa, but there are other Ganks living in other places besides \\"The Smuggler's Moon\\". It is also quite common for Ganks to wear armor that represents the planet they live on or the faction they fight for. They are brutal killers that will annihilate anything that gets in their way. There is a story, however, of an encounter a group of Ganks had with the Jedi Master Mace Windu. Surrounded by 14 Ganks, Master Windu simply touched his lightsaber hilt and the Ganks dropped their weapons to the ground. Gen'Dai These large humanoids are encased in heavy armor most of the time, which serves as their exoskeleton. Their nervous and circulatory systems make them extremely resilient. Their nervous system is composed of thousands of clusters allowing them to regenerate limbs and pull nearby limbs back onto their bodies. This unusual nervous system gives them Jedi-like reflexes. They also lack a central heart. They have an advanced vascular system that circulates blood. They lack vital organs making them nearly invulnerable to attack. These odd nervous and circulatory systems may be the cause of their astonishingly long lifespans. There were some Gen'Dai reported to have lived for more than 4000 years. The most well known Gen'Dai was Durge. He was one of Count Dooku's lieutenants and also one of the rare cases of \\"violent Gen'Dai\\". Durge fought and bested a young Boba Fett in combat but was later beaten on Muunilinst by Obi-Wan Kenobi, before being killed in space by Anakin Skywalker, near the end of the Clone Wars (Anakin trapped Durge in an escape pod then used the Force to guide it into a nearby star). Gerb Gerbs are a race of hunchbacked rabbit-like aliens. They live on the thirteenth moon of Yavin. Geonosian The Geonosians are an insectoid species native to the planet Geonosis, a barren rocky world that is home to thousands of factories geared towards mechanical construction. Many of the galaxy's biggest manufacturing concerns hold contracts with the Geonosians. Geonosians reside in hive colonies in organic-looking spires. George Lucas thought of the creatures as termite-like in terms of how their society formed, including their architecture. All Geonosians have a hard exoskeleton, elongated faces, multi-jointed limbs, and speak in a strange clicking language. There are two main types of Geonosian: the wingless drones that mostly work as laborers, and the winged aristocrat, which includes royal warriors serving as scouts and providing security to the hive. They look down on their wingless cousins. In Star Wars: The Clone Wars, it is revealed that the Geonosian Queen Karina the Great uses a kind of \\"brain worm\\" to ensure the loyalty of other Geonosians. This mind control exists even after the host's death, although the \\"Geonosian zombies\\" have pure white eyes. Geonosians do not have a standing military, although they do arm themselves with sonic blasters and static pikes. They instead use their droid foundries to build armies for corporate interests wealthy enough to afford them like the Trade Federation and the Techno Union. The Geonosians are also the ones who developed the Death Star plans, leading to the race being mostly enslaved under Imperial occupancy as the Death Star itself was being built. (As seen in \\"Star Wars: Empire at War\\") But as revealed in Star Wars Rebels 2-part episode \\"Ghost of Geonosis\\", the Geonosians were nearly driven to extinction by the Empire to ensure the secrecy of the Death Star as it was nearing completion and moved to an disclosed location. Only a Geonosian nicknamed \\"Klik-Klak\\" and a queen egg appear to remain on Geonosis. Poggle the Lesser was a Geonosian who appeared in Episode II and oversaw the production of battle droids for the Trade Federation and later provided the bulk of the troops for the Confederacy of Independent Systems. He was decapitated by Darth Vader on Mustafar in Episode III. In the video game Star Wars Battlefront II, the player must fight a Geonosian who is trying to use the droid factories on Mustafar to create his own army. He was named Gizor Delso. Geonosians make a unique appearance in Lego Star Wars: The Video Game, appearing with one of two weapons (either their characteristic sonic blaster or a normal blaster rifle) randomly, beyond the player's control. Givin The Givin are from the planet Yag'Dhul and are often found doing starship repair work because of their exoskeleton, which allows them to withstand depressurization; this vacuum-resistance allows them to resist many forms of deadly gases. Givin are renowned for their extensive knowledge of anything that has to do with numbers, and often are regarded as some of the best mathematicians in the galaxy. Gizka Gizka are a species of small amphibious creatures, appearing in the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Whatever their native world, their extraordinary reproduction rate led to a fair amount of Gizka on many worlds, even including uncharted planets such as Rakata Prime, finding their way from the wreckage of crashed starships. It has been alternatively postulated that they came from that planet originally, spreading along with the Infinite Empire. Their exponential population growth led to them being considered pests on almost as many worlds as they inhabited. The Ebon Hawk once played host to a temporary colony of Gizka, in an incident involving mishandled cargo, an Aqualish, and a Tatooine shipping company. To get rid of them the Gizka were given poison and when they attacked other Gizka they passed on the disease exterminating the population. (Alternatively, the gizka can be sold or given to a Selkath \\"petting zoo\\" on the water planet of Manaan.) The Gizka are a tribute to the popular Star Trek episode, \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\". Glymphid The Glymphid are a race of amphibian aliens with a rod-thin build, suction cup-tipped digits, and a long proboscis. Notable Glymphids include the podracer Aldar Beedo. Gorax The Goraxes are a race of behemoths from the forest moon of Endor. They can grow up to more than 98 feet in height and dwell on high crags far from the forests of the forest moon. They are mentioned in the Illustrated Star Wars Universe book and appear as an antagonist in the Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure movie. They are humanoid, with primate-like faces and narrow chins, as well as enormous ears which are highly sensitive to noises made by small animals. They communicate through grumbling noises. The Goraxes wear fur clothes. They are primitive and powerful and frequently make raids on Ewok villages, where they smash through walls and kidnap Ewoks for pets, although the Goraxes usually forget to feed them or crush the unfortunate Ewoks. They hunt at night, since their eyes are sensitive to bright light. The Gorax is solitary and usually doesn't run into others. The only bond it has is with its pet boar wolves. Gorith The Gorith are a tall humanoid race with a large beaked head. Their skin tone ranges from blues to greens. Their home planet is Gorithia; a mostly aquatic world. They are very independent from the rest of the universe and are not part of the Galactic Republic. Notable Gorith include Jedi Master Ottarious and his padawan Petirus Metris. Gorog The Gorog (or the 'Dark Nest') are one of the eleven hives of the Killik who are an insectoid sentient species from the Unknown Regions. They have the ability to block themselves from the force, similar to the effect of the Ysalamiri of Myrkr and are a black and blue color. The Gorog are considered 'evil' in that they feed their grubs on live captives (mainly Chiss) and have a desire for war and wish to conquer the galaxy. The Gorog are led by the two dark Jedi Welk and Lomi Plo. Non Killiks become what are known as Joiners if they spend too long with the Killik. Joiners are regular species who become one with the hive. Raynar Thul became a joiner and then the UnuThul or king of the Killiks. Lomi and Welk joined the Gorog and all of their values were passed to the Dark Nest, corrupting the Gorog. The Dark nest was able to influence UnuThul like the subconscious of a mind, into unwillingly moving into Chiss border zones and provoking a dispute. The Killik naturally did not care about life much until the Crash. The Crash was when Welk and Lomi Plo crashed on a Killik world, in a ship from Myrkr the Tachyon Flyer with their prisoner Raynar Thul, a Jedi who was involved in the attack on Myrkr. Raynar managed to use the force to make the Killik heal him but in the process, was made mostly insect and The Joiner King. The Killik share a collective mind which allow them to transmit thought between each other. So when Raynar became one of the Hive, The Jedi love of life was passed to all Killiks, causing them to value and try to preserve life. The Gorog originally were based on the moon Kr on the Chiss border and were destroyed by Mara Jade and Luke Skywalker, Han and Leia Organa Solo, a group of Jedi Masters from the Jedi academy on Ossus and a squad of specially equipped 'Bugcruncher' battle droids. Welk was killed by Luke Skywalker in the Battle of Kr. All of this occurred 7 years after the Fall of Coruscant and roughly 5 years after the Battle of Yuuzhan'Tar. The Dark nest was thought to be destroyed along with the Jedi turned-Gorog Joiner Alema Rar. But the nest and Alema survived and moved to the Tusken's Eye in the Utegetu nebula where the Killiks mostly had peace for one year. During their time in the Utegetu Nebula, the Dark Nest built a fleet of 11 armed hive ships, harboured pirates, killed Supreme Commander Sien Sovv of the Alliance, smuggled dark nest membrosia to insect worlds, framed the Jedi for a problem the Fizz on the Utegetu worlds and convinced the Killiks and UnuThul to attack the galaxy. All this was done under the command of Lomi Plo and Alema Rar, the night herald. There are other hives like the main hive Unu and the artistic hive Saras. Gossam The Gossam are a humanoid race with long necks from the planet Castell. The Commerce Guild, which was a major contributor to the droid armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, is based on Castell. Notable Gossam include Shu Mai, the President of the Commerce Guild. Gotal Gotals evolved in dark Antar 4. As light is not available there, they evolved cranial cones, receptors to electromagnetism and other emissions. They do not rely on sight, but they can be great trackers thanks to their cones. However, natural emissions from a droid or a Jedi do damage Gotals. Culturally, they only seem to be attracted to other creatures with cones or horns. This has led to many unfortunate deaths as many male Gotals will be attracted to females of the H'nemethe species who tend to disembowel their mates. Gran The Gran (also known as Kinyenians) are a three-eyed alien race, 1.5 to 1.8 meters in height. They are native to the planet Kinyen, though they have colonies across the galaxy, such as on the planets Hok and Malastare. They are characterized by three eyes on stalks, a protruding, goat-like mouth, and orange skin. Gran had a great deal of power within the Galactic Senate, during the later years of the Old Republic. However, by the time the Emperor's reign descended over the galaxy Gran became less prominent, and suffered from Imperial oppression. A representative of this species is Maks Leem, a Jedi from the Old Republic, who was murdered by Asajj Ventress. Other notable Gran include Plat Mallar and Ree-Yees. In the series Star Wars: The Clone Wars two senators, Senator Kharrus and Senator Philo make one-episode appearances. They're both killed. Kharrus died in a shuttle crash, and Philo was shot in the back by Cad Bane. In the Expanded Universe, most notably in the video games, Grans have become one of the most prominent enemies the player has to face, which is seen in the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight games. Gree The Gree were a six-tentacled race of cephalopod creatures that had an unusual anatomy with gray skin, large sad-looking eyes along with tall foreheads. These features supported an immense brain sac which flopped oddly behind their heads. Grizmallt The Grizmallt are the original settlers of Naboo. The Naboo's history begins about 3950 BBY on the planet Grizmallt with the rise of Queen Elsinor den Tasia. To begin her reign, Tasia introduced a new age of exploration and colonization. Under her rule, Grizmallt spent the next several decades launching hundreds of expeditions into the wilds of space. Most of these missions failed, the colony ships destroyed or lost as they searched for habitable worlds far beyond the known hyperlanes. In the final days of her life, Queen Tasia personally sponsored the last such expedition. With the blessing of a famous Jedi Master, the colony ship Beneficent Tasia and its support starships, Constant and Mother Vima, left Grizmallt in search of fortune and glory. The expedition targeted the galaxy's dangerous southern quadrant, then home to a handful of settlements. On Grizmallt, Queen Tasia's dying wish was that this last expedition would find a home deep within unexplored space. Shortly after she perished, however, the Beneficent Tasia also went silent. The inhabitants of Grizmallt assumed that Beneficent Tasia had been lost, but the starship did, in fact, survive the many hazards of unknown space. Although severely damaged and unable to contact Grizmallt, the expedition eventually reached Naboo's orbit. As if guided by Tasia's last wish, the settlers discovered that Naboo was a pastoral, peaceful world rich in natural resources and quite capable of supporting human life. In approximately 3900 BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin), the Grizmallt colonists crash landed on Naboo to stay. Within weeks of their arrival, the settlers encountered the Gungans, the planet's native sentient species. Although immediately distrustful of one another, neither species attacked the other and the humans were allowed to establish their first settlement without incident. Over the next several decades, the settlers slowly spread across the planet's largest landmass, building cities and villages to support their growing numbers. The human colonists kept to the grassy plains and ocean coastlines, only occasionally treading into Gungan territory. Despite this, tension between the humans and the Gungans remained strong. Gungans named the human settlers as \\"Naboo\\" , the Gungan word for \\"foolish\\" or \\"plainsfolk\\" as the humans settled on the dry grassy northern plains of the planet which the indigenous Gungans considered foolish, being undesirably dry and hostile to their way of life. The amphibious Gungans dwell in the southern wet swamplands, lakes and seas of the planet.\\"The Secrets Of Naboo\\" RPG Book, by Steve Miller & JD Wiker. Published by Wizards Of The Coast & Lucas Books. Grysk / Yuuzhan Vong Initially introduced as the Yuuzhan Vong in the book series The New Jedi Order (1999‚Äì2003), the species were an extragalactic, technophobic, fanatically religious species who were intent upon conquering the galaxy, which they attempted during the Yuuzhan Vong War (25‚Äì29 ABY). They were both invisible to direct Force sight and unaffected by direct Force powers. The Yuuzhan Vong used biotechnology instead of mechanical technology. Their homeworld was at first in a different galaxy and was called Yuuzhan'tar, which was destroyed in the Cremlevian War. Some went to a seed that was produced from the ashes of Yuuzhan'Tar which was first seen by people in the Unknown Regions and was called Zonama Sekot. Others went to Coruscant, which they renamed Yuuzhan'tar upon conquering the planet in 27 ABY, ending the New Republic. The Yuuzhan Vong believed that all other races were little more than barbarians who were not fit to live in their presence. Because of this the Vong attempted to conquer the universe with little thought to the damage they were doing to the universe or its inhabitants. The only race the Vong saw as a threat, or as close to a threat as they were willing to believe, were Wookiees. They saw them as fierce warriors and felt that they deserved to live. For this reason, the Vong enslaved Wookiees rather than attempting to destroy them. After the fall of Coruscant, the scattered New Republic's troops reorganised and joined forces with the Imperial Remnant (established in 12 ABY) to form the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances (or simply Galactic Alliance) in 28 ABY, which managed to defeat the Yuuzhan Vong and drive them back to the Unknown Regions in 29 ABY. ;Canon After the October 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by Disney, the Yuuzhan Vong were declared non-canonical in April 2014. In their stead, the film Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) introduced the First Order, a faction that arose from one of many Imperial Remnants between 5 and 21 ABY, and eventually destroyed the New Republic in 34 ABY, while the Resistance (formed in 28 ABY) continued to fight against the First Order. A canonical version of the Yuuzhan Vong, now known as the Grysk, were introduced in the Timothy Zahn novel Thrawn: Alliances (2018). Both species are described as having sloping foreheads and skull-like faces, and being a threat to the Chiss Ascendancy hailing from the Unknown Regions and enslaving other races, though the Grysk use conventional mechanical technology rather than biotechnology, as the novel is set in an earlier time frame than the previous non-canonical Legends novels. Gungan The Gungans, also known as Goongas, have humanoid amphibious bodies, but their heads are elongated with large, dangling fin-like ears. They are amphibian in blood and seem to have evolved from frogs and toads, given their incredible jumping. They live in underwater cities on the planet Naboo. The principal Gungan character in the movies is Jar Jar Binks; the ruler of the Gungans is Boss Nass. Boss Nass is an Ankura, a subspecies of Gungan. The only other Gungans to be given a name in the films are Captain Tarpals, and Augara Jowil, though the novelization also mentions a General Ceel and The Yellow Dart. Other games have shown other leaders including Boss Gallo. The Gungans and the Naboo (human inhabitants of Naboo) did not get along, as the Gungans believed the Naboo to be pompous cowards, while the Naboo believed the Gungans to be barbarians. This attitude lasted until Queen Amidala united the Gungans and Naboo to fight the Trade Federation in the Battle of Naboo. After the Battle of Naboo, the Gungans attained representation in the Senate through Representative Jar Jar Binks, who became very close friends with Senator Padm√© Amidala. The Gungans reproduce sexually; although they seem androgynous, the males tend to be taller and more muscular than the females, who usually tie their long ears back. Gwurran The Gwurran of Ansion look like the native Ansionians, only smaller. They are hyperactive, inquisitive beings who live primitively off the land and who steal the food of travellers passing through the hills. The Gwurran deeply hate their taller rural brethren, the Alwari, who consider them to be backward. Habassa The Habassa are mentioned only in the X-wing computer game. They originate from the planet Habassa II which was enslaved by the Empire. After the Battle of Yavin, they joined the Alliance. Hallotan The Hallotans are scaly creatures who are native to the planet Muskree. They have turned Muskree into an industrial planet and are immune to the pollutions they have created. Hapan The Hapans are the people of the Hapes Cluster and the Hapes Consortium. The Hapes Cluster is very bright, so Hapans' vision at night is not as good as other humans. Though similar to humans, they are known for being beautiful, especially the women. The women are also the dominant sex. Hapans speak the Hapan language. Harch The Harch were sentient spider-like species from Secundus Ando. Admiral Trench of the Star Wars: the Clone Wars series is of this race. Herglic Herglics were a cetacean-like species similar to whaladons. They originated from Giju. Himoran The Himorans share an ancient lineage with Bothans, thus are similar in appearance, though significantly taller. Hailing from the massive planet Himora, these sentients are a primitive people, their homeworld having been long neglected by larger existing governments. Himorans are exceptional in that their population contains an unusually large number of Force-sensitive individuals, expected to number more than 7000. H'nemthean H'nemtheans are reptilian humanoids, from the planet H'nemthe, have four conelets and double cheekbones, resulting in ridges of bone and skin on their faces. The hornlets are sensitive to both emotion and temperature. When a female H'nemthe consummates her relationship with a male, she eviscerates him with her knife-shaped tongue, strangely considering it a proof of love. This odd ritual is most likely a result of the fact that there are 20 males to every female on their home planet.From the story \\"Nightlily: The Lovers' Tale\\" by Barbara Hambly, in the collection Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina. Hoojib The Hoojibs are small furry telepathic creatures that are indigenous to Arbra. The Hoojibs allowed the Rebel Alliance to use their planet as a temporary headquarters following the Battle of Hoth. One of the best-known Hoojibs is Plif, who accompanied Luke Skywalker on several missions. Plif later became a New Republic senator. Huk The Huk were a race of aliens hailing from the planet of the same name. They are an insectoid species and resemble Geonosians. Their planet was in a constant war with the Kaleesh people of the neighboring planet, Kalee, for many years prior to the Clone Wars and the Great Jedi Purge. The Galactic Republic aided the Huk in their war against the Kaleesh, though this still did not garner enough sympathy for the Separatists to convince General Grievous to join their cause. Hssiss Hssiss were large dragon like creatures that appeared on Korriban. Members of this species are shrouded with the dark side and feature large armor plating on the dorsal region. These creatures have a strong connection with the force and an ability to become invisible. In the Xbox game \\"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II ‚Äì The Sith Lords\\", they guarded the skeletal remains of what was left of the old Sith Academy. If you choose to search the remains of a Sith, Hssiss would come out of nowhere and attack you. They are formidable and are immune to certain force powers. Hutt Hutt are a clan of crime lords that control territory in the outer rim. Hutts are a long-lived gastropoid species. They originated on Varl, but now claim Nal Hutta as their homeworld. Of them, Jabba the Hutt is perhaps the most famous, appearing in The Phantom Menace, A New Hope, and Return of the Jedi (where he was the first major antagonist.) Ziro the Hutt (who is Jabba's uncle) is probably the second most well-known, as he is prominently featured in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Gardulla the Hutt is mentioned in The Phantom Menace as the former slave owner of Anakin and Shmi Skywalker before losing a podracing bet to Toydarian junk dealer Watto; she also appears as a member of the Hutt Council in The Clone Wars. Durga the Hutt and Jiliac the Hutt are prominently featured as rival crime lords in the Han Solo trilogy, and Zorba the Hutt, who is Jabba's father, is featured prominently in the Jedi Prince series. Despite evidence of sexual deviance, Hutts are actually asexual, and choose when to give birth, as described in the second Han Solo trilogy and the Clone Wars novel. Iktotchi The Iktotchi are an alien race located in a remote system in the Expansion Region, next to the Corellian Run, along with neighboring planet Aridus. They have a tough, hairless, and often reddish skin, as well as two downward-sloping horns on the sides of the head. They are often known for their limited abilities in precognition and, because of this trait, can often be found in Jedi Academies. When the Republic discovered their home planet, a moon orbiting the planet Iktotchon, they discovered a massive Old Republic seal visible from space with the naked eye. One famous Iktotchi is Jedi Master Saesee Tiin, who sat on the Jedi Council. Iktotchi are also known for their skills as pilots. Even the worst Iktotchi pilot is still considered a more than useful being to have behind the controls of a spaceship or fighter. Iridonian/Zabrak The Iridonians are humanoids whose most distinctive feature is the array of small horns on top of their heads. Their home planet is Iridonia, though they have established many colonies on planets throughout the galaxy. It is believed that they are among the galaxy's first space-faring people. They have strong willpower and are a stubborn, proud people. By nature, they tend to be independent and fearless, hence have never been a successful venture in the slave trade. One commonly recognized individual of this race is Darth Maul, Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious. Their crown of horns typically grow in at puberty, and are considered secondary sex characteristics. The pattern in which these horns grow differs between Iridonian sub-species. Iridonian skin coloration can range from the rare pure white or pure black, to the more common shades of cream, red, peach, tan, and brown in between. Iridonian skin color is a matter of genetic dominance and recessiveness, such as with the Ewok species, whose fur comes in various colors and patterns. Iridonians can be completely bald or fully haired. Again, it is analogous to race/subspecies. Certain horn patterns are linked with certain hair patterns or lack thereof. Hair can be any of the same colors seen in the human species. However, unlike humans, Iridonian males do not have eyebrows and do not grow facial hair. There is also a different pattern of horns for each gender. The horns on the female are more directed to the front of the head, while the most commonly males have them spanned all across the top of their head. Iridonian eye colors are often similar to the eye colors of humans, with blues and browns being the most common. Yellow, purple, red, green, and orange eyes are seen regularly. However, Darth Maul's red-yellow eye color was apparently the result of corruption by the Dark Side. Iridonians also traditionally have facial tattoos, typically composed of a pattern of thin lines - which is considered the most traditional of Iridonian tattoos. In certain cases these tattoos can be quite elaborate (Maul's extensive black tattoo was actually a Nightbrother tattoo, not a traditional Iridonian tattoo), but most Iridonians tend to be conservative with their designs. It is unclear what these designs signify. They may indicate which family the Iridonian belongs to, where they grew up, or they may well be just a matter of personal preference on the part of the Iridonian. Iridonians are also well known for their skill with technology and highly advanced weaponry. Known Iridonians from canon include Agen Kolar, Eeth Koth, Gaar from the Boba Fett book, and Darth Maul. Known Iridonians from the Star Wars expanded universe include Bao-Dur (Knights of the Old Republic II), Maris Brood (Force Unleashed), and Wolf Sazen (Star Wars: Legacy). Iridonians are sometimes called Zabrak, but this is simply an offshoot \\"sub-species\\" of the Iridonian race. Ishi Tib Ishi Tibs are ecologist aliens from planet Tibrin. They are amphibious with huge eyes and beak-like mouths. They have lungs that double as internal gills, and they require immersion in briny water every 30 hours before their skin dries out. Ishi Tib are patient, thoughtful beings who are not prone to rash acts. Nonetheless, they are fiercely dedicated, completing any task they begin. Ishi Tib are ferocious fighters, especially when cornered. Offworld Ishi Tib are known for their devotion to nature, and for their excellent managerial skills. There are Ishi Tibs in Jabba the Hutt's palace and also in the Rebel briefing to attack the second Death Star. Ithorian Ithorians are a species of intelligent herbivores from the planet Ithor. They are commonly called \\"Hammerheads\\" because of their long, curving neck and T-shaped head. Ithorians have two mouths and glossy, brown flesh. In general, they are devoted environmentalists, staunch herbivores, and complete pacifists. Many have become galactic traders who peacefully travel the stars in giant herd ships. They will only resort to violence if threatened. Because of their mild demeanor, most Ithorians avoided the Galactic Civil War, although a few joined the Rebel Alliance. Ithorians are natives of the planet Ithor, a lush world with sprawling rain forests. The Ithorians worship Mother Jungle and long ago vowed never to desecrate their planet. Once they discovered repulsorlift technology, the Ithorians built expansive \\"herd cities\\" floating in the skies above their home world. The species migrated to these platforms, ensuring that Ithor would remain pristine forever. However, the Yuuzhan Vong destroyed their planet when the second in command released a plague that turned everything into a black sludge. Abroad, Ithorians have integrated well with the intergalactic community. Their own language is difficult for non-Ithorians to learn, as the Ithorians have twin mouths on opposite sides of their necks. However, they are able speak Basic, albeit with an accent. Their vocal cords are strong enough to produce a sound shockwave used in defense to stop an enemy in its tracks.Episode Recap at TV.com Ithorian Roron Corobb was a Jedi Master who died protecting Chancellor Palpatine from General Grievous during the Clone Wars. Momaw Nadon, an exiled Ithorian, was present in the Mos Eisley Cantina in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. As seen in Knights of the Old Republic II, Ithorians were also instrumental in the restoration of the planet Telos after it was destroyed by Sith during the Jedi Civil War. An Ithorian named Chodo Habat employed the help of a Jedi Exile during the Telos Restoration Project with the promise that he would cure the exile's \\"wound in the Force\\" if the Jedi Exile foiled Czerka Corporation's attempts to take over the restoration project. Jabiimas The Jabiimas are native to the planet Jabiim, and were neutral in the Clone Wars until the CIS attacked and destroyed many of their mountaintop Citadels and captured and relocated to hidden caverns inside the mountains. During the Republic's recapturing, many of them were forced into slave camps, but were freed at the last moment by the 501st Legion. Jawa A Jawa with the spore of a sarlacc from \\"Fortune, Fate, and the Natural History of the Sarlacc\\", Star Wars Tales 6 (2000) The Jawas are a pygmy rodent-like race inhabiting the desert planet of Tatooine. They work as scavengers and tinkerers, picking up discarded or broken machinery and fixing it up for sale. Being bald and pale, they are entirely covered in red or brown cloaks and their glowing yellow eyes are the only body parts visible. For transport on the desert world, they use long-abandoned mining sandcrawlers. These lumbering giants can house a family unit as well as store cargo that they have collected on their journeys. Jawas belong to clans. Half of the clan works in the sandcrawlers, while the other half lives in desert fortresses made from wrecked spaceships for protection against Tusken Raiders and krayt dragons. They also serve as a home for the rest of the Jawa clan which store the wealth gathered by the other family unit in the sandcrawlers. They are usually 1m to 1.5m tall (between three and five feet).Fernando Bueno, \\"Jawas,\\" Star Wars: The Force Unleashed Prima Official Game Guide (Roseville: Prima Games, 2008), 16. Jawas appear briefly in Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace during the Boonta Eve Classic Podrace, and in Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones, giving directions to Anakin Skywalker. They appear when Owen Lars and Luke Skywalker buy C-3PO and R2-D2 in Star Wars: A New Hope, as well as one Jawa appearing among the riffraff in Jabba the Hutt's palace in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. Two Jawas and a sandcrawler are seen at the end of The Rise of Skywalker. Jawas also appear on the planet Arvala-7 in \\"Chapter 2: The Child\\", the second episode of the television series The Mandalorian. Though Jawas are based upon Tatooine, some Jawas have left the planet and built up their civilizations elsewhere, such as the tribe on Arvala-7. Because Jawas enjoy scavenging, they tend to build their Sandcrawlers and engage in the same activities on other planets as they do on Tatooine. Specialists studying the past of the Sand People of the Tusken Raiders also used the term Ghorfa to denote an earlier sedentary phase of their culture, and lastly Kumumgah, for the earliest stratum of sentient civilization on the planet, believed by some to represent a common ancestry shared by the Ghorfas (the Tuskens) and the Jawas.

His village, Little Beard's Town was located near two other Seneca villages in modern Leicester in Livingston County, New York, and consisted of about 130 houses. Little Beard participated in the Cherry Valley massacre of 1778, and presided over the torture and death of Boyd and Parker, captured scouts of the Sullivan Expedition of 1779.

Star Wars is an American epic space opera film series created by George Lucas. The first film in the series, Star Wars, was released on 25 May 1977 and became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon, followed by five sequels, three prequels, three animated television shows, and one live action television series. Many species of alien creatures (often humanoid) are depicted. Kaleesh The Kaleesh are a nomadic and politically neutral race from the planet Kalee. A bipedal reptilian species, the Kaleesh have reddish brown scaly skin and cover almost all their bodies to protect them from Kalee's blistering sun, usually leaving only their four-fingered claws exposed. Most wear masks carved from the skulls of their most feared creatures such as the karabac and the mumuu. During the Huk War, the Republic sided with their enemy, destroying their economy and deepening the already hard times hurting their homeworld. The Intergalactic Banking Clan, headed by San Hill, later came in and helped them out of their depression through a deal for the Kaleesh to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS). One Kaleesh cyborg, General Grievous became the feared military leader of the CIS during The Clone Wars. Although his original form was not shown in Episode III, Grievous had statues of his former self in his home at Vassek during the Clone Wars. One statue remains unchanged, but two more have the golden arms and mask that Grievous has as a cyborg. Kaminoan Tall, thin aliens with pale skin from the isolated planet of Kamino; the most distinctive feature of Kaminoans are their long necks. Males also have a ridge along the back of their heads. They like to be isolated from the galaxy. Kaminoans were forced to reproduce through cloning after a natural disaster on Kamino. They work creating and training clones for third parties from stations on massive platforms above the sea. Kaminoans seem to be unconcerned about the ethics of their workings. Darth Tyranus erased all traces of planet Kamino from the Jedi archives. Kaminoans developed the Grand Army of the Republic, as shown in Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones. They resemble the stereotypical image of grey aliens in their face and limbs, and engage in similar activities that seem to revolve around genetics and physical experiments. Kaminoans were able to see colours in the ultraviolet and the infrared spectrum. While to Human eyes the halls of the Kaminoan cities were spotless white, to the Kaminoans they were vividly coloured. Taun We and Lama Su are examples of Kaminoans. Karkarodon The Karkarodon were a race of shark-like sentients from the world of Karkaris. They were first introduced in Star Wars: the Clone Wars. The species were known to be fast swimmers, often ripping apart their enemies with their teeth. Kel Dor The Kel Dor, sometimes referred to as Kel Dorians, hail from the technological planet Dorin. They require masks to protect them from oxygen-rich atmospheres and to protect their highly sensitive eyes from light. They are also known for their Force Sages, the Baran Do. One prominent Kel Dor is Jedi Master and Council member, Plo Koon, but Plo is not the only Kel Dor Jedi of his family. His niece, Sha Koon is also a Jedi, but she is not in the movies, or any of the Clone Wars episodes that aired so far. Keshiri The Keshiri are a near-human species from the Wild Space planet of Kesh. The race characteristics include purple or lavender coloured skin and hair colours which include silver and white shades. About five thousand years before the Battle of Yavin, a Sith starship crashlanded on Kesh; the crew, who came to become known as the Lost Tribe of Sith, subsequently subjugated the Keshiri, some of whom eventually joined the Sith. The Keshiri were introduced in the Fate of the Jedi novels. Kiffar The Kiffar are a near-human species from the Azurbani system, including Kiffu and Kiffex. The Jedi Master Quinlan Vos was a Kiffar. The race characteristics seem to include dark, tanned skin and long thick dark hair, usually worn in dreadlocks, and there are certain tattoos that are ceremonial. One in a hundred Kiffar inherits a psychometric talent to read the history of objects that they touch. The Kiffar seem to be clannish and their strongest members compose an order known as the Guardians, which seems to be rather powerful. Kitonak Droopy McCool, a Kitonak Kitonaks (also known as Kirdans) are white, pudgy aliens from Kirdo III. They show a tough skin which folds to seal vulnerable openings, a trait evolved to protect them from the harsh environment of Kirdo's deserts. They also have some double organs, including two pairs of lungs. Kitonaks are very dexterous, but also very patient. They never rush. This is because they feed on animals called choobas and they must stand motionless for a long time until a chooba gets near them. Even when talking with humans or other aliens, Kitonaks are painfully slow to answer any question, and equally slow to walk as they do not move their legs, but expand and contract the muscles of their feet. Kitonak have two toes and three fingers. They eat once a month. They also have a phobia of quicksands and caves. Droopy \\"Snit\\" McCool of the Max Rebo Band, Anarc, Kruc, and Terno are the only known Kitonaks. Klatooinian Klatooinians come from the planet Klatooine. When the Hutts were waging a war against Xim the Despot, they looked for help on some planets. As a result, the Hutts asked the Klatooinians to become part of their army. Since the Klatooinians thought it was some kind of sacred war, their leader Barada M'Beg signed a treaty so that the Klatooinians would be slaves of the Hutts forever. After defeating Xim, Klatooinians remained slaves of the Hutts. Most of their children are named Barada to honour Barada M'Beg. One of the thugs on Jabba the Hutt's skiff was a Klatooinian named Barada. See also Nikto and Klaatu barada nikto, a famous quote from The Day the Earth Stood Still. One Klatooinian Jedi is Tarados Gon. Kobok Kobok were an insectoid species that live on planet Koboth. They have two orange compound eyes and three-fingers. One famous face was Gaff, a Roon representative in the New Republic. Kowakian monkey-lizard The Kowakian monkey-lizards are a vulturous sentient species from the planet Kowak. They are small, with beak-like mouths and large ears. When born monkey- lizards come out in a larval state. It is a well-known fact that monkey- lizards laugh, a lot. On their home planet their laughter is used to scare predators away, because of how loud they laugh. When in captivity, they are not paired with other species because their laughter is too great and too loud. Salacious B. Crumb was one of the most famous Kowakian monkey-lizards, as he is the only one seen in any of the Star Wars movies. An unnamed, fuchsia-skinned Kowakian monkey-lizard appears in 2 episodes of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, \\"Dooku Captured\\" and \\"The Gungan General\\", as the pet of Hondo Ohnaka, leader of a band of Weequay pirates. Another Kowakian monkey-lizard is seen roasting on a spit at a market in the first episode of The Mandalorian as a second monkey lizard watches from a nearby cage. Kubaz The Kubaz are an insect-eating species with long snouts [that have been known to be informants for the Empire.] One such Kubaz, by the name of Garindan, led Imperial stormtroopers to the droids on Tatooine in A New Hope. Because of their diet, the insectoid Verpine have a marked distrust of the Kubaz who have often taken great steps to procure Verpine specimens for their suppers. Kurtzen The Kurtzen are a pale, hairless, humanoid race from Bakura. Being the only native sentient species on Bakura, and few in number, they were quickly outnumbered by human colonists. Kushiban Jedi Master Ikrit is Kushiban Kushiban are small rabbit-like creatures that live on Kushibah in the Star Wars galaxy. Distinguishing features include large black eyes, floppy ears, and a long tail. They are capable of walking on either their hind legs or on all fours, though to move more quickly in a run or a charge, they must run with all four appendages. On their hind legs they stand at 0.5 meters or 1.6404 feet tall, with an extra 0.3 meters' worth of tail. While often mistaken for cute, pet- like animals, they are actually intelligent beings with a complex culture as well as both a written and spoken language. They have mastered fire (used to frighten away hostile, fire-fearing Xinkras) and can use technology. Rather than paws, they have hands with opposable thumbs and feet. As a means of communication, Kushibans' fur changes color in correlation to its mood. A Kushiban in a calm, normal state of emotions is white; a Kushiban in the deepest of despairs is totally black. While they tend to stay on Kushibah, the occasional Kushiban is called away by wanderlust or a specific need. Jedi Master Ikrit is the most famous of the Kushiban who have done so.  Kwa  The Kwa were an ancient, blue-skinned race that lived on the planet Dathomir. They created the Star Temples and the Infinity Gate on Dathomir around 100,000 BBY. Over time the Kwa sealed their temples and left large wuffa worms to guard them. Nobody really knows what happened to the Kwa, but the ones that were on Dathomir devolved into the primitive Kwi.  Kwi  A primitive, blue- skinned, saurians species native to Dathomir, the Kwi degenerated from the Kwa, the masterminds behind the Star Temples and Infinity Gate on Dathomir. In 31 BBY, many Kwi were slaughtered by the Nightsisters of Dathomir in an attempt, by the Nightsisters, to unlock the power of the Infinity Gate. By the time Luke Skywalker and Prince Isolder landed on Dathomir in 8 ABY, the Kwi had split up into different tribes, two of which were the Blue Mountain People and the Blue Desert People. Kyuzo The Kyuzo are a race of humanoid creatures. They have green skin and have masks to filter out moisture. A famous Kyuzo is the bounty hunter Embo. Lannik The Lannik are a race of tan skinned humanoids from a plant of the same name. They have long ears, similar to Yoda's species. The most prominent one is Even Piell, a member of the Jedi Council. Lasat The Lasat are a crafty and sneaky sentient species from Lasan. They are stronger, swifter and stealthier than humans. Their planet was taken over by the Empire who committed a mass genocide on its people. The Lasat's origin is from the planet Lira San (the Lasats' true homeworld), and sometime in between they settled the planet Lasan. At some point Lasan was destroyed by the Empire. Jaro Tapal was a Lasat Jedi Master who appeared in the 2019 video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Zeb Orrelios from Star Wars: Rebels is a Lasat. Lepi The Lepi are a rabbit-like species that stand on two legs. This was the Basic name used to describe the Lepus carnivorus, a species of tall, furred lagomorphs which was native to the planet Coachelle Prime. The Lepi were a carnivorous race, distinguished by their large incisors and the various colours of their fur, which ranged from green to dark blue. Despite their appearance, the Lepi were a technologically advanced race, having achieved spaceflight and colonized the five planets in the system and the neighbouring asteroid belt. Lepi were considered sexually mature at just ten years of age, and females often gave birth to litters of three dozen or more offspring, resulting in a swift growth in their population. This growth spurred on the development of their space-travel technology, as colony worlds were seen as a response to overpopulation of Coachelle Prime. Individual Lepi were known for their increased metabolism, a trait that often manifested itself as hyper-activity There was also the native language of the Lepus carnivorus race, which was also referred to as Lepp or Lepese Letaki The Letaki are a race from the planet Letaki in the Star Wars universe. Letaki have eight tentacles and egg-shaped heads. Evar Orbus is an example of a male Letaki. Lurmen The Lurmen (also known as Mygeetans) are a diminutive, pacifistic lemuroid mammalian species native to the crystalline world of Mygeeto and also had a settlement on Maridun. Their bodies were covered entirely in fur, which ranged in color from a dark brown to a white-gray, though they did wear garments. The Lurmen had heads protruding perpendicular from their chest two large golden orange eyes, a nose and a mouth. Each Lurmen had a tail, and they communicated through speech; Lurmen were able to speak Basic. Some Lurmen had the ability to curl up into a ball and roll along the ground, such as Wag Too. Lurmen were able to cover large amounts of ground at great speed. Most Lurmen were pacifistic by nature and refused to fight or run even in the face of death. They often would hide instead of using violence. As pacifists, they carried no weapons but carried farming tools or ropes. When some Lurmen fought the Separatists, they refrained from ever destroying or killing the enemy. Their farming tools were used mostly as a leverage tool in these tactics and to provide something to tie the rope to, though sometimes they were used as a weapon for striking an enemy. Massassi The Massassi were an ancient primitive warrior race that were enslaved by the Sith. The Massassi were brought to Yavin 4 by the Sith Lord Naga Sadow who was on the run from the Republic and the Jedi. They were originally a red-skinned humanoid race until Naga Sadow conducted cruel genetic experiments on them turning them into a race of fearsome, savage, hunchbacked predators. Despite this cruelty, the Massassi treated Naga Sadow as a god by building huge temples and palaces to honor their Sith Lord. They became extinct when Exar Kun sapped the life out of every Massassi on Yavin 4 so that he could free his soul from his body in order to escape the pursuing Jedi. Only one Massassi, named Kalgrath, survived. During the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance built a base in the old Massassi temples on Yavin 4. It was from this hidden base that Rebel starships were able to score their first victory against the Empire, and from which squadrons of X-wings and Y-wings attacked and destroyed the first Death Star. In 22 ABY (After the Battle of Yavin), during the time covered by the Junior Jedi Knights series, Anakin Solo and Tahiri Veila were led by the Force to find a large golden globe deep inside a Massassi temple on Yavin 4. Inside the globe were the imprisoned souls of Massassi children whom the young Jedi candidates eventually freed with guidance from Jedi Master Ikrit. Melodie The Melodies are an amphibious, mermaid-like humanoid species that live in Yavin 8's purple mountains, lakes and rivers. They appeared in the second book of the Junior Jedi Knights series. Melodies are hatched from eggs, then live on land for a short time during their youth, and at a certain age, Melodies undergo a ritual called a Changing Ceremony, in which they change forms that will no longer enable them to live on land. When Exar Kun imprisoned the Massassi children on Yavin 4 during his reign in 3,997 BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin), the parents of the Massassi children went to Yavin 8 and met the Melodie children, whom they asked for help. The children took them to the Elders, but because of the Elders' forms, they could not leave the waters. The Massassi carved messages into the walls of a cave, hoping that someone would eventually arrive who could read their language and come to their aid. A millennia later, Sannah, a Force-sensitive Melodie, helped Anakin Solo and Tahiri Veila (who had come to Yavin 8 with Lyric, a student from the Academy who was about to undergo the Changing Ceremony) to decipher the carvings. The information helped them to ultimately free the imprisoned Massassi children later in the Junior Jedi Knights series. Mimbanite An alien species from Circarpous V, the Mimbanites were related to the Coway. When the Empire took control of their planet, they thought this species was not suited for the physical demands of slavery. Miraluka An alien race almost exactly the same in appearance as humans, Miraluka differ in that they have no eyes or blank white sockets and cannot see through the focusing of light. Miraluka typically hide their lack of eyes by wearing a headband, a mask, or similar concealing headwear, because they are much less common than humans, and it is easier to travel if they are seen as being of the dominant species; thus the common confusion as to who is or isn't a Miraluka. Miralukas see through the Force, as they are a Force-sensitive race; they are often quite shocked if shown life not connected to the Force, like the Jedi Exile. The Miraluka homeworld is Alpheridies. They migrated there after their original homeworld, Katarr, became unstable and began losing its atmosphere to space. Alpheridies' sun emits light in the infra-red spectrum, and this led to the Miraluka losing their ability to see visible light over thousands of generations. Instead, they came to rely on a latent ability to perceive the world through the Force. A colony world of the Miraluka named Katarr was stripped of all life by a Sith Lord named Darth Nihilus approximately 3,955 years BBY, during a meeting of several Jedi Masters. The meeting was convened to discuss the silent war being waged across the galaxy by Sith Lords Darth Nihilus and Darth Sion. The only survivor of this colony world was Visas Marr, who later became the servant of Darth Nihilus and then followed the Jedi Exile and helped destroy Darth Nihilus and his ship. Notable Miraluka include former Sith Visas Marr, and the Dark Jedi Jerec. Mirialan The Mirialan race is a species native to the planet Mirial. They have purer eye colours than humans, some have either paler or darker skin colours, and tattoos covering some part of their face that represent individual achievement in some field. They have extrasensory organs on their heads, sensitive to dryness.Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, The Visual Dictionary, p.61 Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and her Padawan learner, Barriss Offee are both Mirialans, as is the Seventh Sister seen in Star Wars Rebels; one male Mirialan Jedi master named Ardray was featured in the MMORPG game Star Wars: The Old Republic. Mon Calamari The Mon Calamari are an amphibious race from the planet Mon Calamari. They are humanoid, about 1.7m tall, and are most commonly seen with salmon-coloured skin (though their skin may have other tones as well, including blue, dark blue, green, and purple) and a high-domed head with large eyes and webbed hands. With their eyes toward the sides of their heads, they must turn slightly to study visual objects. They are shore dwellers, but like to be close to water, and can breathe under water if necessary, being able to descend to depths of 30 or so metres without equipment. They share their home planet with the Quarren. Their name is a reference to the close resemblance of their heads to calamari (squid). Mon Calamari tend to prefer modern Republic style clothing, while the Quarren wear more traditional robes. During the Clone Wars, the Mon Calamari remained with the Galactic Republic, but the Quarren sided with the CIS. The CIS sought to overthrow the Calamari quickly by providing the Quarren with a huge underwater droid army. With the aid of Jedi Kit Fisto, the Calamari demonstrated their traditional underwater fighting techniques. Riding underwater mounts, they carry shields and lances that contain blasters. During the Galactic Civil War, the Mon Calamari eventually joined the Rebel Alliance after the Empire used a Star Destroyer to destroy three floating cities on their watery world. They proved an invaluable asset, primarily due to the Mon Calamari being masters of starship construction and supplying the Alliance with badly needed capital ships, Mon Calamari Cruisers, that could take on the Galactic Empire's ships of the line. Prior to joining the Alliance, the Mon Calamari had only built passenger liners because of their peaceful ethos. Also renowned for their performance art, lithe Mon Calamari water dancers often perform in some of the galaxy's most prestigious venues, including Coruscant Galaxies Opera House, where the ballet \\"Squid Lake\\" ran for some time during the waning days of the Republic and was known to be a personal favourite of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. The most famous Mon Calamari is Admiral Ackbar, the supreme admiral of the Rebel Alliance's naval forces. Another Rebellion-sympathetic male Mon Calamari named Quarrie, the spacecraft engineer character named for Star Wars visual artist Ralph McQuarrie,SWCA: Star Wars Rebels: Past, Present, and Future Panel Liveblog  StarWars.com was the designer of the B-wing starfighter prototype named the Blade Wing, as seen in the Star Wars Rebels second-season episode \\"Wings of the Master\\". Mon Calamari are a playable species in Star Wars: Galaxies. In the Star Wars: Legacy comic, Darth Krayt launched an attack on the Mon Calamari and wiped almost all of them out through gassing, making the Mon Calamari an endangered people in this continuity. Mustafarian Mustafarians are the native inhabitants of Mustafar. They have leathery skin with a cloak and a trunk. Not much else is known about this species as they live in seclusion. They are believed to be sentient and are able to withstand extreme temperatures. They have saddles for lava fleas and carry defensive laser rifles. As a manhood ritual they leap across \\"water-falls\\" of magma wearing no protection. When the Techno Union established mining facilities on the planet, many of the Mustafarians took up jobs as workers at one of the many mining facilities. Muun A thin, tall species from Muunilinst, Muuns have pasty-white skin. Their bodies were elongated and thin, with equally elongated and thin heads. Muuns do not like travelling, and they usually stay indoors. Muuns are also known for having long life. Muuns controlled the InterGalactic Banking Clan. During the Clone Wars, Muuns helped the Separatists and minted new coins for planets leaving the Republic. Notable Muun were Darth Sidious's master, Darth Plagueis the Wise, and the ruling members of the InterGalactic Banking Clan including San Hill. Darth Plagueis had the ability to use the dark side of the force to influence midi-chlorians to create life and to prevent people from dying- the only Force user to have such a power. Myneyrsh A 4-armed, crystal-skinned alien species indigenous to the planet Wayland. Myriad The Myriad are an ancient race of highly intelligent cybernetic beings. Their true form is not known because the cybernetic implants vary. Their home world is the planet Trieron They have no affiliation with any one group, but serve all races. Nagai The Nagai are aliens with pale skin, jet-black hair and angular features, they lived on the planet Nagi, beyond the borders of the Old Republic and the Empire. They were originally known as \\"Knives\\". They were natural enemies of the Tof, usually waging wars against them. They are habitually forgetful, particularly regarding things that pertain to annual events. Darth Nihl is a Nagai. Nautolan Nautolans are amphibious humanoids with a range of skin colours from greens to blues and greys, a cartilage- reinforced skeleton, and shark-like eyes. Instead of hair, a Nautolan sports a crown of long tendrils, 14 to be exact (used to discern the feelings and moods of those around them. These appendages are almost useless out of water unless, like Kit Fisto, said Nautolan is used to environmental change). Their homeworld is Glee Anselm, a planet of vast swamps, lakes, and seas located in the Mid Rim. However Nautolans are relatively common at any space port. Nautolans reflect the moods of those around them. When confronted by anger and violence, they respond in kind. When approached in a calm, civilized manner, they seem helpful and polite. Jedi Master Kit Fisto was a Nautolan. Neimoidian Neimoidians are the most visible villains of the film The Phantom Menace. According to the Star Wars expanded universe, Neimoidians are descendants of Duro colonists that landed on Neimoidia in the year of the Republic inception. At some point in their development, the Neimoidians learned to domesticate giant beetles, and they have been getting others to do physical labor for them ever since as stated in Labyrinth of Evil. By the time of The Phantom Menace, the Neimoidians control the galaxy's largest commercial corporation and are at the head of the powerful Trade Federation. Neimoidians are born as grubs and placed in communal hives until the age of seven. Inadequate food is fed to young Neimoidians in order to encourage acquisitiveness. Those who hoard enough food survive while those who do not hoard die. Even as adults, Neimoidians tend to be greedy, possessive, and fearful of death. Eventually, the grubs learn that to survive, they must kill each other; therefore out of the many grubs that are born, very few survive. Neimoidians have been stereotyped by other races in the galaxy as corrupt and greedy, particularly after the Battle of Naboo. They are certainly willing to resort to extortion, lies and manipulation, but their success also lies in exceptional organizational abilities. Training in organization revolves around Neimoidia's mass hives and huge fungus farms. Neimoidian young are placed in a community hive where they are forced to combat their siblings for food and other necessities. The weak die, since the strong hoard food and resources. This is said to be the source of their characteristic greed and corrupt nature. The Neimoidians do not view themselves as wicked, but rather focused on being the best they can be in their society. The Trade Federation army is employed only when \\"future customers\\" do not realize their \\"best interest\\" in trading with Neimoidians, on Neimoidian terms. Neimoidian culture is extremely hierarchical. Although the monarch of the Neimoidians is never seen in the films, every Neimoidian ship carries a hologram of her. Amongst the seen Neimoidians, clothing denotes status: * Lott Dod wears a tall diplomatic ploov and a purple representative's mantle over a very expensive robe of Tyrian violet cloth. * Nute Gunray, Commanding Viceroy of the Federation army, wears a showy crested tiara and blue viceroy's collar. * Rune Haako, legal counsel to Nute, wears an attorney's cowl. * Daultay Dofine, captain of the flagship vessel for the Naboo invasion, wears a tall command officer's mitre. * An unnamed Neimoidian wears a lavender collar identifying him as a financial officer. * The most exalted Neimoidians rank a walking mechno-chair. Neither comfortable nor practical, mechno-chairs are very expensive beetle-like seats which can carry a lazy Neimoidian or project hologram transmissions. Neimoidians also employ a number of prestigious protocol droids, including the brilliantly silver TC-14. TC-14 is kept docile through frequent memory wipes and is employed to distract guests while the Neimoidians devise manipulation strategies. In contrast to the rare and showy technology of the Neimoidian elite, the battle forces of the Neimoidians are mechanically advanced, but cheaply mass-produced. An emphasis is placed on massive, intimidating numbers of mindless battle droids controlled through a central computer. This unquestioning reliance on a central control is what will ultimately spell failure for the mechanized army. Episode II revealed that their form closely resembles that of the vaguely insect-like natives of Geonosis, where the droids are mass-produced. Much like many of the Imperial Officers in the Original Star Wars Trilogy were given British accents, some Neimoidians have been given Thai accents. Nelvaanian Canine-muzzled humanoids introduced in Season 3 of the animated series Star Wars: Clone Wars. They live on the planet Nelvaan on the Outer Rim. All of their warrior braves were captured by Techno- Union scientists and were physically and mentally mutated into large bear-like creatures with their left arms replaced with laser cannons, to try to create perfect cyborg soldiers for the CIS. During the Liberation of Nelvaan, Anakin Skywalker, who was referred to by the race as \\"Holt Kezed\\" (\\"Ghost Hand\\" in their language), would free them as he destroyed the Separatist base. Following this, Anakin killed all Techno-Union scientists there and managed to bring the mutated Nelvaanians back to their tribe. On a behind-the-scenes note, the name \\"Nelvaanian\\" may be a reference to Nelvana, the Canadian animation company who produced the Star Wars: Droids and Star Wars: Ewoks animated features for Lucasfilm. Nelvana's logo is a blue polar bear. Neti The Neti were a race of sentient shape-shifting tree-like beings from Rykk. Jedi Master Ood Bnar was a Neti. Nikto The Nikto people are a humanoid species from the planet Kintan who have scaly skin, black eyes, and symmetrical horns and spikes on their faces. Subspecies include Green Nikto (Kadas'sa'Nikto) and Red Nikto (Kajain'sa'Nikto). Niktos are first introduced in Return of the Jedi (1983) in the form of Klaatu, a Green Nikto who serves Jabba the Hutt. Red Nikto appear in The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). Ima-Gun Di is a Red Nikto Jedi Master in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Nikto of both subspecies were protecting The Child in the episode \\"Chapter 1: The Mandalorian\\" of The Mandalorian. In the 2016 novel Star Wars: Bloodline, the Red Nikto crime lord Rinnrivin Di heads a dangerous cartel based on the planet Bastatha. The bombardment of Kintan by stellar radiation from the explosion of a nearby star had sparked rapid evolution in its native species. For several centuries, the Niktos were ruled over by a violent and fanatical religious organization called the Cult of M'dweshuu, which was much despised by the majority of Kintan's population. When the Hutts were waging a war against Xim the Despot, they saw the Niktos' situation as an opportunity to recruit another servant species into their army. A fleet of Huttese starships bombarded the Cult of M'dweshuu's stronghold from orbit, wiping it out, and the grateful Niktos eagerly signed the Treaty of Vontor, placing themselves in servitude to the Hutts indefinitely. Noghri The Noghri are a primitive humanoid species with steely gray skin. They are extremely skilled assassins due to their innate abilities at stealth and hand-to-hand combat. Like the Wookiees, they respect honor above all else. The Noghri are natives of the planet Honoghr, which was ravaged by toxins from a Trade Federation core ship destroyed in battle during the Clone Wars. Darth Vader visited the planet some time later under the guise of helping it recover from the ecological disaster, in exchange recruiting most of the young males of the planet into a bond of servitude as the personal assassins of Emperor Palpatine. With the Noghri still in service to the Galactic Empire five years after the death of Palpatine, Grand Admiral Thrawn orders them to kidnap the pregnant Leia Organa Solo. Realizing that neither she nor her children would be truly safe as long as the Noghri serve the Empire, she goes to Honoghr in order to convince the Noghri to leave the Empire's service. Through their acute sense of smell, the Noghri easily recognize Leia as the daughter of the revered Vader, and she is able to use this fact to convince the Noghri that the Empire has been lying to them and has kept them in virtual slavery for many years. As a result, the Noghri turn against the Empire. Thrawn dies when his Noghri bodyguard Rukh turns on him and stabs him. Following the death of Thrawn, the Noghri ally themselves with the New Republic. They help resettle the Noghri to other planets (including Wayland) to give Honoghr time to heal. Leia and her entire family become very highly respected figures in Noghri society. The Noghri save the Solo family from a Yuuzhan Vong strike force. Much like Chewbacca did with Han Solo, the Noghri always make sure Leia has bodyguards. The Noghri appear extensively in the Thrawn trilogy of novels, written by Timothy Zahn, and are also playable in the Forces of Corruption Expansion for Star Wars Empire at War, armed with disrupter rifles. Nosaurian Nosaurians are reptilian creatures that have spikes on their head and beaklike mouths. One notable Nosaurian is the Podracer Clegg Holdfast. Ogemite The Ogemite are a near-Human avian race native to the planet Ogem. They have yellow skin and short, blond, feather- like hair, similar to the Omwati. Omwati Although the Omwati are not a branch of humanity, the differences are extremely small. The Omwati skin is a bluish color and their eyes are generally blue or black. The size of an adult Omwati borders that of a human, although their morphology is typically slightly frailer with regard to females. There are very few Omwati with a stout physiology. Their most striking characteristic is their \\"hair\\" which appears to be made of small, diaphanous feathers of an iridescent color. Omwati do not have any other hair. The Omwati rarely left their homeworld and rarely took part in galactic events, until Wilhuff Tarkin enslaved the youngest of their species to serve as Imperial scientists. Qui Xux is perhaps the best-known member of the Omwati species. She was a researcher at the Imperial Maw Installation and a principal designer of the Death Star. The Rogue Jedi Kyp Durron ripped her memories of both this technology and her past from her mind. Ongree The Ongree are a bizarre looking species from the Skustell Cluster. The Jedi Pablo-Jill was an Ongree. Ortolan OrtolansThe Ortolans are a race of a no armed, fat blue-skinned creatures with long snouts, not all that different from a small elephant. One example is Max Rebo, head of The Max Rebo Band, contracted to play in Jabba the Hutt's Tatooine palace. Possessing a love of food and music, these small aliens are also adept at surviving the frigid temperatures of their homeworld Orto.\\"Orto\\", Stephen J. Sansweet, The Star Wars Encyclopedia (New York: Del Rey, 1998), p. 220. . Oswaft Large manta-ray like creatures that were encountered by Lando Calrissian during his early adventures in the Outer Rim. They live in a nebula called ThonBoka where they are nourished by nutrients from their sun. They live in the vacuum of space and have the unusual ability to travel through hyperspace for short distances. If an Oswaft is deprived of nutrients from a star for too long it will turn opaque and die. They can also subsist on the waste products of spaceships such as the Millennium Falcon and produce waste in the form of valuable minerals.

Star Wars is an American epic space opera film series created by George Lucas. The first film in the series, Star Wars, was released on 25 May, 1977 and became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon, followed by five sequels and three prequels. Many species of alien creatures (often humanoid) are depicted. Paaerduag In Galactic Basic, the Paaerduag is an \\"individual\\" formed by two symbiotic races that are joined as one. However, two voices create the actual name of their race, and four ears hear the true sound of it. The larger, more mobile, aspect of the Paaerduag looks like a humanoid, with long, slender arms and legs, and a head about as broad as its body, however, its voice is unheard by human ears. The smaller aspect of the Paaerduag rides upon the larger in a backpack, of sorts, facing to the rear, and looks remotely like a humanoid with a slender, almost dog-like face, and two sets of eyes. It is capable of being heard and understood. Instead of referring to itself as \\"I\\" or \\"me\\", it uses the term \\"we\\", instead. Their home is called, in Galactic Basic, Sorjus, a small and unimportant world far off the Perlemian trade route, and has an apparently rather temperate climate (as noted from Mic'Tunan'Jus's complaints about Tatooine's climate being far too dry, and the dust is rough on their hide). They begin life as individuals, however, at the age of choosing, they become bonded to their other half, and grow together as a single, complete being, sharing their brains, vision, hearing, and speech. There are two Paaerduag in Knights of the Old Republic: one in Javyar's Cantina on Taris, the other is a merchant in the docking area of Tatooine. Pa'lowick The Pa'lowick are native to the swampy world of Lowick. They have bulbous bodies supported by long, reed-thin legs. A Pa'lowick's eyes are on short stalks that jut from their heads, their mouths are located at the end of a long, thin proboscis. Lowick is not a technologically advanced world, and most Pa'lowick do not leave. Other species travel to Lowick to mine the rare and beautiful Lowickian firegems. A notable Pa'lowick is Sy Snootles, the singer of the Max Rebo Band and ex-girlfriend of Ziro the Hutt. There are only 5 known Pa'lowicks: Sy Snootles, Sam Snootles, Keesa, Larisselle Chatrunis, and Aneesa Dym. Pau'an Pau'ans were gaunt near-Humans native to the planet Utapau. Also known as Utapauns and Ancients due to their long lifespans, they co- existed on Utapau with the Utai. The two species got along well, with the lanky Pau'ans assuming leadership roles on the planet. Though some viewed the Pau'ans as frightening, they were friendly, and were more than happy to welcome visitors to their little-known world. Due to Utapau's remoteness in the Outer Rim Territories, the Pau'ans were isolated for most of their history. However, they played a part in galactic events in 19 BBY, when the Confederacy of Independent Systems conquered Utapau. The Pau'ans opposed the Confederacy with the aid of the Republic, and later opposed the Empire, after Imperials took control of their planet following the Declaration of a New Order. The average member of the sentient near-Human Pau'an, or Utapaun, as they were sometime called, species stood taller than a Human, at approximately 1.9 meters. They were bald and their head was striped with furrowed gray skin. Pau'ans weighed seventy kilograms on average. Pau'ans had large, sunken black eyes in red eye sockets and jagged, fang-like teeth used for tearing into raw meat, as they were carnivores. The species had pale, wrinkled skin, due to the fact that they lived in the sinkholes of Utapau, giving them limited access to light. These traits caused some to view them as frightening. However, Pau'ans as a society were generally friendly, and were happy to welcome guests to their often overlooked world. Pau'ans had long lifespans, living up to 700 years, much longer than the Utai, the other species native to Utapau. This earned them the nickname of \\"Ancients\\". Members of the species were able to see well in darkness. Pau'ans had four fingers and toes, but were more mobile than they appeared. They often wore elaborate clothes intended to heighten their impressive stature. Most Pau'ans spoke both Utapese and Basic. The Pau'ans fulfilled most of the governmental and administrative duties on Utapau, as the Utai did not desire such work, serving as labourers instead. Most Pau'ans served as leaders early in their lives, often managing teams of Utai labourers. This gave them experience that would be used later in their life. Pau'ans were kind leaders, and sympathetic to their subordinates. Despite the many differences between the Pau'ans and the Utai, the two species were able to co-exist peacefully, although inhabitants of the different Utapaun cities often had conflicts due to philosophical differences. Still, these conflicts rarely developed into bloodshed, and it was more common for the cities to ignore each other. Each city had its own culture, and competition was fierce between the groups. However, they were able to cooperate when the situation necessitated it, such as during the Confederate invasion of the planet in 19 BBY. Pau'an society was a blend of a variety of styles and cultures, borne from the ancient merger with the Utai. Built into the sinkhole walls, Pau'an settlements such as the Pau City spaceport were divided into different areas, each a mix of architectural styles and other- worldly design. They liked art, and enjoyed studying sculptures and finding ways to incorporate different artistic styles into their architecture. Pau'ans developed an industrial society, despite their seemingly primitive and natural image, though the Utai were the ones who actually did the hard work. The Utai did not mind, however, and collectively much preferred labour to positions of leadership.[1] They were able to power their city by wind, harnessing it through massive windmills. Over ninety-nine percent of the planet's power came from these windmills. Most Pau'ans rode living beasts like varactyls and dactillions instead of speeders. Each city was controlled by whomever held the title of Master of Port Administration in that city. These administrators were assisted by advisory councils. The Utapauan Committee, which was composed of representatives from the different cities, governed the planet. However, it rarely made crucial decisions, as the cities were able to function on their own most of the time, turning to the Utapauan Security Force when necessary. Pau'ans represented 30%‚Äîor approximately 28.5 million‚Äîof Utapau's total population of 90 million inhabitants, although their influence as administrators and leaders more than made up for their lack of numbers. Darth Desolous was a Pau'an as was the Imperial Grand Inquisitor. Phlog The Phlogs are peaceful giants living on planet Genesia. Phlogs were giant sapients. They were used throughout the galaxy as guards, thugs, and gladiators, on planets such as Genesia. One group intended for slavery became stranded on the forest moon of Endor. Polis Massan Polis Massans are humanoid aliens who inhabit the asteroid colony of Polis Massa in the Subterrel sector. These thin, mute beings lead mining expeditions and medical research on their remote settlement. Polis Massa is actually the largest remnant of their original homeworld, which was fractured by a natural cataclysm. The survivors took up residence there and began mining the asteroid for artifacts from their former civilization. These archaeological digs were in progress for so long that the mining supervisors came to be known as Polis Massans, having adopted the asteroid as their new homeworld. Polis Massans are typically short, thin beings with flat, pale faces and grey hands, each with four long, dexterous fingers. They use sign language and control devices to make their intentions known. To make up for their lack of speech, Polis Massans have mildly telepathic brains and deep-focus eyes, useful for work deep underground. They have osmotic membrane faces and growth-rings circling their wiry bodies. Many Polis Massans are miners, medics, or exobiologists. They tend to wear form-fitting bodysuits fitted with all manner of signaling devices, medical equipment, and utility pouches. Most Polis Massan miners are seasoned spelunkers who dig deep into the core of their asteroid to locate prize artifacts. The exobiologists among them learned the secrets of cloning from the Kaminoans, whom they resemble. They use this knowledge to analyze the artifacts for organic tissue suitable for cloning. They set up a medical facility on the asteroid to investigate their finds. Although they have little contact with humans, Polis Massans are known for their extraordinary medical skills, and are regarded as compassionate beings who understand the value of life. Polis Massan medics and technicians helped to deliver the Skywalker twins when Padm√© Amidala was rushed to the asteroid facility in critical condition. Only two members of the team were trained physicians. The rest were exobiologists, who had no time even to change out of their caving jumpsuits because of her condition. Although the twins were delivered safely with the help of a midwife droid, the Polis Massans could not mend Padm√©'s broken heart, and she died at the medical center. Priapulin The Priapulin are a caterpillar-like species from the planet Pria. They have extremely flexible bodies, with five knobby notochords arranged along their tubular length. Their eyes are arranged in three pairs, one above the other, along the upper portion of their bodies. Their undersides are covered with thick brushy bristles. Thick flexible spines emerge along the edges of their bodies. They speak by rubbing the bristles in front of their spiracles, or breathing vents, and surprisingly speak clearly. They need to be in water almost all the time and can see in all directions at once. One notable Priapulin is Charza Kwinn, who assisted Obi-wan Kenobi and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker in their quest to obtain a living starship from the mysterious planet Zonoma Sekot. His ship The Star Sea Flower, a modified C.E.C. YT-1150, has a hyperdrive class of 0.8: a class seldom obtained by a ship in the Old Republic era. Psadan One of the indigenous races of the planet Wayland. This race appeared in the last novel of the Thrawn trilogy by Timothy Zahn. In The Last Command, they are one of the races that the cloned and insane Jedi master Joruus C'baoth kept under his rule at the foot of Mount Tantiss. P'w'eck The P'w'ecks are a warm- blooded, dinosaur-like species similar in appearance to the Ssi-Ruuk but with lower intelligence, smaller size, short tails and drooping eyes. The Ssi-Ruuk have dominated the P'w'ecks for thousands of years, enslaving and controlling their lives. They are used as slaves, guards and beasts of burden and perform the lowest jobs in Ssi-Ruuvi society. Notable P'w'ecks include Lwothin, a leader of the P'w'eck Emancipation Movement. Quarren Quarrens or Qarrens are a species of aquatic humanoids that share the planet of Mon Calamari with another sentient aquatic species, the Mon Calamari, from which the planet is named. The Quarren are also nicknamed \\"squid head\\" around the galaxy due to their resemblance to cephalopods, which Quarren are actually related to. They are more introverted than their neighbors, preferring the deep water to the surface and rarely inviting guests to their domain. They are humanoids with squid-like heads that vaguely resemble Cthulhu. During the Clone Wars, the Quarren Isolation League attempted to isolate Mon Calamari from the rest of the galaxy. They were eventually defeated during the Battle of Mon Calamari where Clone SCUBA troopers under the command of Kit Fisto defeated them and their Separatist allies. Notable Quarren include Tessek, who escaped Mon Calamari to work for Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine and Darth Maleval who served with the 407th on the planet Borosk.Star Wars: Legacy For some reason, they were common leaders in the Exchange during the Old Republic.Video Game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II The Sith Lords, 2005 Quermian A race of sentient vertebrates, related to the Xexto of Troiken, the Quermian are a species native to the planet Quermia. They have two brains (one in the head and another in the chest cavity), a long thin neck, and six spindly limbs. Their sensitive olfactory glands are located in their hands and they are born with a natural talent in telepathy and mind control. Their telepathy is only short range, though. They must be looking at the person in the eye if they are not force sensitive to perform this task.\\"Star Wars Roleplaying Game - Ultimate Alien Anthology\\" guidebook Among the more noticeable of this species would be Jedi Master Yarael Poof. He served on one of the last Jedi High Councils and was present when Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn presented Anakin Skywalker to the Jedi Council for training. Rakata The Rakata are an amphibian-humanoid species from the planet Lehon. They ruled an \\"Infinite Empire\\" of 500 worlds, several thousand years before the formation of the Republic. They are believed to be responsible for Tatooine's desert climate due to their razing of the planet, and Kashyyyk's lush overgrowth from their terraforming. During the travels of Revan (Knights of the Old Republic), it is discovered that this race went into decline due to the combination of a civil war and genetic plague. It is not known exactly when this happened, but around 30,000 years before their discovery they became extinct.Darth Bane: Path of Destruction The Rakata also used their technological skills and knowledge to build a massive space station called the Star Forge. Also a lyric in a song according to Elvia. Ranat Ranats, known as Con Queecon in their own language, were a species of meter-tall rodents with long, tusk-like incisors jutting from their lower jaws. Though originally from Rydar II, the Ranats there were nearly wiped out by Human colonists in 200 BBY. Three Ranats stowed away on a spice freighter and crash landed on Aralia, where they re- established their species. Ranat tribes lived in large, maze-like tunnel networks, where they raised their young communally and lured intruders into dead ends to be killed. Ranats had simple personalities, showing little evidence of emotion beyond the desire for food. Though almost always hostile toward one another, tribes did cooperate to kill pest-control teams after entrepreneurs arrived on Aralia to turn it into a planetary amusement park. The government of the Antemeridian sector declared the Ranats semi-sentient, permitting sentient beings to kill the rodents in self-defense and forbidding them to arm members of the species. The governor restricted the movement of well-armed groups to Aralia to cover up the species' existence and its questionable level of sentience. Few Ranats were seen away from Aralia, and those that left the world occupied the lowest levels of society. Ranats established themselves on Tatooine, where they lived in the more populated areas as scroungers and traders. One group overran crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure's Palace after his death, and the Vriichon brothers once owned the Mos Eisley Cantina. During the Galactic Civil War, the Imperial military tested Ranat mercenary bands for possible use against Rebel Alliance forces. Ranats were also found in the employ of the mage Orloc, who attempted to start his own Jedi Order. The Ranat Rik-tak was a member of the Justice Action Network who operated in the Tapani sector. Ranats were omnivores and strongly preferred meat, especially that of Aralia's native robas. Their sharp incisors and claws were useful as both weapons and tunneling tools. Burrowing wore down their teeth but also released hormones that stimulated tooth growth; unchecked, the incisors could reach prodigious lengths, so most Ranats gnawed constantly to keep them filed back. Ranats were a species of small rodents. They shared many features in common with sentient species such as their distant cousins, the Tintinna,[14] and with other sentient mammals of similar physiology, including Chadra-Fan and Squibs. Nevertheless, the status of Ranats as fully sentient or merely semi-sentient was the subject of galactic debate for centuries. With few exceptions, Ranats stood about a meter high. This small size made them seem innocuous to many who encountered them and belied their power. They had short, well-muscled limbs with four digits on each forepaw and three per hindpaw. All four paws were nimble and capable of fine manipulation. Ranats had short, heavy-duty, retractable claws that, while of limited use in hunting or self-defense, allowed a Ranat to dig through as much as one meter of soil and loose rock in a mere 15 seconds. The Ranat body was tough, wiry, and partially flattened. Exceptional flexibility allowed Ranats to squeeze through small openings that would prove impenetrable to other beings of similar size; the Shi'ido shapeshifter Mammon Hoole often assumed the form of a Ranat to take advantage of this very ability.[20] Although a typical Ranat had a long, scaly, hairless tail, the rodents were almost entirely covered in fur that ranged from dirty blond to dark reddish or grayish brown. Some Ranats groomed themselves, but for most, the coat was filthy and foul-smelling. Understandably, many non-Ranats considered the species to be visually unappealing. Ranats stooped when they stood and scampered and scurried when they ran. They tended to wear little more clothing than cloth hoods, leather belts, and ornamental tooth bands. However, those Ranats who integrated into galactic society often wore full-length tunics and footwear. The Ranats' eyes, located at the sides of the head, varied in color from beady and black, to red. Their hairless, pink ears were small and round and typically lay flat against the head. A Ranat's long, pointed snout was full of sharp teeth and terminated in a yellowish-white nose surrounded by long, black whiskers. Their senses were acute: they could see in the dark and detect others' moods by scent. Ranats spoke in a voice of squeaks and screeches. A Ranat's bottom two incisors were sharp, pointed, and discolored yellow or brown from tartar and dirt. Gnawing stimulated glands in the Ranat's jaw to produce growth hormones. Unchecked, this caused the incisors to grow up to a centimeter in a standard hour. The only way to counter the growth was to gnaw even more and wear the teeth down. Some members of the species managed to keep these teeth small enough to fit inside the mouth, but others had incisors that poked out and overlapped the upper lip like tusks. Coupled with their sharp teeth and powerful jaws, these incisors gave Ranats a dangerous bite. Ranats were fecund. Females went into heat at least twice each standard year, during which period they mated with as many males as possible. After fertilization, the fetuses gestated for about 120 standard days. The mother then gave birth to a litter of three to six young. The species' signature incisors began to grow in at adolescence. Members of the species were considered adults at three standard years of age, and the average Ranat could expect to live to be 20 standard years old. A song from the Max Rebo Band, the fictional band in the Star Wars universe that is playing in Jabba the Hutt's palace in Return of the Jedi, is dedicated to them known as \\"Kick That Ranat\\". Rattataki Native to the planet Rattatak, the Rattataki were noticeable for their pale white skin color. They developed a violent culture, like fierce combat involving gladiators of their homeworld. Asajj Ventress was originally a Rattataki but with the release of season three of the Clone Wars cartoon her back story has been rewritten by the writers of the show and was the most famous member of their species. They're a playable race in Star Wars: The Old Republic.  Rishii  The Rishii are an avian species from the planet Rishii. They have human-like hands at the ends of their wings. They fly at great speeds from cliffs to catch rodents in their talons. Like most avians, the Rishii live in nests built on cliffs. The Rishii are a kind species, but have an ability to mimic other languages, which, at times, is a little annoying to the people they are mimicking. Rodian Doda Bodonawieedo, a Rodian Rodians are a species of green, antenna-sporting, bug-eyed humanoids from the planet Rodia. The Rodians are born hunters; they killed most of the wildlife and grew restless with the lack of creatures and began to hunt each other in gladiatorial combat, until the Republic found them. Many continued to hunt as bounty hunters; the most notable specimen was Greedo, the bounty hunter shot by Han Solo in the Mos Eisley cantina in the original Star Wars movie Star Wars. In the 1997 special edition of Return of the Jedi, two Rodians were added, one named Greeata who served as a dancer in Jabba the Hutt's palace on Tatooine, and Doda Bodonawieedo (picture on right), a member of the Max Rebo Band who plays the flute. A young Rodian named Wald (played by Warwick Davis), a friend of Anakin Skywalker, appears in Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace. In Attack of the Clones, Rodians are represented by Senator Onaconda Farr, and Palpatine's aide Dar Warc. Rodians were one of the species playable in Star Wars: Galaxies. The Hutt colonization of Rodia brought changes to the Rodian race. Old Rodian slowly ceased to be a written and spoken language. Huttese was adopted as the official language and soon came to be spoken by the Rodians. Some Rodians are enlisted in the public service of the Hutts and tend to fare better than others of their race. Any association with the Hutts often brings great rewards but sometimes can bring heavy consequences. Rodians are well suited for the rigors of being a bounty hunter. This is because of their harsh jungle home world, Rodia, and the guerrilla style clan-warfare that they witness (or participate in) on an almost daily basis. Roonan Roonans are a bulbous-headed, almond-eyed alien species from the planet Roona. Notable characters of this race include the Galactic Senate representative Edcel Bar Gane, and the Jedi Knight Halsey. Ruurian Ruurians are like walking, fuzzy Huttlets. Ryn Ryn are a humanoid race. Their bodies are covered in fur that primarily grows in a short fuzz all around, with the exception of their human-like hair and the human-like mustaches on the men. They also have prehensile tails, excellent for grasping things. They are nomadic, with no knowledge of their original homeworld, and are either hated, ignored, or quietly despised in every corner of the Galaxy, notably such areas as the Corporate Sector, are fond of dance, song, and the enjoyment of life. A peculiar habit of theirs is that a Ryn cannot sleep in the same location twice. They apparently once had an impressive warrior tradition on their homeworld, but that was, save for their tendency to fight tenaciously, apparently lost, although sabacc, the popular card game that took the place of Pazaak in terms of card game prominence, is derived from their use of it as a fortune telling tool in their auguries. These auguries are today favored by Hutts, who have a superstitious belief in the card tellings (that may not be entirely unjustified when the Force comes into play.) A Ryn named Droma aided Han Solo in escaping the Jubilee Wheel, a space station in orbit around Ord Mantell, when it was attacked by a Yuuzhun Vong Tizo worm. the two later parted ways only to be reunited later aboard the Queen of Empire. Han later agrees to assist Droma in finding his clan-mates. Saffa The Saffa's main contribution is an important art form, the Saffa paintings, which were created after the Saffa made contact with the Thennqora. This artistic medium reached its height approximately 1550‚Äì2200 BBY (before the battle of Yavin). One of the few mentions of Saffa paintings occurs in Heir to the Empire, where one of them is seen projected around Grand Admiral Thrawn's chair and is mentioned when Thrawn asks Captain Pellaeon what he knows about art. A quick lesson ensues about the importance of art in understanding a species. Sanyassan The Sanyassan Marauders were a savage group of ape-like reptiloids with gray- green skin originally from the planet Sanyassa that crash landed sometime in the past on the forest moon of Endor. They are featured in the movie Ewoks: The Battle for Endor. Led by their brutal leader King Terak, they were always searching for a way to get off Endor. However, their ship was beyond repair since they had destroyed it long ago. Terak thought that a mystical Power would make them rulers of the Galaxy. During a raid on Bright Tree Village, Wicket W. Warrick's hometown, they captured many Ewoks including Wicket. They also captured Cindel Towani and killed the rest of her family. Wicket and Cindel escaped from the marauders' fearsome prison cart and found their way to the home of Noa Briqualon. Eventually the Marauders were defeated and their king killed. They are also featured in the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies. Saurin Saurin are a priestal species, one of the two inhabitant races of the planet Bimmiel.Mollin DL, Ross GIM. The vitamin B12 concentration of serum and urine of normals and patients with megaloblastic anaemia and other diseases. J Clin Pathol 1952;5: 129-39. Selkath Selkath are the native species of the planet Manaan. An aquatic species, they are very good swimmers and have the ability to breathe out of water. They resemble anthropomorphic catfish and have aqua-colored skin. In ancient times, their ancestors were slaves to the Rakata. Their planet has only one city above water, the capital, Ahto City, and it is the position of the Selkath to remain neutral in times of intergalactic conflict. Their laws are very harsh, and it is common for violence or attempts to compromise Manaan's neutrality to be punished by death. But some believed if the Sith won the Jedi Civil War, they would conquer Manaan. So, they made a secret agreement with the Republic to build a facility right at the kolto source. All members of the Selkath race have venom-tipped, retractable claws. Similar to the Wookiees, the use of these claws in any form of combat is considered dishonorable and a sign of madness. A large, female Firaxan Shark, known as the Progenitor, is seen as either a deity, or even an early evolutionary step in the Selkath chain. This belief is similar to that of a mother Earth goddess, or mother \\"ocean\\" goddess in this case. After the events in Knights of the Old Republic, a Force tradition known as the Order of Shasa arose among the Selkath. The population of the Selkath has always been low, even in times of prosperity, but there was a greater proportion of Force-sensitives compared to other species. The members of the Order act as seers, advisers, and elite military leaders in times of war. Their main weapon is a fira, a curved sword, similar to a scimitar, constructed of Cortosis and as part of initiation in the Order of Shasa. Some time after the Battle of the Star Forge, the source of Kolto dried up for reasons unknown and foreign groups abandoned Ahto City and the Selkath. As such, the Selkath gradually reverted to primitive ways, and abandoned Ahto City. When the Empire returned centuries later, Ahto City was revived, but the Selkath were enslaved. As in many other examples of racism and speciesism, the Empire polluted the oceans of Manaan and wrecked the environment. Darth Vader himself (a Sith who was closely connected to Darth Sidious, the Emperor) came to the planet, and soon started a quiet, but bloody, revolt of the Selkath against the Empire. However, he told several Force-sensitive Selkath warriors and Shasan Adepts of when and where to strike the Imperial Stormtrooper patrols. It is currently unknown whether the Empire put down this revolt, left the planet, or didn't even care. Sauvax The Sauvax were a lobster-like sentient species who hail from Leritor. Selonian A furred, burrowing species from the Corellian System, Selonians resemble giant weasels or otters in appearance. Most Selonians are infertile females; one in every 100 is a male, and 5 in 100 are fertile females. Selonians live in clans more akin to insects than mammals, always headed by a female. Although they do possess advanced technology, they usually stay on-planet. Shawda Ubb Shawda Ubb are native to the swamp planet Manpha. Shawda Ubb are short and amphibian- like. The character Rappertunie from Return of the Jedi is the only known member of this race. Shi'ido A rare humanoid shape-shifting species of aliens, not entirely unlike Clawdites, except that they also use mind-clouding abilities to infiltrate cultures. The first Shi'ido introduced in the Star Wars expanded universe was Senior Anthropologist Mammon Hoole, who authored a study of Tatooine in The Illustrated Star Wars Universe, which tells of his impersonating a Jawa and a Tusken Raider. He also featured in the Galaxy of Fear series as the uncle of humans Tash and Zak Arranda, along with Shi'ido Imperial scientist Borborygmus Gog. Shistavanen Colloquially nicknamed \\"wolfmen\\", the Shistavanen are a lupine race native to Uvena Prime, one of many habitable planets in the Uvena system. Their bodies are covered in dark hair and they have intimidating, glowing red eyes and sharp fangs. They have very well developed senses, making them extremely good hunters. Like the Wookiees, the Shistavanen are naturally well-suited to work as scouts, but unlike the Wookiees, are more commonly employed by the Empire. Shistavenens are a very xenophobic race who do not like outsiders interfering with their business. Most Shistavanens are aggressive to other races but some are less xenophobic and more sociable, although they are a minority. The race has not been much developed even in the Expanded Universe, an exception being Rogue Squadron's Riv Shiel, but one is visible in the Mos Eisley cantina in A New Hope. This one, Lak Sivrak, was also at one stage a member of the Rebel Alliance, eventually dying when his X-Wing crash landed on the Forest Moon of Endor. His story is told in \\"Tales From the Mos Eisley Cantina\\" as \\"One Last Night in the Mos Eisley Cantina\\", co-authored by Judith and Garfield Reeves- Stevens. Jedi Master Voolvif Monn is an example of this species. Sikan The Sikans are an alien race native to the planet of Sika. Sith The Sith (also known as Red Sith during the time of the Old Sith Empire and Sith Purebloods during the time of the resurgent Sith Empire) were the native species of the planet Korriban. They had red skin and tentacle 'beards', and had a natural talent for mastering the Force as well as their magic and alchemy. Naturally cruel and manipulative, the Sith spread throughout the outer rim in the early days of the Old Republic, eventually centering their empire on Korriban. Some time after the Great Schism, several refugee Dark Jedi settled on the planet. Amazing the Sith with their mastery of the Force, the fallen Jedi soon elevated themselves to god-like status, becoming the rulers of the Sith. As the centuries passed, interbreeding occurred between the human Dark Jedi and the Sith, creating a half-species with an enormous talent for manipulating the Force. This species, which were also called Sith, had red skin like the original Sith. A prominent member of this half-species was the Sith Lord Marka Ragnos. The name \\"Sith\\" was adopted by their Dark Jedi rulers, and has later been used by numerous fallen Jedi organizations. These new Sith are the primary antagonists in the Star Wars saga. They are a playable race in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game, Star Wars: The Old Republic. The extinct race Sith was the mortal enemy of the extinct race Jedi. According to the codex in Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, both races drove each other to extinction, but not before spawning groups that copied and continued their ideals (the new \\"Sith\\" and the \\"Jedi Knights\\"). Naga Sadow was another pureblooded sith. His apprentice Freedon Nadd was Human. Skakoan The atmosphere in Skako is extremely dense, so Skakoans evolved to survive under great pressures. When a Skakoan leaves Skako, he/she decompresses and dies in any low-pressure environment. Thus, they wear special protective suits. Very few non-Skakoans have seen a Skakoan without the suit. The Skakoans were relatively unknown in the galaxy, except for their control of the Techno Union, an important union of engineers and scientists. The most notable Skakoan is Wat Tambor, Foreman of the Techno Union. Sneevel A very scarce species, Sneevels are medium-sized creatures that have the nose of a pig, fangs, and a werewolf body. So far, Boles Roor is the only known Sneevel. Snivvian Coming from Cadomai Prime, Snivvians are short humanoids with protruding jaws and short fangs, sometimes called Snaggletooths (two versions of a Snivvian action figure dubbed Snaggletooth were produced for Kenner's Star Wars action figure line in 1978, based on a Snivvian character seen in Mos Eisley's Chalmun's Cantina). Snivvians come from a cold world and have thick skin instead of fur. They are excellent scouts and trackers, and also obsessive artists. Frequently, a Snivvian author will research his or her characters to an extreme level, sometimes with great risk. When twin males are born, one of them is always a psychotic genius, so they try to control their genetics. They are a race similar in feature to Trandoshans and considered a sociopathic species. Squib A species from Skor II, Squibs are known for collecting knickknacks and for their love of trading/haggling. These fox-like creatures stand about a meter tall, with large, doe-like eyes and short fur ranging from red to blue in color. The Squibs evolved on Skor II, a world blessed with nearly limitless resources. These resources, however, were widely distributed across the planet. Consequently, the Squibs developed a sophisticated system of barter and trade as different Squib tribes exchanged goods with one another. Another interesting evolutionary trait is the Squib fur, which acts as a taste and smell receptor, enables a Squib to examine an object by touching it and rubbing it against his or her fur. Squibs are generally confident, gregarious, and annoyingly curious. They tend to run into a situation to examine virtually anything without any regard to possible danger to themselves. Their fast-paced metabolisms make them a bundle of energy, and they are often regarded as flighty by other beings. Their spaceships are built from recycled materials and utilize superior tractor beam technology to wield balls of refuse as both sword and shield. Ssi-Ruuk The Ssi-Ruuk are a saurian race that invade from the Unknown Regions of the galaxy. This was around 4 ABY (After the Battle of Yavin), immediately following Return of the Jedi, in the novel The Truce at Bakura. Native to the planet Lwhekk, Ssi-Ruuk are warm-blooded, reptilian beings covered with scales of various colors. Their blunt, oversized heads end with beaked mouths, and their bodies end with muscular tails. They have clawed hands and feet, and strongly-muscled hind legs. Their skin is so thick that it can withstand blaster shots with only minor burns to show for it. They are blind to the Force, and communicate with each other via a complex series of tweets and whistles. They also have scent tongues which they eject from their nostrils. Each hand has three opposable claws. They all have three eyelids. As a rule, the Ssi-ruuk were highly xenophobic, but were more disgusted by other species than afraid of them. Their religion greatly fears death on any planet that has not been \\"sanctified.\\" As a result, they rely on a technology called entechment that involved capturing the life-energy of beings and using them as power sources. Entechment allows them to use unmanned spaceships for the majority of their combat. Stereb The Stereb were a race of primitive, red- skinned near-humans who once inhabited the world of Serocco. While they do not appear in any media, their story is told in detail in Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords. The Stereb possessed primitive technology and built many simple cities across their world. They coexisted with the human population of Serocco until their race was completely destroyed by the Mandalorians' nuclear weapons during the Battle of Serocco. Sullustan A Sullustan is a native of the Sullust system. They are short, mouse-eared humanoids with large eyes and mouth-folds, known primarily as merchants and engineers. The Sullustans live in vast caves on the planet Sullust. Most Sullustans work for the Sorusuub Corporation. The majority of those that have found their way off-world work as starship crew. They have a reputation for excellence and intuition for piloting, which has mostly been earned through simple hard work, although as a race they possess perfect direction sense and memory thanks to spending their lives inside the pitch black caves and tunnels that run through Sullust. This allows them to remember any paths they have traveled, or maps they have seen, making them excellent navigators. In the Star Wars films, Sullustans make no appearance prior to Return of the Jedi (1983), where the most prominent member of the species seen on-screen, Nien Nunb, is Lando Calrissian's co-pilot in the Millennium Falcon as it attacks the Death Star. A secondary Sullustan character was called Ten Nunb and was present at the briefing led by Mon Mothma, Admiral Ackbar, and General Madine, who was a B-wing pilot in the Rebel Alliance. He was killed by General Weir in the non-canonical comic series X-Wing: Rogue Leader published by Dark Horse Comics. According to the Star Wars Insider #67, p. 31, \\"Ben Burtt used the real-world language Haya, a Kenyan dialect for Nunb's Sullustan dialogue.\\" In the Star Wars expanded universe, there is also the X-wing pilot Aril Nunb, a member of Rogue Squadron. Jae Juun is a freighter pilot, also from the Star Wars expanded universe. When first introduced (in The Joiner King), he pilots a Correllian freighter in the same class as the Millennium Falcon. His co- pilot is an Ewok named Tarfang. He later pilots the DR-909, and he and Tarfang help Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa, and their friends on their various exploits. The two of them run spinglass busts and sculptures for the Saras nest, and would have gotten into trouble with the Galactic Alliance government when it was discovered that these busts contained Gorog assassin bugs, had it not been for the intervention of Luke Skywalker and Han Solo, who spoke to the Fifth Fleet admiral on their behalf, informing him of their innocence in the matter and their determination to right the wrong once it was discovered. Jae Juun and Tarfang are then employed as Intelligence agents by the Galactic Alliance. Sullustans are also a playable race in Star Wars Galaxies. Talortai The Talortai, a Force-sensitive sentient species from the planet Talor, had some avian and reptilian characteristics. Tyber Zann's bodyguard Urai Fen was a member of the species. Talpini The Talpini are a species from world of Tal Pi. There small size lets them conceal themselves easily among taller or bigger individuals. Weeteef Cyubee (played by Warwick Davis in Rogue One) was a member of this species. Talz The Talz are a furry race with two distinct sets of eyes: one for day vision, and one for night vision. They are generally peaceful and pacifistic creatures, but were forced into slave labor by the Empire. Foul Moudama was a Talz Jedi Knight who died protecting Chancellor Palpatine from General Grievous. Another notable Talz is Muftak from the book Tales From The Mos Eisley Cantina. In his story, he and a Chadra-Fan named Kabe pillage Jabba's townhouse in Mos Eisley, but get caught and Muftak sacrifices himself for Kabe to escape and make a living with the money and jewels that they stole from Jabba's house, but Kabe goes back to save him, and in the process the sack of money and jewels gets stolen. Another notable Talz is Broonmark who served the Emperor's Wrath in the Cold War. They make an appearance in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, the TV series. Tarasin Tarasin are chameleon-like species that can communicate silently by fluctuating skin color. Taung The Taung were early people of the capital planet of the Galactic Republic, Coruscant. They were the early ancestors of the Mando'a speaking Mandalorians. The Mandalorians inhabited Coruscant long before humans did. They battled the Zhell people (former humans) and the Mandalorians were driven out of the planet by a volcanic explosion which created a massive dust cloud. They also have a healing trait that far surpasses most other races, including ones like the Gen‚Äôdai and such, which they used to aid them in leading the Mandalorians off of their planet. Though most of the Mandalorians were thought to be driven out, some were rumored to have stayed behind and live amongst them. Tauntaun Tauntauns appear in The Empire Strikes Back as furry bipedal mounts the Rebels ride to patrol the planet Hoth in the vicinity of their hidden stronghold, Echo Base. Han Solo complained that tauntauns smelled bad, and that their innards smelled worse. One appears in the center of this movie poster for the film. Tchuukthai The Tchuukthai, also called Wharls, are quadrupedal predators from an undiscovered planet. They are sentient, but most people in the galaxy consider them to be mere legendary beasts. The secretive Tchuukthai do nothing to discourage this belief; if anything, they enhance it with their displays of ferocity. The Tchuukthai are unable to speak Galactic Basic, and very few are ever seen off their home planet. Jedi Master Thon was a Tchuukthai. Teek Teeks are rodentlike, simian creatures that live in the forest moon of Endor. They were first mentioned in The Illustrated Star Wars Universe book and one appeared in the movie Ewoks: The Battle for Endor. They have a reputation of scavenging and stealing from animal nests and Ewok dwellings. Teeks have long, pointed ears, scruffy white fur, and beady black eyes. They communicate by constant chattering. They wear clothes with many belts, pouches and pockets for the things they have managed to steal. They are also distinguished for running at stunning speed, almost moving too fast for the human eye to see. Teevan Teevans are a flexible species. One famous Teevan was Tru Veld. Terentatek Terentatek originally evolved on Korriban, where the power and presence of the dark side gradually distorted their shapes and corrupted their minds. Some sources, however, say that they were first created on Yavin 4 by Exar Kun, as one of his experiments in 3,997 BBY. It is possible that terentateks are highly altered rancors undergoing many experiments. Regardless, terentatek's hide was immune to effects of the Force. They became the most dangerous of the creatures bred by the Sith. They were so powerful and dangerous to the Jedi, that they were often dubbed Jedi Killers. During an event known as the Great Hunt, numerous Jedi traveled throughout the galaxy to try to exterminate the terentatek. Jedi were often sent in groups of two or three to battle these beasts, and the Jedi of the group had a strong Force bond between them. This was done so that the group could strengthen itself from the dark influence prevalent in the lairs of the terentatek, and as it had to rely on its weaponry skills alone due to the almost complete Force immunity of the terentatek. None of the hunts were successful, however. Even though the Jedi seemingly exterminated a majority of the terentatek each time, the waxing of the dark side would trigger the terentatek to come out of hibernation and repopulate the galaxy. Such events included the rise to power of Revan, Malak, and Emperor Palpatine. Terentatek were also found on Tatooine, Kashyyyk, Onderon, Tython, and Yavin 4. During the Jedi Civil War, Revan and his companions found and killed a terentatek in Kashyyyk's Shadowlands while searching for the Star Forge. It had been a ceremonial beast used in an old Wookiee ritual. In one such ritual many years ago, Bacca's Ceremonial Blade had broken from its hilt and become embedded in the creature's flesh when a headstrong Wookiee chieftain had attempted to slay it‚Äîthe blade was recovered by Revan. Revan also single-handedly fought and killed two terentateks in the tomb of Naga Sadow. There was also a terentatek in the Shyrak Caves on Korriban, which turned out to be near the entrance to the tomb of Ludo Kressh. Thakwaash An equine-humanoid species, the Thakwaash reside on the world of Thakwaa. The entire Thakwaash race is afflicted with a form of dissociative identity disorder Each member possesses multiple 'minds'; each of these minds (and associated personalities) controlling a different skill or talent. The most notable member of the Thakwaash race is Wraith Squadron pilot Hohass \\"Runt\\" Ekwesh.  Theelin  Theelin are a fictional race from the Star Wars saga. They are a humanoid race and individual members have different skin and hair colors. Ryst√°ll is half Theelin (her mother is human). Thennqora This species influenced Saffa paintings after their initial contact several millennia ago. Tiss'shar The Tiss'shar were a Velociraptor-looking sentient species that come from Tiss'sharl. Thisspiasian Thisspiasians are a sentient serpentine species from the planet Thisspias. Master Oppo Rancisis, who sat on the Jedi Council during the Clone Wars, is the only example of a character of this species in the films. Thrella An extinct species from Mimban, mentioned in the novel Splinter of the Mind's Eye. They were the builders of the Temple of Pomojema. Timoliini An extremely rare species from Mimban, this species lives in the southern swamps. Timoliini is known for its filthy eating habits and yellow- green skin. The species communicates by loud, high-pitched squeaks, sometimes as loud as 140 Decibels. Timoliinis live alone, are rarely seen in packs, and are highly anti-social. Little is known of the species. It has been speculated that a Timoliini can be seen in Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith, in the background in a Twilek's cage. T'landa Til A race of quadrupedal aliens with delicate, frail arms, they are a distant cousin of the Hutt species. T'landa Til males have developed a genetic ability to attract females of their kind, which as a byproduct produces powerful, addictive physical and mental waves of pleasure in most humanoid races. The Hutts have been known to exploit this ability for the slave trade. The T'landa Til are developed in A.C. Crispin's Han Solo trilogy. Tof Green-skinned humanoids from planet Tof, beyond the Galactic Rim, they are considered to be devoid of morals, compassion, or patience. They were ruled by monarchs, who usually possessed military experience. They are natural enemies of the Nagai and both species are usually at war. Togorian Togorians are the felinoid inhabitants of Togoria. Most of them over two metres tall, the beings are covered with fur and have long slender muscles. They are described in A. C. Crispin's The Paradise Snare as very tall panther-like creatures. A Togorian male spends most of his time hunting, in pursuit of prey, they are known to use reptilian mosgoths as mounts. Once a year, male Togorians return to their city homes to mate. Female Togorians are famed for their technological proficiency. Male Togorians are often employed as pirates or bounty hunters due to their great size and power. Male Togorians will occasionally scatter crystal fragments in their thick fur, to dazzle their opponents. Notable Togorians include Frrash, Muuurgh and Mrrov. Muurgh met Han Solo while searching for his lost love among spice traders of Ylesia. At least one of the Vigos of the Black Sun criminal organization, killed by Darth Maul, was Togorian. The Togorians are known to have once been the barbaric pirates of the galaxy. Togruta Cosplay of a Togruta, Ahsoka Tano. The Togruta are species from the planet Shili.(Star Wars Role-playing Game: Power of the Jedi Sourcebook p. 75) They are a humanoid race distinguished by their three, and rarely 4, lekku (similar to those of Twi'leks, and more commonly called 'head tails'), which are striped to help them blend in with their natural surroundings and act as an erogenous zone. Colors of Togrutas range from red (most common), to orange, yellow, blue, and even white. Togruta possess a form of passive acoustic echolocation by means of their hollow montrals, which allows them to sense space and the proximity and movement of physical objects around them. Togruta work well in large groups, and individualism is seen as abnormal within their culture. They are also famous for their beauty. Jedi Master Shaak Ti and Anakin Skywalker's young Padawan Ahsoka Tano (The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels) are Togruta. Toong The Toong are a race of yellowish-skinned bipeds who sport large heads with no neck, gangly limbs and three antennae. They are timid and nervous by nature, and prefer to avoid confrontations. One notable Toong is the Podracer Ben Quadinaros. Toydarian Toydaria is a swampy world in Hutt Space. The Toydarians are short, blue-skinned mammals, with generally fat bodies and trunk-like snouts. According to The Science of Star Wars, their stomachs are full of helium, allowing them to fly when flapping their leathery wings. They have trunks on their faces that rest above their short tusks. A Toydarian's thin legs end in webbed feet and the males of the species usually show sparse whiskers on their chin and throat, giving them an unshaven appearance. They are immune to every mind trick caused by the Force (As stated by Watto: \\"I'm a Toydarian! Mind tricks don't work on me - only money!\\"). Watto, a slaver who owned Anakin Skywalker, is a Toydarian, as is Reti, a starfighter pilot in the Starfighter series of games. Air traffic is strictly regulated on Toydaria as the Toydarians all fly around the planet and rarely use vehicles. There are trains on the planet for other travelers. Trandoshan A Trandoshan from Star Wars Galaxies.Trandoshan are large, carnivorous, reptilian humanoids from the planet Trandosha (or Dosha), they have supersensitive eyes that can see into the infrared range and the ability to regenerate lost limbs. They also shed their skin. The Trandoshans are a warlike species who allied early with the Empire and the Confederacy during the Clone Wars, taking Wookiees as slaves. They are the natural enemies of Wookiees, and both Wookiees and Trandoshans keep each other's dried skins and pelts as prizes. As of the original Star Wars races book, their world of origin (Trandoshan or Dosha) occupies the same stellar system as Kashyyyk (the Wookiee homeworld), and it is this proximity that is the source of much of their enmity for the Wookiee race. Unconfirmed speculation suggests that the short-lived Trandoshani overcame their natural limitations as tool users and their harsh homeworld environment to achieve limited space flight on their own, only to discover that the only other inhabited world in their system was a lush, verdant, prey-rich paradise filled with long-lived and technologically unsophisticated savages, and that they've never quite gotten over their pique. Trandoshan religion consists mainly of trying to score enough Jagannath points (The name appears to derive from Jagannath, a deity from Vaishnavism), earned through bounty-hunting or slavery-based kills, to appease the main goddess, or Scorekeeper. Thus, many Trandoshans are bounty hunters or slavers, operating both inside and outside the boundaries of the law. They take particular pleasure in skinning Wookiees for their pelts. A notable Trandoshan is Bossk, who had a cameo role in the movies and is a longtime enemy of both Han Solo and Chewbacca the Wookiee. The race was playable in Star Wars Galaxies, but were unable to wear most footwear or gloves. They also feature in the computer game Republic Commando, where a force of Trandoshan mercenaries take over a Republic ship, and in the Knights of the Old Republic series (particularly in II, where on the world of Nar Shaddaa an elderly Trandoshan can be conversed with for an extended philosophical debate). Bossk is also a playable character in the Real Time Strategy game Star Wars: Empire at War as part of the Forces of Corruption expansion pack. In Star Wars: The Old Republic, Qyzen Fess is an attainable Trandoshan companion character. Two examples of Trandoshans are Dar and his father and the leader of the Trandoshans, Garnac. Trianii An advanced, adventurous feline species, the Trianii inhabit the outermost portion of the Corporate Sector Authority. In many ways they are similar to the Togorians, Cathar, and Catuman Warriors. Unlike these other feline species, however, Trianii have prehensile tails and their more agile figures are perfect for leaping, jumping, and acrobatics. Like most feline species Trianii have excellent balance and eyesight. Their sleek fur comes in a wide range of colors and patterns. Trian, the Trianii home planet, and its six colony worlds were the target of an attempted annexation by the Corporate Sector Authority. This annexation was repelled by the Trianii and their renowned Rangers and the Trianii remained independent and unhindered throughout the rise and fall of the Empire. Trogodile The Trogodiles were a race of crocodilian-like species of Rattatak. They first appeared in Star Wars: Clone Wars. Troig A two-headed, four limbed species that inhabit the planet Pollillus. They were discovered shortly before the Battle of Naboo. The Troig Fodesinbeed commentated during the Boonta Eve podrace that won Anakin Skywalker's freedom. Tunroth The Tunroth are bipedal sentients indigenous to the Jiroch system of the Mid Rim. Towering and physically strong, Tunroth have distinctive elongated heads, a vertical nostril at the top of the skull, and three-digit hands and feet. Widely spaced eyes and sharp horns that line the chin constituted other distinct physical features. The species is renowned throughout the galaxy for their hunting and tracking skills. They have an innate ability to track a quarry, and over time, an elite association known as the Tunroth Hunters came into demand for employment as bounty hunters and big- game hunters. The fact that the Tunroth maintained their use of sacred hunting weapons such as the klirun bow and the kilter staff even after galactic- standard blasters became available to them attested to the religious importance the Tunroth placed on hunter traditions. Each Tunroth community was ruled by the greatest hunter present. Aggressive and hard-working, Tunroth had a tendency to intimidate members of other species. The Tunroth were members of the Galactic Republic for thousands of years. After first contact with outsiders, the species spread to other habitable planets in their system. In 7 BBY, during the reign of the Galactic Empire, Lortan fanatics virtually wiped them out in an onslaught known as the Reslian Purge. The Empire intervened to save the Tunroth from total annihilation, and the Tunroth came to greatly respect the galactic government. The species slowly recovered, as expatriate Tunroth returned home to help rebuild their civilization. The system joined the Empire, although some members resisted the Emperor's anti-alien policies as members of the Rebel Alliance. After the transition from Galactic Empire to New Republic, the Tunroth remained wary of the new government but eventually joined it. Tusken Raider Often referred to as Sand People (or \\"Tuskens\\"), these nomadic desert inhabitants roam the Jundland Wastes on the planet Tatooine, and play a major role in Anakin Skywalker's backstory. Twi'lek Oola, a Twi'lek. Twi'leks are humanoids easily distinguished by the twin tentacular appendages that protrude from the back of the head. These prehensile appendages, known as \\"head-tails\\", \\"lekku\\" or \\"tchun-tchin,\\" are advanced organs used for communication and cognitive functions (similar to those of Togrutas). The Twi'lek's name means Twin Lekku. Like humans, Twi'leks vary greatly in appearance and have a wide variety of skin colors including shades of white, blue, green and red. Twi'leks stand between 1.6 and 2.1 meters tall.Star Wars Ultimate Alien Anthology, page 172. Twi'leks speak Twi'leki, a language that combines verbal components with subtle head-tail movements. When they wish, they can even communicate in complete secrecy using their versatile head-tails. Young female Twi'leks are graceful and beautiful, and are highly sought as dancers or slaves, often sold by their own family members for profit. Twi'leks are native to mountainous Ryloth in the Outer Rim. Twi'lek Cosplayer Legends Because of Ryloth's synchronous rotation, half of the world is trapped in perpetual darkness, while the other half remains scorched by the sun. The Twi'leks inhabit a thin band of twilight between these two extremes, living in sprawling catacomb cities just below the planet's surface. They have a relatively primitive industrial civilization, and survive on a diet of raw fungi and cow-like rycrits. Because Ryloth is relatively defenseless, the planet has long been the target of off-world slavers. Twi'leks adhere to a familial clan government organized around a series of head clans with their own city on Ryloth, each consisting of five members who are born into the position. Head clans are responsible for all community decisions, but the position also has a heavy price: When one member of a clan government dies, the remaining four leaders are exiled into Ryloth's uninhabitable Bright Lands, allowing the next generation of clan leaders to assume their rightful place. Religiously, the species worships a single female deity. Ryloth's harsh environment and turbulent history have forged Twi'leks into tough survivors. Twi'leks are calculating and pragmatic and try their best to avoid getting involved in other beings' conflicts, preferring instead to stay out of the way and wait out conflicts in relative safety where they can watch, plan, and prepare to make a profit from the outcome. Generally nonviolent, they typically use their intelligence and cunning to achieve their goals or resolve conflicts. Noble Twi'leks may seem stoic or even aloof, while less scrupulous members of the species can be considered ruthless and manipulative. Canon In Star Wars: The Clone Wars, when the Separatists captured Ryloth, two clones found a young Twi'lek named Numa, who took them around Ryloth and showed them her destroyed home. After the clones removed their helmets to prove they were humans and not droids, she started calling them \\"Nara\\". When the clones asked Obi-Wan Kenobi what that meant he replied, \\"Nara, it means brother.\\" In Star Wars Rebels it is revealed that Numa has joined Hera Syndulla's father (Cha m Syndulla, who was also helping the clones years ago) in an anti-imperial resistance group, and has donned the names of the two clones on her armor (Waxer and Boil). Twi'leks are given French accents at the behest of George Lucas, as homage to the French Resistance during WWII. Known Twi'leks Jedi Knight Aayla Secura (Battlefront II) and Master Zhar Lestin (Knights of the Old Republic) are Twi'leks. Rianna Saren in the video game Star Wars: Lethal Alliance is a Twi'lek. Twi'lek were one of the species playable in Star Wars: Galaxies, where they were given bonuses in the Entertainer skillset. Twi'leks such as Bib Fortuna and Oola were first seen in Jabba the Hutt's lair in Return of the Jedi (1983). Lyn Me was digitally added to the scenes in the Special Edition (1997). Twi'leks are never named in the Star Wars movies, and in the game Star Wars: X-Wing there is a planet called Twi'lek, most likely Ryloth. Game designers Bill Slavicsek and Grant Boucher invented the name Twi'lek for the Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope supplement for the 'Star Wars role-playing game from West End Games. BioWare's 2003 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic features the young Twi'lek Mission Vao who accompanied the player on his search for the Star Forge 3956 BBY together with her Wookiee friend Zaalbar. The 2011 MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic, also by BioWare, features Vette, a Twi'lek pirate who is a companion character and slave to the Sith Warrior. In Michael A. Stackpole's award-winning X-wing series, a Twi'lek pilot named Nawara Ven is a former Imperial defense attorney who defected to the New Republic when he was unable to seek justice for his clients in Palpatine's humanocentric court system. In Rogue Squadron, Ven makes his first appearance as an X-wing pilot in the squadron reorganized by Commander Wedge Antilles. In Wedge's Gamble, he assists the Republic in retaking the galactic capital Coruscant. In The Krytos Trap, Ven defends Captain Tycho Celchu, when he is charged with treason and the murder of Lieutenant Corran Horn. In The Bacta War, Ven is injured in battle and he retires from piloting. In the end, he becomes the squadron's executive officer. In Star Wars Rebels Hera Syndulla is a Twi'lek who pilots the Ghost. She is the daughter of Cham Syndulla, a character who first appeared in The Clone Wars animated series.

He achieved notability for appearing in three seasons of Project Runway. He is also known for achieving the same place (12th) 3 times. Biography His father, Alejandro Franco was born in Lima, Peru. His mother, Maria Franco was born in El Salvador. Daniel Franco is fluent in English and Spanish. Between 1977-1984 Franco was cast as the principal lead in 16 different television commercial campaigns promoting brands such as McDonald's, Tang & Raisin Bran Cereal. He starred in the PBS program \\"Villa Alegre\\", a Spanish version of Sesame Street for 2 seasons between 1977-1979. In 1980, Daniel Franco was cast as a recurring character on CBS soap opera \\"The Young & The Restless\\" for 1 season, as an illegitimate child of a regular cast member. Franco holds both a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Otis College of Art and Design and an Associate Arts degree in fashion design from the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles. In 1995, Franco received critical acclaim when he was voted Best Designer in a nationwide contest for fashion students by The Fashion Group International. He received top honors in both the career and the leisure categories. By 1999 he had broadened his design experience by working in New York City as a fashion forecaster for a company called Here & There Int., assisting Richard Tyler and designing for BCBG twice. He worked for BCBG in 1997 and again in 2007. Also in 1999, Franco designed his first clothing line, which was sold exclusively through Saks Fifth Avenue. He took a five-year hiatus from the fashion industry to run his family's business, The Albertson Wedding Chapel on Miracle Mile, Los Angeles, CA, when his father had 2 debilitating strokes and took ill. Not only did Franco deal with his father's illness but Franco also suffered M√©ni√®re's disease during this time. Shortly after his recovery he returned to the fashion world as a contestant on the first season of Project Runway. His experience on the show inspired him to relaunch the Daniel Franco collection with his first fashion show. His debut was well received by buyers, media and critics alike, which motivated him to return to television for another chance at Project Runway season two. Daniel Franco also created a collection for LA Fashion week in the fall of 2005 as well as New York fashion week in 2007. Franco auditioned for FOX's American Idol in Season 9, but did not make the age cutoff. He was featured during the Adam Lambert lookalike montage.http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/01/27/daniel- franco-american-idol/ Project Runway Franco appeared on seasons 1 and 2. During Season 1, he was out on the first episode (the challenge for that episode was to create a sexy, glamorous outfit for a night on the town made only from materials bought at a Manhattan supermarket). However, he returned on the second season. He had one of the lowest scores during the first episode (The designers were given six yards of plain white muslin, $20 and 1 week to create an outfit that best represents who they are as a fashion designer). He had one of the highest scores for the second episode's challenge (create an outfit using the clothes the designers are wearing at the time the challenge is announced), but he was out by the fourth episode (that episode's challenge was to create a lingerie line of 3 looks in groups of 3.) Franco famously stated, \\"I love you, Heidi,\\" to host Heidi Klum on the Season 2 reunion episode. He has recently been announced as a contestant on the fifth season of Project Runway: All Stars.

Star Wars is an American epic space opera film series created by George Lucas. The first film in the series, Star Wars, was released on May 25, 1977 and became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon, followed by five sequels and three prequels. Many species of alien creatures (often humanoid) are depicted.Yoda‚Äôs species is referred to as ‚ÄúTridactyls‚Äù although the name has never been confirmed in StarWars Ubese Ubese are humanoid creatures that are primarily called on as mercenaries or bounty hunters. Normally, they are a very aggressive people. The Ubese's home world is unknown, and was supposedly heavily bombarded by Republic warships in ancient times. The Republic attacked in a preemptive strike due to aggressive weapon development programs on Ubese worlds. The bombardments destroyed the weapon stockpiles, destroying Uba I outright and poisoning Uba II, Uba III and Uba V. Only Uba IV remained somewhat viable, although the toxic atmosphere requires that the Ubese wear environment suits outdoors. Ubese tend to be very secretive, associating only within their own circles. They have a very distinct hatred for Jedi, believing they destroyed their homeworld; thus they train with Cortosis weapons, items that can resist lightsabers. During the events of Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, they were employed by an Exchange thug to kill the Jedi Exile. The typical Ubese wears a protective, airtight environment suit, and is armed with usually a double bladed vibrosword. The armor they wear In Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is black with a little shine, their faces are not visible due to the helmets they prefer to wear. Princess Leia was disguised as the Ubese bounty hunter Boushh in the beginning of Return of the Jedi. Ubese language is simply called Ubese. Ugnaught Ugnaughts are a race of workers and scavengers that appear in The Empire Strikes Back, the 2014 TV show Star Wars Rebels, and the 2019 TV show The Mandalorian, as well as in the games Jedi Knight, Jedi Knight II, Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, Star Wars: The Old Republic and the novel Boba Fett: Crossfire. They are short in stature with pig-like faces. Umbaran Umbarans reside on the dark world of Umbara deep within the Ghost Nebula. Umbarans have the ability to subtly influence or control people easily. They also see in ultraviolet spectrums. Umbarans very closely resemble humans, but with pale, bluish skin and colorless eyes. Sly Moore, Chancellor Palpatine's staff aide, is an Umbaran. Unu Unu is the name given to the main nest or hive of Killiks, an all-female race of hive mind insectoid amazons. Unu was the hive that took in injured Jedi Raynar Thul after he crash-landed on their world. Raynar eventually became UnuThul, leader of the Killiks (name from the hive's name, 'Unu' and Raynar's last name, 'Thul'). Any part of the old Raynar Thul's mind was either destroyed or buried in his own mind. The Unu and Killiks are introduced in The Dark Nest trilogy by Troy Denning, part of the Star Wars expanded universe. Utai The Utai are one of the two races native to the planet Utapau. They have long eyestalks, a short body structure, two toes per foot, four fingers per hand, and brown eyes that are well adapted to dark conditions. The Utai are also known as Shorts, due to both their short stature and brief lives. They are native to the sinkholes of their home planet, being the first to colonize the walls and crevices. They are primarily working-class people, responsible for large aquaculture plots and domesticating several creatures for use as transports and beasts of burden. Utai society exists side by side with that of the gaunt Pau'an. They have only been seen in Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith. Where the Pau'ans are tall and thin, their Utai cousins are generally short and chubby. Utai have pale, hairless skin and large, oblong heads. Two glassy black eyes protrude on thick stalks from the Utai's face, which is otherwise unremarkable, aside from a small, puckered mouth. Utai have stubby, four-fingered hands and are capable workers and mechanics. An age ago, the Utai were the sole inhabitants of Utapau's plummeting sinkholes, living in dwellings nestled among the crevices of the rocky walls. A planetary climate change forced Utapau's other primary species, the Pau'ans, to migrate underground. The two species formed a mutually beneficial society, merging their disparate civilizations and generally living in peace. A natural hierarchy formed, with the Pau'ans well placed as the rulers and politicians of the Utapaun cities, while the more hands-on Utai served as labourers and workers. Utai also serve as the keepers of the varactyl‚Äîsuper-fast lizard beasts used as mounts on Utapau‚Äîand over the years have learned how to tame the creatures. The Utai were completely CG in the movie. Utapaun The native inhabitants of Utapau can be divided into two distinct species. The taller, more highly evolved Pau'ans have deeply lined, ash-colored faces, gaunt builds, and wear thick, tightly fitting clothes. The smaller Utai make up the working class. They have rounded faces with distended eyes, and have a short, stocky build. Vaathkree This species evolved on the planet of Vaathkree. They seem to be made of stone and metal, but it is only an armor- like covering. They are known for their religion, centered on bartering. Vagaari The Vagaari were a humanoid species from the Unknown Regions. They were a race of nomadic conquerors and slavers that ruled a considerable area in the Unknown Regions. They were led by the Miskara, who was probably a chieftain. Their clothing usually included robes of progressively fancy design and large masks intended to compensate for their height. Their government was the Vagaari Empire. They appear in Outbound Flight and Survivor's Quest. Veknoid Veknoids, also known as Velkoids, were a species native to the planet Moonus Mandel. The famous podracer Teemto Pagalies was a Veknoid, as was the Jedi Master Zao. Vella Vella are the amphibious humainoid inhabitants of the planet Velreone. Verpine The Verpine inhabit the Roche asteroid field and run the aerospace engineering company Slayn & Korpil. Verpine are characterized by their bipedal, wingless bodies and their unusual ability to communicate with each other via organic short l-wave radio transmissions originating from their antenna. They also have vision which enables them to view microscopic fractures and stresses, which is one of the reasons they make excellent mechanic and repair crews. With Admiral Ackbar, they designed the B-wing. They have an egalitarian, completely democratized society.Until recently, the Verpine do not play a significant part in any of the Star Wars movies or novels, but several of their devices do appear in the video game series Knights of the Old Republic as well as in Star Wars novels. These devices seem to be almost exclusively weaponry or arms-related and include a wide array of hand-held projectiles that can alternatively function as shotguns, sniper rifles, high-power assault rifles and fully automatic machine guns. However, in Karen Traviss' book Sacrifice, they approached Boba Fett with offers of a protection agreement, wherein Verpine technology would be combined with Mandalorian iron to produce unmatched weaponry. Fett agrees, and through the book it is apparent that as opposed to being equals, the Verpine fall more under a Mandalorian sphere of influence. The Verpine initiate the terms of the treaty when an argument with the Murkhanan over patents is ignored by the New Republic. Jacen Solo ordered part of a fleet to patrol the space between planets, arguably to get a look at the new Mandalorian fighter, the Bes'uliik, and also setting up a possible Mandalorian/Republic conflict. The book ends with Boba Fett leading a strike force of Bes'ulikks to bomb a series of Murkhanan industrial areas, and to announce that the Mandalorians have returned. Vodran The Vodrans are a species of 1.8-meter-tall humanoid reptiles, with tough skin ranging in coloration from olive to brown, and a small frame of spiny horns around their faces. Though warm-blooded, they laid reptilian eggs, with an egg clutch typically producing two or three Vodran young. They were native to the planet Vodran on the fringes of the Si'klaata Cluster. Before the founding of the Galactic Republic, the Vodrans were approached by Dojundo the Hutt, an emissary from the Hutt Empire, to recruit the Vodrans for the Hutts' war with the legendary Xim the Despot. The Vodrans, believing the Hutts to be evil deities, agreed to serve the Hutts. Their presence, along with those of the Weequay, Klatooinians and Nikto, was instrumental in the defeat of Xim's army of war droids at the Third Battle of Vontor. After the victory at Vontor, the Hutts had the Vodran representative, Kl'ieutu Mutela, along with the representatives of the Klatooinans, Weequay and Nikto, sign themselves into \\"eternal\\" servitude, which the Vodran fulfilled faithfully. In time, Vodrans adopted Hutt culture as their own. Their society was organized into miniature kajidics, and their family clans answered directly to the Hutt Clan of Ancients. Their dealings with the rest of the galaxy always went through their Hutt masters. Vor The Vor are a pterosaur-like species that live on the planet Vortex. The Vor tend not to use extreme force when dealing with foreign threats, but instead rely on their superior morality with their strong reason and intellect. Voxyn The Voxyn are a reptilian species known for their ferocious defense mechanisms. As well as being extremely agile, they bear poisonous spinal bristles, spit a strong acid (brown in color), and have a screech noted to cause bleeding of the ears in some of the hummanoid characters. These vicious creatures were created by the Yuuzhan Vong during the \\"New Jedi Order\\" time period to hunt and kill Jedi. There is little more known about the creatures due to a limited appearance in the novel Star by Star by Troy Denning. Vratix The Vratix are native to the planet of Thyferra. They are essential in the creation of the healing fluid bacta. They perfected the creation of bacta by combining alazhi and kavam. They vastly outnumber the human natives of the planet, but are considered inferior to their corporate counterparts. The Vratix are humanoid insects. They have large, compound eyes, a stalk-like neck, and three pairs of limbs sprouting from a cylindrical thorax and abdomen. The upper set of limbs acts as triple- jointed arms, while the lower two serve as legs. The last set of limbs is well-muscled, and is used in jumping. Most Vratix are grey in colour, with the shades darkening with age. They have a basic form of hive mentality, but are able to function as individuals. They believe that sight and sound are not permanent things, and prefer to touch another being in order to recognize their presence. The Vratix on Thyferra govern themselves through the Ashern Circle. However, the strong pro-human sentiments found in the Zaltin and Xucphra factions have labelled the Ashern as terrorists. Although the Ashern are widely considered responsible for the contamination of certain lots of bacta, this may only be a ruse to cover up an internal struggle. Vratix was also the name given to the native language of the Vratix. It consisted of a series of clicks and high-pitched sounds, which were augmented by changes in skin colour. Because of this combination, no written form of the Vratix language was created, and non-Vratix could only learn to understand‚Äîbut not speak‚Äîthe language. Vulptereen Vulptereen are a stocky race from Vulpter, recognizable by their shovel-like snouts which sported six tusks and a single long feeler. The podracer Dud Bolt was one of the species. Vurk Vurks are a reptilian humanoid species, with elongated faces, dark eyes, and a sweeping crest extending from their skulls, giving them the appearance of a parasaurolophus. They are native to the remote planet Sembla, a watery world with warm shallow seas, small volcanic islands, and beautiful coral reefs rich in crystals. Vurks are nomadic and they are equally comfortable on both land and water. Though they are very ethical and peaceful they are wrongly considered primitive by the rest of the galaxy because they have not developed large settlements and technology. This, however, is due to not needing them and not because of low intelligence level. Jedi Master Coleman Trebor was a Vurk. Weequay They are a race of humanoid creatures that hail from the planet Sriluur, a harsh desert planet lending to the species' tanned skin tone and rough, sandy, wrinkled skin. Their eyes are dark and slightly recessed into their skull; their hair tied into at least one long braid ‚Äî a staple characteristic and religious tradition. Due to Sriluur's proximity to Hutt Space, Weequay expatriates are often found as bodyguards in Hutt syndicates, through both employment and enslavement, many are seen in Return of the Jedi, during the Sarlacc Pit scene. The most famous character from this species is the pirate Hondo Ohnaka who appears in The Clone Wars and Rebels animated series. They are a laconic people, with traditions rooted deeply in their religious beliefs. Much of their culture is structured around the worship of a pantheon of gods, primarily the God of the Moon, Quay. Their cities are built around a temple, known as a thal. Whaladon Whaladons were large sentient mammals native on Mon Calamari. They communicated via sing-songs. Poaching of Whaladons was forbidden by Mon Calamari law but they were hunted when the Galactic Empire occupied the planet. They were first featured in the novel The Glove of Darth Vader. Wharl Wharls are another name for the Tchuukthai. Whill Whills are a vague reference to the relatively omnipresent, yet totally distant Order that George Lucas planned to place the story-teller perspective on in an early draft of the Star Wars saga. Whiphid Whiphids (also known as Toolans) are tall, muscled, furred creatures with great tusks from the planet Toola. They are great hunters and they export ice to other planets. They can also go into a coma-like state to heal major wounds. One particular Whiphid was J'Quille, who, while working under Jabba the Hutt, had tried to assassinate him with a slow-acting poison in his food.Star Wars: Tales From Jabba's Palace Another Whiphid was Jedi Master K'Kruhk. He supposedly died at the Battle of Hypori, though he was shown to be alive approximately 150 years later.Star Wars: Legacy, #11 Aiaks Fwa was a Whiphid bounty hunter employed by Jabba the Hutt for services pertaining to the Battle of Ylesia. Many Whiphids can be found as thugs and enforcers in the underworld - a sizeable chunk of the thuggish workers in the aggressive, regulation- smashing Offworld Mining Corporation were Whiphids, and the crime boss Lady Valarian operating off of Tatooine, a one-time competitor with Jabba the Hutt, was also a Whiphid - as they are disliked by most other races in general for some of their crude and brutish tendencies. The home planet of the Whiphids is the icy world of Toola in the Outer Rim. Clone Commander Keller led an Imperial task force to root out Jedi hiding on Toola in the early days of the New Order. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight, found Jedi artifacts left behind by a Master of the Old Jedi Order in a cave there - possibly the work of Keller's division, although Skywalker observed lightsaber slashes in the Jedi's empty robes that he believed must have been the handiwork of his father, Darth Vader.The Courtship of Princess Leia Wirutid A Wirutid is a hyper- intelligent fungus that evolves into a human form to secure shelter and trap prey. Wol Cabasshite A commonly misunderstood and mis characterized species, Wol Cabasshites are a unique example of a culture that has advanced to sentience without the need for technology. Their evolved brains are indeed highly intelligent, but with a life cycle so abstract and alien, their musings are often indecipherable. Indeed, studying Wol Cabasshite's philosophy has long been a fashionable pastime of the intellectual elite, with longstanding debates regarding interpretation of the most famous and bizarre of Wol Cabasshite texts. The closest known genetic relative of the very long-lived Wol Cabasshites is a small, non-sentient species of plasma leech parasite whose entire life-cycle occurs on spacecraft where they feed on plasma and other energetic power sources. Millennia of space travel have spread both the non-sentient leech and the Wol Cabasshite throughout the galaxy, far from their homeworld of Wol Cabassh. Wol Cabasshites are remarkably hardy. They can exist in both vacuum and atmosphere, having no respiratory system and a naturally pressurized interior. Wol Cabasshites can tolerate remarkable temperature extremes. With a plasma-rich diet and extraordinarily high metallic content in their blood, Wol Cabasshites exude a magnetic field controlled by certain internal muscles, including their tongues. By shaping and focusing this field, Cabasshites communicate with each other at a range of up to 25 meters. Their language uses phonemic pulses of energy with syntactic contours in the field. Magnetic singing is an important part of Wol Cabasshite cultures. Gifted Wol Cabasshites can use magnetic fields to communicate directly with the neurons of other sentients, though this often requires direct contact. The sometimes unsettling sensation of direct neuron communication with a Wol Cabasshite has spread to rumors that the species can take control of a subject's brain, though that is not the case. The Wol Cabasshite ability to manipulate magnetic fields has resulted in the development of devices by other cultures to assist in communication. Wol Cabasshites can operate devices attuned to their magnetic singing for the purposes of locomotion, communication and even defense, though most do not bother. Most Wol Cabasshites are content to simply sit and contemplate the nature of the universe... and eat. Physiologically, Wol Cabasshites are mostly stomach; they even have two brains, one for digestive tasks and one for cognition. They eat constantly, extracting nutrients and metals from nearly any substance they touch. There are no known substances that are toxic to Wol Cabasshites, though they are susceptible to Brainworm Rot Type A, an airborne virus that affects their cognitive functions. Given the bizarre nature of Wol Cabasshite thought, diagnosis is very difficult. Although Wol Cabasshites reproduce asexually by vomiting out their stomach linings (which become pupal Cabasshite), adults may exchange genetic material during mutual tongue grooming. This results in organisms exhibiting isolated genetic properties of other individuals. Wookiee Wookiees are generally peaceful creatures of the forests of Kashyyyk. They have a tribal society governed by a Chieftain. They are very tall, furry and powerful with a humanoid shape. They have extremely sharp rectractable claws, however it is considered a Tribal crime to use claws in combat. Aside from their stature Wookiee have laser crossbows which can also be seen with mounted scopes. They are considered loyal friends, and commit life debts to people who save them - the most well-known being the life debt between Chewbacca and Han Solo. Woostoid Yellow-skinned humanoids from the planet Woostri. They were targeted during Grand Admiral Thrawn's campaign of galactic conquest. Surprisingly, these aliens held Imperial doctrines as truth. In the novel The Last Command, these aliens were referred to as the Woostroid. Wroonian Wroonians are a blue-skinned humanoid race from the planet Wroona in the Inner Rim. X'ting The X'ting are an insectoid species, native to the planet Cestus, that change gender every three years. This species proved to be dying out in the novel The Cestus Deception. Xendekian The Xendekian are a small species of blue, brown, green, and reddish-brown native to the planet of Xendek. They first appeared in the comic strip called Endangered, Part 1 in the lead story of Star Wars Adventures 7. Xexto The Xexto are short, (1.30m [4'3\\"] max), have four arms, two legs and long necks. They hail from the planet Troiken. Some prominent Xexto include Gasgano, the Podracer pilot; and Yarael Poof, Jedi Master and one of the last members of the Jedi Council before the Great Jedi Purge, who was a member of a genetically altered sect of Xexto, the Quermians. Y'bith Millions of years ago, sentience took root among the ancient forerunners of the Bith species on Clak'dor VII. As the Bith evolved, they developed impressive cities in the mountains and jungles of their world. The capital city of Weogar and the domed city of Nozho stood for centuries as testament to the achievement of the proto-Bith culture, but relations between the cities soured, and they developed a fierce rivalry. About three hundred years ago, the tensions boiled over as a dispute over a stardrive patent ignited in a civil war. When the war finally ended, Clak'dor VII's biosphere was ruined. A biological attack launched at Nozho had shattered the city, mutating its populace, and the surrounding wildlife. Most Nozho citizens were killed outright, but many who survived developed mutagenic irregularities that soon led to the creation of a subspecies of Bith. The Y'bith‚Äîwhich translates as \\"Ghost Bith,\\" eventually left the hermetically sealed cities that were built amid the ruins, and attempted to establish a permanent population on Clak'dor IV, where they eventually founded the city of New Nozho. The bio- engineering geniuses among the Y'bith stabilized much of the mutation's worst effects, but the populace had to adapt to their new traits of poor eyesight, stronger hands and feet, ductile mouth structures, sensitive skin and thicker bones. The Y'bith have been tolerated by the Bith, though not openly accepted by mainstream Bith culture. Though some claim residual guilt over the bombings that created the Y'bith as the cause of Bith apprehension, the Bith themselves pragmatically deny such reasons. They cite the Y'bith's volatile biochemistry that triggers bouts of violence and aggression as reason enough to keep their distance. The Y'bith have been working to gain acceptance as members of the galactic community, with New Nozho becoming a notable trade port. Over the course of generations, the Y'bith had spread to other worlds, forming a notable minority presence on Nar Shaddaa and Coruscant, where they aided the rebuilding efforts following the Yuuzhan Vong war. The Y'bith see the story of their people as one of success, and will continue working tirelessly until the whole galaxy, including their Bith cousins, agree. Yaka The Yaka are a race of near-human cyborgs. They were transformed after their home planet was invaded centuries ago by superintelligent inhabitants of Arkania, a neighboring star system. The Arkanians forced the Yakas to undergo surgery in which they implanted cyborg brain enhancers, increasing the species' intelligence to genius level. Thus, the brutish-looking Yakas are much smarter than they appear. A side effect of the implants is a twisted sense of humor that all Yakas possess. Yevetha Yevetha are a now extinct or severely endangered skeletal-looking race of humanoids from the planet N'zoth, near the Galactic Core. They were extremely xenophobic, considering all other races to be vermin. The Empire utilized them as shipyard workers and technicians during the Galactic Civil War, primarily because of their perfectionist nature and knack for technology. This backfired when the Yevetha took over all the Black 15 shipyards and killed or enslaved all the Imperials during a full retreat. During the events of the New Jedi Order, the Yuuzhan Vong attacked and destroyed the Yevetha at the behest of the Fia, a race from the Koornacht Cluster world of Galantos. So great was the Yevethan disdain for other species that one of the survivors chose to attack and destroy a Chiss clawcraft rather than accept aid. An Imperial officer once commented to Princess Leia that the Empire had always feared the potential of the Yevetha, noting that they were never allowed access to sensitive technology like hyperdrives. At their peak, the Yevetha controlled a vast fleet of Imperial Star Destroyers, Interdictor Cruisers, their own custom-made thrustships, and the Super Star Destroyer Pride of Yevetha. Yinchorri Yinchorri were a race of turtle-like sentients from the planet Yinchorr. Yoda's species An unnamed race of diminutive green-skinned creatures with large pointed ears, they are powerful with The Force. Known members include Yoda, Yaddle, Vandar Tokare and The Child (a.k.a. \\"Baby Yoda\\" of The Mandalorian). They can live for several centuries. Much about the species, including their name and origins, has been deliberately left vague by George Lucas and other Star Wars writers. Yuuzhan Vong / Grysk The Yuuzhan Vong were introduced as the main antagonists of the book series The New Jedi Order (1999‚Äì2003) depicted as an extragalactic, technophobic, fanatically religious species who were intent upon conquering the galaxy, which they attempted during the Yuuzhan Vong War (25‚Äì29 ABY). They were both invisible to direct Force sight and unaffected by direct Force powers. The Yuuzhan Vong used biotechnology instead of mechanical technology. Their homeworld was at first in a different galaxy and was called Yuuzhan'tar, which was destroyed in the Cremlevian War. Some went to a seed that was produced from the ashes of Yuuzhan'Tar which was first seen by people in the Unknown Regions and was called Zonama Sekot. Others went to Coruscant, which they renamed Yuuzhan'tar upon conquering the planet in 27 ABY, ending the New Republic. The Yuuzhan Vong believed that all other races were little more than barbarians who were not fit to live in their presence. Because of this the Vong attempted to conquer the universe with little thought to the damage they were doing to the universe or its inhabitants. The only race the Vong saw as a threat, or as close to a threat as they were willing to believe, were Wookiees. They saw them as fierce warriors and felt that they deserved to live. For this reason, the Vong enslaved Wookiees rather than attempting to destroy them. After the fall of Coruscant, the scattered New Republic's troops reorganised and joined forces with the Imperial Remnant (established in 12 ABY) to form the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances (or simply Galactic Alliance) in 28 ABY, which managed to defeat the Yuuzhan Vong and drive them back to the Unknown Regions in 29 ABY. The species was said to have featured peripherally in cancelled episodes of The Clone Wars. ;Canon After the October 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by Disney, the Yuuzhan Vong were declared non- canonical in April 2014. In their stead, the film Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) introduced the First Order, a faction that arose from one of many Imperial Remnants between 5 and 21 ABY, and eventually destroyed the New Republic in 34 ABY, while the Resistance (formed in 28 ABY) continued to fight against the First Order. A canonical version of the Yuuzhan Vong, now known as the Grysk, were introduced in the Timothy Zahn novel Thrawn: Alliances (2018). Both species are described as having sloping foreheads and skull-like faces, and being a threat to the Chiss Ascendancy hailing from the Unknown Regions and enslaving other races, though the Grysk use conventional mechanical technology rather than biotechnology, as the novel is set in an earlier time frame than the previous non-canonical Legends novels. Yuvernian The Yuvernians are a two-headed, mottled-skinned reptilian horselike race from the planet of Yuvern. They were fairly large beings, 4.8 meters in length, and standing 2.4 meters in height. They had yellow skin with black spots and elongated skulls. A Yuvernian named Cane Adiss can be seen in Jabba's palace in Episode VI. Yuzzem The Yuzzem are a large powerful mammalian species similar to Wookiees. Most were enslaved during the reign of the Empire and taken from their home planet of Ragna III to do hard labor. They appear similar to Wookiees, but appearing more like werewolves. Their similarities to Wookiees have led people to believe the two share a common ancestor, but this has not been confirmed. Yuzzum The Yuzzums (not to be confused with Yuzzem) are fur-covered mammals with a wide mouth with protruding teeth on top of their heads and long legs. They are less intelligent than the Ewoks and dwell on the plains of the forest moon Endor. Groups of Yuzzums often hunt in packs through the tall grass of the plains hunting for rodents to eat. They have been exported as pets, but are not very good at it. They have a musical language and some Yuzzums have found employment as singers. One of the singers in Jabba the Hutt's court was a Yuzzum named Joh Yowza. Only three Yuzzums have been seen so far: Joh Yowza, Schmood, and Wam Lufba. Joh Yowza is the only CGI Yuzzum, the rest are puppets. Zabrak The Zabrak are humanoids whose most distinctive feature is the array of small horns on top of their heads. Their home planet is Iridonia, though they have established many colonies on planets throughout the galaxy. It is believed that they are among the galaxy's first space-faring people. They have strong willpower and are a stubborn, proud people. By nature, they tend to be independent and fearless, hence have never been a successful venture in the slave trade. One commonly recognized individual of this race is Darth Maul, Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious. Their crown of horns typically grow in at puberty, and are considered secondary sex characteristics. The pattern in which these horns grow differs between Zabrak sub-species. Zabrak skin coloration can range from the rare pure white or pure black, to the more common shades of cream, red, peach, tan, and brown in between. Iridonian skin color is a matter of genetic dominance and recessiveness, such as with the Ewok species, whose fur comes in various colors and patterns. Zabrak can be completely bald or fully haired. Again, it is analogous to race/subspecies. Certain horn patterns are linked with certain hair patterns or lack thereof. Hair can be any of the same colors seen in the human species. However, unlike humans, Zabrak males do not have eyebrows and do not grow facial hair. There is also a different pattern of horns for each gender. The horns on the female are more directed to the front of the head, while the most commonly males have them spanned all across the top of their head. Zabrak eye colors are often similar to the eye colors of humans, with blues and browns being the most common. Yellow, purple, red, green, and orange eyes are seen regularly. However, Darth Maul's red-yellow eye color was apparently the result of corruption by the Dark Side. Zabrak also traditionally have facial tattoos, typically composed of a pattern of thin lines, which is considered the most traditional of Zabrak tattoos. In certain cases these tattoos can be quite elaborate (Maul's extensive black tattoo was actually a Nightbrother tattoo, not a traditional Zabrak tattoo), but most Zabrak tend to be conservative with their designs. It is unclear what these designs signify. They may indicate which family the Zabrak belongs to, where they grew up, or they may well be just a matter of personal preference on the part of the Zabrak. Zabrak are also well known for their skill with technology and highly advanced weaponry. Known Zabrak from canon include Agen Kolar, Eeth Koth, Gaar from the Boba Fett book, Darth Maul and Savage Opress. Known Zabrak from the Star Wars expanded universe include Bao-Dur (Knights of the Old Republic II), Maris Brood (Force Unleashed), and Wolf Sazen (Star Wars: Legacy). Zabrak are popular in the gaming world. The customizable player character of Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, Jaden Korr, can be a Zabrak female. Players of the MMO Star Wars: Galaxies were able to choose Zabrak as a playable race, and can currently do so in the Star Wars MMO, Star Wars: The Old Republic. Zeltron The extremely attractive Zeltrons are a near-human species native to the planet Zeltros. Their skin is bright pink, full red to dark brown, a special pigmentation that develops from a reaction to their sun's radiation. The Zeltron people have the ability to project powerful pheromones, much like those emitted by Falleen. These can be activated at will and can affect a specific individual or entire groups at the same time. Zeltrons are also empathic, able to sense the feelings of others as well as project their own. For this reason their love and comfort is extremely important to them. Sharing positive emotions is deemed to everyone's benefit, while sharing negative emotions is not. In accordance with this, Zeltros‚Äô democratic government will go to great lengths to make sure no one on Zeltros is unhappy. Zeltros has had few tyrants or despotic rulers, because they cannot commit atrocities without experiencing another's pain. Zeltros has, however, been invaded twelve times in the past six centuries. But most invaders, because of the Zeltrons‚Äô pheromones, have given up their hostile intentions and joined in the non-stop festivities. Hence, Zeltrons do not worry about such trivial matters as planetary defenses or military forces. They are able fighters, though, and they stay in peak physical condition at all times. Zeltrons will go to any length to please guests, and they get pleasure from being hospitable. They hold massive celebrations for practically any event. They are also extremely promiscuous, and are extremely proud of their sexual prowess. They consider the concept of monogamy quaint, but unrealistic. Zeltron technology is on par with most space-faring worlds. They possess space travel, advanced agricultural and industrial methods, and excellent knowledge of medicine, particularly antibiotics. Zeltron scientists have provided notable refinements in the fields of science, and created much of the technology for the Pleasure Domes at Hologram Fun World. Zeltron craftsmen are renowned the galaxy over for their erotic sculptures, paintings, and other works of art. Also in high demand on other worlds are Zeltron courtesans, known as criblez, who fulfill any physical desire one may have, without limits. Many crime lords, particularly Hutts, have taken special interest in these Zeltron servants. Because of their popularity, and because they spend their lives pursuing gratification, Zeltrons are quite common in the galaxy, particularly at spaceports, where they can find many prospective mates. Essential Guide to Alien Species, Del Rey, 2001 This race has now appeared in the Star Wars videogame Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords. One Zeltron seen in the Star Wars series was Luxa, an employee for the Exchange on Telos. Zhell The Zhell are the supposed pre-evolved state of humans in the Star Wars galaxy. The Zhell were dominant on Coruscant at some point before 25,000 BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin) until the Taung conquered them. In the middle of their epic battle against the Zhell, their efforts were helped by an erupting volcano that wiped out the major Zhell city. The Taung then systematically destroyed all remaining Zhell camps. Zillo Beast The Zillo Beast was a gargantuan serpentlike creature with a lengthy whip-like tail. At 97 meters tall, the Zillo Beast towered over all species on its native planet of Malastare and was considered at the top of its food chain until its presumed extinction. Its tail contained eight sharp spikes, and the beast itself uniquely possessed a third arm protruding from its back. Its heavy plated armor was invulnerable to explosions, blaster fire, and even lightsaber strikes. Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker discovered that gaps in the creature's armored plates could be exploited to damage or stun the creature. On one such occasion, clone troopers were able to subdue the creature by using stun tanks aimed at the gaps in its armor to put the beast to sleep for transport to Coruscant. This creature first appeared in The Clone Wars season 2, episode 18, \\"The Zillo Beast\\". Zygerrian The Zygerrians are a race of feline-like bipeds, who are slavers from the planet Zygerria which is governed by queen Miraj Scintel. They appear on The Clone Wars during the Slaves of the Republic arc.

The park was called Fantasy Gardens because it was surrounded by a series of stone buildings that were designed to resemble structures built during the Middle Ages. The buildings had been used as a backdrop in numerous music videos, television productions, and movies (it stood in for Halloweentown in Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge). Behind the stone buildings were the Biblical Gardens. These gardens were filled with numerous religious icons, including a hedge that had been carved into the shape of a Bible.  History   As garden centre  Fantasy Gardens was home to a massive plant store in the Art Knapp's chain, owned by Frank Van Hest (1932-2005) in 1965. Bill Vander Zalm's son Wim owned several other stores in the Art Knapp's chain. Many people visited the store to get a glimpse of its turtle-filled pond. This plant store closed its location at Fantasy Gardens, moving to a vacant nursery one mile west along Alderbridge Way and Minoru Boulevard. The Art Knapp's Nursery stores were founded by Arthur William Knapp, a longtime resident of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.  As amusement park  During the 1970s and early 1990s, there was a small-scale amusement park at Fantasy Gardens. The biggest attraction was a miniature railroad that visitors could ride throughout the park and the gardens. When the fair closed down, most of the miniature railroad tracks were ripped up. Before being closed, this miniature railroad was filmed and it appeared in The X-Files episode \\"The Calusari.\\" In 1984, the gardens were bought by Bill Vander Zalm, who established the Christian theme of much of the park. Then a provincial MLA, Vander Zalm went on to be Premier of British Columbia. His later sale of the park led to charges of conflict of interest, which in turn led to his resignation in 1991 and the defeat of the Social Credit government.  Decline, closure and residential re-development  Vander Zalm sold the property in the early 1990s to Chinese-born Filipino- Taiwanese businessman Tan Yu for $16 million, whose AsiaWorld then sold it to local developer firm Townline in 2007 that redeveloped into retail property named The Gardens. On 7 September 2010, Fantasy Gardens was torn down, but the Dutch Castle, now a community landmark, was saved. The castle is a replica of Coevorden Castle, possibly the ancestral home of Captain George Vancouver in the Netherlands. The castle was donated to the people of Vancouver by the city of Coevorden for Expo 86. The castle was used as sales centre for the Gardens, a planned residential development. The southern portion is now a condo complex with a Loblaws supermarket, but the former amusement park will become a 12 acres public park for the further residential buildings. The former Dutch/Coevorden Castle will become a City of Richmond-owned day care centre.  Filming on site  The site was also used as the primary set of the \\"Revisions\\" episode of the TV series Stargate SG-1, the \\"Irresponsible\\" episode of Stargate Atlantis, the \\"Monster Movie\\" episode of Supernatural and in the episodes \\"Shadows\\" and \\"Blackmail\\" episodes from Highlander: The Series.

The Marquis de Puys√©gur learned about Mesmerism from his brother Antoine- Hyacinthe, the Count of Chastenet. One of his first and most important patients was Victor Race, a 23-year-old peasant in the employ of the Puys√©gur family. Race was easily \\"magnetized\\" by Puys√©gur, but displayed a strange form of sleeping trance not before seen in the early history of Mesmerism. Puys√©gur noted the similarity between this sleeping trance and natural sleep-walking or somnambulism, and he named it \\"artificial somnambulism\\". Today we know similar states by the name \\"hypnosis\\", although that term was invented much later by James Braid in 1842. Some characteristics of Puysegur's artificial somnambulism were in any case specific of his method. Puys√©gur rapidly became a highly successful magnetist, to whom people came from all over France. In 1785, Puys√©gur taught a course in animal magnetism to the local Masonic society, which he concluded with these words: Puys√©gur's institute for training in animal magnetism, Soci√©t√© Harmonique des Amis R√©unis, grew rapidly until the Revolution in 1789. During the revolutionary era the institute was disbanded and Puys√©gur spent two years in prison. After the Napoleons' overthrow, the new generation of practitioners of mesmerists (and later of hypnotists) looked to Puys√©gur as their patriarch, and came to accept his method of inducing a sleeping trance in preference to the original methods of Mesmer. Puys√©gur, however, always portrayed himself as a faithful disciple of Mesmer, and never took credit for having invented the procedure that is now known as hypnotic induction. His contributions were gradually forgotten, until Nobel prize-winner Charles Richet rediscovered his writings in 1884, and showed that most of what other people had claimed as their discoveries in the field of magnetism and hypnotherapy were originally due to the Marquis de Puys√©gur. Henri Ellenberger, the great historian of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy, wrote that Puys√©gur was \\"one of the great forgotten contributors to the history of the psychological sciences.\\" The details of the life and work of Puys√©gur may be found in Ellenberger's book, The Discovery of the Unconscious, pp. 70‚Äì74. Ellenberger's view of Puys√©gur was supported and amplified in Peter Sloterdijk's book Critique of Cynical Reason. In this work, Sloterdijk emphasized Puys√©gur's contributions in his refutation of the common idea that intellectuals of the Enlightenment were not interested in the subconscious mind.

This Is What You Get (1984) ‚Äì for this reason, Commercial Zone is often considered to be an earlier/alternative version of that album.  Background  In May 1981 PiL moved from London to New York City, but in October 1981 their American record contract with Warner Brothers expired and was not renewed. In January 1982 the British music press reported that PiL had tried to record a new album in New York with producers Adam Kidron and Ken Lockie, but split instead ‚Äì this was promptly denied by the band in a press release the following week. In May 1982 drummer Martin Atkins rejoined the band and PiL started recording their new studio album for Virgin Records at Park South Studios in Manhattan, with sound engineer Bob Miller co-producing. On 29 August 1982 new bassist Pete Jones joined the band in the studio, the new line-up played its debut concert four weeks later (28 September 1982 in New York City). During the second half of 1982 the band planned to form their own record label (Public Enterprise Productions) and license its releases to Stiff Records USA for the American market, but these plans never materialised. In early November 1982 PiL announced the imminent release of a new single \\"Blue Water\\" and a six-track mini album You Are Now Entering a Commercial Zone on their new label. This did not happen, with the band instead continuing to record a full-length album at Park South Studios. By March 1983 a new track \\"This Is Not a Love Song\\" was earmarked as a new single by the band, but PiL broke up when first Pete Jones and then Keith Levene left the band. The single \\"This Is Not a Love Song\\" (with \\"Blue Water\\" as a 12\\" single B-side, both from the Park South sessions) was released in Japan by Nippon Columbia in June 1983. Virgin Records released it in the UK in September 1983, where it went to no.5 in the UK single charts. The remaining members, John Lydon and drummer Martin Atkins hired session musicians to fulfill touring commitments and carried on under the PiL name. In mid-1983, in PiL's absence, Keith Levene took the unfinished album tapes and did his own mix. He then flew over to London and presented them to Richard Branson as the finished new PiL album for Virgin Records, but John Lydon decided to completely abandon the tapes and re-record the whole album from scratch with session musicians. This new version of Commercial Zone became This Is What You Want... This Is What You Get in 1984. Release Levene decided to release the album himself on the American market and on 30 January 1984 registered the label PIL Records Inc. for this one-off release. PIL Records, Inc. (registered on 30 January 1984 as a domestic business corporation by Keith Levene [1 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10003], dissolved due to inactivity on 26 September 1990) The first limited pressing of 10,000 copies for which Levene paid $8,500 out of his own pocketJohn Gentile: Interviews: Keith Levene (P.I.L., The Clash). In: Punknews.org, 9 May 2014. was self-distributed to record shops around New York City and heavily imported to the UK and European market. A second pressing (with the track listing changed around and a shorter mix of \\"Bad Night\\") followed in August 1984 in an edition of 30,000 copies, to compete directly with the official re-recorded album This Is What You Want... This Is What You Get. Virgin Records promptly took legal actions and stopped the distribution and any further re-pressings of Commercial Zone. In 2014 Levene announced plans to revisit Commercial Zone and finally finish it.

At the time people were saying that I'd joined big business and become a bourgeois shit. So I thought the best way of tackling this would be to pump out a song saying 'That's exactly what I am!' Tongue firmly in cheek. And that kind of stopped that nonsense ‚Äì so it worked.‚ÄùNeil Spencer: ‚ÄúPublic Image Limited‚Äù (Volume Three, May 1992) ‚Äú'This Is Not A Love Song' was a sort of response to that constant request from the record company for those HITS.

Virologists Oliveira and Weiss attempt to find a cure amid large-scale societal changes happening around them. *\\"Language for Time Travelers\\" (essay). De Camp explores an issue hitherto ignored by writers of time-travel fiction; the barriers to communication in the eras visited by time-travelers posed by natural language change. Examples of the difficulties involved are humorously explored through the fictional tribulations of one such traveler confronted with various linguistic scenarios. *\\"The Command\\". Uplifted bear Johnny Black discovers the scientists who have granted him human intelligence have been reduced by a mysterious disease to automatons, unable to function except in response to direct orders. Johnny is equal to taking out the would-be world conqueror responsible, but curing the victims proves problematic‚Äîhe has the counter-agent, but his bear paws can't inject it, and with his bear vocal chords can't order them to do so themselves. If he can't figure out a solution, the plague will spread world-wide, and humanity is doomed. *\\"The Merman\\". Vernon Brock is a biologist who experiments with turning lungs into gills. After accidentally performing the transformation on himself, he is stuck underwater, unable to communicate, and attempts to resolve the situation using his limited knowledge. *\\"Employment\\". Paleontologist and inventor Gilmore Platt has devised a method of restoring fossil animals to life, causing difficulties for his assistant-turned zookeeper Kenneth Staples‚Äîparticularly after Mr. Nively, representing the country's animal importers, shoots their mammoth to shut down the competition from these prehistoric resurrectionists. It only makes the mammoth mad... If Staples can't handle the situation he may be out of a job. *\\"The Gnarly Man\\". Shining Hawk, a Neanderthal man rendered ageless by a lightning strike, has survived into modern times by keeping a low profile. Currently posting as one Clarence Gaffney, he is found out by scientist Matilda Sandler, at whose urging he warily agrees to submit to medical examination in return for surgery to correct some old injuries. But when Sandler develops a romantic interest in him and the prospective surgeon is discovered plotting to dissect him to achieve medical fame, Gaffney bolts. *\\"Reward of Virtue\\" (poem). *\\"Nothing in the Rules\\". Accusations of foul play ensue when a mermaid is entered at a swim meet, but the stratagem appears perfectly legal. No such ploy ever having been envisioned, it turns out that nothing in the rules states a contestant can't have a tail, or even has to be human... *\\"The Hardwood Pile\\". When Dan Pringle's Gahato sawmill processes a tree harboring a dryad, the spirit, having no other home, remains with the resulting pile of lumber, \\"haunting\\" it to prevent its dispersal. A running conflict between the two ensues, ending only when Pringle agrees to sell the whole pile to renovate the dance floor of a local bar, at which his antagonist then becomes an employee. *\\"The Reluctant Shaman\\". Indian curio-shop proprietor Virgil Hathaway gets stuck babysitting a batch of mischievous Iroquois spirits, who get out of control and run rampant \\"helping\\" people with poltergeist-style tricks. Only a medicine man can bring them to heel, but is Hathaway up to the task? *\\"The Inspector's Teeth\\". Hithafea, a dinosaur-like native from the planet Osiris enrolls in an Earth college and pledges one of its fraternities. Snobbish big man on campus John Fitzgerald, resenting Hithafea, hazes him mercilessly. But how does this connect with the fate of an interstellar treaty negotiated many years later? *\\"The Guided Man\\". The Telagog Company can take over your body for you in awkward social situations, enabling you to negotiate them effortlessly. The service is a godsend for bashful Ovid Ross, until his controller decides he wants the same girl Ovid does... *\\"The Ameba\\" (poem). *\\"Judgment Day\\". Physicist Wade Ormont discovers an unsuspected type of nuclear reaction that could make his reputation‚Äîand, in the wrong hands, lead inevitably to universal destruction. Should he publish his findings and bask in the ephemeral glory, or does the survival of a world that has rejected and despised him count more? *\\"A Gun for Dinosaur\\". Time-traveling hunter Reginald Rivers recounts an anecdote from one of his time safari expeditions involving problematic clients. Courtney James is an arrogant and spoiled playboy; August Holtzinger is a small, timid man, too puny the handle the heavy weaponry needed to take down Cretaceous period dinosaurs. Reluctantly, Rivers allows him on the safari with a lighter caliber weapon. James' reckless shooting rouses a slumbering Tyrannosaurus. Holtzinger tries to save him, but the creature shrugs off his gunfire and snaps him up. Rivers aborts the trip, angering James, who later tries to go back to the Cretaceous again and assassinate Rivers' past self. But the space-time continuum has a rough way with time paradoxes... *\\"The Emperor's Fan\\". Emperor Tsotuga of Kuromon feels insecure on his throne, and seeks security in magic. An enchanted fan enabling him to wave away all his troubles seems just the thing. Unfortunately, he loses the code-book that enables him to restore those accidentally fanned, including most of his advisers‚Äîand the device proves little obstacle to a clever and unscrupulous conspirator... *\\"Two Yards of Dragon\\". Squire Eudoric Damberson wishes to wed his magical tutor's daughter and become a knight. The price is procuring for the magician a portion of dragon hide for use in his magic.

He considered it \\"long overdue,\\" citing \\"Language for Time Travelers\\" as \\"seminal\\" in \\"creat[ing] a permanent change in the way many time travel stories are written, or should be written\\" and \\"The Gnarly Man,\\" \\"Nothing in the Rules\\" and \\"A Gun for Dinosaur\\" as \\"classics from which many subsequent stories by other writers have derived. ... \\"Time after time, de Camp has created basic ideas which were obviously larger than his original setting, and whose development within the minds of other writers has given them a species of extended life, to the enrichment of the genre.\\" \\"The Emperor's Fan,\\" \\"The Hardwood Pile\\" and \\"Judgment Day\\" are also singled out for positive comment. De Camp's fiction, Budrys notes, provides \\"entertainment on a high level of intelligence,\\" and the author himself \\"is another one of those people who does good work and endures.\\"Budrys, Algis. \\"Books,\\" in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, v. 55, no. 3, September 1978, pages 37-38.

Biography Born in 1902, Franz Oppenhoff received a law degree from Cologne University, and worked as a lawyer until World War II. Oppenhoff was an expert on Nazi law, had been legal representative for the Bishop of Aachen, Johannes Joseph van der Velden, and had defended some cases for Jewish companies. Knowing that the Gestapo was interested in him, he had taken refuge in Eupen, across the border in Belgium, in September 1944, taking his wife and three daughters with him. Following the occupation of Aachen after the Battle of Aachen, in October 1944, Allied officials wanted to appoint a non-Nazi to take over administration of the city. Assisted by the Bishop of Aachen, officials managed to make contact with a group of local business people, one of whom was willing to become the first German mayor under American rule. This was Franz Oppenhoff, who was then 42 years old. When Oppenhoff was sworn into office on 31 October 1944 no press photos were permitted and his name was not divulged, the reason being that he still had relatives in Nazi Germany who might be liable to reprisals from the Nazi regime. Also, earlier in October the SS newspaper, Das Schwarze Korps, had written that there would be no German administration under the occupation because any official who collaborated with the enemy could count on being dead within a month.Press and Information Office, The Federal Republic of Germany, The Bulletin, May 12, 1970 In December 1944 a group of officers belonging to the US Army's Psychological Warfare Division, coordinated by historian Saul K. Padover, arrived in Aachen to assess the German population's political views and their attitude to the Nazis and the local situation. In January 1945 Padover claimed that he had discovered a \\"wholesale political conspiracy\\" in the city, centering on Oppenhoff, whose purpose was to keep left-wing forces out of stewardship. Padover reported to his superiors that the Aachen city administration \\"...is shrewd, strongwilled, and aggressive... Its leader is Oberb√ºrgermeister Oppenhoff...behind Oppenhoff is the bishop of Aachen, a powerful figure with a subtlety of his own... All of these men managed to stay out of the Nazi party, most of them were directly connected with the town's leading war industries, [Veltrup and Talbot ]...These men are not democratically minded... They are planning the future in terms of an authoritarian highly bureaucratic state...Politically it is conceived as small-state Clericalism...\\". To make matters \\"worse\\", Oppenhoff and his associates had displayed what was seen as leniency in accepting ex-Nazis for jobs in the city administration. Padover saw to it that his story was leaked to the press so as to create sufficient uproar in the American public, and a purge of the city administration resulted, to expel former Nazis. Operation Carnival Oppenhoff's grave in Aachen Oppenhoff was considered a traitor and a collaborationist by the Nazi regime, and his assassination, codenamed Unternehmen Karneval (\\"Operation Carnival\\"), was ordered by Heinrich Himmler, planned by SS Obergruppenf√ºhrer Hans-Adolf Pr√ºtzmann, and carried out by an assassination unit composed of four SS men and two members of the Hitler Youth. The unit was commanded by SS Untersturmf√ºhrer Herbert Wenzel, who was a training officer at Pr√ºtzmann's Werwolf training facility at H√ºlchrath Castle, near Erkelenz; Wenzel arranged the necessary equipment and decided on methods. Unterscharf√ºhrer (Sergeant) Josef Leitgeb, also a training officer at H√ºlchrath, was second-in-command. Ilse Hirsch, a 23-year-old Nazi youth leader, a Hauptgruppenf√ºhrerin (Captain) in the BDM (League of German Girls) was supposed to provide supplies but turned out to play an important part in the operation. Wenzel also picked a Werwolf trainee from H√ºlchrath to accompany them, 16-year-old Erich Morgenschweiss.Hitler's Children, p. 244 Two former members of the Border Patrol (Karl-Heinz Hennemann and Georg Heidorn) completed the team, to act as guides in the area around Aachen. The unit parachuted from a captured B-17 bomber into a Belgian forest on 20 March 1945. They killed a Dutch border guardJos Saive. https://www.tracesofwar.com/sights/50473/Monument-Jos-Saive.htm at the frontier, then moved on to set up camp near the target. Hirsch became separated from the rest and made her own way to Aachen, where she contacted a friend in the BDM and discovered Oppenhoff's whereabouts. The rest of the unit arrived in Aachen on March 25. Wenzel, Leitgeb and one other confronted Oppenhoff on his own doorstep after he had been fetched from a party at his neighbours' house. They pretended to be German pilots who were looking for the German lines. Oppenhoff tried to persuade them to surrender. Wenzel hesitated, and Leitgeb shouted \\"Heil Hitler\\" and shot Oppenhoff in the head. Just before a US patrol arrived to check the telephone line which Wenzel had previously cut, the three assassins scattered. While making their escape from the city, Hirsch triggered a landmine, which injured her and killed Leitgeb. Following the war, the surviving members of the assassination squad, with the exception of Wenzel, were tracked down and arrested. At their trial in Aachen in October 1949, all were found guilty and sentenced to between one and four years in prison, and Hirsch and one other member were set free.

The summit is roughly 19 km south of Harihari and reaches in height.Pat Barrett, 17 August 1999, \\"Top From the Top\\", Christchurch Press, pg. 36. Mount Adams lies to the west of the main divide of the Southern Alps and drains into the Whataroa and Poerua catchments. Both of these rivers flow westwards to the Tasman Sea. There are two small glaciers on the south-eastern slopes that drain the summit ice cap; the Escape Glacier (about 2.1 km in length) and the Siege Glacier (about 3.6 km).  Climate  This area, like much of the West Coast region, is subject to high precipitation by world standards. There are no rainfall gauges on Mount Adams, but a gauge in Whataroa valley at the bridge 10 km south-west of the summit at 60 metres above sea level, records a mean annual rainfall of 5690 mm (224 inches) and daily falls of up to 320 mm (12 inches). West Coast Regional Council, retrieved 1 January 2010 It is likely that the precipitation at higher elevations on Mount Adams will be significantly greater than this, and a rain gauge in the Cropp River 42 km north-east of Mount Adams at 860 metres above sea level, records a mean annual rainfall of 10,690 mm (421 inches) and daily falls of up to 695 mm (27 inches).West Coast Regional Council, retrieved 1 January 2010  Geology  The Alpine Fault runs across the lower North- western slopes of the mountain near the edge of the coastal outwash plain, Department of Geology, University of Otago, retrieved 2 January 2010 and is the boundary between the Pacific and Indo-Australian tectonic plates.Department of Geology, University of Otago, retrieved 2 January 2010 Mount Adams itself is composed primarily of schist of Permian‚ÄìTriassic (depositional) age, which is increasingly metamorphosed closer to the Alpine Fault.Graham T.

On 6 October 1999, a large rock landslide originating near the northern summit of Mount Adams deposited c.10‚Äì15 million cubic metres of rock in the Poerua River below. This created a 120-metre (390 ft) high landslide dam, which formed a lake that extended 1.2 kilometres upstream. The dam failed six days later during heavy rain. Fears of major damage did not turn into reality when the dam was breached, though significant quantities of coarse gravel were deposited downstream and the river's path was changed in places. Summit of Mt Adams (at right) from point 2194 m. Siege Glacier at centre and left. Late summer conditions.  Access  Mount Adams is unique in that it is one of the only glaciated peaks situated on or to the west of the main divide that is accessible as a weekend trip from a west coast road end.FederatedMountain Clubs of New Zealand, FMC Bulletin July 2008, Number 176, The standard route to the summit starts from a hidden layby off SH6 and heads up Dry Creek/Little Man River to a steep spur where a marked route starts. The marked route ends at the bushline and the remainder of the climb is on tussock, rock, and eventually the summit ice cap glacier. Although this route is technically not difficult, it involves multiple river crossings, off track travel up Dry Creek/Little Man River and above the bushline, and glacial travel requiring an ice axe and crampons.Pat Barrett, 17 August 1999, \\"Top From the Top\\", Christchurch Press, pg. 36.

Dietary indiscretion is the tendency for certain animals to feed on unusual items, or undergo drastic changes in feeding behaviour. The unusual items can include non-foodstuffs, such as garbage or foreign objects, or foodstuffs that are not normally consumed by the animal. The changes in feeding behaviour can include the ingestion of spoiled or raw food, or consuming abnormally large quantities of food. Dietary indiscretion is relatively uncommon in humans, but is especially prevalent in domesticated animals, such as dogs, as a result of their close contact with their human owners.  In humans  Dietary indiscretion is relatively uncommon in humans, except for people with certain psychological disorders.  Eating disorders  In individuals with diabetes, dietary indiscretion refers to eating foods that are not doctor-recommended. Certain eating disorders, such as binge-eating disorder and bulimia nervosa, involve compulsions to engage in episodes of binge eating. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, a binge involves an episode of dietary indiscretion, where an abnormally large amount of food is consumed in a short period, and the individual feels that they do not have control over the amount they are eating. Dietary indiscretion is also characteristic of another eating disorder known as pica, which is characterized by an appetite for non-nutritive substances, such as paper, cloth, and soil.  Diabetes  The phrase \\"dietary indiscretion\\" is sometimes used by endocrinologists when discussing patients with diabetes mellitus. In particular, individuals with type 2 diabetes should avoid certain dietary items, including sugar-sweetened beverages, saturated and trans fats, and starches, such as white rice. When doctors are treating patients with diabetes, dietary indiscretion refers to the patient not following the dietary recommendations, and consuming foods that can potentially exacerbate the effects of their diabetes. For example, in a case study by J.S. Baird of Columbia University, when a patient presents to the hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis, the first step for physicians is to determine whether or not the patient had performed dietary indiscretion, which could be a potential cause of the ketoacidosis.  Other animals  Dietary indiscretion frequently occurs in domesticated animals, especially in dogs. Dietary indiscretion involving the consumption of human food by domesticated dogs can be harmful and can result in conditions including acute inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) and acute gastritis. In addition to these conditions, dietary indiscretion can be harmful to animals if non-digestible items, such as bones, are consumed. These items cannot be digested, and as such they often become lodged in the intestinal tract, causing severe, often life-threatening, digestive distress. If the animal consumes a substance that is contaminated with bacteria or other toxic substances, garbage toxicosis, or \\"garbage gut\\", can result. Garbage toxicosis involves the bacteria (or other toxic substances) entering the digestive system, resulting in the production of toxins by the bloodstream. In dogs, garbage toxicosis results in symptoms similar to those in humans with gastroenteritis. These can include: * bloody or watery diarrhea * projectile vomiting * abdominal pain and swelling * fever * lack of energy * dehydration Garbage toxicosis can generally be diagnosed by veterinarians based on symptoms and physical examination. Occasionally, further tests, such as blood and stool samples, X-rays, and other diagnostic assays are used to confirm the diagnosis.

When used in traffic and traffic engineering circles, this generally refers to the regulation of interchanges, intersections, driveways and median openings to a roadway. Its objectives are to enable access to land uses while maintaining roadway safety and mobility through controlling access location, design, spacing and operation. This is particularly important for major roadways intended to provide efficient service to through-traffic movements. Access management is most evident on freeways (UK term motorways) where access is grade separated and all movements are via dedicated ramps. It is very important on arterial roads where at-grade intersections and private driveways greatly increase the number of conflicts involving vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. It is also important on minor roadways for safety considerations such as driver sight distance. Planners, engineers, architects, developers, elected officials, citizens and attorneys all play a significant role in access management. Businesses frequently view any attempt to limit access to their land uses as economically detrimental. This can make implementation controversial. However, there is evidence showing that access management can have the positive effect of increasing market area through reducing travel times on major roadways, and that minor increases in circuity do not cause customers to stop patronizing businesses.\\"Safe Access Is Good For Business\\", FHWA-HOP-06-107, EDL Number 14294 http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/amprimer/access_mgmt_primer.htm The most authoritative North American reference on the subject is the Access Management Manual (2014) and the Access Management Application Guidelines (2017) published by the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences.The most complete library of information is maintained by the TRB AHB70 Access Management Committee TRB Access Management Committee Home Page; http://www.trb.org/Main/Blurbs/152653.aspx Colorado was the first state to enact legislation in 1979 and to adopt an associated code of practice and regulatory framework. Since that time, transportation agency interest in access management has grown significantly. Principles of access management Access management programs seek to limit and consolidate access along major roadways, while promoting a supporting street system and unified access and circulation systems for development. The result is a roadway that functions safely and efficiently for its useful life, and a more attractive corridor. The goals of access management are accomplished by applying the following principles: 1\\\\. Provide a Specialized Roadway System: Different types of roadways serve different functions. It is important to design and manage roadways according to the primary functions that they are expected to serve. 2\\\\. Limit Direct Access to Major Roadways: Roadways that serve higher volumes of regional through traffic need more access control to preserve their traffic function. Frequent and direct property access is more compatible with the function of local and collector roadways. 3\\\\. Promote Intersection Hierarchy: An efficient transportation network provides appropriate transitions from one classification of roadway to another. For example, freeways connect to arterials through an interchange that is designed for the transition. Extending this concept to other roadways results in a series of intersection types that range from the junction of two major arterial roadways, to a residential driveway connecting to a local street. 4\\\\. Locate Signals to Favor Through Movements: Long, uniform spacing of intersections and signals on major roadways enhances the ability to coordinate signals and to ensure continuous movement of traffic at the desired speed. Failure to carefully locate access connections or median openings that later become signalized, can cause substantial increases in arterial travel times. In addition, poor signal placement may lead to delays that cannot be overcome by computerized signal timing systems. 5\\\\. Preserve the Functional Area of Intersections and Interchanges: The functional area of an intersection or interchange is the area that is critical to its safe and efficient operation. This is the area where motorists are responding to the intersection or interchange, decelerating, and maneuvering into the appropriate lane to stop or complete a turn. Access connections too close to intersections or interchange ramps can cause serious traffic conflicts that result in crashes and congestion. 6\\\\. Limit the Number of Conflict Points: Drivers make more mistakes and are more likely to have collisions when they are presented with the complex driving situations created by numerous conflict points. Conversely, simplifying the driving task contributes to improved traffic operations and fewer collisions. A less complex driving environment is accomplished by limiting the number and type of conflicts between vehicles, vehicles and pedestrians, and vehicles and bicyclists. 7\\\\. Separate Conflict Areas: Drivers need sufficient time to address one set of potential conflicts before facing another. The necessary spacing between conflict areas increases as travel speed increases, to provide drivers adequate perception and reaction time. Separating conflict areas helps to simplify the driving task and contributes to improved traffic operations and safety. 8\\\\. Remove Turning Vehicles from Through Traffic Lanes: Turning lanes allow drivers to decelerate gradually out of the through lane and wait in a protected area for an opportunity to complete a turn. This reduces the severity and duration of conflict between turning vehicles and through traffic and improves the safety and efficiency of roadway intersections. 9\\\\. Use Nontraversable Medians to Manage Left-Turn Movements: Medians channel turning movements on major roadways to controlled locations. Research has shown that the majority of access-related crashes involve left turns. Therefore, nontraversable medians and other techniques that minimize left turns or reduce the driver workload can be especially effective in improving roadway safety. 10\\\\. Provide a Supporting Street and Circulation System: Well-planned communities provide a supporting network of local and collector streets to accommodate development, as well as unified property access and circulation systems. Interconnected street and circulation systems support alternative modes of transportation and provide alternative routes for bicyclists, pedestrians, and drivers. Alternatively, commercial strip development with separate driveways for each business forces even short trips onto arterial roadways, thereby reducing safety and impeding mobility.

It is located on of land on Imperial Highway between the cross streets of Santa Ana Canyon Road and Nohl Ranch Road, and serves students in the Orange Unified School District. The school, which opened its doors in 1973, has a student population of 2,400. The school primarily serves the community of Anaheim Hills as well as parts of East Anaheim and Orange, and was designated a California Distinguished School in 2007 by the California Department of Education.Distinguished School Awards - California Department of Education The school's fight song is Washington and Lee Swing. The school is currently ranked as one of the top 1,000 high schools in the United States by Newsweek at number 128, a distinction given to less than 1% of high schools nationally. It is the 204th highest ranked school in the state of California. History The school started in 1974 as a shared campus with the established Villa Park High School for students in grades 10-12. Upon completion of the Anaheim Hills campus, a variety of names were considered for the site. A ballot of three proposed names was given to the students of Vista Del Rio Jr. High School to vote on. The students did not like any of the choices so a write-in campaign was started. Canyon High School was the name of choice due to its location and the fact that the local students call that area \\"The Canyon\\". Ultimately, the name Canyon High School was selected. Boundary changes in the district and an increase in the population of the Anaheim Hills community resulted in changes at the school. The school was designated to serve students in grades 9 through 12 in 1987, and El Rancho Charter School was designated as the only feeder school within the boundaries of Canyon High School. The school implemented an International Baccalaureate Program in 1988.International Baccalaureate Organization - Canyon High School Education Canyon High School offers a variety of programs for its students including the International Baccalaureate Program, Stellar Technology Program, and Specialized Science Program, in addition to numerous college-level Advanced Placement and Honors courses. Its current API Score is 861, designating the school in the top 10% of all high schools in the state of California. The school focuses on technology, having undergone thousands of dollars worth of upgrading the schools technology, by adding 100 computers, and making 19 of its courses available as online classes.Canyon High School Accountability Report Card In 2019, the U.S. News & World Report ranked the school 387th in the state of California and 2,557th in the United States.

South Andros There are three settlements in the Bahamas called \\"The Bluff\\". The first is on South Andros Island. It is the most densely populated settlement on the island. It hosts a Homecoming every year, the first weekend in June on its Regatta site. Also, the Bluff is home to the 'Government' buildings like the police station, the Post Office and BaTelCo. North Eleuthera The other settlement called \\"The Bluff\\" (or simply \\"Bluff\\") is on the west coast of North Eleuthera Island. In 1783, after he had served with the Pennsylvania Loyalists and the Carolina Rangers, James Kelly (1754-1808), cited as entering the Bahamas via East Florida and accompanied by Hugh Kelly was awarded 500 acres in the vicinity of Bluff, Eleuthera. James Kelly married first Susan Turner then Elizabeth Kemp and had a plantation at Bluff. A plantation house may have been built but the location of its remains is unknown. It seems likely that the Kellys left Bluff. Indeed historic records of Kelly descendants are found at Current, Harbour Island, Nassau all in the Bahamas and Key West, Florida. Records for Kellys of African ancestry, presumably former slaves are also found in the vicinity. History says the settlement was established by emancipated slaves somewhere around 1807/8. By 1849 it exported pineapples and citrus fruit. Louis Diston Powles visited Eleuthera, and in his book The Land of the Pearl (1888) referred to the Bluff settlement and its black residents, most notably John Neely, the tacitly accepted leader of the settlement. The third settlement is on Cat Island. At the National Archives in Nassau, Bahamas, there exists a will from one Christopher Neely, a white slaveholder (a British loyalist originally from South Carolina in the colonies). In his 1807 will he makes specific references to his slaves on Abaco and New Providence Islands. In this will he states that it is his desire that his 24 slaves on Abaco Island be freed upon his death, which came within several months of his will. Possibly this settlement was established by these freed slaves from Abaco Island. The (Eleuthera) Bluff settlement sponsors an annual homecoming event the second weekend of July which generally coincides with the Independence Day celebrations taking place throughout the entire Bahamas.

Biography Slagle was born in Los Angeles and grew up in suburban Philadelphia. He received a scholarship to the Berklee College of Music and received a master's degree in Music From Manhattan School of Music.. He came to New York in 1976, first working with Machito and his Afro-Cuban orchestra, and then toured and recorded with Ray Barretto, Steve Kuhn, Lionel Hampton, Brother Jack McDuff, and Carla Bley. He also performed and traveled with Woody Herman and Cab Calloway. In the mid-1980s, he began leading his own combos, first with Mike Stern and then with Dave Stryker; the combo is currently the main focus of Slagle's music.http://home.nestor.minsk.by/jazz/press/2012/02/2906.html He has also played frequently with Joe Lovano and has featured on several of Lovano's albums, including the Grammy-winning 52nd Street Themes. In the mid-1980s, global and especially Latin influences began to inflect Slagle's work, and he appeared on albums by Milton Nascimento and recorded Rio Highlife in Brazil. He toured frequently worldwide during the 1990s and 2000s, especially in Western Europe, Japan, South America and, latterly, Russia and Bulgaria. During the 1990s, he was a leading figure in the Charles Mingus Big Band. Ever since the late 1990s, Slagle has co-led a band with guitarist Dave Stryker. New New York, his 2000 release, has been seen as an evocation of the city's mood on the verge of 9/11 and an expression of Slagle's love for the city he has made his home. He has played with such diverse artists as Milton Nascimento, St. Vincent, Elvis Costello, the Beastie Boys, and Mac Rebennack (aka Dr. John). Slagle has taught at the Manhattan School of Music, Rutgers, The New School, NYU, and clinics through the Thelonious Monk Institute as well as the Mingus Jazz Workshop and master classes and clinics worldwide. In 2015, his duo recording with pianist Bill O'Connell, a tribute album to Kenny Drew Jr. was released as The Power of Two. In February 2016, Routes (by the Stryker/Slagle Band-Expanded) was released. It was produced by Rick Simpson, with 4-horn arrangements by Steve Slagle. With much critical acclaim, Routes reached #2 on the national radio charts. Slagle plays and endorses Yanagisawa saxophones ‚Äî the WO-10 alto saxophone and S9930 soprano saxophone. Steve has also been a long time player of Haynes flutes. On tenor sax, Steve plays a mid-60's Selmer Mark VI, and on baritone sax, a 1947 Silver Conn. In 2011, Slagle published a composition and improvisation workbook for the creative musician, and stories about his life in \\"Scenes, Songs and Solos\\" (Schaffner Press). His many original compositions are published with Slagle Music, BMI.

Clements lives on Galiano Island, British Columbia. As a writer Marie has worked in a variety of mediums including theatre, performance, film, multi-media, radio, and television.http://www.bravofact.com/2012/12/18/marie-clements/ Early life Clements was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. Early in her life she studied dance, speech, singing, piano, and music, but she dreamed of being a foreign correspondent. She studied journalism at Mount Royal College in Calgary, Alberta. See pp. 147-8.  Career  During the 1980s Clements worked as a radio news reporter and is still a freelance contributor to CBC radio. She has also worked in the writing department of the television series Da Vinci's Inquest which featured a plot line similar to The Unnatural and Accidental Women which is based on the murders of several Native women in Vancouver's Skid Row district. She has been a playwright in residence at the National Theatre School of Canada, the Banff Centre for the Arts, the Firehall Arts Centre, and the National Arts Centre. She has been writer-in-residence at several prominent Canadian universities, including Simon Fraser University and University of British Columbia Theatre Research in Canada (TRIC) dedicated a special issue of the journal to the celebration of Clements's contribution to Canadian theatre. In 2010, Marie Clements founded Working Pajama Lab, which specializes in the development, creation and strategic weaving of story across film, t.v., digital media and live performance. She also founded Red Diva Project the same year when she was commissioned to create the Aboriginal Pavilion's closing performance at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Marie Clements's plays often consider several overlapping themes, such as the themes of racism, sexism, and violence explored in The Unnatural and Accidental Women. Her theatrical style is a blending of Aboriginal storytelling, ritual and western theatrical conventions. As a playwright, director, and dramaturg, she \\"explores important issues of women, aboriginals, and the realities of the urban core in innovative, highly theatrical stagings\\" It was while touring the Canadian north that Clements wrote her first play, Age of Iron (1993). She says it was \\"sheer cold boredom and a serious desire to understand and integrate the elemental connections between Greek mythology and Native thought\\" that inspired her to write the play. See p. 148. Clements's plays often \\"reframe...authorized Western histories\\" to encourage spectators acknowledgement of alternative histories and critically engage with the process of historiography. See p. 50. Both Burning vision (staged by Tom Bentley-Fisher for The Barcelona International Grec Festival) and The Unnatural and Accidental Women engage with elements of Canadian history that are pushed to the periphery and press issues of \\"counter-hegemonic remembrance practices\\" See p. 51. Her importance as a Canadian playwright is reflected in the number of award nominations, the multiple translations of her works, and the number of scholarly articles dedicated to her plays.

The Cheetah's club in San Diego is a full nude club where no alcohol is served. It has achieved notoriety for having been frequented by some of the September 11 hijackers. Las Vegas Club The Las Vegas club was founded in 1991 by Michael Galardi, and employs about 150 dancers. In 2004, Galardi admitted in a San Diego federal trial that he bribed Las Vegas officials in an attempt to influence strip club regulations. In a Las Vegas federal court, he stated that he paid between $200,000 and $400,000. The club is managed by Charles Wright, a retired professional wrestler best known for his stints in World Wrestling Entertainment as a voodoo witch doctor (\\"Papa Shango\\") and as a pimp (\\"The Godfather\\"), and was also part of the factions: the rebooted Nation of Domination and the Million Dollar Corporation, under the name Kama ‚ÄúThe Supreme Fighting Machine‚Äù Mustafa. He also was part of the Right To Censor as The Goodfather. In September 2005, Duke Lloyd Sneddon of Otranto made news by spending $120,000 in one evening at the club.

All recognised types of this landform can be observed, commonly as bornhardts, but also as inselbergs, castle koppies and Nubbins. Rising abruptly from the surrounding landscape they create a variety of microhabitats for plants, and provide seasonal resources and refuge for a range of animals. These areas thus have rich biodiversity and many endemic species. They are significant locations that tie in with the Aboriginal and European cultural heritage of Western Australia.  Ecology  Granite outcrops in the state are ecologically complex and insular, often providing niches for ancient lineages of organisms that are relics of a wetter climate. These niches include unfractured rock surface that is covered in biofilm, composed of cyanobacteria that give massive rockfaces a characteristic colour. Crusts of lichens also appear, visible mats constructed by blue-green alga and fungal associations that may be up to a billion years old. Mats composed primarily of moss and spike-moss are also found when adequate moisture is available, which in turns provides opportunies for other organisms. At least 1300 plant species occur on granite outcrops in Western Australia, many of which are endemic to these sites. Hopper, S.D., Brown, A.P. and Marchant, N.G. (1997) Plants of Western Australian granite outcrops, Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia, vol.80:141‚Äì158 Some of these plant species gain a purchase a clefts and fissures in the rock face, and trees or large shrubs may appear in a bonsai-form. Slabs of rock, split by exfoliation or cracked and pushed up to an A profile, form habitat that is cooler, damper, and secure for plant and animal species that are often specially adapted to the narrow environ. Pools of rainwater known as gnammas often form on granite outcrops. These provide habitat to around 230 aquatic invertebrates, of which at least 50 are endemic to these pools, and provide freshwater to other inhabitants and visitors. Gnamma on Mount Melville, Albany The flora of these granitic outcrops is notable in many regards. Woody species may include tall trees, eucalypts, sheoak, acacia, and rock figs of the genus Ficus, smaller species include these genera and taxa of verticordia, banksia, grevillea, and melaleuca. The number of orchid species occurring on them is 141, and 16% of these are endemic to these landforms. Those orchid species endemic to outcrops may be widely distributed or, as with Spiculaea ciliata, only found at locations separated by a few kilometres. Human use of the outcrops has been well documented,Bayly, I.A.E.

When Long started as pastor for New Birth Church, there were 300 church members, which grew to 25,000. During this time, Long was a subject of a Senate investigation, concerning whether he personally profited from his church's tax-exempt status, which eventually ended without a finding of wrongdoing. Also, civil lawsuits were filed against him alleging sexual abuse of underage male members of his parish. Long denied wrongdoing through his attorneys and privately settled the lawsuits out of court for undisclosed amounts.  Early life and education  Long was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, on May 12, 1953, the son of the Rev. Floyd M. Long, Jr. and Hattie Long. He attended North Carolina Central University in Durham, North Carolina, where he received a bachelor's degree in Business Administration in 1977. In 2008, Long donated $1 million to the university to establish a professorship in his name, saying \\"I am making (the donation) from my own personal income,\\" which comes from various real estate ventures and also as royalties from his books. Long then worked as a factory sales representative for the Ford Motor Corporation, but was fired after he submitted expense reports that included personal telephone calls. Long claimed to hold a doctorate in \\"Pastoral Ministry\\" from the unaccredited International College of Excellence, which is not recognized by either the Council for Higher Education Accreditation or United States Department of Education, the two institutions responsible for recognizing educational accrediting institutions in the United StatesGreat Moments in Accreditation: The Case of IAC, ACI, and The Three Stooges, quackwatch.org, January 19, 2017. Life and ministry Following his dismissal from Ford, he moved to Atlanta to study theology and became the pastor of a small Jonesboro, Georgia church. In 1987 he became the pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, which at the time had around 300 members. Under Long, membership grew to 25,000. The church may be considered part of the Bapticostal movement. Long married Dabara S. Houston in 1981 and they were divorced soon afterwards. The couple have a son, Edward Long. Houston said she was the victim of \\"cruel treatment\\" and was afraid of Long's \\"violent and vicious temper,\\" according to Fulton County Superior Court records. She and her son allegedly \\"had to flee the couple's Fairburn home in order to ensure their safety\\". Long vigorously denied the allegations and in 1985 Houston was awarded custody of the then 2-year-old son. Long married Vanessa Griffin in 1990. After he was accused of sexually molesting young fatherless boys in the church, she filed for divorce in December 2011. On the same day New Birth's public relations firm claimed that she had rethought her decision and would withdraw her petition: \\"Upon further prayerful reflection Vanessa Long is withdrawing the divorce petition.\\" However Griffin's attorneys later confirmed that she would continue with the divorce. In response, Long stated that he would be taking a leave of absence from his ministry in an attempt to save his marriage, and that \\"he needed time to take care of 'some family business.'\\" Later that month, New Birth Christian Academy, founded by Long, announced it was closing due to lack of donations and \\"sending hundreds of students scrambling to find a new school by the following week\\", in the wake of Long's marital and sexual problems. On February 17, 2012, one of Long's lawyers, Lawrence Cooper, confirmed to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Vanessa Long had asked that the divorce petition be dismissed. Cooper declined to say if the Longs were reunited. In an emailed response to the AJC, Vanessa's lawyers declined to comment. On September 5, 2012, during the Heart to Heart Women's Ministry Conference at New Birth, Vanessa Long stated that while she struggled with the decision to divorce Long following those accusations of sexual misconduct with male minors, she chose to return to her marriage and to the New Birth family so she could share her experience and offer guidance for others. Theological beliefs In 1994, Long was given the title \\"bishop\\" in the Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship, a group of black Baptist churches that embraced Pentecostal practices.Blake, John. \\"Titles from God: What's in a title? Quite a lot, to a new generation of pastors who leave 'the Rev.' behind in favor of more elaborate designations.\\" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. January 12, 2002. p. B.1 Long's sermons, writings and teachings emphasize a \\"chain of command\\" between certain superiors and subordinates characterized by \\"respect, submission and obedience\\". Long saw the first link in the chain as being a man choosing to be respectful, submissive and obedient to God. A woman chooses to be respectful, submissive and obedient to her father or husband. To live otherwise is to be outside of the divinely established order, and will result in the loss of spiritual and natural benefits. Long was considered a preacher of the prosperity gospel who taught that his followers would be blessed with material wealth. Career events In 2006, Long was chosen by the family of Martin Luther King, Jr. to host and officiate the funeral for Mrs. Coretta Scott King, wife of the late civil rights pioneer. The event was attended by four Presidents (George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Jimmy Carter). Long was a prominent supporter of George W. Bush's faith- based initiatives. His ministry received a million dollar grant from the U.S. Administration for Children & Families. Rev. Timothy McDonald suggested a link between Long's anti-gay activity and the grant saying \\"If you look at the black pastors who have come out with the faith-based money, they're the same ones who have come out with campaigns on the gay marriage issue.\\" On January 31, 2012, a video was released depicting a ceremony at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church wherein Messianic Jewish preacher Ralph Messer presented a Torah scroll to Long, wrapped him in it, and symbolically elevated him to a position of spiritual kingship before a cheering congregation. Some Jewish leaders objected and characterized the ceremony as disrespectful to the Jewish faith and traditions. Controversies Salary and Senate investigation In 2005, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that between 1997 and 2000, Long received more than $3.07 million worth of compensation and benefits from his non-profit charity, 'Bishop Eddie Long Ministries Inc.' Long contended that the charity did not solicit donations from members but instead gained its income from royalties, speaking fees and several large donations. In 2007 a three-year investigation by the United States Senate Committee on Finance into the tax-exempt status of six ministries, including Long's, concluded that there were no definitive findings of wrongdoing. Donations to the church dropped significantly following the investigation of Long's salary and church finances. Teaching regarding sexual orientation CNN has said \\"Long frequently denounces homosexual behavior.\\" Long has ministered \\"homosexual cure\\" programs to recruit gays and lesbians for what he called \\"Sexual Reorientation\\" conferences and his church offers an ongoing \\"Out of the Wilderness\\" ministry to help convert homosexuals into heterosexuals. In 2004, Long led a march with Bernice King to the grave of her father, Martin Luther King, Jr. The march was a protest against same-sex marriage and in support of a national constitutional amendment to limit marriage rights to couples comprising \\"one man and one woman.\\" In 2006, Long's appearance at Atlanta's Interdenominational Theological Center's spring graduation led to Black theologian James Cone‚Äîwho was scheduled to receive an honorary degree‚Äîto boycott the ceremony. Thirty-three graduating seniors sent a letter to the seminary's president \\"questioning Long's theological and ethical integrity to be their commencement speaker.\\" Many students did not agree with Long's beliefs that God can \\"deliver\\" homosexuals and his teachings on prosperity. A 2007 article in the Southern Poverty Law Center's magazine called him \\"one of the most virulently homophobic black leaders in the religiously based anti‚Äìgay movement.\\" Allegations of sexual impropriety and lawsuits In September 2010, Maurice Robinson, Anthony Flagg, Jamal Parris and Spencer LeGrande filed separate lawsuits alleging that Long used his pastoral influence to coerce them into sexual relationships with him. The plaintiffs state that Long placed the men on the church's payroll, bought them cars and other gifts, including overseas trips. The lawsuits stated that Long would \\"discuss the Holy Scripture to justify and support the sexual activity.\\" Long denied the allegations through his attorneys and spokesman. In a prepared statement, Long said, \\"I have devoted my life to helping others and these false allegations hurt me deeply.\\" On September 26, Long spoke to the New Birth congregation but he did not address the issue directly. Long spoke of painful times and said, \\"I've been accused. I'm under attack. I want you to know, as I said earlier, I am not a perfect man, but this thing, I'm going to fight.\\" Long's unwillingness to address the accusations directly prompted a group of over 70 people, headed by the pastor of a small church in South Carolina, to hold a protest rally on the steps of the Georgia state Capitol on October 31, 2010, calling for Long's resignation. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in May 2011, that the lawsuits were settled out of court; terms were undisclosed. Later on, media outlets indicated that Centino Kemp was the fifth accuser who also settled. On May 30, 2011, an episode of the documentary series Sex Scandals In ReligionSex Scandals In Religion, vibe.com. aired on Canadian television network VisionTV. It took an investigative look at the allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior by Long with young men in his care. Weight loss and death In August 2016, Long received major attention on Twitter when he posted a video on Facebook of himself which showed his drastic weight loss. In the video, he said he was eating \\"raw vegetables\\" instead of a \\"slave menu\\" and that he was not on any medications. In September 2016, Long issued a statement saying he was \\"recovering\\" from an unspecified illness and that the illness was \\"unrelated\\" to his diet. Long died on January 15, 2017, at the age of 63. The church issued a statement describing the cause of death as an \\"aggressive form of cancer\\".

McHugh was born in Nevada, MissouriWashington, Passenger and Crew Lists, 1882-1965 and graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1922. Following training at Quantico he went to China in 1923 to study the country and its language. His father-in-law, Jacob Gould Schurman, who was president of Cornell University from 1892‚Äì1920, was then American minister to China. McHugh spent over twenty years in China, where he served as intelligence officer for the 4th Marines and U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Shanghai, from 1933‚Äì1935, became special Assistant Naval Attach√©, American Embassy at Nanking, Hankow, and Chungking. He was Naval Attach√© and Naval Attach√© for Air from 1940‚Äì1943, serving as a special representative of Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, with whom he was a close friend. For his work in this capacity he was awarded the Legion of Merit. He was officer in charge of the Far East Secret Intelligence and served on the staff of the Fifth Amphibious Corps (G-5), was sent to Guam in 1944 to help plan the attack on Iwo Jima. An attack of malaria led to his recall in 1943; after which he was assigned to Navy Department, to one of the forerunners of the present CIA. In October 1942, McHugh encouraged Chiang Kai-shek to seek the replacement of Joseph Stilwell with Claire Lee Chennault. While returning to the United States, McHugh visited Archibald Wavell, criticized Stilwell severely, and spoke favorably of Chennault's claim that Japan could be defeated by a small American air force based in China. This infuriated George Marshall, the Army Chief of Staff, who believed that McHugh's indiscretion irreparably damaged the American war strategy in southeast Asia and China. After retirement in 1946, he was an economic consultant for corporations having interest in the Far East, including Jardine, Matheson & Co. (Hong Kong), and Balfour, Guthrie & Co. (New York).

Rowe was well known for his work on the genes and the environment: how they interact, what the limits of environment and genes might be, and what mechanisms implement these effects. He also focussed on articulating the different realms of the social environment: shared in families, unique to individuals, neighbourhood or nation level social and cultural effects. His book The Limits of Family Influence: Genes, Experience and BehaviourD. C. Rowe. (1994). The Limits of Family Influence: Genes, Experience and Behaviour . Guilford Press. London brought together much of this work. This work led to several substantive findings on shared and nonshared environmental influences; seminal work on the heritability of parenting behaviors (the genetics of the environment for children); on the heritability of antisocial behavior; race differences and their causes; for testing the interaction of education, and social class with genes in the development of intelligence; and for blending behavioral and molecular genetics. He made several methodological contributions, including work on modeling of means and covariances with raw data, the utility of the DeFries‚ÄìFulker analysis, and measured genes and environmental influences. The Add Health data featured in much of his research, and he served as the main geneticist on this large and influential survey of over 90,000 adolescents across the United States. Rowe's work highlighted the often surprising immunity of mental states to social circumstances, reporting that \\"great fortune does not guarantee happiness; neither does great misfortune assure depression\\".D. C. Rowe. (2001). \\"Do people make environments or do environments make people?\\" Ann N Y Acad Sci, 935, 62‚Äì74.] This led to his positing of biological set points as a mechanism for stability, as well as arguing for indirect genetic effects: that different genotypes would cause different people to react to the same environment in different ways, and, moreover, that individuals expose themselves to different social environments. This led to ideas about active seeking and environment construction, as well the idea that exposure to (controllable) life events may result partly from genetic predisposition. He was an advocate of Consilience: including biological individuality along with social, psychological, and cultural factors in any understanding of human behavior. In 1994 he was one of 52 signatories on \\"Mainstream Science on Intelligence,Gottfredson, Linda (December 13, 1994). Mainstream Science on Intelligence.

He first achieved international success in 1986, as the singer and front man of the duo Double with the hit single, \\"The Captain of Her Heart\\". Biography Kurt Meier was born in Zurich, Switzerland, as the only child of Arnold and Babette Meier. His father's family emigrated to France when Arnold was four years old. During World War II, his father returned to Switzerland, where he met Babette, a daughter of a locomotive driver, and married her. Her family was very musical; each played an instrument and performed at house concerts. When Meier was born, Babette used to play the mandolin and sing and dance for him, and later, when he started to play the guitar, jammed along with her. The early days At school, Meier was part of several bands that performed in local competition festivals, playing covers from The Beatles to Cream. From 1969 to 1972, he attended the Swiss Business School, but, after receiving his degree, chose a career as a conceptual artist and painter. He exhibited his works at local galleries in Zurich and founded, along with three artist friends, the performance group MAEZ. At his own gallery openings, Kurt Meier, who changed his name to Kurt Maloo in 1975, always played the electric guitar. The solo performances metamorphosed into a band, including two other members of MAEZ. But Troppo, true to its name, grew to a nine-piece fusion art-punk band, influenced mainly by the New York Dolls and Funkadelic. After its first show at the Rote Fabrik in 1976, Troppo became a cult act in Switzerland in the mid to late 1970s.Grand, Lurker, et al. (2007). Hot Love: Swiss Punk & Wave 1976‚Äì1980.

A year later, he teamed up with publisher Peter Zumsteg and released a hybrid format vinyl record with the title Luna, Luna + 7 Notorious Maloo Homeworks. On the A-side was one song spinning at 45 rpm and on the B-side, seven more at 33 rpm. The A-side song was a studio recording, while the B-side was recorded at home on his Revox B-77, using the ping-pong technique to simulate multitrack recording. Ping Pong He continued to play solo concerts until he met Felix Haug, later the other half of Double. Haug used to play drums with the Swiss techno band Yello. He joined Maloo and, with the addition of a bass player, they formed the trio, Ping Pong. With the help of publisher Peter Zumsteg, they got the chance to record four songs at the Roxy Music studio with guitarist Phil Manzanera as producer, but the tracks never got released. When they signed with Teldec's label Big Mouth, they re-recorded the tracks together with new material for their album From Exile (1982). The band played in numerous European festivals, including the renowned Montreux Jazz Festival. Double In 1983, Kurt Maloo and Felix Haug decided to make a go of it as a duo. As Double, they released three 12\\" maxi singles‚Äî\\"Naningo\\" (1983), \\"Rangoon Moon\\" and \\"Woman of the World\\" (1984)‚Äîbefore they had a chance to record their first album. The black-and-white music video for \\"Rangoon Moon\\" became a cult clip in Europe and received airplay on VH1 in the United States. Two years later, Double became known worldwide with their first hit single, \\"The Captain of Her Heart\\" from their first album, Blue, a best-seller that has been released in more than fifty countries. \\"The Captain of Her Heart\\" became a modern-day classic. In 1987, Kurt Maloo and Felix Haug recorded their second and last album, Dou3le, visualized best in the performance of the legendary Swiss mime group Mummenschanz in the award-winning music video for their song \\"Devils Ball\\", featuring Herb Alpert on trumpet. Double started to work on a third album in late 1988, but, due to artistic differences, disbanded a few months later. Solo career Maloo continued his career solo again and released, under his own name, Single (1990), Soul & Echo (1995), Loopy Avenue (2006), Summer of Better Times (2009) and \\"What About (2014)\\". Since 2007, he has been performing with his own band and played several concerts and festivals, including NuNote Lounge Fest in Moscow. Personal life In 1986, Maloo met his future wife, Anja Muller, a fashion model from Hamburg, Germany. Together, they moved to Paris, France, where they lived for seven years and where their daughter was born in 1991. They then relocated to Hamburg, Muller's hometown, where their son was born in 1994 and where they still live.

It breeds in highlands from northwestern Mexico to northwestern Ecuador. The olive flycatcher (Mitrephanes olivaceus) of Peru and Bolivia is now considered a separate species. It is a common inhabitant of mature mountain forest and tall second growth, especially at edges and clearings with trees. It breeds from 700‚Äì3000 m altitude, but is most abundant from 1200‚Äì2150 m. The female builds a saucer nest of moss, liverworts and lichens 4‚Äì27 m high on a branch or vine, usually concealed among ferns, bromeliads and other epiphytes. The female incubates the two brown-blotched white eggs for 15‚Äì16 days to hatching, The northern tufted flycatcher is 12 cm long and weighs 8.5 g. The upperparts are olive-green, including the pointed crest. The tail and wings are blackish, and the latter have two buff wing bars and buff edging to the secondary feathers. The breast is ochre-orange, shading to bright yellow on the belly. Sexes are similar, but young birds have brownish upperparts with buff fringing, orange wing bars and paler underparts. The northern tufted flycatcher is usually seen in pairs, hunting flying insects from an open perch like a pewee. It often returns to the same perch and vibrates its tail as it lands. This species has a rapid weet weet weet weet call. Its dawn song is a very fast high bip-bip-bip-dididiup-bip-bip-bibibiseer. Although this species is not migratory, it is very rare vagrant to the United States, the first record being from Big Bend National Park, Texas in November 1991. It has also been observed in Arizona.

She was one of a handful of World War II AKAs manned by officers and crew from the United States Coast Guard. She served as a commissioned ship for 2 years and 6 months. Centaurus was launched on 3 September 1943 by Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Kearny, New Jersey, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. J. L. Wilson; acquired by the Navy 20 October 1943; and commissioned the next day, Captain G. E. McCabe, USCG, in command. Service history 1943-1944 Centaurus put to sea from Norfolk, Virginia on 11 December 1943 with cargo for Pearl Harbor, where she arrived 30 December. On 22 January 1944, she cleared with the Southern Attack Force, bound for Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, off which she arrived 31 January. During the initial assault, she landed four waves of cargo-laden craft under the protective fire of with a smoothness belying her newness at amphibious warfare, and until 5 February she remained off the atoll landing combat cargo to support troops ashore as they encountered stiffening opposition. She returned to Noumea for training and cargo duty until 31 March, when she sailed from Tulagi to carry men and cargo to Manus and proceeded to Langemak Bay, New Guinea. Here she loaded for the landings on northern New Guinea, and on 15 April put to sea in the second assault echelon for Aitape. While her landings here on 23 April were unopposed, difficult surf and beach conditions challenged her skill. After several brief voyages to other New Guinea ports to transport reinforcements to the Hollandia area, Centaurus sailed for amphibious exercises in the Solomon Islands. From 3 June to 30 June 1944, she was at sea as part of the reserve force standing by during the invasion of the Marianas, and then returned to Eniwetok to prepare for the return of U.S. forces to Guam. She sailed on 17 July in the Southern Attack Force for this assault, and on 21 July, the day of the initial attack, began landing combat cargo on the difficult beaches near Agat, where the Japanese army offered stiff resistance. She completed offloading cargo and vehicles, and embarking casualties, a week later, when she cleared for Eniwetok. After a brief overhaul at Espiritu Santo, Centaurus sailed to Guadalcanal to embark cargo and vehicles for the assault on the Palau Islands, for which she cleared 8 September. At Peleliu on 15 September 1944 she began landing her cargo as heavy opposition developed from the Japanese defenses, cleverly concealed. A fierce fight developed ashore for the Marines, and Centaurus remained off the island pouring ashore the equipment essential to the maintenance of the offensive. Taking on board casualties and prisoners of war, she also carried Marines when she cleared on 4 October for the Russell Islands, where all passengers were disembarked. She continued on to San Francisco, where from 25 October to 22 December she was in overhaul. 1945-1946 Centaurus returned to the Pacific by way of Guam, and after rehearsal landings in the Solomons, joined the Northern Attack Force for the invasion of Okinawa, with which she sailed from Ulithi 27 March 1945. Arriving off the island for the assault on 1 April, she began to discharge cargo at an ever-quickening pace, as she supported the first rapid advances of the 6th Marines across the island. Operations went smoothly despite heavy kamikaze attacks; her guns helped splash two. She cleared Okinawa 9 April for Pearl Harbor, where she loaded additional cargo for the Okinawa operation. Returning to Okinawa 3 June, she offloaded, and on 14 June sailed for mainland United States via Pearl Harbor, and between 19 July and 23 August was in after overhaul at Seattle. She returned to the Far East and operated in the redeployment of troops. On 31 January 1946 she returned to Seattle and thence to New York City, where she arrived on 23 March and was decommissioned 30 April 1946. She returned to the Maritime Commission 11 September 1946. On 24 February 1947 she was withdrawn from the Reserve Fleet and transferred to United States Lines.

In the , Collinsville had a population of 1,248 people.  Geography  Collinsville is in the coal-rich Bowen Basin region of Central Queensland, north of Brisbane and south-west of the coastal town of Bowen. The Bowen Developmental Road passes through the town connecting with Bowen to the north-east and the Gregory Highway at Belyando Crossing to the south-west. The Newlands railway system passes through Collinsville serving local mines. The line passes through the town itself but the Collinsville railway station is only a siding near the junction of Station Street and Railway Road ().  History  Biri (Birri) is an Aboriginal language of Central Queensland and North Queensland. Biri refers to a language chain extending from Central Queensland towards Townsville and is often used as a universal name for other languages and/or dialects across the region. The language area includes the towns of Bowen, Ayr, Collinsville and Nebo. European settlement of the region began in 1861 with the opening of the lands to pastoralists, with some cattle stations still in operation. Coal was discovered in 1866 but it was not until 1912 that large-scale mining operations commenced. The town was originally known as Moongunya, an aboriginal word that roughly translates to place of coal. On 20 September 1921 it was officially renamed Collinsville after Charles Collins who was the Labor Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Bowen from 1915 to 1936. Collinsville State School opened on 27 June 1921. Collinsville Post Office opened on 21 May 1923 (a receiving office had been open from 1922). The St John Bosco Catholic School was established in 1936 under the Sisters of Mercy. The school is named after Saint John Bosco, a Roman Catholic priest who devoted himself to the betterment of children through love and education. On 13 October 1954, seven men were killed in the deepest part of the Collinsville State Coal Mine about 1.5 kilometres from the entrance of the No. 1 tunnel, when an outburst dislodged 900 tonnes of earth. The Collinsville mine disaster was the largest loss of life in a Queensland mine since the Mount Mulligan mine disaster in 1921. Collinsville State High School opened on 28 January 1986. In the 2011 census, Collinsville had a population of 1,501 people. In the , Collinsville had a population of 1,248 people.  Heritage listings  Collinsville has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Collinsville-Scottville Road: Collinsville Cemetery * Strathbowen-Leichhardt Range Road: Bowen River Hotel Economy The town is home to a number of coal mines. This includes the Collinsville coal mine and the Sonoma Mine. These provide significant employment to the town and surrounding areas. The town is expected to grow further with the development of more mining related projects, and green energy such as solar power are shaping up to be an important job creating industry for Collinsville. It is also hoped a new road to Proserpine will be built. This will enable faster travel between the town and the coastal plain, and will also open up new opportunities for land development and export.  Facilities  Facilities in four churches (Catholic, Anglican, Uniting, Assembly of God), a pharmacy, a district hospital, some shops and sporting facilities. Sporting facilities include a golf course, rugby league grounds, tennis courts, a public swimming pool, squash courts, and lawn bowls. The town has one newsagent, a bakery, two fuel stations, two medium size grocery stores, two places to buy clothing and a hardware shop. The Whitsunday Regional Council operates the Collinsville Library, located on 37 Conway Street, Collinsville. The Collinsville Library was opened in 1982. The Collinsville branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at 33 Conway Street.  Education  Collinsville has two primary schools, Collinsville State School and St John Bosco's Catholic Primary School and the Collinsville State High School. In 2014, the Collinsville State School had an enrolment of 42 students with 4 teachers. In 2014, the Collinsville State High School had an enrolment of 77 students with 12 teachers (11 full-time equivalent).

It was formed in 1930-31 by combining the operations of the five major interurban systems in central Indiana into one entity. The predecessor companies came under the control of Midland Utilities, owned by Samuel Insull. It was Insull's plan to transform the Indiana interurban network into a new Indiana Railroad by modernizing the profitable routes and abandoning the unprofitable ones. With the onset of the Great Depression, the Insull empire collapsed and the Indiana Railroad was left with a decaying infrastructure and little hope for overcoming the growing competition of the automobile for passenger business and the truck for freight business. The IR faced bankruptcy in 1933, and receiver Bowman Elder was designated to run the company. Payments on bonded debt were suspended. Elder was able to keep the system virtually intact for four years, and IR operated about of interurban lines throughout Indiana during this period. During the late 1930s, the routes were abandoned one by one until a 1941 wreck with fatalities south of Indianapolis put an abrupt end to the last operation of interurbans in Indiana. Predecessor interurban companies Map of the Indiana Railroad showing predecessor lines. The late 1890s was a time of horse-drawn carriages and wagons pulled along unpaved streets and roads, so the arrival of the town streetcar was appreciated. Some of these trolley lines eventually expanded into the countryside and by 1911 grew into hundreds of miles of interurban lines networked across Indiana. \\"When before we had moved by horse and carriage, we now rode on plush seats to places , , even distant.\\"Rowsome: quotation p128; p138, photo of Indianapolis Traction Terminal in 1926 with its nine loading tracks, 7 million passengers a year, 500 scheduled trains; p178, photo of former Indiana Service now an Indiana Railroad steel combine at speed with dust flying approaching Terre Haute. In 1930, this unprofitable network became the new Indiana Railroad interurban. The plan was to increase both passenger and freight business and improve efficiency. A brief description of these IR predecessor interurban companies follows. Union Traction Company The Indiana Railroad was created on July 2, 1930, when Midland Utilities purchased the Union Traction Company of Indiana and transferred ownership to IR. Union Traction (UTC) was the largest interurban system in Indiana with of interurban trackage and of streetcar lines in Anderson, Elwood, Marion and Muncie. UTC was created in 1897 to operate an initial line between Anderson and Alexandria, and in 1902 came under the control of the Schoepf-McGowan Syndicate. UTC purchased or leased several neighboring interurban lines in short order: the Elwood and Alexandria was bought in 1903, the Indiana Northern in 1905, and the Indiana Muncie Hartford and Fort Wayne was leased in 1906. In 1906 UTC also purchased all of the Dayton and Muncie's trackage in Indiana. In 1910, UTC had a very bad wreck at Kingsland. Two wood bodied cars impacted head on, with one \\"telescoping\\" into the other, resulting in over forty fatalities.Rowsome: p131, photo of deadly Union Traction Kingsland wreck; p180, Union Traction publicity photograph of new passenger combine #427 called \\"Hoosierland.\\" This is considered the worst accident in the history of interurban transit. UTC absorbed the Indianapolis, New Castle, and Toledo in 1912 and extended its trackage from New Castle to Muncie, but it did not reach Toledo. Although it attempted a passenger revival with the purchase of new equipment, UTC went into decline in the 1920s along with the other Indiana interurban systems. In 1925, it entered receivership whereby it continued operating by delaying paying interest on its bonded debt. It survived this bankruptcy whole and passed into IR control in 1930 intact. Interstate Public Service At the same time as UTC was acquired, three other systems already owned by Midland Utilities were put under the control of IR. The largest was the Interstate Public Service Company (IPS), which was reorganized as an independent company known as Public Service Company of Indiana, but was operated under the auspices of IR. The IPS operated the line from Indianapolis to Louisville, which had been built between 1896 and 1907 under a variety of small independent lines. Through service between Indianapolis and Louisville was inaugurated over these separate lines in 1908, but it was not until 1912 that ownership of the different segments was consolidated and IPS was created. During the 1920s, IPS modernized its fleet of cars extensively. It operated extensive passenger services from Indianapolis to Louisville and operated suburban services around Louisville. By 1930 it was one of the strongest of the Indiana interurban lines. IPS operated three-car overnight sleeper trains each way between Indianapolis and Louisville during the years before the Great Depression. The all-steel interurban sleeper cars, with traction controls and motors removed, were purchased and used into the 1960s by British Columbia Railway. [Classic Trains, 2008] Indiana Service Corporation At the same time IPS became part of IR, the Indiana Service Corporation (ISC) did as well. ISC was the successor to the Fort Wayne and Wabash Valley Traction Company, a system that had been assembled from smaller predecessors around 1902. The FW&WV; had gone into bankruptcy following the terrible Kingsland wreck of 1910, the worst interurban disaster ever, which had killed 41 people. It had been reorganized as the Fort Wayne and Northern Indiana, and it was this company that failed in 1919 and was purchased by ISC. ISC had also acquired two other lines, the Fort Wayne and Northwestern and the Marion and Bluffton Traction Company, in 1924 and 1926, respectively. In the 1920s, IPS purchased a group of heavy steel combines and coaches (class 400) from St. Louis Car Company. ISC was absorbed into IR essentially intact, with only the Battle Ground branch having been previously abandoned. The 400 class ISC cars were operated by Indiana Railroad along with IR's new high speed cars until abandonment. One of the combines was eventually purchased by the CSS&SB; South Shore Line, where it still operates today as a catenary maintenance car. Northern Indiana Power Absorbed into IR along with ISC and IPS was the Northern Indiana Power Company, which was a successor to the old Kokomo Marion and Western Traction Company. This line was the smallest and weakest of the companies that were folded into IR. Terre Haute Indianapolis and Eastern It was not until a year later, on June 23, 1931, that the final piece of the IR system was added when the Terre Haute Indianapolis and Eastern (THI&E;) was purchased at auction. The THI&E; was the second-largest interurban system in Indiana, operating just over of interurban lines as well as streetcar service in several western Indiana cities. It operated branches out of Indianapolis west to Terre Haute and Brazil, to the university town of Lafayette, and east to Richmond. It stretched nearly from the eastern to the western boundaries of the state. Due to lack of operating revenue and funds, it had never modernized (as had Union Traction, for example), and was financially among the weakest of the Indiana lines. As a power utility it had profits, but the interurban division had been losing money for a decade. It fell into receivership (a form of bankruptcy where the company continues to operate but does not pay interest on its bonded debt) in 1930, and several major branches, including lines to Danville, Martinsville, Lafayette, Crawfordsville, Sullivan and Clinton were abandoned prior to absorption by IR in 1931. Its Indianapolis to Richmond line connecting with the Dayton and Western interurban was a very important IR link to the Ohio interurbans for interchange of freight. From 1930 to 1938, the Indiana Railroad and the Cincinnati and Lake Erie were very important to each other. IR quickly retired the very dated THI&E; arch-windowed wood combines.Rowsome: p124, photo of arch window wood THE&E; combine.Bradley: entire book, details of the design and construction of new lightweights; line abandonments; 1941 Seymour wreck that forced total abandonment.Keenan: p63, the vital Indiana Railroad-Dayton and Western Richmond, Indiana, connection which provided valuable freight interchange to the C&LE; at Dayton, Ohio. The essential Dayton and Western connection As mentioned above, the Indiana Railroad was able to interchange passengers and considerable freight with the very busy Cincinnati and Lake Erie interurban in Ohio, but the financially very weak Dayton and Western interurban was the essential rail link between the two companies. The 53 mile D&W; tied into IR tracks at its west end at Richmond, Indiana, and into C&LE; tracks at its eastern end at Dayton, Ohio. The D&W; connection allowed the IR to ship freight from Indiana to Dayton, and from there on the C&LE; north to Toledo and Cleveland, south to Cincinnati, and east to Columbus. Like many interurbans, the Dayton and Western struggled financially into the 1930s. Its track ran adjacent to the new U.S. Route 40 highway between Richmond and Dayton, and as the 1920s passed, the Dayton and Western crews apprehensively watched as more and more of their business moved onto that highway in the form of cars, trucks, and buses. From 1931 to 1933, the Cincinnati & Lake Erie leased the D&W; to prop it up, and later in 1936, the IR took over the lease, but in May 1937 it had to drop the lease for lack of funds. Thus the D&W; was forced to abandon operations. The resulting loss of revenue business to Ohio wounded the IR. In the good national economy of the early 1920s, the Terre Haute, Indianapolis, & Eastern (the predecessor to the IR on the Indianapolis to Richmond route) had combined with the D&W; to run well-patronized express passenger interurbans and to interchange considerable freight the entire 108 miles between Dayton and Indianapolis, but those good days were over by the late 1920s. Inherited rolling stock This Fort Wayne & Wabash Valley all wood heavy interurban is typical of the numerous pre-1910 wood combines which were inherited by IR. IR inherited a very large fleet of interurban cars from its various predecessor companies, totaling perhaps 100-150 interurban cars (of which about 60 were retained), probably 200 or so streetcars (of which about 150 were retained), around 50 pieces of freight equipment and about 55 work cars of various types. The interurban cars varied considerably in age and design. A number of pre-1910 very large arch-windowed wooden combines that had survived in service on ISC and THI&E; were disposed of within the first couple of years of IR's existence, leaving a fleet made up predominantly of heavy steel single-ended combines.Bradley. Complete IR history. Details of design and construction of lightweights. Line abandonments and 1941 Seymour wreck that forced total abandonment. There were about half a dozen 400 class ISC combines, 30 UTC steel combines (including 15 modern cars only five years old), and nine of Interstate IPS's handsome heavyweight combines, parlor and sleeping cars. A few of these former Interstate cars were still operated by a British Columbia railroad in the 1990s. (Classic Trains Magazine, Sept 2008.) The city cars, excluding earlier wooden types that were scrapped, consisted mainly of single- truck Birney cars inherited from UTC and THI&E.; The only exceptions were a handful of double-truck cars left over from UTC and from IPS's suburban Louisville operations. The freight and work equipment was a hodgepodge of mainly homebuilt designs, outdated passenger cars converted for alternate use, and secondhand equipment. Most of this equipment was quite old, but even some equipment dating to before 1905 remained in IR's employ for years. Some of the retired passenger coaches that were in better condition were rebuilt into box motors and utility cars. New rolling stock Car number 65, now preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum, was built for IR by Pullman in 1931. IR purchased two series of modern interurban cars during its life, and it was the first series - the famed Indiana Railroad High-Speeds - that always symbolized the railroad. When IR was created, its owners knew that they would have to modernize their fleet of interurban cars if they hoped to prevent further erosion of their ridership. In 1930 and 1931, IR designed a series of lightweight, low center of gravity, high-speed interurban cars that could operate quickly and economically on the far-flung IR network. The new cars owed much to the Cincinnati and Lake Erie lightweight cars built a year before. They were single-ended, low-floor cars designed for operation by a single man and were built largely of aluminum to save weight and, therefore, require less power to operate. The biggest difference from the C&LE; cars was in the trucks: whereas the C&LE; cars had smaller arch-bar trucks, the IR cars were designed with heavy Commonwealth cast steel trucks designed specifically for high-speed service and to cope with poor light rail track. A total of 35 cars was ordered. The first 14, cars 50-63, came from the American Car and Foundry and were deluxe cars with coach seating at the front and parlor car chairs at the back. The remaining 21 cars, numbered 64-84, came from Pullman and had all coach seating with a small baggage section at the rear. Delivery of the new high-speeds began in July 1931 and they were an immediate success, making it possible for IR to reduce running times on some of its routes and economize on its operations. The second series of new cars was a group of ten Cummings-built lightweight cars that were bought in 1935. They were not brand new; they had been constructed in 1930 for the Northern Indiana Railway but had been seized by Cummings when the Northern Indiana couldn't pay for them. These cars were numbered 90-99. Freight operation Although considerable planning and expenditure in 1930 was going into improving the passenger operation, it was hoped to increase revenue from the IR's freight business. Less-than-carload (LCL) overnight deliveries between the various IR-linked towns (and to or from Ohio) was not available from the competing railroads; the latter typically required two to three days to complete a shipment. An example is delivering machined parts made in Terre Haute overnight to Fort Wayne auto manufacturer Auburn. Prior to 1930, cartage business already existed due to the interurban's ties to local power companies. At night the IR's arch windowed wood bodied box motors would rumble down the quiet brick streets of an Indiana town towing one or two gondolas loaded with coal for the local power plant. In some cases, freight trains operating on city streets became an objection of town councils, particularly if those trains operated during the day. Many merchants, newspapers, and small manufacturing companies used the frequent interurban scheduling provided. Had this freight business increased with an improving economy along with the greater sales generated by a motivated sales force, the IR would have had a promising future. The idea was a good one, but the national economy didn't improve. Instead, it collapsed further. When the Indiana Railroad lost its important freight interchange connection with neighboring interurban Dayton and Western (which connected at Dayton with the busy Cincinnati and Lake Erie interurban to the Ohio towns of Toledo, Cincinnati, Springfield, and Columbus) prospects for the line's survival were poor. The C&LE; abandoned operations in early 1938 when it lost its interurban connection to Cleveland. The IR continued to barely survive with just Indiana freight business, but its lines were abandoned one by one. Today, one operation on IR track survives as the Southern Indiana Railroad between Speed and Watson Jct handling concrete from Essroc Cement for interchange with the CSX/B&O; at Watson trains using diesel locomotives. Decline In its startup years just before the beginning of the unexpected Great Depression, the Indiana Railroad obtained funds for improving its physical plant and purchasing new interurban coaches and freight equipment. These funds were obtained by selling corporate stock and bonds. Interest was to be paid on the bonds semi-annually from operating income along with paying normal rail operating and business expenses, but the company's operating income declined and eventually became inadequate to repay the bond interest. This forced an eventual declaration of bankruptcy. The public's desire to travel by interurban diminished as the Depression deepened, plus more roads were being paved with more cars driven on them. On July 28, 1933, IR went into bankruptcy but continued to operate. Control was placed by bankruptcy court into the hands of receiver Bowman Elder. Elder was able to keep the system virtually intact for four more years with increasing income from freight. The IR was operating about of interurban lines throughout Indiana during this period. In 1936, IR actually showed an operating profit: the only time in its history that it did so. In that year, the IR found it necessary in order to maintain an essential freight business to Dayton, brought under its control the Dayton and Western, which it leased for two years. This continued its valuable freight link to the very active Cincinnati and Lake Erie Ohio interurban which ran from Cincinnati through Dayton to Toledo and east to Cleveland using the Lake Shore Electric interurban. The IR and the C&LE; moved much freight at the time to Cleveland. When the Lakeshore Electric was abandoned, severing the ability to ship to Cleveland, the C&LE; soon stopped running too.Middleton.

The Dayton and Western provided a connection from the IR to the C&LE.; Eventually, the IR did not have the funds to continue to lease the D&W.; The lease was dropped, the D&W; shut down, and the important freight connection was lost. In 1937 the final slide into bankruptcy began. By order of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Midland Utilities was dissolved and the interurban lines it controlled were divorced from the subsidy income of their parent electric power generating company. In March 1937, the line abandonments began. The old Indiana Service Corporation ISC lines from Fort Wayne north to Waterloo, Garrett and Kendallville were abandoned on March 15. On May 9, the former THI&E; line east of Indianapolis to Richmond was abandoned. This severed the IR's important connection with the Ohio C&LE; interurban network and hurt both the IRR and the C&LE; by ending their interchange business. In September 1938, the former Union Traction line from Indianapolis to Fort Wayne via Peru was abandoned leaving the more southern Indianapolis to Ft Wayne via Muncie route intact. A year later, the major trunk of the former Interstate Public Service Indianapolis to Louisville line was cut back to Seymour. In January 1940, the former THI&E; line west of Indianapolis to Brazil, Greencastle and Terre Haute was abandoned. On January 18, 1941, the remaining Union Traction Indianapolis to Fort Wayne and Bluffton and Muncie to New Castle branch were abandoned, ending practically all service on the IR.Keenan. Indiana Railroad connection at Richmond, Indiana, for essential freight business interchange to C&LE; interurban using Dayton and Western. The final operation, Indianapolis to Seymour, was abandoned following a fatal wreck of a passenger car and a freight motor. End of service Azalia Indiana wreck With the abandonment of its two principal remaining lines in January 1941, the IR was essentially gone. The name IR ceased to be used and the one remaining stub of serviceable trackage, between Indianapolis and Seymour along the old IPS (Interstate) to Louisville route, continued to be operated under the Public Service Company of Indiana name. This service was operated with just two of the high-speed cars (the balance were scrapped at the Anderson shops in 1941), running just one round-trip a day to fulfill franchise obligations. Even this fragment of interurban service did not last long. On September 8, 1941, one of the two high-speed cars still in use met the one remaining work car in a head-on collision at speed. The high-speed car had stalled, and the work car was sent from Indianapolis to investigate. But the first car had recovered and proceeded, leading to a head-on collision and injured passengers and crew. The operator of the high-speed car eventually died, as did one of the passengers. The Indianapolis to Seymour service immediately stopped, and soon the track was removed. This was the end of the Indiana Railroad.Bradley, p281: stalled passenger car and car sent to help collide. It was an ignominious end to a great interurban system created ten years earlier to use and make profitable the former widespread network of 1920s Indiana interurbans. Kingsland wreck In the early years on the Union Traction a tragic wreck occurred at Kingsland, Indiana, between two wood cars. An excerpt from a local newspaper said: \\"FORT WAYNE, Ind., Sept. 22. -- The authorities of Wells county and officials of the traction company today are making a rigid investigation to attach responsibility for the collision of two traction cars on the Bluffton line of the Fort Wayne & Wabash Valley Traction company yesterday, in which forty persons were killed and eight injured. Today Frank I. HARDY, superintendent of transportation of the traction company, stated that disregard of orders caused the wreck and that B. T. CORKWELL, motorman of the southbound train, probably is the one to blame. The disaster, rated as the worst in all interurban history, occurred at a sharp curve, near Kingsland, six miles from Bluffton. The line is operated under a block system and until the railway makes public the orders issued the crews, it will not be definitely known which motorman was negligent.\\" Surviving rolling stock *55, preserved operational at the Seashore Trolley Museum as Lehigh Valley Transit 1030 *65, preserved operational at the Illinois Railway Museum *167 \\"Scottsburg,\\" preserved at the West Coast Railway Association as Pacific Great Eastern \\"Clinton\\" *202, preserved at the Western Railway Museum as Portland Traction Company 4001 *205, preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum *375, preserved in Scottsburg, Indiana as Chicago South Shore and South Bend 503 *376, preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum as Chicago South Shore and South Bend 1100 *377, preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum as Chicago South Shore and South Bend 504 *429, preserved by the Hoosier Heartland Trolley Company as Union Traction 429 *437, preserved by the Hoosier Heartland Trolley Company as Union Traction 437 *715, preserved by a private owner in Ohio *several older interurban cars retired in the first years of IR have also been preserved. *128 inside house at 192 S. 7th St. Austin In.

(formerly Clear Channel Communications until September 2014). Its studios are located in the Stone Oak neighborhood in Far North San Antonio, and the transmitter site is in Frederich Wilderness Park on the city's northwest side. Station History On May 5, 1964, KMFM signed on 96.1 MHz. It was a classical music station owned by the Pennington family, broadcasting from studios at 134 E. Agarita Ave. In 1976, Harry Pennington, Jr. died, and his wife Rosa Lee took over the station before selling it to Classic Media in 1977. Classic built a new, 100 kW facility for the station. Six years later, the station was sold to C&W; Wireless, which programmed a Contemporary Christian format known as \\"Son Light Radio FM 96\\" and changed the callsign to KSLR to match the new moniker. Inner City Broadcasting, which already owned KSJL 760 AM, bought KSLR in 1986. The two stations began simulcasting as Super Q 96 FM and Super Q 76 AM, with the callsign changed to KSAQ on the FM side. In 1988, the simulcast was split, with 96.1 FM becoming known by the short name Q96 FM. During this time, a long segment of news known as \\"Cruz News\\" aired weekday mornings at 7 on Q96. On March 17, 1991, the format was changed to rock under the 96 Rock name. It was the only FM rock station in San Antonio for a year, until Oldies 99.5 KISS reverted to its rock format in 1992. In 1993, Inner City sold 760 AM to Clear Channel Communications and moved its format of Urban Adult Contemporary music to 96.1 FM, with the station changing its calls to KSJL-FM. Unlike KSJL at 760 AM, the new KSJL-FM did not use \\"The Touch\\" format from Satellite Music Networks, and it added more mainstream Urban Contemporary tracks as well as \\"The Mix Show\\" with Ricco and D-Street, which would air Monday-Saturdays from 7-10p.m. In 1998, another series of shuffles occurred when Inner City sold KSJL-FM to Clear Channel for $10 million. The Mix show was dropped on July 4 of that year, and the station reverted to a more adult-based Urban Contemporary format. The format was simulcast on a leased station, 810 AM KCHG, which would soon change its calls to KSJL itself. In addition, KTXX-FM, a rimshot located in Devine, Texas, increased its power to reach San Antonio proper, becoming the new FM home of KSJL. All this movement made way for a new format on 96.1. At 5p.m. on September 3, 1998, Mix 96.1 debuted, and shortly after the callsign changed to KXXM. The first song aired was \\"The Way\\" by Fastball. KXXM would play artists like Will Smith, Jewel, Nsync, Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and other Adult Top 40 artists.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-09-11.pdf On June 30, 2017 at 5p.m., after playing \\"Be the One\\" by Dua Lipa, the station rebranded as \\"96.1 NOW\\", launching commercial free through the July 4th weekend.

Boarding from the park's Critter Country section, up to twenty visitors paddle a canoe around the Rivers of America, accompanied by two guides. This is the only Disneyland attraction that is powered by park visitors. The attraction originally opened as Indian War Canoes on July 4, 1956 as part of Frontierland‚Äôs Indian Village expansion. It also operates under the name of Beaver Brother's Explorer Canoes at Tokyo Disneyland and operated at the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World and at Disneyland Park in Disneyland Paris. At Shanghai Disneyland Park, the ride is simply named Explorer Canoes. Ride Description  Canoe cruising around the Rivers of America At the original Disneyland version of the attraction, riders embark and disembark from a small boat dock next to the Hungry Bear restaurant in the Critter Country section of the park. Each fiberglass canoe holds twenty guests, two per row. Each canoe has two guides dressed as frontiersmen (or frontierswomen) at the bow and stern. These guides are referred to as the helmsman, bowman, and sternman. Riders/rowers are given a short lesson on how to paddle the canoe to power the boat properly after leaving the dock. Small children are required to wear life jackets. Life jackets are also available for adults who cannot swim in the event the boat ever capsizes. As the canoe travels around Tom Sawyer Island, located in the center of the man-made river, the guides point out the sights along the way, such as a settler's cabin and the Indian chief on horseback. The ride's length depends upon how fast the paddlers are and how much other traffic is on the river. Lacking tracks or a predetermined path to follow, they typically travel much faster than the large boats, like the Mark Twain Riverboat and the Sailing Ship Columbia which ride along submerged tracks and return by the last bend of Splash Mountain. The attraction operates year-round on weekends and includes weekdays during the park's peak seasons. The canoes generally close at dusk as to prepare the Rivers of America for any night water shows such as Fantasmic!. History It is one of only two attractions in Disneyland to be in three different lands without ever being moved. Originally called Indian War Canoes, the attraction opened on July 4, 1956, as part of Frontierland's Indian Village expansion, with real American Indian guides aboard every canoe. Guests used a \\"D ticket\\" to ride the attraction. The Indian War Canoes closed with Indian Village in 1971 but reopened on May 19 as Davy Crockett‚Äôs Explorer Canoes, inspired by the Davy Crockett miniseries, with the guides now wearing coonskin caps. It became a part of Bear Country, home of Country Bear Jamboree, when that section of the park opened in 1972. The area was later renamed Critter Country in 1989, which now takes in Splash Mountain and The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh attractions. The canoes closed suddenly on October 3, 1998, igniting rumors that they were closed permanently. However, the attraction reopened the following June. Davy Crockett's Explorer Canoes operates on busier days only, primarily in the summer and on weekends. In addition to the Explorer Canoes, Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom's Liberty Square operated the Mike Fink Keel Boats until 1997. This attraction was based on the miniseries episode \\"Davy Crockett's Keelboat Race\\". On January 11, 2016, the Davy Crockett Explorer Canoes, along with the other attractions and shows along the Rivers of America, temporarily closed for the construction of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. The attraction reopened on July 29, 2017. Other parks Walt Disney World Davy Crockett Explorer Canoes debuted in Frontierland on opening day at Walt Disney World. A C ticket was required for guests to board the long canoes from a dock located to the north of the Tom Sawyer Island raft launch and travel along the same path as other watercraft on the Rivers of America. The attraction closed in 1994. Tokyo Disneyland A canoe attraction opened in Tokyo Disneyland under the name of Davey Crockett Explorer Canoes along the Rivers of America in the theme park's Westernland. It was renamed Beaver Brothers Explorer Canoes in 1992 with the opening of Critter Country. Disneyland Paris An Indian Canoes canoe ride opened with Euro Disneyland on April 12, 1992. It also closed in 1994. Shanghai Disneyland This attraction is known as Bilge Rat Bill's Explorer Canoes. Departing from Dead Man's Landing, the canoes travel through Treasure Cove's lagoon and Adventure Isle's Q'olari River.

Overview Based on the Vera club in Groningen, Netherlands. The name Vera comes from the phrase Veri Et Recti Amici, which is Latin meaning \\"true and sincere friends\\". Seattle's VERA Project was founded in 2001 by James Keblas, Shannon Stewart (both studied at the University of Groningen in 1999), and Kate Becker (founder of the Old Redmond Firehouse), along with the help of many other community organizers and the City of Seattle. A good description of the project is a quote from its own website: :Vera is an all-ages volunteer fueled music and arts venue. By engaging participants at all levels of music production and community organizing, Vera strives to fulfill its mission to foster a participatory creative culture through popular music concerts, arts programs, experiential learning and volunteer opportunities for all ages, especially young people. Vera‚Äôs programs are always all ages, with a focus on young people ages 14 to 24. Most Vera programs are at the Seattle Center venue, and include: : :* Popular music concerts :* Audio engineering training :* Youth-driven governance :* Visual art exhibits :* Live and studio recording :* Leadership training :* Silkscreen printing/classes :* Event production training :* Internships :* :These activities are initiated and driven collaboratively by Vera‚Äôs volunteers, staff, Board of Directors and youth-led Membership. Events The Vera Project's first event was hosted on January 27, 2001 at the IBEW Local 46 and featured local artists The Murder City Devils, Botch and The Blood Brothers. Almost 1,000 people attended including local press and city officials. The Vera Project went on to host several more shows at IBEW Local 46 and then moved on to the Theatre Off Jackson when their lease expired at the IBEW Local 46. The Vera Project hosted shows at the Theatre Off Jackson until they found a longer-lasting home at 1916 4th Ave in 2002 that would be demolished a few years later for new development. The Vera Project hosted shows at various venues in Seattle until their current location, the corner of Warren Ave N. and Republican at the Seattle Center, was finished in 2007. The new Vera is open for business and hosting about two shows a week, along with a variety of other arts and media-related programming. The Vera Project has hosted many successful local and national music acts including Band of Horses, Chairlift, Dan Deacon, The Evens, Fruit Bats, Harvey Danger, Lightning Bolt, Minus the Bear, Murs, No Age, Shellac, The Shins, TV on the Radio, Weezer, WHY?, Quasi, Health, Surfer Blood, The Gossip, Fleet Foxes, Macklemore, Car Seat Headrest, and Titus Andronicus.

It is a medium-sized tree native to dry regions in Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Vietnam. In the Philippines, it is commonly known as \\"bogta-e\\",\\"bogtalay\\", and \\"Kalyos\\". In Cambodia, it is known as Snay. Several rural communes in Cambodia were named after the tree such as Snay Pol village (Poisonous Snay) of Prey Veng and Krang Snay (Hill of Snay) of Kampot Province. In Malaysia, it is known as \\"kesinai\\". Structure The leaves are approximately 50-100 mm (2-4\\") long, rigid, oval-shaped, irregularly toothed, and borne on small petioles. Staminate flower heads are spherical with minute flowers; pistillate flowers have longer peduncles. Uses Papermaking The tree has a number of uses. It has been important in papermaking in Thailand for seven hundred years. Virtually all of the ancient Thai documents still in existence are written on the bark of this tree. The Buddhist texts and official records from before the twentieth century in Thailand are known as khoi books. The paper is durable even in the local high-humidity climate. It does not burn easily and it is resistant to yellowing and insect damage. Today other fiber sources are used to make paper and khoi fibers are used primarily by artisans who produce paper using traditional techniques. In Vietnam traditional woodworking uses the coarse texture of the leaves as natural sandpaper. Health Various parts of the plant are used in Ayurveda and other folk medicines for the treatment of different ailments such as filariasis, leprosy, toothache, diarrhoea, and cancer. It is a well known and documented ethnomedicinal plant. Research carried out using different in vitro and in vivo techniques of biological evaluation support most of these claims. It has been used in the past as an oral hygiene product and for this reason it is also known as the toothbrush tree. A twig or stick about eight inches long with a frayed or mashed end to increase the cleaning surface was used as a tooth cleaning aid up until the middle of the twentieth century when the cheap and more practical plastic brush with a toothpaste become common throughout the world. It is the main active ingredient of a popular brand of a herbal, dark brown toothpaste in Thailand. Different studies were carried on its antibacterial activity upon various microorganisms involving oral and nasopharyngeal infections and especially Streptococcus mutans. An extract of Strebulus asper leaves have demonstrated to possess a selective bactericidal activity towards Streptococcus, especially to S. mutans which has been shown to be strongly linked with dental caries. The Khoi wood is used throughout South-East Asia as an ingredient mixed with cannabis which reduces the throat irritation associated with inhaling cannabis smoke through a water pipe or bong.

Both the -means and -medoids algorithms are partitional (breaking the dataset up into groups) and both attempt to minimize the distance between points labeled to be in a cluster and a point designated as the center of that cluster. In contrast to the -means algorithm, -medoids chooses data points as centers (medoids or exemplars) and can be used with arbitrary distances, while in -means the centre of a cluster is not necessarily one of the input data points (it is the average between the points in the cluster). The PAM method was proposed in 1987Kaufman, L. and Rousseeuw, P.J. (1987), Clustering by means of Medoids, in Statistical Data Analysis Based on the L_1‚ÄìNorm and Related Methods, edited by Y. Dodge, North- Holland, 405‚Äì416. for the work with l_1 norm and other distances. -medoid is a classical partitioning technique of clustering, which clusters the data set of objects into clusters, with the number of clusters assumed known a priori (which implies that the programmer must specify k before the execution of the algorithm). The \\"goodness\\" of the given value of can be assessed with methods such as the silhouette method. It is more robust to noise and outliers as compared to -means because it minimizes a sum of pairwise dissimilarities instead of a sum of squared Euclidean distances. A medoid can be defined as the object of a cluster whose average dissimilarity to all the objects in the cluster is minimal, that is, it is a most centrally located point in the cluster. Algorithms PAM choosing initial medoids, then iterating to convergence for k=3 clusters, visualized with ELKI. The most common realisation of -medoid clustering is the partitioning around medoids (PAM) algorithm. PAM uses a greedy search which may not find the optimum solution, but it is faster than exhaustive search. It works as follows: # Initialize: greedily select of the data points as the medoids to minimize the cost # Associate each data point to the closest medoid. # While the cost of the configuration decreases: ## For each medoid , and for each non-medoid data point : ### Consider the swap of and , and compute the cost change ### If the cost change is the current best, remember this m and o combination ##Perform the best swap of m_{\\\\text{best}} and o_{\\\\text{best}}, if it decreases the cost function. Otherwise, the algorithm terminates. The runtime complexity of the original PAM algorithm per iteration of (3) is O(k (n-k)^2), by only computing the change in cost. A naive implementation recomputing the entire cost function every time will be in O(n^2k^2). This runtime can be further reduced to O(n^2), by splitting the cost change into three parts such that computations can be shared or avoided. Algorithms other than PAM have also been suggested in the literature, including the following Voronoi iteration method:T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani, and J. Friedman. The Elements of Statistical Learning, Springer (2001), 468‚Äì469. # Select initial medoids randomly # Iterate while the cost decreases: ## In each cluster, make the point that minimizes the sum of distances within the cluster the medoid ## Reassign each point to the cluster defined by the closest medoid determined in the previous step. However, k-means-style Voronoi iteration finds worse results, as it does not allow reassigning points to other clusters while changing means, and thus only explores a smaller search space. The approximate algorithms CLARA and CLARANS trade optimality for runtime. CLARA applies PAM on multiple subsamples, keeping the best result. CLARANS works on the entire data set, but only explores a subset of the possible swaps of medoids and non-medoids using sampling. Software * ELKI includes several k-medoid variants, including a Voronoi-iteration k-medoids, the original PAM algorithm, Reynolds' improvements, and the O(n¬≤) FastPAM algorithm, CLARA, CLARANS, FastCLARA and FastCLARANS. * Julia contains a k-medoid implementation of the k-means style algorithm (faster, but much worse result quality) in the JuliaStats/Clustering.jl package. * KNIME includes a k-medoid implementation supporting a variety of efficient matrix distance measures, as well as a number of native (and integrated third-party) k-means implementations * R contains PAM in the \\"cluster\\" package, including some of the FastPAM improvements via the pamonce=5 option. * RapidMiner has an operator named KMedoids, but it does not implement the KMedoids algorithm correctly. Instead, it is a k-means variant, that substitutes the mean with the closest data point (which is not the medoid). * MATLAB implements PAM, CLARA, and two other algorithms to solve the k-medoid clustering problem.

After being discharged at age 21, he opened a karate school / gym and took weekend security jobs at local nightclubs. This developed into a career as he worked as a bouncer, DJ and sometimes manager at various night clubs and strip clubs, including Pacers Strip Club in San Diego, Crazy Horse Saloon and the Palomino Club. In 1991, he took a job at the just-opened \\"Cheetah's\\" strip club, where he worked until 2003, and was one of the witnesses in a major FBI sting against club owner Michael Galardi and several members of the Las Vegas and San Diego city councils. In 2004, he wrote a book about his observations of the case and the general flow of life in a strip club. As of 2006, the book is in its fourth printing, and Jordan is frequently cited in the media in stories about the adult entertainment industry. Jordan is also trained in Muay Thai kick boxing, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and NHB fighting. He occasionally competed, with his most notable match being a close loss against Chuck Liddell, who was later named as UFC Light Heavyweight champion.

Plot Boston law student and part-time mechanic Charlie Farrow (Patrick Dempsey) was asked by his boss to deliver a new Porsche from Boston to Atlantic City for a client. When he gets close to Atlantic City, the Porsche breaks down. While Charlie waits for the car to be repaired, a cab driver (who mistakes Charlie for being an Atlantic City high roller) takes him to an undercover casino that has a bar room and kitchen, so Charlie can get something to eat. At the casino, Charlie earns the wrath of Denny Halloran (Alan C. Peterson), who takes exception to Charlie beating him at poker. In the resulting fight, Denny trips over a potted palm, accidentally hits his head on the sharp corner of a counter, and dies. Charlie is now on the spot, because Denny happens to be the son of a mob boss named Matt Halloran (Ken Pogue), who is the owner and despot of the casino and most of the police force, including Chief Travers and Lt. Martins who think Charlie could be innocent. Wrongfully accused of murdering Denny, Charlie finds himself on the run from both dirty cops and Matt's henchmen, all of whom want to collect the $50,000 bounty that Matt placed on Charlie. With only one ally, reluctant witness Karen Landers (Kelly Preston) who knows the truth and agrees to aid Charlie, Charlie finds himself in a deadly game of cat and mouse. The bodies pile up as Charlie dodges flying bullets and bowling pins, explosions from numerous assault weapons and miscellaneous shrapnel and twisted auto parts as he is pursued on a nightmare race through racetracks, amusement parks, bowling alleys and shopping malls by Matt's men, corrupt cops and Travers and Martins. After Karen is wounded and two dirty cops die chasing him Charlie surrenders himself to Travers and Martins but they are pursued by two of Matt's men, Sammy and Marv, and run off the road, Travers is killed and Martins is injured. Sammy and Marv take Charlie to Matt who tells them to kill Charlie, however, he kills Marv then Sammy by causing them to fall off of a roof. After killing Matt's other henchmen, Charlie and Matt confront each other at Matt's dog-race track. Matt dies as he is impaled by a mechanical pacer rabbit that was speeding toward him. Martins arrives after this and tells Charlie that \\"they sure fooled with the wrong guy\\", before placing a reassuring hand on Charlie's shoulder.

Early life Vinson was born in Beaumont, Texas, the daughter of oil man Edward Rulfs.. She was a tall and distinguished-looking woman with brown eyes and naturally curly hair. Her personal life included a passion for horses she developed during her youth. She studied at the University of Texas at Austin. Theater In Austin, she met Mrs. March Culmore, director of the Houston, Texas Little Theater. Culmore took Helen as a pupil and soon the young woman was playing leads with The Little Theater Group. From Texas, she moved quickly to Broadway, where her credits included Los Angeles (1927), Death Takes a Holiday (1931), Berlin (1931), and The Fatal Alibi (1932). A succession of performances followed and led to a contract with Warner Bros. Later, she regretted her quick leap to Hollywood and motion pictures. She lamented, \\"If I'd stayed in New York longer, I'd be getting a much bigger salary out here now.\\" Film career in The Little Giant (1933) Vinson's screen career often featured her in roles in which she played the part of the other woman or (pre- Code) loose women with active romantic lives. Her first film role was Jewel Robbery (1932), which starred William Powell and Kay Francis. She appeared as Doris Delafield in The Kennel Murder Case, which starred Powell as Philo Vance. One of her memorable roles was in The Wedding Night (1935), when she played the wife of Gary Cooper's character and the rival of Anna Sten's, in a story about the Connecticut tobacco fields. Another performance was in the RKO film In Name Only (1939), in which she was cast as the treacherous friend of Carole Lombard, Kay Francis and Cary Grant's characters. Another standout role for Vinson was as an undercover federal agent posing as a femme fatale opposite Richard Cromwell in Universal Pictures's anti-Nazi action drama entitled, Enemy Agent (1940). She followed that role with that of Helen Draque in The Thin Man Goes Home. Vinson's film career ended in 1945. For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Vinson has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1560 Vine Street. Private life and death Vinson married Harry Nelson Vickerman, a carpet manufacturer, in Houston, Texas, in May 1925. They divorced on February 7, 1934. In 1935, she married Fred Perry, a British tennis champion. They lived in England before moving to Hollywood. They divorced in 1938, after which she married Donald Hardenbrook, a \\"wealthy New York socialite\\". Away from film-making and following her retirement, Vinson made frequent trips to New York City to see Broadway shows, visited friends in her home state of Texas, and enjoyed the Mardi Gras in New Orleans. She loved horses and had a private and personal mount named Arrabella. Helen Vinson died in Chapel Hill, North Carolina in 1999, aged 92.

It is a fried type of doughnut, made of small balls of yeast dough and coated with granulated sugar and sometimes cinnamon. The traditional Portuguese malasadas don't contain holes or any type of filling, but some variations do, especially the ones made in Hawaii. Malasadas are often eaten on Mardi Gras - the day before Ash Wednesday. In Madeira and in the Azores, malasadas are mainly eaten on Ter√ßa-feira Gorda (‚ÄúFat Tuesday‚Äù in English; Mardi Gras in French) which is also the day before Lent begins. It's a traditional confection eaten in the Azores islands and in Madeira during the Portuguese Carnival (Carnival of Madeira in the Madeira Islands). Malasadas were created with the intention of using all the lard and sugar in one's home, in preparation for Lent (similar to the tradition of the Shrove Tuesday in the United Kingdom, commonly incorrectly called Pancake Day). This tradition was taken to Hawaii, where they celebrate Shrove Tuesday, known as Malasada Day, which dates back to the days of the sugarcane plantations of the 19th century when the Portuguese (mostly from Madeira and the Azores) went to Hawaii to work in those plantations, bringing their Catholic traditions. These workers used up butter and sugar prior to Lent by making large batches of malasadas. By region United States In 1878, Portuguese laborers from Madeira and the Azores went to Hawaii to work in the plantations. These immigrants brought their traditional foods with them, including a fried dough pastry called \\"malasada.\\" Today, there are numerous bakeries in the Hawaiian islands specializing in malasadas. On the East Coast, in Rhode Island, and Southeastern Massachusetts, there is also a high population of Portuguese- Americans. Festivals in towns such as New Bedford and Fall River will often serve Portuguese cuisine, including Malasadas. Mardi Gras (\\"Fat Tuesday\\"), the day before Lent, is Malasada Day in Hawaii. Being predominantly Catholic, Portuguese immigrants would need to use up all their butter and sugar prior to Lent. They did so by making large batches of malasadas, which they would subsequently share with friends from all the other ethnic groups in the plantation camps. In the United States, malasadas are cooked in many Portuguese or Portuguese descendant homes on Fat Tuesday. It is a tradition where the older children take the warm doughnuts and roll them in sugar while the eldest woman ‚Äî mother or grandmother ‚Äî cooks them.

From the mid 1980s to 2017, it had administration of all military affairs within Beijing city, Tianjin city, Hebei province, Shanxi province, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The Region is mainly responsible for defending the People's Republic of China from Mongolia and Russia, and also protects the capital of China, and had the largest number of military personnel of any of the seven regions active from 1985-2017. The Region has now been disbanded and superseded by the Central Theater Command. Both the 63rd and 65th Corps/Group Armies were stationed in the Beijing area after returning from the Korean War and remained in the region ever since, becoming Group Armies after 1985.Michael Swaine, RAND 1992, 75. The 13th Air Force Corps was stationed at Shijiazhuang in Hebei Province from 1971 to 1976. On 26 October 1988 the 17th Air Division was reorganized into the Beijing MR Training Base (serials 6xx2x). In reductions announced in September 2003, the 24th Group Army (Hebei), and the 63rd Group Army (Shanxi) were both disbanded. About the same time, the 10th Air Corps, also stationed in the region, was disestablished (PLAAF 2010). The International Institute for Strategic Studies attributed to the command 300,000 personnel in 2006, consisting of three group armies (the 27th Army, 38th Army, and the 65th Army), two armoured divisions, one mechanised infantry division, five motorised divisions, one artillery division, three armoured, seven motorised infantry, four artillery, a total of five various anti-aircraft brigades, and one anti-tank regiment.International Institute for Strategic Studies, The Military Balance 2006 The command is also augmented by the Beijing Garrison, which consists of the 1st and 3rd Beijing Garrison Divisions (Military Police), and the Beijing Garrison Honor Guard Battalion and Color Guard Company, both of which are charged with public duties. The command is also home to the PLA Navy (PLAN) North Sea Fleet. The last commander was General Song Puxuan (2014-2016). The political commissar was General Liu Fulian.  History and mission  A memorial at the entrance to a military unit in Beijing's Fengtai District The Beijing Military Region traces its lineage to the establishment of the Northwest Military Region in May 1948. It was renamed the Beijing Military Region in 1955, when the Inner Mongolia Military Region was downgraded to a district, and was folded into the Beijing Military Region. The Beijing Military Region is primarily charged with protecting the capital. Because of its location in the capital, the Beijing Military Region was the most important of the seven military regions. Each unit from the Beijing Military Region contributed forces to Beijing for the crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, and these elements remained deployed in Beijing long after using deadly force to remove the demonstrators.GlobalSecurity.org - Beijing Military Region, Beijing Military Area Command In addition to guarding the capital, the Beijing Military Region is also in charge of training key personnel for leadership positions through the numerous military academies in the region.

Earth missionary Althea Merrick, stranded on the planet Krishna and fleeing from an unwanted marriage to a Viagens Interplanetarias official, joins a scientist and poet en route to a utopian Terran colony on the island of Zesh. There she becomes embroiled in the affairs of some peculiarly intelligent aborigines. The story satirizes contemporary pseudoscientific movements and has some parallels to Daniel Keyes's novel Flowers for Algernon, which it predates. The Wheels of If Originally published in Unknown, October 1940. Lawyer Alister Park is inexplicably torn from his normal existence and thrust into a series of alternate worlds. Each morning he discovers he has become someone else, in a world changed from his own. Ultimately he finds himself a bishop in Vinland, an America that might have been had the early Anglo-Saxons converted to Celtic Christianity and the Franks lost the Battle of Tours. The displacement of his consciousness turns out to have been incidental to a plot directed against his other self, Bishop Scoglund, whose campaign to extend civil rights to Vinland's native inhabitants, the Skraelings, has aroused opposition. To get home Park must continue his counterpart's struggle while somehow unraveling the mystery of how to reunite the minds of all his selves with their proper realities.

It is a potential space in the cheek, and is paired on each side. The buccal space is superficial to the buccinator muscle and deep to the platysma muscle and the skin. The buccal space is part of the subcutaneous space, which is continuous from head to toe. Structure Boundaries The boundaries of each buccal space are: * the angle of the mouth anteriorly, * the masseter muscle posteriorly, * the zygomatic process of the maxilla and the zygomaticus muscles superiorly, * the depressor anguli oris muscle and the attachment of the deep fascia to the mandible inferiorly, * the buccinator muscle medially (the buccal space is superficial to the buccinator), * the platysma muscle, subcutaneous tissue and skin laterally (the space is deep to platysma), Communications * to the pterygomandibular space, infratemporal space, submasseteric space or even to the lateral pharyngeal space posteriorly, * to the infraorbital (canine) space superiorly, Function Contents In health, the space contains: * the buccal fat pad, * the parotid duct (Stenson's duct), * the anterior facial artery and vein, * the transverse facial artery and vein, Clinical significance Diagram showing the origin of the upper part of the buccinator muscle to the maxilla (the middle part originates from the pterygomandibular raphe, where buccinator joins the superior constrictor muscle). Diagram showing the origin of the lower part of the buccinator muscle on the lateral surface of the mandible. A hematoma may create the buccal space, e.g. due to hemorrhage following wisdom teeth surgery. Buccal space abscesses typically cause a facial swelling over the cheek that may extend from the zygomatic arch above to the inferior border of the mandible below, and from the anterior border the masseter muscle posteriorly to the angle of the mouth anteriorly. Unless another space is also involved, the tissues around the eye are not swollen. It is usually treated by surgical incision and drainage, and the incision is located inside the mouth to avoid a scar on the face. The incision are placed below the parotid papilla to avoid damage to the duct, and forceps are used to divide buccinator and insert a surgical drain into the buccal space. The drain is kept in place for a variable period of time following the procedure. Long standing buccal abscesses tend to spontaneously drain via a cutaneous sinus at the inferior of the space, near the inferior border of the mandible and the angle of the mouth. An untreated cutaneous sinus can cause disfiguring soft tissue fibrosis, and the tract can become epithelial lined. Odontogenic infections An abscess originating from a tooth which has spread to involve the buccal space. Above, deformation of the cheek on the second day. Below, deformation on the third day. Sometimes the buccal space is reported to be the most commonly involved fascial space by dental abscesses, although other sources report it is the submandibular space. Infections originating in either maxillary or mandibular teeth can spread into the buccal space, usually maxillary molars (most commonly) and premolars or mandibular premolars. Odontogenic infections which erode through the buccal cortical plate of the mandible or maxilla will either spread into the buccal vestibule (sulcus) and drain intra-orally, or into the buccal space, depending upon the level of the perforation in relation to the attachment of buccinator to the maxilla above and the mandible below (see diagrams). Frequently infection spreads in both directions as the buccinator is only a partial barrier. Infections associated with mandibular teeth with apices at a level inferior to the attachment, and maxillary teeth with apices at a level superior to the attachment are more likely to drain into the buccal space.

These, King Henry had previously confiscated in 1155 when William Peverel fell into disfavour. With the failure of the revolt, de Ferrers was taken prisoner by King Henry, at Northampton on the 31 July 1174, along with the King of Scots and the earls of Chester and Lincoln, along with a number of his Derbyshire underlings and was held at Caen.

Once a lagoon at the mouth of the Hokitika River, it became a lake when the river shifted its course. Lake MƒÅhinapua was the site of a significant battle between NgƒÅi Tahu and NgƒÅti Wairangi MƒÅori, and is regarded by them as a sacred site where swimming and fishing are prohibited. In European times it was part of an inland waterway that carried timber and settlers between Hokitika and Ross until the building of the railway. Today it is protected as a scenic reserve for boating, camping, and hiking.  Name  The name comes from the MƒÅori , a proper name, and , flower: MƒÅhina's flower. There is not yet an agreed official spelling of the name in New Zealand English and it is commonly written without the macron, or with a macron on the second \\"a\\" (MahinƒÅpua). T≈´wharewhare / MahinƒÅpua Creek's official name, confusingly, is currently spelled with a macron over the second \\"a\\".  Geography  The lake is beside at the small town of Ruatapu, between Hokitika and Ross. The road to the lake turns off the highway south of Hokitika and passes through a tunnel of native forest to the lake shore. The Mahinapua Walkway (the Mananui Tramline Track) can be reached from the western side of the lake south of Hokitika or from its eastern terminus south on Woodstock- Rimu Road; the walkway reaches Lake Mahinapua at Picnic Bay. During the retreat of glaciers at the end of the Last Glacial Period 12,000 years ago, a series of glacial moraines was deposited along what is now the eastern (landward) side of the lake. What we now call the Hokitika River flowed to the sea between those moraines, where Lake Mahinapua is now. As the sea gradually rose and encroached on the land, it pushed a line of dunes before it, which created a shallow coastal lagoon roughly from the Tasman Sea coast. The Hokitika River then changed course, shifting to its current mouth 8 km north and leaving behind a lake now fed by a series of small creeks.  Flora and fauna  The forest around Lake Mahinapua ranges from rimu-kamahi on the terraces and moraines left by the retreating glacier, to coastal dune forest that starts on ancient dunes (around the Jum Michel walk), through to low forest on more recent dunes (as seen at Mananui Bush). In the northern and southern wetlands bordering the lake grows kahikatea swamp forest and flax. Flax grows profusely along MahinƒÅpua Creek, where it was cultivated for commercial harvest after the forest was cleared. This is one of the few areas on this art of the West Coast that preserves an almost continuous forest from the Southern Alps to the Tasman Sea. Both southern rƒÅtƒÅ and northern rƒÅtƒÅ are present at Lake Mahinapua; it is the southern limit for the latter species. The lake is home to waterbirds such as black swans and mallard ducks. Royal spoonbills, grey ducks, and fernbirds can occasionally be seen; white herons (k≈çtuku) can be found seasonally around the shore or more commonly in the streams entering or leaving the lake. The southern crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus australis) and sometimes bitterns are rarely seen here. The surrounding bush contains bellbirds, t≈´ƒ´, kerer≈´, and parakeets, as well as both long-tailed and shining cuckoos and brown creepers. There are still small populations of shortfin eels and ƒ´nanga in Mahinapua, which coexist with introduced perch, tench, and brown bullhead catfish. Luckily rudd have not colonised the lake, but it contains invasive white waterlily (Nymphaea alba) and Cape pondweed (Aponogeton distachyos).  Human history  Lake Mahinapua was important to MƒÅori of the PƒÅtea and NgƒÅti Wairangi tribes as a mahinga kai (food gathering place) and a source of kuta or bamboo spike sedge (Eleocharis sphacelata), important for weaving. Later, with the introduction of pounamu stone to tribes outside the area, raiding parties and battles became a regular occurrence. Lake Mahinapua was the site of a significant battle between NgƒÅi Tahu and NgƒÅti Wairangi in the late 17th century in which NgƒÅi Tahu mokihi (rafts) were overturned and many drowned. The piled-up bodies of chiefs on the lake's foreshore gave the battle its name: (heap of sharks). That name is also used for the lake in general. The site of the battle is regarded as a wƒÅhi tapu (sacred place) and local NgƒÅi Tahu will not harvest food from the lake or swim in it. Control of the lakebed was vested in Poutini NgƒÅi Tahu as part of the 1998 NgƒÅi Tahu Claims Settlement. When the tide is high, it is possible to travel by small boat from the lake down MahinƒÅpua Creek to Hokitika, a fact of great importance to PƒÅkehƒÅ settlement before the building of a road. From 1865 boats were used to carry people and freight from Hokitika up the creek, crossing the lake and unloading at a portage landing beside Ruatapu, and continuing down a lagoon to Ross. In 1867 two small paddle steamers were built in Hokitika for this purpose, using equipment salved from shipwrecks. The remains of a later paddle steamer are on display at Shanghai Bay. From the 1880s to the 1960s timber (largely kahikatea) was milled in the coastal forest and after the timber was cleared flax was harvested along MƒÅhinapua Creek. Both were transported back to Hokitika by barges or paddleboats until the opening of the Ross Branch railway. The railway opened to Ruatapu on 9 November 1906, was extended to Ross on 1 April 1909; it closed on 24 November 1980, but the historic Mahinapua Creek Railway Bridge has been preserved. Mining and gold dredging also occurred in the area. At the census of 1901, the population of Lake Mahinapua was eleven. In 1893 nearly 100 hectares along the creek and lakeshore were gazetted as a reserve overseen by the Westland Acclimatisation Society. In 1907, the Lake Mahinapua Scenic Reserve was established to protect the land around the lake, and there are short walking tracks run through the bush ‚Äì the Jum Michel Walk and Swimmers Beach Walk ‚Äì as well as a 2 to 2¬Ω hour walk that follows the route of a logging tramline to site of the Mananui Sawmill. In December 2012 the West Coast Treetop Walk opened on the edge of the Scenic Reserve, off Woodstock-Rimu Road. Shanghai Bay on the southwestern shore was made a recreation reserve in 1974. A campground and the Lake Mahinapua Aquatic Club is based there, and sailing, kayaking and kayaking is popular ‚Äì it is possible to kayak 9 km through forest and swampland to Hokitika, or up Mirror Creek at the opposite end of the lake. Despite the lake's wƒÅhi tapu status, swimming, fishing and duck shooting is common.

In poetry, the early 18th century was an age of satire and public verse, and in prose, it was an age of the developing novel. In drama, by contrast, it was an age in transition between the highly witty and sexually playful Restoration comedy, the pathetic she-tragedy of the turn of the 18th century, and any later plots of middle- class anxiety. The Augustan stage retreated from the Restoration's focus on cuckoldry, marriage for fortune, and a life of leisure. Instead, Augustan drama reflected questions the mercantile class had about itself and what it meant to be gentry: what it meant to be a good merchant, how to achieve wealth with morality, and the proper role of those who serve. Augustan drama has a reputation as an era of decline. One reason for this is that there were few dominant figures of the Augustan stage. Instead of a single genius, a number of playwrights worked steadily to find subject matter that would appeal to a new audience. In addition to this, playhouses began to dispense with playwrights altogether or to hire playwrights to match assigned subjects, and this made the producer the master of the script. When the public did tire of anonymously authored, low-content plays and a new generation of wits made the stage political and aggressive again, the Whig ministry stepped in and began official censorship that put an end to daring and innovative content. This conspired with the public's taste for special effects to reduce theatrical output and promote the novel. The middle-class tragedy As for prose and poetry, there is no clear beginning to the \\"Augustan era\\" in drama, but the end is clearly marked. Augustan-era drama ended definitively in 1737 with the Licensing Act. Prior to 1737, the English stage was changing rapidly from Restoration comedy and Restoration drama and their noble subjects to the quickly developing melodrama. George Lillo and Richard Steele wrote the trend-setting plays of the early Augustan period. Lillo's plays consciously turned from heroes and kings toward shopkeepers and apprentices. They emphasized drama on a household scale rather than a national scale, and the hamartia and agon in his tragedies are the common flaws of yielding to temptation and the commission of Christian sin. The plots are resolved with Christian forgiveness and repentance. Steele's The Conscious Lovers (1722) hinges upon his young hero avoiding fighting a duel. These plays set up a new set of values for the stage. Instead of amusing or inspiring the audience, they sought to instruct the audience and ennoble it. Further, the plays were popular precisely because they seemed to reflect the audience's own lives and concerns. Joseph Addison also wrote a play entitled Cato in 1713, but it did not inspire followers. Cato concerned the Roman statesman who opposed Julius Caesar. The year of its premi√®re is important for understanding why the play is unique, for Queen Anne was seriously ill at the time, and both the Tory ministry of the day and the Whig opposition (already led by Robert Walpole) were concerned about the succession. Both groups were in contact with Anne's exiled brother James Francis Edward Stuart. Londoners sensed this anxiety, for Anne had no surviving children; all of the closest successors in the Stuart family were Roman Catholic. Therefore, the figure of Cato was a transparent symbol of Roman integrity. The Whigs saw in him a Whig refusal to accept an absolute monarch from the House of Stuart, while the Tories saw in him a resistance to rule by a triumphant general (John Churchill, the Duke of Marlborough, whose wife Sarah was rumored to control Anne). Further, Cato's claim that Caesar profited by illegal war echoed the Tory accusations against Marlborough. Both sides cheered the play, even though Addison was himself clearly Whig and had meant the play as something near propaganda. John Home's play Douglas (1756) would have a similar fate to Cato in the next generation after the Licensing Act. The problem of \\"Spectacle\\" John Rich takes control of Covent Garden Theatre in 1732. The first play he would stage was The Way of the World. As during the Restoration, economic reality drove the stage during the Augustan period. Under Charles II court patronage meant economic success, and therefore the Restoration stage featured plays that would suit the monarch and/or court. The drama that celebrated kings and told the history of Britain's monarchs was fit fare for the crown and courtiers. Charles II was a philanderer, and so Restoration comedy featured a highly sexualized set of plays. However, after the reign of William III and Mary II, the court and crown stopped taking a great interest in the playhouse. Theaters had to get their money from the audience of city dwellers, therefore, and consequently plays that reflected city anxieties and celebrated the lives of citizens were the ones to draw crowds. The aristocratic material from the Restoration continued to be mounted, and adaptations of Tudor plays were made and ran, but the new plays that were authored and staged were the domestic- and middle-class dramas. The other dramatic innovation was \\"spectacle\\": plays that had little or no text, but which emphasized novel special effects. Pantomime and tableau spectacle The public attended when they saw their lives represented on the stage, but also attended when there was a sight that would impress them. If costumes were lavish, the sets impressive or the actresses alluring, audiences would attend. The Restoration spectacular had seen the development of English opera and oratorio and a war between competing theaters to produce the most expensive and eye-popping plays. However, these blockbuster productions could mean financial ruin as much as security, and neither of the two main playhouses could continue the brinksmanship for long. After these battles between the playhouses, and these were multiple,Shesgreen 27 the theaters calculatingly sought the highest appeal with the lowest cost. If the cost of rehearsal time, in particular, could be shortened, the theater's investment would be reduced. Rehearsal time cost a playhouse its cast, its property masters, and its stages, and a long rehearsal meant fewer plays put on. Additionally, dramatists received the money from each third night of box office, and this could be dangerous to a house that needed every farthing to defray costs. Star dramatists could negotiate for more than one benefit night and might have terms for benefits on revival, while new, unknown, or dependent authors could be managed. The solution for the theatrical producers was to cut the costs of plays and actors while increasing the outright spectacle, and there were quite a few plays that were not literary at all that were staged more often than the literary plays. A print by William Hogarth entitled A Just View of the British Stage from 1724 depicting the managers of Drury Lane (Robert Wilks, Colley Cibber, and Barton Booth) rehearsing a play consisting of nothing but special effects, while they used the scripts for The Way of the World, inter al., for toilet paper. This battle of effects was a common subject of satire for the literary wits, including Pope. John Rich and Colley Cibber dueled over special theatrical effects. They put on plays that were actually just spectacles, where the text of the play was almost an afterthought. Dragons, whirlwinds, thunder, ocean waves, and even actual elephants were on stage. Battles, explosions, and horses were put on the boards (Cibber). Rich specialized in pantomime and was famous as the character \\"Lun\\" in harlequin presentations. The playwrights of these works were hired men, not dramatists, and so they did not receive the traditional third-night author's profits. A pantomime, after all, required very little in the way of a playwright and much more in the way of a director, and with John Rich and Colley Cibber both acting as star players and directors, such on-demand spectacles did not necessitate a poet. Further, spectacles could be written quickly to answer to the public's whims or the rival theater's triumphs, rarely risked offensive political statements, and did not require paying benefits to a playwright. In other words, they gave the managers more profit. The plays put on in this manner are not generally preserved or studied, but their near monopoly on the theaters, particularly in the 1720s, infuriated established literary authors. Alexander Pope was only one of the poets to attack \\"spectacle\\" (in the 1727 Dunciad A and, with more vigor, the Dunciad B). The criticism was so widespread that Colley Cibber himself made excuses for his part in the special-effects war, claiming that he had no choice but to comply with market pressures. The \\"chromatic tortures\\" and divas of opera If vacant, subliterary spectacles were not enough of a threat to dramatists, opera, which had crossed over to England in the Restoration, experienced an enormous surge in popularity with Italian grand opera in England in the 1710s and 1720s. In The Spectator, both in number 18 and the 3 April 1711 number, and many places elsewhere, Joseph Addison fretted that foreign opera would drive English drama from the stage altogether. These early fears followed the sudden rage for the Italian singers and operas that took over London in 1711 with the arrival of Handel. Inasmuch as opera combined singing with acting, it was a mixed genre, and its violation of neoclassical strictures had made it a controversial form from the start. Addison, damning opera's heterogeny, wrote, \\"Our Countrymen could not forbear laughing when they heard a Lover chanting out a Billet-doux, and even the Superscription of a Letter set to a Tune.\\"Addison, Joseph ; Steele, Richard. \\"The Spectator\\", 1853. 218 This type of opera not only took up theatrical rehearsal time and space, it also took away dramatic subject matter. Straight playwrights were at a loss. As John Gay lamented (see below), no one could use music in a play unless it was as an opera, and Englishmen were nearly forbidden from that. To add insult to injury, the casts and celebrated stars were foreigners and, as with Farinelli and Senesino (the latter of whom was paid two thousand pounds for a single season in 1721), castrati. Castrati were symbols, to the English, of the Roman Catholic Church. The satirists saw in opera the non plus ultra of invidiousness. High melodies would cover the singers' expressions of grief or joy, conflating all emotion and sense under a tune that might be entirely unrelated. Alexander Pope blasted this shattering of \\"decorum\\" and \\"sense\\" in Dunciad B and suggested that its real purpose was to awaken the Roman Catholic Church's power (\\"Wake the dull Church\\") while it put a stop to the political and satirical stage and made all Londoners fall into the sleep of un-Enlightenment: :::Joy to Chaos! let Division reign: :::Chromatic tortures soon shall drive them [the muses] hence, :::Break all their nerves, and fritter all their sense: :::One Trill shall harmonize joy, grief, and rage, :::Wake the dull Church, and lull the ranting Stage; :::To the same notes thy sons shall hum, or snore, :::And all thy yawning daughters cry, encore. (IV 55‚Äì60) An 1875 postcard from the Victoria and Albert Hall showing the Duke's Company theatre in Dorset Gardens (the so-called \\"machine house\\") in operation from 1671 to 1709, which began as a playhouse and gradually became a house for spectacle. Furthermore, grand opera had a high degree of spectacle in it. In the 17th century, when opera first came to England, it prompted enormously complex theatrical stagings to present illusions of ghosts, mythological figures, and epic battles. When Handel's arrival in England spurred a new vogue for English opera, it also caused a new vogue for imported opera, no matter the content, so long as it would create an enormous visual impact. Although some of the \\"Tory Wits\\" like Pope and John Gay wrote opera librettos (the two combining for Acis and Galatea with Handel), opera was a spectacular form of theater that left too little room for dramatic acting for most of the playwrights. Pope argued in The Dunciad that Handel's operas were \\"masculine\\" in comparison to Italian and French opera. While this is a musical commentary, it is also a commentary on the amount of decoration and frippery put on the stage, on the way that Handel's operas concentrated on their stories and music rather than their theatrical effects. It was not merely the fact that such operas drove out original drama, but also that the antics and vogue for the singers took away all else, seemingly, that infuriated English authors. The singers (particularly the sopranos) introduced London to the concept of the prima donna, in both senses of the term. In 1727, two Italian sopranos, Francesca Cuzzoni and Faustina Bordoni, had such a rivalry and hatred of each other (the latter had been paid more than the former) that the audiences were encouraged to support their favorite singer by hissing her rival, and during a performance of Astyanax in 1727, the two women actually began to fight on stage (Loughrey 13). John Gay wrote to Jonathan Swift on 3 February 1723: ::There's nobody allow'd to say I sing but an Eunuch or an Italian Woman. Every body is grown now as great a judge of Musick as they were in your time of Poetry & folks that could not distinguish one tune from another now daily dispute over different Styles of Handel, Bononcini, and Aitillio. People have now forgot Homer, and Virgil & Caesar. These operas were spectaculars in every sense. The personalities of the stars were before the stage, the stars were before the music, and the music before the words. Additionally, opera brought with it new stage machines and effects. Even Handel, whom Pope values as restrained and sober, had his heroine brought on stage by \\"two huge Dragons out of whose mouths issue Fire and Smoke\\" in Rinaldo in 1711. The \\"problem\\" of spectacle continued in the 1720s and 1730s. In 1734, Henry Fielding has his tragedian, Fustian, describe the horror of a pantomime show: ::intimating that after the audience had been tired with the dull works of Shakespeare, Jonson, Vanbrugh, and others, they are to be entertained with one of these pantomimes, of which the master of the playhouse, two or three painters, and half a score dancing-masters are the compilers. ...I have often wondered how it was possible for any creature of human understanding, after having been diverted for three hours with the production of a great genius, to sit for three more and see a set of people running about the stage after one another, without speaking one syllable, and playing several juggling tricks, which are done at Fawks's after a much better manner; and for this, sir, the town does not only pay additional prices, but loses several fine parts of its best authors, which are cut out to make room for the said farces. (Pasquin, V i.) Fustian complains as well that authors are denied stagings because of these entertainments, and, as well, that playhouse managers would steal plays from their authors. As Fustian says earlier, a playwright could spend four months trying to get a manager's attention and then \\"he tells you it won't do, and returns it to you again, reserving the subject, and perhaps the name, which he brings out in his next pantomime\\" (Pasquin IV i.). The reemergence of satirical drama, and the Licensing Act Toward the end of the 1720s, the behavior of opera stars, the absurdity of spectacle productions, and an escalation of political warfare between the two parties led to a reclamation of the stage by political dramatists. During the later years of King George I, who favored Robert Walpole, there was a scramble for the favor of the future King George II, his wife, and his mistress, and this combined with a shattering of public confidence in the government after the South Sea Bubble and revelations of corruption in the trial of Jonathan Wild, Charles Hitchen, the Earl of Macclesfield, and others. John Gay and comic inversion John Gay parodied the opera with his satirical Beggar's Opera (1728) and with it delivered a satire of Robert Walpole's actions during the South Sea Bubble. Superficially, the play is about a man named Macheath who runs a gang for a criminal fence named Peachum, whose daughter, Polly Peachum, is in love with him, and who escapes prison over and over again because the daughter of the jailor, Lucy Lockitt, is also in love with him. Peachum wishes to see Macheath hanged because Polly has married Macheath, unlike Lucy Lockitt, who is merely pregnant by him (and neither woman is concerned with Macheath's sexual activity, but only with whom he marries, for marriage means access to his estate when he is eventually hanged). Peachum fears that Macheath will turn him in to the law, and he also feels that marriage is a betrayal of good breeding, that prostitution is the genteel thing. Gay announced his intention to create the \\"ballad opera\\" with the play. The music for the songs came from tunes already popular, and ten of the tunes were from the satirist Tom D'Urfey, whose Pills to Purge Melancholy was a collection of coarse, bawdy, and amusing songs on various topics. The ballad was associated with folk songs and folk poetry, and so Gay's choice of using ballads (although ballads written by a well-known author) for his music was itself an attempt to deflate the seeming pomposity and elitism of the opera. For most of the audience, the central entertainment of the opera was the love triangle between Macheath, Polly, and Lucy, but satirically, the centre of the opera was the Peachum/Macheath story. This story was an obvious parallel with the case of Jonathan Wild (Peachum) and Jack Sheppard (Macheath). However, it was also the tale of Robert Walpole (Peachum) and the South Sea directors (Macheath). Robert Walpole was one of the most divisive ministers in British history, and his control of the House of Commons ran for over two decades. Until Margaret Thatcher, no other Prime Minister (the office would not exist in name until later) had as adversarial a relationship with authors, and he had ruthlessly consolidated power and jealously guarded it against all threats. During the South Sea Bubble, Walpole was accused of being \\"the screen,\\" protecting the moneyed directors of the corporation from prosecution and of cashing in his own shares for full value before the collapse of the stock. Further, during the life and career of the actual Jonathan Wild, Walpole's Whig ministry was suspected of protecting and supporting the master \\"thief-taker.\\" Additionally, Gay's opera was a strict parody and inversion of the opera. Gay has his thieves and prostitutes speak like upper-class gentlemen and ladies. Implicitly, he suggests that the nobles are no better than the thieves even as he suggests that thieves have their own mock-monarchies, senates, and religion. He has his Beggar (the putative author of the opera) explain that the two female leads have equal parts and therefore should not fight (a joke that witnesses of the diva battle would understand). The supernaturally lofty settings of opera are, in Gay's hands, the warrens of St Giles parish. For palace settings, he has prisons. For throne rooms, he has taverns. For kings, he has criminal fences. For knights errant/shepherd lovers, he has a highwayman. For goddesses drawn about on gilded chariots, he has a ruined maid, a chorus of prostitutes, and Polly (who is perversely chaste). The arias also use the same metaphors that were common in opera, and Gay's songs are themselves parodies of the predictable lyrics in opera. In each case, high and low trade places and Gay's suggestion of an essential likeness of the ministry with its most famous thief extended also to a suggestion that high opera is essentially like tavern songs and rounds. The play was a hit, running for an unheard-of eighty performances. Subsequently, the songs, as well as the play, were printed up and sold. Robert Walpole, who had some personal animosity to John Gay, attended the play and enjoyed it. However, upon learning from a friend that he was one of the targets of the satire, he tried to have the play stopped. When Gay wrote a follow-up called Polly, Walpole had the play suppressed before performance. The suppression was without precedent, although it was soon to be used as a precedent, for there had been no actual attack on the ministry. The anti-ministerial (Tory) sentiment was entirely derived from interpretation. Playwrights were therefore in straits. On the one hand, when the playhouses were not running operas imported wholesale from the continent, they were dispensing with dramatists by turning out hack-written pantomimes. On the other hand, when a satirical play appeared from a literary source, the Whig ministry suppressed it even though it came from the most popular dramatist of the day (i.e., John Gay). Furthermore, the grounds of the suppression were all implicit comparisons, and nothing explicit. Gay had not said that Walpole was a crook as bad as Wild, although he had suggested it. The new Tory wits, escalating satire, and the creation of the Licensing Act Frontispiece to Fielding's Tom Thumb, a play satirizing plays (and Robert Walpole) Robert Walpole's personal involvement in censoring entertainments critical of him only fanned the flames of the antagonism between himself and the stage. Henry Fielding, among others, was not afraid to provoke the ministry, and anti-Walpolean plays spiked after the suppression of Polly. Fielding's Tom Thumb (1730) was a satire on all of the tragedies written before him, with quotations from all the worst plays patched together for absurdity, and the plot concerned the eponymous tiny man attempting to run the kingdom and insinuate himself into the royal ranks. It was, in other words, an attack on Robert Walpole and the way that he was referred to as \\"the Great Man\\" and his supposed control over Caroline of Ansbach. As with Gay's Beggar's Opera, the miniature general speaks constantly in elevated tones, making himself a great hero, and all of the normal-sized ladies fight each other to be his lover. The contrast between reality, delusion, and self- delusion was a form of bathos that made the audience think of other grand- speaking and grandly spoken of people. If a ridiculously tiny figure could be acclaimed a hero because of his own braggadocio, might other great leaders be similarly small? Were they titans, or dwarves like Tom Thumb? Fielding announced, essentially, that the emperor had no clothes, the prime minister no greatness. Walpole responded by suppressing the performance of the play. Fielding was a justice of the peace by profession, and so he knew that the ministry could only control the stage and not book publication. Therefore, he tapped into the market for printed plays, and his revision of the play was solely in book form. It was written by \\"Scribblerus Secundus,\\" its title page announced (a reference to the Scriblerus Club of Jonathan Swift, Gay, Pope, Robert Harley, Thomas Parnell, John Arbuthnot, and Henry St. John), and it was the Tragedy of Tragedies, which did for drama what Pope's Peri Bathos: or The Art of Sinking in Poetry had done for verse. Fielding placed a critical apparatus on the play, showing the sources of all the parodies, and thereby made it seem as if his target had all along been bad tragedy and not the prime minister. (Fielding's later novel, Jonathan Wild, makes it clear that such was not the case, for it used exactly the same satirical device, \\"the Great Man,\\" to lambaste the same target, Robert Walpole.) Henry Fielding was not done with ministry satire. His Covent-Garden Tragedy of 1732 was set in a brothel amongst the prostitutes. Although the play was only acted once, it, like Tom Thumb, sold when printed. Its attacks on poetic license and the antirealism of domestic tragedians and morally sententious authors was an attack on the values central to the Whig version of personal worth. Two years later, Fielding was joined by Henry Carey in anti-Walpolean satire. His Chrononhotonthologos takes its cue from Tom Thumb by outwardly satirizing the emptiness of bombast. However, it also encoded a very specific and dangerous satire of King George II and his statutory wife. The king and queen never meet in the play, and the subject is the former's wars with personal discomfort and the latter's desire for adultery. In particular, the Queen herself is implicitly attacked. However, the play also appears to be a superficial work of fancy and nonsense verse, and it delighted audiences with tongue twisters and parody. However, Carey worked The Dragon of Wantley into a play in 1734. Fielding and Carey, among others, picked up the cudgels where the Tory Wits had set them down and began to satirize Walpole and Parliament with increasing ferocity (and scatology). Although a particular play of unknown authorship entitled A Vision of the Golden Rump was cited when Parliament passed the Licensing Act of 1737 (the \\"rump\\" being Parliament, a rump roast, and human buttocks simultaneously), Carey's Dragon of Wantley was an unmistakable attack on tax policy and the ever-increasing power of the London government over the countryside. Notably, Fielding's and Carey's plays made allowances for spectacle. Indeed, their plays relied upon a burlesque of spectacle and by spectacle, for the effects of TopsyTurvy armies in Chrononhotonthologos (stacked atop each other instead of in ranks) and the titular dragon of Wantley, as well as the miniaturizing of Tom Thumb and the lurid scenery of the Covent Garden brothel, were part of the draw and part of the humor for these plays. The Licensing Act required all plays to go to a censor before staging, and only those plays passed by the censor were allowed to be performed. Therefore, plays were judged by potential criticism of the ministry and not just by reaction or performance. The first play to be banned by the new Act was Gustavus Vasa by Henry Brooke. The play invoked the Swedish Protestant king Gustav Vasa to castigate the purportedly corrupt Parliament of Walpole's administration, although Brooke would claim that he meant only to write a history play. Samuel Johnson wrote a Swiftian parodic satire of the licensers, entitled A Complete Vindication of the Licensers of the Stage (1739). The satire was, of course, not a vindication at all but rather a reductio ad absurdum of the position for censorship. Had the licensers not exercised their authority in a partisan manner, the Act might not have chilled the stage so dramatically, but the public was well aware of the bannings and censorship, and consequently any play that did pass the licensers was regarded with suspicion by the public. Therefore, the playhouses had little choice but to present old plays and pantomime and plays that had no conceivable political content. One consequence was that William Shakespeare's reputation grew enormously as his plays saw a quadrupling of performances, and sentimental comedy and melodrama were the only \\"safe\\" choices for new drama. Dramatists themselves had to turn to prose or to less obvious forms of criticism, such as puppet shows that Charlotte Charke would invest in. Effects of the Licensing Act Othello \\"strikes\\" Desdemona in Othello from the 1744 Thomas Hanmer deluxe edition of William Shakespeare. Hanmer's was one of the \\"improved\\" editions that was roundly hissed by textual critics. In comedy, one effect of the Licensing Act was that playwrights began to develop a comedy of sentiment. This comedy was critically labeled as \\"high\\" comedy, in that it was intended to be entertaining rather than actually be funny, and brought about its entertainment by elevating the sentiments of the viewer. The plots also relied upon characters being in or out of sympathy with each other. Very late in the 17th century Oliver Goldsmith attempted to resist the tide of sentimental comedy with She Stoops to Conquer (1773), and Richard Brinsley Sheridan would mount several satirical plays after Walpole's death. Both of these playwrights were taking advantage of a loosening of the censorship and popular weariness with \\"refined\\" comedy. Goldsmith's play reintroduces the country bumpkin character who outwits the sophisticated would-be rakes who are engaged in a plot to marry well. Sheridan, on the other hand, very consciously turned back to the Restoration comedy for his models but carefully toned down the dangers of the sexual plots. As mentioned above, another effect of the Licensing Act was to send the playhouses to old plays. Since any play written before 1737 could be staged without permission, theaters had a great deal to choose from. However, they sought out Shakespeare, in particular, as the one author whose name alone could generate an audience as large as those formerly provided by leading poets. Shakespeare's stature had been rising throughout the 18th century, and textual criticism, particularly of Shakespeare, had resulted in reliable texts (see Shakespeare's reputation for details). Further, many of the expurgated and \\"improved\\" versions of Shakespeare were falling from favor. Actors such as David Garrick made their entire reputations by playing Shakespeare. The Licensing Act may be the single greatest factor in the rise of \\"Bardolatry.\\" However, other, less sparkling, plays were also revived, including multiple versions of Lady Jane Grey and The Earl of Essex (including one by Henry Brooke that had been written before the Act). Each of these could be used as a tacit commentary on the politics of the contemporary court and as a political gesture. Therefore, when playhouses wished to answer the public's political sentiment, they could quickly mount a performance of Cato or one of the Lady Jane Greys or, if the mood was otherwise, one of Aphra Behn's royalist plays, and some of the Restoration plays such as William Wycherly's The Plain Dealer and William Congreve's The Way of the World were always promising comedy. However, when they needed to fill the house reliably, regardless of political season, and show off their actors, they staged Shakespeare. David Garrick, a celebrity actor, starring as King Richard III in Colley Cibber's revision of Shakespeare's play six years after the Licensing Act Finally, authors with strong political or philosophical points to make would no longer turn to the stage as their first hope of making a living. Prior to 1737, plays were de rigueur for authors who were not journalists. This had to do with the economics of booksellers. A bookseller would purchase a book from an author, whether that book was Gulliver's Travels or Collected Sermons, and would calculate his chances of making money off of sales. He would pay the author according to the money he expected to make. (For example, Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield was famously sold to pay a single rent installment, whereas John Gay had been paid 1,000 pounds for his Poems on Various Occasions, which was more than seven years of salary for his government job). That would be the only money an author would see from the book, and therefore he or she would need to produce a new version, new book, or a serial publication of the next work to have hopes of more income. Prior to 1737, novelists had come from the ranks of satirists (Jonathan Swift) and journalists (Daniel Defoe), but these novels had in common wide changes of scenery, long plots, and often impossible things (such as talking horses)‚Äîall features that made the works unsuitable for the stage. The exception was Aphra Behn, who was a dramatist first and a novelist second. Her Oroonoko seems to have been written as a novel simply because there was no time for staging, as it was a political commentary on ongoing events, and she could not have another play on the boards at the time. Her Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister, like Gulliver's Travels and Moll Flanders, was inappropriate for the stage. However, after 1737, novels began to have dramatic structures involving only normal human beings, as the stage was closed off for serious authors. Additionally, prior to 1737 the economic motivations for dramatists were vast. A playwright received the house take of the third night of a play. This could be a very large amount of money, and it would be renewed with each season (depending upon arrangements). Thus, John Gay grew wealthy with The Beggar's Opera. In 1726, Leonard Welsted's indifferent success, The Dissembled Woman, was acted at Lincoln's Inn Fields. It netted him ¬£138 for the author's benefit but only ¬£30 for the printing rights. After the Licensing Act closed off hopes for serious authors on the stage, the novel was the next logical path. In particular, Samuel Richardson's Clarissa was published in serial form and made the author a substantial amount of money from subscriptions. The novel became a potentially lucrative form of publishing, and booksellers began to pay more for novels as novels began to sell more. From being a form of exigency, the novel became a form of choice after the stage was shut down by the Licensing Act. Therefore, the Licensing Act had the unintended effect of increasing rather than decreasing the power of dissenting authors, as it put a stop to anti-Walpolean sentiments and anti-ministry arguments on the stage (which could only reach audience members in London) and sent these messages instead to the novel form, where they would remain in print, pass from hand to hand, and spread throughout the kingdom.

Early life Eduardo (commonly known as ‚ÄòEd‚Äô) Castrillo was born in Santa Ana, Manila, Philippines on October 31, 1942, the youngest of five children to Santiago Silva Castrillo and Magdalena De los Santos. His father worked as a jeweler, while his mother was a leading actress in zarzuelas and Holy Week pageants. Castrillo‚Äôs early years were marked by adversity and challenges.Carlomar Daoana, ‚ÄúA Monumental Life‚Äù. Art+ Magazine, 5 October 2016. His mother died when he was not yet two, he changed schools several times and he was depressed as a teenager to the point of being suicidal.Ibid. He found his place however after he entered the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, where he earned a degree in Fine Arts. Looking for work following his graduation, he approached Levy Hermanos, the owner of the well- known La Estrella del Norte studio in Manila. Hermanos challenged him to design a piece of jewelry then and there. Castrillo responded by producing seven studies, in full color, within twenty minutes. Needless to say, he was hired on the spot as a jewelry designer.Ibid., also Dale Dennis David et al. Filipino Pride. Manila, Philippines: Filipino Matters, 2009, p. 56. The year was 1964. Professional career Castrillo broke onto the Filipino arts scene in 1966, when he held his first one-man show at the Northern Motors showroom in Makati. That same year, his first major public sculptures were unveiled ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Virgin‚Äù at La Loma Cemetery and ‚ÄúYouth‚Äôs Cry of Defiance‚Äù in Fort Santiago, both in Metro Manila. During the 1970s, the height of Martial Law under the Marcos dictatorship, Castrillo was considered to be the most avant- garde sculptor in the Philippines.Daoana, op cit. By the 1980s, Castrillo‚Äôs reputation as a leading artist in his country was beyond dispute. He traveled extensively abroad on cultural visits, giving lectures and conducting research into the origins of early Filipino art. Castrillo‚Äôs main medium was metal, especially brass, bronze and steel, from which he created sculptures by hammering, cutting and welding, with the help of a group of assistants. He also incorporated other materials into his works, including wood, plastic, plexiglass, ivory and even neon lights. His oeuvre included free-standing abstract pieces, functional art pieces, art jewelry, body sculptures and liturgical art. As well as being avant-garde, he was known as a nationalist and for his commitment to the Filipino people. As he told an interviewer from the American news agency, the Associated Press: Several of Castrillo‚Äôs most important works are monumental sculptures commemorating Filipino historical events or personalities, including Rajah Sulayman (1976), the People Power Monument (1993), The Battle of Zapote Bridge (1997) and the Andres Bonifacio Shrine (1998). Outside of the Philippines, his sculptures can be found in France, Singapore, Malaysia and Guam, among other places.David et al., op. cit., p. 56 Castrillo served at one time as the head of the Art Association of the Philippines.‚ÄúArt Community Mourns Passing of Sculptor Eduardo Castrillo‚Äù, GMA News, 20 May 2016.

He works with Steve Blass, Bob Walk, and John Wehner. Originally, Brown called games with Lanny Frattare until Frattare retired after the 2008 season. Brown grew up in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. He became a Pirates fan through the broadcasts on KDKA radio and would visit Pittsburgh each summer with his parents to see baseball games at Three Rivers Stadium. Brown enrolled at Point Park College and landed an internship with the Pirates' promotion department in 1979, where his duties included serving as the inaugural backup Pirate Parrot. (The Pirates would go on to win the World Series that year.) He then worked in the Pirates' front office for 10 years in a variety of roles for the sales, broadcasting and public relations departments. He was the public address announcer in 1987 and did weekend sports anchoring at WFMJ-TV in Youngstown, Ohio in 1988. Brown spent five seasons (1989‚Äì93) doing play-by-play for the Pirates' Class AAA affiliate in Buffalo, NY. He also hosted a sports talk show on WGR radio. For three seasons (1991‚Äì93), Brown was the color analyst on Buffalo Bills radio broadcasts and also hosted pre-game and post-game shows for the Bills games. (The Bills would advance to the Super Bowl in each of Brown's three seasons as a broadcaster.) He also called basketball games for the Buffalo Bulls. Brown is known for his call \\"Raise the Jolly Roger\\" after every Pirates win. This is keeping in line with Pirate broadcasters, such as Lanny Frattare and Bob Prince, who also ended each Pirate win with a distinctive statement (\\"We had 'em all the way!\\" for Prince and \\"There was no doubt about it!\\" for Frattare). He is also known to exclaim \\"Clear the deck, cannonball coming!\\" on home runs hit by the Pirates, as well as \\"It's a trip-trip-triple!\\" when Pirates players hit triples. A report by Minnesota based Bring Me The News declared Brown the losingest active play by play announcer in MLB. At the time of the article, Brown had called 2,133 losses and held a .454 winning percentage. Brown and his wife Kim have one son, Ryan.

In addition to his architectural practice, he developed his skills and the market for architectural journalism. His views of church design disagreed with those of churchmen with power to commission new churches and this work dropped off after he published his ideas in Weale's Quarterly papers on Architecture in 1844/5. He married twice but had no children and died at Portishead on 9 July 1872. Life and work Early years Wightwick was born in Alyn Bank, near Mold, Flintshire, Wales and trained in London under Edward Lapidge. Following a year of travel and study in Italy, he published Select Views of Roman Antiquities (1828) . Plymouth In the late 1820s, Wightwick moved to Plymouth, and worked with John Foulston, succeeding to Foulston's practice after six months. From then until 1852, when he retired to Bristol, he completed many public and domestic buildings, mostly in Plymouth, Devon and Cornwall. Wightwick, who was a member of The Plymouth Institution (now The Plymouth Athenaeum), was well known in Plymouth as an architect and as an amateur actor and comedian.

An example of this is his relationship with the Fox family of Falmouth, as described by siblings Barclay and Caroline, who both kept journals which were published in the 1970s.Barclay's journal cited above, The journals of Caroline Fox, 1835‚Äì1871: a selection, ed. Wendy Monk ; London, Paul Elek, (1972) Barclay Fox notes the brilliant lecture that Wightwick gave at the Polytechnic: \\"The Romance of Architecture\\" (entry: 3 October 1838); their companionship at the meeting of the British Association in Plymouth (entry: 29 July 1841); and his visit to the new Bodmin Lunatic Asylum with Wightwick (the architect) (entry: 23 August 1841). Caroline Fox describes Wightwick's witty tabletalk, when he dined at Penjerrick, the Fox family home (entries: 6 April 1839 and 25 October 1839); her attendance at a lecture he gave (entry: 18 January 1849); and news that he would move to Clifton (entry: 27 June 1851). Through this long period, Wightwick kept contact with this family of \\"opinion-formers\\" and powerful social networkers. Writings His first work was Select Views of Roman Antiquities (1828).

James and his sole sibling, a sister 13 years older than he was, had a modest upbringing. His father, a pulp mill worker, and his mother, a homemaker, maintained a small, clapboard house. While neither of his parents had more than an eighth grade education, Mr. Stukel would say of them, \\"my father had a real gift for numbers. He could do things in his head that were remarkable, and my mother was extremely sharp until the day she died...they were...bright.\\" His parents began to save for his college education soon after his birth. Mr. Stukel's parents instilled in him a strong work ethic. He would later say, \\"they were pretty stern regarding my grades and homework...and I always worked.\\" In third grade, James joined the school band. He would practice three to five hours each day on his saxophone. Of his band experience, he said, \\"nothing was given; it was earned.\\" He would credit his band experiences to force him to set goals. According to James, his \\"whole life...is based around competition and goal setting.\\" In junior high, James started a paper route to earn income. In high school, he entered into student politics and was elected junior class president.

He would later joke, \\"the University of Illinois wasn't in his vocabulary, but he took over the decision making process.\\" James enrolled at Purdue and joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. To help pay for school, James played saxophone with his dance band, The Spotlighters. The band played music from Woody Herman, Stan Getz, and other jazz artists. During the summer, James would play at resorts. It was at Purdue that James met his wife Joan Helpling, a majorette with the Purdue marching band. The two toured Europe as members of a variety band. They would marry during their senior years. Stukel would later comment on his wife, \\"I [have] been...lucky in that I have a very supportive wife who...influenced the way I developed...in...positive ways.\\" Stukel graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering from Purdue shortly after his marriage. The couple then moved to Virginia. He earned his M.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

During 1958‚Äì59, Stein published two monster magazines, Monster Parade and Monsters and Things.  Foundation of Lancer  As various genre magazines became less common, Stein decided to close down Royal Publications and begin publishing paperback originals. He and Zacharius launched Lancer Books in June 1961 at 26 West 47th Street.

Wells, Jules Verne, Rudyard Kipling, Samuel Clemens, Charles Dickens, Robert Louis Stevenson, Jane Austen, Helen Keller and Bram Stoker. Besides the complete and unabridged text, each book included a brief, unsigned biographical article about the author. Because the works were in the public domain, Lancer included a copyright notice for the special contents (i.e., the biographical information) for each book. Lancer also published books of social commentary, such as The Angry Black, edited by John Williams. Lancer's popular culture titles included The Beatle Book (1964).

Of all the show's presenters, Brian Matthew is perhaps the best remembered. Many of the top bands performed on it, and for millions of British teenagers it was essential viewing. As well as featuring British artists, it often included American guest stars. It would appear from the surviving footage that the bands mimed their latest 45. Occasionally a band was allowed to do two numbers (possibly the A-side and B-side sides of the latest single or an EP or LP track); bands of a higher status such as The Beatles or The Rolling Stones would sometimes play up to as many as four numbers. A typical 1961 programme listing included The Dale Sisters, Adam Faith, John Leyton, The Brook Brothers, Geoff Goddard and Dion. Audience participation was a strong feature of Thank Your Lucky Stars, and the Spin-a-Disc section, where a guest DJ and three teenagers reviewed three singles, is a very well remembered feature of the show. Generally American singles were reviewed. It was on this section that Janice Nicholls appeared. She was a former office clerk from the English Midlands who became famous for the catchphrase \\"Oi'll give it foive\\" which she said with a strong Black Country accent. After she was dropped from the show she trained as a chiropodist and ran a practice in Hednesford in Staffordshire. Billy Butler was another reviewer. The Beatles second national television performance was on the programme, the first being on children's programme Tuesday Rendezvous on 4 December 1962. The first theme song was by Peter Knight & The Knightriders and later on \\"Lunar Walk\\" by Johnny Hawksworth was used. The show ended on 25 June 1966, after two thousand artists appearances. The Musicians' Union were not in favour of such shows as the songs were mimed until the change of policy in 1966.

The Charleston riot occurred on March 28, 1864, in Charleston, Illinois, after Union soldiers and local Republicans clashed with local insurgent Democrats known as Copperheads. By the time the riot had subsided, nine were dead and twelve had been wounded. It is generally thought that one of the events that triggered the riot was the treatment of Judge Charles H. Constable by Union soldiers. The soldiers humiliated Constable by making him swear allegiance to the federal government, due to his decision to allow four Union deserters to go free in Marshall, Illinois. When the riot began, Judge Constable was holding court in Charleston. Copperheads The Charleston riot took place around this courthouse The news coverage of the event stated that the Peace Democrats were responsible for beginning the event. One such news source, from the Chicago Tribune, later reprinted in the Charleston Courier, labeled Nelson Wells as the instigator of the conflict. Most articles published from the time, insist that the whole event transpired as a more spontaneous event and was not directly prompted by any one individual. The most likely explanation is that the event occurred because a sizable presence of both Copperheads and Union soldiers had been in town that day. Also many sources speculate that a sizable portion of the participants, at least on the side of the Peace Democrats, had been drinking quite heavily all day, and this led to the outbreak that resulted in the confrontation. At any rate, the fighting only lasted a few moments. But by the time the affair was over, the Copperheads had been run out of Charleston. Rewards had been issued for the capture of any of those whom fled the scene. Included in those who left town, was John O‚ÄôHair, the leader of the Copperheads, who had been the sheriff of Coles County. Out of those killed, only two had been Copperheads, Nelson Wells and John Cooper; the other participants had been either captured or escaped. Other Union troops were called in from Mattoon to assist the soldiers fighting in Charleston, but by the time their train arrived, none of the instigators were left in the town. Fifteen prisoners were eventually held for seven months, initially in Springfield, Illinois. President Lincoln, whose father and stepmother had lived in Coles County, waived the prisoners' right to Habeas Corpus and ordered their removal to Fort Delaware in the East. He ordered their release on November 4, 1864. Two of the prisoners had been indicted for murder and were exonerated by trial in December, 1864. Twelve other Copperheads had also been indicted for murder. They were never captured, and the indictments were annulled in May 1873. The terms Copperheads and Butternuts were used to describe the larger movement, which has been known as Peace Democrats. This political affiliation which stirred up support, as David Montgomery points out in Beyond Equality: Labor and the Radical Republicans, by incorporating the fears that the federal government‚Äôs war effort sought to usurp the constitution. The copperheads incorporated a racial component to their disdain for the Republican war effort, as Montgomery points out, that emancipated Negroes would flood the North, because of the Emancipation Proclamation. Using racially charged rhetoric, Copperheads sought to unite opposition to the Radical Republicans. This had become a national phenomenon during the American Civil War. Democrat sympathizers were battling to keep their country from becoming, in their eyes, too radical. Coles County Coles County, Illinois, 1875. The Copperheads represented a political affiliation that was staunchly opposed to President Lincoln, the draft, and abolition of slavery. This group favored an armistice to end the Civil War because they opposed the war itself. Most components of Copperhead ideology centered on the mistrust of the implications the war presented to American society. In particular, the aim to free the slaves had become an issue that some white natives of Illinois took issue with. The Civil War had split the country into factions, either side chose to support or oppose the aim to reincorporate the Southern states back into the Union. The Copperheads believed the Lincoln Administration had been out of line by abolishing slavery. Some citizens of Coles County accepted the ideology that it was not in the best interest of the country to free the slaves. Although the exact number is hard to gauge it has been estimated, by Victor Hicken in Illinois in the Civil War, that Coles County had been a significant pocket of Copperhead sympathizers. This idea is supported by the fact that John O‚ÄôHair, the leader of the Copperheads, had been the sheriff of Coles County during the Civil War. In the end, the Charleston Riot provides a good example of how local events of Coles County history have fit into national currents as well. The Copperheads of Coles County had been different from other dissenting groups from around the country, in that they chose to use physical violence as their method of dissent. By killing Union soldiers, who had become the emblem of Federal government control, the Copperheads were attempting to project their anger toward the government. The draft, a strong central government, and racism fueled the Copperheads support within the county. In March 1864, these national tensions boiled over in the small town of Charleston, creating one of the most interesting events in the history of the county. 54th Illinois Infantry Regiment The Adjutant General's Report records the event. ‚Ä≥January 1864, three-fourths of the Regiment re-enlisted, as veteran volunteers, and were mustered February 9th, 1864. Left for Mattoon, Illinois, for veteran furlough, March 28th. Veteran furlough having expired, the Regiment re- assembled at Mattoon. The same day an organized gang of Copperheads, led by Sheriff O‚ÄôHair, attacked some men of the Regiment at Charleston, killing Major Shubal York, Surgeon, and four privates, and wounding Colonel G. M. Mitchell. One hour later the Regiment arrived from Mattoon and occupied the town, capturing some of the most prominent traitors.‚Ä≥ Dyer's Regimental History records the riot in the Regimental Battle Honors ‚Ä≥Veterans on furlough March and April.

Rothaus, at the northern edge of the village of Grafenhausen in the southern Black Forest, is one of Germany's most successful and profitable regional breweries. History Administrative building of the Rothaus brewery Rothaus received its name from the patrician family \\"Roth\\", which originated from the region of Klettgau and settled down in Grafenhausen around 1300 AD. In 1340, they began the construction of their homestead there, the ‚Äú‚Äù (Ger.: \\"The Red House\\"). In 1660, the house was sold to a man named Michael Kaiser who would then proceed to turn it into an Inn after obtaining a liquor license from the Benedictine monastery of St. Blasien. The order itself bought the premises 100 years later and reconstructed it. Under the leadership of Martin Gerbert, prince-abbot of the abbey, the monks' council decided in late 1790 to start attempts of brewing in January 1791. Gerbert's intention was to enhance the status of his lordship of Bonndorf over the nearby princedom of F√ºrstenberg. F√ºrstenberg had been in possession of a brewing license since the 13th century and would later originate the ‚Äú‚Äù (F√ºrstenberg Brewery). Additionally, the brewery was a measure of economic promotion, as it was intended to create employment and to counteract the allegedly overpriced beer from Donaueschingen. However, there were claims that the monks had only wanted to suppress the drinking of liquor by those living in the Black Forest. Considering the nearby towns of St. Blasien and Bonndorf, the location of the brewery was very convenient in terms of infrastructure; it was surrounded by large areas covered with woods and an abundance of fresh water. This enabled the starting of an extensive brewery firm. To this day, the brewing water is extracted from seven in-house wells. Through the process of secularization, the possession of the monastery and its properties was transferred to the Grand Duchy of Baden in 1806. Since then, the brewery has been known as the (Grand ducal state-owned brewery of Baden). The November Revolution of 1918, which led to the abolition of the monarchy in Baden, caused the company to shorten their name to (State-owned brewery of Baden), as from then on the brewery was owned by the state of Baden. Since 1922, the company has had the legal form of a stock corporation, the shares of which are currently held entirely by the associated company of the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Between 1920 and 1933, Max J√§ger, later mayor of the city of Rastatt, was the Rothaus brewery's manager. Under CEO Norbert Nothhelfer, who had previously been a district president of Freiburg, Rothaus doubled its beer sales in a shrinking market in the 1990s. Capacity was increased to one million hectolitres per year. In 1992, Rothaus acquired the Dominican Island of Constance including the island resort on it, which is leased to the Steigenberger Hotel Group. On 1 October 2004, Thomas Sch√§uble, former Minister of the Interior of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, became CEO of the brewery. In the fiscal year 2006, the brewery achieved a production volume of 937,000 hectoliters and revenue of 88.2 million Euros, making it the second largest brewery in the state after Eichbaum. Approximately 90 percent of the brewery's sales are made in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Near the end of 2007, Rothaus acquired the hotel next to the brewery area and set up a fan shop there. Within an area of about one hectare a small adventure park containing the Z√§pfleweg, which opened in 2008, as well as a playground, were created. In addition, state road 170 was relocated and a roundabout was built in order to make it more attractive as a destination. a total of 232 people are employed in Rothaus and its two sales offices. After Thomas Sch√§uble became seriously ill, Gerhard Stratthaus, former Finance Minister of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, took over the management of the brewery on 5 September 2012. Since 1 July 2013, the company has been managed by Christian Rasch. Rasch is the first nonpolitician in decades to be the manager of the State Brewery. It used to be common practice for former state governments to fill state-owned enterprises' leadership positions with former politicians. This practice, however, sparked much public criticism. Hence, agriculture minister Alexander Bonde arranged the first job advertisement for this position. Egon Zehnder's Swiss headhunter company was hired to assist with the job advertisement. Rasch had been sales and marketing manager of the Stuttgarter Hofbr√§u brewery since 2008, and became the management's spokesperson in 2010. The newspaper \\"\\" described Rasch's switch from Stuttgarter Hofbr√§u to Rothaus as \\"spectacular\\" because to the circumstances under which it happened. In 2016, the brand \\"Tannenz√§pfle\\" celebrated its 60th year of existence with a sixtieth anniversary edition of the original 1956 label design. Products Bottle Tannenz√§pfle Rothaus Hefeweizen Z√§pfle The brewery's most successful product, a Pilsner-style beer, \\"\\" or simply \\"\\", is sold in bottles and is available in stores throughout Baden-W√ºrttemberg. It is well known as a \\"cult beer\\" throughout Germany and is sold in supermarkets, kiosks and various nightlife establishments. literally means \\"little fir cone\\" and is a reference to the shape of the bottle. Despite Rothaus refraining from intensive advertising campaigns, the demand for the once-local beer has spread throughout Germany.  Label  Every bottle‚Äôs label displays a blonde girl in a traditional garb, holding a beer in each of her hands. Fans of the beer started to call her ‚ÄúBiergit Kraft‚Äù which is a play on words in the local dialect of Alemannic. \\"Bier git Kraft\\", (\\"Bier gibt Kraft\\") translates to \\"beer gives [you] strength\\". By now, the brewery also uses the name in commercials. Also depicted on the Tannenz√§pfle label are seven fir cones which lead to the beers name. Interestingly, instead of hanging downwards as in the image, in nature these cones grow upwards from their branches. The inverted position of the cones is commonly noted to be similar to the position of a bottle while it is being consumed. In reality however, the cones depicted on the label are probably the seeds of the Norway spruce, which naturally grows in the Black Forest and has its cones hanging down from its branches. The current label has been in use since 1972. The girl and fir cones were introduced in the first label in 1956 as part of a photorealistic illustration. The original label was used again as a limited edition in 2006 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the brand.  Advertising  Rothaus does advertisements throughout the German states of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate, North-Rhine-Westphalia, Hamburg and Hesse, though they completely abstain the usage of TV- and radio commercials. The company does sponsor sports clubs like, among others, the SC Freiburg, Karlsruher SC, FC N√∂ttingen, VfR Aalen and W√∂lfe Freiburg as well as various events throughout the region. They not only own the right to a name for the venues of the Messe Friedrichshafen (Rothaus Halle) and Messe Freiburg (Rothaus-Arena from 2007-2016), but also for the park of the Messe Stuttgart (Rothauspark). In other sports, the brewery is main sponsor for the Rothaus cycling team and the HSG Konstanz, a handball team currently playing in the 2. Handball-Bundesliga. Through sponsorship they also lend their name to the Rothaus Regio-Tour. Rothaus was involved in the construction of the Rothaus-Z√§pfle-Turm, which is an observation tower near the township of H√∂chenschwand. They also own two refrigerator cars in a railway look which are parked in Seebrugg at the Bundesstra√üe 500 and work as a permanent advertisement ‚Äì at the exact spot, where the road branches off to Rothaus. The region the brewery is located in, has branded itself ‚ÄúRothauser Land ‚Äì Meine Ferienregion im Schwarzwald‚Äù (my vacation destination in the Black Forest) since 2006. ‚ÄúRothauser Land‚Äù includes the main cities Grafenhausen and √úhlingen-Birkendorf. As a brand recognition they even included the brewery‚Äôs characters into their logo. Economic significance Text on the administrative building The brewery experienced a doubling of its output in the 1990s under the direction of the new chairman of the board, Norbert Nothelfer, who had previously been employed in a position comparable to governor of a sub-division of a state. This, while noteworthy in itself, is more remarkable in light of the recent trend of decreasing beer consumption by Germans. The capacity was increased to one million hectoliters of beer. In the business year 2008, the brewery produced of beer, grossing roughly ‚Ç¨89.2 million. In 2011, the output was . The company is an important employer in the otherwise economically weak area of the south-central Black Forest. In 2008, the brewery employed 230 people and paid ‚Ç¨17 million as dividends to its owner, the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. It also paid ‚Ç¨16.7 million in tax. Next to F√ºrstenberg Brewery, it is one of the two larger breweries in the south- west of Baden-W√ºrttemberg.

The tunnels are the first and only twin‚Äìbored tunnels in the UK motorway network. The tunnels and adjacent M4 motorway Usk bridge were originally planned by Newport Corporation in August 1959 in a plan submitted to the Ministry of Transport. Work started on the ¬£3m tunnels project - led by engineer Sir Owen Williams on 10 September 1962. Both structures were complete and open to traffic on 5 May 1967. During the construction several houses on Brynglas Road (where the modern Newport Lodge Hotel now stands) had to be demolished due to structural weaknesses caused by the tunnelling and prompting questions in the House of Commons. Traffic congestion The western portals Almost as soon as the M4 Newport bypass (junctions 24-28) had opened, the traffic levels had grown to such a degree that the road had to be widened to three lanes in each direction. This was finished in 1982 but with the exception of the tunnels and Usk bridge which remained as dual two-lane sections (Junctions 25-26). M4 sliproads at Junction 25 (Caerleon Road) are diverted to reduce traffic through the tunnels. M4 Westbound traffic joining at Junction 25 is diverted via Junction 25A/A4042 (Heidenheim Drive)/A4051 (Malpas Road) to Junction 26. Similarly eastbound traffic wishing to exit at Junction 25 is diverted from Junction 26 via the A4051/A4042/Junction 25A. This adds to congestion on Malpas Road and other local roads near Newport city centre at peak times. The tunnels remain a bottleneck on the motorway. Partly due to regular tailbacks at the tunnels, a variable speed limit is in place between junctions 24 and 28. A new M4 relief road south of Newport was proposed, but on 15 July 2009 the scheme was dropped by the National Assembly for Wales. Hence the A48 Southern Distributor Road, a two-lane dual carriageway connecting M4 junction 24 to junction 28, remains the alternative route. In March 2012 the National Assembly for Wales published options for consultation including the option to bore further tunnels.Brynglas Tunnel consultation Fire On 26 July 2011, a lorry fire caused both tunnels to be completely closed. The articulated lorry, belonging to Hingley Transport, caught fire upon entering the west-bound tunnel entrance, but due to the nature of the damage to the lorry it was unable to exit the tunnel. Attempts by the driver to disconnect the cargo- section from the lorry cab failed, as the fire intensified tyres on the vehicle started to explode and the lorry driver was driven to safety by motorist Ashley Hall Daily Post \\"Motorist tells of lorry driver‚Äôs Brynglas tunnels escape\\", accessed 27 July 2011. who had stopped further back towards the entrance of the tunnel to block and prevent vehicles behind from entering the smoke-filled tunnel, before rapidly accelerating into the tunnel to pick up the driver and escape the blaze and subsequent explosions.South Wales Argus \\"M4 TUNNEL BLAZE: I rescued lorry driver seconds before explosion\\", accessed 27 July 2011.

Stanfield is a young, ambitious, intelligent and cold-blooded player and head of the eponymous Stanfield Organization in the Baltimore drug trade. Marlo's organization starts out small-time, competing with the larger Barksdale Organization, but rises to the top of the Baltimore drug trade fairly quickly. A repeated theme in Marlo's characterization is his demand for unconditional respect, which supersedes all other concerns. He frequently orders the deaths of those who disrespect him or undermine his name on the streets, however unwittingly, and is arguably the most violent and unscrupulous of the drug kingpins portrayed in The Wire. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked him #2 of their \\"40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\\". Character background and plot relations Marlo's background prior to his drug empire is largely unexplored. He was a previous suspect in an unsolved case for Vernon Holley; Holley believed it was Marlo who killed his only witness as well as the original victims, yet no evidence could be traced back to him. The Barksdale Organization already had all the prime territory on the westside in the form of the public housing towers, and Avon Barksdale had little interest in the street corners. Marlo's established rule and reputation is only noticed by the returning Barksdale dealers and soldiers after City Hall demolishes the towers, and Avon wishes to return to their roots in the streets, which escalates an all-out war over the best territory of the westside. Season 3 Marlo is introduced in season 3 as an up-and-coming drug player who controls many corners in West Baltimore. Marlo and his primary enforcer Chris Partlow wage war with the Barksdale crew over this territory. Marlo's ambition is to seek full control of the drug trade in West Baltimore. Following the demolition of their project buildings, the Barksdale Organization approaches Marlo by way of Bodie Broadus to discuss sharing territory in exchange for a supply of the Barksdales' high quality heroin. Marlo refuses to acknowledge Bodie, who has set up his own crew within Stanfield established territory, and insists that Bodie move his people away. Marlo later has one of his dealers, Fruit, and his crew give Bodie's crew a beating, demonstrating that Marlo is not going to lie down and let the Barksdale organization move into his territory. Stringer Bell visits Marlo personally to try to convince him to join the New Day Co-Op, a group of Baltimore drug players who buy packages of narcotics together to receive a discount and who try to reduce the violence of their business in order to avoid police attention. Marlo listens to Stringer without comment, and shortly after Stringer leaves, tells Chris to prepare for war. Unbeknownst to Marlo and Stringer, their meeting has been observed by Kima Greggs and Jimmy McNulty, although they initially assume that Marlo is working for the Barksdale organization like many other crews in the West side. Greggs and McNulty pay a visit to the Homicide division to learn more about Marlo and find that Vernon Holley had investigated Marlo for a murder. Holley had built a case against Marlo using a key witness who was murdered before the case went to trial. Holley believes Marlo killed the witness and describes Marlo as \\"the spawn of the devil\\". When a failed Barksdale assault on a Stanfield corner results in the deaths of two Barksdale soldiers, the Major Crimes Unit realizes that Marlo's crew is independent of the Barksdale organization, and that the two gangs are at war. The assault has been triggered by Avon's parole, and Avon's more confrontational approach to the turf war than Stringer's. Marlo thinks the failed assault shows a lack of strength in the Barksdale organization, and discusses this with Chris and Vinson. Avon then orders a second attack, carried out by Dennis \\"Cutty\\" Wise and Slim Charles, in which a Stanfield dealer named Boo is killed, and Fruit escapes after Cutty hesitates. Marlo feigns retreat, then organizes retaliatory attacks against Barksdale territory. Snoop kills the Barksdale soldier Rico in a drive-by on Poot Carr's corner. Avon responds by hiring a woman named Devonne to seduce Marlo and lure him to a meeting. Although Marlo has sex with Devonne, he grows suspicious of her. Before their next arranged meeting, he has Chris and Snoop scout the location. Chris spots an SUV responding to Devonne's presence and correctly deduces that the meeting is a setup. Chris has his driver drive up alongside the Barksdale vehicle and lets off a single shotgun blast through a side window, wounding Avon and killing another Barksdale soldier named Tater. Marlo and Chris later track down Devonne to her house, where Marlo personally kills her by shooting her once in each breast, then once in the mouth. Avon responds by ordering more attacks. An attack led by Slim Charles kills two Stanfield soldiers. When Stringer Bell is murdered, the police and drug gangs assumed that Marlo is responsible. In reality, Avon had facilitated his death by giving Brother Mouzone (and in turn Omar Little) information about Stringer's whereabouts. Marlo and Chris come close to also being murdered when Slim Charles tracks them down. However, the Major Crimes Unit, acting on a tip Stringer had given to Major Colvin, raid the Barksdale armory. Slim Charles calls for backup, but Avon and his soldiers are arrested. At the end of season 3, Avon is convicted of parole violations (and possibly a conspiracy charge). Marlo and Chris attend his sentencing hearing. Avon acknowledges Marlo, thus conceding that the crown has been passed. Season 4 Marlo begins season 4 in control of all the best territory in Western Baltimore. He ruthlessly protects his territory through Chris and Snoop, who kill off targets on Marlo's orders and hide the bodies in vacant buildings. When one of Marlo's crew chiefs, Fruit, is killed by a dealer from Bodie's gang, Marlo is quick to order the death of Lex, the dealer responsible. Marlo furthers his reputation around the neighborhood by having Monk Metcalf give away money to children during the back-to-school period. Although most children are happy to accept the money, Michael Lee notably refuses, in an early show of his strength of character. Marlo keeps his own skills and his soldiers' sharp by organizing shooting practice sessions in the woods. The Major Crimes Unit targets Marlo and begins to monitor his organization using wiretaps, but fails to link him to any murders because of the hidden bodies. They do manage to get Marlo on tape when he uses Monk's phone to talk to a subordinate known as \\"Old Face\\" Andre. When Bill Rawls puts Lt. Charles Marimow in charge of the MCU for political reasons, the investigation stalls, due to Marimow's ordering a shutdown of the money-tracing. \\"Proposition Joe\\" Stewart engineers a conflict between Marlo and Omar Little in an attempt to demonstrate the benefits of joining Joe's drug cartel: the New Day Co-Op. Stanfield agrees to join the Co- Op to learn more about Omar and the mounting police interest in his own organization. Marlo plans to have Omar framed and killed in jail. The plan fails, and Omar retaliates by stealing an entire shipment of narcotics meant for the New Day Co-Op. Marlo is suspicious of Prop Joe's claim that the shipment has been stolen and insists on some kind of satisfaction. Prop Joe agrees to set up a meeting between Marlo and his suppliers (The Greeks). Marlo meets with Spiros \\"Vondas\\" Vondopoulos and is convinced that Prop Joe was not involved in the robbery. Marlo begins having Vondas followed in order to learn more about Vondas' role in importing drugs into Baltimore. At the same time, Marlo is impressed with the teenager Michael Lee for standing up to him and believes Michael would make a good soldier. Marlo orders Chris and Snoop to recruit Michael. Michael's abusive stepfather is released from prison and Michael, believing that no one else can help him, goes to Marlo. Michael agrees to join Marlo's gang in exchange for having his stepfather killed. Marlo sets up Michael and his brother Bug in an apartment, and gives Michael his own corner, with Duquan \\"Dukie\\" Weems, and Kenard working for him. When Lester Freamon finally discovers Marlo's \\"tombs\\" in the vacant houses, a massive police investigation begins, and the re-established Major Crimes Unit begins investigating Marlo once again. Season 5 After being investigated for over a year, Marlo and his people are extremely cautious when communicating with each other. They only speak face to face and often drive all over the city in an effort to lose any tails before arriving at their meeting spot. Eventually, the Major Crimes Unit's investigation is shut down by Mayor Tommy Carcetti for economic reasons. In response, Marlo and his crew become more relaxed in their routine, convinced that they have worn the police down. Confident that he is not being watched, Marlo orders Chris and Snoop to undertake several murders. He first dispatches them to execute a drug dealer named Junebug for spreading rumors about Marlo and to attack the territory of another drug dealer named Webster Franklin, until Franklin agrees to take the Stanfield package. Marlo also orders Chris and Snoop to find and kill Omar, who has left Baltimore and retired from robbing drug dealers. Marlo quietly plans to strongarm the supply and control of the New Day Co-Op away from Prop Joe. Marlo aims to establish a direct relationship with Spiros and The Greeks' drug trafficking organization. Marlo has Chris investigate the port case at the courthouse and then bribes the former Greek soldier Sergei Malatov by depositing money into his canteen account at MCI Jessup, in order to be put on his visitor list. Marlo goes to visit Malatov, hoping to get a direct line to Vondas, but finds himself blocked by Avon. Avon states that he has no ill-will towards Marlo, and appreciates his ambition to establish Westside dominance over Proposition Joe's Co-Op. However, Avon reminds Marlo that he is still a man of formidable reputation and is considered an authority figure in the prison. He tells Marlo that all business in Jessup must go through him and demands that Marlo pay his sister $100,000 in order to gain access to Sergei. Marlo makes the payment, and Avon grants him access to Sergei. Sergei is disrespectful towards Marlo but is convinced by Avon to help Marlo reach Vondas. Marlo is directed to Little Johnny's Diner, the Greeks' headquarters. He delivers a case of money to the counterman, Andreas, and tells him to inform Vondas of his desire to meet. Marlo seeks Prop Joe's guidance in money laundering while simultaneously preparing to overthrow him. Prop Joe introduces Stanfield to a pastor who has relationships with overseas charities that he uses to launder money for a ten percent \\"donation fee\\". When Marlo meets with Vondas, Vondas is displeased that Marlo has presented him with dirty bills from the street. Marlo returns to Prop Joe to get his money cleaned. Marlo later drops off the clean money at Little Johnny's, telling the counterman to inform Vondas that he meant no disrespect. Afterwards, Marlo takes a trip to the off-shore bank in the Antilles in order to make sure his laundered money is safe. Marlo learns about Omar's confidant Butchie from Prop Joe's nephew Cheese. Marlo has Chris and Snoop torture and kill Butchie. They leave a witness to ensure word reaches Omar, but Snoop is concerned that they are provoking Omar without having any idea of how to get to him. Marlo also has Prop Joe introduce him to defense attorney Maurice Levy to assist in Marlo's money laundering. Marlo then returns to Vondas and convinces The Greek to consider him as an insurance policy should anything happen to Prop Joe. Marlo senses a growing rift between Cheese and Prop Joe, and looks to capitalize on it. After Cheese argues with a rival drug kingpin named Hungry Man at a Co-Op meeting, Marlo sees his chance. He has Chris and Snoop kidnap Hungry Man and deliver him to Cheese. Marlo asks Cheese to betray Prop Joe in exchange. Cheese leaves Prop Joe unprotected at his home, and Marlo traps him there. Marlo looks on as Chris shoots Joe in the back of the head. Marlo assumes Proposition Joe's position as The Greek's narcotics distributor in Baltimore. Marlo is given a phone, and Vondas shows him how to communicate with the Greeks without speaking; the phone is used to send pictures of clock faces that are coded to indicate meeting places. Marlo plans a visit to Atlantic City to celebrate his victory, but Chris reminds him that they must remain in hiding until Omar has been dealt with. Chris prepares to ambush Omar in Monk's apartment, but Omar escapes by leaping from the balcony. Marlo continues to use Levy to launder money and gives Levy his new cell phone number. Levy's defense investigator Thomas \\"Herc\\" Hauk copies the number after hours and passes it to Ellis Carver, ultimately resulting in Freamon's setting up an illegal wiretap. At the next Co-Op meeting Marlo informs the Co-op he was responsible for the murder of Prop Joe because he had made a move against Omar, and Omar had retaliated by killing Prop Joe. Marlo then assumes control: he appoints Cheese the head of distribution on the East Side and Monk the West Side. Marlo increases both the bounty on Omar and the cost of the product, and rules that no further group meetings will take place; instead, the members will either have to keep their problems to themselves or meet with Stanfield alone. Chris marshals his people to search for Omar, but Omar eludes them and remains a thorn in the Stanfield Organization's side. Omar then robs a money pick-up and wounds a Stanfield soldier. Omar also robs a Marlo stash house, where he kills an enforcer named Manny, and he later kills Savino Bratton. Omar calls for Marlo to face him in the streets and attacks his reputation at every opportunity, but Chris prevents this information from reaching Marlo. Omar is ultimately killed by Kenard. Omar's possessions include a list of Stanfield personnel, which is passed to Freamon and allows him to make the connection between Marlo and Cheese. Eventually, Leander Sydnor breaks the clock code, and the police are able to follow Chris to a major resupply from the Greeks using the evidence from their illegal wiretap. Monk is arrested with large quantities of drugs, and Marlo, Partlow, and Cheese are arrested for conspiracy to supply narcotics. Chris also has a murder warrant for Devar Manigault. Marlo believes that Michael Lee may be the source of information listed in the arrest warrants, as Manigault was Michael's stepfather. Marlo orders Snoop to kill Michael, but Michael realizes he is being set up and kills Snoop first. Marlo is enraged when he learns that Omar had been assaulting his street reputation and insists that when released he will re- establish his name. Levy senses that the timing of the arrests was too soon after the initial arrest of Monk and surmises that the police used illegal surveillance. Sensing the state's reluctance to take the compromised evidence to court, Levy negotiates a deal for Marlo: Marlo will go free with his charges suspended on the stet docket but will face prosecution if he returns to drug distribution. Chris will face life without the possibility of parole and will have to plead guilty to all of the vacant house murders. Monk faces a lengthy sentence on a plea bargain with no possibility of bail. Cheese is also facing a long sentence but is granted bail, so Marlo charges him to kill Michael. Marlo holds a meeting with two Co-Op members (including Fat-Face Rick and Slim Charles) from the prison and offers to sell them the connection to the Greeks for 10 million dollars, claiming that he plans to become a businessman. The Co-Op raises the funds, but Slim Charles murders Cheese in revenge for Cheese's betrayal of Proposition Joe before he can carry out Marlo's order. Fat-Face Rick and Slim Charles assume control of the connection. After Marlo's release, Levy introduces him to property developers and other prominent Baltimore businessmen at an evening event. However, Marlo quietly slips out of the event and approaches two young corner boys ‚Äì who are talking about Omar and mythologizing his death ‚Äì and provokes a fight by asking, \\"Do you know who I am?\\", the answer evidently being that they don't. One of the boys is armed with a gun and the other with a knife, but Marlo manages to drive them off. Marlo's arm is cut in the scuffle, and he is left standing alone on the corner, taking in the streets that he once ruled. Analysis Jamie Hector has commented that he sees the character as striving to obtain power rather than profit and revelling in using that power over others. The series' creator David Simon has also commented that Stanfield is driven by a desire for totalitarian power. Hector has said that much of his performance stems from trying to capture Stanfield as a man of power and economy using minimalist movement and speech. When critic Alan Sepinwall interviewed Simon about the fate of the character, Simon said he considers Stanfield's fate to be a kind of justice, as he is cut off from his power and reputation. Sepinwall hailed Stanfield's ending as defying the viewers' expectations to see the character incarcerated or murdered in the streets. Simon also commented that the ending was intended to be ironic, as Stanfield receives everything that his one-time rival Stringer Bell desired (in terms of becoming a legitimate, respected businessman) but does not value it. Simon has also said the character's ending was deliberately ambiguous. Real life origins In the mid-1980s, Timmirror Stanfield was a major Baltimore drug trafficker. In 1986, Stanfield was 25 and ran a gang which included over 50 members; the Stanfield gang controlled South Baltimore's Westport area and West Baltimore's Murphy Homes housing project. The gang committed multiple murders and drew the attention of authorities, who were able to persuade 15 witnesses to testify; the core of the gang was convicted. This real life criminal forms the basis of the character's origins while emphasizing the rise in brutality from the American heroin trade of the 1970s to the crack cocaine trade of the 1980s.

Taxonomy and systematics The number of skink species endemic to New Zealand is not yet known, as advancing molecular studies indicate genetic divergence amongst many groups previously considered a single species. At present, there is estimated to be between 50-60 species, all of the family Scincidae.New Zealand Herpetological Society. (2014). NZ Reptiles. Retrieved from Following a taxonomic revision of the species complex in 2008, the copper skink was assigned the scientific name of Cyclodina aenea, and found to be both genetically and morphologically diverged from two other skink species that were previously considered synonymic. Anatomy The copper skink is New Zealand's smallest indigenous skink, with a mature length of no more than 120mm. Like most skinks, it has smooth skin covering a long body, with relatively short legs. The tail makes up a considerable proportion of the body length, and tapers to a point. The skink is capable of shedding its tail to distract predators when threatened, before regenerating a new one ‚Äì a process known as caudal autotomy. Copper skinks have small heads with round, lidded eyes, which they are capable of blinking. Ecology and behaviour The copper skink occupies a range of habitats, from forested areas to urban gardens. Like many skinks, it has a largely carnivorous diet and feeds mostly on small insects and other invertebrates. Copper skinks are viviparous, and mate in spring before giving birth to between 3-7 relatively large offspring in late summer.Gill, B. and T. Whitaker. 2001. New Zealand Frogs and Reptiles. David Bateman. Auckland, New Zealand. Distribution The initial arrival of the copper skink (and indeed any other skink species) to New Zealand is somewhat uncertain, and is a topic of considerable debate. The level of genetic diversity between the copper skink and other indigenous species suggests strongly that they and their ancestors have been a part of New Zealand's fauna for millions of years, allowing time for many early species to diverge and become distinct from each other. One 2009 study by Chapple, Ritchie and Daugherty, investigating ‚Äúthe origin and diversification‚Äù of New Zealand's skinks, produced a molecular phylogeny by analysing genetic sequences of all but one living species. It suggested that all indigenous New Zealand skinks form a monophyletic group with a single ancestor, and that they initially arrived during the early Miocene era, by clinging to floating debris from New Caledonia. From this early colonisation they underwent adaptive radiation to fill a variety of ecological niches, spreading across New Zealand to form the numerous species known today. Conservation Despite the dramatic alteration of New Zealand's landscape by humans, the copper skink has adapted relatively well to urbanisation of its environment. In 2012 the Department of Conservation (DOC) classified the copper skink as Not Threatened under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. It is a common sight in many Auckland gardens, due to its ability to thrive in a range of microhabitats. In the early 1980s (when this species had unprotected status) about a dozen adult Copper Skinks were captured in a park in Tauranga and released in the Lynmore suburb of Rotorua where there was no natural population. Despite a large cat population the descendants of these relocated Copper Skinks are still present with juveniles regularly found at the original release site (2018). This demonstrates that relocations of this species into urban gardens can be successful. However, introduced mammalian predators such as cats, rodents and hedgehogs have proven to reduce their population numbers in many regions. In addition to the threat of mammalian predators, there are concerns that the competition for resources between the copper skink and the introduced rainbow skink (Lampropholis delicata) may present a further threat to copper skink populations.Department of Conservation. (n.d). Rainbow Skinks. Retrieved from A prolific breeder, the rainbow skink occupies a very similar niche to the copper skink in terms of habitat and diet, indicating a significant competition between the species. Despite the concern, there has been relatively little research conducted into the potential effects of rainbow skinks in New Zealand. One 2004 study did compare the condition of captive copper and rainbow skinks housed together with those housed separately, and did not find significant difference between the two. However, due to the high overlap of the species‚Äô resource requirements, the rainbow skink is still considered by many to be a potential threat to copper skink populations.

Produced by The Mofo Video Corp. and released by Lorimar Home Video, the tape features seven different swindles or tricks that the home viewer can use to fool their friends. The tape was a companion piece to their best-selling book of the same name, released two years later. All of the tricks involve using a portion of the videotape. Tape format The tape begins with an odd warning after the usual FBI anti- piracy warning and Lorimar Home Video opening logo: Penn & Teller assume no responsibility for the misuse of these materials and will not be held liable to anyone who loses money from the illegal misuse of this tape. After, Penn & Teller introduce themselves, making a huge point about how there are roughly 137.999 suckers to every American who owns a VCR (and can thus buy and use the tape). Some of the music in the tape is incidental background music provided by Penn & Teller themselves (Penn on bass guitar, Teller on keyboard). There is also a video of \\"The Act of Being Polite\\" by The Residents. They also filmed the tape almost exclusively in the apartment of co-writer Eddie Gorodetsky. This was supposedly to help reduce the cost of the tape, which, Penn jokingly suggests retailed at $3.95. The scams The card force (no name given) The opening trick involved learning a simple effect called a card force. The trick involved distracting the victim and forcing them to select the three of clubs from a deck of cards. The magician asks them to make a simple wager on the outcome, and intentionally picks the wrong card from the deck. After doing so the magician asks the victim to watch some TV. When the TV is turned on, the videotape shows a clip from the old Carole Lombard movie Nothing Sacred. After a TV bumper, a quick segment called \\"Newsbreak\\" comes on. The female newsreader reads a news piece about a new government scandal. After reading a few lines, the newsreader is given a breaking headline. She pauses, smiles brightly, holds up a jumbo-sized three of clubs and says \\"Is this your card?\\" The magician is then supposed to take the money and laugh at his victim. Super Kleener This trick does not involve cards, but instead involves the user to have paper towels and a bottle of glass cleaner. The tape also included a sticker which reads \\"Static Free for TV Screens\\" to place on the bottle. The Magician is supposed to start to watch another clip from Nothing Sacred when the Magician is supposed to act like they see a speck of dirt on the screen. The Magician is then supposed to spray some of the cleaner on a paper towel and after a special moment happens in the movie the magician starts rubbing the screen with the paper towel. The clip has been digitally altered to look like the image is being torn and distorted like, as Penn puts it, \\"a watercolor being rubbed with a wet sponge.\\" The victim is supposed to be shocked into thinking that an over-the-counter cleanser can actually damage an image on a TV screen. This is not to be done for money, but just for laughs. This trick was demonstrated on an episode of Late Night with David Letterman. Demon from Hell Said to be Penn's favorite clip, this trick makes fun of the then-popular claim by Fundamentalist Christians that many popular albums, movies, and TV shows contained backwards messages (referred to as backmasking). Penn says \\"this is obviously hysterical grandstanding. Use your head! If backwards masking really worked, Ozzy Osbourne would be the Prime Minister of England!\\" The magician is then asked to claim that he has found a backwards masking technique in a show hosted by an unnamed Televangelist. The victim is asked to put some money on it. The magician pauses the tape, and then is supposed to pretend to play the film backwards. In actuality the Magician just presses the \\"play\\" button. The footage starts to play in reverse. The preacher starts to say all manner of Satanic messages such as \\"Satan is our Lord\\" and \\"The screams of torture are the music of my dance\\". This trick was done to seemingly poke fun at televangelists like Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart. Vidi-Kopy In \\"Vidi-Kopy\\", Penn & Teller claim they have created an experimental tape that can turn a VCR into a digital copier. After a short description, the Magician starts the tape with what appears to be a computer screen placed on it. The Magician prepares a \\"random piece of paper.\\" A female voice says \\"Do not touch screen during Vidi-Kopy operation.\\" After a few seconds of digital flashing, a copy of the image drawn on the paper appears on the screen. After a fake \\"save\\" function, the Magician is then asked to take a dollar bill out of his pocket, and hold it against the screen and an image of the bill appears on the screen, then the magician presses a fake button on the screen which makes the image magnify on the screen. The Magician then has two options, either turn off the tape and then attempt to sell the fake Vidi-Kopy tape to the victim, or keep the tape rolling for the punch-line. The Magician is supposed to downplay the warnings about touching the screen and place his bare hand on the screen and press the copy button. The image flashes and a copy of his hand is supposed to appear on the screen, which flashes violently, the female voice starts saying \\"System Failure.\\" The Magician, as soon as it flashes (but before the hand is visible on-screen), is supposed to scream and act like his hand had been horribly burned. Diamond and the Dope This clip requires a deck of cards and an X-Acto knife. Before your friend comes over, you are supposed to take the five of diamonds and carefully cut out the middle diamond with the knife, then you place the doctored card into the deck. You tell your friend that Penn & Teller are going to be on TV with MTV VJ Alan Hunter. Then you tell your friend that he will be the Magician for an interactive card trick. Penn will ask the person who is in on it to pull out a card and examine it and place it back into the deck. It doesn't matter what card you pick, you say it was the four of diamonds. The victim is then asked to place the deck on top of the TV. Teller then \\"reaches\\" up and pulls down a similarly gimmicked card. Penn says \\"Is this your card, the FIVE of diamonds?\\" The person says no, then Teller (who has been wearing a red and white striped tie) moves the hole onto a white stripe, this making the red diamond vanish, and thus correctly finding the chosen card. The victim will be amazed that the trick has gone off so well. The person who is in on it is supposed to say that he thinks he knows how the trick was done and asks for the card...he pulls out the gimmicked card which has now magically appeared in the deck. Penn says that there are three separate betting points, but does not say what they are. Beginner's luck? This trick is supposed to be used on either people who are too cheap to buy their own copy of the tape, or too sophisticated to fall for the more outrageous scams. The bit will revolve around a fake magic tutorial jokingly titled \\"Cool Tricks for Dear Friends\\". Penn & Teller will show the victim and the magician how to do a simple trick involving three cards. The idea is to take three playing cards, fan them out and then flipping over the middle card so the fan shows up front, back, front. Penn will then give some bogus instructions to a trick that involves flipping the middle card over in order to make all three backs show in a row. The victim will have trouble with the trick, while the Magician will nail it on the first go. This is because the Magician has made a gaffed double-backed card by using a glue stick to stick two cards together, so only the backs are showing. Penn says to milk this trick, you are supposed to act patronizing and condescending to your victim, (in the video, Penn & Teller claim that they have taught the trick to handicapped children and that they have learned it straight-away.) Wedge of Greed The last trick on the tape is said to be Teller's favorite. The trick is a mentalism trick that is to be performed with a sucker who has a girlfriend (played here by Lydia Lunch) you would like to have all your own. In the trick you set up by saying that when a couple starts going together, a mental bond (or simpatico) is created that is said to \\"borderline on eerie.\\" To prove this, The magician asks both people to stand back to back, with the woman staring at the TV, which is playing yet another clip of Nothing Sacred. The magician pulls out a randomly picked book and asks the victim to pick a page at random, and then he asks the victim to tell him how many lines down to go on the page and how many word across in order to pick a random word. This word is written down on a card and handed to the victim, who is goaded into betting his money that his girlfriend CAN'T guess the word by concentrating. This drives a wedge between the victim and his lover...who magically knows that the word is \\"bundle.\\" This is because the magician doesn't use the word picked out of the book, he writes down the word \\"bundle\\" and hands it to the victim. While this is going on, the woman is watching the TV, when over the clip, Teller walks in holding up large cue cards which say that the word is \\"bundle.\\" Epilogue After the last trick footage is shown, the tape ends with Penn and Teller at the beach, thanking the viewer and saying goodbye. It is stated more or less directly that those who purchased the tape intending to scam their friends are the true suckers. This was overtly foreshadowed during the explanation of the card force scam: \\"...that's why we made this tape. It's wrong to gloat, and evildoers must be punished.\\" This matches the \\"trick/punchline\\" format of each trick, with the tape as a whole being a large trick on the buyer, and this segment the punchline to that trick. Quotes Penn: \\"There are 5,380,000,000 people in this world. 4.71% of these live in the United States. Of those living in the United States, 60.83% own televisions. And of those owning televisions, only 27% own video recorders. That makes 38,705,057 of US, and 5,341,294,943 of THEM. That's 137.999 suckers for each one of us. *cash register sfx* Sucker-wise, it's an embarrassment of riches. If you follow our instructions closely, and have the money to fund your betting, you're gonna make money off us. Even if you paid as much as the full, list, retail price of $3.95 for this tape, you're gonna increase your money by an order of magnitude in less time than it takes to say 'knowing falsification of advertising claims resulting in irretrievable financial loss by the aggrieved party.'\\" Penn: (referring to \\"Vidi-Kopy\\") \\"You're smart enough to see the implications...there's money to be made here.

The team ceased operations at the end of 2008, with Walkinshaw Racing and Kelly Racing being formed by owners and staff of the former team. The team is best known for winning the Bathurst 1000 in 2003 and 2004 and the V8 Supercars championship in 2006 and 2007. History K-Mart Racing Team The team was formed in 2001 as K-Mart Racing Team when Tom Walkinshaw Racing expanded its Holden Racing Team operation to four cars. Because a team could only race three cars under a Racing Entitlement Contract (REC), Romano Racing's REC was leased for the two K-Mart cars with the Romano car entered as a third Holden Racing Team car under the Holden Young Lions banner. Todd Kelly who had driven a third HRT entry under the Holden Young Lions banner in 2000 drove one car, with the second driven by Greg Murphy who moved with the K-Mart sponsorship from Gibson Motorsport. The team achieved its first success in winning the final two rounds of the 2001 season. Murphy won his home event, the V8 International at Pukekohe Park Raceway, which was followed by Kelly winning the V8 Ultimate at Sandown Raceway, his first championship round win. Murphy would go on to win the Pukekohe event again for the team in 2002 and 2003. For 2003 the cars were entered under a REC leased from John Faulkner Racing with Rick Kelly replacing brother Todd. Following the February 2003 collapse of Tom Walkinshaw Racing, the team was purchased by Holden before being quickly on-sold to John and Margaret Kelly, the parents of Rick and Todd. In July 2003 the leased John Faulkner REC was returned (and subsequently sold to Paul Weel Racing), after one was purchased from 00 Motorsport. =Bathurst success= Rick Kelly at Hidden Valley Raceway in June 2007 The team won both the 2003 and 2004 Bathurst 1000 with Murphy and Rick Kelly as co-drivers. This included being a part of one of the most famous moments in Bathurst history in 2003, with Murphy setting what became known as the 'Lap of the Gods' in the Top 10 Shootout. The lap was the fastest in circuit history at the time. In winning the 2003 race, Rick Kelly became the youngest winner in the race's history. HSV Dealer Team Paul Dumbrell at Queensland Raceway in July 2008 In 2005 Murphy was replaced by Garth Tander. At this point K-Mart concluded their sponsorship and the team became the HSV Dealer Team. Rick Kelly's entry was, however, rebranded as Team Buick for the V8 Supercars China Round. The team struggled through the early stages of 2005 before a late upturn in form. In 2006, Toll Group joined HSV as a title sponsor with the team becoming known as Toll HSV Dealer Team. The team then quickly became the dominant force of the championship with Rick Kelly winning the 2006 championship title and Tander doing likewise in 2007. In 2008 Tander transferred, with the Toll sponsorship, to the Holden Racing Team and was replaced by Paul Dumbrell. As well as continuing HSV sponsorship, the team ran Autobarn colours for Dumbrell and Opes Prime colours for Kelly, Toll Group then rejoined the team to replace Opes Prime for the remainder of the 2008 season, following the collapse of Opes Prime. Rick Kelly won the team's final race at Oran Park Raceway in December 2008, which was also the final championship race held at the now- demolished circuit. =2006 co-driver swap= For the endurance races in 2006, the HSV Dealer Team and the Holden Racing Team swapped drivers, primarily to split Tander and Kelly who were both in contention for the championship (being 1st and 2nd at that point). Tander joined Mark Skaife at HRT while Todd Kelly rejoined the team. A loophole in the regulations allowed the drivers to terminate their contracts with their respective teams. However while Kelly would finish second at both Sandown and Bathurst, Tander only managed twenty-seventh at Sandown and did not finish at Bathurst. The loophole was later closed. Demise and legacy At the end of 2008 John Kelly announced he would end his association with Walkinshaw Performance and establish Kelly Racing, with preparation handled by Perkins Engineering. The new team expanded to four cars and featured both Kelly brothers driving in the same team for the first time. The team continues to this day, and partnered with Nissan for their return to the category in 2013. Walkinshaw Performance decided to continue to race four cars, forming Walkinshaw Racing in 2009 to complement the HRT entries. Dumbrell remained with the Walkinshaw operation for 2009, joined by former HSV Dealer Team endurance co-driver David Reynolds. Walkinshaw Racing folded after the 2015 season as the operation downsized to two cars.

Several of its members, including Emma Bull and best-selling author Steven Brust, are better known as writers of fantasy and science fiction. The group released two studio albums and remained active through the early 1990s. After a hiatus of two decades, a reunion concert took place in April 2015, later released as the live double CD A Long Time Gone (2016), with a concert DVD released under the same title. Personnel The original members of the group were Steven Brust on drums, Emma Bull on lead vocals, Bill Colsher on guitar and synthesizer, Lojo Russo on bass and vocals, and Adam Stemple on guitar and vocals. For the group's 2015 reunion, Colsher was replaced by Scott Keever, performing on guitar, mandolin, and keyboards. Both Brust and Bull are best known as professional authors of fantasy and science fiction novels. Stemple, a professional musician, is also the author of several fantasy novels, including two series of books for young readers co- authored with his mother, the fantasy writer and editor Jane Yolen. Cats Laughing (1988) In 1988, Cats Laughing released their debut album, self- titled but also known as Bootleg Issue, initially on cassette and CD. The first album was later reissued and distributed under the titles The Basement Tape and Reissue. It was re-released digitally in 2013 under the title The First Album. Under the title 2016 Re-Reissue, a digitally remastered version was released on CD in March 2016. Its cover art was designed to give the appearance of a cassette insert from Reissue, with the handwritten addition of \\"2016 Re-\\" before the previous title. Production notes The album was recorded on a four-track recorder, with effects created using guitar stomp boxes and a home stereo equalizer. The track \\"Signal to Noise\\" was initially listed as three tracks, with its introductory section broken out under the title \\"FMera\\", and the ending section broken out under the title \\"FMera (reprise).\\" The noise that starts \\"FMera\\" (or \\"Signal to Noise\\") was Adam Stemple striking a match close to the microphone. The concluding songs of the album were further described by Emma Bull: > Since the first CD was made from the original cassette, where there were no > electronic markers for the beginnings and ends of songs, things can get > kinda hairy. But here‚Äôs the Official Conception: \\"Back Door\\" ends. Then the > strange ambient noise-jam starts up that we developed, when playing live, to > suggest a radio being tuned across a series of frequencies that weren‚Äôt > coming in well enough to identify‚Äîsort of a \\"driving across the middle of > nowhere late at night and getting things on your radio that might be signals > from outer space\\" feel. That‚Äôs \\"FMera\\" (which we didn‚Äôt name until we > recorded it), which is really just the intro to \\"Signal to Noise.\\" Since we > were way into structure, we had to go out as we came in, so \\"Signal to > Noise\\" ends with more space-jam noise, which is \\"FMera (reprise)\\". The album > ends in a mighty doom-and-gloom crash with \\"More Thumbscrews,\\" the song that > starts with the lyrics, \\"The trees bowed to greet me as I passed by.\\" Track listing Another Way to Travel (1990) The group's second album, Another Way to Travel, was released in 1990 with ten original songs, and an arrangement of the traditional song \\"Nottamun Town.\\" Production notes The song \\"Black Knight's Work\\" was co-written by Emma Bull and another science fiction and fantasy writer, John M. Ford. Dave Stenshoel (fiddle) and Robin Anders (additional percussion), both members of the band Boiled in Lead, appeared on Another Way to Travel as guest musicians. The album featured cover art by editor and author Terri Windling, depicting the band members and a vehicle known as the Catmobile that was used to transport the band. The vehicle, owned by Brust, was a Cadillac ambulance that had been painted yellow, light blue, and dark blue, with murals. Critical reception According to AllMusic reviewer Richard Foss, \\"The original tunes on Another Way to Travel are as inventive as might be expected of a band with two highly original poets and novelists aboard... it's hard to listen to this disc without a pang of regret that Cats Laughing didn't stay together a while longer and record a few more albums.\\" Foss pointed to the album's \\"sophisticated, complex arrangements of all sorts of music\\", bringing \\"a sense of character and purpose\\" that spanned multiple genres. Track listing Musical career in the mid-1990s As Cats Laughing became increasingly less active in the 1990s, Emma Bull also played in folk duo The Flash Girls, while Stemple was one of the lead singers and a guitarist for the folk celtic punk band Boiled in Lead. Russo switched from bass to mandolin to play in the Irish band Gallowglass, then began a solo career in 1993. The group occasionally reunited as late as the mid-1990s. In 1994, two Cats Laughing songs were included in the soundtrack of a video, an extended promotional trailer for a potential film production based on Emma Bull's screenplay for her novel War for the Oaks (1987). In addition to the two full-length songs, the trailer also opened with the introduction to \\"Signal to Noise\\" (also known as \\"FMera\\") from The Bootleg Issue. The video was shot on location in Minneapolis by Will Shetterly, and included \\"Nottamun Town\\" and a new Cats Laughing song, \\"Here We Go Again,\\" that was based on War for the Oaks. The full eleven-minute trailer was published at Green Man Review. Excerpts from the trailer that included \\"Here We Go Again\\" and \\"Nottamun Town\\" were later self-released in higher resolution by Shetterly. A Long Time Gone (2016) 2015 reunion concerts Emma Bull and Lojo Russo at reunion concert A reunion concert by Cats Laughing took place on April 3, 2015, at the Minicon 50 science fiction convention in Bloomington, Minnesota. The Minnesota Science Fiction Society hosted a two-hour concert on the convention's opening Friday night. An additional reunion concert was held in Minneapolis at the Phoenix Theater on August 26, 2015. The reunited group included Steven Brust, Emma Bull, Lojo Russo, and Minicon 50's musician guest of honor, Adam Stemple. Bill Colsher declined to participate publicly, but remained engaged in plans associated with the reunion. The group took on a new member, Scott Keever, on guitar, mandolin, and keyboards. Production notes The reunion project, including live video streaming of the concert and production of a concert CD and DVD, was fully funded in January 2015 by a Kickstarter campaign. The additional reunion concert in August 2015 was held specifically so that it could be recorded for the release, in light of issues with audio recording of the earlier performance. In March 2016, Cats Laughing released a live double CD of the 2015 reunion concert, A Long Time Gone, as well as a DVD by the same title with documentary concert footage.

It covers an area of 608 hectares and is located 750m above sea level. The following villages border Rachaf : Srobbine - Debel - Al Tiri - Haddatha - Beit Leif. It can be reached by several routes, such as the following : Sour - Aain Baal - Qana - Siddiqine - Kafra - Hariss - Haddatha - Rachaf History In 1596, it was named as a village, ar-Rasaf, in the Ottoman nahiya (subdistrict) of Tibnin under the liwa' (district) of Safad, with a population of 51 households, all Muslim.

During the winter, the number of residents is approximately 300, a number which increases to 1,500 during summer. The low number of residents is because Rachaf was under Israeli occupation, which forced most of the residents to immigrate to the southern suburbs of Beirut and Sour, Aaitit, Al Rmadiyeh, Al Sarafand and Al Bazouriyeh. Despite the Israeli retreat in year 2000, migrants did not return to their village. However, the village has witnessed some renewed construction activities, with 200 additional houses built. There are 250 houses in the village distributed across 12 quarters: El Dayaa - Al Saha, Al Bayyad, Khalet El Maghara, Sahlet El Zaitoun, Al Rou√©s, Al Dabsh Al Sharky, Al Dabsh Al Gharby, Al Assi, Al Maabour, Aain Jdeidah, Al Sowan, and Al Aaqaba.  Voters  The number of registered voters May 2004 was 1,690 (832 males and 858 females) compared to 1,505 voters in 2000, distributed mainly between 24 families.  Local Authorities  The village has a municipal council composed of 12 members. It was recently founded, based on the decision of the Minister of Interior and Municipalities no. 8 dated January 13, 2004. Rachaf has two mayors, one residing in the village and the other residing in Beirut southern suburb. The revenues that the municipality received from the independent municipal council in 2002 stood at LBP 115 million.  Educational and social institutions  The village has one primary public school with 26 registered students as of October 2004 - 9 in kindergarten and 17 in primary cycle. The school has 5 teachers. The total number of students in Rachaf is about 50, most of them registered in schools in Kafra and Bint Jbeil.  Economic Activities  The cultivated area constitutes only 5.6% of total land, while the arable land reaches 37% of the total area. The main products cultivated are olives, grains and tobacco. The Lebanese Reggie for Tobacco and Tombacs buys the entire tobacco production of the 22 farmers in the village. Oil, grains and other agricultural goods (tomatoes, cantaloupes, etc.) produced are sold in the village. Moreover, the production of honey is estimated at 500 kg, which is sold inside the village at LBP 20,000-30,000/kilo.  Problems  The major problem in Rachaf is the emigration to other towns and cities. Furthermore, the village lacks a sewage system, which forces the residents to use cesspools. The poor health services due to the lack of dispensaries in the village forces the villagers to go to the dispensaries and hospitals located outside the village such as Tebnin Governmental Hospital (8 km away) or Salah Ghandour Hospital (7 km away).

(Cantor has Dinah Shore under contract, and the only way they could get him to agree to her appearance was by making him Chairman of the benefit committee.) Meanwhile, an aspiring singer (Dennis Morgan) and his songwriter girlfriend (Joan Leslie) conspire to get into the charity program by replacing Cantor with their look-alike friend, tour bus driver Joe Simpson (also played by Eddie Cantor). Many of Warner Brothers's stars performed in musical numbers, including several who were not known as singers. The show features the only screen musical performances by Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, and Ida Lupino.

The film utilized sets which had been built for the Warner Bros. films The Green Pastures and Wonder Bar. Thank Your Lucky Stars was the film debut of both Dinah Shore and Spike Jones and his City Slickers. Each of the cast members was paid a $50,000 fee for their appearance which was then donated to the Hollywood Canteen.Spada 1993, p. 194. Bette Davis recalled Wiedell‚Äîwho had really won a jitterbug contest‚Äîwas frightened at the thought of hurting her. \\"...forget about who I am...let your instincts come to the fore, and just do it!\\" she said. Olivia de Havilland said that she added the over-the-top gum chewing to the act in order to help with the lip-synching. This was Dinah Shore's screen debut, and she was a huge hit with the critics. The finale was filmed with many of the cast on stage together, but everyone is there when the curtain comes down, thanks to special effects that place five acts‚Äî Errol Flynn, Ann Sheridan, Bette Davis, Carson and Hale; and the trio of de Havilland, Lupino and Tobias‚Äî over their glitter- covered stars. Reception Thank Your Lucky Stars was popular with audiences, and the critic James Agee called it \\"the loudest and most vulgar of the current musicals. It is also the most fun.\\"Ringgold and Quirk 1966, p. 123. Ticket sales combined with the donated salaries of the performers raised more than two million dollars for the Hollywood Canteen.Spada 1993, p. 195. The film earned $2,503,000 domestically and $1,118,000 foreign. At the time, Variety described it as a ‚Äútriumph for Eddie Cantor‚Äù. The New York Times' Bosley Crowther, on the other hand, observed that ‚Äú the gag that the true Mr. Cantor would, if he could, gum up the show is so realistically repeated that fiction becomes painful fact.‚Äù Putting aside the plot device, ‚Äúyou have a conventional all-star show which has the suspicious flavor of an 'amateur night' at the studio. But at least it is lively and genial... For the sake of variety, the Warners might have worked in a little more dance and a little more femininity. Too many people sing. And too few beautiful girls display their talents. It is also too much (two hours) of a show. But, in straight omnibus entertainment that's what you have to expect.‚Äù Leonard Maltin gives the picture three out of four stars, noting: ‚ÄúVery lame plot... frames all- star Warner Bros. show, with Davis singing \\"They're Either Too Young or Too Old, Flynn delightfully performing \\"That's What You Jolly Well Get, other staid stars breaking loose.‚Äù Awards and honors The song \\"They're Either Too Young or Too Old\\" by Arthur Schwartz (music) and Frank Loesser (lyrics) was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Music, Original Song, but lost to \\"You'll Never Know\\" by Harry Warren and Mack Gordon from the film, Hello, Frisco, Hello.

The work laments the death of two of the poet's sons, Gunnar, who died of a fever, and B√∂√∞varr, who drowned during a storm. It is preserved in a few manuscripts of Egils saga Skalla-Gr√≠mssonar, ch. 78. According to the saga, after Egill placed B√∂√∞varr in the family burial mound, he locked himself in his bed-chamber, determined to starve himself to death. Egill‚Äôs daughter Thorgerd diverted him from this plan in part by convincing him to compose a memorial poem for B√∂√∞varr, to be carved on a rune- staff. Manuscripts The first stanza of the poem is attested in all the main medieval manuscripts of the saga (or, where these are now incomplete, in copies made when they were more complete): * M√∂√∞ruvallab√≥k (Reykjav√≠k, Stofnun √Årna Magn√∫ssonar, AM 132 fol) * Die Herzog August Bibliothek in Wolfenb√ºttel (9. 10. Aug. 4to). This MS has a lacuna at this point, but some copies include this stanza. * The lost manuscript known as 'K' represented by two nearly identical copies by Ketill J√∂rundsson, AM 453 and 462 4to. Only the K-manuscripts have the whole poem. However, the first half of st. 23 and the whole of st. 24 also appears in Snorra Edda. According to Bjarni Einarsson, 'the text of the poem is the result of a long series of copies and is in some instances corrupt beyond correction'.Egils saga, ed. by Bjarni Einarsson (London: Viking Society for Northern Research, 2003), p. 146 n. 1, http://www.vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/Egla/Egils_saga.pdf. Form and content of the poem Sonnatorrek is composed in kvi√∞uh√°ttr, a relatively undemanding meter which Egill also employed in his praise-poem, Arinbjarnarkvi√∞a. Kvi√∞uh√°ttr is a variant of the usual eddaic metre fornyr√∞islag, in which the odd lines have only three metrical positions instead of the usual four (i.e. they are catalectic), but the even lines function as usual. As in fornyr√∞islag, there is systematic alliteration but no rhyme.Kari Ellen Gade, 'Introduction', in Poetry from the Kings' Sagas 2, ed. by Kari Ellen Gade, Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages, 2, 2 vols (Turnhout: Brepols, 2009), i-cvii (p. c), https://www.abdn.ac.uk/skaldic/m.php?p=doconw&i;=624. Thus the first stanza, as edited by Finnur J√≥nsson,Finnur J√≥nsson (ed.), Den norsk-islandske skjaldedigtning, 4 vols (Copenhagen: Gyldendal, 1912‚Äì15), B.i, 34. reads :: Mj«´k erum tregt :: tungu at hr≈ìra :: me√∞ loptv√¶tt :: lj√≥√∞pundara; :: esa n√∫ v√¶nligt :: of Vi√∞urs √æ√Ωfi, :: n√© h√≥gdr≈ìgt :: √≥r hugar fylgsni. Sonatorrek‚Äôs 25 stanzas progress through seven stages:Following E.O.G. Turville-Petre, Scaldic Poetry (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1976; ), pp. 24-25. * st. 1-4: Egill struggles to find words to express his grief; he laments the end of his family line. The fourth stanza introduces the imagery of wood and trees representing the family that is maintained throughout the poem. * st. 5: The poet recalls the death of his parents. * st. 5-12: Egill relates his grief over B√∂√∞varr‚Äôs death; using the image of the sea breaking a cruel gap in the ‚Äúfence of his kinsmen‚Äù (fr√¶ndgar√∞r).Lee M. Hollander (1936), p.7. The poet would like to take vengeance on the sea-deities √Ügir and R√°n, but as an old man without followers he is helpless against them. * st. 13-19: The death of Egill‚Äôs older brother, Th√≥r√≥lfr, is now recalled. Since Th√≥r√≥lfr fell, Egill has grown lonely and lacks support in combat. * st. 20-21: The poet briefly recalls Gunnar, his first son, who died of a fever. * st. 22-24: Egill now turns on √ì√∞inn, with whom he had been on good terms until the god broke their friendship. Yet on reflection, the poet recognizes that √ì√∞inn has given him two gifts in compensation for the two sons he has taken: the craft of poetry and the ability to turn deceivers into open enemies. * st. 25: Finally, Egill reconciles himself to his loss, awaiting death with tranquility. Elements of pre-Christian belief Sonatorrek provides an unusually personal expression of Norse paganism. The poem includes some 20 allusions to Norse gods and myths, not all of which can be understood. The poem deals with Egil's complicated relationship with √ì√∞inn, as well as those with R√°n and √Ügir. The poet‚Äôs personification of inevitable death as the goddess Hel waiting on a headland (st. 25) is particularly striking. It has been suggested that Egill modeled Sonatorrek and his expressions of grief on the myth of √ì√∞inn grieving for his own dead son, Baldr.Harris (2006), pp. 158-59; Harris (1994), p.174; North (1990), pp. 158-59. Sonatorrek‚Äôs status as literature Sonatorrek is ‚Äúgenerally regarded as the first purely subjective lyric in the North,‚ÄùPeter Hallberg, Old Icelandic Poetry: Eddic Lay and Skaldic Verse (Lincoln: Univ. Nebraska Press, 1962; ), p.136. and has been called ‚Äúa poem of unparalleled psychological depth, poetic self-awareness and verbal complexity.‚ÄùLarrington (1992), pp. 62-63. Several commentators have compared Sonatorrek to a theme from Goethe.Peter Hallberg, Ibid., p. 140; see also sources cited in K. S. Heslop (2000), p.152. In Scandinavian letters, it is often regarded as the very birth of subjective poetic utterance within the native culture (Old Norse literature being seen as a common Nordic heritage).

Though still standing, it is closed to traffic and was replaced by the Sartell Bridge constructed about 850 feet downstream. The bridge is around 1000 feet downstream of the Sartell Dam. The bridge was built during a six-month period in 1914, but over the years the bridge became congested and less able to carry heavy traffic. As early as 1957, heavy trucks were found to be too much for the span. When the new bridge was built in 1984, the old bridge was used as a pedestrian footbridge, but it became impractical for this use since there was a factory at the east end. The bridge now carries only utility lines. The Old Sartell Bridge is a three span pin connected camelback through truss. The camelback design is a specific type of Parker truss, where the polygonal top chord is composed of exactly five sections. Each span of the Old Sartell Bridge is composed of six panels.

She was played by Rachael Lindsay. Sammy first appeared in 1987 when, along with her family - mother Chrissy, father Frank , younger brother Geoff and younger sister Katie she moved to No.7. At the time, she was 14 years old and a pupil at Brookside Comprehensive School. Determined to be independent, Sammy was keen to find a part-time job, and following an abortive attempt at cleaning for Harry Cross and Ralph Hardwick, she found an after-school job in a local supermarket, where she struck up a friendship with co-worker and fellow student Nisha Batra. She also developed an interest in animal rights, becoming a vegetarian and joining a local campaign group. Despite her parents' initial misgivings, they eventually rallied round, allowing her to join her campaign group on a national demonstration in London, and - following the family's move to No.5 - by experimenting with organic gardening. During this time, she was pursued by local boy Owen Daniels, and they began dating in spring of 1989. A significant ongoing storyline for Sammy, Owen and Nisha came in October 1989, when, following a night out with a group of friends, they were involved in a serious car accident which killed the driver of their car (a young man whom one of their friends had just met in a nightclub). Sammy survived the incident with a broken arm, concussion and cuts and bruising and was released from hospital after a few days; however Owen remained in a coma for several weeks, during which time Sammy visited him regularly at the hospital. At the inquest some months later, it emerged that all the girls except Sammy had been somewhat economical with the truth in order to spare the feelings of the deceased's parents. Sammy progressed to the Sixth Form of Brookside Comprehensive shortly after the accident, however she struggled to cope in the aftermath of the accident and turned to alcohol for a period. After struggling with her studies, she left school part-way through her course and enrolled on a hotel management course. With her relationship with Owen having faded in the wake of his injuries and her alcoholism, she began a relationship with a much older man, Tim Darby - who had a daughter close to Sammy's age. However, the relationship did not last, and she reunited with Owen and soon fell pregnant. They married on the 6 November 1991. Sammy gave birth to daughter Louise on 5 June 1992. after the birth of Louise, Sammy suffered severe post-natal depression which resulted in her shaking the child. once Owen caught her trying to drown Louise in the bathtub. The pressure becoming too much for her, Sammy took Louise back to the hospital leaving her in the car park. Social Services became involved, and Owen, fearing for his daughter's safety, took her to live with his parents for a while before eventually reconciling with Sammy and moving out of no. 5 to live in their own flat. She left the close the following year, only to return soon afterwards for her father's wedding to Lyn Matthews. However, on the way to the wedding reception, Frank was involved in a car crash and died shortly afterwards, while his passenger Tony Dixon was in a coma for three months before dying. Jimmy Corkhill later confessed he was responsible for causing the crash. She left the close again soon after her father's death. Sammy made a comeback for several months in 1996, when she was involved in a court case. Whilst on a night out at la luz, Sammy meets noel stones, who invites her on holiday to Tenerife. She had lied to him telling him she had no children, passing Louise off as Katie's child. she decided to go on the holiday, leaving a note for Katie asking her to look after Louise. Unfortunately Katie had agreed to travel down to Birmingham where Jacqui Dixon was involved in a hair show, and did not see the note Sammy left her. She was arrested at the airport. Eventually she was cleared, but left the show in September 1996. She returned as a semi-regular character in 2001 and on a more regular basis throughout 2002, although by now the show's ratings were in steep decline and its demise was being widely speculated in the media, a stark contrast to Sammy's original spell in the show when it pulled in millions of viewers for three episodes a week, and by late 2002 it was only being aired once a week. She made a final brief comeback in the autumn of 2003, weeks before the last episode of Brookside was aired.

This Somerset Wildlife Trust reserve, which is about north-west of Langport and south-east of Bridgwater, consists of large blocks of semi- natural ancient woodland along the west-facing slope of Aller Hill, overlooking King's Sedgemoor. The reserve is about 40 ha (99 acres) and the underlying geology of most of it is Lias limestone. Prior to the twentieth century it appears to have been managed for centuries as traditional coppice woodlandd. Aller and Beer Woods are outstanding examples of ancient, escarpment woodland managed in a traditional coppice-with-standards system. The woodland is a variant of the calcareous ash/Wych elm stand-type, with pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) the dominant canopy trees throughout, and with scattered concentrations of Wych elm (Ulmus glabra). Ancient woodland indicators include small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata), and wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis), both of which are locally common.

Retrieved 21 December 2014 was a Jamaican rocksteady and reggae singer who recorded for Duke Reid's lucrative Treasure Isle record label in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Life and career Dillon was born in 1944 in Linstead, St. Catherine, Jamaica, and attended the Linstead Primary School. Influenced by American singers Connie Francis, Patti Page (citation needed) and Dionne Warwick, she began singing in talent contests. It was during a performance at the Glass Bucket Club in Kingston, Jamaica with the group The Vulcans, that Duke Reid's session guitarist Lynn Taitt discovered Dillon. Dillon recorded her first record for Duke Reid, \\"Don‚Äôt Stay Away\\", in late 1966, a recording that has been described as \\"perhaps the finest female performance in Jamaican music\\".O'Brien Chang, Kevin & Chen, Wayne (1998) Reggae Routes, Temple University Press, , p. 113 While most of Dillon‚Äôs subsequent recordings would be covers of popular and obscure American songs including Bettye Swann's \\"Make Me Yours\\", Perry Como's \\"Tulips and Heather,\\" The Grass Roots' \\"Midnight Confessions,\\" and Stephen Stills's \\"Love the One You're With\\"; \\"Don't Stay Away\\" was an original composition featuring Tommy McCook and the Supersonics as the backing band. Another original song, \\"It‚Äôs Rocking Time\\" would later be turned into the Alton Ellis' hit \\"Rocksteady\\". While these early recordings demonstrate Dillon's mastery of the rocksteady sound, a much slower, soulful, response to the sultry weather that made ska's upbeat rhythm and tempo undesirable, even impracticable, it was no indication of her greatest performance, 1967's \\"Perfidia\\". Popularized by the American surf rock band The Ventures, \\"Perfidia\\" is a 1940 song written by Alberto Dom√≠nguez and made popular by the Cuban bandleader, Xavier Cugat.

The following five years, she spent living a double life. She had a family and career in banking in the United States, flying frequently back to Kingston, Jamaica to continue recording for Reid. After a number of singles and an album entitled Living in Love, Dillon ended her recording career in 1971. In 1991, Michael Bonnet, the entertainment director for the Oceanea Hotel in Kingston approached Dillon inviting her to sing. Her refusal at first was later rescinded and sparked a revitalized interest in performing and recording. In the years following, Dillion would tour the UK, Germany and Japan. In 1998 Phyllis Dillon returned to the recording studio with Lynn Taitt, marked by reinterest in ska music in the United States. She remained active until illness took hold.

It crosses the River Usk in an east--west direction, carrying the Great Western Main Line. The original bridge was constructed for the South Wales Railway and designed by the accomplished railway engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Brunel's viaduct, which was primarily constructed of creosote- treated timber, suffered a catastrophic fire near completion, resulting substantial delay and its rebuilding. The redesigned structure used considerably more wrought iron in place of wood, and included the first use of the now-common bow-string-shaped girder. This first bridge was opened to traffic during 1850. During the late 1880s, a second bridge was constructed alongside the first, which benefitted from a simpler design in comparison to the first. During the 1910s, the second bridge was extended to accommodate a quadruple track configuration, enabling the original bridge to be retired during 1925. During 2019, the lines across the second bridge were electrified as part of the 21st Century upgrade of the Great Western Main Line. History Origins and predecessors The origins of the Great Western Railway Usk bridge are closely connected with the early history of the Great Western Railway (GWR) and its renowned chief engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel . The directors of the GWR had resolved to construct a trunk route between London and Swansea, running though various cities and major settlements in between. During the 1840s, Brunel, who had been put in charge of surveying and selecting the line's route, arrived in Newport for the purpose of planning how the South Wales Railway would traverse various geographic challenges, which included a means of carrying the line across the River Usk. Brunel decided that a viaduct would be the optimal means of crossing the river and designed such a structure. Possessing eleven spans and stretching to a length of 1,200 ft, this viaduct was largely composed of timber, which was treated with creosote under pressure as to sufficiently weather-proof them against the prevailing conditions of the location. Construction work commenced during 1846. The total cost of the viaduct's construction reportedly exceeded ¬£20,000. However, its extensive use of wood heavily contributed to the bridge's destruction just prior to completion. On 31 May 1848, as the final arch was being put into place, a heated bolt used to rivet a beam together ignited the flammable creosote; within the space of six minutes, a catastrophic fire had spread across the whole structure, setting the opening back by years. Brunel swiftly redesigned the bridge explicitly to prevent any recurrence of fire. Recognising that starting from scratch would set the line's completion back even longer, he decided to incorporate the remaining structural elements into the new bridge. While some elements continued to use wood, wrought iron plates and girders were also adopted; the remaining wooden elements were subject to a different treating method, known as chyanizing. In his redesign of the bridge, Brunel effectively invented the now-common bow- string-shaped girder to replace several of the wooden sections originally used. By 1850, the Usk railway bridge was effectively complete, and the first trains crossed the structure that same. It would be in service for exactly 75 years, being retired during 1925 and dismantled soon thereafter, having been replaced by a newer bridge alongside. Current bridge In 1888, the original bridge was supplemented with a second one, which was made largely of stone. Its deck, made of metal, made use of a lattice, or criss-crossing, design to enable the supporting girders to resist bending forces; it was considered to be of a simpler and more routine design than its predecessor. By 1911, the second bridge had been widened to accommodate the running of four lines across its deck, in anticipation of the first bridge's retirement. During 2019, the tracks across the second bridge were electrified as part of the 21st Century upgrade of the Great Western Main Line. For several years prior, the bridge was subject to preparatory and improvement works to renew the structure, which included numerous repairs and all exterior surfaces being repainted during temporary closures.

It is contested annually as a one-day, three-person team event. Each team is made up of one player from each of three Tours: PGA Tour, PGA Tour Champions, and LPGA Tour. The top two scores at each hole for the team count towards the team's final score. It is held at Rhode Island Country Club in Barrington, Rhode Island. It is an unofficial event on the PGA Tour and was first played in 1999. The original format was a two-man team event, involving players solely from the PGA Tour. However, since 2017, it has become a three-person team event, with players from PGA Tour Champions and LPGA Tour joining up with a PGA Tour player to form each team. Rhode Island natives Brad Faxon and Billy Andrade serve as hosts. Television The event was televised by Golf Channel from 1999 to 2010. It was traditionally tape-delayed until 4 p.m. on both days to make buying tickets to the event more appealing. In 2009, the broadcast was delayed until 8 p.m. because the final round of the U.S. Open ran into Monday, and the Golf Channel ran post-tournament coverage during the afternoon. The Classic lost many of the PGA Tour members in its field that year because of the run over. In 2011, coverage moved to Fox Sports Net. The broadcast was still delayed until 4:00 p.m. as in past years. It was the first PGA Tour sanctioned event ever covered by a Fox network. However, Fox declined to renew its contract, as it did not cover any other golf events, and as such, the event has since been untelevised. It is unknown whether Fox might return to covering the event with the pickup of a small golf schedule, which includes the Franklin Templeton Shootout, an event very similar to the CVS Caremark Charity Classic.

Presently Zimbabwe is in the period of rebuilding itself as the domestic structure was re-structured in 2009. Many people allege that the administration of cricket in Zimbabwe was corrupted by the influence of Robert Mugabe's government, who were widely accused of following racist, in particular anti-white, policies. Positive signs began to emerge for Zimbabwe after the 2007 Cricket World Cup especially when in the 2007 World Twenty20 Zimbabwe defeated what was arguably the strongest side in the world at the time, Australia. Along with this Zimbabwe gradually began to show encouraging signs of improvement and four years later they returned to the highest format of the game, Test Cricket. In their first match since their return in August 2011 they comprehensively defeated Bangladesh. Crisis emerges During the 2000‚Äì01 season, players began to allege political interference in the running of the game in Zimbabwe. There had already been a reduction in government funding for the sport's development. The players alleged that selection of the national team was subject to interference and particularly resented the imposition of a quota system to ensure a minimum number of black players would be included. The players argued that the black players were gradually emerging, as in South Africa, and that they would increase in due course. For example, Hamilton Masakadza had already made his mark as a batsman, and Mluleki Nkala and Henry Olonga were making their mark as bowlers. The matter came to prominence before the 2003 World Cup, when both the British prime minister Tony Blair and the Australian prime minister John Howard said they would prefer it if their teams did not travel to Zimbabwe, but did not ban them from doing so. In the event, only England refused to travel to Harare to play Zimbabwe after a vote by the players citing security concerns after death threats were received, thereby forfeiting the match. In Zimbabwe's first match, two players, one white, one black (Andy Flower and Henry Olonga) wore black armbands in protest against \\"the death of democracy in Zimbabwe\\". Both players subsequently retired and emigrated from Zimbabwe, under intense political pressure, with the black Olonga being denounced as not really Zimbabwean as he was born in Zambia. Team hits rock bottom In 2004, the Zimbabwe Cricket Union sacked their white captain Heath Streak after he had confronted them with the team's grievances, several other players having also resigned by this time. Streak was replaced by the young and untested Tatenda Taibu. Fifteen senior players were involved in a stand-off over this and other selection issues, resulting in their dismissal from Zimbabwean cricket. Following poor performances by a second-string (and almost all black) Zimbabwe team against Sri Lanka, the ZCU and ICC agreed that Zimbabwe would play no Test cricket in 2004, and this self-imposed suspension remained in force from 10 June 2004 to 6 January 2005. In their first match after the suspension, Zimbabwe lost to Bangladesh at the MA Aziz Stadium in Chittagong by 226 runs. The second and final match in the series was drawn. Bangladesh had until then been generally considered the weakest team in Test cricket, and by beating Zimbabwe, recorded its first ever Test match and series victories. Bangladesh then defeated Zimbabwe in a limited overs series. In February and March 2005, Zimbabwe toured South Africa to play three LOIs and two Tests. Zimbabwe was completely and hopelessly outclassed, and Wisden 2006 described the tour as \\"gruesome\\" and \\"embarrassing to all who saw it\\". Meanwhile, in domestic cricket, the Logan Cup had been played, with just four participants, and had been won as usual by Mashonaland. But it is debatable if the competition should have retained first-class status and there were grave doubts about its future: see 2004-05 Zimbabwean cricket season. In August 2005, the New Zealand cricket team arrived in Zimbabwe to play two Test matches and duly won both by an innings with embarrassing ease. The tour was inevitably preceded by controversy because of strong feeling in New Zealand about Mugabe. As with the previous England and Australia situations, the New Zealand government advised the team not to go but did not actually bar them from doing so. Since the ICC would not accept any other reason for non-attendance, the New Zealand players turned up and won easily. However, the NZ government did have some fight in them because they effectively banned a return tour by refusing to issue visas to the Zimbabwean party. During the New Zealand series, Zimbabwe Cricket fired national coach Phil Simmons. The players signed a petition to denounce the decision and Simmons took ZC to court while they tried to have him deported. In September 2005, the visitors were India; like New Zealand, India was not barred from going to Zimbabwe and decided to go to avert ICC sanctions. In India's case, controversy erupted within its own team on account of arguments between team captain Sourav Ganguly and the new coach Greg Chappell. This row diverted the sport's attention from Zimbabwe and shifted the focus onto India. Despite its problems, the Indian team won both matches easily against sub-standard opposition. There had been a brief reconciliation with some of the rebel players, Heath Streak and Andy Blignaut having played in some of the 2005 Tests, but then the Simmons affair sparked a wider mutiny under Taibu's leadership. In October 2005, Streak announced his retirement from international cricket and indicated that he would concentrate on a county career with Warwickshire CCC in England. In November 2005, Taibu resigned as captain. He stated that: \\"If we don't do anything, cricket in Zimbabwe will die within a year\\". Taibu is now playing as an overseas player for Namibia in South African provincial competition. He, however, was surprisingly a member of the 07/08 squad for the series against Pakistan in Pakistan. Taibu was then a key cog in the national team. Hopes fade in 2006 As 2006 began, Mugabe's government replaced the board of Zimbabwe Cricket with an interim committee and this announced a further twelve month withdrawal from Test cricket. Meanwhile, the 2005‚Äì06 Logan Cup did not get under way and all the matches were indefinitely postponed. However the 2006‚Äì07 Logan Cup did take place. During 2006, Zimbabwe played a few LOIs only but was soundly beaten by Bangladesh and also lost twice to ICC associate member Kenya. For more information about the tours since 2005, see : * New Zealand cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 * Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 * Kenyan cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 * Bangladeshi cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2006 * Bangladeshi cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2006-07 The domestic game seemed to have all but deteriorated and hopes of a return to the promise that Zimbabwe showed in the 1990s looked to be forlorn.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 2006 (p. 1373-1377) concludes its account of the Zimbabwean situation with the comment: \\"But the point of no return cannot be too far away\\".  Cricket resurgence (2007‚Äì2011) By late 2007 the Zimbabwean team had defeated Australia in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and gradually signs emerged as Zimbabwe began to build on these small blocks and improve their performance bit by bit. By 2010 Zimbabwe Cricket informed the International Cricket Council that they intended to return to Test Cricket after the 2011 Cricket World Cup, the ICC agreed as a result of Zimbabwe's improving performance. In August 2011 Zimbabwe played their first Test Match in 6 years and won comprehensively defeating Bangladesh. Following the victory in the one-off Test Match, Zimbabwe sealed the ODI series 3‚Äì2. During this period of time Zimbabwe Cricket restructured itself domestically and from grassroots levels, new domestic teams emerged and a full-fledged Domestic Twenty20 tournament has seen the country's cricket infrastructure improve. The team also plans to build a stadium near Victoria Falls and has renovated Harare Sports Club along with Queen's Sports Club in Bulawayo.  Player pay dispute  In 2013, another dispute engulfed Zimbabwe Cricket. Players threatened to strike during Zimbabwe's ODI series against Pakistan in August. Negotiations made sure that players went out to play against Pakistan. Surprisingly, the unpaid Zimbabwe players defeated Pakistan in one of the three ODIs. The first test of the Test series was also under threat of a player strike but ZC made sure a team was fielded for the Test. Brendan Taylor decided not to believe ZC and sat out of the first test. Zimbabwe went on to beat a lacklustre Pakistan side in the second test match, sparking hopes of recovery for Zimbabwean cricket. These hopes were short-lived as the pay dispute got intense in December 2013, when Zimbabwean players went on strike which led to a suspension of the four- and one-day tournaments that were underway.Zim Cricketers strike again See also *Cricket in Zimbabwe  Notes  External sources * ZimbabweCricket * CricketArchive ‚Äì List of Tournaments in Zimbabwe Further reading * Wisden Cricketers Almanack 2006 (especially p. 1373‚Äì1377) Crisis Crisis Cricket controversies 2003 in Zimbabwean cricket 2004 in Zimbabwean cricket 2005 in Zimbabwean cricket 2006 in Zimbabwean cricket 2007 in Zimbabwean cricket 2008 in Zimbabwean cricket 2009 in Zimbabwean cricket 2010 in Zimbabwean cricket 2011 in Zimbabwean cricket ","title":"Zimbabwean cricket crisis"},{"id":"6407229","text":"Jacinthe Maryse Pineau (born April 26, 1974) is a Canadian former competition swimmer and butterfly specialist who represented Canada at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.

In particular, numerous players have been approached by bookmakers and bribed to throw matches, aspects of matches (e.g. the toss) or provide other information.  1999‚Äì2000 India-South Africa match fixing scandal  In 2000, the Delhi police intercepted a conversation between a blacklisted bookie and the South African cricket captain Hansie Cronje in which they learnt that Cronje accepted money to throw matches.It's Just Not CricketTwo more cricket bookies absconding after raids The South African government refused to allow any of its players to face the Indian investigation unit. A court of inquiry was set up and Cronje admitted to throwing matches. He was immediately banned from all cricket. He also named Saleem Malik (Pakistan), Mohammed Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja (India).'Azharuddin fixed matches for bookie M K Gupta...' Jadeja was banned for four years. They too were banned from all cricket. Two South African cricketers, Herschelle Gibbs and Nicky Boje, were also listed as wanted by the Delhi police for their role in the scandal.  2018 Sri Lanka cricket pitch tampering scandal  On 26 May 2018 Al Jazeera news channel findings depict that possibly pitch tampering would have happened during the home test matches involving Sri Lanka against Australia in 2016 and against India in 2017. The news channel also stated that through monitoring the pitch conditions the fixers have managed easily to make money. Match-fixers Robin Morris, a former Indian domestic cricketer along with Dubai based business person Gaurav Rajkumar, Galle groundsman Tharanga Indika and Sri Lankan first-class cricketer Tharindu Mendis have also been investigated by the ICC for attempting another pitch tampering at Galle in Sri Lanka's forthcoming first test match against England as a part of the England's upcoming series against Sri Lanka in November 2018. Concerns also raised by the English Cricket Board whether to play away series against Sri Lanka over the planned pitch tampering at the Galle Cricket Stadium for the first Test match.  Other controversies  During the third Test of the 1981 Ashes series, Australian players Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh placed a bet on England to win the match after the odds had ballooned out to 500‚Äì1. Australia were widely expected to win the match with England at 135-7 after having been made to follow-on. In a remarkable rear-guard effort, England did indeed win the match following brilliant performances from Ian Botham and Bob Willis, and Lillee and Marsh duly collected ¬£7,500 (). There has never been any suggestion that the players deliberately underperformed to ensure their bet succeeded; nevertheless, the failure of cricket authorities to censure Lillee and Marsh at the time has led some to suggest that it contributed to the match-fixing scandals of the 1990s and 2000s. Another scandal was Mark Waugh and Shane Warne's payments from \\"John the bookmaker\\" on a tour of Sri Lanka in 1994. The players had received $4,000 and $5,000 respectively from the bookmaker for pitch and weather information. When the then Australian Cricket Board found out about the incident in 1995, it fined the players. Nevertheless, the board withheld the information from the general public at the time, who were not informed until 1998. The Australian Cricket Board received widespread criticism for not immediately announcing the scandal. A later report by Rob O'Regan QC concluded that cricketers were not fully informed about the dangers of interacting with bookmakers, and although no further punishment could be given to either Waugh or Warne, in future players should be punished by not only fines, but also by suspensions. The ICC was slow to react, but did eventually in 2000 set up an Anti-Corruption and Security Unit headed by Sir Paul Condon, former head of London's Metropolitan Police. It claims to have reduced corruption in cricket to a \\"reducible minimum\\". During the fourth Test of 2010 Pakistani tour of England, News of the World published a story with allegations that Mazhar Majeed and some of the Pakistani players were involved in spot fixing. Pakistani players Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were later jailed and banned from cricket. In 2013, three cricketers from New Zealand were approached by the ICC in regards to match fixing, later named as Lou Vincent, Chris Cairns and Daryl Tuffey. In 2014, Vincent admitted to being involved in match fixing.

History The brigade started its existence as part of the 16th (Irish) Division, part of Kitchener's Army in the First World War. The 16th Division served through the war on the Western Front. The 49th Brigade also served in Kenya during the Mau Mau Uprising from 1953 to 1955-6, incorporating the 1st Battalion, Royal Northumbrian Fusiliers, and the 1st Battalion, Royal Innskilling Fusiliers, joined by the 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Fusiliers, from January 1955. However the core of the brigade's present history descends from the 49th (West Riding) Division, which fought in both World Wars. In the Second World War, the division was involved in the Norwegian Campaign, the guarding of Iceland, and Operation Overlord, where it landed in Normandy under XXX Corps. It was part of the reformed Territorial Army (as an armoured formation for a time) from 1947 to 1967. The Brigade Headquarters was reformed as a regular HQ with TA units in 1982 as part of 2nd Infantry Division. It consisted of 5th and 7th Battalions, Royal Anglian Regiment, 5th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, 3rd Battalion, The Staffordshire Regiment, the Royal Yeomanry, equipped with Fox armoured cars, 100th (Yeomanry) Regiment Royal Artillery, with 105mm Light Guns, and 307 OP Battery RA (V). The Division was tasked with the wartime rear-area security of the I (BR) Corps sector, behind the forward armoured divisions, during any Soviet thrust into Western Europe. Following the end of the Cold War, the Brigade was reorganised as 49 (East Midlands) Brigade on 1 April 1992, and then as 49 (East) Brigade on 1 April 1995 following the merger with 54 (East Anglia) Brigade. The brigade now has regional responsibility for Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire, Leicester, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, Derbyshire, Essex, Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Rutland. In April 2000 the Brigade came under command of the 4th Division based in Aldershot. As from 1 April 2007, the Brigade came under the command of the 5th Division based in Shrewsbury and as of 2012 the Brigade came under the command of Support Command.

It is a privately held company with backers including ComVentures, a venture capital firm based in Palo Alto, California, Advanced Equities and Chrysalis Ventures. Prior to November 2003, the company went by the name Interquest Communications. History Ygnition was founded in September, 2001 as a broadband Internet services company, acquiring the assets of a number of bankrupt or distressed broadband service providers. In late 2003, Ygnition launched cable television service at a number of its apartment communities and \\\\apartment building owners or developers of condominiums which previously allowed them to be the exclusive provider of certain services to residents of the apartments and condos. Ygnition will bundle Internet and VOIP service with its cable TV offering if the contract allows. These exclusivity contracts were made illegal by FCC ruling 07-889 on October 31, 2007. Cable companies have tried to fight this law but the ruling was upheld May 26 of this year by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.gg As of 2007, Ygnition has Internet access available to 150,000 apartment units and Cable television service available to 50,000 units across seven states. As Ygnition extends its market through acquisitions, it is also expanding the services offered. Ygnition is expanding into the VOIP market through partnerships with various VOIP wholesalers. Ygnition purchases cable and satellite television service from providers like DISH network and others, then redistributes them through their networks. Internet service is delivered to its service locations from anywhere from a single T1 to OC3 or ethernet over fiber, however multiple T1 circuits is the most common method. Ygnition uses traffic shaping to prioritize voice over IP (VOIP) traffic. Traffic shaping gives higher priority to latency sensitive communication (VOIP) by delaying latency insensitive communication (large file transfers).

Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, Sir Charles Moses General Manager, Australian Broadcasting Commission and John Douglas Pringle, Editor of The Sydney Morning Herald. It aimed to establish drama, opera and ballet companies nationally. Founding  In 1954 the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust was established \\"to provide a theatre of Australians by Australians for Australians\\". Named to commemorate Queen Elizabeth II's visit to Australia, the Trust raised ¬£100,000 by a public appeal.MS 5908 Records of Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust at the National Library of AustraliaAnnual Report 1957, The Australia Elizabethan Theatre Trust The Trust had an agreement with the Commonwealth government to match public donations 'in the ratio of 1:3 and to provide ongoing funding'.Roger Wettenhall, 'Kaleidoscope, or 'Now We See Them, Now We Don't!', Canberra Bulletin of Public Administration, No. 110, 2003, p. 32. With substantial contributions from both the public and the Commonwealth Government, the Trust commemorated the first visit of the Queen, who had taken the title \\"Queen of Australia\\" in 1953, and since then The Trust has been the only arts body to bear her name. The hope in 1954 was that there would occur in the arts in a new \\"Elizabethan\\" age, as productive and inspiring as the first Elizabethan age in the sixteenth century.  Development of and support for performing arts  The Trust has nurtured and seen to independence many of Australia's most significant performing arts companies including Opera Australia and the Australian Ballet Foundation. The Trust also formed, maintained and administered two music Opera and Ballet orchestras, one each in Sydney and Melbourne, to accompany ballet and opera companies, and one smaller orchestra of Sydney freelance musicians named the Elizabethan Sinfonietta. The Trust played a key role in establishing high culture in Australia through its involvement in setting up: * The Elizabethan Theatre Trust Opera Company (now Opera Australia) in 1956 * The Elizabethan Opera Ballet Company, a short lived ballet company set up in 1957, and with J. C. Williamson Ltd the Australian Ballet Foundation in 1961 and the Australian Ballet School under the direction of Margaret Scott * The Elizabethan Trust Orchestra in 1967, which in 1969 expanded into two orchestras, one each resident in Melbourne and Sydney. These orchestras became the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra in 1991, and State Orchestra of Victoria in 1986. The SOV has since been renamed Orchestra Victoria It has also supported: * National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) * Marionette Theatre of Australia * Australian Theatre of the Deaf * Old Tote Theatre Company * Melbourne Theatre Company * South Australian Theatre Company. Following the establishment of the Australian Council for the Arts in 1968, it ceased to be a funding body for opera and ballet in 1970. In 1974, Geoffrey Wynter Armstrong bequeathed a sum of money to the Trust to establish a memorial fund to be known as the Geoffrey Wynter Armstrong and Elizabeth Mary Martin Scholarship. The annual award is currently administered by Music & Opera Singers Trust Limited.  Change in focus  During the 1980s the Trust scaled back its operations and in the 1990s had a Sydney focus and operated a ticketing agency and organised theatre parties. In 1990, the Trust went into provisional receivership and its operations were scaled back by its Administrator. Its arts promotion role passed to the Australian Council for the Arts (later the Australia Council).[4] Management of The Trust was given back to the Directors in 1992. In 2000, the Trust launched its international music scholarship program for Australian singers, musicians and conductors wishing to undertake overseas music study. This assists musicians, singers and conductors in all music genres in making a unique, original and valuable contribution to Australian culture. Since 2000 there have been 107 music scholarships awarded with a total value of $1,337,559. Of these there have been 29 awards to singers for study in The Netherlands, UK, France, USA, Germany and Italy. Musicians have received awards for chamber music, orchestral and solo study in UK, Europe and USA. There are no restrictions on scholars applying for further assistance and it is the Trust's view that it should stand by and support, when practical, a scholars' musical development for life. In 2004 the Trust purchased the Independent Theatre at North Sydney and undertook a major acoustical and heritage refurbishment of the venue. This initiative resulted in the production of a fine chamber music venue with an outstanding acoustic quality for both performers and audience. The Trust sold the Independent in 2013 to Wenona School who have continued the chamber music programs. Chairs of the Board *H. C.

As the first director of the Australian Ballet School, she is recognised as one of the founders of the strong ballet tradition of her adopted country.Michelle Potter, Dame Maggie Scott: A Life in Dance (Melbourne: Text Publishing, 2014). With an introduction by Graeme Murphy. Early life and training Margaret Scott was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, the youngest of three, including twins Joan and Barbara. As a child, she was encouraged by her free-spirited family to pursue her interest in dance, which had developed early in her childhood. Throughout her youth, she attended ballet classes at the Conmee School of Dancing, where, under the direction of London-trained Ivy Conmee, instruction was given according to the syllabus of the Royal Academy of Dancing. On graduation from the Parktown Convent School, Scott went with her mother to London in 1939, when she was 17, and auditioned successfully for entrance to the Sadler's Wells Ballet School. There she polished her classical technique under the demanding tutelage of Dame Ninette de Valois and a faculty of renowned teachers.Geoffrey William Hutton and Michelle Potter, \\"Scott, Margaret\\", in International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 4, p. 563. Dancing in England Despite the outbreak of war with Germany in September 1939, soon after her arrival in England, Scott decided to remain in London and continue her dance training. After some months at the Sadler's Wells school, she joined the Sadler's Wells Ballet and began her professional career. She stayed with the company only a year. Attracted by the more adventurous repertory of Ballet Rambert, she applied to Marie Rambert and was engaged as a soloist with her company.Mary Clarke, Dancers of Mercury: The Story of Ballet Rambert (London: A. & C. Black, 1962). Promoted to principal dancer in 1943, Scott spent five more years with Ballet Rambert, dancing leading and supporting roles in the repertory, including audience favourites such as Michel Fokine's Les Sylphides and Antony Tudor's Jardin aux Lilas as well as new works by Andr√©e Howard, Frank Staff, and Walter Gore.Angela Kane, \\"Rambert Dance Company\\" (parts 1-3), Dance Theatre Research (London), 8, 10 (Autumn 1990 ‚Äì Autumn 1992). The war years were difficult ones for the Rambert company, but it began to recover its strength and popularity after the war.Clement Crisp, Anya Sainsbury, and Peter Williams, eds., Ballet Rambert: Fifty Years and On, rev. & enl. ed. (Ilkley, West Yorkshire: Scolars Press, 1981). In 1947, Ballet Rambert toured Australia, under the auspices of D. D. O'Connor and the British Council. The company's highly successful tour was extended several times until eighteen months had been spent away from home. When the tour ended, some dancers, including Scott and Sally Gilmour, chose to remain in Australia.Alastair Macaulay, \\"Rambert Dance Company,\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 4, p. 301. Dancing in Australia In 1949, Scott was a founding member of Gertrude Johnson's National Theatre Ballet, based in Melbourne and directed by Joyce Graeme, a former principal dancer with Ballet Rambert. During the Christmas season of 1949, Scott appeared in a featured role in The Glass Slipper, a retelling of the Cinderella story, and early in 1950 she danced the barefoot role of the Thipa Thipa Bird in Corroboree, choreographed by Rex Reid to music by John Antill.Staff writer, \\"Margaret Scott,\\" Live Performance Australia, website, http://liveperformance.com.au/halloffame/margaretscott2.html. Retrieved 28 November 2015. Later that year she restaged Frank Staff's charming Peter and the Wolf, which he had created in 1940 for Ballet Rambert. In 1951, she tried her hand at original choreography, setting Apollon Musag√®te to the Igor Stravinsky score for Laurel Martyn's Victorian Ballet Guild. She returned to London in 1952 and was one of six dancers invited by John Cranko to perform his works at the Kenton Theatre in Henley-on-Thames and at the Aldeburgh Festival. She then rejoined the Rambert company as ballet mistress and assistant to Madam Rambert, in which roles she was responsible for directing the company on tour.Potter, Dame Maggie Scott:: A Life in Dance (2014).Crisp et al., Ballet Rambert: Fifty Years and On (1981). Teaching in Australia In March 1953, Scott married Derek Denton, an Australian medical doctor and researcher, and subsequently returned with him to Australia. For the next two years she taught classes and managed the school of Paul Hammond and his wife Peggy Sager while they were on tour with the Borovansky Ballet. She then opened her own school in a church hall in Toorak, a prestigious suburb of Melbourne. In the late 1950s, she participated in negotiations with the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust that led to the formation of the Australian Ballet in 1962 under the direction of Peggy van Praagh.Potter, Dame Maggie Scott: A Life in Dance (2014). Scott then undertook planning for the foundation of the Australian Ballet School, which was realised in 1964. Appointed by Van Praagh as the first director of the school, she remained in this post for 26 years, until she retired in 1990.Pamela Ruskin, Invitation to the Dance: The Story of the Australian Ballet School (Sydney: Collins, 1989). During her long tenure, she exerted a powerful influence on the development of the school and its students, many of whom became remarkable dancers, choreographers, directors, and teachers,Pamela Ruskin, \\"A Tribute to Dame Margaret,\\" Dance Australia (Keyesborough) 46 (February‚ÄìMarch 1990), pp. 23, 25. including Marilyn Rowe, celebrated ballerina and former director of the Australian Ballet School, and Graeme Murphy, former director of the Sydney Dance Company and internationally known choreographer.Michael Winkler, \\"Dancing through Life,\\" The Age, website, http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/09/20/1095651237495.html.

Related activities During her years as director and administrator of the Australian Ballet School, Scott also choreographed several ballets, notably Recollections of a Beloved Place, set to music by Tchaikovsky, for Ballet Victoria in 1975. She expanded her activities in the performing arts as representative of Australia on the Council of the World Dance Alliance, as a jurist at international ballet competitions in Moscow, and as leader of a group of teachers at ballet companies in Beijing and Shanghai. During the 1990s, Dame Margaret returned to the stage on a number of occasions. In 1990, she danced as Aunt Sophy in a gala performance of The Nutcracker, produced in her honour by Robert Ray, and she showed herself to be a talented actress in a non-dancing role in the play In the Body of the Son by Nicholas Rowe, presented at the Darwin Festival in 1995. Her greatest triumph, however, came in 1992, when, at the age of 70, she appeared as Clara the Elder in Nutcracker: The Story of Clara, Graeme Murphy's imaginative reinterpretation of the Christmas classic. She repeated the role during the 1994 and 2000 seasons of the Australian Ballet.Potter, Dame Maggie Scott: A Life in Dance (2014), pp. 267-283.Lee Christofis, interview, \\"Coming of Age: Retrieving History with Dame Margaret Scott and Valrene Tweedie, OAM,\\" Brolga: A Journal about Dance (Braddon, A.C.T.) 13 (December 2000), pp. 46-51.

Over the years, Scott had been a part-time student of teaching methods at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT), where she eventually gained a graduate diploma in visual and performing arts in 2000. She was granted an honorary degree of Doctor of Education from her alma mater in 2001. In 2007, she was the recipient of the James Cassius Williamson Award, given by Live Performance Australia in recognition of \\"individuals who have made an outstanding contribution in the Australian live entertainment and performing arts industry and shaped the future of the industry for the better\\". Personal life Scott met Derek Denton, a doctor at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, in 1947, when she and her friend Sally Gilmour went there to deliver flowers received after the triumphant opening night of Ballet Rambert. They married in 1953 and had two sons. Denton founded the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health. After their marriage, he continued to publish his research into the nature of consciousness in animals, and she remained actively engaged in the dance world.Winkler, \\"Dancing through Life,\\" The Age, website, http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/09/20/10956512337495.html..

They have a white belly and a white finching stripe along the spine and continuing over the tail, and they normally have well-developed white horns with black tips.  History  Cattle of similar type were numerous in the Cotswold Hills and the Severn Valley of England as early as the 13th century. They were valued for their milk (used for Gloucester cheeses), for providing strong and docile draught oxen and finally for their beef. By 1972 only one significant herd remained and the breed was in danger of dying out. The Gloucester Cattle Society was revived in 1973 and the breed has moved from near extinction to being rated by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust as being \\"At Risk\\", as there are still fewer than 750 registered breeding females.Rare Breeds Survival Trust watch list accessed 21 May 2008 The milk of Gloucesters is well-suited to cheese-making, being high in protein and with high butterfat, in particularly small globules.

Double Gloucester cheese may now be made from the milk of any cattle, although it was traditionally made from that of Gloucesters.

In the late 1990s, it was at one time mirrored in seven countries and had a tumultuous history of being purchased by different corporations over its 11-year existence. It was active from March 1994 until March 2005. By 2002, the Domain was considered one of the leading gaming sites, with approximately 1.4 million users and 15 million page views per month. It also had two sister sites - Kids Domain, focusing on children's titles, and Console Domain, focusing on console games. The site's primary URLs were www.gamesdomain.co.uk (UK) and www.gamesdomain.com (US). The site's main areas were the GD Review, an online magazine which consisted mostly of staff reviews and previews of games; the Downloads section, featuring game demos, patches, and shareware; and the Games Info section, with FAQs and walkthroughs. History of ownership In early 1998, Games Domain was acquired by The Attitude Network, which also hosted popular gaming site HappyPuppy.com. Theglobe.com, at the time a successful new web portal, purchased Attitude Network in a $52.8 million deal in April 1999. By 2000, after acquiring games retailer Chips & Bits and Computer Games Magazine publisher Strategy Plus, theglobe.com was considered the second largest online gaming network. However, like several companies from the dotcom era, the company went bust within two years. Theglobe.com sold these operations in August 2001 and continued with a reduced games division consisting of just Computer Games Magazine and the Chips & Bits mail-order service until the present day. The site had been up for sale since July 2001, and would not find a home until October of that year. BT Openworld, the internet arm of British Telecom, purchased Games Domain to boost its online gaming division. BT launched a new service on the site called Games Domain Multiplay in November 2001, providing servers for online gamers at a price. It was unsuccessful, and within 16 months the Multiplay service was shut down. In November 2003, BT sold Games Domain to Yahoo!. The site would be integrated into Yahoo's Games channel. During the Yahoo years, Games Domain was revamped visually and covered both console and PC games until Yahoo abandoned the brand and URL in March 2005. Organization hierarchy and its effect From the early start and through its development up until the point of the theGlobe.com acquisition, Games Domain used a combinatorial management system incorporating internal office staff and external \\"online\\" managers to produce downloads and online publications. Dave Stanworth held the system together from his Birmingham office with programmers and some staff writers, while Games Domain Review internet writers from all over the world, showing talent and work ethic, were promoted to section editors of various gaming categories, called \\"Zones\\", such as Role Playing Games (RPG), Strategy, Sport, Adventure and Action. Under these Zone managers (editors) were various freelance game reviewers. Section editors had the job of coordinating game reviewers for their subcategory, and for writing monthly editorials as well as contributing game reviews. The initial philosophy of Games Domain Review was that a reviewer should complete the entire game, and write a lengthy, honest review, regardless of marketing influences. For this reason, Games Domain was initially considered unbiased in its reviews of various games. Staff editors, responsible for their subcategories, were also involved in management decisions. Staff discussions were conducted via email, in a lengthy, sometimes intense process. This form of management reflected the pseudo-anarchical style of earlier internet developments, and was reflected in nearly all decisions regarding the presentation of Games Domain to the public, including the award of excellence such as a gold or silver medal to a computer game. Such an award was discussed among all editors and management, and regardless of the originating editor's opinion (who most likely reviewed the game personally) a consensus would or must be achieved. Endless debates were ignited via this system. Although entirely inefficient in most respects, the management system insured that game enthusiasts were, via debate and thorough peer review, providing readers with the optimal commentary on games and developments. At the same time, when changes were deemed necessary due to marketing pressures such as the necessity for faster turn-around times, and then ultimately various acquisitions, the system proved inflexible and in part contributed both to the high success of Games Domain at the peak of the dotcom era, and then to its ultimate decline. Editors Although Games Domain has now been absorbed into Yahoo's games channel, at the time of writing (March 2008) original GD Review editor Richard Greenhill still works for Yahoo and writes a regular editor's column.

A completely new court system and order of legal proceedings were established. The main results were the introduction of a unified judicial system instead of a cumbersome set of estates of the realm courts, and fundamental changes in criminal trials. The latter included the establishment of the principle of equality of the parties involved, the introduction of public hearings, the jury trial, and a professional advocate that had never existed in Russia. However, there were also problems, as certain obsolete institutions were not covered by the reform. Also, the reform was hindered by extrajudicial punishment, introduced on a widespread scale during the reigns of his successors ‚Äì Alexander III and Nicholas II.Richard Wortman, \\"Russian monarchy and the rule of law: New considerations of the court reform of 1864.\\" Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History 6.1 (2005): 145-170. The judicial reforms started on 20 November 1864, when the tsar signed the decree which enforced four Regulations (Establishment of Judicial Settlements, Regulations of Civil Proceedings, Regulations of Criminal Proceedings, and Regulations of Punishments Imposed by Justices of the Peace). Court system The court system of Imperial Russia had remained intact since the reign of Catherine II. It included Estates-of-the-realm courts for different estates of the realm. Alexander II introduced a unified two-level system which consisted of General judicial settlements (–û–±—â–∏–µ —Å—É–¥–µ–±–Ω—ã–µ —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è) and Local judicial settlements (–ú–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–µ —Å—É–¥–µ–±–Ω—ã–µ —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è), where settlement (—É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ) stands for body or office. Courts were separated from the executive branch.Sergei M. Kazantsev, \\"The judicial reform of 1864 and the procuracy in Russia.\\" in Reforming Justice in Russia, 1864-1994: Power, Culture and the Limits of Legal Order;; (Routledge, 2017). 44-60. General judicial settlements An 1850s caricature ridiculing the pre-reform court system General judicial settlements included district courts, judicial chambers, and the Senate.Sergei M. Kazantsev, \\"The judicial reform of 1864 and the procuracy in Russia.\\" in Reforming Justice in Russia, 1864-1994: Power, Culture and the Limits of Legal Order (Routledge, 2017) pp. 44-60. Each district court covered several uyezds. Judges were nominated by the Minister of Justice and appointed by the tsar. A judge had to meet certain requirements, which included a length of service, an immaculate reputation, and a property qualification. There was no fixed tenure for district court judges. The law provided that different cases depending on the gravity of the offence and on the difficulty of investigation were heard by different boards of judges. The board could include three judges, the judge and the jury or the judge and representatives of the estates. The introduction of representatives of the estates, who enjoyed the same rights as judges, was heavily criticized as inconsistent with unification of court system. One of the most important results of the reform was wide introduction of jury trials. The jury trial included three professional judges and twelve jurors. A juror had to possess real estate of a certain value. Unlike in modern jury trials, jurors not only could decide whether the defendant was guilty or not guilty but also could decide that the defendant was guilty but not to be punished, as Alexander II believed that justice without morality is wrong. The sentence was rendered by professional judges.Samuel Kucherov, \\"The Jury as Part of the Russian Judicial Reform of 1864.\\" American Slavic and East European Review 9.2 (1950): 77-90. Unlike trials with estate of the realm representatives who could also sit in upper courts, jury trials were held only on the level of district court. Most liberals praised introduction of jury trials-a few intellectuals criticized them. Two examples of such critics can be seen in Leo Tolstoy's Resurrection and Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov. In 1878, the revolutionary Vera Zasulich failed to assassinate St. Petersburg Governor-General Fyodor Trepov, who had ordered a political prisoner to be flogged. Even though it was obvious that Zasulich was guilty, the jury acquitted her completely. The verdict of the jury was based not on the law but on their feeling of injustice committed by Trepov, a case of jury nullification. Judicial chambers were courts of appeal for cases heard in district courts. They also had original jurisdiction in certain high crimes (usually if the offender was an official). Each judicial chamber covered several guberniyas. Judges were also appointed by the tsar. The highest court was the Senate. It included the Department of Cassation in civil cases and Department of Cassation in criminal cases. They heard appeals brought on cases heard in lower courts. The Department of Cassation, in criminal cases, was also the court of first instance for the most serious crimes. In 1877, within the Senate, the Disciplinary Commission for judges was established. The Regulations also provided for an extraordinary Supreme Criminal Court. It was convened if a serious crime was committed by highest officials or for an assassination attempt on the tsar or his relatives. Local judicial settlements The Regulations provided for establishment of local courts with justices of the peace, who were supposed to deal with minor offences and could not impose a sentence over one year of imprisonment. Each justice of the peace was supposed to serve in a circuit, one uyezd comprising several circuits. They were elected for three years by zemstvas. However, in many areas, there were not enough candidates who could meet the requirements for election. In other areas local authorities hindered the process of election. In several Western regions justices of the peace eventually were appointed by the Minister of Justice. In 1889, the whole institution was abolished everywhere except for Moscow and St. Petersburg. The powers of justices of the peace were vested in local executive authorities. They were restored in 1912, but the monarchy was already about to collapse. Regulations Concerning Peasants Leaving Serf Dependence (–ü–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è –æ –∫—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—å—è–Ω–∞—Ö –≤—ã—Ö–æ–¥—è—â–∏—Ö –∏–∑ –∫—Ä–µ–ø–æ—Å—Ç–Ω–æ–π –∑–∞–≤–∏—Å–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏) provided for creation of volost' courts to deal with minor offences committed by the peasants. Judges in such courts were local peasants who had to be literate and not have convictions. They were elected for three years by electors elected by the peasants themselves. Appeals on decisions rendered by volost' courts were lodged to upper rural courts, which consisted of chairmen of local volost' courts. The sentence rendered by an upper rural court had to be supervised either by the justice of the peace or (if none) by local authorities. Court-martial Courts martial existed separately from other courts. The system of courts martial was listed in Court-Martial Regulations 1867. According to it, minor crimes were dealt with in regiment court. The judges were officers appointed by the head of the regiment. In order to enforce the decision, consent of the head of the regiment was required. Grave crimes and appeals were dealt with in district courts martial. The highest instance was the Supreme Court-Martial. The members of the Supreme Court-Martial were appointed by the tsar.Aurele J. Violette, \\"Judicial reforms in the Russian Navy during the'Era of Great reforms': The reform act of 1867 and the abolition of Corporal punishment.\\" Slavonic and East European Review (1978): 586-603. Improvement of the criminal trial Before the reform, parties in the criminal trial did not have equal rights. The defendant had no legal counsel (legal assistance and legal representation were allowed in civil cases only). There was no distinction between trial in the court and both investigation and trial conducted by police. The judicial reform instituted the modern criminal trial based on the principle of equality of the parties. The defendant was allowed to have legal representation. The defence was now able to search for or provide evidence to the court, and the court itself ceased to perform investigative functions. Its only task was to decide which party presented more convincing evidence. Introduction of jury trial rapidly increased acquittals. The trial, in all courts except for the Senate, was now public.Girish N. Bhat, \\"The Moralization of Guilt in Late Imperial Russian Trial by Jury: The Early Reform Era.\\" Law and History Review 15.1 (1997): 77-113. Institution of the bar association Prior to 1864, there was no bar association. There were scriveners (—Å—Ç—Ä—è–ø—á–∏–∏), who did not have to satisfy any requirements and had very limited powers. The aim of the bar (; barrister: –ø—Ä–∏—Å—è–∂–Ω—ã–π –ø–æ–≤–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π) was to guarantee that each defendant would have access to qualified legal assistance. Also, one of the tasks of the bar was to give free legal advice to the poor. The bar was an independent corporation which had its own administration in each guberniya (Council of Barristers ‚Äì –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç –ø—Ä–∏—Å—è–∂–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–æ–≤–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö), which dealt with various organizational matters, imposed various disciplinary penalties on its members (expulsion was common). In 1874 their powers were transferred to local courts, and the independence of the bar was reduced. The new regulations enumerated the requirements for barristers, and the association could refuse entry into the bar without reason. William Pomeranz, . \\"'Profession or Estate'?

Powhatan's Chimney was long considered clue to the site of Werowocomoco, a capital village of Chief Powhatan in what is now Virginia. According to English colonist Captain John Smith, Werowocomoco was located on the north side of the York River about from where the river divided at West Point, Virginia, at the time the Jamestown Settlement was established in 1607. Soon after in 1609, Chief Powhatan relocated his capital to a more inland location for better security. The exact location of Werowocomoco was lost through changes in settlement patterns. The Powhatan Confederacy and its people were largely displaced by English settlers by the middle of the 17th century. Powhatan's Chimney Monument Legend tells that Powhatan's Chimney was from a house that Smith built at Werowocomoco for the chief. The chimney's collapse in 1888 led to the growth of a preservation movement, and the founding of Preservation Virginia (formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities). It was organized to protect and preserve other historic resources. This organization reconstructed the chimney in the 1930s in the belief that it represented the historic site of Powhatan's residence at his capital.\\"Powhatan Chimney\\" , Gloucester History In 1977, an archaeologist found ground-surface artifacts at a site further west on the York River on Purtan Bay that indicated a late Woodland/early European contact-era settlement.

The couple had five children together before they travelled aboard their luxury yacht Sunbeam. The yacht was said to have been named after their daughter ‚Äì Constance Alberta ‚Äì who was nicknamed Sunbeam; she died of scarlet fever, aged four, on 24 January 1873.

Early life Crosby was born in New York City in 1856. He was the son of the Rev. Dr. Howard Crosby (1826-1891), a Presbyterian minister,Ralph E. Luker, The Social Gospel in Black and White: American Racial Reform, 1885-1912 (UNC Press Books, 1998):242. and Margaret Evertson Givan, a descendant of the prominent Dutch Evertson family. Crosby was a relative of prolific hymn-writer and rescue mission worker Fanny Crosby. He was educated at New York University and the Columbia Law School. He was a member of the Delta Phi fraternity during his time at New York University. Career While a member of the State Assembly (1887‚Äì1889), he introduced three high-license bills, all vetoed by the Governor David Bennett Hill. From 1889 to 1894, he was judge of the Court of the First Instance at Alexandria, Egypt. He became an exponent of the theories of Count Tolstoy, whom he visited before his return to America; his relations with the great Russian later ripened into intimate friendship, and he devoted himself in America largely to promulgating Tolstoy's ideas of universal peace. His book, Plain Talk in Psalm and Parable (1899), was widely commended by such writers as Bj√∂rnson, Kropotkin, and Zangwill. Crosby was a vegetarian and supporter of animal rights,Iacobbo & Iacobbo, Vegetarian America: A History, (Praeger, 2004), pp. 143‚Äì147. authoring an essay entitled \\"The Meat Fetish\\", published in the Humanitarian League's quarterly publication, the Humane Review in 1904; this was later published as a pamphlet. He was also president of the New York Vegetarian Society. Like the Englishman Edward Carpenter, the subject of his book Poet and Prophet, Crosby's poetry (in the volume Swords and Plowshares) followed the example of Whitman's free verse. Death and Burial Crosby died of pneumonia in Baltimore, Maryland on January 3, 1907. His remains were transported to New York and he was buried in Rhinebeck, New York, where he maintained an estate. Personal life In 1881, Crosby married Frances (Fanny) Kendall Schieffelin, daughter of Henry Maunsell Schieffelin. Their children were Margaret Eleanor and Maunsell Schieffelin Crosby.Derby, George and White, James Terry.

The album's title is slightly misleading, in that it is not an entirely new volume: the second part of the previous installment in the Metal Fingers series (confusingly also called Special Herbs, Vol. 4 but also commonly known as Special Herbs, Vols. 3 & 4; it is this latter \\"Volume 4\\" that is duplicated), appears again here as the first eight tracks of Vols. 4, 5 & 6\\\\. The difference in record labels on which the various albums were released explains this anomaly, similar to the earlier doublings of Vol. 2 and Vol. 4. After this volume, the numbering of the series becomes more consistent, and there are no such overlapping tracks. The original artwork for both the CD and vinyl versions contained depictions of Marvel Comics' Doctor Doom character (from the Fantastic Four).

It was started by Thomas Brassey, 1st Earl Brassey in 1886. Though often compared with Jane's Fighting Ships, the two British annuals were, in fact quite different. The Brassey series began a dozen years earlier, and its special strength was the dozen or more detailed articles on naval (plus, from 1920 through 1935, merchant marine) matters, authored by experts. They covered British and other nations' naval developments ranging from the latest ships to overall policy. The first five or six Brassey volumes used a second printing color (a light blue green) to highlight armored portions of naval vessels' hulls. Through 1949, the series was also known for its extensive tabular presentations of individual ship details. But unlike Jane's, the Brassey series was not designed for use in identifying ships at sea. Starting with the 1950 volume, content broadened to cover air force and army topics in addition to naval material, with a continued emphasis on British forces. Long runs of the Brassey volumes are relatively uncommon in American libraries. During its life it underwent a number of title changes.

He also served as chairman of the All Dulles Area Muslim Society (ADAMS), and Deputy Secretary General of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth. Totonji was born in Iraq, and is a citizen of Saudi Arabia.Ben Johnson, A Troubling Presence at a Funeral, Front Page Magazine, June 11, 2004 Whilst studying for a BSc in Petroleum Production Engineering at Birmingham University, he simultaneously began networking with fellow students and the wider Muslim community, devoting precious time and energy to establishing a number of organizations in the UK including the Muslim Students Society (MSS) of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, and later on the Muslim Students Association (MSA) of Europe. Overcoming many challenges and witnessing first hand the impact of mobilizing others and developing their strengths for ethical community work, a vision was born towards whose active realization he has devoted the rest of his life. Having obtained his BSc, he then travelled to the USA to study for a doctorate in Petroleum Engineering at Pennsylvania State University. Once again whilst pursuing his studies at the University Dr. Totonji continued to work tirelessly in the service of the Muslim community and youth, networking with fellow students and community members on a number of projects, the most important of which culminated in the establishment of the Muslim Students Association (MSA) of the United States and Canada. This was the 1960s, a decade which witnessed Dr. Totonji not only become President of the MSA, but network and develop relations with major American personalities in the Muslim community at the time, those who were influencing the US Muslim context. These included such notable figures as Malcolm X, those involved in the civil rights struggle, and the late legendary boxer, Muhammad Ali. His work then took on an international dimension which saw him over the decades visit all four corners of the world. On the professional career level, he established the College of Petroleum and Mineral Engineering in Libya and the Department of Petroleum in Saudi Arabia; on the dawah level he helped establish the World Assembly of Muslim Youth (WAMY); and on the relief level the International Islamic Charitable Organization (IICO). This is but a glimpse of Dr. Totonji's projects, for on an even greater scale they encompassed the establishment of a wide variety of institutions, both academic and volunteer work-related, in many countries both within and outside the Muslim world.

Wilson plays a dojo sensei in California who travels to Manila to avenge his professional kickboxer brother, who was murdered after a fight. It has become a cult film. Plot A man gets beaten by his opponent, but after he finds out the fight was rigged, he decides to fight back. He kills his opponent and is announced as the winner. On his way back to his home, another man kills him. Back in the United States, retired boxer Jake Raye and co-owner of Hal and Jake's self-defense class receives a call from the Philippines police department. He is told his half-brother Michael is dead, and he must pick up the body in Manila. Raye travels to Manila and collects the body, but he decides to stay there and find his brother's killer. Raye gets training help from a man named Kwong and stays with local kickboxer Baby Davies, upon whom local Filipino neighbor Angela has a crush, and his sister Nancy. Kwong tells Raye about a gladiator-like tournament known as the Red Fist Tournament where only one comes out alive, and his brother's killer will likely be there. Kwong trains Raye for the tournament and enters him. He manages to win all the fights and proceeds to the final match, where he faces off with Chin Woo. Kwong tells him that Chin Woo is his brother's killer and also the fighter who put Baby Davis in a coma. Hal, who has come from California to watch Raye's final bout, informs Raye that Kwong is the killer after Kwong drugs Raye. Angela comes in with a gun, but dies at the hands of Chin Woo. Woo is defeated by Raye, who sets off after Michael's true killer. Kwong reveals that his brother was the fighter who died at the hands of Michael that night, and that Kwong is the one who murdered him. Kwong fights Raye in the same alley where Michael died.
