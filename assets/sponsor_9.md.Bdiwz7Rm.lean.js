An advocate of using social science to address issues of public concern, he was the Director of the London School of Economics and Political Science from September 2012 until September 2016, after which he became the first president of the Berggruen Institute. Prior to leading LSE, Calhoun led the Social Science Research Council, and was University Professor of the Social Sciences at New York University and Director of NYU's Institute for Public Knowledge. With Richard Sennett he co-founded NYLON, an interdisciplinary working seminar for graduate students in New York and London who bring ethnographic and historical research to bear on politics, culture, and society.  Biography  Calhoun was born in Watseka, Illinois, on June 16, 1952. He studied anthropology and cinema at the University of Southern California, (BA, 1972), anthropology and sociology at Columbia University (MA, 1974), and social anthropology at Manchester University (MA, (Econ.), 1975). He received his doctorate in sociology and modern social and economic history from Oxford University in 1980, a student of J.C. Mitchell, Angus MacIntyre, and R.M. Hartwell. He taught at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1977 to 1996. There he was also Dean of the Graduate School and founding Director of the University Center for International Studies. He moved to NYU in 1996 as Chair of the Department of Sociology in a period of major rebuilding. He left for Columbia in 2006 but returned to NYU as Director of the Institute for Public Knowledge (IPK), which promotes collaborations among academics from diverse disciplinary backgrounds and between academics and working professionals. In September 2012 he became the Director and President of the London School of Economics. Calhoun has also taught at the Beijing Foreign Studies University, the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, University of Asmara, University of Khartoum, University of Oslo, and Oxford itself. He was Benjamin Meaker Distinguished Visiting Professor at the University of Bristol in 2000 and received an honorary doctorate from La Trobe University in Melbourne in 2005. Calhoun is married to Pamela F. DeLargy, who is a public health and Horn of Africa specialist, and who served in the United Nations in Eritrea, Sudan, Sierra Leone and headed the humanitarian response programmes of UNFPA for a decade. She is currently Senior Advisor to Peter Sutherland, the U.N. Special Representative for Migration.  Work  From 1999 to 2012 Calhoun was President of the Social Science Research Council. At the SSRC Calhoun emphasized the public contributions of social science. His views are explained in his essay \\"Towards a More Public Social Science\\", which first appeared in the SSRC's 2004 \\"President's Report\\" and has been translated, reprinted and widely circulated on the web.Calhoun, Craig Jackson (2004). \\"Towards a More Public Social Science\\". Social Science Research Council. ssrc.org. Retrieved 10 September 2017. After September 11, 2001 he launched an initiative on \\"Real Time Social Science\\" which included an essay forum that attracted more than one million readers. This continued with work on the Privatization of Risk, Understanding Katrina: Perspectives from the Social Sciences Program, and now Haiti, Now and Next (examining the impact of the 2010 earthquake on Haiti's social and political future). His conversations with Paul Price have received wide circulation, podcast as Societas. Calhoun has written more than 100 scholarly articles and chapters as well as books, among which his most famous is a study of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Neither Gods Nor Emperors: Students and the Struggle for Democracy in China (California, 1994). Calhoun's work has been translated into more than a dozen languages. Thesis Eleven (2006, Vol. 84, No. 1) devoted a special issue to his work, \\"Craig Calhoun: Critical Social Sciences and the Public Sphere.\\" He was also editor in chief of the Oxford Dictionary of the Social Sciences. His recent work has focused on the future of capitalism and on humanitarianism. He has also written on Brexit and the rise of populism. As the Director of the London School of Economics and Political Science Calhoun was in the academic year 2012-13 the beneficiary of \\"one of the biggest increases in overall pay and benefits\\" in the British higher education sector.http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/big-pay-rises-for-russell- group-chiefs-in-9k-fees- era/2010075.articlehttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/03/new- breed-fat-cats-university-boss-vice-chancellors?CMP=twt_gu As Director, Calhoun was very successful in raising funds for the LSE, including millions from the Marshall Foundation, Atlantic Philanthropies, and many other donors. Also during his tenure, LSE begun work on a new Global Centre for Social Sciences, and rose significantly in global university rankings, rising from 71st to 35th best university in the world between 2014 and 2015 in QS World University Rankings. In December 2015 it was announced he would not seek a further term at LSE, instead choosing to step down and return to the United States in 2016 as President of the Berggruen Institute in Los Angeles. In August 2017, British media published critical reports that Calhoun had been paid ¬£1.7 million over four years and a London apartment with a market rent of ¬£120,000 a year, despite LSE being criticised for its low teaching standards.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/08/01/university-given- one-uks-lowest-teaching-ratings-paid-vice- chancellor/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/london-school-of-economics- spent-thousands-on-farewell-gifts-for-director-craig-calhoun-h5x928z69 As president of the Berggruen Institute, Calhoun launched the million-dollar Berggruen Philosophy Prize, and oversaw the development of its Los Angeles and Beijing campuses. In May 2018, it was announced that Calhoun would be stepping down from the Berggruen Institute in order to become University Professor of Social Sciences at Arizona State University, effective July 1, 2018.

The subject of the book deals with the exploration of Darwin's principles across the political spectrum, from fascism and its well documented usage of Darwinism to the usage by anarchists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The lighthouse was established in 1857, although the vicinity was under the control of the Isle of Man Harbour Board from 1832. It was made by the engineering brothers David and Thomas Stevenson with a total elevation of . The white tower is in height and its base is at an elevation of . The lighthouse staircase has 71 steps and the light has an average range of . The lantern is composed of eight brilliant reflectors made of pure silver built in 1831. The light flashes white every ten seconds. History The lighthouse before 1892 Structural problems required the lighthouse to be rebuilt in 1892. The lighthouse became automated in 1986. Recently, a new public footpath was constructed by the Commissioners from the top of Port Skillion down to the Lighthouse for the benefit and enjoyment of tourists and sightseers. Ownership After the establishment of the new lighthouse in 1857, jurisdiction transferred from the Commissioners of Douglas Harbour to the Commissioners of the Northern Lighthouse. The lighthouse is still run to this day by the Commissioners of the Northern Lighthouse, who also operate the Northern lighthouse on the Isle of Man. Etymology The modern completed lighthouse with foghorn c.1907 with courthouses The name Douglas means 'Blackstream' (Dubh -black and Glais -stream. Some Manx people believe the name was derived from two rivers, the Dhoo and the Glass, the black and green streams of the Greu river. Specifics of the light The high light has two double banked units of twelve lamps mounted facing in opposite directions, rotated by an AGA PRB21 Gearless Drive Unit operating at three revolutions-per-minute, thus giving a flash in any given direction every ten seconds. Only eight out of the twelve lamps on each face are used in normal operation. They are rated at 30 volts 200 watts, but run at 25 volts 150 watts to provide increased service life. The other four lamps are 6 volts 28.5 watts and are used only as emergency lamps. Such emergencies may be loss of mains electric power or, far less likely, the complete failure of the main lamp banks. The four lamps in each of the two main banks are connected in series, which gives each unit the same intensity; however, if one lamp fails, all four in that bank go out. The four emergency lamps on each face are also connected in series in sets of two. Power is provided by emergency batteries. The emergency light is a lantern mounted on the balcony rail. Monitoring and general conditioning Fully automated since 1986, the light is monitored by the Northern Lighthouse Commissioners at their Northern Lighthouse Board Monitoring Centre. Initially after automatation an attendant from the Northern Board would visit the lighthouse on a fortnightly basis to test system procedures and the general physical condition of the building. However, since September 2004, the Retained Lighthouse Keeper of the Isle of Man has replaced the attendant and visits now on a monthly basis. In addition, lighthouse technicians visit the Douglas Head Light once or twice annually to modify and update the system equipment if necessary.

Built in 1852, it is believed to be the oldest surviving railroad station in the state. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history Situated on the west end of Northfield's Depot Square green, the Central Vermont Railway Depot was once part of a relatively large complex of buildings built by the Central Vermont Railroad, including the Northfield Wood Company and common railyard buildings. Today, many of these buildings still stand; some have been converted into small offices by modern companies (such as TDS Telecom), others are used as storage by a local hardware and lumber store, while many remain vacant. In the 1970s, the decline of industry in the area took its toll on the station, and it was forced to cease operation. After several years of increasing disrepair, the side wings were demolished. As of 2006, the two nearest rail stations still in operation are in Randolph to the south, and Montpelier to the north. Roxbury, a small village south of Northfield, had a rail station as well, which closed shortly after the Central Vermont Railway Depot. The depot building is currently occupied by a Merchant's Bank location. The depot is a two-story masonry structure, built out of brick laid in common bond, which rest on a cut stone foundation. It is covered by a gabled roof with unusually deep eaves () supported by decorative rafter ends. Windows are mainly double-hung sash, set in rectangular openings with granite sills and lintels. The window above the main entrance (facing the Depot Square oval) is a Palladian-style three-part window. The gable above the front facade is decorated with Stick style woodwork, as is that on the rear (track-facing) side. The depot was built in 1852, but underwent significant alteration in the late 1890s. At that time, side wings were removed, and the Victorian Stick style decorations were added. A canopy over the platform between the depot and the tracks was removed in the mid-20th century. with See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Vermont References External links *Site information from The National Park Service Railway stations on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont Railway stations in Vermont Former Central Vermont Railway stations Transportation buildings and structures in Washington County, Vermont Buildings and structures in Northfield, Vermont National Register of Historic Places in Washington County, Vermont 1852 establishments in Vermont Railway stations in the United States opened in 1852 ","title":"Central Vermont Railway Depot (Northfield, Vermont)"},{"id":"6438654","text":"Rigel is one of the brightest stars in the sky, usually the brightest star in the constellation Orion. It is frequently mentioned in works of fiction. The star Rigel Artist's conception showing the relative sizes of the Sun (Sol) and blue supergiant Rigel, 71 times larger. Rigel (Beta Orionis) is a luminous blue supergiant of spectral type B8 Iae, in the constellation Orion. The star is actually a visual binary, with the secondary component Rigel B itself being a spectroscopic binary that has never been resolved visually, and which taken as a single source is 500 times dimmer and over 2200 AU from its overwhelming companion Rigel A (\\"Rigel\\"). This irregular variable star is the most luminous in our local region of the Milky Way; at about 71 times the diameter of the Sun it would, if viewed from a hypothetical planet at a distance of 1 AU, subtend an angle of 35¬∞ in the sky‚Äîwhen rising or setting it would extend from the horizon almost halfway up the sky‚Äîand it would shine at a lethal magnitude of ‚àí38 (see graphic). There is no evidence that the Rigel system hosts any extrasolar planets. However, several creators of works of science fiction have chosen to populate it with an unusually large family of worlds (see The Stars My Destination by Alfred Bester, Demon Princes by Jack Vance, and Star Trek below). The star's name is a contraction of Ri«ßl «¶awza al-Yusra, this being Arabic for left foot of the central one. Another Arabic name is ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿ®ÿßÿ±, ri«ßl al-«ßabbƒÅr, that is, the foot of the great one. It figures prominently in the mythologies of Egypt, China, Japan, and Oceania. General uses of Rigel Rigel may be referred to in fictional works for its metaphorical (meta) or mythological (myth) associations, or else as a bright point of light in the sky of the Earth, but not as a location in space or the center of a planetary system: * Mardi, and a Voyage Thither (1849), novel by Herman Melville. In this, his third novel, Melville is comparing archipelagoes of stars to the scatterings of islands he has visited on his exploration of the south seas: And as in Orion, to some old king-astronomer, ‚Äî say, King of Rigel, or Betelguese, ‚Äî this Earth's four quarters show but four points afar'; so, seem they to terrestrial eyes, that broadly sweep the spheres. / And, as the sun, by influence divine, wheels through the Ecliptic; threading Cancer, Leo, Pisces, and Aquarius; so, by some mystic impulse am I moved, to this fleet progress, through the groups in white-reefed Mardi's zone. (meta) * Clarel (1876), epic poem written by Herman Melville. In this 18,000 line poem, the longest in American literature, Melville describes a pilgrimage to the Holy Land: When, afterward, in nature frank / Upon the terrace thrown at ease / Like magi of the old Chalda-a / Viewing Rigel and Betelguese / We breathed the balm-wind from Saba-a. (sky) * Ben-Hur (1880), novel by General Lew Wallace. Judah Ben-Hur returns to Jerusalem as the adopted \\"young Quintus Arrius\\", and has the chance to revenge himself against his erstwhile friend-turned-enemy, the tribune Messala, by defeating him in a great chariot race. He will race the four eager white Arabians of Sheik Ilderim, who are named after stars: Ha, Antares ‚Äî Aldebaran! Shall he not, O honest Rigel? and thou, Atair, king among coursers, shall he not beware of us? Ha, ha! good hearts. (myth) * The Old Man and the Sea (1952), novel by Ernest Hemingway. The Old Man Santiago sees Rigel at sunset off the coast of Cuba: It was dark now as it becomes dark quickly after the sun sets in September ... The first stars were out. He did not know the name of Rigel but he saw it and knew soon they would all be out and he would have all his distant friends. (sky) Specific uses of Rigel The following references refer to Rigel as a location in space or the center of a planetary system. Literature A William Blake original of \\"The Tyger\\", printed c. 1795. * T√©kumel (~1940‚Äì ), novels and games by M. A. R. Barker. Rigel is the home star of the ng√©kka, a delicate, six-legged riding beast (riding beasts are extremely rare on T√©kumel), thought to be mythological. * The Lensman Series (1934‚Äì48), novels by E. E. \\"Doc\\" Smith. The Lensman series takes place on many different worlds over a vast sweep of space. The ancient supercivilization of the Arisians, originators of the \\"lens\\", initiates a breeding program for potential godlike heroes, the Lensmen, on four worlds of high potential, including the Earth and Rigel IV‚Äîthe latter a hot, high- gravity world. \\"L2\\" (Second-Stage Lensman) Kimball Kinnison is the product of the program on Earth, and L2 Tregonsee is the Rigellian. Smith's work is strongly identified with the beginnings of US pulp science fiction as a separate marketing genre, and did much to define its essential territory, galactic space, featuring many planets such as those orbiting Rigel. The Lensman series is considered far superior to Smith's Skylark series. * Empire series (1945‚Äì1952), short story and three novels by Isaac Asimov set early in the history of the Galactic Empire that later dominated his overarching Foundation Series of novels. Rigel, the name of the star, is assumed by one of its planets in the Empire series. In the first millennium of the Galactic Era, this world's inhabitants developed a robot-based civilization that became so decadent and lazy that the effete Rigellians fell easy victim to the depredations of the warlord Moray. * The Stars My Destination (1956), classic science fiction novel (titled Tiger! Tiger! in the UK) written by Alfred Bester, and doubly inspired by Alexandre Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo and William Blake's poem \\"The Tyger\\" (see graphic). After his apotheosis in the burning cathedral, the legendary Gully Foyle teleports stark naked to the vicinity of several stars, including Rigel: \\"burning blue-white, five hundred and forty light years from earth, ten thousand times more luminous than the sun, a cauldron of energy circled by thirty-seven massive planets ...\\" The interstellar \\"jaunting\\" sequence is typical of Bester's signature pyrotechnics, his quick successions of hard, bright images, and mingled images of decay and new life. * Next of Kin (1959), novel by Eric Frank Russell. Private Leeming is every sergeant's worst nightmare: immune to military discipline and punishment, and given to random acts of insubordination. Thus when a mission to fly a prototype spaceship behind enemy lines comes up, he is the natural candidate to pilot the dangerous but potentially strategic spy mission‚Äîone from which he is unlikely to return alive. Once on the job, racks up visits to 72 planets before finally approaching Rigel, the home system of a humanoid, rubber-limbed, pop-eyed, and consistently \\"friendly\\" alien race who speak a language eerily similar to English ... (Compare \\"Hungry are the Damned\\" below.) * Adaptation (1960), novelette by Mack Reynolds appearing in Astounding Science Fiction. Humanity is obsessed with the goal of colonizing every single one of the galaxy's millions of earthlike worlds, and they know how to do it: On each even semi-habitable new planet, a colony of a mere few hundred brave souls is seeded; inevitably they quickly revert to barbarism; more often than not, after a standard thousand years, they somehow adapt and develop a civilization peculiarly suited to their strange new home. Such is the case for Rigel, whose planets Genoa and Texcoco are \\"all but unbelievably Earthlike. Almost all [the] flora and fauna have been adaptable. Certainly [our] race has been.\\" After the requisite millennium, protagonist Amschel Mayer is sent in to take charge as a godlike interloper, to mold the young societies as he sees fit ... Reynolds' Adaptation, like \\"most of his later works, is unashamedly didactic, although not doctrinaire.\\" (Reynolds was a lifelong socialist.) * Demon Princes (1964‚Äì1981), series of five novels written by Jack Vance. In Vance's Oikumene universe, Rigel is one of the three principal centers of human civilization (together with the Earth and Vega), the Rigel Concourse consisting of \\"twenty-six magnificent planets, most of them not only habitable but salubrious.\\" The system was discovered by interstellar explorer Sir Julian Hove, who provided its worlds with a stuffy and bombastic list of names culled from a pantheon of Victorian notables. The compendium was intercepted by one Roger Pilgham, a bored transmission clerk who substituted a far more fanciful schedule of names, which gained wide acceptance: :: Alphanor :: Barleycorn :: Chrysanthe :: Diogenes :: Elfland :: Fiame :: Goshen :: Hardacres :: Image :: Jezebel :: Krokinole :: Lyonesse :: Madagascar :: Nowhere :: Olliphane :: Pilgham :: Quinine :: Raratonga :: Somewhere :: Tantamount :: Unicorn :: Valisande :: Walpurgis :: Xion :: Ys :: Zacaranda : Notable locations in the Concourse include: ::* The Esplanade, facing the Thaumaturge Ocean at Avente on Alphanor, and Kirth Gersen's base of operations. ::* The Patch Engineering and Construction Company of Patris on Krokinole, where Gersen builds a faux monster, the dnazd, to the specifications and for the use of the Demon Prince Kokor Hekkus on the fantasy planet Thamber. ::* The Feritse Precision Instruments Company, at Sansontiana on Olliphane, where Gersen takes up the trail of the descrambling strip to Lugo Teehalt's locator monitor‚Äîa decoder that will reveal the whereabouts of a secret paradise world. The Milky Way is co-extensive with Isaac Asimov's immense Galactic Empire, but it properly contains Jack Vance's far smaller Oikumene. : \\"The first full-fleged modern planetary romance is therefore probably Jack Vance's ... [he] supplied sf writers with a model to exploit.\\" Vancian worlds of the Oikumene provide a rich environment together with off- world protagonists (In the case of the above locations: Kirth Gersen) whose need to travel across the planet provides a quest plot and a rationale for the lessons in anthropology and sociology so common to the form. * Night Train to Rigel (2005), the first novel in the Quadrail Series written by Timothy Zahn. Government agent Frank Compton is enlisted by the arachnoid operators of the eponymous intra-galactic rail system to investigate the possibility of a certain WMD being able to slip past their security barriers.

V. Larson. After the arrival of the Galactics, Earth has been incorporated into the Galactic Empire.

Film and television =Star Trek= An artist's concept of a planetary system with multiple planets. In the case of the Rigel system, the pictured planets might be Rigel II. Rigel III, Rigel IV, Rigel V, Rigel VII, and Rigel X (among the worlds named in this section). The items in this subsection all refer to works in the film, television, and print franchise originated by Gene Roddenberry. In the Star Trek universe, Rigel lends its name to at least twelve planets‚Äîa large number for a fictional universe‚Äîmany of which have been colonized by the Federation. Not all of these worlds are in the Beta Orionis planetary system (see graphic), and the name Rigel is used to describe at least one other star by some aliens. It is also unclear which, if any, of these bodies is home to the Rigellians, a reptilian race seen in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and distinct from the \\"one-l\\" Rigelians of Rigel V. Unlike many creators of works of science fiction, Star Trek eschews the use of common names for imaginary extrasolar worlds, instead consistently using (or misusing) the Roman numeral convention (Starname I, II, III, ...)‚Äîand never the modern astronomical convention (Starname b, c, d, ...). * \\"The Cage\\" (1965; first aired complete in 1988), original pilot episode of Star Trek: The Original Series written by Gene Roddenberry and directed by Robert Butler.

Captain Christopher Pike and a landing party from the USS Enterprise are attacked inside an apparently abandoned fortress on Rigel VII by native Kalar warriors. Three crew members are killed, and seven more are seriously injured.

(Compare Deneb: \\"I, Mudd\\".) * \\"Shore Leave\\" (1966), episode of Star Trek: The Original Series written by Theodore Sturgeon and directed by Robert Sparr. Back in his salad days, while enjoying youthful indiscretions on the resort planet Rigel II, Dr. McCoy had become well acquainted with a couple of scantily-clad ladies from a cabaret chorus line.

The subject of this diplomatic exercise is controversial: Shall the Coridan system, a prime but hotly contested natural source of dilithium crystals, be admitted to the Federation? The Rigelians of Rigel V (similar in physiology to the Vulcans but possessed of four or five genders) also want to join, and they finally become members in 2184. * \\"Wolf in the Fold\\" (1967), episode of Star Trek: The Original Series written by Robert Bloch and directed by Joseph Pevney. \\"Scotty\\" (Chief Engineer Scott) is accused of the brutal murder of several female acquaintances on the planet Argelius II‚Äîkillings actually carried out by an enigmatic and misogynistic entity that has cut an ancient and bloody swath across the galaxy, appearing variously through history as Jack the Ripper on the Earth, and as the woman- killer \\"Beratis\\" on the planet Rigel IV. * \\"The Passenger\\" (1993), episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine written by Morgan Gendel et al. and directed by Paul Lynch.

He was the star, inside-forward on the French team in the late 1950s. During the 1949‚Äì1950 season, he was the champion of Lorraine with his team, and was the top scorer in the league with 35 goals. At the 1958 World Cup, Piantoni was considered one of the best French players of his time. He was nicknamed Bout d'chou, meaning \\"Cabbage Tip\\", ranking as the sixth top scorer in the French Championship with a total of 203 goals in Division 1. Early life Roger Piantoni spent his youth in the mining town of La Mouri√®re, in the community of Piennes in Meurthe-et-Moselle. There he was known for playing with Thad√©e Cisowski in the local club, US Piennes. In 1948, with the youth team of Lorraine, he won the National Youth Cup by beating a youth team from the South-East in the championship. Henri Biancheri and Francis M√©ano were also on the South-Eastern team. He also played later against Raymond Kopaszewski who was on a northern youth team. The following year, he was accepted onto the French Junior team for the European championship. However, he performed poorly due to insufficient cardio. Fellow French national team player Michel Plantini later experienced the same disappointment. Club career Nancy Piantoni began his career at the age of 19 with FC Nancy during 1950‚Äì1951 season. In the first match of the championships, against RC Lens on 27 August 1950, he scored two goals. In his first season, he managed to become the top scorer of the championship with 27 goals. He scored five goals on the 28th day against Le Havre AC (6‚Äì1) and two quadruples (four goals) during the return match against RC Lens (4‚Äì2) and RC Strasbourg on the final day (5‚Äì1). In November 1952, in a friendly match against Ireland, he was selected to join the French national team for the first time. Over the course of seven seasons with FC Nancy, he scored a total of 92 goals. He and his teammates achieve some top performances in the Coupe de France. They reached the semi-finals of the season of 1950‚Äì1951, and the finals in 1953 (which was played on 31 May in Colombes.) FC Nancy, led by Jacques Favre, lost 2‚Äì1 against Lille OSC. A few months later, on 23 September 1953, FC Nancy beat Real Madrid 4‚Äì2 on their Chamartin field (later renamed Santiago Bernab√©u) in a friendly match. This match was remarkable as the official debuts of Piantoni for FC Nancy, and Alfredo Di St√©fano for Madrid. However, FC Nancy faced major financial problems. During the 1956‚Äì1957 season, they were demoted to the second division and the club was forced to let its best players go. Piantoni was transferred for 250,000 francs (25 million former francs before 1960, which is about $256,000 US) to the Stade de Reims which had just sold Raymond Kopa to Real Madrid. Reims At Stade de Reims, along with Just Fontaine and Jean Vincent, he won the France championship. In 1958, with the help of his teammates, they landed in the capital of Champagne. They quickly forget the departure of Raymond Kopa, the hero of the Stage Auguste-Delaune, who left a year earlier for Real Madrid. In March 1958, Piantoni recorded a quadruple against the regional rival, Sedan. On 1 May, Reims were French champions, giving Piantoni his first national trophy just a few weeks before the 1958 French Cup. He scored 17 goals in 32 games in the 1957‚Äì1958 season, then scored a further 20 goals the following season. It appeared to be the perfect match with Just Fontaine on the front of the attack, and they dominated the championship of France during the 1950s and the early 1960s. At that time, Piantoni and several of his teammates also participated in the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, where Albert Batteux (the coach, also his club coach, was beaten in the semifinal by Brazil). After his exploits in Sweden, Piantoni returned with the R√©mois but the defending championship team was struggling; it finished fourth with eight points at the end of the year. As an individual, he found success with 20 goals in 30 matches. On the European stage, the Reims reached their second European Cup final of the champions clubs in their history. In a final in Stuttgart on 3 June 1959, they lost to Real Madrid (0‚Äì2), in the European champion title game. A few weeks after the end of this remarkable European run, Piantoni and his teammates took the field for the 1959‚Äì1960 edition of the French championship. He scored 109 goals in 38 matches. This remarkable dominance was matched only by RC Paris, the only other club able to compete with them offensively. With two titles already for Piantoni, he scored 18 goals that season (ten fewer than Fontaine). The 1960‚Äì1961 season was less glorious for Reims Stadium, who finished seven points behind AS Monaco in May, due to the serious injury that hit their star forward Fontaine just a few months earlier. He had a double fracture in his leg, effectively ending his career. As a result of this injury, Fontaine ended discussions for a possible transfer of Piantoni to the Argentinian club of River Plate. Piantoni then became the team's leading scorer, and the country's best playmaker that season, eleven years after his title as top scorer with FC Nancy. In the international match up of France-Bulgaria, 11 October 1959, he was injured by Nikola Kovatchev, who broke his knee. The injury required several operations and made a lasting impact on the rest of his career. This recurring injury caused him to go through long periods of rehabilitation where he was unable to play. In his last three seasons in Reims, from 1961 to 1964, he played only 37 league games, achieving 23 goals. In 1961‚Äì1962, they won their sixth national title and, despite his physical problems, he achieved 16 goals in just 18 matches. He scored his last goal with the Champenois on 3 May 1964, during a home game defeat (1‚Äì4) against Valenciennes. Nice In 1964, Roger Piantoni joined OGC Nice, in the second division, where he played a full season. The Ni√ßois won the second division championship and gained their promotion in the 1st division for the following season, after which he announced his retirement. International career Roger Piantoni received his first selection on 16 November 1952, in a friendly match in Dublin between the French team and Ireland (1‚Äì1). Piantoni tied the score for French at the 67th minute mark. In 1954, he did not participate in the World Cup in Switzerland. Injured a few months earlier during a France-Italy, he was unable to recover in time. Selected for the 1958 World Cup, he was one of the French players who brought the team to the semifinals, losing to the Pele's Brazilian team (2‚Äì5). Teaming with Just Fontaine and Raymond Kopa, Piantoni played the first five games where he scored four goals, including the second in the semi-final against the Sele√ß√£o. Due to emergency surgery for appendicitis, he did not play during the game against Germany, whom they beat 6‚Äì3 to secure third place. He played his last match with Les Bleus on 28 September 1961, a qualifying match for the 1962 World Cup in Chile against Finland (5‚Äì1). In the 79th minute of play on a free kick, he scored the last goal of his international career. From 1952 to 1961, Piantoni played 37 matches under the blue jersey, scoring 18 goals. Post-playing career After leaving Nice he became coach of the club of Carpentras from 1967 to 1971. He was later a member of the Federal Council of the French Football Federation (FFF) from 29 August 1970 to 31 December 1988. He remained attached to the Lorraine and the club of Nancy. He also worked for several years as a commentator on football matches on Antenne 2 alongside Michel Drucker and Bernard P√®re. A tribune at the Stade Marcel Picot, where AS Nancy-Lorraine is, bears his name.

It is one of the most famous Czech castles and is on the summits of two basalt volcanic plugs. On the lower peak, , is the two-storey structure called Baba (Old Woman), and on the higher outcrop, , is the four-sided structure known as Panna (Maiden). The castle is a landmark in the countryside known as ƒåesk√Ω r√°j (Bohemian Paradise). History View of Panna Tower, Trosky Castle The castle was established by ƒåenƒõk of Vartenberk in the second half of the 14th century.Toma≈° Ehrenberger, The 88 Most Beautiful Castles, pg. 133, Kartografie Praha a.s., Two towers were constructed, one on top of each rock, and various residential buildings and outhouses were erected between them. Three rings of fortified walls protected the complex. After ƒåenƒõk's death the castle came into the possession of King Wenceslas IV, from whom it was acquired by Ota of Bergov, of the Bergov dynasty. Though Ota the Younger of Trosk was a zealous Catholic, it did not stop him raiding the monastery in Opatovice and stealing its famous treasure,Sabine Baring-Gould, Cliff Castles and Cave Dwellings of Europe, 1921, p. 139 which he is said to have hidden in Trosky Castle, supposedly in an underground cellar blocked by a huge boulder.Petr David, Vladim√≠r Soukup, Lubom√≠r ƒåech, Wonders of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, pg. 57, Euromedia Group (2004), No one could move the boulder, which was eventually covered by scree, permanently cutting off the way to the precious objects. During the Hussite wars Trosky was a center of the pro-Catholic sides. It is therefore not surprising that in all probability the castle was never completely conquered by the Hussites or any other enemies. As late as 1428, shortly after the castle burned down, it was under siege by Jan Kralovec, captain of the T√°borite Army. From 1438 onwards the robber knight Kry≈°tov ≈†ov of Helfenburg and his companion ≈†vejkar settled in it to tyrannize the villagers in the surrounding countryside, before the people of Zho≈ôelec and ≈Ωitavy (English G√∂rlitz and Zittau, members of the Lusatian League) banded together to capture them. Margareth of Bergov, the widow of the original owner Ota of Bergov, made Trosky into her residence by 1444. In 1468 the castle was property of William of Hasenburg who kept it until 1497. After that several noble families owned the castle, although its significance declined. In 1648, during the Thirty Years' War, it was burned down completely by the Imperial Army and left in ruins. In 1681 the enlightened Jesuit Bohuslav Balb√≠n visited it; possibly the first documented example of a trip, the sole purpose of which was to research a historical site or area. In the 19th century a greater degree of interest was shown and romantic modifications were made to the ruins of the castle. It was decided to create a staircase leading to the Panna tower. Work was begun in 1841‚Äì43, but was not completed.

She was one of the first members of Martha Graham's dance company. Gilmour's older half-brother was sculptor Isamu Noguchi. Early life Gilmour was born in 1912 in Yokohama, Japan. Her father was unknown. Her mother, L√©onie Gilmour, attended Bryn Mawr College and studied at the Sorbonne in Paris, then moved to New York City in the early 1900s to try to establish herself as a writer. In 1907, L√©onie traveled to Japan at the behest of Yone Noguchi, the father of Ailes' older half-brother, Isamu, who had been born in 1904. However, by the time L√©onie arrived in Tokyo, Yone was involved with a Japanese woman who had already borne the first of their nine children. L√©onie's circumstances in Japan were always precarious. Nevertheless, she chose to stay there, teaching to support herself and Isamu, while continuing to edit Yone's writing. When Ailes was born, L√©onie chose the name Ailes for her daughter from a poem Beauty's a Flower by Moira O'Neill, the pseudonym of Agnes Shakespeare Higginson. It is a striking coincidence that the words in that poem seemed to predict Ailes' career as a dancer. O'Neill wrote, \\"Ailes was a girl that stepped on two bare feet...\\" L√©onie, Isamu and Ailes lived together in Japan until 1918, when L√©onie sent Isamu back to the United States to attend a progressive school in Indiana. Young Ailes grew up in a Japanese style house that L√©onie had constructed in Chigasaki, a seaside town near Yokohama. Ailes had close Japanese childhood friends, spoke Japanese as well as English and identified with Japan before she returned to the United States in 1920, at age 8. When Ailes and her mother returned to America, they lived first in San Francisco and then moved to New York City. L√©onie was a great believer in progressive education and sent Ailes to the Ethical Culture Society elementary school, founded in 1876 by Felix Adler. L√©onie herself had attended the predecessor to the Ethical Culture Society elementary school when it was called the Workingman's School. For high school, L√©onie chose the Cherry Lawn School in Connecticut for her daughter. It was a boarding school that was known for its progressive, coeducational program. The director and founder of the school was Dr. Fred Goldfrank, who was related to one of the founders of the Ethical Culture Society. Ailes greatly enjoyed her time there and formed several friendships that she maintained for the rest of her life. In 1928, Gilmour was the literary editor of The Cherry Pit, the Cherry Lawn's student magazine. After she graduated from high school in 1929, she went on to the Neighborhood Playhouse to study dance and performing arts as a scholarship student. There she met the young Martha Graham and joined her new professional dance troupe. Gilmour told Marion Horosko that she introduced Graham to her half-brother, Noguchi, in 1929. Graham had a bust made of herself in bronze. Career During the Depression Era, dancers like Gilmour and artists like Noguchi struggled to find work. In 1932, when Radio City Music Hall opened, Gilmour performed at the debut with Graham's company. Their work, Choric Patterns, lasted on stage for just one week. Gilmour ruefully observed to Marion Horosko that Radio City Music Hall could succeed only when it became a movie theater with Rockettes. In the 1930s, Gilmour appeared on dance programs with dancer-choreographer Bill Matons. Matons was the director of the \\"experimental unit\\" of the New Dance League, which evolved from the Workers Dance League between 1931 and 1935. Bill Matons was to later become General Hershy Bar, an anti-war street theater character and publisher. Among the group's later-to-become-famous members were male dancer-choreographers like Jos√© Lim√≥n and Charles Weidman. In 1937, Ailes and Matons performed in a Works Progress Administration (WPA) recital at the Brooklyn Museum. In 1939, they were in Adelante, a WPA-sponsored Broadway musical. Also in 1937, Matons did the choreography for the Lenin Peace pageant at Madison Square Garden. In 1948, Gilmour married anthropologist Herbert J. Spinden. They had a son, Joseph. On April 16, 1993, Gilmour died in Santa Fe, New Mexico at the age of eighty-one. References  Further reading  * Noguchi, Isamu. A Sculptor's World. New York: Harper and Row, 1968.

It was written in 1999 in French and published in 2000. It was translated into English in 2002 by Linda Asher, for which she was awarded the Scott Moncrieff Prize the following year. Plot introduction Czech expatriate Irena, who has been living in France, decides to return to her home after twenty years. During the trip she meets, by chance, Josef, a fellow √©migr√© who was briefly her lover in Prague. The novel examines the feelings instigated by the return to a homeland which has ceased to be a home. In doing so, it reworks the Odyssean themes of homecoming. It paints a poignant picture of love and its manifestations, a recurring theme in Kundera's novels. The novel explores and centres around the way that people have selective memories as a precursor to ignorance. The concept of ignorance is presented as a two-fold phenomenon; in which ignorance can be a willing action that people participate in, such as avoiding unpleasant conversation topics or acting out. Yet the novel also explores the involuntary aspects of being ignorant, such as feigning ignorance of the past or avoiding the truth.

History The fortifications and towers made by the Luxembourg dynasty after 1350 Madonna of Veve≈ô√≠, the most influential painting of gothic art (c. 1350)  11th to 15th centuries  According to legend, the castle Veve≈ô√≠ (\\"squirrel\\" in Czech) was founded by P≈ôemyslid Duke Conrad of Brno in the middle of the 11th century, as a hunting lodge. Nevertheless, the first credible recorded mention about the castle is from the years 1213 and 1222, when King P≈ôemysl Otakar I used the fortified castle as a prison for rebellious peers. Initially, it was apparently a wooden or masonry residence situated near the Romanesque church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary west of the present compound. In the 1220s, a stone castle on the extremity of the rocky promontory behind a deep moat cut out of the rock started to grow. The so- called keep is the only structure which has remained well-preserved from this oldest building stage. King John of Bohemia pledged the castle to nobleman Jan of Vartemberk in 1311, but his son, Margrave of Moravia Charles (later Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV), received the property as a debt settlement in 1335. Charles¬¥ younger brother, Margrave Jan Jind≈ôich (John Henry), then took a fancy to Veve≈ô√≠ Castle. He was responsible for the building of its rear part with two towers and an outer ward. In the central area around the keep, he developed the main palace, which included a large hall and the Chapel of St. Procopius (later of St. Wenceslaus). The present appearance of the compound is the result of these building activities, giving the castle its basic silhouette of a medieval fortress. The castle was a military-civic centre around a manor until the Hussite Wars. During the Hussite wars, Emperor Sigismund positioned mercenary forces of his son-in-law, Albrecht of Austria, around the castle, but he later pledged it to local nobleman Petr Kutƒõj in 1424. The Hussites besieged the castle in vain during the years 1428‚Äì32. During the second half of the 15th century, the castle was rented by Przemyslaus II of Tƒõ≈°√≠n, who decided to reinforce the castle with the construction of surrounding walls. In 1468, King of Hungary and antiking of Bohemia Matthias Corvinus started his occupation of the castle. At the end of the 15th century, V√°clav of Ludanice acquired the castle and became the first representative of his noble family which resided here. But his mismanagement of expenses and debts resulted in the family's eventual sale of manor. Early Modern period During the years 1531-1537, Jan of Pern≈°tejn and Jan of Lip√° stayed at Veve≈ô√≠ Castle. In successive years, the castle changed hands quickly. In 1609, Zikmund von Tiefenbach acquired the castle by marriage. Rudolf von Tiefenbach, an older brother of Zikmund, was a Protestant at that time, yet he remained loyal to the Catholic Emperor (and later converted to Catholicism). On November 8, 1620, at the Battle of White Mountain, he and his regiment sided with the Imperial Army (i.e. against rebellious Bohemian Estates). As a reward for its loyalty to the Catholic emperors Tiefenbach family could keep the castle and adjacent manor even after the majority of Bohemian Protestant nobility was confiscated and expelled into exile. In 1645, the Swedish Army laid siege to Veve≈ô√≠ Castle, but their attack was unsuccessful, as the castle was well guarded and the defenders well armed. In 1653, Maria Eva Al≈æbƒõta of the Sternberg family (Rudolf of Tiefenbach's dowager) inherited the castle. In 1668, V√°clav Michal, Count of Althan, bought the castle and resided there in 1668‚Äì70. At the end of the 17th century, compound belonged to the House of Collalto. Later, when the House of Sinzendorf (1707‚Äì1804) replaced this family, an extensive reconstruction was realized, and since that time, the exterior structure of the castle has remained practically unchanged. In 1742, the Prussian Army, having gained entry by the treachery of the castle steward, pillaged the interior of the estate.  19th and early 20th centuries  Veve≈ô√≠ Castle in the mid-19th century At the beginning of the 19th century, an industrial magnate, Vil√©m Mundy, purchased the castle. Although he had earlier arrived in the area as a simple wayfaring traveler, he achieved prominence and wealth after establishing a cloth factory in 1780 and then successfully managing his trade. In essence, he worked his way up until he could own Veve≈ô√≠ Castle. In 1830, a Swedish √©migr√©, Prince Gustavus Wasa, son of the deposed and exiled King of Sweden, Gustav IV, bought the castle and systematically began to rebuild it as the representative seat of his family. This nobleman lived at the estate with his spouse, Princess Louisa. Nevertheless, he divorced in 1844, and the property went to a Greek banker, Baron Georgios Sinas. Before he died in 1856, Sinas divided his family possessions. His granddaughter Helena obtained Veve≈ô√≠ Castle, but at that time she was still a juvenile, so the property was administered by her father. Later, Helena married Prince Gregor Ypsilanti; she kept a pompous and very expensive court. In 1886, Ypsilanti died in Paris. Widow Helena sold the estate. In 1881, the castle had a new owner, Baron Maurice de Hirsch. During this period, he had extensive repairs and renovations completed, including a new iron water supply, roofs, and telephone connections to Obora and the manor house in the nearby town of Rosice. The castle chapel was removed in the process. He died in Hungary in 1896, at the age of 64. His widow Clara de Hirsch died three years later, on 1 April 1899. At that point, Maurice de Forest inherited his adoptive father's residence in Moravia, then part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.Emmelie de Forest is NOT a great-great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria , royalmusings, February 18, 2013 During Maurice de Forest's time as proprietor, Winston Churchill and his wife Clementine spent several days in Veve≈ô√≠ Castle during their honeymoon journey throughout Europe in 1908. Churchill had stayed there alone twice before. Maurice de Forest and his family resided at Veve≈ô√≠ Castle until 1925, when he sold it to the newly created Czechoslovak Republic (which included the territory of Moravia). He received ¬£100,000 from the Czech government.  WWII and after  Western part of the castle During World War II, the castle was occupied by the Wehrmacht (Germans set up barracks), and during this period area was extensively damaged, including shooting damage to the second floor of the so-called palace. After 1945, a permanent exposition was set up on the site. Although never refurbished to pre-war quality, the castle was still open to the public. In the 1950s, the castle was closed to the public and a school of forestry took over, doing additional damage. Starting in 1972, there was a disastrous project to turn the castle into an international conference center, which fortunately was only partly realized and stopped before more damage to the castl'e historical and artistic value could be done. After the political changes in 1989 the castle continued being neglected. In 1994, Veve≈ô√≠ Castle was again opened to the public, but in 1999, it was abruptly closed and allowed to fall into a state of disrepair during lengthy \\"property transfers\\". After several unsuccessful attempts to rent the castle for commercial use, the castle passed in September 1999 from the management of the Ministry of Education under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Culture and joined the portfolio of historic buildings managed by the National Heritage Institute in Brno. Thanks to the program to protect the architectural heritage of the Ministry of Culture and extraordinary subsidies from the state budget of the city of Brno, the South Moravian Region, and voluntary collections, the worst emergency conditions were stabilized and a number of noteworthy renovations and reconstructions carried out, primarily of the palace. These renovations included a large-scale rebuilding of the \\"loft\\" above the palace, and the great dining room with its notable frescoes. Since 2002, the castle is again open to the public, including guided tours of the palace. The complete restoration of all buildings, furniture, courtyards and parks will take many years. Description View of the castle and Dam Lake The castle is usually entered via the so-called Southern Gate/barbacan (). This originally Gothic gate was rebuilt in the late Renaissance style in 1626. Above the portals, there are coats of arms belonging to Zigmund of Tiefenbach and his two wives, Kate≈ôina of Lomnice and Bohunka of ≈Ωerotin. Leading from the Southern Gate to the palace is the castle bridge, mentioned as one of the first ferro-concrete structures in the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. It was built on the site of a gothic drawbridge and later a Baroque bridge decorated with the statues of four saints in 1896. From the bridge one proceeds through a passage through the palace with keep. On the left is the so-called Black Kitchen, recently restored, where several ovens and a dish-washing basin have been preserved. The keep around which the palace is built is the tallest and oldest of the ten currently visible towers of Veve≈ô√≠ Castle, built in the early 13th century as the primary deense element of the oldest building stage of the castle. The palace is the main residential castle building, created by connecting the keep and two medieval palaces. The former Gothic chapel of St. Prokopius in the palace, which originally extended vertically from the ground floor to the second, was replaced in the late 19th century with separate spaces on the ground floor and a library and administrative spaces on the second floor. A preliminary plan has been developed for the reconstruction of the chapel. Beyond the palace one proceeds through a courtyard, which was created in the early 19th century by pulling down two 13th-century royal palaces. Luckily, records remain of the appearance of these palaces. Beyond the courtyard lies the so-called English Wing, constructed in the second half of the 17th century in the corridor between the Gothic calls. The ground floor served to park horse carriages, while the first floor was used as an armory and later as a granary. The building stands in need of extensive and costly renovation. Yet further along is found the so-called Backyard Palace, erected in the 17th century with two vaulted rooms, one above the other. The renovation plans call for it to be made into a space for cultural events. At the southeastern corner of the castle stands the so-called Eastern Prismatic Tower, built in the 14th century to protect the castle area from the east. South of this tower archaeological remains have been uncovered of walls of a medieval Eastern Castle Palace, which probably dates from the late 15th century and was pulled down before the mid-17th century.

The first issue came out on 28 February 1939. In the beginning it was printed in the form of a newspaper and issued biweekly, on Tuesdays and Fridays. Nowadays it comes out weekly, on Fridays. One part of the magazine is comics, while the other parts contain articles about science, nature, history, art and interesting events, written to appeal to the broadest audiences. The magazine's famous slogan labels it as \\"Za sve od 7 do 107\\" (For everyone from 7 to 107).Yu4You.com: Politikin zabavnik: ƒåasopisi Politika a.d The slogan once said \\"For everyone from 7 to 77\\", but was changed after the editor received a letter from a reader saying he had recently turned 78 and asking whether he was still fit to read it. The magazine was awarded the Sretenje order of the Republic of Serbia. History Pre-war years (1939‚Äì1941) First editorship consisted of journalists from Politika, headed by Vladislav Ribnikar, Du≈°an Timotijeviƒá and ≈Ωivojin Vukadinoviƒá. They were among the enthusiasts who were gathering Serbian intellectual left wing during the late 1930s. They had the idea about making an amusing newspaper containing novels, short stories and comic strips. On 31 December 1938 Politika came out with an open competition for the name of new edition. Between 34,998 coupons that arrived, one fifth voted for the name Politikin Zabavnik (Politika's Entertainer) among other suggestions. The magazine's first issue was published on 28 February 1939. It was issued in the form of Berliner newspaper (31√ó47 cm). It had 12 pages printed in black and white. Four of them were printed with addition of red color and its undertones. The concept of Politikin Zabavnik was balanced relation between comics and texts, such as novels, stories and interesting facts. As comics editor Duda Timotijeviƒá was in charge of translation of American comic strips and Sunday strips. He gave Serbian names to many Disney's characters to reflect their characteristics.Projekat Rastko] Zdravko Zupan: Zlatno doba srpskog stripa Beside Disney's comic strips Politikin Zabavnik published comics such as: Jungle Jim, Ming Foo, Little Annie Rooney, The Lone Ranger, Red Ryder, Thimble Theatre, ', Brick Bradford, and King of the Royal Mounted. Domestic comic authors also had significant space: ƒêorƒëe Lobaƒçev (comics related to Serbian folklore ‚Äì Ba≈° ƒåelik and ƒåardak ni na nebu ni na zemlji), Moma Markoviƒá (Rista sportista ‚Äì adventures of Belgrade boys), Konstantin Kuznjecov (adaptation of Pushkin's tales in verse ‚Äì The Tale of the Golden Cockerel and The Tale of Tsar Saltan), and Sergej Solovjev (adaptation of R. L. Stevenson's Treasure Island). The main difference between Politikin Zabavnik and concurrent comic publishers, such as Mika Mi≈° and Mikijevo carstvo, was textual parts containing crosswords, novels, Ripley's Believe It or Not!, news from science to sport, and numerous short, interesting and edifying texts. Additionally it had exclusive rights on, in that time in Serbia, the extremely popular Walt Disney comics. Editor of textual parts was Bata Vukadinoviƒá. Politikin zabavnik featured novels of Edgar Allan Poe, Mark Twain, H. G. Wells and many other famous writers.Projekat Rastko] Zdravko Zupan i Slavko Draginƒçiƒá: Istorija jugoslovenskog stripa I Average magazine circulation came to 41,000 per issue, which was at the time a great number. But World War II stopped the publishing of the magazine. The last of the pre-war editions (No 220) came out on 4 April 1941, two days before the bombing of Belgrade. After-war years (1952‚Äì1967) After the war, the new communist regime banned comics.Projekat Rastko] Slobodan Ivkov: Mala istorija srpskog stripa Their explanation was that comics are a decadent product of capitalism. However, after the end of Soviet influence in Yugoslavia, and especially after the Informbiro period, cultural bondages started to loose. First it started with caricatures and animated movies, and later some comics acquiescently started to be published in different editions.Slobodan Ivkov: 60 godina stripa u Srbiji Seven years after World War II, Vladislav Ribnikar decided to re-establish the magazine. The first post-war issue came out on 5 January 1952. Editor in chief was Kosta Stepanoviƒá, and his first assistant Bogdan Popoviƒá, (he later also became editor). Allegedly, it was prearranged by a visit of Athens' representative of Walt Disney Company. He suggested to president Josip Broz Tito to re-establish comic publishing in Yugoslavia. Tito's reputed answer was: \\"Why not, I like Donald Duck\\".Zograf The fact is that Disney's characters had significant space in Politikin Zabavnik. Modern age (1968‚Äìpresent) The first day of 1968 was a historical date for the magazine. Nikola Lekiƒá, chief editor in that time, changed its form from newspaper to magazine format (25√ó33 cm), and it was now published in color. Another significant addition was a comic in the middle of the magazine. Before that, Politikin Zabavnik published only comic strips. The magazine now contained a complete episode of a comic separated into 2-3 parts. Starting from 1971, Politikin Zabavnik was also printed in the Latin alphabet and Slovenian,index and at its peak it reached a number of 330,000 copies per issue (1975).Ja≈°aTomiƒá.org.rs - Katastrofalna poplava u mestu Ja≈°a Tomiƒá op≈°tina Seƒçanj (BANAT) Printing of Slovenian Language edition stopped in 1989 after 843 numbers when sold circulation fell to 8000 copies, soon after that Latin alphabet version also stopped. In January 1988, Zabavnik changed the format again, becoming a little smaller (21√ó30 cm). Although it has been slightly redesigned several times since, it is still published in that format. In 2019 the Slovenian-language version was resurrected by the new publisher. Logo The logo of Politikin Zabavnik features Donald Duck as a newspaper seller. At the beginning of 1993, due to an embargo against FR Yugoslavia imposed by United Nations, Politikin Zabavnik had to stop publishing Disney's comic strips, and instead of Donald Duck just a silhouette of him appeared in the logo. After the Yugoslav wars Disney's characters returned to the magazine.RTS: Sedamdeseti roƒëendan \\"Politikinog zabavnika\\" Sections Every issue consists of recurring and periodical sections and other texts related to magazine content.

Music video When released, BET refused to play the video to \\"Shopping Bags (She Got from You)\\", claiming that De La Soul were no longer relevant to their audience. BET's actions outraged many, who felt that the television network was outright disrespecting one of hip hop's legendary groups. BET remained unyielding and in 2005 gave North Carolina group Little Brother, the same dubious honor, this time citing their reason for not playing the video to \\"Lovin' It\\" as it being \\"too intelligent for their audience\\". The network, however, relented upon this decision some several months afterwards. The music video starts with a reporter interviewing a woman with several shopping bags. The reporter asks her where she got the bags from. The woman points to her boyfriend, who shrugs. The music video then shows several scenes of women on shopping sprees while their partners fall unconscious after their credit cards are taken from them.

It is born from the homonym glacial lake, situated to the east of the Nevado de Longav√≠, a stratovolcano in the Andes of central Chile. Through its upper section it flows west of the Melado range, surrounded by high Andean mountains. In this first stage it receives several streams specially on its northern side. From the lake the water falls, creating an impressive cascade, to the area known as \\"Bajo de las L√°stimas\\"; (a translation would be Lowlands of Sorrow - the explanation is that in the area lies a trail for cattle which, at this section, is extremely difficult for the animals to negotiate). Down to the small village of Pejerrey the valley still sustains woods which are a transition to the ones located further south in Chile, with species such as the Chilean Oak (Nothofagus glauca), Array√°n (Luma apiculata), Coig√ºe (Nothofagus dombeyi), and others. Roads reach only up to the ‚ÄúLas √Ånimas‚Äù stream, making this valley a unique experience for trekking, following crystalline waters between woods and mountains. Further west the Achibueno receives as affluent the river Ancoa, near the Pan-American Highway (CH-5 Sur), and flows a few kilometres south of the city of Linares. In this area there is a magnificent railway bridge. The Achibueno is the most important tributary to the river Loncomilla.

Built in the 11th century, B√≠tov is one of the oldest and largest Moravian castles. A P≈ôemyslid fortified settlement originally stood on the site and included the Chapel of Our Lady (Kostel√≠k Panny Marie). The fort was rebuilt in the first half of the 13th century as an impregnable Gothic castle guarding the southern boundaries of the P≈ôemyslid lands. In the 14th century a new inner ward was built along with Late Gothic fortifications. The Lords of B√≠tov became the new owners of the castle and based themselves here for four centuries. They carried out further improvements to the defensive capabilities of the castle. B√≠tov finally underwent Baroque remodelling, and gained its present form at the beginning of the 19th century, when it passed into the hands of the Counts of Daun. The descendants of Marshal Daun, the famous military leader, rebuilt the castle in the spirit of the Romantic style. Between 1811 and 1845 the richly-decorated state rooms were created, on the basis of proposals of Anton Schuler. The culmination of the re-Gothicising work was the remodelling of the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin (kostel Nanebevzet√≠ Panny Marie) by Viennense architect Anton Rucker, who left the original Gothic furnishings. At the end of the 20th century, B√≠tov underwent extensive refurbishment. The structural arrangement of the castle through remodelling, which was carried out several times later on, is an example of the Czech Early Gothic castle architecture. The arrangement is highly intricate and leads in one direction towards the front moat, to which both the wedge-shaped round towers pointed. The outer tower, above the moat, was later merged with the body of the castle, while the other tower stands alone at the rear of the inner court.

Chenrezig is at the top. 210px Ch√∂ying Dorje (1604‚Äì1674) was the tenth Karmapa or head of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. Ch√∂ying Dorje was born in the kingdom of Golok, Amdo. At the age of eight, he was recognized by Shamar Mipan Ch√∂kyi Wangchuk, the sixth Shamarpa and received the complete Kagyu transmissions.https://www.karmapa.org/karma- kagyu/lives/10th-karmapa-choying-dorje/ During his life, Tibet faced inner instability as a pro-Kagyu king suppressed - against the will of the Karmapa - the Gelug school and forbade the search for the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. The regent of the Gelug asked G√ºshi Khan, the warrior king of the Khoshut Mongols, for help. The Mongolian army attacked Shigatse and forced many monasteries to convert to the Gelug school.Laird, Thomas. (2006). The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama, p. 165. Grove Press, New York. .Richardson, Hugh E. (1984). Tibet and its History. Second Edition, Revised and Updated, p. 42. Shambhala. Boston & London. .(pbk) The civil war became such that Ch√∂ying Dorje had to flee Tibet and he appointed Goshir Gyaltsab as the temporary regent. The Kagyu school was almost completely annihilated in Tsang province, however, it remained in the provinces of Amdo and Kham.  Exile During his exile (1648 to 1672), Ch√∂ying Dorje travelled extensively through Bhutan, Amdo and Kham in East Tibet, Burma and Nepal, founding monasteries along his route.https://www.karmapa.org/karma- kagyu/lives/10th-karmapa-choying-dorje/ Traveling through dangerous lands he often concealed his identity, wearing common clothes, and was at times robbed and reduced too begging for food in a region he didn't speak the dialect. He wrote books on various subjects, composed songs and made an enormous number of paintings and sculptures. Also, while in exile he returned his monks vows and had a family.https://treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Choying-Dorje/P1382  Family and children  It's likely when Karmapa was in the far southeast of Tibet for a period of twelve years, is when he took a consort. He fathered several sons and daughters. One of his sons, Norbu Zangpo, who was recognized as the Sixth Tsurpu Gyeltsab (c.1659-1698). Karmapa enthroned his 3 year old son Norbu Zangpo in a temple he helped build in Gyeltang with his bare hands. In 1667 the Karmapa brought him to Riknga Temple and performed novice ordination. In 1672 the Karmapa returned to central Tibet with a large entourage that included his wife, sons, and daughters. Most likely the main reason for returning was to arrange the installment of his son Norbu Zangpo at Tsurpu.https://treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Choying-Dorje/P1382  Return to Central Tibet  After twenty-four years of exile, the Kagyu school was no longer the dominant school of Tibetan Buddhism. In 1674 the 5th Dalai Lama met with Ch√∂ying Dorje at the Potala Palace, and the reconciliation was welcomed by all after the many conflicts and difficulties.Karmay, Samten C. (2005). \\"The Great Fifth\\", p. 2. Downloaded as a pdf file on 16 December 2007 from: Scene from Gautama Buddha‚Äôs life story by the Tenth Karmapa  Art  Within the Tibetan artistic heritage, Ch√∂ying Dorje is perhaps the most exceptional artist of all times. The various biographies agree that the 10th Karmapa was a talented painter and sculptor already at a young age. It is also repeatedly stated that he was from a young age especially fond of Indian statues from Kashmir. This explains why many of the statues made by the Tenth Karmapa ‚Äì regardless whether cast in metal or carved in ivory, wood, or conch shell, etc. ‚Äì are stylistically very close to brass statues from Kashmir and Swat. However, Ch√∂ying Dorje was not simply copying ancient Indian and Tibetan works. Just inspired, he rather created his own work of art ‚Äì albeit using ancient stylistic elements. As mentioned in his biographies, he had ample opportunity to study early statues during his recurring visits to the Jokhang temple in Lhasa. His activities as a painter were evidently influenced by the Chinese tradition, which also explains why Ch√∂ying Dorje painted many works on silk. Chinese influence in the works of Ch√∂ying Dorje has its origin in arhat paintings that he had seen in Tibet and copied several times. The Tenth Karmapa also encountered other Chinese silk paintings during his exile in Lijiang, where he stayed for several years at the court of the local ruler. Ch√∂ying Dorje also created paintings influenced by Kashmir and Western Tibetan styles.von Schroeder, Ulrich. Buddhist Sculptures in Tibet.

The Elbs persulfate oxidation Several reviews have been published. Reaction mechanism A reaction mechanism has been postulated which accounts for the observed para substitution featuring the tautomeric para carbanion of the starting phenolate ion: It begins with nucleophilic displacement on the peroxide oxygen of the peroxodisulfate (peroxydisulfate) ion, to give an intermediate sulfate group (3), which is then hydrolyzed to the hydroxyl group. The reaction is disadvantaged by low chemical yields with recovery of starting material and complete consumption of the persulfate.

It allowed the FDIC to borrow directly from the Treasury department and mandated that the FDIC resolve failed banks using the least costly method available. It also ordered the FDIC to assess insurance premiums according to risk and created new capital requirements. Prompt Corrective Action Title I, ¬ß 131(a), Prompt Corrective Action, mandates progressive penalties against banks that exhibit progressively deteriorating capital ratios. At the lower extreme, a critically undercapitalized Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-regulated institution (i.e., one with a ratio of total capital / assets below 2%) is required to be taken into receivership by the FDIC in order to minimize long- term losses to the FDIC. The motivation behind the law is to provide incentives for banks to address problems while they are still small enough to be manageable. Spong (2000, pages 90‚Äì95) summarizes the details (http://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/bankingregulation/RegsBook2000.pdf). In an interview on Bill Moyers Journal broadcast April 3, 2009, former bank regulator William K.

Foundation at the University of Regensburg. The topic of his lectures was \\"Sacralization and Secularization\\". Since November 2015 Joas is a member of the advisory board of the Federation of German Scientists (Vereinigung Deutscher Wissenschaftler e. V.). Research Hans Joas‚Äô research focuses on social philosophy and sociological theory, mainly American Pragmatism and Historicism; the sociology of religion and the sociology of war and violence; as well as value change in modern societies. The emergence/formation of values is a core theme of Hans Joas‚Äô work. He developed a theory of \\"Affirmative Genealogy\\" of values, especially with regard to human rights. According to Joas values originate in experiences of self-formation and self-transcendence. He developed a phenomenology of experiences of self-transcendence. Joas emphasizes that his account of the contingency of value-formation is not to be seen as a plea against the claims of a universalistic morality.

Bound up like a pocket-book or in a carrying case, Claude glasses were used by artists, travelers and connoisseurs of landscape and landscape painting. Claude glasses have the effect of reducing and simplifying the colour and tonal range of scenes and scenery to give them a painterly quality. The user would turn their back on the scene to observe the framed view through the tinted mirror‚Äîin a sort of pre-photographic lens‚Äîwhich added the picturesque aesthetic of a subtle gradation of tones. Man Holding a Claude Glass by 366x366px History Poet Thomas Gray's Journal of his Tour in the Lake District, published in 1775, popularized the use of the Claude mirror ‚Äì it is sometimes referred to as a \\"gray glass\\" around this time. On one sightseeing trip Gray was so intent on his glass that he fell backward into \\"a dirty lane\\" and broke his knuckles; he later remarked how he kept the glass open in his hand, enabling him to see \\"the sun set in all its glory\\". In his influential A Guide to the Lakes (1778) Thomas West explained \\"The person using it ought always to turn his back to the object that he views. It should be suspended by the upper part of the case ... holding it a little to the right or the left (as the position of the parts to be viewed require) and the face screened from the sun.\\" He recommended carrying two different mirrors: \\"one to manage reflections of great and near objects and a flatter glass for distant and small objects.\\" The Claude glass is named for Claude Lorrain, a 17th-century landscape painter, whose name in the late 18th century became synonymous with the picturesque aesthetic, although there is no indication he used or knew of it or anything similar. The Claude glass was supposed to help artists produce works of art similar to those of Lorrain. William Gilpin, the inventor of the picturesque ideal, advocated the use of a Claude glass saying, \\"they give the object of nature a soft, mellow tinge like the colouring of that Master\\". Gilpin mounted a mirror in his carriage, from where he could take in \\"a succession of high-coloured pictures ... continually gliding before the eye\\". Claude glasses were widely used by tourists and amateur artists, who quickly became the targets of satire. Hugh Sykes Davies (1909 ‚Äì 1984) observed their facing away from the object they wished to paint, commenting, \\"It is very typical of their attitude to Nature that such a position should be desirable.\\"Hugh Sykes Davies (1986). Wordsworth and the Worth of Words. p223 In the 20th century, architect Mary Colter included Claude glasses (dubbed \\"reflectoscopes\\") in her Desert View Watchtower for the use of visitors viewing the Grand Canyon.

As its name indicates, the unit was the first parachute infantry brigade formation in the British Army. Formed from three parachute battalions as well as support units and assigned to the 1st Airborne Division, the brigade first saw action in Operation Biting ‚Äì a raid on a German radar site at Bruneval on the French coast. They were then deployed in the Torch landings in Algeria, and the following Tunisia Campaign, where it fought as an independent unit. In North Africa each of the brigade's three parachute battalions took part in separate parachute assaults. The brigade then fought in the front line as normal infantry until the end of the campaign, during which they earned the nickname the \\"Red Devils\\". Following the Axis surrender in North Africa, when 1st Airborne Division arrived in Tunisia the brigade once more came under its command. The brigade's next mission was Operation Fustian, part of the Allied invasion of Sicily. This was also the British Army's first brigade-sized combat parachute jump. Because of casualties sustained in Sicily, the brigade was held in reserve for the division's next action, Operation Slapstick, an amphibious landing at Taranto in Italy. At the end of 1943, the brigade returned to England, in preparation for the invasion of North-West Europe. Not required during the Normandy landings, the brigade was next in action at the Battle of Arnhem, part of Operation Market Garden. Landing on the first day of the battle, the brigade objective was to seize the crossings over the River Rhine and hold them for forty-eight hours until relieved by the advancing XXX Corps, coming from the south. In the face of strong resistance elements, the brigade managed to secure the north end of the Arnhem road bridge. After holding out for four days, with their casualties growing and supplies exhausted they were forced to surrender. By this time the remainder of the brigade trying to fight through to the bridge had been almost destroyed and was no longer a viable fighting force. Reformed after the battle, the brigade took part in operations in Denmark at the end of the war and then in 1946 joined the 6th Airborne Division on internal security duties in Palestine. Post-war downsizing of the British Army reduced their airborne forces to a single brigade and led to the 1948 dissolution of 1st Parachute Brigade. Formation history Background Three of the first British paratroopers, June 1941. Impressed by the success of German airborne operations during the Battle of France, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill directed the War Office to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops.Otway, p.21 On 22 June 1940, No. 2 Commando was redeployed to parachute duties and on 21 November re-designated the 11th Special Air Service Battalion (later the 1st Parachute Battalion), with both a parachute and glider wing,Shortt and McBride, p.4Moreman, p.91 the men of which took part in the first British airborne operation, Operation Colossus, on 10 February 1941.Guard, p.218 The success of the raid prompted the War Office to expand the airborne forces, setting up the Airborne Forces Depot and Battle School in Derbyshire in April 1942, and creating the Parachute Regiment as well as converting several infantry battalions into airborne battalions in August 1942.Harclerode, p.218 This resulted in the formation of the 1st Airborne Division with the 1st Parachute Brigade and the 1st Airlanding Brigade. Its commander Major-General Frederick Arthur Montague Boy Browning, expressed his opinion that the fledgling force must not be sacrificed in \\"penny packets\\" and urged the formation of further brigades.Ferguson, pp.7‚Äì8 All parachute forces had to undergo a twelve-day parachute training course at No. 1 Parachute Training School, RAF Ringway. Initial parachute jumps were from a converted barrage balloon and finished with five jumps from an aircraft. Anyone failing to complete a descent was returned to his old unit. Those men who successfully completed the parachute course were presented with their maroon beret and parachute wings.Guard, p.224Guard, p.226 Airborne soldiers were expected to fight against superior numbers of the enemy armed with heavy weapons, including artillery and tanks. Training was as a result designed to encourage a spirit of self-discipline, self-reliance and aggressiveness. Emphasis was given to physical fitness, marksmanship and fieldcraft.Guard, p.225 A large part of the training regime consisted of assault courses and route marching while military exercises included capturing and holding airborne bridgeheads, road or rail bridges and coastal fortifications. At the end of most exercises, the battalions would march back to their barracks. An ability to cover long distances at speed was also expected: airborne platoons were required to cover a distance of in twenty-four hours, and battalions . This ability was demonstrated in April 1945. When the 3rd Parachute Brigade advanced in twenty- four hours, which included eighteen hours of close-quarters fighting. In the same month the 5th Parachute Brigade marched in seventy-two hours, during which they also carried out two night time assaults. Formation Parachute troops jumping from an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley near Windsor in England. Brigadier Richard N. Gale, who would later command the 6th Airborne Division, took command of the 1st Parachute Brigade on its formation in September 1941.Ferguson, p.6 A triangular brigade formation with three battalions, Gale decided that rather than dividing the 11th Special Air Service Battalion among the brigade's battalions, he would keep the already trained unit together.Tugwell, p.125 On 15 September it was renamed the 1st Parachute Battalion, which, together with the newly raised 2nd and 3rd Parachute Battalions, now formed the 1st Parachute Brigade. These battalions were formed from volunteers aged between twenty-two and thirty-two years of age. Only men in infantry units were selected and only ten men from any one unit were allowed to leave. Early in 1942 the brigade was joined by the 4th Parachute Battalion, the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance, and the 1st (Parachute) Squadron, Royal Engineers (RE).Saunders, p.110 The 4th Parachute Battalion left the brigade in July to become the first battalion in the 2nd Parachute Brigade.Ferguson, p.8 By 1944 the brigade had increased in size and now comprised the 1st, 2nd, 3rd Parachute battalions, the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance and the 1st (Parachute) Squadron Royal Engineers (RE) as well as the 3rd (Airlanding) Light Battery Royal Artillery (RA) with 75 mm howitzers, 1st (Airlanding) Anti-Tank Battery RA with 6 pounder and 17 pounder guns along with a Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) detachment.Urquhart, p.224 After the war the brigade comprised the 1st, 2nd, 17th Parachute Battalions and the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance. The 3rd Parachute Battalion had left to join the 3rd Parachute Brigade, replacing the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion, who had returned to Canada at the cessation of hostilities. The 1st Airborne Division was disbanded in November 1945, and the brigade assigned to the 6th Airborne Division in Palestine.Ferguson, p.46 In 1946 the 17th Parachute Battalion amalgamated with the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion retaining the number of the senior unit. The brigade formation changed again in 1948. Further amalgamations and the general reduction in the post war British Army resulted in the brigade being formed from the 1st Parachute Battalion, the amalgamated 2nd/3rd Parachute Battalion and the amalgamated 8th/9th Parachute Battalion. By July 1948 the 6th Airborne Division had been withdrawn to England and disbanded, leaving the 2nd Parachute Brigade as the only regular British Army parachute formation. Operational history Bruneval The Bruneval raid or Operation Biting in February 1942 was one of the first missions planned by Combined Operations Headquarters that used all three of the British Armed Forces. An attacking force from 'C' Company, 2nd Parachute Battalion would be parachuted into France by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and later evacuated by the Royal Navy.Reynolds, p.21 Their objective was a German W√ºrzburg radar station on the coast of France, which British scientists wanted to examine.Reynolds, p.20 2nd Parachute Battalion returning from the Bruneval raid. On 27 February, in ideal tide and weather conditions, the raid was commanded by Major John D. Frost. A group of forty men would attack machine- guns on the cliffs overlooking the evacuation beach and then advance to Bruneval village. Another fifty-five men in an assault group would attack the radar station and forty men would set up a blocking position to prevent German reinforcements reaching the radar site.Reynolds, pp.23‚Äì24 The parachute drop was mostly successful with half of the first group missing the drop zone (DZ) by . After capturing the radar and other installations, the assault group dismantled the equipment then withdrew towards the beach. They were intercepted en route by the cliff machine guns which had not yet been cleared and suffered some casualties. When the delayed first group arrived, they managed to neutralize the enemy machine guns and by 02:15 the company had mustered on the beach to wait for the navy. Despite some initial problems caused by a lack of experience in combined operations, the troops were successfully evacuated with losses of three men killed and seven wounded.Tugwell, pp.126‚Äì127 The success of the Bruneval raid was reported in the British media for several weeksHarclerode, p. 214 while Winston Churchill, who had taken a personal interest in the raid, assembled the War Cabinet on 3 March to hear from Major Frost and several other officers who had taken part. On 15 May 1942 a special supplement to the London Gazette carried the announcement of nineteen decorations for the mission, including a Military Cross for Frost. North Africa In November 1942, the brigade now commanded by Brigadier Edwin Flavell, was detached from 1st Airborne Division, to take part in Operation Torch, the Allied landings in French North Africa.Ferguson, p.9 On 11 November, the first major British parachute landing was made by the 3rd Parachute Battalion, which without its 'A' Company, flew from England via Gibraltar in a fleet of American piloted Douglas Dakotas.Reynolds, p.30 Their objective, the airfield at Bone, turned out to be deserted and was secured with no opposition. No. 6 Commando and a flight of RAF Spitfires reinforced the battalion later the same day.Ferguson, p.10 The following day the rest of the brigade who had travelled by sea arrived at Algiers. During the next airborne mission on 16 November, the 1st Parachute Battalion secured an important road junction near Souk el Arba, west of Tunis then the next day ambushed a German convoy and were involved in several small battles. The Commanding Officer (CO) Lieutenant Colonel James Hill was wounded attacking an Italian position and replaced by his second-in-command, Alastair Pearson. British Paratroops in North Africa. On 29 November the 2nd Parachute Battalion, now commanded by John Frost, parachuted onto an airfield at Depienne, south of Tunis. The airfield was deserted so Frost marched the battalion to a second airfield at Oudna. Due to postponement of their advance, the First Army did not relieve the battalion as planned and instead it became trapped behind the German lines, where Frost was informed by radio that they had been written off. After ambushing an advancing German formation, the battalion were attacked by a second German unit and surrounded. On 1 December the Germans attacked with infantry, armour and artillery, almost wiping out 'C' Company and causing heavy casualties in the rest of the battalion.Reynolds, p.32 Frost ordered the battalion to disperse into company groups and head for the Allied lines. On 3 December, the surviving 180 men reached safety at Majaz al Bab.Reynolds, p.33 With no more opportunities for parachute operations, the brigade fought in the front line as normal infantry. In February they held the right flank of the Allied line at Bou Arada and on the night of 2/3 February, the 1st Battalion, along with a French Foreign Legion unit, captured the Jebel Mansour heights and were then subjected to constant shelling and infantry attacks. After three days without relief, their almost ammunition expended, and having suffered 200 casualties, they were forced to withdraw.Reynolds, pp.33‚Äì34 This was followed by the brigade fighting two fierce engagements at Tamera and checking the German offensive of Operation Ochsenkopf. When the Allied advance began again after the winter rains, the brigade was assigned to the force tasked with capturing Bizerta on 17 March.Reynolds, p.34 The remaining Axis forces surrendered on 13 May 1943 bringing the Tunisian campaign to an end with a cost to the 1st Parachute Brigade of 1,700 killed, wounded or missing. They had nevertheless proved themselves in combat and been nicknamed the Red Devils by the German forces they had fought against. Sicily jeep being loaded into a Waco Hadrian glider. While the Horsa glider could accommodate two jeeps or a jeep and gun or trailer, the Waco could only take one of each. Immediately before the Axis surrender in April 1943, the 1st Airborne Division, now commanded by Major-General George F. Hopkinson, arrived in North Africa, and the 1st Parachute Brigade once again came under their command for further operations in Sicily. The invasion of Sicily was to be carried out by General Bernard Montgomery's Eighth Army landing in the east and Lieutenant General George S. Patton's U.S. Seventh Army coming ashore in the west. These seaborne landings were to be supported by airborne assaults whereby the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division would support the Americans and the 1st Airborne Division the British. The British airborne assault was divided into brigade-sized operations: Operation Ladbroke by the 1st Airlanding Brigade took place on the night of 9/10 July, and Operation Fustian by the 1st Parachute Brigade on the night of 13/14 July. A third operation to drop 2nd Parachute Brigade beside Augusta on the night of 10/11 July (Operation Glutton) was cancelled.Reynolds, p.36 Now under the command of Brigadier Gerald Lathbury,Tugwell, p.156 1st Parachute Brigade's objective in Sicily was the Primosole bridge across the Simeto River, south of Catania,Tugwell, p.159 the only crossing point that gave the Eighth Army access to the Catania plain.Reynolds, p.37 Once they had captured the bridge, the brigade were to hold out until relieved by Major- General Sidney C. Kirkman's 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, reinforced by the 4th Armoured Brigade advancing from the landing beaches.Reynolds, p.47 Paratroops of the brigade would land on four DZs and the gliders at two landing zones (LZ). The 1st Parachute Battalion was divided into two groups that would land at DZs on both sides of the river and thereafter attack the bridge from both sides simultaneously‚Äì3rd Parachute Battalion would land on their own DZ north of the bridge and secure the high ground, while the 2nd Parachute Battalion did the same in the south. At 19:30 on 12 July 1943 the brigade took off from North AfricaCole, p.45 Consisting of 105 Dakotas, eight of them towing Waco gliders and 11 Albemarles towing Horsa gliders, the gliders amongst other things transported the twelve anti-tank guns of the 1st (Airlanding) Anti-Tank Battery.Tugwell, p.162 The brigade's first casualties occurred while they were still en route, when two Dakotas were shot down flying over an Allied convoy with another nine damaged and forced to turn back. When they reached the Sicilian coast, Axis anti-aircraft fire shot down thirty-seven and a further ten were damaged and forced to abort their mission. Of the surviving aircraft, only thirty-nine managed to drop their paratroops within of the correct DZ. Only four gliders arrived intact and those not shot down en route were destroyed while attempting to land.Tugwell, p.164 Despite these setbacks, the 250 surviving men of the 1st Parachute Battalion captured the bridge intact. The battalion commander, 28-year old Lieutenant Colonel Pearson, ordered his men to dig in on the north side of the river. Their only support weapons were three anti-tank guns, two 3 inch mortars and a Vickers machine gun. As they dug in, the men removed the demolition charges from the bridge such that even if they were forced off the bridge it could not be immediately destroyed. The brigade objective Primosole Bridge. Unknown to the brigade, units of the German 1st Parachute Division had parachuted onto Catania airfield to reinforce the Italians guarding the bridge and quickly moved to regain the crossing.Ferguson, p.12 The German paratroops attacked at dawn. The defenders at the bridge held out all day against infantry, armour and attacks by aircraft.Tugwell, p.165 South of the bridge, the 2nd Parachute Battalion also under attack, were able to call on naval gunfire support from the 6 inch guns of the British cruiser , which stopped an assault that was about to overrun their position. The men from the 1st and 3rd Battalions, although initially forced across the river, still held the southern bank until dark when they withdrew to the 2nd Battalion's position. To the south, the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, in the face of strong German resistance, had stopped for the night south of the 2nd Battalion. Gunfire was heard just south of the brigade position on the following morning whereupon Brigadier Lathbury sent out a patrol to investigate and they discovered it was from British guns. The leading elements of the 50th Division had finally made contact with the brigade. After two days fighting, the brigade's 4th Armoured and the 9th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry recaptured the bridge. Operations Ladbroke and Fustian had cost the British 1st Airborne Division 454 dead, 240 wounded and 102 missing. England British paratroopers adjust their parachute harnesses during a large-scale airborne forces exercise in England, 22 April 1944. The brigade returned to England in late 1943 and trained for operations in North-West Europe under the supervision of I Airborne Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Frederick Browning. Although they were not scheduled to take part in the Normandy landings, Operation Wastage was a contingency plan drawn up whereby all the 1st Airborne Division would be parachuted in to support any of the five invasion beaches if delays were experienced.Peters and Buist, p.10 In early September the brigade prepared for Operation Comet, during which the 1st Airborne Division's three brigades were to land in the Netherlands and capture three river crossings. The first of these was the bridge over the River Waal at Nijmegen, the second the bridge over the River Maas at Grave and finally the bridge over the River Rhine at Arnhem.Peters and Buist, p.28 The objective of the British 1st Parachute Brigade would be the bridge at Arnhem.Peters and Buist, p.31 Planning for Comet was well advanced when on 10 September the mission was cancelled. Instead, a new operation was proposed with the same objectives as Comet but to be carried out by three divisions of the First Allied Airborne Army, the British 1st and U.S. 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions.Peters and Buist, pp.40‚Äì41 Arnhem Map of the Arnhem area showing the planned drop and landing zones. Landings by the 1st Allied Airborne Army's three divisions began in the Netherlands on 17 September 1944. Although the allocation of aircraft for each division was roughly similar, the 101st Airborne Division landing at Nijmegen would use only one lift. The 82nd Airborne Division at Grave required two lifts while the 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem would need three lifts. Whereas the two American divisions delivered at least three quarters of their infantry in their first lift, the 1st Airborne's similar drop used only half its capacity for infantry and the remainder to deliver vehicles and artillery.Tugwell, p.241 The 1st Airborne Division had the required airlift capacity to deliver all three parachute brigades with their glider-borne anti-tank weapons or two of the parachute brigades and the airlanding brigade on day one. Instead, the vast majority of the division's vehicles and heavy equipment, plus the 1st Parachute Brigade, most of the 1st Airlanding Brigade and divisional troops were to be on the first lift, with the rest to follow the next day. Following the first lift, the airlanding brigade would remain at the landing grounds to defend them for the following day's lifts, while the parachute brigade set out alone to capture the bridges and ferry crossing on the River Rhine.Urquhart, pp.5‚Äì10 Planes carrying the brigade left England at around 09:45 and arrived over DZ 'X' at 13:00.Reynolds, p.65 After an uneventful landing the brigade, once organised, set off for Arnhem. The 2nd Parachute Battalion followed a southern route along the river Rhine, to the north 3rd Parachute Battalion took the Heelsum- Arnhem road through Oosterbeek, while the 1st Parachute Battalion initially remained in reserve at brigade headquarters.Reynolds, p.66 The 2nd Battalion, with 'A' Company leading, came under sporadic fire from pockets of German troops. 'C' Company were directed to capture the Arnhem railway bridge, but it was blown up just as they arrived.Reynolds, p.67 Pushing ahead, 'A' Company came under fire from German armoured cars and discovered that the central span of the pontoon bridge was missing.Reynolds, pp.68‚Äì69 Entering Arnhem as night fell, the leading battalion elements reached the main road bridge at 21:00.Reynolds, p.69 Having secured the northern end of the bridge, attempts to capture the southern end were repulsed and the battalion started to fortify the houses and dig in. Following behind, other units of the brigade started to arrive, including a troop of guns from 1st (Airlanding) Anti-Tank Battery, brigade headquarters without the brigadier, part of the 1st Airborne Reconnaissance Squadron, and detachments of Royal Engineers and Royal Army Service Corps men. In total about 500 men were now at the bridge.Urquhart, p.50 A lucky break allowed 3rd Battalion to ambush the staff car carrying Generalmajor Friedrich Kussin, the German commandant of Arnhem, and kill him and his driver. Nevertheless, most of the battalion had been stopped by the Germans in Oosterbeek while 'C' Company had entered Arnhem but were halted on the road leading to the bridge.Urquhart, pp.52‚Äì53 At 15:30 the 1st Parachute Battalion were released from the reserve and directed along the Ede-Arnhem road. Here they first encountered German armoured vehicles and a column of five tanks and fifteen half-tracks, which were engaged by the battalion. They continued fighting their way forward, and by morning had reached the outskirts of Arnhem. By this time around a quarter of the battalion had been killed, wounded or were missing.Urquhart, p.53 Before this, at nightfall, Brigadier Lathbury had contacted Lieutenant-Colonel Frost in command at the bridge and informed him the brigade would stay put during the night and attempt to reach him in the morning.Urquhart, p.52 The bridge on the morning of Monday 18. Wreckage from that morning's battle litters the northern end. At dawn on the second day, the defenders on the bridge saw a small convoy of trucks approaching at some speed from the south, which at first they misidentified as the British XXX Corps. That they were enemy trucks did not become apparent until they were on the bridge whereupon the defenders opened fire and destroyed the convoy.Peters and Buist, p.124 Soon afterwards, German infantry and armour approached the bridge from the east. One tank reached the space under the bridge before it was destroyed by one of the 6 pounder anti-tank guns. At 09:00, thirty armoured cars, half-tracks and trucks from the 9th SS Panzer Division attempted to rush the bridge from the south. The first five armoured cars, using the wrecks of the dawn convoy as cover and with the element of surprise, managed to cross unscathed. The rest of the force was engaged and twelve of their vehicles destroyed with the survivors returning to the southern bank.Peters and Buist, pp.125‚Äì126 All day long, the force at the bridge came under fire from mortars and anti-aircraft guns positioned south of the river and were subject to probing infantry and armour attacks.Peters and Buist, p.126 On the outskirts of Arnhem, 1st Battalion, which had been joined by Headquarters Company, 3rd Battalion, unsuccessfully attempted to fight through to the bridge then moved south in an attempt to flank the German line. They eventually ended up beside the river,Peters and Buist, p.127 whereafter 3rd Battalion advanced along the bank until daylight revealed their position to the Germans. Divisional commander Major-General Roy Urquhart and Brigadier Lathbury accompanied 3rd Battalion until Lathbury was shot and wounded. Due to his injuries, they were unable to move him and he was left in the care of a Dutch family.Urquhart, p.64 The 1st and 3rd Battalions spent all day trying to force a way through to the bridge. By nightfall they had failed and the strength of both battalions was reduced to around 100 men. Another attempt to reach the bridge began at 03:45 on the third day, 19 September when the 1st and 3rd Battalions were joined by the 11th Parachute Battalion and the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment.Peters and Buist, pp.162‚Äì163 By dawn, under intense fire from the German defenders, the attack had faltered whereupon the 11th Parachute Battalion, until then held in reserve, was ordered to carry out a left flanking assault on the German line. This last attempt to reach the defenders at the bridge was subsequently stopped on the orders of General Urquhart when he realised the futility of the battle.Peters and Buist, p.164 By this time the 1st Parachute Battalion had been reduced to forty men and the 3rd Parachute Battalion to around the same number.Peters and Buist, p.165 With no word from the division or brigade Lieutenant-Colonel Frost assumed command of the brigade units at the bridge. With their casualties mounting and supplies of food and ammunition running low, a request for the force to surrender was rejected by Frost, who decided they would fight on.Peters and Buist, p.166 British paratroopers during the Battle of Arnhem. By day four, 20 September, the brigade still holding out at the bridge had been split into two groups during the night by the Germans who had managed to infiltrate close enough to separate them into positions east and west of the bridge road. Any movement was subjected to machine-gun and sniper fire and they were under almost constant mortar and artillery attack. Added to this were probes by tanks and self propelled guns, which approached the defenders' buildings and opened fire at point blank range. The brigade, out of anti-tank ammunition, could do nothing to stop them in the east, but the 6 pounders in the west still proved an effective deterrent. During the day, Lieutenant John Grayburn of the 2nd Battalion was killed and later posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery during the fighting at the bridge. That morning, communications with 1st Airborne Division were established and Frost, on asking for reinforcements and supplies, was informed that the division was surrounded at Oosterbeek and the brigade was on their own.Peters and Buist, p.197 Frost was later wounded and command of the brigade assumed by Major Frederick Gough of the reconnaissance squadron.Peters and Buist, p.212 By midday the brigade position was untenable and the last defenders were withdrawn into what had been the Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion's position. By nightfall they were still holding out, and in the darkness some men tried unsuccessfully to break out. At dawn on day five, what was left of the brigade was forced to surrender.Peters and Buist, p.213 Post war By early May 1945, the 1st Parachute Brigade had been brought up to strength, albeit mainly with inexperienced replacements and the survivors of the 4th Parachute Brigade, which had been disbanded.Middlebrook, p.445 On 4 May, the brigade was detached from 1st Airborne Division and 1st Parachute Battalion transported to Denmark for occupation duties while the rest of the brigade remained in Britain as a reserve formation.Otway, p.324 Without the brigade, the 1st Airborne Division deployed to Norway, but on their return were disbanded on 15 November 1945.Otway, pp.329‚Äì330 The remaining airborne division, the 6th, went to serve in Palestine. On 8 April 1946, the brigade, now under command of Brigadier Hugh Bellamy, arrived in Palestine where it deployed in an internal security role. They replaced the 6th Airlanding Brigade, which was reformed as a normal infantry formation.Cole, p.204 Disbandment of the last brigade was overseen by its final commander Brigadier James Hill. Except for the three battalions of the 2nd Parachute Brigade in England, the remainder of the British airborne forces were disbanded.Cole, p.209 Between March and May 1948, the 6th Airborne Division was dismantled, with the men leaving for England to be demobbed. The 1st Parachute Battalion, along with divisional headquarters, were the last airborne units to leave Palestine, three days after the British mandate ended on 18 May.Cole, p.210 After the brigade had been disbanded in June 1948, its battalions were reformed, by renumbering those in the 2nd Parachute Brigade. The 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion became the 2nd Parachute Battalion, the 4th/6th Parachute Battalion the 1st Parachute Battalion, and the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion the 3rd Parachute Battalion. Finally, in July 1948, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was renumbered the 16th Parachute Brigade Group, taking its one and six numbers from the two wartime divisions.Ferguson, p.34 Notes ;Footnotes ;Citations References     Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom) 1 Parachute UK Parachute Brigade Military units and formations established in 1941 Military units and formations disestablished in 1948 Airborne infantry brigades of the United Kingdom ","title":"1st Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)"},{"id":"6439162","text":"Amwell may refer to: Places *In England ** Amwell, Hertfordshire in England ** Amwell, London, an urban village and part of the district of Clerkenwell *In the United States ** Amwell Township, Pennsylvania ** Amwell Township, New Jersey, since subdivided into: ***West Amwell Township, New Jersey ***East Amwell Township, New Jersey ****Amwell, New Jersey, an unincorporated community on the eastern border of East Amwell Township ** Amwell Valley, a valley in Hunterdon County, New Jersey Other uses * Amwell Valley Vineyards, the former name for Old York Cellars, a winery in the Amwell Valley of New Jersey * Amwell, a nickname for the company American Well and the name of its mobile app ","title":"Amwell"},{"id":"6439176","text":"right Yeshe Dorje (1676‚Äì1702) was the eleventh Gyalwa Karmapa, head of the Kagyu School of Tibetan Buddhism.

Construction The Directors of the Llandudno Pier Company had successfully opened the new pier in 1878 and were now looking to expand their business to take advantage of Llandudno's growing popularity as a seaside resort. The existing sundeck pavilion at the end of the pier was proving inadequate to cope with the demand for musical recitals, so the decision was taken to build a bigger and better pavilion near the promenade entrance to the pier extension then under construction. Work started in 1881 and the plans called for a 2,000-seat three-storey structure, to be built in the typically flamboyant Victorian style, complete with a superbly detailed cast-iron veranda, running the length of the entire seaward side of the building. The pavilion was unusual in that it had two main entrances, the first from the pier entering at Stall level and the another on Happy Valley Road, which emerged onto the Balcony. More unusually, the pavilion basement housed what was then the largest indoor swimming pool in Britain. Unfortunately for the pier company, problems with water quality meant that this novel idea did not prove successful, and the pool was filled in shortly afterwards. The pavilion was scheduled to open in the Spring of 1883, but a ferocious storm on the night of 25 January 1883 resulted in severe damage to the glass roof. Following a rethink of the roof's design (and much embarrassment to the building's architects, who were promptly dismissed by the pier company), the decision was taken to replace the original glass roof with a sturdy lead one, more suited to the demands of a North Wales location in winter. Extensive rebuilding work was required, and the building did not open officially until September 1886. The pavilion was , with a width ranging from to . The canopy roof was . One end of the building housed the Egyptian Hall, which featured hieroglyphics on its wall decorations. Orchestra (1886‚Äì1936) Rivi√®re's Orchestra at the Llandudno pier pavilion was a great success and was quickly trebled in size to symphony proportions. It contributed to the development of that great British summer entertainment, the promenade concert. The young Henry Wood came to Llandudno to observe the then elderly Rivi√®re at work. Following Rivi√®re, the locally renowned Arthur Payne held the baton for many years until 1925 when he was followed in 1926 by Malcolm Sargent for two notable seasons then by others from season to season including, as a guest conductor on several occasions, Sir Adrian Boult. The pier pavilion orchestra continued its summer seasons until 1936 when it gave way to variety shows, a victim of changing entertainment tastes. A small orchestra survived, this was taken over in 1938 by John Morava who maintained the pier's orchestral tradition to the very end in 1974, when the orchestra (by then confined to the pierhead pavilion) was finally disbanded. Variety Entertainment (1936‚Äì1984) Thus, in 1936, the pavilion prepared to enter its second era - that of variety entertainment. This was to be the theatre's golden age, with the Pavilion firmly on the tour list of every major artist. Thousands of top acts appeared there over the years, including household names like George Formby, Ted Ray, Semprini, Petula Clark, Arthur Askey, Bryan Johnson, Bill Maynard (\\"Greengrass\\" in Heartbeat), Jimmy Edwards (Whacko!), Russ Conway, the Beverley Sisters, Cyril Fletcher and Cliff Richard. Special mention should be made of Welsh singer Ivor Emmanuel, who appeared regularly on Sunday night bills for many years. David Hughes also was a Sunday Night concert regular. During its long history, the theatre has regularly hosted political rallies and conferences, with the vast auditorium resounding to the voices of David Lloyd George, Stanley Baldwin, Ramsay MacDonald, Oswald Mosley, Neville Chamberlain, Clement Attlee, Harold Macmillan, Edward Heath and Winston Churchill. It is reputed that, during the Conservative Party's conference at the pavilion in 1948, a young lady decided to abandon her previous career plans and enter politics. Her name was Margaret Thatcher. In the decades following the war, the pavilion was as popular as ever with the thousands of holidaymakers returning to Llandudno year after year. It was not until the end of the 1960s that the popularity of the pavilion's variety shows began to flag - victims of the twin threats of television and cheap foreign holidays. A full programme of summer shows was carried on through the 1970s but the audiences were falling away steadily and the length of the summer season began to shorten. By now, the theatre was under the creative control of local impresario and comedian Alex Munro, who introduced new initiatives to bring back the audiences, including the pavilion's first pantomime in 1972, an event which was marred by the sad death of Munro's daughter Janet Munro, who died in tragic circumstances days before she was due to begin rehearsals for the show. Closure and subsequent uses (1984‚Äì1990) On 6 December 1983, the Llandudno Pier Company sold the pavilion for ¬£10,000 to Llandudno Pavilion Ltd, a sister company of Uttoxeter Investments Ltd, a leisure company that already operated the Llandudno Cabin Lift. Despite the high quality of the Summer shows, the audiences were still falling and in 1984, it was decided that the theatre would close at the end of the summer season. The final show at the pavilion was Startime Follies, a variety show featuring Tommy Trafford, Lynda Lee Lewis, Kay Carman and the Marie Ashton Dancers, with performances at 8pm nightly and a high season only matinee at 3pm daily. Ticket prices ranged from ¬£2 to ¬£2.60. The lack of audiences, increasing costs of maintaining the old building and new fire regulations had finally put paid to the pavilion's theatrical tradition‚Äî98 years after it had first opened. The pavilion's days as an entertainment venue were not entirely over, however. A few months before the theatre closed, a new attraction opened in the basement. The huge basement area (originally built as the country's largest indoor swimming pool back in 1886 but which closed shortly afterwards due to problems with water quality) had been home over the years to a small amusement arcade called Tusons and, later, a ghost train ride and vintage car 'round the world' ride. These were all cleared out to make way for the Llandudno Dungeon, a walk through horror waxworks exhibition, featuring scenes from the more gruesome aspects of human history, all built at a cost of over ¬£100,000. Scenes depicted included a full size replica of a Victorian London street, complete with Sweeney Todd's barber shop and opium den, the 1665 Great Plague of London, body snatchers at work and a full size model of a guillotine. This novel attraction proved successful for a few years but closed at the end of 1990, when the entire exhibition was sold and shipped to France. For the first time in over a hundred years, the entire pavilion stood empty and unused. Destruction and aftermath (1994‚Äìpresent) Lack of maintenance meant that the exterior of the building deteriorated rapidly but the interior remained in surprisingly good condition, with most of the original architectural and theatre features still in situ. January 1992 saw ownership of the building pass to the London-based Launchsign Ltd, which announced their intention to completely restore the building and introduce a Covent Garden-style indoor market to the former theatre area. Despite the grandiose plans, no effort was made to repair or even secure the theatre building, which became increasingly vandalised and a meeting place for local youths. The process of decay accelerated, until the almost inevitable arson attack in 1994 destroyed the main theatre building. The site has never been cleared properly and remains an eyesore until the present day. Attempts by Conwy County Council to redevelop the site have been constantly rebuffed by the current owner, a Worcester businessman called David Taylor. In 2011, the owner's agent and architects put forward plans for a modern, glass fronted, 110 bedroom hotel on the site. The design and scale of the proposed building was rejected by both local and national authorities but the owner has proved reluctant to submit a revised, more sympathetic design. The stalemate continued for several more years until a surprise announcement in April 2016 by local property developer, Alan Waldron, stated that he had secured the site and planned a new Pavilion building, incorporating underground car parking, commercial space and residential apartments.

Under the Ancien R√©gime Councillors of State were among the highest dignitaries of the French monarchy during the Ancien R√©gime. Being thirty in total, the Councillors of State included three clergymen, three from the old nobility (nobility \\"of the sword\\" or d'√©p√©e), and twenty-four from the noblesse de robe, or \\"administrative nobility\\". Ninety percent of the Councillors of State de robe were promoted from among the Masters of Requests, while the rest were chosen from among judges of the prerogative courts; often they had prior experience working as intendants. In 1789, their number was increased to 42: 25 full-time Councillors ordinary, 16 part-time consellors who functioned on a semester schedule, and the eldest of the Masters of Requests. Their title gave them great power, and in the administrative hierarchy they were considered directly below Princes of the royal family (\\"princes du sang\\"), cardinals, and Dukes or Peers (\\"Ducs et pairs\\"). The pay was minimal, i.e., 3,300 to 5,100 French pounds per year, depending on the duration of service, but could be augmented by an additional 4,000 pounds per year through pensions or by service on financial commissions. Councillors held commissions (i.e. not purchased and hereditary offices) appointed by the king by letters patent. The prestigious position conferred immediate nobility on the commission-holder, if not already a member of the nobility. Their official job description stated that they were to be \\"consulted by the King on any matter and on any occasion as the King saw fit\\". In practice, their role was a combination of the duties of present-day Councillors of State and justices of the French Supreme Court. Commissions were not limited by age, although the King generally appointed men of lawful age. Ren√©-Louis de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson became Councillor of State at the age of 24 and Marc-Pierre de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson at 22. Councillors often combined their function with other administrative positions such as ambassador, President of the High Court, and so forth All the Councillors of State sat on the King's Council of State (\\"Conseil priv√©\\", \\"Conseil des parties\\" or \\"Conseil d'√âtat\\"). As part of the judicial system and officially established in 1557, this was the largest of the King's Councils, composed of the Lord Chancellor, Dukes and Peers, the Ministers and Secretaries of State, the Controller-General, the 30 Councillors of State, the 80 Masters of Requests, and the Intendants of finance. The State councillors could also be called before other of the King's Councils on affairs under their charge. After the Revolution Councillors of State became high-level government officials serving in the Council of State. A Councillor of State is one of the six ranks of the Council's members, namely, Master, Senior Master, Master of Requests, Councillor of State, Department Head, and Vice-Chairman.

Susan Frederick-Gray, in June 2017. , he has served as the senior minister for the First Unitarian Church in Portland, Oregon. Career Between 1970 and 1980 Sinkford held management positions in marketing with Gillette, Avon Products, Johnson Products, and Revlon; he later founded his own business, Sinkford Restorations. Sinkford \\"turned to ministry\\" in 1993. In 2001 he became the seventh president of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations. In 2003, Sinkford said the \\"main goal of his presidency of the Unitarian Universalist Association was to reclaim a \\"vocabulary of reverence\\" within the association; he had been struck by the fact that the association's Purposes and Principles \\"contain not one piece of traditional religious language, not one word\\"; it includes generalizations about human dignity, justice and \\"the interdependent web of all existence,\\" but does not do much \\"to capture our individual searches for truth and meaning.\\" Sinkford has previously considered himself a \\"card-carrying atheist\\" who in 1997, after his comatose son had recovered, began to develop a \\"prayer life centered on thankfulness and gratefulness to God.\\" William F. Schulz who had served as UUA president from 1985 to 1993, supported Sinkford's efforts to use a \\"wide lexicon\\" of religious language, and had \\"long been critical of the position of some humanists that would sanctify secular language and lock us into a calcified rationalism.\\" Sinkford was succeeded in 2009 by the Rev. Peter Morales. Education Sinkford was born in San Francisco and attended Harvard University, where he was among those vocal in their opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War; upon commencement in 1968 he joined a group of students calling it \\"unjust and immoral\\" and pledging publicly not to serve in the armed forces, even if drafted. He graduated cum laude in 1968, then spent a year in Greece as a Michael Clark Rockefeller Fellow. In 1995, Sinkford received his M.Div. from Starr King School for the Ministry. In 2002, Tufts University awarded Sinkford the degree of Doctor of Humane Letters, Honoris Causa. References  External links  *The Reverend William G.

The aim is to solve Sudoku puzzles on one or more of the sides. The toy was created in 2006 by Jay Horowitz in Sebring, Ohio. Production A scrambled Sudokube puzzleThe Sudoku Cube was invented by veteran toy maker Jay Horowitz after he had the idea to combine Sudoku and a Rubik's Cube. Horowitz already owned molds to produce Rubik's Cubes and was able to use them to produce his new design. Mass production is completed in China by American Classic Toy Inc, a company belonging to Horowitz. The product is sold in the United States in retailers such as Barnes & Noble and FAO Schwarz. There are 12 types of Sudoku Cube, which differ in difficulty and are aimed at different age ranges. Description In a standard Rubik's Cube, the player must match up colours on each side of the cube. In the Sudoku Cube, the player must place the numbers one to nine on each side with no repetition. This is achieved by rotating the sides of the cube. Variations of the Sudoku Cube are the Sudokube and Roxdoku, as well as cubes with 4√ó4√ó4 squares instead of the normal 3√ó3√ó3. This cube is very difficult compared to other cubes because as well as requiring basic knowledge of a Rubik's cube, the player must also know basic sudoku concepts. Any wrong move could put the puzzle in jeopardy. Computer simulations 3-D programming languages such as VPython can be used to create simulations of a Sudoku Cube.Scalable Sudokube Simulation - YouTube Such simulations can offer features such as scaling the sudokube (to create 4√ó4√ó4 or 5√ó5√ó5 puzzles), saving, resetting, undoing, and the option to design one's own sudokube patterns.

Many of his buildings in Tallinn are now valued as great examples of 1930s architecture, for example, the prominent Scandic Hotel Palace on Freedom Square. His creation can be categorised as functionalism with some influence of Chicago school and traditional art.  Biography and career  Elmar Lohk attended school in Vladivostok and worked in Shanghai. He then studied architecture in Darmstadt University of Technology 1921-1925 and started to work in Tallinn in 1926. In 1930s, he designed several significant and visually impressive buildings in Tallinn: ‚ÄûEEKS-house‚Äú 10 Vabaduse square (1937), Palace hotel (1937), National Health Service Building in T√µnism√§e (1939), and the Kopli Community Centre (1937). The best example of this kind of representative architecture was the reviewing stand at the Kadriorg stadium (1937 with A. Komendant, an engineer who later became a constructor for L. Kahn). In addition to larger buildings E. Lohk designed a number of remarkable villas: 24 Kase str, Maasika str 4/6, Lahe str 6. Among his well-known buildings are the ‚ÄûKalev‚Äú club in Kaarli Avenue (1932), dwelling houses 12 Raua str and 14 Raua str and the chapel of P√ºhavaimu parish in the Rahum√§e cemetery (1932). Lohk won several prizes for architecture in international competitions: the Officer‚Äôs Casino in Kaunas, the Town Hall in Tallinn and the Tallinn Art Museum. In 1940, during the soviet occupation Lohk‚Äôs wife Ilse and his parents were deported to Siberia, he himself had to seek refuge abroad. In 1943, Lohk worked in Finland at A. Aalto‚Äôs bureau, in 1944 he moved to Sweden. In 1944, E. Lohk won the first prize in the competition for Sahlgrenska hospital project in G√∂teborg. He was involved in the project work of the hospital until its completion in 1959. Elmar Lohk died in 1963.

Neartown Association. Retrieved October 20, 2008. The theater has three projection screens; one large screen, downstairs, and two smaller screens, upstairs. History The River Oaks Theatre was built in 1939. It is an example of late-1930s Art Deco design. It was the last of the deluxe neighborhood movie theaters built by Interstate Theatre Corporation. The theater opened on November 28, 1939. Paul Scott had the lease to the theater. Its first film was Bachelor Mother. In February 1947 Interstate Theaters acquired the River Oaks Theatre.Welling, p. 128. In late 1975 the chain Trans- Continental took control from Interstate. The New Mexico chain Movie, Inc. took control of the River Oaks Theatre in 1977. The theater's focus changed from first-run films to alternative films such as re-released films, and classic, foreign, cult, and old films. Movie, Inc. later merged with Landmark Theatre Company.Welling, p. 129. Since 1976, the theater has been operated by Landmark Theatres and generally shows foreign language and independent films, as well as other \\"art-house\\" movies. The theater re-opened on March 26, 1977. On September 9, 1982, there was a screening of Salo at the theater; this was the third showing in a three-year period. Vice squad officers waited for the screening to conclude and arrested the manager in a raid. The authorities charged him with promoting obscene material but a jury acquitted the manager in an April 1983 trial.Welling, p. 130. During a January 1983 screening of Fire on the Water there was a dueling protest between Ku Klux Klan and anti- Klan groups. After the release of the 1985 film Hail Mary there were protests from church groups. The theater's focus went back to first run films by the mid-1980s due to an increase in video VHS releases and cable. In the mid-1980s the theater owners did a $400,000 renovation.Welling, p. 131. They removed a group of seats from the downstairs auditorium so a projector could be installed. The seating capacity was changed to 546 seats. The owners changed the balcony into two 125-seat each mini-theaters. The 1939-era carbon-arc projectors were replaced with platter-system projectors. The balcony screens received an ultrastereo sound system, while Dolby was used for the downstairs screens.Welling, p. 130-131. The theater owners installed a caf√© in the upstairs area and elevators. New paint in gray and blue was applied to the interior. On May 15, 1986, the renovated theater re-opened. October 5, 2012 the theatre showed its final movie on 35mm film, The Master, before being upgraded to 100% digital projection. In December 1996 premiere of the film The Evening Star was held here. The theater is a part of the River Oaks Shopping Center, located on the eastern edge of the prestigious River Oaks subdivision. The property and River Oaks Theatre have been well maintained. In 2018 Landmark was acquired by Cohen Media Group, changing the theater's ownership.

Theatre closing controversy According to several Houston- area preservation groups, in July 2006, Weingarten Realty Investors, the company that owns the shopping center announced to its tenants that the entire shopping center was going to be bulldozed and replaced with new buildings in 2008. The groups' statements lead to a fervor in the Houston area to preserve the theater and the surrounding shopping center. Several movements aimed at the theater have established websites and petitions. Many of the backers of the movement to save the theater include many wealthy residents of River Oaks. Many Houstonians have signed a petition to save the theater. On August 30, 2006, Carolyn Farb announced that she would make an effort to preserve the theatre. She stood in front of the theater with a group of supporters. All wore shirts reading \\"Save Our Shrines\\" in black.Welling, p. 132.

The film stars Lauren Velez, Jon Seda, Lisa Vidal, Griffin Dunne, Jesse Borrego and Rita Moreno, and was written and directed by Darnell Martin who, in her filmmaking debut, became the first African-American female filmmaker to take helm of a film produced by a major film studio. The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Lisette Linares (Lauren Velez) is a young mother of three children, married to Chino (Jon Seda), a bicycle messenger. Although he is always reliable as the breadwinner of the family, Chino is having an affair with neighbor Magdalena (Lisa Vidal). One summer evening, as a blackout sweeps the neighborhood, Chino gets arrested for looting. Faced now with the reality of keeping her family together while the main breadwinner is in jail, Lisette, with the encouragement of her transgender sister Alexis (Jesse Borrego), decides to give her dream of becoming a print model a chance. As she happens to be in the right place at the right time, Lisette lands a job as the personal assistant to a major record label producer (Griffin Dunne), who is trying to sign a major Latin music group (played by the real life group the Barrio Boyzz). Chino is then released from prison by Magdalena and her father, who reveals that she has a son named Richie, whom she claims was fathered by Chino. This causes Lisette to hit rock bottom and move in with Alexis. At her new job, while having sex with her boss, he answers a number of phone calls, which frustrates Lisette. The next day, Chino tries to go back to his job, but is fired due to his criminal record. Lisette then confronts Chino to prove that she had sex with another man to get even with him. While Chino is taking the kids out for ice cream, his extremely rebellious son, Li'l Chino, asks if he could buy ice cream, but Chino tells him that he needs to work in order to buy things. His son then shows him money so Chino allows him to buy the ice cream, but when his younger daughter notices that he is wearing new sneakers and pants, Chino realizes that his son has become a drug dealer. Chino furiously lashes out at his son, pushing him towards a mural with a picture of his uncle (Chino's brother) on it, who was a police officer killed by a drug dealer. He whips his son in front of the whole block while his son's friends laugh at him. Alexis notices the commotion and tries to stop him. Alexis then points out that his son is just a little boy and pulls him away, but Li'l Chino runs away. The kids are still laughing and continue to insult Lil' Chino as weak.

Her last name, Sordino, is an Italian word that can be translated as \\"deaf.\\" The character's ordeals were based on Anderson's own experiences; she was raped one summer prior to starting high school. Storyline Speak One summer, prior to starting her first day at Merry Weather High School, 14-year-old Melinda \\"Mel\\" Sordino goes to a house party with three other friends and is raped by a senior, Andy Evans. This abuse forces her into silence and drastically changes her life and social structure; in fact, for most of the novel, she refers to Andy only as IT. She finds solace in her art class and teacher, Mr. Freeman, where she has a year long assignment of drawing a tree which plays a major role in her life. Throughout the year she slowly creates a hidden room for herself in an old janitor's closet, which acts as her safe haven, and is the setting for the climactic ending of the novel. Throughout the year, several minor events led up to her coming forward about her rape. These events include her parents giving her art supplies showing that they care, her only companion and friend Heather leaving her and saying Melinda needs therapy, seeing things written about Andy on the bathroom wall and cutting school the next day. For the majority of the novel, she refuses to admit to herself that she was raped, a fact that makes it hard for Melinda to heal and continue with her life. Melinda attempts to confide in her ex-best friend Rachel, who is dating Andy and initially doesn't believe her. Rachel later realizes the truth after Andy groped her during a dance; she then avoids Andy for fear of getting raped by him. Andy angrily confronts her about talking to Rachel and attempts to rape her again, Melinda fights back and finally break her silence, which sets her free from her isolation and terror. They are found by the school's lacrosse team and, due to Rachel has been telling people around the school about Andy's actions and his past victims have begun to come forward after seeing Melinda's brief message on the girls' restroom, their altercation removes any doubt of his guilts. Therefore, Andy would face the consequences of his crimes against Melinda. Catalyst In Anderson's 2002 novel Catalyst, Melinda Sordino appears for a few pages, now in tenth grade at Merryweather High and having regained control over her life. When a fellow student, Kate Malone, has a mental breakdown, she counsels and helps her through the rough patch. It is stated that Andy Evans is found guilty but does not go to prison; instead, he is sentenced to probation and has to register as a sex offender, typically is under house arrest (an alternative to prison), must be electronically tagged by an ankle monitor when completing his penalty, having limited contacts to others except his caregivers (his parents and other immediate family members), and ordered to stay away from Melinda and her family at all times. Thus, his life becomes difficult owing to having a criminal history as a rapist, and his daily activities after high school such as attending school, work, probation appointments, counseling, or community servicing are restricted by the law and closely monitored by probation officers until he finishes his sentence. In the 10th anniversary edition of Speak, Anderson explained that she was seriously considering making a sequel, but could not think of a basic plot, citing that sequels are usually meant to build on a previous film's popularity, using Jaws: The Revenge as an example. Voice Melinda is the first person narrator of Speak. She is very observant and notices every small detail. Her abuse has made her cynical (such as thinking she is too old to celebrate Halloween despite her schoolmates dressing up, as well as no longer believing in Santa), though she is very secretive about it. The cliques and social groups (or \\"clans\\") at her school disgust her, a fact which she makes well known through her narration. At times her voice seems to be just a stream of consciousness, having little or no start nor end. The sentence structure is often short and choppy, representing how Melinda is feeling at the moment.  Appearance  Melinda's physical appearance is rarely described, except in the context of what clothing she is wearing and how her lips are chapped and scabbed over. It is also mentioned that she is a size ten while trying on jeans at the store her mother works at. It is also mentioned she has black eyebrows and \\"muddy\\" brown eyes. Her mother buys her clothing, which she dislikes, and her lips are always bloody and dry from the fact that she bites them when she sees Andy Evans, or when something bad happens to her. It is mentioned in \\"Winter Break\\" that she is not extremely pretty, which shows that Melinda is just an average looking girl. In the chapter \\"Hall of Mirrors\\", it is told that Melinda wears a size ten pants. It also mentions she has auburn hair in one of the chapters. In other media Kristen Stewart as Melinda Sordino.

Life and playing career Bradshaw was born in Liverpool, Merseyside and was signed for Liverpool from Northwich Victoria in October 1893 by manager John McKenna. Originally playing as a centre-forward, Bradshaw made his debut against Woolwich Arsenal, in a Football League Division Two game, scoring the last goal in a 5‚Äì0 victory. He went on to score seven in the remaining fourteen matches of the 1893‚Äì94 season, helping Liverpool to the Second Division title and promotion to the top tier of English football, after a Test Match victory over Newton Heath. During the following season Bradshaw was the only ever- present and scored seventeen times, in a Liverpool team that struggled and were eventually relegated back down to Division 2. Liverpool again topped the Second Division at the end of the 1895‚Äì96 season with Bradshaw scoring twelve goals from his new position on the left-wing, his versatility giving Liverpool an extra dimension to their attack. Bradshaw gained one England cap when he played against Ireland on 20 February 1897 and holds the distinction of being Liverpool's first ever player to achieve International recognition. Bradshaw left Liverpool in May 1898, returning briefly to Northwich Victoria before joining Tottenham Hotspur. His brief stay at Northumberland Road was marked with a little piece of history when his goal in an F A cup tie in 1899 helped Spurs become the first lower division club ever to come from behind to beat top flight opposition in the shape of Sunderland.Giant Killers 1899 Bradshaw then made the journey from North to east London that summer, joining Thames Ironworks, the team that would later become West Ham. He was immediately appointed as the club's captain. During a Southern League match on 7 October 1899, Bradshaw sustained an injury from a kick to the head in The Irons 1‚Äì0 win over Bedminster that would begin a series of events that would see the condition of his health deteriorate. He still managed to make a strong contribution, scoring a goal in The Irons biggest win of the season, 7‚Äì0 away to Dartford. Bradshaw played his last Southern League game ever, in a 0‚Äì0 home draw against New Brompton on 11 November. Only a week later, The Irons had to play New Brompton again, this time in the FA Cup, and a 0‚Äì0 draw, was followed by 2‚Äì0 replay win, setting up a next round tie against Thames Ironworks' arch- rivals Millwall. The clearly ailing Bradshaw was rested for the next two games, in preparation for the tie against Millwall, which was to follow 16 days later. In the game on 9 December, Bradshaw made his comeback, scoring the only goal in a 1‚Äì2 defeat. This would be his last game for the club, and indeed in football in general. Bradshaw finally succumbed to his lengthy illness on Christmas Day 1899. His cause of death was recorded as consumption. Bradshaw's death was remembered by Thames Ironworks player and future West Ham manager Syd King, in his brief history of the club: :\\"The record of 1899‚Äì1900, however, would not be complete without some reference to poor Tom Bradshaw, who came from Spurs with Joyce. How well I remember that match with Queens Park Rangers during the Christmas holidays, when Joyce brought over the sad message to the Memorial Grounds that our comrade had passed away. Poor Tom was one of the cleverest wing forwards I have ever known and he was immensely popular with everybody.\\" ‚Äì Syd King, 'Book of Football' (1906) Bradshaw's close friends Bill Joyce and Kenny McKay left for Portsmouth and Fulham respectively.

She told him that the most beautiful woman in the world was the daughter of the Flower Queen, who had been kidnapped by dragons. He could save her and marry her. To help, she gave him a bell: to ring it once would bring the King of the Eagles; twice, the King of the Foxes; and thrice, King of the Fishes. He told his father he meant to rescue the daughter and set out. After a year, he met a very old man, who did not know where the dragon was, but if he traveled a year, the prince might meet his father who might know. At the end, the father could not tell him, but directed him on to his father. That man told him that the dragon had just gone to sleep‚Äîit slept one year and woke the next‚Äîbut the princess was held by his mother in the next mountain, and the Mother Dragon held a ball every night, at which the daughter would be. He entered the Mother Dragon's service, saying that he had heard of her beauty and goodness. She was an ugly woman with three heads. She told him that he had to take her mare out to pasture for three days and always return with it. The first day, it vanished, and he rang the bell. The king of the eagles found the mare racing among the clouds and brought it back. He brought it back to the Mother Dragon, who, as a reward, gave him a cloak of copper and let him come to the ball, where he-dragons and she-dragons were dancing. He met the Flower Queen's daughter, who told him to ask for the mare's foal as reward. The second day, the mare vanished again, he rang the bell twice, and the king of foxes brought the mare back from the hill; the Mother Dragon gave him a silver cloak and let him go to the ball again. The third day, the mare vanished again, he rang the bell thrice, and the king of the fishes brought the mare back from the river. The Mother Dragon gave him a golden cloak, said she would make him her body servant, and when he asked for the foal, gave it; she was pleased with him because he had flattered her beauty. The Flower Queen's daughter told him they would meet in the meadow if he succeeded. The Mother Dragon let him go to the ball, but he went to the stables instead. At midnight, he and the Flower Queen's daughter fled on the foal. The dragons woke their brother, but they got to the Flower Queen, who protected them. The queen agreed to a wedding, as long as her daughter came and lived with her in the winter. The prince agreed, and despite it, was happy with his bride their entire lives. Commentary The conclusion is, obviously, a reversal of the Persephone myth: the daughter lives with her mother in the winter, and her husband during the growing seasons.

He was the father of Emmett Till, whose murder in August 1955 at the age of 14 galvanized the Civil Rights Movement. A soldier during World War II, Louis Till was executed by the U.S. Army in 1945 after being found guilty of murder and rape. The circumstances of his death were little known even to his family until they were revealed after the trial of his son's murderers ten years later, which affected subsequent discourse on the death of Emmett Till. Life Louis Till grew up an orphan in New Madrid, Missouri.Till-Mobley and Benson, pp. 14‚Äì15. As a young man he worked at the Argo Corn Company and was an amateur boxer. At the age of 17, Till began courting Mamie Carthan, a woman of the same age. Her parents disapproved, thinking the charismatic Till was \\"too sophisticated\\" for their daughter. At her mother's insistence Mamie broke off their courtship but the persistent Till won out, and they married on October 14, 1940. Both were 18 years old. Their only child, Emmett Louis Till, was born on July 25, 1941. Mamie left her husband soon after learning that he had been unfaithful. Louis, enraged, choked her to unconsciousness, to which she responded by throwing scalding water at him. Eventually Mamie obtained a restraining order against him. After he repeatedly violated this order, a judge forced Till to choose between enlistment in the Army and imprisonment. Choosing the former, he enlisted in 1943.Till-Mobley and Benson, pp. 14‚Äì17. Crime and death While serving in the Italian Campaign, Till was arrested by military police, who suspected him and another soldier, Fred A. McMurray, of the murder of an Italian woman and the rape of two others, in Civitavecchia. After a short investigation, he and McMurray were court- martialed, found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. The sentence was carried out at the United States Army Disciplinary Training Center north of Pisa on July 2, 1945.Houck and Grindy, pp. 134‚Äì135.Whitfield, p. 117. He had been imprisoned alongside American poet Ezra Pound, who had been imprisoned for collaborating with the Nazis and Italian Fascists; he is mentioned in lines 171‚Äì173 of Canto 74 of Pound's Pisan Cantos: :\\"Till was hung yesterday :for murder and rape with trimmings\\" Till was buried in Row 4, Grave 73 of Plot E in Oise-Aisne American Cemetery. Aftermath Confidential magazine headlines a story on Louis Till's execution in 1956 The circumstances of Till's death were not revealed to his family; Mamie Till was only told that her husband's death was due to \\"willful misconduct\\". Her attempts to learn more were comprehensively blocked by the United States Army bureaucracy. The full details of Louis Till's crimes and execution only emerged ten years later. On August 28, 1955, 14-year-old Emmett Till was murdered in Mississippi, after reportedly trying to flirt with Carolyn Bryant, a local white woman. (Years later, a historian claimed that Bryant disclosed to him that she had fabricated testimony that Till made verbal or physical advances towards her in the store. However, the family of Bryant has disputed this claim.) Her husband and brother-in-law abducted Till and beat him to death, then threw his body into the river. Both were arrested, charged with and tried for first-degree murder, but were acquitted by an all-white jury. After the trial gained international media attention, Mississippi senators James Eastland and John C. Stennis uncovered details about Louis Till's crimes and execution and released them to reporters. The Southern media immediately leapt upon the story: various editorials claimed that the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the \\"Yankee\\" media had covered up, or lied about, the record of Emmett Till's father.Houck and Grindy, p. 136. Many of these editorials specifically attacked a short piece that had appeared in Life magazine, which presented Louis Till as having died fighting for his country in France. This article was in fact the only published piece that ever lionized Pvt. Till; in response, Life quickly published a retraction. For white Southerners, however, the impression was left that the erroneous Life article was representative of the Northern media in general. Subsequently, other editorials went so far as to tar Emmett Till with his father's crimes. These essentially portrayed Emmett as a serial rapist after the fashion of his father, thereby justifying his murder.Houck and Grindy, p. 138. In October 1955, one month after Emmett Till's abductors and murderers had been acquitted of the murder, the fate ten years earlier of Louis Till was made public for all to know (even though his military record had been confidential). The effect was to smear the reputation of young dead Emmett by associating him with the crimes for which his father had been executed. In November 1955, one month later, a grand jury declined to indict the two abductors for kidnapping Till, despite the testimony given that they had in fact admitted kidnapping him. In 2016, 71 years after the execution of Louis Till and 61 years after the murder of his son Emmett, author John Edgar Wideman explored the circumstances leading up to and including the military conviction of Louis Till. In the book, Writing to Save a Life ‚Äì The Louis Till File, Wideman examined the trial record from the US military United States v. Louis Till (CMZ288642). Upon his request it had been sent to him by the United States Court of Criminal Appeals, Arlington, Virginia. This trial record was more than 200 pages long. In his review of the trial record, Wideman concluded that there may indeed be questions to be raised of conclusions reached about Louis Till's criminal conduct, drawn in and from the transcript. In 2016 Wideman stated that he could not \\"rescue Louis Till from prison and the hangman\\".

Services of Supply became one of the three autonomous components of the Army of the United States on 9 March 1942. It was renamed the Army Service Forces on 12 March 1943, as it was felt that the term \\"supply\\" did not accurately describe its broad range of activities. From the day of inception (and even before) in 1942 through the end of WWII, the SOS/ASF was commanded by Lieutenant General (later General) Brehon B. Somervell. Most theaters of war had their own logistical organization, usually also named the Services of Supply. The European Theater, and its SOS was subdivided into the ETO and the MTO (Mediterranean Theater of Operations) for the Operation Torch invasion of North Africa, then Sicily, then Italy, though the MTO was largely supplied by the SOS out of Great Britain. The SOS-ETO became TSF/ET (Theater Service Forces‚ÄîEuropean Theater) on D-Day, 6 June 1944, the term SOS was abolished, and its activities on the continent were referred to as COM-Z, or Communications Zone. Southwest Pacific Area United States Army Services of Supply, Southwest Pacific Area (USASOS SWPA) in the South West Pacific Area were a direct outgrowth of the U.S. Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA), formed from command elements arriving in Australia with the Pensacola Convoy. They were commanded by Brigadier General Richard J. Marshall, and later Brigadier General J. L. Frink from September 1943. They were abolished in April 1945, and absorbed into Army Forces, Western Pacific (AFWESPAC). European Theater The Services of Supply, European Theater of Operations (ETO), was established in England on 24 May 1942 under the command of Major General John C. H. Lee. Almost two years of build up followed, supporting the North African Campaign and eventually the Invasion of Normandy. The command was redesignated COMZ (Communications Zone) after the 6 June 1944 invasion. Within COMZ was ADSEC (the Advance Section, Communications Zone) and FECOMZ (Forward Echelon, Communications Zone). This command was divided in the fall of 1942 to include service and supply functions in the North African Theater of Operations to support the Operation Torch invasion of North Africa, and the subsequent invasions of Sicily, Italy, and southern France.

It aims to engage drug-misusing offenders involved in the Criminal Justice system in formal addiction treatment and other support, thereby reducing drug-related harm and reducing offending behaviour. Introduced in 2003, it formed a part of both of New Labour's '10 year' drug strategies. In their 2010 Drug Strategy, the Conservative / Liberal Democrat coalition state their continued intention to support DIP.http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/alcohol-drugs/drugs/drug- strategy/drug-strategy-2010?view=Binary Overview The Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) is the UK's main Criminal Justice initiative aimed at engaging substance misusing offenders in drug treatment. It does this through a variety of methods, some coercive, such as the Tough Choices programme, and some relying on voluntary engagement. Class A drug-misusing offenders are identified on their journey through the CJS and steered towards treatment and wraparound support. Key points of intervention include following a positive drugs test in police custody, and following release from prison. DIP's key partners include police, the probation service, prisons, courts and other criminal justice agencies, as well as the National Treatment Agency and the Department of Health. It is hard to discern the precise cost of DIP. Whilst DIP Key Messages (of February 2009) identified that 'over ¬£600 million has been invested in DIP,', DIP's Operational Handbook (also 2009) put the figure at 'over ¬£900m'. Some evidence has been taken to suggest that DIP has been effective in achieving its aims, though a serious shortfall in methodologically rigorous evaluations makes such claims problematic. Nonetheless, in his foreword to the 2008 Drug Strategy the Home Secretary claimed that DIP coercion and case management have 'contributed to a fall in recorded acquisitive crime of around 20 per cent'. A short while later, DIP Key Messages made rather grander claims: 'since 2003, acquisitive crime (which is strongly associated with class A substance misuse) has fallen by 32 per cent in England and Wales. Tough Choices In December 2005, aspects of the Drugs Act 2005 were piloted at various DIPs around the country. Under the heading \\"Tough Choices\\", this included a \\"Test on Arrest\\" procedure, a \\"Required Assessment and Follow Up Assessment\\" process and an extension of the \\"Restrictions on Bail\\" scheme, which was legislated for under Section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Since April 2006, Tough Choices has been phased in across England and Wales. Test on Arrest Under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984(PACE), it had been possible for police to drug test Detained Prisoners since 1984. The Drugs Act 2005 introduced, at selected \\"intensive DIP area\\" police stations, a mandatory drug test for every individual who had been arrested for a specified list of \\"trigger offences.\\" Trigger offences were first set out in the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000, and constitute a list of offences known have a clear link to substance misuse (such as Theft). Arrestees may also be tested for 'non- trigger' offences (including, for example, those related to prostitution) with the authority of a police inspector. Individuals who refused to take this test, a \\"non-intimate saliva sample\\", could face up to three months in custody and a ¬£2,500 fine. Individuals who tested positive were then compelled to undergo a two-part \\"Required Assessment\\" with a drug worker from their local DIP. Required Assessment Individuals who test positive under the \\"Test on Arrest\\" scheme are required to see a drug worker for a single appointment. Although the Drugs Act 2005 had introduced a contingency for a \\"Follow-up Required Assessment\\" process, this measure was not implemented until March 2007. Individuals who fail to attend either of these appointments could face up to three months in prison or a ¬£2,500 fine. Restrictions on Bail Restrictions on Bail had been introduced under the Criminal Justice Act 2003. This piece of legislation amended the Bail Act 1976 by reversing the presumption of bail to anyone who had tested positive to a class A drug, unless they agreed to undergo assessment and treatment with their local DIP for the duration of their court bail. This effectively obliged courts to implement a bail condition compelling such persons to attend their local DIP. The stated aim of this was to \\"prevent offending on bail\\". Failure to abide by this condition could result in the denial of further court bail. Restrictions on Bail was initially piloted in a number of areas but now operates across England and Wales Non-Intensive DIPs All \\"Drug and Alcohol Action Team\\" (DAAT) areas in the UK had created a DIP prior to the introduction of Tough Choices. Some of these DIPs, where drug-related crime was perceived to be lower, were labelled \\"Non-Intensive\\". Non-Intensive areas were different in one way - local police stations could not legally drug test. However, a Required Assessment and a Restrictions on Bail condition could still be given to people from these areas. Prolific and Other Priority Offenders Scheme and DIP In 2004, the Prolific and Other Priority Offenders (PPO) Scheme was set up. A crime reduction initiative, it aims to identify a hard-core of individuals considered responsible for large amounts of crime, and manage them through either rehabilitation or conviction. There are currently 10,000 offenders in the UK who are involved in the PPO scheme, a significant proportion of whom have drug dependency issues. The Home Office encourages DIPs and PPO schemes to work closely together in such cases to ensure effective case management of offenders. Controversy Release, a UK charity which advises professionals and the public on criminal justice and drugs matters, strongly opposed the Test-on-Arrest and Required Assessment measures brought in by the Drugs Act 2005. They stated that mandatory drug testing was possibly in contravention with Article 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998, and that the possibility of false positives could lead to mandatory assessments for non-drug using Detained Prisoners. They also queried the Required Assessment process, calling into question the ethics and efficacy of coerced addiction treatment, and highlighting the possible re-direction of resources away from the voluntary treatment sector.

Life Bernhard was born on 1 April 1851 at Meiningen in what was then the German Confederation, as the eldest son of Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen and his first wife Princess Charlotte of Prussia. He had one full sister, Princess Marie Elisabeth, and several half- brothers by his father's second marriage. From 1860 Bernhard was schooled by a Prof. Rossmann before he went to study at Heidelberg University in 1869. For the war against France he interrupted his studies and served as Ordonnanz- Offizier. After the war ended he resumed his studies at Leipzig. From 1873 he again served in the military and rose into the highest echelons: By 1905 he was Generaloberst and Generalinspekteur der 2. Armeeinspektion (Mitteldeutschland). In 1909, he became Generalfeldmarschall and in 1912 left military service with that rank. Bernhard of Saxe-Meiningen with Charlotte of Prussia around the time of their engagement, 1876 He married in Berlin on 18 February 1878 Princess Charlotte of Prussia, his second cousin, daughter of Frederick III, German Emperor and granddaughter of the Queen Victoria. They had one daughter: Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen (b. Potsdam, 12 May 1879 - d. Schlo√ü Neuhoff, 26 August 1945), married on 24 September 1898 to Heinrich XXX of Reuss-K√∂stritz. Reign Bernhard assumed the Duchy of Saxe- Meiningen after the death of his father in 1914. With the start of World War I Bernhard hoped to be assigned command over an army but was disappointed. In reaction he also withdrew from his role in the Duchy's government. After Germany lost the war, the German revolution forced Bernhard to abdicate as duke on 10 November 1918. Like all the German princes he lost his title and state. He spent the rest of his life in his former country as a private citizen. Bernhard died on 16 January 1928 in Meiningen. He is buried next to his wife in the park at Altenstein. Interests Despite his military career he also took a great interest in the arts. He was active as a composer, poet and translator. He was known in particular as an expert on Modern Greek and was renowned for translating German literature into Greek. For his historical studies, for which he repeatedly travelled to Greece and Asia Minor (today Turkey), the University of Breslau awarded him an honorable doctorate.

It is a community in Caerphilly County Borough.  History & amenities  Centre section of the Maesycwmmer Viaduct. Maesycwmmer is still overshadowed by the vast Maesycwmmer Viaduct,Maesycwmmer Viaduct at geograph.org.uk which dates from 1853 and which carried the Taff Vale Extension of the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway over the Rhymney valley. In 2000 the viaduct was re-opened for public pedestrian access. Today the village features the \\"Wheel o Drams\\" (locally known as \\"The Stargate\\") sculpture by Andy Hazell, an unusual piece of modern art formed from a circle of coalmining dram trucks to commemorate the industrial heritage of this locality within the history of the South Wales Valleys. The village shared three railway stations with neighbouring Hengoed over the years (see Hengoed railway station). There are two pubs in Maesycwmmer: The Maesycwmmer Inn and The Angel (a third, The Butchers Arms, became an Indian restaurant called The Spice Tree). Maesycwmmer was a creation of the Industrial Revolution in the South Wales Coalfield. The houses built along the main road were purpose built for the workers that built the Maesycwmmer to Hengoed Viaduct. There is also a disused quarry in a field behind the houses of St Annes Gardens. Maesycwmmer has both a junior and a senior football team. The senior team, Maesycwmmer FC, was founded in 2010 and plays in the North Gwent Football League. Matches are played at The Bryn, just outside Maesycwmmer. The Angel pub, which the team used for its post match entertainment, is the main club sponsor.

Area code 703 was created as one of the original 86 North American area codes in October 1947, and originally served the entire Commonwealth of Virginia. Area code 571 was created on March 1, 2000 to form an overlay plan with 703. History On June 24, 1973, area code 703 underwent its first split, when the eastern portion of the state became area code 804. Permissive dialing of 703 continued across the Commonwealth until January 1, 1974. 703 was restricted to the northern and western regions of Virginia‚Äîfrom Arlington in the north to the Tennessee and Kentucky border‚Äîwhile everything from Danville eastward was reassigned to 804. Normal practice calls for the largest city in the original numbering plan area to retain the old area code during a split. However, C&P; Telephone wanted to spare the large number of federal agencies in Northern Virginia the expense and burden of having to change their numbers. A similar decision was made almost two decades later when Maryland's area code 301 was split; Baltimore and points east were assigned to area code 410 in order to allow federal agencies on the Maryland side of the metro to keep their current numbers. From 1947 to 1990, it was possible for telephone users in the northern Virginia portion of 703 to dial any number in the Washington metropolitan area with only seven digits. While the Washington metro area is split between three area codes‚ÄìMaryland's 301, the District's 202, and 703‚Äìit was a single local calling area. Every number in the Maryland and Virginia portions of the metro area was protected from assignment in the District's 202, essentially making 202 an overlay for the entire metro. One consequence of this was that no central office prefix could be duplicated anywhere in the Washington metro area. For instance, if a 1-202-574 number was in use in the District or a 1-301-574 was in use on the Maryland side of the metro, the corresponding 1-703-574 number could only be used in areas considered a safe distance from the Washington metro area, such as Roanoke and the Tri-Cities. By the end of the 1980s, the D. C. area was running out of numbers, so the partial overlay of 202 was ended in 1990. However, it soon became apparent that breaking seven-digit dialing in the Washington area would not free up enough numbers to keep up with demand on either side of the Potomac River. With this in mind, on June 19, 1995, most of the western portion of the old 703 area code was split off into the new area code 540, and 703 was restricted to northern Virginia. The same issue had forced the split of area code 410 from 301 four years earlier. The 1995 split was intended to be a long-term solution. However, within four years, 703 was close to exhaustion due to the proliferation of cell phones, fax machines, and pagers, as well as northern Virginia's explosive growth. To solve this problem, area code 571 was introduced on March 1, 2000, as an overlay to 703. Area code 571 serves most new telephone numbers; while it is primarily associated with mobile telephone lines, it is also used for new landline numbers, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office upon moving to Alexandria; the Transportation Security Administration, which was created in 2001 and has its headquarters in Arlington; and the Fairfax County Public Schools, which moved its headquarters to the Falls Church area in 2006. Local service providers Although former competitors Bell Atlantic (a former Baby Bell) and GTE had assigned geographical monopolies varying by region in Virginia, they merged in the late 1990s to form Verizon, now the dominant local telephone service provider throughout Virginia, including both of these area codes. Over 85% of all telephone numbers in both of these area codes are served by Verizon, a regulated monopoly. However, mobile telephone service is provided with numbers assigned these area codes by various operators such as AT&T; and T-Mobile, in addition to Verizon Wireless. Competition in the local telephone service market within these area codes has been joined by cable television operators such as Cox Communications, Comcast, and Verizon Fios, which provide local telephone service running over their own broadband fiber optic telecommunication networks (which also provide cable television and high-speed internet services). Dialing requirements Because of the overlay of 703 and 571, 10-digit dialing is mandatory even for local calls; cellphone callers do the same on all direct-dialled calls. Long-distance calls are dialed as eleven digits, using the prefix 1, but for landline-based phones only.NANP Administration System: Area Code 703 Service areas Area code 703 and the overlay area code 571 serve the following cities and towns in Virginia: Alexandria, Annandale, Ashburn, Burke, Centreville, Chantilly, Dale City, Fairfax, Falls Church, Franconia, Great Falls, Groveton, Herndon, Lake Ridge, Leesburg, Lorton, Manassas, Manassas Park, McLean, Mount Vernon, North Springfield, Oakton, Occoquan, Reston, South Riding, Springfield, Sterling, Vienna, West Springfield, and Woodbridge, plus all or part of these counties: Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince William and Stafford.

Along most of the lake are numerous summer homes, cottages, and permanent residences. The Yankee Springs Recreation Area is based on northeastern portions of the lake. Gun Lake is the location of a State Park with a boat launch, two beaches, a campground, and picnic areas. Features Gun lake is shaped like a butterfly; it has two halves that are somewhat symmetrical and shaped like the wings of a butterfly. In the southeast quarter is an island known as \\"Party Island\\" to those that do not own it. The owner has then such filed a complaint and the island is no longer open to the public. Hence the name \\"Party Island\\" was retired early summer of 2010. On the weekends many boats gather there because of the shallow, sandy rim around the island. Its official name is Orangeville Island. Other than Robbin's Bay, popular fishing spots include Pickerel Cove, on the southern shore, on the left \\"wing\\" of the lake, Bairds Cove, and the many channels that protrude off the \\"butterfly\\" part of the lake. It is a popular tourist destination in the summer. The shops and businesses sprinkled along the shores and inland enjoy that time of year. In the winter, many activities play a part in the lives of people that live there, such and Winterfest, where events such as a polar bear dip take place, and ice fishing in also a common sight in the cold months. Fishery In the lake there are populations of Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Longnose Gar, Muskie, Northern Pike, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Spotted Gar, Walleye, and Yellow Perch. Freshwater Crustaceans, known as Crayfish, also have some residency in the lake, and can be found in many of the shallows in the summertime as their young grow. The lake is most famous for its large Walleye population, although according to the last Michigan DNR report in 1991, they only make up about 8.6 percent of the lake's fish. Bullheads are the most prosperous species in the lake, although many of the other species exists peacefully despite their lower percentage of existence. Neighboring lakes A number of other lakes are closely connected to Gun Lake. An inlet leads to nearby Payne Lake, and also to Fish rearing ponds. The lake's outlet is into the Gun River, which connects by the Kalamazoo River to Lake Michigan. The largest nearby lake is Long Lake. In recent years, a small culvert was erected under the road separating Gun and Long Lakes in the Northeast corner of Gun Lake. It leads under the road, and is an easy gateway to get to Long Lake.

She served as a commissioned ship for five years and one month. The ship was laid down as Mormacgull under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 30) on 12 January 1939 at Chester, Pennsylvania, by the Sun Shipbuilding & Drydock Co., Hull 179; launched on 28 August 1939; sponsored by Miss Barbara Ann Moore; delivered 13 October 1939 to owner/operator Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc.; purchased by the Navy on 31 May 1941; renamed Alcyone and designated AK-24 on 3 June 1941; converted for naval service by the Boston Navy Yard; and placed in commission on 15 June 1941, Comdr. Daniel M. McGurl in command. Service history 1941 The cargo ship then reported for duty to Commander, Train, Atlantic Fleet. Following shakedown training, she departed New York City on 4 September and shaped a course for Iceland. The vessel arrived at Reykjav√≠k on the 16th and began disembarking passengers and discharging cargo. Upon the completion of this task, she left Icelandic waters on 5 October, sailed southwest-ward across the Atlantic, and arrived at Charleston, South Carolina, on the 13th. After one month of voyage repairs, the ship moved, via Norfolk, Virginia, to New York City to take on cargo and sailed on 28 November for the Caribbean. Among her ports of call during the cruise were Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; Jamaica; San Juan and Vieques, Puerto Rico; St. Thomas, Virgin Islands; Antigua; and Trinidad before she arrived back at New York on 27 December. 1942 During the first three months of 1942, Alcyone made two more voyages from New York and Norfolk to various points in the Caribbean. Among her assignments during these trips was the evacuation of civilians from Antigua to the United States. On one occasion, her convoy was attacked by German submarines. Although three consorts fell victim to torpedo attacks, Alcyone completed her trip unscathed and arrived back at Charleston on 12 April where she underwent availability. Alcyone was assigned to the Naval Transportation Service on 1 June and set sail from Norfolk on the 10th in a convoy bound for New Zealand with troops and equipment of the 1st Marine Division which would land on Guadalcanal early in August. She transited the Panama Canal on 18 June, joined the Pacific Fleet, and reached Wellington on H July. After discharging her cargo, the ship moved to Auckland, New Zealand, to take on material for transportation to advanced bases in the Pacific. Alcyone sailed independently from Auckland on 31 July and proceeded to Noum√©a, New Caledonia, and Espiritu Santo to distribute her cargo. Following these stops, she arrived at Sydney, Australia, on the 28th and underwent voyage repairs. On 8 September, the vessel left Australia; shaped a course for the West Coast of the United States; and reached San Francisco, California, on 29 September. She then entered the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, for conversion to an attack cargo ship. During the yard work, three 30-ton booms, a boat repair shop, and additional berthing space were added. Alcyone was redesignated AKA-7 on 26 November and was reassigned to Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet. The conversion work was completed early in November, and Alcyone departed San Francisco on the 6th. She was then involved in amphibious exercises and shakedown training off San Diego, California. The ship left California on 21 December and headed for the East Coast of the United States. 1943 USS Alcyone (AKA-7) Alcyone retransited the Panama Canal on 2 March, arrived at the Charleston Navy Yard on the 9th, and underwent repairs for a month before sailing to Norfolk in mid-April. Soon after reaching Norfolk, Alcyone began a period of training exercises in the Chesapeake Bay which lasted until early June. She sailed with Task Force 65 on the 8th for the Mediterranean. Her convoy repulsed several enemy attacks en route before arriving safely at Oran, Algeria, on 22 June. She took part in amphibious landing exercises and loaded her cargo holds in preparation for the upcoming assault on Sicily. Alcyone got underway on 5 July; arrived off Scoglitti, Sicily, five days later; and began discharging her cargo despite rough seas and frequent enemy air harassment. She landed her equipment and troops with the loss of only a few small boats, left the area on the 13th, and arrived back at Oran on 16 July. From there, the vessel moved on to Norfolk, where she arrived on 3 August. After a brief period in port, the attack cargo ship proceeded once again to the Pacific. She transited the Panama Canal on the last day of August and stopped at San Francisco before continuing on to Hawaii. Alcyone touched at Pearl Harbor on 30 September and participated in training exercises off Maui during October. She got underway on 10 November with Task Group (TG) 52.11 to participate in the invasion of Makin Island, Gilbert Islands. On the 20th, the vessel reached the transport area off that island and began unloading her cargo. Members of her crew also assisted other vessels in discharging their passengers and supplies. Despite heavy enemy resistance, Alcyone successfully completed her operations and left the area on the 24th. After a brief layover at Pearl Harbor, Alcyone continued on to San Diego, where she arrived on 19 December. She remained there through the Christmas holidays. 1944 Alcyone sailed for Hawaii on 13 January 1944. Upon reaching Pearl Harbor, the ship made final preparations for the assault on Kwajalein. She sortied from Oahu on 22 January and reached the transport area off Kwajalein on the 31st. Alcyone unloaded her cargo and assisted in the landing of troops from other ships as well. Enemy shore fire and dangerous coral reefs somewhat delayed her operations, and Alcyone remained in the area until mid-February. The cargo ship made a port call at Pearl Harbor before continuing on to the California coast. She reached San Pedro on 26 February and proceeded to a shipyard at Terminal Island for overhaul. A series of amphibious landing exercises followed the completion of the yard work, and Alcyone left the West Coast on 18 April, bound for Hawaii. She reached Pearl Harbor and joined forces preparing to attack Guam in the Marianas. The cargo ship anchored off that island on 22 July and commenced unloading operations. Upon completing this assignment, she got underway to return to Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 10 August and, shortly thereafter, entered drydock for minor repairs. The ship got underway again on 15 September and sailed to Manus, Admiralty Islands. After approximately a month of preparations and training, she sailed on 14 October as a member of TG 79.2, which was scheduled to begin the liberation of the Philippine Islands. The attacking force reached waters off the beaches of Leyte on the 20th and began the landing operations that same day. Alcyone discharged her cargo while undergoing enemy air attack and mortar fire from shore batteries. She completed her unloading operations on the 22d and proceeded to Hollandia, New Guinea, to reprovision. On 14 November, the ship sailed for Leyte to resupply the beachhead which had been established there. After unloading her cargo at Leyte, she retired to the Admiralties and reached Manus on the 24th. From that island, she moved to Cape Gloucester, New Britain, to take on units of the 40th Infantry Division. The ship carried these troops back to Manus, where she joined TG 79.4. On 16 December the group sailed to Huon Gulf, New Guinea, for a series of amphibious landing exercises. Upon their completion, the ships returned to Manus for final loadout prior to the invasion of Luzon, the largest island of the Philippines. 1945 On the last day of 1944, Alcyone sortied with TG 79.4, for the assault on the Lingayen beaches which began on 9 January 1945. The task of unloading her cargo was made more difficult by rough seas, Japanese suicide boat attacks, and enemy air raids. Alcyone remained in the area for five days before she finished emptying her holds. On the 13th, she set a course for Leyte where she replenished her stores before returning to Luzon on the 29th with a small attacking force for a landing at Zambales. The assault was unopposed, and operations were completed on 31 January. Alcyone left Philippine waters on 11 February, bound for the United States. She made port calls at Manus and at Pearl Harbor before reaching San Francisco on 12 March. The ship then entered the Moore Dry Dock Company, Oakland, California, for overhaul. During this yard period, her kingposts were replaced by quadruped masts, her troop berths were removed, and temporary cargo storage cages were installed. Upon completion of the yard work on 2 June, the ship was assigned to Service Forces, Pacific Fleet. On the 8th, Alcyone was routed to Seattle, Washington, for loading. She departed Seattle on 21 June and shaped a course for Ulithi. After pausing there briefly on 9 July, she got underway to rendezvous with logistic support ships provisioning the warships of the Fast Carrier Task Force in waters off the Japanese home islands. Alcyone completed unloading at sea on 2 August and set sail for Guam to replenish. While the ship was in the Marianas, Japan capitulated. Alcyone rejoined the logistics group on 23 August; and, three days later, she and her consorts entered Tokyo Bay. After unloading, Alcyone left Japan and returned to Guam to take on more cargo and supplies. She arrived back in Tokyo Bay on 1 October and began replenishing ships of the occupation forces. 1946 Alcyone remained in Japanese waters through early March 1946. She shuttled supplies and equipment among the ports of Yokosuka, Ominato, Aomori, Otaru, Wakayama, Sasebo, and Kure. The ship departed Yokosuka on 11 March and headed back to the United States. She arrived at San Francisco on 29 March and began a period of upkeep. On 15 May, the vessel proceeded to San Diego where she remained for two weeks. Alcyone continued sailing southward and transited the Panama Canal on 9 June. Five days later, she made port at Norfolk, Virginia. Preparations to deactivate the ship soon began. Alcyone was decommissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia, on 23 July 1946 and was transferred to the War Shipping Administration on 24 July 1946 for disposal. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 15 August 1946. The ship was sold to the Johnson Line on 17 March 1947, and refitted for service as the merchant vessel Star Alcyone, and later scrapped in 1969.http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/navalships/auxcargoships.htm Alcyone earned eight battle stars for her World War II service.

He served as a U.S. Representative from the state's 3rd Congressional District from 1861 to 1867. Early life Baxter was born in Brownington, Vermont, the son of William and Lydia (Ashley) Baxter. After attending local schools, he graduated from Norwich Military Academy in 1824, and entered the University of Vermont in Burlington. He left UVM in 1826 after his father's death, and was responsible for administering his father's estate. (In 1852, UVM conferred on Baxter the honorary degree of master of arts.) He moved to Derby Line, Vermont in 1828 where he engaged in agricultural and mercantile pursuits, which took him down the Connecticut River valley and into Canada. He was one of the original incorporators of the Connecticut and Passumpsic Rivers Railroad, which was planned to run almost the entire length of the state on the eastern border. Politics He became interested in politics early in his career. Baxter served as Assistant Judge of Orleans County from 1846 to 1847. He was the only Whig delegate from New England who supported Zachary Taylor for president in 1848. He also strongly supported Winfield Scott in his unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 1852. He became a Republican when the party was founded, and was a presidential elector for John Fremont in 1856. In 1860, after many years of urging, he finally ran for Congress, was successful and eventually served three terms, from March 4, 1861 to March 3, 1867, in the 37th, 38th, and 39th Congresses. During the 38th Congress, he chaired the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of the Navy. He also served on the Agriculture and Elections Committees. Civil War Baxter's time in Congress coincided with the four years of the American Civil War, and he was such a proponent of Vermont soldiers he earned the nickname, 'the soldier's friend.' One Vermonter's letters document instances where Mrs. Baxter, and other wives and daughters of Vermont's Congressional contingent, were strong supporters of the efforts of the Christian Commission. Baxter also frequently visited the regiments in the area immediately surrounding Washington, D.C., watching out for a son who had joined the 11th Vermont Infantry, and sponsoring others in their efforts to get promoted. During the bloody Battle of the Wilderness in May 1864, Baxter and his wife spent so much time in the hospitals in and around Fredericksburg, Virginia, tending to wounded soldiers, that they themselves suffered from exhaustion and eventually had to leave to recuperate. Post Civil War He remained in Washington, D.C. after completing his last term. Baxter suffered from asthma, and he died of pneumonia after a few days' illness. His was buried in the village cemetery in Strafford, Vermont.Biographical Directory of the United States Congress Baxter General Hospital, the Civil War soldier's hospital in Burlington, was named for Baxter, as was Portus Baxter Park in Derby Line.Holland Historical Society, Holland and Its Neighbors, 2004, page 97 Family His wife, Ellen Jannette Harris (1811‚Äì1882), daughter of Judge Jedediah Hyde Harris of Strafford, whom he married on June 19, 1832, survived him by fourteen years. They had eight children, four of whom lived to adulthood. The most notable was Jedediah Hyde Baxter, who served as Surgeon General of the United States Army. Judge Harris was the business partner of Senator Justin Smith Morrill. Baxter and Morrill became close friends as a result of the connection to Harris, with Morrill referring to Baxter as \\"one of nature's noblemen\\" and Baxter consciously patterning his business and political career on Morrill's.William Belmont Parker, The Life and Public Services of Justin Smith Morrill, 1924, page 52 References Further reading * \\"Baxter, Portus (1806-1868),\\" Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, 1774 - Present, sited August 13, 2006, * Crockett, Walter Hill.

The 2nd Parachute Brigade was the second parachute infantry brigade to be formed by the British Army in 1942; it was initially part of the 1st Airborne Division but in 1943, after the invasion of Italy, became an independent formation. As an independent brigade it was variously assigned at different times, and served under the command of the 2nd New Zealand Division, the 8th Indian Infantry Division, and the 1st Airborne Task Force. Before the end of the Second World War in Europe the brigade saw active service in Italy, the South of France and Greece. At the end of the European war the brigade returned to the United Kingdom and was intended to join the 44th Indian Airborne Division in the Far East, for service against the Japanese Empire, but the war ended before they sailed. Instead the brigade was assigned to the 6th Airborne Division, which had been named the Imperial Strategic Reserve, and sent to serve in the Mandate of Palestine. Defence cuts in the British armed forces after the war forced a reduction in the number of parachute brigades. By 1948 the 2nd Parachute Brigade was the last surviving parachute formation dating from the Second World War, all other parachute divisions and brigades having been disbanded. The last three battalions of the Regular Army comprised in the brigade returned to the United Kingdom; later in the same year the unit was posted to the British Army of the Rhine and re- designated as the 16th Independent Parachute Brigade Group. Background Impressed by the success of German airborne operations during the Battle of France in May 1940, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops.Otway, p. 21 On 22 June 1940 No. 2 Commando was turned over to parachute duties and on 21 November re-designated the 11th Special Air Service Battalion, with a parachute and glider wing and was later redesignated the 1st Parachute Battalion.Shortt and McBride, p. 4Moreman, p. 91 It was these men who took part in the first British airborne operation, Operation Colossus, on 10 February 1941.Guard, p. 218 The success of the raid prompted the War Office to expand the existing airborne force, setting up the Airborne Forces Depot and Battle School in Derbyshire in April 1942 and creating the Parachute Regiment, as well as converting several line infantry battalions into airborne battalions in August 1942.Harclerode, p. 218 The result was the formation of the 1st Airborne Division with the 1st Parachute and the 1st Airlanding Brigades under command, together with supporting units. Its commander, Major-General Frederick Arthur Montague \\"Boy\\" Browning, expressed his opinion that the fledgling force must not be sacrificed in \\"penny packets\\" and urged the formation of a third brigade.Ferguson, pp. 7‚Äì8 Permission was granted to form another parachute brigade in July 1942, numbered the 2nd Parachute Brigade, and Brigadier Ernest E. Down was selected to become its first commander. The brigade was assigned the existing 4th Parachute Battalion, transferred from the 1st Parachute Brigade,Ferguson, p. 8 and two new battalions converted from normal line infantry battalions to parachute duties: the 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion, converted from the 7th Battalion, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders in May 1942; and the 6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion, converted from the 10th Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers in August 1942.Horn, p. 270 Operations The 2nd Parachute Brigade trained in the United Kingdom until June 1943, when they left for North Africa, alongside the 1st Airlanding Brigade. On arrival the two brigades were joined by the 1st Parachute Brigade, which had already been carrying out independent operations in the area during the Tunisia Campaign, and by the 4th Parachute Brigade, which had been forming in the Middle East. The 1st Airborne Division, now commanded by Major General George Frederick \\"Hoppy\\" Hopkinson, and with one air-landing and three parachute brigades, was based at Oran, preparing for the Allied invasion of Sicily under the command of the British Eighth Army, commanded by General Sir Bernard Montgomery.Ferguson, p. 11 During the invasion the 1st Airborne Division was to conduct three brigade- scale airborne operations: the Ponte Grande road bridge south of Syracuse was to be captured by the 1st Airlanding Brigade, the port of Augusta was to be seized by the 2nd Parachute Brigade, and finally the Primasole Bridge over the River Simeto was to be taken and secured by the 1st Parachute Brigade.Harclerode, p. 256 A lack of transport aircraft reduced the number of men that could be deployed, and the 2nd Parachute Brigade remained in Tunisia in a reserve role. Fighting ended in Sicily on 17 August without use of the brigade; they were, however, selected to take part in Operation Slapstick, an amphibious landing at the port of Taranto on mainland Italy. The brigade left Bizerta on 8 September, the day before the Italian surrender, and landed unopposed. Their only casualties were 58 men from the 6th Parachute Battalion who drowned after their transport ship, HMS Abdiel, hit a mine in the harbour.Ferguson, p. 13 While the 4th Parachute Brigade pushed inland, the 2nd Brigade assumed responsibility for securing the port and surrounding area. During fierce fighting around the town and airfield of Gioia del Colle the division's General Officer Commanding (GOC), Major General Hopkinson, was killed in action and replaced by Brigadier Down. Command of the 2nd Parachute Brigade was given to Brigadier Charles Pritchard. The British 1st Airborne Division was withdrawn to England soon after, in preparation for Operation Overlord, codename for the Allied invasion of Normandy, leaving the 2nd Parachute Brigade in Italy as an independent parachute brigade that came under command of the 2nd New Zealand Division. To support an independent role the brigade was assigned its own artillery with nine 6-pounder anti-tank guns and eight 75mm pack howitzers.Rottman, p. 15 They also had their own engineers and other support units were attached, including a pathfinder platoon and a glider squadron. Independent Parachute Brigade 4th Parachute Battalion mortar team in action, Italy 1944. On 2 December 1943 the 2nd Parachute Brigade formed the left flank of the 2nd New Zealand Division during the advance towards Orsogna. The New Zealanders were relieved by the 8th Indian Infantry Division, and the brigade continued the advance under their command.Pal, p. 212 The brigade temporarily returned to the 2nd New Zealand Division on 16 January, then fought to the Sangro with the 8th Indian Division again, before going into the reserve at Guardia, from the end of March. The brigade returned to the front line and took part in the Battle of Monte Cassino on 4 April, once again coming under command of the 2nd New Zealand Division.Cole, p. 58 The 2nd Brigade's next parachute operation was Operation Hasty in June 1944. This was a small diversionary raid carried out by sixty men from the 6th Parachute Battalion. They were dropped into the area between Sora and Avezzano, their objective being to harass the Germans withdrawing to the Gothic Line. The mission was a success: a German brigade was diverted to hunt the small force, and a German division was retained on rear-area security duties instead of going into the front line. In June 1944, the brigade was released from the Eighth Army and joined the 1st Airborne Task Force for airborne operations in the south of France. France The 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade carried out a brigade-sized parachute landing during Operation Dragoon. On 15 August 1944 the brigade's pathfinders landed in the south of France and set up Eureka beacons to guide the main brigade force to their drop zones. Despite the pathfinders' success at marking the drop zones, only seventy-three planes placed their parachutists in the correct location. The brigade commanding officer and eighty men were landed near Fayence, as were the 5th (Scottish) Battalion's commanding officer, with half of battalion headquarters, 'C' Company, and 'D' Company. Other men were landed as far away as Cannes. The dispersed landings resulted in only about forty percent of the 4th Battalion making it to the brigade forming-up point. Only seventy percent of the 6th (Welch) Battalion and only a single company of the 5th (Scottish) Battalion had arrived. The brigade headquarters was established at Le Mitan with the 5th (Scottish) Battalion company by 04:00, and by 07:30 the 4th Battalion had occupied the heights at Le Muy. The 6th (Welch) Battalion occupied La Motte and, when the Germans at Clastron surrendered, moved a company into the village. Le Serres was captured by 'C' Company, 4th Battalion, as was the bridge over the River Naturby on the road to Le Muy. At the drop zone the pathfinders and Royal Engineers were removing anti-glider poles so that the brigade's glider force could land. The gliders, except for those carrying the anti-tank battery, which were unable to locate the site in the heavy mist and had returned to Italy, landed successfully at 09:20. The other gliders and towing aircraft had circled until the mist cleared. It was the sight of the gliders landing that persuaded the Germans at Clastron to surrender. By 10:15 the brigade had achieved all its objectives apart from capturing Le Muy, which had been allocated to the 5th (Scottish) Battalion. Units of the brigade fought off several counter-attacks supported by the 64th Airlanding Battery's guns. The missing men continued to come into the brigade's area during the morning, and contact was made with American units who had dropped west and south of them. Men continued to arrive in the brigade area, and by 16:00 the 4th Battalion could muster over two companies while the 6th (Welch) Battalion had over 300 men. Patrols were sent out to ambush German convoys retreating from Le Muy and to reconnoitre the town. At 18:00 the brigade anti-tank battery arrived by glider with two American battalions and other supporting units. Patrolling continued over the night of 15/16 August, and Le Muy was captured by an American battalion at 15:30. At the same time 115 men of the 5th (Scottish) Battalion arrived in the brigade area. On the morning of 18 August units of the American 36th Infantry Division, advancing from the coast, reached Le Muy. The 2nd Brigade then moved to the Frejus area, on 20 August; Cannes was liberated on 25 August. The next day the brigade sailed for Naples arriving on 28 August. Greece On its return to Italy the 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade was sent to Rome on 3 September, and moved again on 8 September to a camp near Taranto to prepare for a possible mission in Greece, Operation Manna.Cole, p. 65 The Russian advance in the east had forced the Germans to withdraw from Greece or be cut off from support and reinforcements.Ferguson, p. 14 Over the night of 12/13 October 1944 'C' Company of the 4th Parachute Battalion, were parachuted onto Megara airfield near Athens to prepare a landing strip for the follow-up waves from the rest of the brigade.Cole, p. 67 The company sustained several casualties while landing in adverse weather conditions that forced the remainder of the brigade to delay their arrival for another two days.

British paratroopers of the 2nd Independent Para Brigade disembarking from landing craft assault at Salonika, 8 November 1944. Once the brigade had deployed it advanced towards Athens, entering the city on 15 October, just behind the 2nd Commando Brigade. They fought the retreating Germans for the next three months, advancing from Athens to Salonika, where elements of the 2nd Para Brigade arrived by landing craft on 8 November.Cole, p. 72 While in Greece the brigade also participated in the occupation of Athens, maintaining order and providing supplies to the population. Having been moved to Italy, the brigade had to return to Greece immediately after the outbreak of the Greek Civil War in December, becoming involved in several fights, suffering heavy casualties. The brigade was joined in Greece by the British 23rd Armoured Brigade.Ferguson, p. 15 During the civil war the brigade was involved in street fighting in Athens until the communist Greek People's Liberation Army fighters were forced out of the capital in January 1945; they also provided food and other supplies to around 20,000 people in Athens every day.Ferguson, pp. 14‚Äì15 Post war In January 1945 the 2nd Parachute Brigade was withdrawn from further operations and relocated to Italy. After the war ended in Europe, the brigade returned to the United Kingdom and reformed as a conventional brigade, losing its additional supporting arms. It had been planned for the brigade to go to the Far East and join the 44th Indian Airborne Division, fighting in Burma against the Japanese. However, the war ended before they departed, and instead the brigade was assigned to the 6th Airborne Division, which had been sent to Palestine. Leaving the United Kingdom the brigade arrived in Palestine on 22 October, and were based around Gaza.Wilson, p. 22 The 6th Airborne Division had been named the Imperial Strategic Reserve and served in Egypt until September 1945, when it moved to Palestine in an internal-security role, to counter the activities of the Jewish paramilitary movements Hagana, Palmach, Irgun and the Stern Gang.Ferguson, p. 34 When the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded in November 1945, the 6th became the only airborne division in the British Army. While in Palestine in December 1947, the 4th Parachute Battalion was amalgamated with the 6th (Royal Welch) Battalion and renamed the 4th/6th Parachute Battalion.Wilson, p. 152 To fill the vacancy created by this amalgamation, the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion was assigned to the 2nd Parachute Brigade. 16th Independent Parachute Brigade Group In February 1948 the 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade left the 6th Airborne Division and moved to Germany, becoming part of the British Army of the Rhine.Watson and Rinaldi, p. 3 The 6th Airborne Division was disbanded soon afterwards, leaving the 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade as the only brigade-sized airborne formation in the British Army. Being the only surviving parachute formation, in June its battalions were renumbered: the 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion became the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment, while the 4th/6th Parachute Battalion became the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment, and the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion became the 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment. On 25 June 1948, the brigade was re-designated the 16th Independent Parachute Brigade Group, taking the numbers \\"1\\" and \\"6\\" from the two wartime airborne divisions.

Street in Bayonne, New Jersey. The parish was founded in 1889 by 50 German immigrant families from Bavaria and was named after Emperor Henry II of the Holy Roman Empire. It is one of the first Catholic parishes in Bayonne and is part of the Archdiocese of Newark. Description The first church building, a wooden structure, was built in 1890 on the northeast corner of Avenue D (now Broadway) and 26th Street (site of the current Bayonne Post Office). The first pastor was the Reverend Alois Heller. St. Henry's merged with St. Thomas' Church when the latter closed in 1892. This caused a controversy in Bayonne over what language should be spoken at masses. It was decided by Bishop Wigger in favor of the German-Catholics. Construction of the current English Gothic style church, designed by architect Thomas Henry Poole, began in 1911, and was patterned after Durham Cathedral in England. The design of the building is cruciform or cross-shaped similar to most medieval churches of Europe. The building exterior is made of limestone from Bedford, Indiana. The ground was broken for the new church by Fr. Peter E. Reilly on June 17, 1911 and the cornerstone was laid by Bishop O'Connor on September 15, 1912. The new church was dedicated on May 30, 1915. After the death of Fr. Reilly in 1919, Fr. Michael Mulligan took over the parish. He bought a pulpit of carrara marble for $4,000. Later, he bought an old school building from Bayonne and opened the St. Henry's Grammar School (since closed). Monsignor Mulligan (he had been elevated to the Monsignorate in 1954) retired in 1966 and died the following year. Fr. Charles J. Covert took over the parish and immediately modernized the facility at a cost of $550,000 with an additional $150,000 for the school. Fr. Covert died in 1979. The interior of St. Henry's includes a Botticino marble main altar which was imported from Pietrasanta, Italy, a pulpit of carrara marble and the 28 foot high baldachino made of oak from the Balkans, lindenwood from Bavaria and local pine which, along with the screen behind the altar, were made in Urtij√´i, Italy. Over 30,000 pieces of goldleaf were used in the gilding. During the church renovations done from 1968 to 1969, the plain windows were replaced with stained glass windows, done in 11th century Byzantine style, including one of Pope John XXIII. These were created by Simon Berasaluce, who has been called \\"a modern master with a medieval touch\\". The last pastor of St. Henry's Church was Bishop Thomas A. Donato who died in 2015.

John Calvin McCoy (September 28, 1811 - September 2, 1889) is considered the \\"father of Kansas City.\\" McCoy was born in Vincennes, Indiana. He studied at Transylvania College in Lexington, Kentucky, during 1826-1827. He accompanied his parents Isaac and Christiana (Polk) McCoy to Kansas City to perform Baptist missionary work in 1830. In 1833, John McCoy built a two-story cabin at what is today 444 Westport Road on the northeast corner of Pennsylvania Avenue. McCoy opened a store for travelers on the Santa Fe and Oregon trails. He named the area Westport because it was the last settlement before travelers ventured into the Territory of Kansas. McCoy's store was four miles from the Missouri River in the hills away from the floodplain. He established a dock at a rocky point in the river between Main and Grand Street, which came to be called Westport Landing. He followed a trail that was to become Broadway to reach it. The natural wharf proved to be quite popular but the land surrounding it belonged to Gabriel Prudhomme, a farmer. After Prudhomme was murdered in 1831, his property was auctioned in 1838 to settle the estate. McCoy and 13 others formed a company to buy the property. Their company was called the Town of Kansas after the French description of the area around the town, chez les Canses (\\"home of the Kansa\\" Indians). In 1853, when the town was officially charted by the state of Missouri, the English pronunciation of the French name was applied to the new \\"City of Kansas,\\" which later became known as Kansas City. A statue of McCoy stands today in Pioneer Park at Westport and Broadway. Also depicted in the statue are the pioneers Alexander Majors and Jim Bridger. Sculpture by Thomas L. Beard.

During its session of 1874, the Canadian Parliament appropriated $6,000 for a lighthouse at Wood Islands, as an aid of marine traffic in the Strait and for fishers in and around Wood Islands harbour. A contract for $3,000 was entered into with Archibald McKay of Moncton, NB, who abandoned the project after having received $900 for his work. The Department of Marine hired Donald MacMillian to complete the work; the then eight-room structure was finished during the autumn of 1876 and put into operation on 1 November 1876.

See: http://www.tourismpei.com/confederation-trail/iona-murray-harbour Reviewed: 01.10.2015 The Northumberland Ferries Limited and The Wood Islands Service Ever since the federal government established a subsidized ferry service in 1917 between Borden, PEI and Cape Tormentine, NB under Crown corporation Canadian National Railways, residents of eastern Prince Edward Island had lobbied their elected representatives for an alternative service to Pictou, Nova Scotia; the Borden - Cape Tormentine ferry having replaced a government steamship service between Georgetown and Pictou. In 1935, Prime Minister MacKenzie King brought Saskatchewan politician Charles A. Dunning back into federal politics to economically resurrect the nation from the Great Depression and appointed him Minister of Finance. Dunning was elected by acclamation as a parachute candidate in the dual riding of Queen's (it had 2 MPs at the time). Residents seized upon this opportunity and elicited a promise from the King government to establish a ferry service from southeastern PEI to Caribou, NS, near the town of Pictou. The location of the PEI terminal was a source of controversy as the deepest water on the PEI shore suitable for a ferry dock was located just east of the Kings County boundary in Little Sands, Prince Edward Island, several kilometres east of Wood Islands. However, given that Dunning represented the riding of Queen's, the Little Sands location was rejected in favour of a terminal located at Wood Islands, to better help the residents of his electoral district, despite its inferior water depth. The federal government set about building a ferry port in the community's small harbour, dredging sand from the harbour bottom and constructing wharves. A new privately owned company, Northumberland Ferries Limited, was established to manage and operate the seasonal ferry service under license for the federal government, which retained ownership of the terminals, real property and vessels. Dunning left politics in 1939 but the ferry service was instituted nevertheless in 1941 and has continued uninterrupted under the NFL banner to the present day, using several used and new vessels over the decades. Today it remains the only ferry service to the mainland after Confederation Bridge opened in 1997. A major redevelopment of the Wood Islands terminal took place in the early 1990s before the new high capacity M/V Confederation entered service in 1993. The federal government continues providing financial assistance to NFL under the terms of a contribution agreement, while the company leases two ferry terminals and vessels from the federal government. Today, though seasonal, it remains the only ferry service to the mainland.See: http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/policy/anre- menu-3043.htm The Wood Islands and Area Development Corporation and The Wood Islands Welcome Centre In 2002 Premier Binns opened a provincial Visitor Information Centre at the intersection of Route 1 and Route 4, located one- half kilometre from the Wood Islands ferry terminal, to welcome the more than 350,000 ferry passengers travel through Wood Islands each year. Then with a corporate Liquor Control Commission retail outlet, the new centre also incorporated a community room, two rental shops and a seasonal museum, which became the responsibility of the Wood Islands and Area Development Corporation.

The Grand Lodge of Prince Edward Island received its warrant on February 24, 1862, authorizing the formation of provincial grand lodges. The Association was first planted on PEI in the year 1849 under the authority of the grand master of Nova Scotia. The first Scarlet warrant was granted July 24, 1859, at which time there were four primary lodges in the province, one in Wood Islands. Sword Lodge: Number 1007, at Woodville, for Belfast District, had Hector C. McMillan as its Master c1863 to c1891, later Malcom Munn was Master in c1905. The Lodge was located at the junction of then 'Upper Wood Island Road' ‚Äì now Stewart Road and Wood Island Road. The lodge building survives and has been moved to a local farm acreage.See: http://canadianorangehistoricalsite.com/PEIOrangeism.php Wood Islands Pioneer Cemetery. This cemetery on Pioneer Cemetery Road stands in a 'thin' forested area between the Trans-Canada Highway and the Northumberland Strait. The cemetery is a historical footprint of the early Selkirk settlers; as it is believed the cemetery dates from 1807. An 1834 land conveyance refers to the site as \\"the old burial ground\\". The site ceased to be used in 1910, and was restored in 1972. Today, a Celtic cross inscribed with the badge of 'Clan McMillan' is located near the entrance. A Murdoch McMillan was interred in 1810, but the oldest remaining headstone is that of Hector McMillan, who died in 1819. Approximately 33 headstones survive; however, several of these are illegible. Other families interred here include members of the Bell, McNeill, McRae, Munn, Smith, Currie, McDonald, and McKay families, names familiar to arrivals on the Spencer in 1806. The McMillans were part of the migration of Scottish Highlanders sponsored by Lord Selkirk, coming originally from Colonsay in Argyle in 1806. They thought to settle in Little Sands, however, having set fishing nets just off shore of Wood Islands, from where the cemetery is now located, and were rewarded with a bountiful catch, they decided to make their home in Wood Islands.See: http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=12872&pid;=0Wood Islands Pioneer Cemetery 1807‚Äî1910: Ann Bonnell See: http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pictou/wdislan.htmGovernment of PEI: Island Information See: http://www.gov.pe.ca/infopei/index.php3?number=2654‚ü®=E Wood Islands Presbyterian Church. In the 1860s a smaller pioneer church came to be replaced by the new church in the centre of the Belle Creek / Wood Islands community, on land from the original Dougal Munn acreage. This, the 'new' church burned to the ground on 28 November 1943 and was then replaced an edifice designed by J.E. Harris. The dedication service of the now current church took place on 10 May 1946. Dr. MacGregor of Pictou County, NS, first ministered to the Presbyterian congregation of Woodville (Wood Islands) between 1806 and 1819. The Rev. John MacLennan served from 1825 to 1843, when most of the congregation became Free Church of Scotland. The congregation continued to receive services from itinerant ministers, and students from the Free Church Presbytery in Pictou, NS, until The Rev. Donald MacNeil was installed as minister in 1857. For many years the charge was called the 'Woodville and Little Sands Presbyterian Congregation' until the PEI Presbytery separated off Little Sands and amalgamated it with Murray Harbour South in 1891. Financial difficulties in the 1930s and 1940s eventually led to the sharing of a minister by Wood Islands, Culloden, and Murray Harbour South. The Wood Islands Presbyterian Church now draws its congregation from Flat River, Wood Islands, Culloden, Belle River, Iris, and Melville.Archives Council of Prince Edward Island: Fonds Acc4596, See: http://www.archives.pe.ca/peiain/fondsdetail.php3?number=1030124‚ü®=E&fonds;=Acc4596 Wood Island West.

The website focus is to provide people with information on saving money in the form of deals, tips and journalistic articles. In September 2012, it was bought by the moneysupermarket.com group for a value of ¬£87M. Since 2015, Lewis has taken on the role of executive chairman, overseeing 100 staff and editors reviewing and updating the site. The website provides financial advice to interested consumers through numerous media, initially solely through a weekly \\"Money Tips\\" email, and expanding to include detailed guides and free tools. The website also aims to accelerate day-to-day financial communication, facilitated through the forum and campaigning work.  Overview  MoneySavingExpert.com declares itself as the UK's biggest independent financial advisory website, with 13 million users a month. This may appear to be incorrect, noting that the organisation is wholly owned by the Moneysupermarket.com group, following its purchase in September 2012. However, MoneySavingExpert.com remains editorially independent, as part of the contractually binding Editorial Code. Although the website was set up in 2003 solely to share tips rather than make money, the rapid rate of expansion within the first year meant the sheer running costs of the website required revenue generation. The websites' fundamental set up as a free-to-use advisory service that doesn't allow advertisement means that all links and products on the pages has been selected through independent research by the team. As such, to generate revenue the website contains affiliate links to merchants, which are tracked when clicked and may generate a payment to the site. This can be on a pay per click basis, pay per user basis or other methods deemed appropriate. The choice of which content to advertise is made in part based on which will generate the most money, dependent upon whether it is the most efficient and beneficial item for consumers. However, these links are technologically created, meaning they are not entirely error-free. MoneySavingExpert.com maintains ethical integrity in its commitment to notifying consumers as to which links are affiliated, indicated by an asterisk (*) after the link. With the growth of the business and accelerating website traffic, these links have generated profit beyond the running costs of the website. The website's profits are estimated to reach up to ¬£100 on the sale of financial products through these affiliate links. In the year ending 31 October 2011, MSE had revenue of ¬£16m and profits of ¬£12.6m. A small proportion of this income is donated to charity; of this, two thirds is donated to the MSE Charity, and the rest is donated to five other nominated charities by members. Lewis has also caused disquiet in Affiliate Marketing circles for promoting cashback sites where the consumer gets the money for affiliate payments for themselves. This is likely to have had a substantial impact on the revenue generated by the site. Site elements The MoneySavingExpert.com franchise consists of four key tools:  Weekly email  Martin's Free Money Tips email is reportedly sent to over thirteen million recipients every week and contains a mixture of editorial articles and the best and current tips from users in the site's Forums. The aim of this email is to keep consumers up to date as two-thirds of deals released expire within the first week of release.  MoneySavingExpert.com Best Buy Guides & Articles  The main site has a large variety of \\"Best Buy\\" guides, designed to be extremely detailed to provide specific tips and top products to consumers to increase ease of use.  \\"MoneySaving\\" Tools  MoneySavingExpert.com creates and hosts their own price comparison tools including a flight price checker, Premium Bonds calculator and a budget planner.  The MoneySavingExpert.com Forums  The site has numerous forums, with tens of millions of posts and well over a million users in total, split into subject boards used to discuss different matters related to money and finance (including loans, benefits, debt, shopping, etc.), as well as a few forums for general chat. It is important to note that these are considered open forums, meaning that advice or information within the posts are not checked by the website team, and thus not considered 'published', thereby absolving MoneySavingExpert.com of legal liability for any false claims or incorrect advice given. It reasons this as it would be impractical and an unnecessary burden on resources to read and approve the thousands of comments that are made on the site daily. Instead, MoneySavingExpert.com uses a 'report-a-post' system, whereby users report specific posts they deem to be inappropriate for the advice forum. These can include offensive posts, posts unrelated to monetary activities or posts by companies promoting their own products. Only after the posts are reported are they deemed legally published by the website. Petitions The website has launched three petitions: *The first aimed to have the secured loan adverts banned from children's television which the site claims received 45,000 signatures. This campaign was the subject of a Parliamentary early day motion. * The second, launched in collaboration with the Consumer Credit Counselling Service and Credit Action, appealed to Carol Vorderman to stop appearing in secured loan advertising. This petition received over 80,000 signatures. * The third was in conjunction with the site's work on Bank Charges, and was placed on the UK Prime Minister's website, attracting over 70,000 signatures. Both of these campaigns have been the subject of Parliamentary early day motions. Campaigns In August 2006 the site started to develop a system to check whether people were in the correct council tax band. Over a number of months an increasing number of people reported ¬£1000s in backdated payouts. On 26 January 2007 Martin Lewis presented a Tonight programme on this following up the successes from the site; it rated 4.5 million viewers and saw the site covered in many national newspapers including the full front pages of the Express and Metro. During late 2005, the issue of reclaiming unfair bank charges was highlighted and a few small websites started to highlight the issue.

One of the first features of the new park, an ornamental 'Old English Garden' was created. It was later renamed the 'Sexby Garden' after Colonel J.J.Sexby the London County Council's first Chief Officer of Parks. It was re-developed in 1936 and the paths re-laid with york stone paving. During World War II, part of the Common became a Prisoner of War camp for Italian prisoners of war. The River Peck was largely enclosed in 1823. Today, parts of this stream can still be seen on the west side of Peckham Rye Park. The Park includes a Japanese garden and hosts a weekly Parkrun event.

It was originally transmitted on 15 November 1974. Synopsis Mainwaring's platoon have to signpost the route for a military convoy passing through the area. However, an abandoned steam roller and fairground organ trailer are blocking the route, which threatens to plunge the convoy into chaos. Plot In the church hall yard, Jones is showing off his newly restored butchers' van to the platoon. Mainwaring arrives with some very important news: three battalions of regular troops are to move into the Walmington and Eastgate areas as part of the divisional scheme, and as the signposts have been removed, the platoon have been asked to signpost the route to allow the convoys to pass through safely. While explaining the operation, Mainwaring damages Jones' van, by drawing on its side (ruining the paintwork) and knocking off part of the running board on the driver's side, as well as later damaging the horn. The operation goes without further hitches until the men are collected and Mainwaring orders Jones to drive them back to the church hall. En route, they find the road blocked by an abandoned steam roller and fairground organ trailer, and a note from its driver reveals that he has gone to get some coal. Rather than wait for him to return, Mainwaring decides to drive around the vehicles. Whilst doing so, Jones's van gets stuck in the mud and before long it is joined by Hodges' van, his motorbike and side-car (driven by the Verger, who is taking Mrs Fox to pick bluebells, much to the chagrin of Jones and the Verger's wife) and a coach carrying the Vicar, the Verger's wife and pensioners on a day trip (who take the opportunity to dance to the organ when Pike, who is trying to move the trailer, accidentally starts it up after unhitching it from the steam roller). With time running out, it falls to Godfrey's Auntie Elsie to save the day and divert the convoy.

When this episode was adapted for radio, Harold Snoad and Michael Knowles made significant changes to the script, the most significant being that rather than being held up by a steam roller, the platoon is held up by a circus truck containing an elephant, hence the retitling as \\"A Jumbo-Sized Problem\\".

No-frills spirit and quick turnarounds Connelly, president, and Hayward, board chairman, were the majority owners of the airline, and as such could hold sway concerning how the company would operate. Running on slim operating margins, Southwest Airways was a no-frills airline decades before low-cost carriers became common. The airline speeded ground operations to the point where a DC-3 could load and discharge passengers and begin taxiing for takeoff 90 seconds after coming to a stop (adding six minutes if fuel is needed). To save money, the airline had its own pilots do the refueling instead of paying airport personnel. Ground time was reduced by keeping one engine running while a male purser quickly escorted passengers to and from the plane. Pacific's DC-3s were modified with an 'airstair', a door that doubled as a staircase for passengers.Photograph of a passenger using a Southwest Airways DC-3 airstair. Retrieved August 14, 2009. The airstair eliminated waiting for a ground crew to roll a wheeled staircase up to the plane. In August 1953 a daily Southwest DC-3 was scheduled SFO to LAX in 3 hours and 45 minutes with eight stops. Pioneering instrument landings The airline's innovative spirit extended into air safety, as well: in December 1947, a Southwest Airways DC-3 flying into the coastal town of Arcata made the world's first blind landing by a scheduled commercial airliner using ground-controlled approach radar, instrument landing system devices, and fog investigation and dispersal operation oil-burning units adjacent to the runway. By the following year, the airline had made 1,200 routine instrument landings at the often fog-shrouded Arcata airport. By 1948 Southwest had a fleet of 10 planes, all Douglas DC-3s, and was flying between 24 airports in California and Oregon, becoming the second-largest feeder airline in the United States.

The aircraft struck a ridge in the Refugio Pass region of the Santa Ynez Mountains at an elevation of , far below the minimum nighttime altitude of prescribed for the route over that stretch of mountains. The Civil Aeronautics Board was unable to determine the cause. Fleet expansion By late 1952, the airline's fleet included eight secondhand piston-engined Martin 2-0-2s, faster and larger than the DC-3.Killion, 1997, p. 142The Martin 2-0-2s had airstairs like the DC-3, but unlike the DC-3s, the Martin planes had tricycle landing gear, so the airstair was underneath the tail instead of on the side of the fuselage.

Development Arbitrage pricing theory describes the theoretical relationship between information that is known to market participants about a particular equity (e.g., a common stock share of a particular company) and the price of that equity. Under the efficient market hypothesis, equity prices are expected in the aggregate to reflect all relevant information at a given time. Market participants with superior information are expected to exploit that information until share prices have effectively impounded the information. Therefore, in the aggregate, a portion of changes in a company's share price is expected to result from changes in the relevant information available to the market. The ERC is an estimate of the change in a company's stock price due to the information provided in a company's earnings announcement. The ERC is expressed mathematically as follows: UR = a + b(\\\\text{ern}-u) + e :UR = the unexpected return :a = benchmark rate :b = earning response coefficient :(ern-u) = (actual earnings less expected earnings) = unexpected earnings :e = random movement Earnings response coefficient research attempts to identify and explain the differential market response to earnings information of different firms. An Earnings response coefficient measures the extent of security‚Äôs abnormal market return in response to the unexpected component of reported earnings of the firm issuing that security.Scott, W. R. (2014). Financial accounting theory. Toronto: Pearson. 7th ed, p 163. The relationship between stock returns to profit to determine the extent of the response that occurs to as the Earnings Response Coefficient (ERC). Some studies reveal there are four factors that affect Earnings Response Coefficient (ERC), namely : beta, capital structure, persistence and growth. Reasons Reasons for differential market response: #Beta: The more risk related to the firm's expected returns the lower will be the investor's reactions to a given amount of unexpected earnings.(Note: beta shows risk of a security so you can assume that a high beta means a high risk). #Capital structure: ERC for a highly leveraged firm is lower than for a firm with little or no debt, Any good news passed on means that the debt holders get this benefit instead of the investors. (Thus it is important to disclose the nature & magnitude of financial instruments including off-balance sheet). #Persistence: Source of increase in current earnings affects the ERC: If earnings are expected to persist into the future this will result in a higher ERC. If the component in the earnings is non-persistent (i.e. unusual, non recurring items) this will result in lower ERC. #Accruals quality: The manager has considerable control over the amounts and timing of accruals. If the manager uses this control over accruals to influence the amount of reported net income, they are called discretionary accruals.Scott, W. R. (2014). Financial accounting theory. Toronto: Pearson. #Growth Opportunities: Suppose that current net income reveals unexpectedly high profitability for some of the firm's recent investment projects. This may indicate to the market that the firm will enjoy strong growth in the future, hence ERC will be high.Scott, W. R. (2014). Financial accounting theory. Toronto: Pearson. #The informativeness of price: Because prices lead earnings, and market prices aggregates all publicly known information about the firm, much of which the accounting system recognizes with a lag. Consequently, the more informative price is, the less the information content of current accounting earnings will be, other things equal, hence the lower the ERC.Scott, W. R. (2014). Financial accounting theory. Toronto: Pearson. Use & Debate ERCs are used primarily in research in accounting and finance. In particular, ERCs have been used in research in positive accounting, a branch of financial accounting research, as they theoretically describe how markets react to different information events. Research in Finance has used ERCs to study, among other things, how different investors react to information events.Hotchkiss, Edith S. and Deon Strickland, 2003. \\"Does Shareholder Composition Matter? Evidence from the Market Reaction to Corporate Earnings Announcements,\\" Journal of Finance, 58(4), pp. 1469-1498. There is some debate concerning the true nature and strength of the ERC relationship. As demonstrated in the above model, the ERC is generally considered to be the slope coefficient of a linear equation between unexpected earnings and equity return. However, certain research results suggest that the relationship is nonlinear.Freeman, Robert and Senyo Tse, 1992. \\"A Nonlinear Model of Security Price Responses to Unexpected Earnings,\\" Journal of Accounting Research, Vol. 30 No. 2 (Autumn), pp. 185-209.

Vandaleur's father is dead, having lost the family fortune, and Vandaleur only has the android which, if it works correctly, can bring in more than enough income to support him in the manner to which he had become accustomed. However, the android becomes erratic when his immediate environment exceeds a certain temperature - when the android is put to work in a foundry, it begins to sing and subsequently pours molten metal on the human supervisor when she investigates the singing.

His father died when he was 18 months old, and Bill and his brother were raised by their mother through the Great Depression. He attended Ellsworth and Loras Colleges and served in the United States Army. He became involved in radio with KRNT in Des Moines during World War II. In 1946, he first held a television broadcast at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines. Riley stayed with KRNT until 1973, when he became an executive for Hawkeye Cablevision (now Mediacom). Riley began the Bill Riley Iowa State Fair Talent Search in 1959. He went from town to town in Iowa, holding talent competitions for Iowans age 2 to 21. The best of these would then come to compete at the Iowa State Fair. Bill Riley was the host and cheerleader for these competitions until he retired in 1996. The following year, his son, Bill Riley, Jr., took over hosting duties, and the Plaza Stage where the contest was held was renamed the Anne and Bill Riley Stage. Many of the talent show participants have gone on to successful careers, such as Simon Estes and Carrie McDowell. A total of 110 contestants participated in the talent search in 2006. Riley was inducted into the Iowa Rock 'n Roll Music Association's Hall of Fame in 2004. In 2006, the state fair honored Riley as the grand marshal of the fair parade.

It is endemic to Norfolk Island between New Caledonia and New Zealand and it is regarded as either extremely rare or possibly extinct. Since 2000 the Australian government has considered the species extinct.Department of the Environment and Heritage. EPBC Act List of Threatened Fauna Description It reaches a length up 13 to 14 centimetres and therefore it is one of the largest white-eyes. The wingspan is 7.5 cm and the weight is about 30 grams. Its appearance is characterized by a pale green head, an olive green coloured neck and white throat and belly parts. A further feature is a conspicuous eye ring of white feathers. Males and females are coloured similarly. Its diet consists of fruits, berries, nectar, and insects. Its only habitat is a 5 km¬≤ large forested area around Mount Pitt on Norfolk Island where it lives solitary. In the breeding season from October to December the couple build a cup-shaped nest in which two white eggs are laid. The incubation time lasts eleven days and another eleven days later the juveniles became fully fledged. Threats The largest threats are habitat destruction and invasive species. The decline of the white-chested white-eye began as the introduced silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) became naturalized on Norfolk Island. It displaced the white-chested white-eye from its breeding range. From the 1940s rats destroyed the nests and clearing of the forests led to a severe decline in the population to only 50 individuals in 1962. In 1986 the Norfolk Island National Park was established to save this bird from extinction, but because of the fluctuation of this species, surveys often remained unsuccessful. In 1978 only four individuals were monitored, and a sighting in 2000 resulted in one individual; bird watchers claimed to have seen the bird in 2005,Hirschfeld, E. (editor) (2007): Rare Birds Yearbook 2008, Magdig Media Ltd., Shrewsbury, England however official surveys have not recorded the species since 1980.Department of the Environment and Heritage.

Career Faty was born in Villeneuve-Saint-Georges, France. His football career began with Strasbourg in the 2004‚Äì05 season of the Championnat de France Amateurs, in which he played 27 matches and scored one goal. The following year he earned fourteen more caps in the CFA, along with twelve matches for RC Strasbourg's professional squad, five being in cup competition. His Ligue 1 debut was on 29 October 2005. During 2005‚Äì06 UEFA Cup, A.S. Roma faced Strasbourg in the group stage, and Luciano Spalletti noted the young Frenchman, so the following year, due to Strasbourg's relegation to Ligue 2 and Olivier Dacourt's departure from Roma to Inter Milan, Faty was signed to giallorossi for a fee of 350,000 Euros for a five-year contract. He made his Champions League debut with Roma against Olympiacos at the Karaisk√°kis Stadium. He was given the job of man-marking the former Brazilian star Rivaldo. Roma eventually won the match 1‚Äì0. He employed this role so well and efficiently that Luciano Spalletti praised him and many tabloids and newspapers named him the \\"new\\" Patrick Vieira. At the end of his first season in Serie A he said that, though he was satisfied of his experience at A.S. Roma, he would like to transfer on loan to have more chances to play and thus, on 6 July, he moved to German team Bayer Leverkusen for a two-year loan. In January 2008, he was loaned to FC Nantes, where he stayed until the end of the 2008‚Äì09 Ligue 1 season. On 31 July 2010, it was revealed that Faty would be joining English Premier League club Blackburn Rovers on trial for an undisclosed length of time. The trial came to nothing as Faty then signed for Greek club Aris Salonica. In his first season in Thessaloniki (2010‚Äì2011), Faty played in about 35 matches and scored two goals (against Kerkyra and Rosenborg BK). In 2012, he joined Ajaccio. On 18 August 2014, Faty signed a four-year contract with Standard Li√®ge. In the summer 2018, Faty joined Turkish club MKE Ankarag√ºc√º. On 9 May 2019, he announced on Instagram, that he had terminated his contract with the club, according to him because he was left out of the squad and had not received his salary. On 16 September 2020, Faty joined Reggina 1914, signing a three-year contract. Personal life He is the younger brother of Jacques Faty, who plays for Australian club Central Coast Mariners FC. Though they were born in France, their father is Senegalese and their mother is from Cape Verde. His father is Muslim and his mother is Catholic, while Faty converted to Islam at age 20, while playing for Roma, and hopes to end his career in a Gulf country to increase his faith.

In addition, Terry Gilliam's 1988 film The Adventures of Baron Munchausen contains several elements inspired by this story, particularly the opening sequence set at the court of the Grand Turk. Synopsis A couple had three sons, and the youngest was a fool. One day, the Tsar declared that whoever made him a ship that could sail through the air would marry his daughter. The older two set out, with everything their parents could give them; then the youngest set out as well, despite their ridicule and being given less fine food. He met a little man and, when the man asked to share, he hesitated only because it was not fit. But when he opened it, the food had become fine. The man told him how to strike a tree with an axe; then, he was not to look at it but fall to his knees. When he was lifted up, he would find the tree had been turned into a boat, and could fly it to the Tsar's palace, but he should give anyone who asked a lift. He obeyed. On the way, he met and gave a lift to a man who was listening to everything in the world, a man who hopped on one leg so that he would not reach the end of the world in one bound, a man who could shoot a bird at a hundred miles, a man who needed a great basket of bread for his breakfast, a man whose thirst could not be sated by a lake, a man with a bundle of wood that would become soldiers, and a man with straw that would make everything cold. At the Tsar's place, the Tsar did not want to marry the princess to a peasant. He decided to send him to the end of the world to get healing water, before the Tsar finished his dinner. But the man who could hear heard him and told the youngest son, who lamented his fate. The fleet-footed man went after it. He fell asleep by the spring, and the huntsman shot the tree he was leaning against to wake him up, and he brought back the water in time. The Tsar then ordered him to eat twelve oxen and twelve tons of bread, but the glutton ate them all. The Tsar then ordered him to drink forty casks of wine, with forty gallons each, but the thirsty man drank them all. The Tsar said that the betrothal would be announced after the youngest son bathed, and went to have him stifled in the bath by heat. The straw cooled it, saving him. The King demanded that he present him with an army on the spot, and with the wood, the youngest son had it and threatened to attack if the Tsar did not agree. The Tsar had him dressed in fine clothing, and the princess fell in love with him on sight. They were married, and even the glutton and the thirsty man had enough to eat and drink at the feast.

His father succeeded to the throne in 1866. Ernst pursued a career in the army and retired as colonel in the Prussian cavalry.

The roosters have a glossy blackish green plumage and are highly prized for their loud clear calls and striking colouration, while the hens are usually dull and infertile. Bekisars were traditionally used by the original inhabitants of the Sunda Islands as symbolic or spiritual mascots on outrigger canoes, and consequently spread over a wide area. The original hybrids are rarely fertile (and hens are generally sterile), but backcrosses with domestic chicken are sometimes achieved and thus several landraces of Pacific chickens have some Bekisar ancestry. While the hybrid is only of historical interest in most regions, on Java it is still being produced as a more stereotyped breed with several local varieties, known as Ayam Bekisar. History Background The wild green junglefowl is a mangrove forest adapted species. Unlike the red junglefowl, the ancestor of most domestic chickens, it is adapted for life with little fresh water. During the dry season, and also on arid volcanic islands, the green junglefowl gets most of its water from dew in the coastal fog on fruits and insects. It also feeds on aquatic animals washed up on the shores and littoral pools, which red junglefowl are unable to do. At low tide, green junglefowl forage for starfish, small crabs, copepods and detritus. At high tide they fly to mangrove islets to roost. The far-carrying cries of the male green junglefowl can be heard over the breakers, even though their calls' volume is quite low in comparison to that of a domestic fowl or red junglefowl. Hybridisation The practice of hybridisation is so ancient that it is not known precisely where it began. Modern Sundanese and Javanese people claim that it first occurred in the Kangean Islands in the Java Sea. The native peoples of the Sunda Archipelago learned that they could persuade young, unpaired wild green junglefowl males to mate with domestic game hens. Development √¶neus-type Ayam Bekisar The progeny were used for communication between canoes. Each rooster has a unique voice, due to its hybrid ancestry. A rooster would be selected for its unusual voice, and hoisted up the mast of the canoe in a special bamboo basket. From their elevated baskets the roosters crowed incessantly in prolonged shrieking matches. The calls combine the prolonged notes of the green junglefowl with the added volume of domestic fowl, whose wild ancestors' voices had to be heard through dense vegetation. The Bekisar's voice can often be heard for two miles over the sea. The seafaring cultures took to keeping these male Bekisars on their canoes at all times. Spread When the native peoples of Java and the Sunda Islands migrated to Oceania and beyond, they brought with them dogs, pigs, yams, coconuts and chickens. Each migration brought a few dozen semi- domestic game fowl, not unlike those seen today running feral in tropical Asian villages. Anthropologists have provided evidence that only a very few boats in any flotilla carried domestic animals. Each seafaring vessel would, however, have carried at least two or three cages with Bekisars aboard. The chieftain and warriors may have carried even more Bekisars on each of their vessels. Nearly every new migration of seafaring people brought game fowl (the semi-domestic chickens descended from the Indonesian red junglefowl Gallus bankiva) to their new island homes. The Bekisar roosters were also present in sufficient number to significantly affect each island's native base population of feral fowl. An escaped Bekisar was next to impossible to capture. A Bekisar rooster released into a tropical mangrove forested island in Oceania or the South Pacific would easily re-adapt to the wild, as if it were a wild green junglefowl. Establishment of feral populations Many of the more remote, typhoon-prone islands with very small or failed human colonies are the naturalized homes of wild junglefowl, described as violet-colored junglefowl by early European naturalists and considered a new species. Backcrossing of many generations of the hybrid Bekisar males with feral domestic game hens must occur before fertile females are produced. Female hybrid offspring of green junglefowl crossed with domestic fowl are always sterile, laying eggs which are incapable of being fertilized by either green or red junglefowl, or by domestic fowl. This means that backcrossing would be a common mode of self- perpetuation. When competing clans, tribal wars, disease and typhoons extirpated or very nearly exterminated human populations or forced migrations, feral fowl, pigs and dogs would often remain on these remote islands. Natural predators such as monitor lizards, seabirds, pythons and other predators would hunt out the feral chickens with the most domesticated traits. Those incapable of flying or running rapidly would not live long enough to reproduce. Those incapable of surviving long periods without fresh water would also perish, and those lacking the appropriate instincts to survive frequent typhoons would also be selected against. Local adaptation The Bekisar, with the progeny they generated by interbreeding with feral chickens, have adapted to local conditions. With each successive generation of backcrossing, the odds of a fertile hybrid female increase. At a certain point a genetic equilibrium is reached, and a fresh generation of viable females, capable of reproducing, is produced. Over the long run, some of the more remote islands, such as New Caledonia, Ponape, Marquesas, Rapa and Rapa Nui, became populated with flocks unique in appearance, not closely resembling either parental form. When successive migrations of Polynesians carrying domestic fowl (derived from red junglefowl) appeared on these islands, most of the violaceous traits vanished through genetic swamping, only persisting on the most isolated islands. From these isolated island populations unique breeds have developed, in particular on Ponape, the Marquesas and Rapa Nui (Easter Island). The famous Araucana hens, named after the Araucanian Indians of Chile, are derived from these breeds. These breeds produce tinted blue, grey, lilac and green eggs. The green junglefowl is the only species of junglefowl that produces tinted eggs. In popular culture The Bekisar is the faunal symbol of East Java, a province of Indonesia. The male is used in East Java, Bali and the surrounding islands in popular vocal competitions; this practice has caused the decline of wild green junglefowl populations. References * Beebe, William.

Education  Koedinger received his bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, working with Richard Lehrer, and his M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. He then obtained his Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology from Carnegie Mellon University. His doctoral advisor was John Robert Anderson.  Career  Koedinger worked as a Research Scientist in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Eventually, Koedinger became an Associate Professor and subsequently a Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. He has had many prestigious graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, in particular Neil Heffernan and Vincent Aleven.  Research  Knowledge- Learning-Instruction Framework (KLI Framework) Koedinger studied and developed the KLI framework of Learning Science. In 2012, Koedinger, along with his colleague Albert Corbett from the HCII and Charles Perfetti from the University of Pittsburgh, introduced the Knowledge-Learning-Instruction framework. The propositions within the KLI framework can help generate research questions within specific domains and instructional situations that, with further work, yield precise and falsifiable predictions. The KLI framework relates a set of observable and unobservable events: Learning Events, Instructional Events, Assessment Events and Knowledge Components. * Instructional Events: Variations, typically planned, in the learning environment that are intended to produce learning. Instructional Events cause Learning Events. * Learning Events: Changes in cognitive and brain states that can be inferred from data, but cannot be directly observed or directly controlled. * Assessment Events: Involve student responses that are evaluated. Assessment Events are usually test items that can be directly observed, but they can also be embedded in the context of instruction. * Knowledge Components: A description of a mental structure or process that a learner uses, alone or in combination with other knowledge components, to accomplish steps in a task or a problem. A knowledge component is also closely related to an assessment event, since it is an acquired unit of cognitive function or structure that can be inferred from performance on a set of related tasks. Cognitive Tutor Koedinger has a huge contribution to the Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), and developed several cognitive tutor software to aid the traditional classroom learning. Among which the \\"Cognitive Tutor Algebra\\" is one of the precursors of the ITS. In 2006, Koedinger and Albert Corbett invented the Cognitive Tutor Algebra from their Cognitive Tutor research. It is intended to provide students with immediate step by step hints and feedback, which traditional classroom practice can not provide. In 2011, Koedinger, and his colleagues Ido Roll, Vincent Aleven and Bruce McLaren introduced the Help Tutor, an enhanced version of the Geometry Cognitive Tutor that is capable of giving immediate metacognitive feedback on students' help- seeking errors. As an enhanced version, the Help Tutor teaches help-seeking skills by giving metacognitive feedback on students' help-seeking errors in the context of learning a domain-specific problem-solving skill. The Help Tutor messages include only domain-independent metacognitive content for several reasons: to encourage students to focus more on the metacognitive feedback (and not be distracted by domain content), to help students generalize the help-seeking skills, and to make the Help Tutor reusable with different Cognitive Tutors.

After the First world war, the modern state of Iraq was established under a British mandate. The three vilayets together were home to a wide variety of different ethnic and religious groups. In contrast with relatively ethnic and religious tolerance under Ottoman rule, the British unified the population of the three vilayets in one nation-state and appointed, in consistence with their ‚ÄòSharifan Solution‚Äô, the Sunni Islam oriented Faisal I of Iraq as king. The decision to implement Sunni leadership, despite a Sunni minority in Iraq, created an exclusion of other religious and ethnic groups such as Shi‚Äôites, Kurds, and other religious minorities. With the granted independence of the state of Iraq in 1932, the struggle to create an Iraqi national identity became more apparent. Although Faisal I repeatedly tried to bring cultural values and uses of Sunni, Shi'ite and other populations together within the context of Pan-Arabism, the outcome was a more visible distinction between the ethnic and religious groups in Iraq. On the one hand, Shi'ites, Kurds and other sects refused to give up their cultural values and uses. While on the other hand, the Sunnis in power tried to abolish these values and uses in cohesion with Pan-Arabism. Eventually, this has led to a clearer consolidation of the different communities which resuted in the enhancement of division among Iraq its population. Furthermore, Iraq its independence and the struggle to create a national identity resulted in different unsuccessful tribal uprisings and clashes in the 1930s. The government repeatedly managed to knock down the riots and maintain its hegemony. The first officially documented attempt to outline sectarian frustrations after the establishment of the Iraqi state came with the Najaf Charter document in 1935. In this 12-point manifesto, a group of Shi'ite lawyers expressed their discontent about sectarian discrimination against the majority of the Shi'ite population and called for appointing Shi'ite judges and courts in predominantly Shi'ite areas and development projects throughout the country, especially in the South. Although this manifesto was the first effort to present the sectarian elite with political frustrations, aspirations, and demands of the Shi'ites, they remained unheard. After 1932, the Iraqi government kept expending its bureaucracy and thus, enhanced Sunni control over the state's machinery. Although greater control of the government meant fewer uprisings and rioting, sectarian tensions of the Iraqi population kept growing. In 1958, a group of army officers under the leadership of General Abd al-Karim Qasim overthrew the monarchy and installed the Republic of Iraq. General Abd al-Karim Qasim was from a mixed Sunni-Shi'ite background and abolished the practice of limiting Shi'ites and other ethnic backgrounds into the military. This made him partly popular but the implementation of other policies meant tension between his regime and religious leaders. Land reforms and reforms regarding family law undermined the power of religious leaders and landlords. This eventually led to a bloody overthrowing of the Qassim regime in February 1963. A variety of Arab Nationalist army officers, primarily Sunni affiliated officers, restored not only loyalties of communalism and sectarianism but also the political power of Sunni Arab nationalists. Although Abdul Salam Arif was appointed president due to its popularity, real political power was in the hands of the Ba‚Äôath Party, which started a reign of suppression, prosecution, and executions. Approximately 3000 people were executed by the paramilitary force of the Ba'ath Party, the National Guards. Abdul Salam Arif became increasingly discontented about the excessive use of violence by the state and overthrew Ba‚Äôath rule with a coup in November 1963. However, sectarian policies remained in place and further enhanced sectarian and inter-communal tensions. Within this tense atmosphere, different officers and cliques planned military coups to overthrow Arif's rule and seize power. Eventually, by the use of two consecutive military coups in 1968, the Ba‚Äôath Party seized power for the second time in a decade.  The making of national identity under Ba'ath rule  With the resurrection of power by the Ba‚Äôath Party, Iraq entered a new stage of nation-building. In the 1970s the government under the leadership of then vice-president Saddam Hussein nationalized Iraq's oil industry. With the revenues from the export of oil, Iraq started a project of modernization and nation-building. At that time Hussein was not yet the head of the state but was widely seen as the dominant political actor. Apart from investments in infrastructure and its industry, the Iraqi government launched a program to invest in basic public goods such as schools, Universities, and hospitals. By doing this, Iraq developed itself as a welfare state and encouraged the growth of the middle class at the cost of tribal allegiances. The economic expansion in Iraq pathed the way to the process of nation-building. Citizens throughout Iraq benefited from economic advancement, incomes rose and social mobility became possible, regardless of their ethnic or religious background. Lisa Blaydes, a professor of political science at Stanford university describes two main strategies of cultivating national identity under Ba‚Äôath rule throughout the 1970s and 80s. The first strategy was to enhance social integration through the success of state-sponsored development programs, which were made possible by the growth of the Iraqi economy. The second strategy was to de- emphasis sectarian identity. From the start of the Ba‚Äôath rule, the party's legitimacy was strongly bound to the tribal and regional allies of Hussein. Foremost, because without these allies, a coup was always around the corner. From 1972 onwards, Hussein actively tried to abolish the emphasis on a sectarian identity by incorporating figures from different ethnic and religious backgrounds in his governmental apparatus. Hereby Hussein made appointments based on loyalty and trust rather than on people's ethnic or religious background. While the Shi'ites and Kurds did not reach the highest levels of political power, they still managed to reach high levels of influence within the regime.  Sectarian violence at the beginning of Ba‚Äôath Rule  Under Hussein's rule, the system in which citizens, organizations, and parties were monitored intensified. The strategy behind the extensive monitoring of figures was linked to the fear of losing political dominance over Iraq. Figures who were suspected of being disloyal to Ba‚Äôath rule could face years of imprisonment. Although the Ba‚Äôath party managed to include different ethnic and religious groups in their governmental system after 1968, opposition and violence with a sectarian nature did occur and was at times highly vocal. For example, different Kurdish rebel groups unsuccessfully tried to initiate rioting and independence in northern Iraq known as the second Iraq-Kurdish war. During the same period, the Shi'ite Da‚Äôwa party gained popularity in Iraq. After its establishment in 1970, party activists initiated different riots, most noteworthy the riots in 1974 and 1977. The riots were quickly repressed by the regime due to its scale and scope. So, on the one hand, the Ba‚Äôath party propagated national identity and included different ethnic and religious groups in their government, while on the other hand, constructing a tense atmosphere where there was no room for disloyalty or opposition. When violence did break out, the Iraqi government was able to quickly crackdown the outbreaks due to its military supremacy and resources.  Sectarian violence from 1979 until 2003  From the 1970s, sectarian tensions brewed underneath the surface. Primarily a vast majority of the Shi'ites were discontent about their governmental exclusion. Although Hussein propagated the abolishment of sectarian ideologies and the inclusion of different sects in the military and other governmental institutions, by 1977 only Sunnis maintained positions in the Revolutionary Command Council, the highest form of authority. Moreover, the pursuit of enemies and disloyal people to the regime intensified. For example, Kurdish, Shi'ite, and Iranian citizens were being deported out of Iraq with the motivation of being foreigners, which was often referred to as an act of sectarian cleansing at that time. The sectarian tensions surfaced with the outbreak of the Iranian revolution and the Iraq-Iran War in 1980. In 1979 the Iranian revolution took place under the leading of Shi'ite Grand ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The Iranian monarch Shah Reza Pahlavi was overthrown, pathing the way to the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Khomeini started a propaganda campaign aimed towards Shii'tes in Iraq to follow the ideologies of the Iranian revolution and to revolt against the Sunni dominated regime of Hussein to eventually overthrow it. In 1980, Hussein declared war on Iran and tried to annex the oil-rich Iranian Khuzestan province. Although Hussein had political and economic motivations to go to war with Iran as he later declared in a series of interviews with the FBI: ‚ÄòIran had broken the 1975 Algiers agreement concerning the waterway and interfered in Iraqi politics, this left Iraq no choice but to fight‚Äô. The war was also fought on religious grounds. As Hussein later recalls: ‚ÄòKhomeini believed the Shi'ite population in Southern Iraq would follow him, especially during the war with Iraq. But, they did not welcome him and remained loyal, fighting the Iranians‚Äô. During the eight years of war, Hussein and his Ba‚Äôath party tried to gain support from citizens with a Shi'ite, Kurdish, and Sunni background by making generous contributions to their communities. For example financial support to Shi'ite Waqf's and the restoring of Imam Ali‚Äôs tomb. Despite far-reaching efforts by Hussein and his Ba‚Äôath party to gain support among different sects, sectarian tensions kept rising, mainly due to the Iraq-Iran War.. During the war years, Shi'ite soldiers, officers, and citizens flew the country and sought refuge elsewhere, primarily in Iran and Syria. In addition, war casualties on both the Sunni and Shi'ites sides further enhanced rivalry among these groups. Although the majority of people with a Kurdish background were not subjected to high casualty rates during the war, Hussein saw the activities from Kurdish political groups as a betrayal against his regime. The groups were being accused of cross-border military and intelligence cooperation with Iran. The Ba‚Äôath regime punished these activist groups in northern Iraq by using extensive violence. This echoed further into their community, contributing to a stronger sentiment of sectarian division. In the aftermath of the Iraq-Iran War, sectarian distrust exploded and became more visible during the first Gulf War, initiated by the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. Coalition forces responded by bombing Iraqi targets, mainly in the southern regions of Iraq. These counterattacks affected particularly Shi'ites, which endowed both casualties and damage to infrastructure. Following the retreat from Kuwait in 1991, uprisings erupted throughout 14 of the 18 provinces in Iraq. The rebels were mainly Shi'ites and attacked the existing political power but also their social exclusion under Ba‚Äôath rule. The uprisings were predominantly religious in nature with the protesters showing pictures of Shi'ite religious leaders, such as Khomeini, and religious symbols. As researcher and journalist Khalil Osman describes the uprisings: \\"The rebellion in southern Iraq was marked by a vigorous assertion of Shi‚Äôite identity, featuring overtly Shi‚Äôite religious symbolism and rhetoric.‚Ä¶ But the passionate and strident assertion of Shi‚Äôite identity vis-√†-vis the despotic Ba‚Äôathist state gave rise to fears and feelings of exclusion among Sunnis, which resulted in their loss of sympathy for the rebellion.\\" The uprisings were eventually suppressed by the use of brutal force and extensive violence by the regime. Although the restoration of Sunni state control and security proofed to be a hurdle for the Ba‚Äôath regime, they managed to restore order. Besides different assassinations on political and religious influential figures in the 1990s, widespread sectarian violence in Iraq exploded again after the removal of Hussein from office in 2003. Sectarian violence between 2003 and 2005 After the 2003 invasion of Iraq in which Hussein and his Ba‚Äôath party were removed from office, sectarian violence increased and later exploded following the parliamentary elections in 2005 into a Civil War. Due to the political power vacuum after the removal of Hussein, different factions with different religious and ethnic backgrounds tried to gain power. The major parties where: The Mahdi Army, The Ba‚Äôath Loyalist, Kurdish Separatists, and Al-Qaeda. The Shi‚Äôite Mahdi army under the leadership of Muqtada al-Sadr fought against the US-led coalition forces following their ideology of an Iraqi state without Western influence. In turn, Al-Qaeda and other Sunni orientated militias fought against the Mahdi army, smaller Shi‚Äôite factions, and the coalition forces. During the power vacuum from 2003 to 2005, attacks between the parties, militias, and coalition forces occurred frequently, causing tremendous amounts of casualties on all sides although, exact numbers are uncertain. After the parliamentary elections of 2005 in which a coalition of Shi‚Äôite parties won, sectarian violence exploded, pushing Iraq into a Civil War (see also: Sectarian violence in Iraq (2006‚Äì2009)).

It is a form of jousting where the adversaries, carrying a lance and protected only by a shield, stand on a platform on the stern of a boat. The boat is propelled by oarsmen or, in some cases, a motor may be used. The aim of the sport is to send the adversary into the water whilst maintaining one's own balance on the platform. The jousters stand on a wooden platform on their boats. As the two competing boats draw level with each other, each jouster, protected by their shield, uses their lance to push their opponent off the platform and into the water. The exact rules of the contest vary from region to region and country to country. Ancient world The oldest representations of water jousting have been found on bas-reliefs dating from the Ancient Egyptians (2780‚Äì2380 BC). It would seem however, that these relate more to a form of brawling than a leisure activity; given that the jousters are wearing no form of protection and carry gaffes armed with two points at their end. Evidence of jousting is subsequently found in Ancient Greece. The Greeks introduced the practice into Sicily where the Latins, great lovers of all kinds of spectacle, immediately adopted it. Indeed, there are countless signs of jousting in the Roman Empire, especially during staged naumachia (literally \\"naval combat\\"). The latter featured naval re-enactments and other water-sports that took place in arenas designed to be flooded for the purpose. In all likelihood, the Romans introduced these types of games throughout their empire. Evidence for this comes from the description of a f√™te held at Strasbourg in 303 in honour of Emperor Diocletian. Some historians argue, however, for an introduction of the games from the foundation of Massilia, a Greek colony founded in 570 BC and later to become the French city of Marseille. Development in France After Roman times, there is no record of water jousting until the twelfth century. It is possible that the sport survived during the intervening period in communities close to water, but it is not mentioned anywhere. The oldest document dating from the post Roman period in France refers to a jousting tournament in Lyon on 2 June 1177, to commemorate the millennium of the Christian martyrs of Lyon and Vienna. Another document tells us that \\"in 1270 in Aigues-Mortes, crusaders, soldiers and sailors, awaiting embarkation for the Holy Land with King Louis IX (Saint Louis), faced off in single combat mounted on small boats. Documents both written and illustrated become more numerous in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, citing games in Sologne, in Toulon, and more generally throughout the Mediterranean coast. On the Languedoc coast in Southern France, jousts have been practised regularly since the seventeenth century. There is evidence that the inauguration of the port of S√®te in 1666 gave rise to a jousting tournament. In the Rhone-Alps region, it was reported 13 April 1507 that the fishermen of St Vincent (Lyon) jousted on the Sa√¥ne at St. Jean to entertain Queen Anne of Brittany and her people. In 1536, a show of jousting is given by the sailors in Saint-Just-Saint-Rambert (Loire), in honour of Fran√ßois I. Games are also held on the Sa√¥ne in 1548 for Henri II and Catherine of Medici. The nineteenth century was a watershed in the history of jousting on the Rhone with the creation of certain societies. The original object of these societies was not primarily concerned with the practice of jousting. Rather, they were societies of sailors who came together to bring relief to residents during the frequent floods of the Rhone. They practised jousting at local festivals, thus perpetuating the tradition passed down from generation to generation by these proud watermen. In 1899, the Federal Union of French Societies of Swimming and Rescue was created. The Union held the first jousting championship in France in 1901 on the in Lyon, although this was somewhat rudimentary. In 1905, the Union was replaced by the National Federation of Swimming and Rescue, which also holds regional championships. A French postage stamp depicting water jousting was issued in 1958. It was not until 1960 that the game was officially recognized as a sport by the government. The current federation (Federation of French Jousting and Water Rescue) was born in 1964 following a strong disagreement with the former federation, which did not sufficiently develop the game as a sport. The sport is currently practised throughout France, notably in Languedoc, Provence, the Rhone Valley, around Paris and in Alsace. Jousting festivals are also held in Cognac, Accolay, Merville and in Brittany. Each region has its own methods of jousting and its own rules of engagement.

It is the administrative centre of the Berezne Raion. Population:  Overview  Berezne (historically known also as Bere≈∫no as well as , and ) was established in 1446 within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Since the Union of Lublin the town was part of the Kingdom of Poland, where it remained until the Partitions of Poland by Austria, Prussia and Russia. The town was overrun by Khmelnytsky in the Khmelnytsky Uprising of 1648 and experienced bloody pogroms which took many innocent lives. Annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793, Berezne was ceded to Poland in 1919‚Äì21 during the Peace of Riga. In the Second Polish Republic there was a garrison of the Border Protection Corps Bere≈∫ne Battalion in the town. Until the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, Bere≈∫ne belonged the Wo≈Çy≈Ñ Voivodeship's County of Kostopol. According to the Polish census of 1931, the whole county had a population of 159,600 inhabitants, including 102,609 Ukrainians (overwhelmingly in villages: at 100,651), 34,450 Poles (32,189 in villages), and 10,786 Jews, along with significant numbers of Germans, Czechs, and Ruthenians. Interwar period In the Second Polish Republic during the interwar period, Bere≈∫ne bore the distinction of being one of the two cities in Poland with the most Jewish inhabitants in the country. Some 94.6 percent of Bere≈∫ne overall population of 2,494 inhabitants (or 2,360 persons), were Jewish. The second largest Jewish presence in Poland, amounting to 94.4 percent of the town's population, was in Luboml. Berezne park Berezne Forestry College World War II Bere≈∫ne was overrun by the Soviets in 1939. In 1941 the German Wehrmacht entered the town as part of Operation Barbarossa. Immediately almost all Jewish homes were set on fire and the Jews were left with virtually no possessions. The Jews of Berezne, who then numbered approximately 3,000, were forced to live in three buildings surrounded by walls. This small area became known as the local ghetto. In the following year the Ukrainian Hilfsverwaltung together with the Germans, used Jews for slave labor, and hardly any food was supplied for them. The Jews forced to work in the forest were frequently tortured. Those who escaped related accounts of the slave labor and beatings. In August 1942 a detachment of SD entered the town. Immediately the Jews received even more severe beatings. Three days later all Jews that could be found were taken from the ghetto into the woods, where they were forced to dig a large pit. They were shot and buried at the same location. Many of the Jews that escaped into the woods were caught and delivered to the Germans by the local Ukrainians, who aided the SS in the process of \\"ethnic cleansing\\" known as the Holocaust by bullets. In 1943, during the Volhynian Genocide, 96 ethnic Poles of Berezne were murdered by Ukrainian nationalists of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. The first attack on the town took place in June 1943. Other attacks occurred in the second half of that year, and as a result Polish survivors fled to larger towns, such as Rowne. In June 1945 the remaining Poles were forced to leave Berezne in accordance with the Allied treaties. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, culminating with Ukrainian independence, Ber√©zne became the administrative centre of the Berezne Raion of western Ukraine. The Holocaust survivors Only a few hundred of the Jews of Berezne survived the Holocaust. Most of them escaped from the forest camp to the village of Mazorisz (Mazorish) where the Polish villagers that gave them food and shelter in return for firewood used for heating. Some left the area together with the Communists, before the Nazis entered. For many years there stood a monument memorializing the over 3,000 men, women, and children who were slaughtered by the Nazis and local Ukrainian collaborators, at the site of their mass grave. Corresponding to common Soviet practice, the Soviet authorities refused to mention on the monument that the 3,680 murdered victims were Jews, instead describing them as \\"citizens of the Soviet Union\\".

The school teaches boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 18 and has around 1,400 pupils and 84 teachers. It retains a high position within regional league tables. In 2016 Prince Henry's had the third highest results for GCSEs in Leeds. Also in 2016 PHGS was the best state school in Leeds for A Level results. The school has repeatedly received a 'good' rating from Ofsted with outstanding features, however has in the past received criticism for the state of the old school building.http://www.wharfedaleobserver.co.uk/news/10283630.Prince_Henry_s_School_at_Otley_praised_by_inspectors/- Despite the name, Prince Henry's is now a state-funded academy school. History Origins The money for the school originally came from the will of Thomas Cave, a local cloth merchant, in 1603. Thomas Cave left ¬£250 for the establishment of a school in the Parish of Otley on the condition that an equal amount of money was raised by the local community within four years. A Royal Charter was granted by King James I on 30 April 1607, just four days before the deadline laid out in the will expired. The royal charter was granted after a petition by local residents, including Thomas Fairfax and the local vicar, Rev. William Harrison, who became the first school master. A 1610 court case from York shows that the relatives of Thomas Cave and the executors of the will were reluctant to release the money from the will because of the delay in acquiring land for the school, which went against the terms attached to the money in the will. The court found in favour of the parishioners of Otley. The money however still did not arrive in the parish which led to a second court case in 1611 which eventually had the money being obtained and used to buy land for the school. ¬£380 was used to buy land from James and Mary Green near Thirsk, this land was then rented back to the couple and their descendants for a thousand years in exchange for 40 marks a year, which was used to pay wages for the school staff. According to the Royal Charter, which established the school, the original name of the school was \\"The Free Grammar School of Prince Henry at Otley\\". Free in this context meant that the school was free from church jurisdiction and free to choose their own curriculum. The School was named after King James's son Henry Frederick Stuart, Prince of Wales, who was at the time the heir to the throne, but died in 1612. Teaching began in 1611 in the Old Vicarage as a permanent site had not yet been procured. The original statues of the school in 1611 state that the school master must be fluent in both Latin and Greek and that they would be paid ¬£20 a year for their work, there was no increase in this amount until 1861. The school day at the time lasted from 7am to 5pm, with two hours for lunch between 11am and 1pm, depending on seasonal conditions. According to the original charter the school was founded to teach both rich and poor in the local parish. Land was granted by the Archbishop of York, who had an estate in Otley, for the creation of a permanent school. The original school building was built in Manor Square and finished in 1614, this site was sold in 1883 and since then has been an art gallery and is currently a restaurant. First school The original school building was only one floor. A second floor was added in 1790 after a ¬£40 grant from the Archbishop of York. There was a further grant of ¬£16 in 1808 from the archbishop for repairs. Due to declining class sizes in later years the building was also the site of an infant school and a Sunday school. The school building was also used as a court room after 1850 until the building of the Otley Courthouse in 1874. Between 1789 and 1806 the school master was William Bawdwen, who translated the Domesday Book. An inspection of the school in 1824 found that there were around 5 pupils receiving a free education in Latin and Greek. However, a further 40 pupils received lessons in maths and English writing and grammar which their parents paid for. These subjects and the style of teaching is likely to be the same from the very beginning of the school. New scheme and closure In April 1861 a new scheme to govern the school was approved by the Court of Chancery. This scheme removed the original charter and governor system and created a charity for the school which was run by eleven trustees. The curriculum at this time composed of 'the principles of the Christian religion', Latin, French, reading, writing, arithmetic, natural philosophy, history, geography, book-keeping, land-surveying, drawing, and design and music. The school at this time was open to every boy between 7-18 from the Parish of Otley. The cost for boys under 10 was 1s 3d a week. For those over 10 the cost was 2s. The school master was to be paid ¬£20 a year as well as 75% of the school fees, with the rest going to the upkeep of the school. The introduction of fees to all pupils led to a slow decline in new students starting in the school. An inspection of the school in 1867 found that there were just 30 students, 20 of which were under the age of 12. At this time the school was open for 48 weeks a year and 30 hours a week. The school closed in 1874 due to financial issues and increased competition with other schools which were being established across the country after the Elementary Education Act 1870. The school did not reopen until 1918 despite the school trustees continued attempts to recreate the school. However, this proved difficult due to disagreements among the trustees as well as a lack of money and the unsuitability of the school house for a modern school. In 1883 the schoolhouse was sold for ¬£800 by the trustees. Reopening and later history In 1888 a new scheme under the Endowed Schools Act 1869, which had been approved in privy council by Queen Victoria, allowed the funds raised by the sale of the school to be used to give four grants of ¬£15 each, which would last for three years, and be given to local boys to attend other grammar schools in Leeds, Bradford or Ripon. By 1904, due to sound investment of the former schools finances the school was making ¬£120 a year profit, despite the fact it did not exist. The West Riding County Council in 1904 decided to build a new secondary school for the Wharfedale district in Guiseley, instead of Otley, despite hopes that Prince Henry's Grammar School could be recreated. The Board of Education planned to reopen the school in 1909, however these plans were slowed down by the County Council and the outbreak of the First World War. The new plan laid out that the school should have 15 governors managing the school, and that the school should be in or near too Otley. The new plan for the first time also allowed for girls to come to the school. The School was at this time also renamed to its present name of \\"Prince Henry's Grammar School\\". In 1909 the school still owned the property near Thirsk that it had acquired in 1611, however it was now being rented by the Earls of Harewood for the price of ¬£26 13s 4d a year. The school trust also had ¬£3000 in savings. The school governors bought the current Farnley Lane site of the school for ¬£1575, however in 1911 the County Council refused to help any further to develop the site into a school. In 1917 the MP James Hastings Duncan made a personal appeal to the Minister for Education which finally led to the reopening of the school. The school reopened after 44 years on 18 September 1918, temporarily based out of the Mechanics Institute, which later became Otley Town Hall. When it reopened there were 117 students. For the first time the school was also eligible for local and national education grants. Teaching began in the new school building on Farnley Lane in 1927. Under the Education Act 1944 Prince Henry's became the local grammar school under the Tripartite System. The victory of the Labour party in the 1964 and 1966 general elections, and the release of Circular 10/65 marked an end to the Grammar School system. In 1967 Otley Secondary Modern School joined with Prince Henry's, which then became a comprehensive school. Otley Secondary Modern School was founded in 1935 and was located in North Lane. Following the merger new buildings were constructed at the Farnley Lane site, to accommodate the extra pupils, which were opened by Prince Charles in 1970. In 2007 the school completed the integration of a rugby academy into its sixth form. In 2010 the school pioneered a race equality programme which has been rolled out across the country. The school caused controversy in 2013 by asking parents to contribute ¬£360 for each child so that the school may gave them iPads. Parents raised concerns about the cost of the scheme, whether the iPad was the best model to use and the potential threat to the concept of free education. The scheme went ahead later in 2014. Seal and motto The school seal and motto was created by Charles Fairfax, this seal is on every school uniform. The design is of a book crested with the three feathers of the Prince of Wales. On the book is the school motto Deum Pave: Tomo Cave which translates to \\"Fear God and mind thy book\\" and is likely a play on words on the name of the school founder Thomas Cave. School governors The original school governors were: *Thomas Fairfax *Guy Palmes *Sir Robert Dyneley of Bramhope *Thomas Fawkes Esq. of Farnley Hall *Christopher Cave, Yeoman of Otley *Christopher Cave, Yeoman of Menston *Jeffrey Pickard, Yeoman of Menston Other noteworthy governors have included 2nd Lord Fairfax, Charles Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax, Henry Arthington, 4th Lord Fairfax, 5th Lord Fairfax, William Palmes, and William Gabriel Davy, as well as several members of the Vavasour family, Hawkesworth family and the Fawkes family. It was customary for each governor to donate 1 Guinea upon their appointment to the upkeep of the school. Under the new scheme of 1861 the governors were replaced with trustees. These trustees were for the most part local factory owners such as Peter Garnett, Jeremiah Garnett, Thomas Hartley, William Ackroyd and William Fison, father of Frederick Fison. Specialist statuses In 1999 the school became a Specialist Language College. Since then the school has taught Spanish, French, German, Chinese and Italian to its pupils. The funding from this status has allowed the school to create new teaching resources as well as provide language lessons to local primary schools and evening courses to the community. In October 2005 Prince Henry's Grammar School became the first school in the City of Leeds to be presented with the prestigious International School Award from the British Council, as a result of staff and student-led initiatives. Building and facilities The school's current location is to the north of the River Wharfe the front of the building is an old Edwardian school house complete with clock tower. The building has received frequent additions, the most recent of which was a new science block added in May 2008. On 10 July 2008 HRH Duke of Kent visited the school to officially open the new science building. As well as unveiling a plaque to commemorate the opening, His Royal Highness spoke to students in Prince Henry's sciences, physical education and modern languages lessons. The building has been named after Walter Hargreaves Hindle, a former Otley resident who bequeathed a large sum of money to the school for the advancement of the study of science. In 2014 ¬£900,000 was used to build four new classrooms, create a new sixth form area as well as improvements to the original 1927 building. The School's sports facilities include a swimming pool, gym, several tennis courts and rugby pitches as well as two fully equipped sports halls. Extracurricular activities and school trips The school's media and music departments produce an annual musical which have been very well received; recent years have seen Les Mis√©rables, Back to the Eighties, Grease, South Pacific and Return to the Forbidden Planet performed. The music department ensembles run throughout the year and include: PHOJO (Jazz Orchestra); Concert Band; Orchestra; Senior Choir; Strings; Junior Band and 'Sing Up!' (A year 7/8 vocal group). These groups often perform at local churches in Otley and Ilkleyhttp://www.wharfedaleobserver.co.uk/news/11009421.Guys_and_Dolls_at_Prince_Henry_s_Grammar_School_proves_a_success/- as well as at art exhibition openings and in various locations abroad (France, Italy and Belgium most recently). Sporting achievements include rugby, which is a popular sport at PHGS as is netball. In the 2003‚Äì04 season the school rugby union team won the Daily Mail Under-18 Vase. The school repeatedly does well in rugby, in 2017 one team from the school was undefeated for the entire season. Other sporting activities include swimming, athletics, badminton and annual ski trips to France and the United States. The PE department also organises a biennial rugby tour to Dubai. PHGS runs foreign exchanges, as the school has strong international links in Europe, Durban, South Africa and China. The history department runs biennial trips to Russia, Italy and to the battlefields of the First World War. The language department do frequent trips and exchanges to France, Spain, Germany and China. The school is a long-term participant in the EU's Comenius exchange programme, and has worked with schools in Spain, Denmark and the Czech Republic. The school has links with regional institutions including the Royal Armouries and Leeds Metropolitan University, with whom it signed a sports facilities accord in 2008. The politics department hosts seminars run by staff from the University of Nottingham while the history department organises similar events with staff and students from the University of Leeds and University of Durham. Politics students visit Parliament every year and run a biennial regional conference on issues of popular interest. The 2010 conference focused on the general election in the form of student-orientated hustings attended by leading regional politicians. Students from the school take part in the Citizenship Foundation's national bar mock trials and a number of sixth formers are members of the debating society, which has won several national awards. Iraq War walkout controversy On 5 March 2003 prior to the Iraq War, the school suspended two Sixth formers, Sachin Sharma and Carey Davies, for trying to organise a demonstration against the war at Prince Henry's Grammar School and giving anti-war speeches in the school cafeteria. Their suspension gained national news coverage. Sachin said he had simply spoken up in favour of protesting against the potential war: \\"The majority of our school does not have democratic rights.\\" Headmaster John Steel said: \\"We value the conviction of the two students concerned, and respect the views of all members of our school community, but we cannot sanction protests during the school day when students should be in lessons.\\" Organised by BBC's Asianet Radio Station, John Steel was challenged to a live debate with Sachin Sharma. However, with the Local Education Authority declaring that it was up to schools to make its own policies regarding the period of walk outs John Steel did not take up the offer leaving Sachin an open-mic to ridicule his suspension and agitate against the war unopposed. Afterwards both students went from being indefinitely suspended to being reinstated without conditions. The sixth formers of the school were henceforth allowed to participate in antiwar activity outside of the school unrestricted. The younger students, however, were prevented from doing so. Academy controversy During 2011 school governors examined the possibility of the school becoming an Academy. There was \\"almost unanimous opposition\\" from two public meetings to the school becoming an Academy. Despite this the governors voted 10 to 9 in favour of conversion. NUT and NASUWT teachers, through fear of changes in pay and conditions, decided to strike on six days during November, with unions giving notice that 64 teachers would take part. The Unions demanded that the conversion must be halted for further consultation. The strike reached national news coverage, as well as a large amount of coverage in local news channels, newspapers and radio. Across the six days of strike action by the unions a number of teachers, students and parents protested at the school gates. On 26 November there was a protest march throughout Otley which was made up of nearly 400 members of the community. Protests continued up until the day of the conversion, and finally on 1 December the school converted to an academy. The conversion was also opposed by the local vicar, the local MP, Greg Mulholland and Otley Town Council.

It is inextricably linked to the country's pre-Hispanic (Inca) times, the country's conquest, colonial period, wars of Independence, modern history, agriculture (wine, traditional crops), culture (literature, poetry, folklore), religion, economy and politics. The Maule River marked the southern limits of the Inca Empire. Many famous men and women in Chile's history have been born in the Region http://www.diariolaprensa.cl/actualidad/singularidad-hispana-de-linares/ named after the river. The river has also lent its name to one of the viticultural regions of the country (also known as appellations), the Valley of Maule, a subregion of the Central Valley. Upper reach The river is 240 km long and its basin covers around 20,600 km¬≤. Thirty percent of the basin is located in the Andean range. It is born in Laguna del Maule in Talca Province, at an altitude of 2,200 mt in the vicinity of the border with Argentina. From that point the rivers flows westwardly and is soon joined on its left bank by one of its main tributaries, the Melado River, which is born in Laguna Dial, in Linares Province. Further on, and still in its upper course, the Maule is joined, this time on its right bank by rivers Colorado, Claro, Puelche and Cipreses. Middle reach Before arriving at the central valley, the Maule is dammed into the Colb√∫n dam lake that feeds the hydroelectric power station of the same name. Further on, the Maule is joined by the Claro (another river named Claro) and the Loncomilla. The latter flows from the south and receives several tributaries: the Putag√°n, the Achibueno - Ancoa system, the Perquilauqu√©n, the Purapel and the Cauquenes. Lower reach In its lower reaches, the river receives only one modest tributary, the Estero de los Puercos and, after flowing for nearly 250 kilometers, the Maule ends at the Pacific Ocean, north of the city of Constituci√≥n. Ecology The Maule River basin contains a number of significant flora and fauna of Chile.Cuenca del r√≠o Maule, 2004 Historically the Chilean Wine Palm, Jubaea chilensis, was present in the Maule River basin;Oasis de la Campana, 2008 however, due to expansion of the human population in this region, this endangered tree has a more restricted range that still includes some of the northern portion of the Maule Region.C. Michael Hogan, 2008  Literary allusions  The Maule has been considered as Chile's literary river par excellence. The number of poets, writers, historians, orators, playwrights, journalists as well as composers and folk musicians that have been born or have settled in the Maule Region, to which \\"the river of the fogs\\" has given its name, is quite staggering. Many Latin American stories have had the river as the main background or protagonist. Several anthologies, author's dictionaries and essays have given vivid accounts of the vast cultural wealth of the region around river Maule.http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/index.asp?id_ut=esritoresdelmaulehttp://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/documento_detalle.asp?id=MC0037551 See also * Battle of the Maule * Ramal Talca-Constituci√≥n * Founding of Talca Notes References * Universidad de Talca PDF file. * Cuenca del r√≠o Maule PDF file.

In the 1950s and early 1960s the airline expanded into Arizona, Southern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Los Angeles and Salt Lake City. Until 1978 Bonanza had the only scheduled nonstop flights between Las Vegas and Reno. It became an international airline soon before it merged with Pacific Air Lines and West Coast Airlines to form Air West, with Douglas DC-9s from Phoenix and Tucson to La Paz, Mazatl√°n and Puerto Vallarta. Air West would later be renamed Hughes Airwest. Hughes Airwest was bought out by Republic Airlines (1979‚Äì1986) in 1980. In 1986 Republic was merged into Northwest Airlines.

It was known as Bonanza Air Services in Las Vegas. Bonanza was part of a Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) effort to develop \\"local service airlines.\\" Interstate flights started in December 1949 and Bonanza's flight schedules appeared in the Official Airline Guide. In October 1951, its Douglas DC-3s served eight airports from Reno to Phoenix. By July 1952 Bonanza added seven airports west from Phoenix to Los Angeles. In 1968 it began flights to Mexico from Tucson, and by that May the airline scheduled flights to 22 airports. Like other local service air carriers, Bonanza was subsidized by the federal government. In 1962 its operating revenues of $11.0 million included $3.2 million \\"Pub. serv. rev.\\"Moody's Transportation Manual 1964 In 1959, Bonanza introduced Fairchild F-27s and unsuccessfully applied for routes to Texas.

It was built in 1853 by John Barnett and William C. Birch in a cruciform design, with decorated windows in Gothic style and a central octagonal crossing tower and spire. It was used by both St Pancras and Islington until 1896, when the Islington chapel was built. The Nonconformist chapel was built in the early 1850s by Barnett and Birch and had a six-sided lantern. It was demolished in the 20th century. The St Pancras Roman Catholic chapel (1896; now demolished) lay on the north side of Roman Road (c 540m north-east of the Islington Anglican chapel), and was in a simple Gothic style. Many of the tombs in the Roman Catholic section are decorated with angels and there are several interesting tombs, including the Melesi Mausoleum of 1914, for an early victim of a car accident. War graves St Pancras Cemetery has a war graves plot containing over 100 graves from both world wars, together with a number of headstones retrieved from graves that were scattered elsewhere in the cemetery and could not be maintained. A memorial bears the names of 27 casualties whose graves could not be marked individually, and of six First World War casualties buried in the adjacent Islington Cemetery who could not be commemorated there. In total 299 First World War Commonwealth service casualtiesincluding one unidentified Royal Navy sailorand 207 Second World War casualties are commemorated or buried here. The Victoria Cross recipient John Ross is buried here. Islington Cemetery contains the graves of 334 Commonwealth service personnel of the First and 265 of the Second World War, which are all scattered throughout the cemetery. A Screen Wall memorial in the western part of the cemetery lists names of those buried here whose graves could not be individually marked by headstones, together with those of two servicemen of the Second World War who were cremated at Islington Crematorium. Six soldiers buried in this cemetery whose graves could not be located are alternatively commemorated on stones in St Pancras Cemetery (above). Mausoleums and memorials The grade II listed Mond Mausoleum by Thomas Arthur Darcy Braddell is built in the Grecian style (based on the Temple of Nemesis) in granite and Portland stone, with a pediment supported by two fluted Ionic columns. It was built for Ludwig Mond, a German-born chemist and industrialist.https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list- entry/1001688 There is a memorial for William French who lost his life on 13 July 1896 while saving a dog from drowning in Highgate Ponds North London. The dog survived; alas Mr French did not. The monument was erected in commemoration of his brave deed and paid for by public subscription. Burials Due to the areas covered by the old parishes and the later Borough Councils, many of the burials of central/north Victorian London are contained within the cemetery. Thus it represents a large historical cross section of London from the 1850s on. There are tombs of every type and style, with the larger Victorian and Edwardian monuments strategically placed along the main drives (Viaduct Road, Circular Road, and Church Road), and at the main junctions. St Pancras and Islington Cemetery has the largest number of interments of any cemetery in the UK, with around 812,000 burials and 56,000 cremations recorded since its opening in 1854 (excluding the exhumations and re-interments from demolished churchyards which make the number reach over 1 million). There are many interesting graves at the cemetery, including one put up by the St Pancras Board to celebrate members of their parish who had reached the 100 years milestone. =Notable burials= *Henri d'Alcorn (born George Henry Stannard Allcorn), composer of 'La Varsoviana' (Ta-ra-ra-boom-de- ay), a variation on the Varsovienne. *Valentine Bambrick, VC recipient. *Mathilde Blind German-born English poet, fiction writer, biographer, essayist and literary critic. *Ford Madox Brown, Pre-Raphaelite artist. *Cora Henrietta Crippen, wife and victim of notorious murderer Dr. Crippen *Henry Croft, first \\"Pearly King\\".

It is a Site of Borough Importance for Nature Conservation, Grade II. Environmental management The London Ecology Unit has advised the owners on management aimed to conserve natural features, whilst recognising the primary use of the cemetery as a burial ground. In recent years, there has been a policy of informed indifference to areas that are not in active use for burials. The result has been a proliferation of natural wildlife. Large tracts of scrub and secondary woodland have been allowed to develop on former burial plots, supplementing the original plantings, and producing an exceptionally diverse habitat. Flora This mixed secondary woodland consists largely of sycamore and ash, with much pedunculate oak, hawthorn and willow. Some exotic ornamental trees have been introduced from time to time, including avenues of limes and horse chestnuts, Lawson's cypress, various pines, yew and monkey- puzzle. Holly and bramble woodland flora grows beneath the trees and alongside paths, including bluebells, pignut, goldilocks buttercup, cuckoo flower, bugle, and wild strawberry. These have spread from the adjacent woodland, or survived from the cemetery's prior existence as Horseshoe Farm. In the north- east corner of the cemetery, the Strawberry Vale Brook, culverted for most of its length, emerges into an open course. Wetland habitats here contain mature white willow, rushes, reedmace, marsh thistle, pendulous sedge, and great willowherb. Ornithology and zoology Birds include green and great spotted woodpeckers, treecreeper and goldcrest and kestrel. Muntjac deer are frequent visitors.

Mennonites had earlier, in 1789, founded the Chortitza Colony at the invitation of Catherine the Great.

The area is located north of the Western Esplanade, Commercial Road and Cumberland Place; east of Hill Lane; south of Archers Road; and west of Dorset street and The Avenue (A33). The area notably encompass Watts Park, Southampton Central railway station, Southampton Crown Court and the Maritime & Coastguard Agency. Today it is a popular choice of residential location for much of the student population of Southampton Solent University.  History  The name originates from a planned grand development in this area - a twelve-sided polygon that would comprise houses, hotels, assembly rooms and a tavern. The design was the brainchild of architect Jacob Leroux, who saw it as Southampton's answer to Bath's Royal Crescent. Construction began in 1768, but only the hotel and three houses were completed when one of the investors went bankrupt and the project stalled. The hotel opened in 1773, although it did not do very good business. In the Victorian era, many more houses, typical of the time, were built on the surrounding land, forming the area and buildings known as The Polygon today. The original Polygon Hotel was demolished in the 1780s; a new Polygon Hotel was constructed in Victorian times, which became a notable place to stay in Southampton, with guests including boxer Muhammad Ali, and comedians Tommy Cooper and Morecambe and Wise. Many passengers on the RMS Titanic had stayed here before sailing. The hotel fell into decline, however, and was replaced in 1999 with a block of flats.

History Hackney Empire is a grade II* listed building. The theatre was built as a music hall in 1901, designed by the architect Frank Matcham. Charlie Chaplin, W. C. Fields, Stanley Holloway, Stan Laurel, Marie Lloyd, and Julie Andrews all performed there, when the Hackney Empire was a music hall. ATV bought the theatre to use as studios in the mid-1950s, and shows such as Take Your Pick and Oh, Boy! were broadcast live. Certain episodes of Opportunity Knocks were also filmed at the theatre. Some scenes from Emergency ‚Äì Ward 10 were also filmed there. From 1963 to 1984, the theatre was used by the Mecca Organisation as a bingo hall. In 1984, Mecca found the building too expensive to maintain as a bingo hall, and it was offered to C.A.S.T., a satirical touring theatre group, headed by Claire and Roland Muldoon, as a London base. They also mounted successful variety nights headlined by a new breed of alternative comedy acts, such as Ben Elton, Dawn French, and Jennifer Saunders. The theatre was threatened with demolition, and in 1986, actor-manager Roland Muldoon mounted a campaign to acquire the freehold and to re-open the Hackney Empire as a permanent performance space; allowing the theatre to return to theatrical use for its 85th anniversary. Ralph Fiennes played Hamlet to Francesca Annis' Gertrude in Jonathan Kent's Almeida Theatre Company production of Hamlet, 28 February ‚Äì 30 March 1995; the production also transferred to the Belasco Theatre in New York City. In 1996, mime/choreographer Lindsay Kemp premiered Vari√©t√©', his first British production in over 20 years, there and Slava's Snowshow, featuring the famous Russian clown Slava Polunin, played the theatre several times. Muldoon retired in 2005 and was replaced by Simon Thomsett as chief executive. On 24 September 2009, it was announced that the theatre would close temporarily following its 2009 pantomime to allow a \\"period of reflection\\" to consider its future direction and financial position.Nosheen Iqbal, \\"London's Hackney Empire theatre to close\\", The Guardian, 24 September 2009.

Modern times The refurbished Hackney Empire built in 1901, retains the original structure, but adds modern facilities (Sept 2005) In 2001, the Empire closed for a ¬£17m refurbishment project designed by Tim Ronalds Architects with Carr and Angier acting as theatre consultants.\\"Theatres & Arts Complexes\\", Carr & Angier. It was reopened in 2004. The restoration included the addition of a 60-seat orchestra pit to make the Empire suitable for opera performances by companies such as English Touring Opera, the addition of a flytower with provision for counterweight flying and a reduction of the stage rake from 1 in 24 to 1 in 30. Among other new facilities were a studio theatre and educational and hospitality facilities, and greatly improved dressing rooms. Additionally, the Marie Lloyd public house was incorporated into the new extension. In addition to Muldoon, the comedian Griff Rhys Jones led the restoration appeal, with a large donation coming from local businessman Alan Sugar. It has produced an enormously successful and highly regarded panto since 1988. The John Bishop Show was presented and recorded at the Hackney Empire, and aired on BBC One from 30 May 2015 to 18 July 2015. Since 2014, the British Soap Awards have also been filmed at the Hackney Empire. Transport The area is served by bus routes 06, 236, 254, 276, 277, 394, N55, N253, N277.

It was only produced in one capacity--1.6 litres. Design The engine was essentially a lightly modified version of the E-series unit found in the Maxi and Allegro. The main differences over the older engine are to the sump and gearbox mounting flange, which were adapted to accept a traditional \\"end-on\\" transmission unit which had been bought from Volkswagen in place of the traditional BMC transmission-in-sump arrangement. It retains the 1.5-liter E-series' bore of along with a longer stroke. Like the E-series, it has a cast iron block and aluminium head. As with the E, the cylinders are siamesed, to fit the biggest bore cylinders possible. The combustion chambers were of Weslake's kidney-shaped design. The carburetor for the regular version was a single-venturi one with an automatic electronic choke, while the MG version received two twin Weber 40 DCNF carburetors and none of the fuel-saving electronics. Maximum power is at 5500 and 6000 rpm respectively.Renaux, p. 11 Problems The R series was mainly a stop gap, and had a very short production run that lasted barely two years. BL had been working on a more substantially revised version of the E series, but this was not ready for production in time for the Maestro's already badly delayed launch. The company was instead forced into launching the Maestro with the half-developed power unit which cost the company dearly--R-series-equipped Maestros soon gained a reputation for hot starting problems, cylinder head gasket failures (endemic to the E series also), and premature crankshaft failure. Because the E series was turned through 180 degrees in order to accommodate an end-on transmission, the R series was fitted to the Maestro with the carburettor facing the front of the car, which also led to a reputation for carburettor icing in cold weather. The endemic problem of crankshaft failure was later attributed to flexing of the crankcase ‚Äì because the E series relied upon the heavy sump/transmission unit to give additional strength to the cylinder block casting, this caused problems when a plain sump was bolted in its place.

The Sower) is a kibbutz in northern Israel established in 1936 by German Jews. It is the only kibbutz that was established by members of the movement. Located in the western rim of the Jezreel Valley, it falls under the jurisdiction of Megiddo Regional Council. In it had a population of . Geography HaZore'a is located on the western rim of the Jezreel Valley, surrounded by HaZore'a Forest to the south and west of the kibbutz, Yokneam Moshava to the north and the fields of the Jezreel Valley to the east. HaZore'a Forest is a section of the Ramot Manasseh Park planted on Menashe Heights by members of the kibbutz, working for the Jewish National Fund. The forest has around 20 million trees (Eucalyptus, Pinus halepensis, Cupressus sempervirens, Ceratonia siliqua and more). In the forest there are several recreation facilities such as paths to the Shofet River which leads to the Ein Ami spring and several lookouts. Archaeology Ein Harshat is a cave located next to the Ein Ami spring, used as a burial site, with tunnels and rooms containing inscriptions from the Roman and Byzantine periods and burial tombs dating as early as the late Bronze Age. East of the cave is the site of an ancient settlement called Tel Qiri, where remains from the Neolithic, Chalcolithic, Middle and Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age were found. History Establishment The kibbutz is the only one in Israel established by the German Werkleute movement, a Jewish socialist movement that sought to find alternatives for Jews in Germany, but in 1933, after the rise of Adolf Hitler, adopted a Labour Zionist vision of joining the Yishuv in Mandatory Palestine and establishing a kibbutz. In early 1934, the first group of pioneers arrived in Palestine. The sixty members split into two groups who received agricultural training in Mishmar HaEmek of the Kibbutz Artzi movement, and Givat Haim of the Kibbutz Meuhad movement, to learn the difference between the two movements. On 15 April 1934 the group reunited and concentrated in a Kibbutzim site in Hadera, where they chose the name HaZore'a. In Hadera the members established a tents and shacks camp, and they earned a living in Hadera's orchards, construction and laundry. The Jewish National Fund chose an area of 3,500 dunams next to the moshava of Yokneam on the foot of the Menashe Hills and Mount Carmel, as the location for the kibbutz and a fund was raised in Germany to purchase the land from the Palestine Land Development Company, which purchased the land earlier from Arab landlords from Haifa and Lebanon.Levinger, 1987, p. 153. On 3 December 1935 the community, which had 30 members, settled in a khan which was abandoned by the residents of Qira, located between Yokneam and the land purchased for the kibbutz. Because of the slow evacuation of the Arab tenants, the community first received a narrow plot of 70 dunams.Levinger, 1987, p. 161. On 15 April 1936 the construction of tents and a carpentry shop was completed and all of the members moved to the land and began fencing their territory. In July 1936 the rest of the Gar'in members joined the kibbutz. In 1938 the kibbutz members decided to join the Kibbutz Artzi movement. Early years In the wake of the slow evacuation process of the tenants, at one night in September 1936 the members expanded the kibbutz's boundaries, without obtaining permission from the authorities.Levinger, 1987, p. 162. The agriculture in the kibbutz began to develop in the sectors of cattle, crops, nursery and vegetables. The members brought water to the kibbutz via horse-drawn carriage from Mishmar HaEmek. The financial hardships caused by the lack of land led the members to go work in Haifa as carriers, housewives and housekeepers. In 1937 a cowshed was established and first cows were purchased. In 1938 a vineyard was planted. Some members of the kibbutz earned their living in Mishmar HaEmek's bakery, forestry work for the Jewish National Fund and the construction of the Tegart's Wall. The British authorities agreed to expand the kibbutz's boundaries in hundreds of dunams. This allowed the kibbutz to build a chicken coop and develop the fruit and vine sectors. The first water well was drilled. Days after the establishment of the kibbutz the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab Revolt broke out, forcing the members to temporarily sleep at the carpentry shop, whose walls were covered in gravel. The members set up a watch tower made out of wood and following shootings by Arab gangs more guard posts were set around the place which were manned all day. In 1937 a spotlight was installed in the watchtower and a weapon storage was built in the tower's first floor with permission from the authorities. During World War II members of the kibbutz served in the British Army and the Palmach. The kibbutz was used during the war as a paratrooper training camp. In 1937, the members built the first fortified concrete building: the kitchen. A shack was set up and used as a dining room. The members began paving roads around the kibbutz. In 1938, the members built a structure used for laundry and public showers. In the next years the construction and development continue as children's houses and residential buildings were built. The kibbutz was connected to Mekorot's water supply. On 6 September 1938, the British government issued an order that was supposed to allow the kibbutz and Yokneam to acquire the lands designated for the settlements on the plain region, blocked by Arab militants during the Arab Revolt. The British sent a large police and military force and the boundaries of both settlements was increased.Levinger, 1987, p. 164. HaZore'a received an additional 500 dunams. The order solved the land problem for HaZorea once and for all.Levinger, 1987, p. 165. The kibbutz began absorbing Jewish groups which enriched its social fabric with a wide range of cultural views and languages: a youth group from Germany arrived to the kibbutz (1939) and later moved to Yakum; a group of Werkleute members called \\"Mishmar HaDarom\\" moved to the kibbutz (1942) after they failed to integrate into Shamir; a group of Werkleute members who participated in the Dutch resistance (November 1944); a youth group from Bulgaria (1947); a group called \\"Erez\\" from Syria and Lebanon who arrived during the Aliyah Bet (1947); a group of Hashomer Hatzair members from the United Kingdom (1948); a group of Holocaust surviving teenagers named \\"HaOgen\\" from Poland, Yugoslavia, Romania and Hungary (1948).Hareuveni, Immanuel; Eretz Yisrael Lexicon; Ministry of Education pp.251‚Äì252 File:◊ß◊ô◊ë◊ï◊• ◊î◊ñ◊ï◊®◊¢ - ◊û◊®◊ê◊î-JNF004185.jpegHaZote‚Äôa 1945 File:◊ß◊ô◊ë◊ï◊• ◊î◊ñ◊ï◊®◊¢- ◊û◊®◊ê◊î- JNF004189.jpegHaZore‚Äôa 1945 File:◊î◊ñ◊ï◊®◊¢ (◊ô◊ß◊†◊¢◊ù) - ◊û◊ê◊í◊® ◊û◊ô◊ù- JNF033880.jpegHaZore‚Äôa 1945 File:Kibbutz Sower.jpgYiftach Brigade members from Ein Harod on training week at HaZore'a, April 1948 After Israeli Independence After the end of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli war the territory of HaZore'a was increased in thousands of dunams, which allowed further development of the agriculture. In 1961 the kibbutz built a plastic factory called \\"Plastophil\\" and the carpentry shop was turned into a company called \\"HaZorea Furniture\\" The reparations from West Germany after the Holocaust helped in the construction of these facilities. The arrival of new groups continued after the establishment of Israel. In 1952, \\"Bnei Ephraim\\", a youth group from North Africa, aged 10 and 11 were educated in the kibbutz and some of them chose to stay. In 1956 the kibbutz established an ulpan (Hebrew school) and some of its graduates chose to settle in the kibbutz. A group of Hashomer Hatzair members from the United States settled in the kibbutz in 1958 and 1959. During the 1950s it was a center of Hashomer Hatzair attempts to work with the local Arab population.Journal of Palestine Studies. 163. Volume XLI, Number 3, Spring 2012, p. 94. Economy Hazore'a furniture factory In the 1950s, the carpentry shop established in 1936 was expanded and HaZore'a Furniture Industries became a household name in Israel. Towards the end of the century, when profit margins declined, the factory was closed and the machinery was sold to a company in Amman, Jordan which continues to sell furniture under the Hazore'a brand name.News highlights, August 2013 HaZore'a industries include a plastics factory (\\"Plastopil\\"), a cowshed, an aquaculture complex (\\"HaZore'a Aquatics\\"), a quality control centre (\\"Maba\\") and various field crops. HaZore'a is undergoing a complex process of change from the model of the traditional kibbutz, where everything is equally shared, to a more modern form of settlement. Essentially, HaZore'a still operates as a socialistic society, providing uniform living conditions to kibbutz members. Nevertheless, several changes of individualistic nature have already taken place, such as privatization of services like the dining room and the electricity utility. Another example is official recognition of certain \\"residency\\" statuses, which allow some populations to reside in the kibbutz without being part of the economic collective. HaZore'a is headed by the Secretariat with two officials in charge of social issues. The Community Council of 15 kibbutz members meets once a week to discuss matters needing further attention. The final decisive authority of the kibbutz is the ballot, for which all members are eligible to vote. Education and culture Wilfrid Israel Museum HaZore'a maintains a communal dining hall and an auditorium for cultural and communal activities, such as celebrating Jewish holidays. The kibbutz issues a weekly paper titled \\"Ba'sha'ar\\" (English: \\"At the gate\\"), which serves as a medium for a variety of material concerning everyday life in the kibbutz. HaZore'a is home to Plagim Elementary School (established 1991), where children from the kibbutz and five other settlements study 1st to 6th grade. The school belongs to Megiddo Regional Council, and is part of the Israeli state education system. Another option, open to both Jews and non- Jews, is the volunteering program, offering a less obligating frame for young people to experience kibbutz life. There is also Garin Tzabar and lone soldier programs that reside on the kibbutz. HaZore'a is home to the Wilfrid Israel Museum, an archaeology and art museum whose kernel is the Asian art collection of Wilfrid Israel. The museum was designed by Alfred Mansfeld. Significant Bronze Age archaeological finds, some displayed at Wilfrid, have been made on- site at Hazorea. See also *List of Israeli museums References Bibliography *Levinger, Perez (1987).

As the generic form of a Security Target (ST), it is typically created by a user or user community and provides an implementation independent specification of information assurance security requirements. A PP is a combination of threats, security objectives, assumptions, security functional requirements (SFRs), security assurance requirements (SARs) and rationales. A PP specifies generic security evaluation criteria to substantiate vendors' claims of a given family of information system products. Among others, it typically specifies the Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL), a number 1 through 7, indicating the depth and rigor of the security evaluation, usually in the form of supporting documentation and testing, that a product meets the security requirements specified in the PP. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Security Agency (NSA) have agreed to cooperate on the development of validated U.S. government PPs.  Purpose  A PP states a security problem rigorously for a given collection of system or products, known as the Target of Evaluation (TOE) and to specify security requirements to address that problem without dictating how these requirements will be implemented. A PP may inherit requirements from one or more other PPs. In order to get a product evaluated and certified according to the CC, the product vendor has to define a Security Target (ST) which may comply with one or more PPs. In this way a PP may serve as a template for the product's ST.  Problem areas  Although the EAL is easiest for laymen to compare, its simplicity is deceptive because this number is rather meaningless without an understanding the security implications of the PP(s) and ST used for the evaluation. Technically, comparing evaluated products requires assessing both the EAL and the functional requirements. Unfortunately, interpreting the security implications of the PP for the intended application requires very strong IT security expertise. Evaluating a product is one thing, but deciding if some product's CC evaluation is adequate for a particular application is quite another. It is not obvious what trusted agency possesses the depth in IT security expertise needed to evaluate systems applicability of Common Criteria evaluated products. The problem of applying evaluations is not new. This problem was addressed decades ago by a massive research project that defined software features that could protect information, evaluated their strength, and mapped security features needed for specific operating environment risks. The results were documented in the Rainbow Series. Rather than separating the EAL and functional requirements, the Orange Book followed a less advanced approach defining functional protection capabilities and appropriate assurance requirements as single category. Seven such categories were defined in this way. Further, the Yellow Book defined a matrix of security environments and assessed the risk of each. It then established precisely what security environment was valid for each of the Orange Book categories. This approach produced an unambiguous layman's cookbook for how to determine whether a product was usable in a particular application. Loss of this application technology seems to have been an unintended consequence of the superseding of the Orange Book by the Common Criteria.

It is situated in the northern part of the city.  History of Lordshill  According to the Anglo- Saxon Charter of 956, Aldermoor, Lordswood, Lordshill and Coxford are all within the ancient boundary of the Manor of Millbrook and were farmland within the county of Hampshire, until the 20th century, when it was absorbed into Southampton.Brown, Jim (2007). \\"Shirley Warren\\", The Illustrated History of Southampton Suburbs, P108 Southampton, by 1954, continued to rapidly expand itself into Millbrook, Redbridge and Harefield, but still there was insufficient land available for more housing to satisfy its needs. Lordshill, with its was bought in 1964 to cater for the growing demand. Hampshire planners gave approval for new homes to cater for the 2,000 people at that point in time. Prior to 1964, when Hampshire County Council bought the land to make what Lordshill is today, it was little more than farmland and one dead- end road that dropped down to Old Rownhams Lane to Tanner's Brook, between the Bedwell Arms Public House and Aldermoor Road. This lane was known to be steep with water frequently running down it from various springs. It got the nickname \\"Soapsuds Alley\\" because the washerwomen living there would normally throw their soapy water on to the road and the soapy water and the natural springs would mix causing a foaming torrent. By 1967, Lordshill had been incorporated within Southampton city boundaries and has been so ever since.Brown, Jim (2007). \\"Shirley Warren\\", The Illustrated History of Southampton Suburbs, P109 In 1982, development took place to produce 60 self- contained flats that would accommodate 122 senior citizens, which would become known as Manson Court.Brown, Jim (2007). \\"Shirley Warren\\", The Illustrated History of Southampton Suburbs, P110 In August 2006, Sinclair Junior School closed its doors for the last time and the land was leased to a private housing company called Spectrum Housing Group who then demolished the old school. Nothing remains of the old junior school now, other than a memorial stone dedicated to former headteacher Mr Williams, which is on the outside of the block of flats called Williams House. Today, Berwick Close covers the whole of the former school grounds. In January 2010, Spectrum Housing Group brought the house on the corner of Sinclair Road/Berwick Close, which, in the early years, when both schools were opened, belonged to the caretaker. This house was later demolished and replaced with flats. During late 2013 and early 2014, Oaklands Community School was demolished to make way for new housing, leaving only the swimming pool and the small community room in place.http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/10298496.Oaklands_School_to_be_demolished_but_pool_may_yet_be_saved/http://www.heart.co.uk/southcoast/news/local/17m-work- starts-to-reopen-old-southampton-pool/ Lordshill today Today, Lordshill is mostly residential housing with over 4000Brown, Jim (2007). \\"Shirley Warren\\", The Illustrated History of Southampton Suburbs, P109 mixed council and private dwellings for around 12,500 people.Brown, Jim (2007). \\"Shirley Warren\\", The Illustrated History of Southampton Suburbs, P109  Education  Local education includes two primary and junior schools: Sinclair School, which is a mixed primary and junior school; and the other being Fairisle Infant School and Fairisle Junior School. A secondary school called Oasis Academy Lord's Hill, which was located on Fairisle Road, took over the former Oaklands Community School in 2008. During December 2010, plans for a new secondary school were given the go-ahead on Lordshill recreational ground called Five Acres, following the change from state run to academy run and the merge with Millbrook school. The new school building opened on September 2012.  Community  The local community areas have a mix of different shops as well as a library, church and a healthcare centre; the main shopping area is called Lordshill District Centre. Oaklands includes a swimming pool. This was closed in July 2012 after a leak was found. The Labour council leaders consulted over whether or not it would be economically viable to get it repaired at a cost of ¬£500,000. The closure of the pool meant a loss of 20 jobs. On 14 February 2014, the work needed to repair and reopen Oaklands swimming pool was approved at a cost of ¬£1.7 million which is being funded by Southampton City Council, the pool was reopened in January 2015. On 9 May 2015, Lordshill Community Centre was relocated from their old building on Andromeda Road to their new brick building on May Cromarty Road, which is sited next to Oaklands swimming pool; the centre was in use from 11 May 2015 with the official opening taking place on 23 May 2015.http://www.lordshillcommunitycentre.btck.co.uk  Transport  Buses It is served by a number of frequent bus services by First Hampshire & Dorset Southampton, Bluestar and Xelabus, providing various links to the city centre, surrounding areas and other cities, towns and villages like Romsey and Hedge End.

The area is named after the Mans Bridge which spans the River Itchen. For a considerable time, this was the southernmost crossing point of the river, before the construction of Woodmill in Swaythling. The bridge itself still stands and is a Grade II listed structure but is closed to road traffic (pedestrians and cyclists may still use it), having been replaced by a larger and more modern road bridge to carry the A27. The suburb contains a mixture of housing. The first developments, on the north side of the A27, were designed by architect Herbert Collins, whose houses are a feature of several other Southampton districts. A larger estate was later constructed on the south side, along with Mansbridge Primary School, the logo of which is the bridge itself. The residential area of Mansbridge is bordered to the west by the London to Weymouth railway line and to the east by the river. Beyond the river, Mansbridge takes on a much more rural air, with woodland to the south and water meadows to the north. The neighbouring areas are Swaythling to the west, Townhill Park to the south, and Chartwell Green to the east. A strip of green belt land separates Mansbridge from Eastleigh to the north. History The bridges There has been a bridge at Mansbridge since at least the year 932, when it was referred to as Mannysbrigge in King Athelstan's charter to the prior of St. Swithun's Priory in Winchester. In the Domesday Book of 1086, the location was recorded as Manebrige or Manesbrige Hundred, within the county of Hantscire. A wooden bridge by the name of Blak Bridge was described as being \\"a little above Woodmill\\" (i.e. upstream of Woodmill in Swaythling) by Leland in 1535‚Äì43, and this may be a reference to Mansbridge as there are no known crossing points of the river between Mansbridge and Woodmill. Saxton's map of 1575 shows the bridge at Mansbridge labelled as \\"mans bridge\\", while Speed's 1611 map refers to the hundred as Mansbridg. Blaeu's 1645 map shows Mansbridge Hundred but Morden's map of 1695 labels the bridge \\"Mansbridg\\", and shows it within the Fawley or Waltham (possibly Bishop's Waltham) Hundred. The bridges that stand at Mansbridge today are much more recent than those mentioned above; the older of the two was built in 1816 by the county council; this bridge was made of stone with a single segmental arch and decorated with a lambswool pattern. The 1816 bridge is a grade II listed building, having first been listed on 14 July 1953. It is closed to motorised traffic and forms part of National Cycle Route 23. The current bridge carrying the A27 road was constructed in 1975, and replaced a bailey bridge erected during the Second World War. The Grange The suburb of Mansbridge had at its heart, for a century, a large house called \\"The Grange.\\" The Grange had an extensive ornamental garden, containing a diverse collection of trees. After World War II the house fell into disrepair, and was eventually demolished around 1970. The grounds are now a part of the Monks Brook Greenway, a nature trail, and many of the original trees can still be seen along the brook's bank.A History of Mansbridge 1990, book, P. Wilson Southampton water supply Under the powers of the Southampton Waterworks Amendment Act 1850 a pumping station was set up at Mansbridge to take water from the River Itchen and transfer it to a pair of reservoirs on Southampton Common.

Jonathan Dayton (October 16, 1760October 9, 1824) was an American politician from the U.S. state of New Jersey. He was the youngest person to sign the United States Constitution and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, serving as the fourth Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and later the U.S. Senate. Years ago, the area of Dayton was also known for Twin City, a skating rink located on the Newark-Elizabeth border in the area of Virginia Street. St.Thomas Aquinas RC Church is located on Ludlow St. There is one train station in Dayton, Newark Liberty International Airport, served by New Jersey Transit's Northeast Corridor Line and North Jersey Coast Line, and Amtrak's Northeast Regional and Keystone Service. The station was built in 2001 to connect NJT's commuter lines and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor services with the airport's AirTrain system. It opened four years after service was run between terminals on the AirTrain. The station is only a transfer station and not publicly accessible by any roads. http we://www.newarkha.org/cni/CNIDOCS/CNI%20TRANSFORMATION%20PLAN/Draft_Dayton_Street_TP_- _Narrative_Only_04-09-14[1].pdf Proposal to extend PATH service to the airport may include a station at Dayton.

Early life Hayward was educated at Gresham's School and in France before going up to King's College, Cambridge in 1923 to read English and modern languages. While still a Cambridge undergraduate, he edited and published the Collected Works of the Earl of Rochester. Career From 1927, Hayward lived in London, working as an editor, critic, anthologist and bibliographer. He edited many of Jonathan Swift's works. In 1929, he edited John Donne, Dean of St Paul's: Complete Poetry and Selected Prose for the Nonesuch Press. For eleven years, from 1946 to 1957, he shared a house with his close friend the poet T. S. Eliot, gathering and archiving Eliot's papers and styling himself Keeper of the Eliot Archive. Eliot's book of verse called Poems Written in Early Youth was compiled and edited by Hayward. With Eliot's help he emended the poems from The Harvard Advocate and added the poems from Eliot's days at St. Louis' Smith Academy, plus the previously unpublished \\"The Death of Saint Narcissus\\". This friendship was strained by Eliot's unexpected marriage in January 1957 to his secretary Esm√© Valerie Fletcher. To a large extent, she took over Hayward's functions in Eliot's life after they separated their households. Since the mid-1920s Hayward had suffered from muscular dystrophy, and he died in 1965, a few months after Eliot. He bequeathed his entire collection of the literary manuscripts of T.S. Eliot to King's College, Cambridge. Bibliography * Collected Works of the Earl of Rochester, ed. John Davy Hayward (1925) * John Donne, Dean of St Paul's: Complete Poetry and Selected Prose, ed.

In July 1953 West Coast scheduled flights to 32 airports in Washington, Oregon and Idaho; in May 1968 it flew to 36 airports including 29 in those states. Like other Local Service airlines West Coast was subsidized; in 1962 its \\"revenues\\" included $6.6 million from passengers and $5.4 million for \\"mail\\".Moody's Transportation Manual 1964 West Coast was the first local service airline in the U.S. to use turbine airliners when it began Fairchild F-27 flights in September 1958. The F-27 was the U.S. manufactured version of the Dutch built Fokker F27 Friendship. In June 1968 West Coast was the first airline to order Fairchild 228 twin jets with the acquisition of three planned, but the F-228, a smaller variant of the Dutch manufactured Fokker F28 Fellowship, never made it to production. The only jet operated by West Coast was the Douglas DC-9-14 with 75 seats, all coach. On July 1, 1968 West Coast merged with Pacific Air Lines and Bonanza Air Lines to form Air West, which became Hughes Airwest in 1970. In 1968 West Coast operated Douglas DC-9s, Fairchild F-27s, and Douglas DC-3s and Piper Navajos. The DC-3s were not transferred to Air West and were retired; the Navajos continued for a short time. The West Coast route system then included cities in Idaho, Oregon and Washington State and several in Montana. San Francisco, Oakland and Sacramento in northern California were added in 1959 with Salt Lake City being served later. West Coast's only international destination was Calgary, Alberta which was served with F-27s from Spokane. Almost all West Coast flights at Seattle used Boeing Field (BFI) instead of Seattle/Tacoma International Airport (SEA); after the merger Air West and successor Hughes Airwest continued to use Boeing Field until DC-9 and F-27 flights moved to SEA in 1971.One exception: in 1967 three Navajo flights a day did CLM-SEA-BFI-CLM.

West Coast's lineage runs through a string of mergers: In 1980 Hughes Airwest was acquired by Republic Airlines which had been created by a merger of Southern Airways and North Central Airlines in 1979. In 1986 Republic Airlines was acquired by Northwest Airlines (formerly Northwest Orient Airlines). The Delta-Northwest merger with Delta Air Lines as the surviving air carrier was completed in 2010. In 2001 an attempt was made to resurrect the West Coast Airlines name, with plans for an airline based in Concord, California, to connect several Northern California cities with Las Vegas, Reno and San Diego. The effort ended in bankruptcy. A Canadian commuter airline with a similar name, West Coast Air, currently operates floatplanes between Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia.

Tamzhing Lh√ºndrup Monastery () in Bumthang District in central Bhutan is a Nyingma gompa in Bhutan. Its temple and monastery are remarkable for their direct connection to the Bhutanese tert√∂n and saint, Pema Lingpa (1450-1521) and his tulkus. It is now the seat of Sungtrul Rinpoche, the current speech incarnation of Pema Lingpa. Tamzhing consists of a deteriorating temple and a cramped vihara. It supports a body of over 95 Buddhist monks. In March 2012, the monastery was submitted for inscription on the list of World Heritage Sites; it currently resides on the tentative list. History The temple was built by Pema Lingpa in 1501; the coeval wall paintings include his portrait and are amongst the earliest in the country. Before 1960 Tamshing was a privately owned temple (like many other temples in Bhutan). After Pema Lingpa died in the temple at the age of seventy-two in 1521, his descendants took over care of the temple. Gradually, over many years, Tamshing fell into a state of disrepair and neglect. The temple courtyard was used as a granary and local people came less and less, except for special days. In 1959, when many Tibetans (including the present Dalai Lama) fled their country for fear of being killed quite a few came to the Bumthang region, which is the cradle of Buddhism in Bhutan. In his time, Pema Lingpa received a vision to travel to Tibet where he revealed a treasure hidden by Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava) many centuries before. He was given land in the Longti area of the Siti valley and built a temple there which is called Lhalung. This temple was later enlarged by his third (Tibetan) incarnation. Pema Lingpa travelled frequently to Tibet and most of his incarnations were Tibetan. The 10th incarnation of Pema Lingpa died in Tibet shortly before the Tibetan diaspora. In 1960, a group of three monks from Lhalung monk body headed by Lhalung's second in command, Thinley Kuenchap (d. 1975) came to Tamshing to reestablish the Lhalung monk body at Tamshing. Lopen Thinley Kuenchap was well known to the exiled Tibetan monks in Bhutan. Hearing of his arrival at Tamshing, many gathered there in late 1960 and established the current monk body. Over time, this group has grown from 10 or 15 monks to over 95. When the Khudun, Lopen Kharma, came to Tamshing as a young boy in 1980, most of the senior monks from Tibet had passed on, however, Lopen Tseten who came from Tibet to Tamshing as a 10-year-old monk in 1960 was still there. Today, Lopen Tseten is the head of the monastery organization and its senior teacher. The present spiritual head of Tamshing is the 11th incarnation of Pema Lingpa, the Lama Sungtrul Rinpoche (speech incarnation) he was born in the Chumi Valley of Bumthang, Bhutan in 1967. Tamshing today The core missions of Tamshing are teaching the Dharma, performing religious services for the community and educating the young monks under its care. Since Tamshing is not government supported it faces increasing challenges posed by supporting 95 monks while maintaining the ancient physical structures. Mostly under the age of 15, the monks are either orphans or from very poor families who can't afford to send their children to a state school. As the economy of the country changes, and as the culture becomes more outward looking, it is inevitable that some of the old ways of supporting the temples and monasteries, (which are the repositories of traditional wisdom), are being tested. Tamshing has no endowment; no mission to make money, its only mission is to meet the needs of the community. Currently, the monastery runs at a loss. Butter lamps are lit in front of the wall paintings for devotional purposes, which causes some damage. Tamshing and Bhutanese Dance Tamshing is the original home of sacred dances that are celebrated at traditional Tsechus (festivals) throughout Bhutan. According to Joseph Houseal, director of Core of Culture Dance Preservation: \\"Dance...is the living tradition of their founding identity and the means by which Pema Lingpa sought to teach the world Buddhism - and the treasure he specifically left the Tamshing monks. It is the life of the order, the Buddhist truth they maintain. That is one reason we have focused on Tamshing: their dances were revealed by the most famous Bhutanese saint, and Tamshing alone performs the dances correctly...\\" Gallery Bumthang-Tamshing Lhakhang-04-2015-gje.jpg Bumthang-Tamshing Lhakhang-06-2015-gje.jpg Bumthang-Tamshing Lhakhang-10-Innenhof- Moenche-2015-gje.jpg Bumthang-Tamshing Lhakhang-14-Innenhof- Moenche-2015-gje.jpg References External links *Friends of Tamshing Religious buildings and structures completed in 1501 Buddhist monasteries in Bhutan Nyingma monasteries and temples Tibetan Buddhism in Bhutan 1501 establishments in Asia ","title":"Tamzhing Monastery"},{"id":"6440991","text":"Horokhiv (, , Arkhev, ) is a town in Volyn Oblast, Ukraine.

There are two broad geographic types of Myxoma virus, Californian and South American. Californian myxoma virus is found on the west coast of the USA, the Baja peninsula of Mexico, and the southwest coast of Canada. South American or Brazilian myxoma virus is found in South and Central America. South American myxoma virus circulates in the jungle rabbit or tapeti (Sylvilagus brasiliensis), whereas Californian myxoma virus circulates in the brush rabbit (Sylvilagus bachmani). In their native hosts, the viruses cause the formation of benign cutaneous fibromas rather than systemic disease. Transmission Myxoma virus is passively transmitted on the mouth parts of mosquitoes, fleas, and presumably other biting arthropods. It can also be spread through direct contact and contaminated fomites. Myxomatosis Myxomatosis is the name of the lethal disseminated disease that occurs when European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are infected with Myxoma virus. Both the South and North American types of Myxoma virus are capable of causing this disease. Californian myxoma virus is particularly virulent, causing 100% mortality.  Structure and Genome Virions are enveloped, and have a surface membrane with lateral bodies. The envelope contains host-derived lipids and self-synthesized glycolipids. They are brick-shaped and about 250 nanometers in diameter, 300 nm in length and 200 nm in height. The middle contains a biconcave core which appears to be characteristic to many poxviruses. Evolution history of Myxoma virus The genome is nonsegmented and contains a single molecule of linear double- stranded DNA, 160,000 nucleotides in length. The genome has a G-C content of ~40%, with terminally redundant sequences which are repeated at both ends. The genome encodes 170 open reading frames, twelve of which are duplicated in the terminal inverted repetitions.  Infection and pathology  During their normal life cycles, virions produce extracellular and intracellular proteins. The extracellular proteins are used primarily for suppressing or circumventing the host immune responses, hence are nonessential. Infection is also initiated by extracellular virions. Myxoma virus matures naturally by budding through the surface membrane of the host cell.ICTVdB Management (2006). 00.058.1.05.001. Myxoma virus. In: ICTVdB‚ÄîThe Universal Virus Database, version 4. B√ºchen-Osmond, C. (Ed), Columbia University, New York, USA. Myxoma virus has multiple methods that it utilizes to evade the immune system. One route of protection involves blocking the caspase activity within the host cells. The E13L viral protein is able to inhibit the caspases by binding to the CARD protein, which is part of the caspase-1-activating inflammasome complex. By binding it is able to inhibit apoptosis, which is normally induced by the CARD protein. In addition, Myxoma virus utilizes the Serp-2 viral gene to inhibit a variety of other caspases. The Serp-2 gene is also capable of inhibiting granzyme B, a cysteine protease. Myxoma virus is also capable of producing tumor necrosis factor receptor mimics to reduce the host's natural response to TNF. The M-T2 protein is a soluble receptor that mimics the TNF receptors within rabbits. Most rabbit and hare hosts are susceptible to the virus, which means the virus can effectively evade the host immunity. However, susceptibility is not the primary indicator for symptomatic infection or pathology. A distinction must be made between susceptibility and permissibility, in which only the latter must be true before the virus is able to replicate in the cell and cause pathologies. This is the reason Myxoma virus is very species-specific; it is able to circumvent a certain species of rabbit's immune response, but is unable to do so for any other species. However, the virus is able to get into the cells of many different species including human, mouse, and monkey, which is generally useless if it is unable to replicate and avoid the immune system. In 1993, the Australian government approved a modification of Myxoma virus that would introduce genetic code into rabbit sperm and egg proteins. This mutation would induce an autoimmune response and inhibit fertility. This immunocontraceptive vaccine is still being tested for wild release. Research The myxoma virus has become of interest in human medicine in the last two decades. Some of its proteins have strong immunosuppressive effects, and several of its virus-encoded immunomodulators are being developed to treat systemic inflammatory syndromes in people such as cardiovascular disease. The myxoma virus also has the ability to infect many types of human cancer cells, which is being used to develop it as a virotherapeutic agent.

The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FASO), which managed the institutions of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 2013‚Äî2018, would now become part of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education. The corresponding executive order was signed by the President Vladimir Putin. After splitting, the Russian abbreviation Minobrnauki of Russia previously implied the parent ministry, is henceforth officially used with respect to the child Ministry of Science and Higher Education.

The engine was used in the Austin Montego, Mark 1 Rover 200-series and the MG Maestro. The engine was used in the Austin Maestro from 1985 onwards. Description The engine comes from the same lineage as the BMC- developed E-series family introduced in the 1969 Austin Maxi, but with important modifications in order to facilitate compatibility with a conventional \\"end-on\\" transmission unit, in place of BMC/BL's traditional \\"gearbox-in-sump\\" configuration for its front wheel drive vehicles. The gearbox flange was redesigned to accept either a Volkswagen manual gearbox (for the Maestro/Montego), or the PG-1 transmission (for the Rover 200). The S-Series was produced in a single capacity of 1.6 litres (1,598cc) as the smaller and larger capacity requirements were already served by the 1.3-litre A-series/Honda EV engines and the 2.0-litre O-series engines respectively. Fuelling was by means of a single carburettor in most applications, and electronic fuel injection for the higher-specification variants of the Rover 216 producing peak power of . BL had also developed the earlier R-series engine from the E-series family, but largely as a stopgap at the Maestro's launch since the S series was not yet ready for production. Because the E series had to be turned through 180 degrees in order to facilitate an end-on transmission, the resultant R-series unit had the inlet manifold on the front- facing side of the cylinder head, something which proved fatal for the engine's reliability--since it opened the door for carburettor icing. The S series solved this problem, as the inlet manifold was now on the rear face of the engine. Another important advance over the E/R series was the adoption of a camshaft driven by a toothed belt in place of the previous timing chain system. History Production of the S-series engine continued until the end of Montego / Maestro series production in 1993, the remaining cars which were built by Rover until 1994 used only the O-series diesel engine. A 4-valve version of the S series was under development alongside the 1100 cc and 1400 cc K-series engines. However, the project was abandoned when a redesign of the K series allowed its capacity to be stretched to 1600 cc and 1800 cc. The engine was given the name L16 but should not be confused with the L Series diesel engines or Datsun/Nissan L16 engine.

The square is an important economic, cultural, and transport center of the Podil, containing numerous architectural and historical monuments. History Main entrance to the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. Contract Square is known since the Kyivan Rus' times as an important part of the Podil merchant neighborhood. The square lies in between the Andriyivskyy Descent, Sahaidachny, Pokrivska, Florivska, Prytisko-Mykilska, Kostiantynivska, Mezhyhirska, Spaska, Skovorody and Ilynska streets. The construction of the Contracts House, a permanent trading center where contracts were signed, at the end of the 18th century gave the square its current name. During 1748-1749, the Fountain of Samson was built to repair the water distribution system of the area (Out of print) to a design by Ukrainian architect Ivan Hryhorovych-Barskyi. The compound of the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, one of Ukraine's leading universities dating back to 16th century, adjoins the square. In the 1970s, archaeological works conducted by the Institute of Archaeology of the Ukrainian SSR were done on the square, as well as reconstructions of the square's main constructions. The square was renamed several times during its history: in 1869-1919 the square was named Alexander Square in honour of the Russian emperor Alexander II; in 1919-1944 it was named Red Square, dedicated to Communism; between 1945 and the 1950s, it was renamed back to Contracts, although Red continued to be widely used among elder people; in 1990, the original name was re-established.

It is not known exactly when the first humans arrived in what is now Kentucky. Around 1800 BCE, a gradual transition began from a hunter-gatherer economy to agriculturalism. Around 900 CE, a Mississippian culture took root in western and central Kentucky; by contrast, a Fort Ancient culture appeared in eastern Kentucky. While the two had many similarities, the distinctive ceremonial earthwork mounds constructed in the former's centers were not part of the culture of the latter. The first permanent European-American settlement, Harrod's Town, was established in 1774. Kentucky was the 15th U.S. state, admitted to the Union on June 1, 1792, after the American Revolutionary War. Kentucky was initially neutral in the American Civil War, but joined the Union side after a Confederate invasion in 1861. The state remained under Union control for most of the war. Daniel Boone Escorting Settlers through the Cumberland Gap (George Caleb Bingham, oil on canvas, 1851‚Äì52)  Pre-European habitation and culture  Paleo-Indian era (9500 BCE ‚Äì 7500 BCE) Based on evidence in other regions, humans were likely living in Kentucky prior to 10,000 BCE, but \\"archaeological evidence of their occupation has yet to be documented\\". Stone tools, particularly projectile points (arrowheads) and scrapers, are the primary evidence of the earliest human activity in the Americas. Paleo-indian bands probably moved their camps many times a year. Their camps were typically small ones, consisting of 20‚Äì50 people. Band organization was egalitarian, so there were no formal leaders and no social ranking or classes. Scientific evidence links indigenous Americans as descendants of Asian peoples, specifically eastern Siberian populations. Indigenous peoples of the Americas have been linked to Siberian populations by linguistic factors, the distribution of blood types, and in genetic composition as reflected by molecular data, such as DNA. At the end of the last Ice Age, between 8000‚Äì7000 BCE Kentucky's climate stabilized, leading to a rise in population and technology advances that resulted in more sedentary lifestyle. This warming trend killed the Pleistocene big game megafauna, such as the mammoth, mastodon, giant beavers, tapirs, short faced bear, giant ground sloths, saber-toothed tiger, horse, bison, musk ox, stag-moose, and peccary. All of these were native to Kentucky during the Ice Age, and became extinct or moved north as the glacial ice retreated. No skeletal remains of Paleoindians have been discovered in Kentucky, and while many Paleoindian Clovis points have been discovered, there's scant evidence that the Paleoindians at Big Bone Lick State Park in Kentucky hunted mastodons. Archaic era (7500 BCE ‚Äì 1000 BCE) By 7500 BCE, a catastrophic extinction of large game animals at the end of the Ice Age changed the culture of this area. By 4000 BCE, Kentucky peoples exploited native wetland resources. Large shell middens (trash piles, ancient landfills) are evidence of their consumption of clams and mussels. They left middens along rivers, but there is limited evidence of Archaic peoples occupying areas along coastlines prior to 3000 BCE. Archaic Kentucky natives' social groups were small, consisting of a few cooperating families. The large shell middens, artifact caches, human and dog burials, and burnt-clay flooring prove Archaic natives lived in permanent locations. The white-tailed deer, mussels, fish, oysters, turtles, and the elk were the dominant game animals of Archaic natives. They developed the atlatl, which made it easier to chuck spears with greater velocity. Other tools Archaic natives used were grooved axes, conical and cylindrical pestles, bone awls, cannel coal beads, hammerstones, and bannerstones. Hominy holes were used too. Hominy holes were a depression worn in sandstone by a person grinding or pulverizing. They were used by women who ground hickory nuts or seed to make them easier to use for food. The people buried their dogs within shell (mussel) mound sites along the Green and Cumberland rivers. At Kentucky's Indian Knoll site, 67,000 artifacts were uncovered, including 4,000 projectile points, and twenty-three dog burials, seventeen of which were well preserved. Some dogs were buried alone, others with their masters; some with adults, male and female, and others with children. Archaic dogs were medium- sized and stood about tall at the shoulder. They are very likely to have been related to the wolf. Dogs had a special place in the lives of Archaic and historic indigenous peoples. The Cherokee believed that dogs are spiritual, moral, and sacred. The Yuchi are a tribe known to have lived around the Green River and they may have shared these beliefs. The Indian Knoll site, located along the Green River in Ohio County, Kentucky, is older than 5,000 years. While there is evidence of earlier settlement, this area was most densely occupied from approximately 3000‚Äì2000 BCE, when the climate and vegetation were nearing modern conditions. The Green River floodplain provided a stable environment, which eventually supported the people's agricultural development early in the late Holocene era. The abundant food resources and nearby mussel bed made it ideal for Kentucky natives to permanently settle. At the end of the Archaic period, they had cultivated a form of squash, which were used both for their edible seeds and dried and preserved as containers (gourds). Woodland era (1000 BCE ‚Äì 900 CE) About 1800 BCE, Kentucky's native Americans had started to cultivate several species of wild plants, transitioning from a hunter-gatherer economy to an agricultural-based economy. The Woodland era represents the \\"middle\\" era between the mostly hunter- gatherers of the Archaic era and the agriculturalist Mississippian culture era. The Woodland era is a developmental stage without any massive changes, but is constituted by a continuous development in shelter construction, stone and bone tools, textile manufacture, leather crafting, and agricultural cultivation. Archeologists have identified distinctly separate cultures during the Middle Woodland period. Examples include the Armstrong culture, Copena culture, Crab Orchard culture, Fourche Maline culture, the Goodall Focus, the Havana Hopewell culture, the Kansas City Hopewell, the Marksville culture, and the Swift Creek culture. The remains of two distinct Woodland groups, the Adena (early Woodland) and the Hopewell (middle Woodland), have been found in present-day Louisville, and in the central Bluegrass and northeastern Kentucky areas. Some Woodland tribes were able to get copper from Lake Superior, conch shells from the Gulf of Mexico, and obsidian from the Rocky Mountains. The introduction of pottery, its widespread use, and the increased sophistication of its forms and decoration, first believed to have occurred around 1,000 BCE, is a major demarcation of the Woodland era. Archaic pots were thick, heavy, and fragile, but Woodland pottery pots were more intricately designed, and had more uses, such as for cooking and storing surplus food. Woodland peoples also used baskets and gourds for containers. Around 200BCE, maize production migrated to the eastern United States from Mexico. The introduction of corn is when Kentucky natives slowly changed from growing indigenous plants to a maize based agricultural economy. In addition to cultivating corn, the Woodland people also cultivated giant ragweeds, amaranth (pigweed), and maygrass. The initial four plants known to have been domesticated were goosefoot (Chenopodium berlandieri), sunflower (Helianthus annuus var. macroscarpus), marshelder (Iva annua var. macrocarpa), and squash (Cucurbita pepo ssp. ovifera) (gourds). Woodland people raised tobacco in their gardens, which they used for smoking, especially for rital purposes. Woodland people still used ground stone tools, especially for processing nuts and seeds. They mined both Mammoth Cave and Salts Cave for gypsum and mirabilite, a salty seasoning. Shellfish was still an important part of their diets, and the most common prey was white-tailed deer. They continued to make and use spears, but late in the Woodland era, the straight bow became the typical weapon of choice in the eastern United States. This is shown by the reduction in size of arrowheads during this period. In addition to bows and arrows, some southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns. Between 450 BCE and 100 BCE, the native Americans in Kentucky begin to build earthwork burial mounds, which indicates social change. The Woodland Indians buried their dead in conical, and then later flat, or oval-shaped, burial mounds, which were often high (like Serpent Mound). This practice resulted in the Woodland people being called the Mound Builders by 19th-century observers. The increasing use of agriculture during the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex meant that Kentucky natives' shifted from nomadic culture to living in permanently occupied villages. They then lived in bigger houses and larger communities, although intensive agriculture did not begin until the Mississippian era. Mississippian era (900 CE ‚Äì 1750 CE) Annis Mound and Village, a Mississippian period site in Butler County Around 900 CE maize became highly productive and the Eastern Agricultural Complex was replaced by the maize- based agriculture of the Mississippian culture era. The Mississippian era natives' village life revolved around planting, growing, and harvesting maize and beans, which made up 60% of their diet. Stone and bone hoes were used by the women for most of the cultivation work. They produced the \\"Three Sisters\\" (maize, beans, and squash), which were interplanted to take advantage of each plant's characteristics. Beans could climb the corn stalks, and the large squash leaves would shelter the earth and reduce weeds. White-tailed deer was the dominant game animal that was hunted. Mississippian culture pottery was more varied and elaborate than that of the Woodland period, including painting and decorations, and a range of vessel forms such a bottles, plates, pans, jars, pipes, funnels, bowls, and colanders. Potters added handles to jars, and they attached human and animal effigies to some bowls and bottles. The elite of the ancient Mississippians lived in rectangular houses, substantially built, on top of large platform mounds. Excavations of their houses found burned clay wall fragments (daub), which demonstrate they decorated their walls with murals. They lived year-round in large communities, some of which had defensive palisades to protect their settlements, and had been established for centuries. An average Fort Ancient or Mississippian town had about 2,000 people living in it. Some people lived in smaller farms and hamlets. Larger towns, centered on mounds and plazas, served as ceremonial and administrative centers. They were located near the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys and their tributaries: rivers with large floodplains. These were sites of farmland, transportation routes by river, and backwater plants and animals. There are many Mississippian town sites in western Kentucky, such as the Adams, Backusburg, Canton, Chambers, Jonathan Creek, McLeod's Bluff, Rowlandtown, Sassafras Ridge, Turk, Twin Mounds, and Wickliffe sites. The Wickliffe Mounds in far western Kentucky were inhabited from 1000-1350 CE. There were two large platform mounds and eight smaller mounds scattered around a central plaza. They traded with North Carolina, Wisconsin, and the Gulf of Mexico societies. The community of Wickliffe had a social hierarchy ruled by a hereditary chief. The Rowlandton Mound Site was inhabited from 1100 to 1350 CE. The Rowlandton Mound site occupied a site, and also a large platform mound and an associated village area, similar to the Wickliffe Mounds Site. It is probable that these civic sites were established originally by local Late Woodland peoples. The Tolu Site was inhabited by Kentucky natives from 1200‚Äì1450 CE. The Tolu site originally had three mounds: a burial mound, a substructure platform mound, and one other of undetermined function. It also had a central plaza, and a large, -deep midden area. A rare Cahokia-made Missouri flint clay human effigy pipe was found as this site. The Marshall Site was inhabited from 900 to 1300 CE; the Turk Site from 1100 ‚Äì 1500 CE; and the Adams Site from 1100 to 1500 CE. The Slack Farm was populated from 1400-1650 CE. This had a mound, and extensive village occupation. As many as a thousand or more people could have been buried at the seven cemeteries at the site. Some were buried in stone box graves. Native Americans abandoned a large late Mississippian village in Petersburg that contained at least two periods of habitation dating to 1150 CE and 1400 CE\\" French explorers in the 17th century documented numerous tribes living in Kentucky until the Beaver Wars in the 1670s. The late Mississippian period overlapped with the tribes of the historic period who were encountered by the French, Spanish, and English colonists. Native groups known to have lived in Kentucky include, but are not limited to: Cherokee (in southeastern Kentucky caves, and along the Cumberland River); Chickasaw (in the western Jackson Purchase area, especially along the Tennessee River); Delaware (Lenape), Mosopelea (at the mouth of the Cumberland River); Shawnee (all throughout the Bluegrass State); Wyandot, and the Yuchi (on the Green River). Hunting bands of Iroquois, Illinois, Lenape, and Miami also visited Kentucky. First Europeans in Kentucky Rene-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle, 1669?, 1673 According to The Jesuit Relations, from about 1662‚Äì1672 the Shawnee were driven from their Cumberland Valley home by the Iroquois Five Nations in the Beaver Wars. Some Shawnee fled to South Carolina, but more migrated westward to Illinois. Rene-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle was a French explorer who claimed all of the land along the Mississippi River Valley, including Kentucky, for France. In July 1669, Robert de la Salle organized twenty four men and six canoes for his expedition. During this venture, he met Louis Joliet and Jacques Marquette, the first white men to explore and map the Mississippi River, in Hamilton, Ontario. The expedition eventually reached the Ohio River, allegedly, which it followed as far as Louisville, Kentucky. In 1673 (1679?), La Salle traveled down the Mississippi River, passing by present-day Kentucky after reaching the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, on his second expedition. Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet, 1673 In the fall of 1673, Jacques Marquette, a French Jesuit missionary, and Louis Jolliet, a French Canadian explorer, passed a small piece of Kentucky by the mouth of the Ohio on their boat trip down the Mississippi River. Later, their boat capsized, and many of their papers were destroyed. Gabriel Arthur, 1673 English colonists Gabriel Arthur and James Needham were sent out by Abraham Wood from Fort Henry (present Petersburg, Virginia) on May 17, 1673 with four horses and some Cherokee and other Native American slaves to make direct contact with the Tomahittan (possibly Yuchi.) They were traveling to the capital in Chota (present-day Tennessee) on the Hiwassee River in order to learn their language. The English hoped to develop strong business ties for the beaver fur trade, and to bypass the Occaneechi traders who were serving as middlemen on the Trading Path. On his return journey, Needham got into an argument with \\"Indian John\\", his Occaneechi guide, that became an armed confrontation resulting in his death: \\"Indian John\\" tried to get the Tomahittan to kill Arthur but the chief prevented this by adopting the Englishman. For about a year, Arthur, dressed as the Tomahittan of Chota, traveled with the chief and his war parties on revenge raids of Spanish settlements in Florida (after ten men had been killed, and ten captured during a peaceful trading mission several years before). They also visited Indian communities on the east coast, and returned north to raid Shawnee towns on the Ohio River in the winter of 1673/1674. When the Tomahittan tribe attacked the Shawnee in the Ohio River valley, Arthur was wounded by an arrow and captured. He was saved from ritual burning at the stake by a Shawnee who was sympathetic to him. Upon learning that Arthur had married a Tomahittan woman (\\"Hannah Rebecca\\" Nikitie), the Shawnee cured his wound, gave him his gun, gave him rokahamoney (hominy) to eat, and put him on a trail that led back to his family at Chota. Most historians agree this road was the Warriors' Path that crossed the Ohio at the mouth of the Scioto River, went south across the Red River branch of the Kentucky River, then up Station Camp Creek and through Ouasiota Pass into the Ouasiota Mountains. In June 1674 (1678?), the Tomahittan chief escorted Arthur back to his English settlement in Virginia. Arthur's accounts of the land and the tribes who inhabited it provided the first detailed information about Kentucky. Arthur was also among the first Englishmen (preceded by Batts and Fallam) to visit modern West Virginia, and cross the Cumberland Gap. Arnout Viele, 1693 In early autumn 1692, Arnout Viele, a loyal English-speaking Dutchman, and a party of eleven companions‚ÄîEuropeans, Shawnee, and a few loyal Delaware guides‚Äîfrom Esopus were sent out by the Governor of New York in order to establish trade relationships with the Shawnee to bring them into the English sphere of influence. Viele understood several Native American languages, which made him valuable as an interpreter. He is credited with being the first white man to travel and explore western Pennsylvania and the Upper Ohio Valley. Viele made contact with nations located as far west as the Wabash River border, in present-day Indiana. Viele and company left Albany, traveling southbound, crossing portions of present-day New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. They apparently followed the West Branch of the Susquehanna River into the mountains, going through the Tioga River, and reaching a tributary of the Allegheny River. They floated down to the Shawnee towns along the Ohio River. Viele and his pioneer expedition spent most of 1693 exploring the Ohio River and its tributaries in northern Kentucky with their Shawnee hosts. In February 1694, Gerit Luykasse, two of Viele's Dutch traders, and two Shawnee reappeared at Albany on a mission \\"to fetch powder for Arnout [Viele] and his Company.\\" Their party had been gone fifteen months, but Arnout was gone for about 2 years. In August 1694, Viele and his companions returned from the Pennsylvania wilderness, accompanied by hundreds of Shawnee who intended to relocate in the Minisink country on the upper Delaware River and by the diplomats of \\"seven Nations of Indians\\". These were seeking either trade with the English or peace with the powerful Iroquois nations of New York and Pennsylvania. Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de L√©ry, 1729 In 1729, Gaspard- Joseph Chaussegros de L√©ry, a French architect and surveyor whose survey was the first reconnaissance charting of the Ohio River, led an expedition of French troops from Fort Niagara down the Allegheny and Ohio rivers, as far as the mouth of the Big Miami by Big Bone Lick, and possibly to the Falls of the Ohio (where present-day Louisville is located). Chaussegros de Lery mapped the Great Lakes in 1725, and he was the engineer of the Niagara fortifications in 1726. Located inside Charlevoix's History of New France is the map of the Ohio River valley drawn by Bellin, developed from observations made by de Lery. The 1744 Bellin map, named \\"Map of Louisiana\\" (), contains an inscription at a point south of the Ohio River and north of the \\"Falls,\\" written: \\"Place where one found the ivory of Elephant in 1729 (). De Lery's men found teeth that weighed , with a diameter of , tusks that measured in length, in diameter, and thigh bones that were long. These bones were collected and shipped to Paris, where they were identified as mastodon remains. Today they are on display at the National Natural History Museum in Paris. Charles Le Moyne III, Baron de Longueil, 1739 Charles III Le Moyne, second Baron de Longueuil, later the Governor of Montreal and Interim Governor of New France, who had commanded Fort Niagara from 1726‚Äì1733, led an expedition of 442 men, including Native Americans, from Montreal to war against the Chickasaw who occupied territory on the lower part of the Mississippi River, in the area claimed as La Louisiane. According to Gaston Pierre de L√©vis, Duke de Mirepoix, this expedition used the Ohio River as a corridor to the Mississippi River. The 1739 expedition of Charles Le Moyne III consisted of the following: One of the first reported eyewitness accounts of Shannoah, a Shawnee town, was by Charles Le Moyne III in July 1739. While on their journey down the Ohio River toward the Mississippi, they met with local chiefs in a village on the banks of the Scioto. John Howard and John Peter Salling, 1742 John Howard, a pioneer from Virginia, led a party of five‚ÄîJohn Peter Salling (a Pennsylvania German), Josiah Howard (John's son), Charles Sinclair, and John Poteet (Vizt)‚Äîfrom the mountains in Virginia to the Mississippi River. The elder Howard had a promised reward of of land for a successful expedition from Virginia's Royal Governor's Council to reinforce British claims in the west. Howard offered equal shares of the to the four other members of his expedition. On March 16, 1742, the party of five started at John Peter Salling's house in August County, and voyaged westwards to Cedar Creek, near the Natural Bridge. Crossing Greenbrier River, and landing at the New River. At New River, the Virginian explorers constructed a large bullboat frame and then covered it with the skin of five buffaloes they killed. The first Englishmen to explore that region then followed the New River over until the river became too dangerous to navigate, abandoning it at a major falls, traveling overland to the Coal River, then followed the Kanawha River, where they entered the Ohio River, above the \\"Great Falls\\" of present-day Louisville. The five Virginian pioneers traced the northern boundary of Kentucky for and finally reached the Mississippi River on June 7. The Virginians were able to descend to just below the mouth of the Arkansas River, where, on July 2, 1742, they were ambushed by a large company of native Americans, Blacks, and Frenchmen. One or two of Howard's men were killed. The rest were carried them off New Orleans where they were imprisoned as spies. After two years of prison, Salling escaped on October 25, 1744, eventually returning by a southern route to his home in Augusta County, Virginia, in May 1745. John Howard's fate was different than Salling's. After he was arrested and imprisoned, Howard was extradited to France to stand trial. His ship was intercepted by the English, and as a free man, he reported his adventures after landing in London, but his account has not survived. Salling's detailed account of Virginia's adjacent lands was used by Joshua Fry and Peter Jefferson's 1751 map. Salling is credited with being the first person to have discovered coal in the United States when he was on the aptly named Coal River. Pierre Joseph C√©loron de Blainville, 1749 Comte de la Galissoniere, the governor of Canada, ordered Pierre Joseph C√©loron de Blainville to strengthen the French claim on the Ohio Valley. C√©loron carried out his \\"lead plate expedition\\" in the summer of 1749. C√©loron set out from Montreal on June 15, 1749, in a flotilla consisting of large boats and canoes. The expedition included 216 French and Canadians and 55 Native Americans. In Shannoah at the Scioto River's mouth, he again encountered English traders. C√©loron demanded that the English leave, but most refused. Origin of the name The origin of the name \\"Kentucky\\" is not known with any certainty. One suggestion is that it is derived from an Iroquois name meaning \\"land of tomorrow\\". Native America: A State-by-State Historical Encyclopedia states that \\"Various authors have offered a number of opinions concerning the word's meaning: the Iroquois word \\"kentake\\" meaning \\"meadow land,\\" the Wyandotte (or perhaps Cherokee or Iroquois) word \\"ken-tah-the\\" meaning \\"land of tomorrow,\\" the Algonquian term \\"kin-athiki\\" referring to a river bottom, a Shawnee word meaning \\"at the head of a river,\\" or an Indian word meaning land of \\"cane and turkeys.\\" However, the name does not mean \\"dark and bloody ground\\" in any language.\\" There were many variations of the word during early pioneer times, including Kentucke (as in The Discovery, Settlement and Present State of Kentucke), Kaintuckee and Cantuckey. The state's official nickname is the \\"Bluegrass State,\\" which is derived from the famed species of grass grown in central Kentucky, Bluegrass, or Poa. \\"The nickname also recognizes the role that the Bluegrass region has played in Kentucky's economy and history.\\" Early period of European settlement Pre-Conquest Native American settlements =Eskippakithiki= Eskippakithiki, aka Indian Old Fields, was Kentucky's last surviving Shawnee village. It was located in present-day Clark County. A 1736 French census numbers Eskippakithiki's population at two hundred families. Blackhoof was born here. John Findley/Finley, the man who showed Kentucky flatlands to Daniel Boone in 1769, piquing Boone's interest in Kentucky, showed him the flatlands where Eskippakithiki used to be established. John Findley/Finley lived and traded in Eskippakithiki in 1752. John Findley/Finley claims that he was attacked by a party of 50 Christian Conewago and Ottawa Indians, a white French Canadian, and a white renegade Dutchman named Philip Philips, all from the St. Lawrence River, upon a scalping hunting expedition against the southern Indians, on January 28, 1753, along the Warrior's Path, south of Eskippakithiki, near the head of Station Camp Creek in Estill County. Major William Trent wrote the letter that first mentions the word \\"Kentucky\\" regarding the attack on John Findley. Major Trent wrote: The seven Pennsylvanian white traders with John Findley/Finley's crew consisted of James Lowry, David Hendricks, Alexander McGinty, Jabez Evans, Jacob Evans, William Powell, Thomas Hyde, and their Cherokee slave. The white Pennsylvania traders shot at the 50 Christian Indians, and the 50 Christian Indians (along with Philip Philips), took the whites prisoner, and transported them to Canada, and shipped some of them off to France, as prisoners of war. Findley fled, and the next time a white person went to Eskippathiki, the whole town was burnt down to the ground. =Shannoah= Shannoah, aka Lower Shawneetown, aka Chalahgawtha (meaning \\"principal place\\"), is the Shawnee village where Mary Draper Ingles was taken when she was kidnapped on July 30, 1755. Ingles was the first white woman to see Kentucky. She eventually escaped. Shanoah is located in Greenup County. Established in the mid-1730s at the mouth of the Scioto River as a center for commerce and diplomacy, this was one of the earliest known Shawnee settlements on both sides of the Ohio River. Although mainly a Shawnee village, the population included contingents of Seneca and Lenape. The town became a key center in dealings with other tribes and with Europeans, notably the French and the British, before it was abandoned about November 1758, perhaps because of a 1753 flood, or the French and Indian War, which began in 1755 in the Ohio valley. Establishment of Harrod's Town Before 1750, Kentucky was populated nearly exclusively by Cherokee, Chickasaw, Shawnee, Yuchi, Mosopelea, and several other tribes of Native Americans. Early British exploration of the area that would become Kentucky was made in 1750 by a scouting party led by Dr. Thomas Walker, and in 1751 by Christopher Gist for the Ohio Company. Any French claims to Kentucky were lost after the British defeated them in the French and Indian War and signed the Treaty of Paris (1763) on February 10, 1763. The Iroquois claim to much of what is now Kentucky was purchased by the British in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix on November 5, 1768. By 1774 only a few bands of Indians were permanently resident south of the Ohio River. The major tribes‚Äîbased north of the river‚Äîagreed not to hunt south of it.Lowell H. Harrison and James C. Klotter, A New History of Kentucky (1997) pp 19-20Stephen Aron, How the West Was Lost: The Transformation of Kentucky From Daniel Boone to Henry Clay (1999), pp 17-20. In 1774, Harrod's Town became the first white permanent settlement in Kentucky. Harrod's Town, named after James Harrod, was founded by the order of the British royal Governor of Virginia John Murray, the 4th Earl of Dunmore. James Harrod led an expedition to survey the bounds of land promised by the British crown to soldiers who served in the French and Indian War. Leaving from Fort Redstone, Harrod and 37 men traveled down the Monongahela and Ohio Rivers to the mouth of the Kentucky River, eventually crossing Salt River into what is today Mercer County, Kentucky. On June 16, 1774, the men established the first pioneer settlement in Kentucky, Harrod's Town. The men divided the land amongst them; Harrod chose an area about from the settlement proper, which he named Boiling Springs. On July 8, 1774, Shawnee attacked a small party of Harrod's in the Fontainbleau area, killing two men. The others escaped to the camp, some away. Just as Harrod's men had completed the settlement's first structures, Dunmore dispatched Daniel Boone to call them back from the frontier and into military service against some bands of Shawnee and Mingo in Lord Dunmore's War. Harrod enlisted in the militia, but arrived too late to participate in the war's only major battle ‚Äì the Battle of Point Pleasant. His men arrived at the battle site at midnight on October 10, the day the fighting ended. The Treaty of Camp Charlotte, signed by Shawnee Chief Cornstalk, which concluded Lord Dunmore's War, ceded to Royal Virginia the Shawnee claims to all lands south of the Ohio River (today's states of Kentucky and West Virginia). The Shawnee were also obligated in the Treaty of Camp Charlotte to return all white captives and stop attacking barges of immigrants traveling on the Ohio River. On March 8, 1775, Harrod led a group of settlers back to Harrodstown to stay. James Pierce Barton Kentucky Landscape The defeat of the Shawnee in Lord Dunmore's War in 1774 emboldened land speculators in North Carolina, who believed much of what is now Kentucky and Tennessee would soon be under British control. One such speculator, Richard Henderson (1734‚Äì1785), learned from his friend Daniel Boone that the Cherokee were interested in selling a large part of their land on the Trans- Appalachian frontier, and Henderson quickly set up negotiations with Cherokee leaders. Between March 14 and 17, 1775, Henderson, Boone, and several associates met at Sycamore Shoals with Cherokee leaders Attakullakulla, Oconastota, Willanawaw, Doublehead and Dragging Canoe. The Treaty of Sycamore Shoals, the \\"Transylvania Purchase\\", was not recognized by Dragging Canoe who sought unsuccessfully to reject Henderson's purchase of tribal lands outside the Donelson line, and departed the conference vowing to turn the lands \\"dark and bloody\\" if settlers attempted to settle upon them. The rest of the negotiations went fairly smoothly, however, and the Treaty of Sycamore Shoals was signed on March 17, 1775. At the same conference, the Watauga and Nolichucky settlers negotiated similar purchases for their lands. Kentucky in the American Revolution (1775‚Äì1783) Map of Kentucky published in 1784 along with The Discovery, Settlement and Present State of Kentucke by John Filson After 1775, Kentucky grew rapidly as the first settlements west of the Appalachian Mountains were founded, with settlers migrating primarily from Virginia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania; they entered the region via the Cumberland Gap and the Ohio River. It was claimed by Virginia as part of its territory. The most famous of these early explorers and settlers was Daniel Boone, one of the founders of the state. During this period, the settlers introduced commodity agriculture to the area. Tobacco, corn, and hemp were developed as the major commodity crops of Kentucky, and the hunting stage of frontier life faded away. Due to the ongoing violence, however, as Native Americans resisted white settlement, by 1776 there were fewer than 200 settlers in Kentucky. During the American Revolution, 1775‚Äì1783, settlers soon began pouring into the region; Dragging Canoe responded by leading his faction into the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars, 1776‚Äì1794, especially along the Holston River, at the height of the American Revolutionary War. The Shawnee north of the Ohio River were also unhappy about the American settlement of Kentucky. Although some bands tried to be neutral, Historian Colin Calloway reports that most Shawnees fought allied with the British against the Americans. Kentucky's second largest city, and former capital Lexington, is named for Lexington, Massachusetts, site of one of the first battles of the Revolution. As the first \\"new\\" west for the Patriots, Kentucky was situated in the Western theater of the American Revolutionary War. Bryan's Station is the fort built there during the last year of the war for defense against the British and their Native American allies. Kentucky was a battleground during the war. The Battle of Blue Licks, one of the last major battles of the Revolution, was fought there; the Americans were defeated. =Establishment of Kentucky County (and its Militia officers)= After Kentucky County was legislatively created on December 6, 1776 (effective 1777), the county militia was organized as follows: :*George Rogers Clark ‚Äì Brig General Northwestern Frontier 01/1781 :*John Bowman ‚Äì Colonel ‚Äì County Lieutenant of Kentucky County, Virginia 12/1776 & 11/1779 :*Anthony Bledsoe ‚Äì Lieutenant Colonel :*John Todd ‚Äì Captain ‚Äì Virginia :*Benjamin Logan ‚Äì Captain ‚Äì Kentucky County, Virginia :*Daniel Boone ‚Äì Captain ‚Äì Boonesborough, Kentucky :*James Harrod ‚Äì Captain ‚Äì Harrodsburg, Kentucky :*David Robinson ‚Äì appointed County Lieutenant but office was never filled. In November 1780, Virginia divided Kentucky County into three: Fayette, Jefferson, and Lincoln counties. Militia officers of these counties included: :;Fayette County ::John Todd ‚Äì county lieutenant and colonel (killed at Blue Licks in 1782) ::Daniel Boone ‚Äì lieutenant colonel :;Jefferson County ::John Floyd ‚Äì county lieutenant and colonel (killed 1783) :;Lincoln County ::Benjamin Logan ‚Äì county lieutenant and colonel ::Stephen Trigg ‚Äì lieutenant colonel (killed at Blue Licks in 1782) In January 1781, Governor Thomas Jefferson appointed George Rogers Clark as brigadier general, a special position created for an expedition against British and Native Americans at Detroit, but this never materialized, because of lack of money and soldiers. As a general, Clark was the highest-ranking militia officer in Kentucky and supervised the work of the three Kentucky County colonels. =Treaty of Hopewell= Low's Map of Kentucky and neighboring Territories did not yet include the westernmost part of Kentucky, or West Tennessee, controlled by the Chickasaw Nation until 1818. From Low's Encyclopaedia The westernmost part of Kentucky, west of the Tennessee River, was recognized as hunting grounds belonging to the Chickasaw by the 1786 Treaty of Hopewell, and remained so until they sold it to the U.S. in 1818, albeit under pressure. This region is still sometimes known as the Jackson Purchase in reference to President Andrew Jackson of the period. 1792 ‚Äì Admission to the Union Several factors contributed to the desire of the residents of Kentucky to separate from Virginia. First, traveling to the Virginia state capital from Kentucky was long and dangerous. Second, offensive use of local militia against Indian raids required authorization from the governor of Virginia. Last, Virginia refused to recognize the importance of trade along the Mississippi River to Kentucky's economy. It forbade trade with the Spanish colony of New Orleans, which controlled the mouth of the Mississippi, but the trade was important to Kentucky communities. The magnitude of the problems increased with the rapid growth of population in Kentucky, leading Colonel Benjamin Logan to call a constitutional convention in Danville in 1784. Over the next several years, nine more conventions were held. During one, General James Wilkinson proposed secession from both Virginia and the United States to become a ward of Spain, but the idea was defeated. In 1788, Virginia granted its consent to Kentucky's statehood in the form of two enabling acts. The second and operative act required the Confederation Congress to admit Kentucky into the Union by July 4, 1788. A Committee of the Whole reported for Kentucky to be admitted, and on July 3, the full Congress took up the question of Kentucky statehood. Unfortunately, one day earlier, Congress had learned of New Hampshire's all-important ninth ratification of the proposed Constitution, thus establishing it as the new framework of governance for the United States. In light of that development, Congress thought that it would be \\"unadvisable\\" to admit Kentucky into the Union as it could do so \\"under the Articles of Confederation\\" but not \\"under the Constitution.\\" Therefore, it resolved Kentucky's final push for statehood, now under the US Constitution, officially began with a convention, again held at Danville, in April 1792. There delegates drafted the first Kentucky Constitution and submitted it to the Congress. On June 1, 1792, Kentucky was admitted into the Union as the fifteenth state. Antebellum period (1792‚Äì1860) Economy Land speculation was an important source of income as the first settlers sold out their claims for cash to newcomers and moved further west. The great majority of Kentuckians were farmers. They grew most of their own food, using the corn crop to feed hogs and to distill into whiskey. They obtained their cash from sales of burley tobacco, hemp, horses and mules. The hemp was spun and woven for cotton bale bagging and ropes. Tobacco was labor-intensive to cultivate; planters were attracted to Kentucky from Maryland and Virginia, where their own lands were near exhaustion from tobacco cultivation. Tobacco was a labor- intensive crop, and plantations in the Bluegrass region used slave labor, but on a smaller scale than the cotton plantations of the Deep South. Adequate transportation routes proved crucial to Kentucky's economic success in the early antebellum period. The rapid growth of stagecoach roads, canals and railroads early in the century drew many Easterners to the state. For example, towns along the Maysville Road from Washington to Lexington grew rapidly to accommodate the demand. Surveyors and cartographers had always made their fortunes in early Kentucky and especially by the antebellum period, such as David H. Burr (1803‚Äì1875), who served as geographer to the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1830s and '40s. Kentuckians loved horses, using them for transportation, mode of power, breeding, and racing. Taxpayers owned 90,000 horses in 1800, with 87% of all householders owning at least one, and two-thirds of the taxpayers owning two or more. Breeding thoroughbreds for racing is a Bluegrass specialty. Louisville began sponsoring the world-famous Kentucky Derby at the Churchill Downs track in 1875. Mules were cheaper to own than horses, and were well adapted to small farms. Mule breeding became a specialty in Kentucky, and many of the mule breeders moved west to Missouri to expand their operations after 1865. Louisville and Lexington Kentucky was mostly rural, but two important cities emerged before the American Civil War, Lexington, the first city settled, and Louisville, which would become the largest. Lexington, was the center of the Bluegrass Region, an agricultural area featuring production of tobacco and hemp. It was also known for the breeding and training of high-quality livestock, including horses. It was the base for many prominent planters, most notably Henry Clay, the politician who led the Whig Party , and who brokered important compromises over the issue of slavery. Before the west was considered to begin west of the Mississippi River, it was considered to begin at the Appalachian Mountains, and young Lexington was the cultural center of the region. It later claimed for itself the designation of \\"Athens of the West.\\" Louisville, located at the falls of the Ohio River, emerged as the largest city in the state. The growth of commerce was facilitated by steamboats on the river, and the city had strong trading ties extending down the Mississippi River to New Orleans. It developed a large slave market, from which thousands of slaves from the Upper South were sold \\"downriver\\" and transported to the Deep South in the domestic slave trade. In addition, to river access, the construction of railroads helped solidify Louisville's role as the commercial center of the state, as well as strengthening trading ties to the east and west, including areas around the Great Lakes. This central part of the state had the highest concentration of enslaved African Americans, whose labor supported the tobacco plantation economy. In the early decades of the nineteenth century, many families migrated from here to Missouri, carrying their culture, slaves, and crops with them, and establishing an area known as \\"Little Dixie\\" on the Missouri River. From the mid-19th century on, the city attracted many Irish and German Catholic immigrants, particularly beginning in 1848. The Irish were fleeing the Great Famine, wherein the potato crop, the staple of the Irish diet, failed for multiple years. The Germans came after the Revolutions in the German states of 1848. The Germans created a beer industry in the city, and both communities were part of increasing industrialization. These cities became Democratic strongholds after the Whig Party dissolved. Religion and the Great Awakening The Second Great Awakening, based in part on the Kentucky frontier, was the cause of a rapid growth in church members. Revivals and missionaries converted many previously unchurched folk, and drew them into the Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian and Christian churches. In August 1801 at the Cane Ridge Meeting House in Bourbon County, as part of what is now known as the \\"Western Revival\\", thousands of religious seekers under the leadership of Presbyterian preacher Barton W. Stone came to the meeting house. Preaching, singing and converting went on for a week until both humans and horses ran out of food. =Baptists= The Baptists flourished in Kentucky. Many had immigrated as a body from Virginia. For example, the Upper Spottsylvania Baptist congregation left Virginia and reached central Kentucky in September 1781 as a group of 500 to 600 people called \\"The Travelling Church\\". Some were slaveholders; among the slaves was Peter Durrett, who helped Capt. William Ellis guide the party. Held by Rev. Joseph Craig, Durrett was a Baptist preacher and part of Craig's congregation in 1784. About 1790 he founded the First African Baptist Church in Lexington, the oldest black Baptist congregation in Kentucky and the third oldest in the United States. His successor, London Ferrill, led the church for decades and was so popular in Lexington that his funeral was said to be second in size only to that of the statesman Henry Clay. By 1850 the First African Baptist Church was the largest church in Kentucky, black or white. Many anti-slavery Virginians moved to Kentucky as well, making the new state a battleground over slavery. Churches and friends divided over the issue of the immorality of slaveholding; in Kentucky the antislavery position was marginalized both politically and geographically. Emancipationist Baptists created their own churches in Kentucky around antislavery principles. While emancipationists viewed their cause as one with republican ideals of virtue, the proslavery Baptists insisted there was a boundary between church and state; this allowed them to define slavery as a civil matter. The proslavery position, based on the importance of slave labor on many plantations, became the dominant Baptist belief in Kentucky. Emancipationist leadership declined through death and emigration, and Baptists in the Upper South healed rifts in their churches and associations. =Disciples= In the 1830s, Barton W. Stone (1772‚Äì1844) founded the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), when his followers joined with the followers of Alexander Campbell. Stone broke with his Presbyterian background to form the new sect that rejected Calvinism, required weekly communion and the baptism of adults, accepted the Bible as the source of truth, and sought to restore the values of primitive Christianity. New Madrid earthquakes (1811‚Äì1812) In late 1811 and early 1812, Western Kentucky was heavily damaged by a series of earthquakes collectively referred to as the New Madrid earthquake. It included the largest recorded earthquake in the contiguous United States. These earthquakes caused the Mississippi River to change course.The Enigma of the New Madrid Earthquakes of 1811‚Äì1812. Johnston, A. C. & Schweig, E. S. Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Volume 24, 1996, pp. 339‚Äì384. Available on SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) War of 1812 Isaac Shelby came out of retirement to lead a squadron of Kentuckians into battle. Over 20,000 Kentuckians served in the various militia units. They played a major role in the west and in the victories in Canada.James Russell Harris, \\"Kentuckians in the War of 1812: A Note on Numbers, Losses, and Sources.\\" Register of the Kentucky Historical Society 82.3 (1984): 277-286.James W. Hammack Jr, Kentucky and the Second American Revolution: The War of 1812 (University Press of Kentucky, 2015). Mexican-American War (1846‚Äì1848) In 1846, Kentucky paid close attention to the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Some citizens enthusiastically supported the war, at least in part because residents believed victory would bring new lands for the expansion of slavery. Others‚Äîespecially Whigs, who followed Henry Clay, opposed the war and refused to participate. The quest for honor was especially important, as a rising generation sought their self-identity and a link with heroic ancestors. The state easily met its quota of 2500 volunteer troops in 1846 and 1847. Although the war's popularity declined after a year or two, clear majorities supported it throughout. Kentuckian units won praise at the battles of Monterey and Buena Vista. Although many took sick, few died. Gaining honor and glory, as well as emotional maturity and a sense of the world at large, Kentucky units returned home in triumph. The war weakened the Whig Party (United States) and the Democratic Party rose to dominance in the state during this period. It was particularly powerful in the Bluegrass Region and other areas that were developed as plantations and horse breeding farms, where planters held the highest number of slaves in the state. 1848 ‚Äì Largest \\"slave uprising\\" in Kentucky history Edward James \\"Patrick\\" Doyle, was an Irishman who sought to profit from slavery in Kentucky. Doyle was a shady, mercenary character who, prior to 1848, had been arrested in Louisville and charged with attempting to sell free blacks into slavery. Having failed in this effort, Doyle looked to make a profit by offering his services to runaway slaves. Requiring payment from each slave, Doyle agreed to guide runaways to freedom. In 1848, he attempted to lead a group of 75 African-American runaway slaves to Ohio. Though this incident has been categorized by some as a slave uprising--\\"the largest single slave uprising in Kentucky history\\"‚Äîit was not actually an uprising. The incident was an attempted mass escape. \\" The armed runaway slaves went from Fayette County to Bracken County before being confronted by General Lucius Desha of Harrison County, along with his 100 white male followers. After an exchange of gunfire, 40 African-American slaves ran into the woods, and were never caught. The others were captured and jailed, including Patrick Doyle. Doyle was sentenced to twenty years of hard labor in the state penitentiary by the Fayette Circuit Court for leading the largest mass escape in Kentucky History. The captured slaves were returned to their owners.James M. Prichard, \\"This Priceless Jewell ‚Äì Liberty: The Doyle Conspiracy of 1848.\\" Paper Delivered at the 14th Annual Ohio Valley History Conference, October 23, 1998. 1855 ‚Äì Bloody Monday: Know-nothing riots in Louisville With the rise of Irish, German, and Catholic immigrants, the white Protestants of English origin of Louisville started to take matters into their own hands. August 6, 1855, Bloody Monday, happened in Louisville, Kentucky on an election day. Protestant members of the Know-Nothing political party attacked German, Irish, and Catholic neighborhoods, assaulting individuals, burning and looting. These riots grew out of the bitter rivalry between the Democrats and the nativist Know-Nothing Party. Multiple street fights raged, leaving 22 to over 100 people dead, scores injured, and much property was destroyed by fire. Five people were later indicted, but none were convicted, and the victims were never compensated. Kentucky in the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865) By 1860, the population of the state had reached 1,115,684; of this number, 25% were slaves, concentrated in the Bluegrass Region and Louisville and Lexington. Louisville had been a major slave market, and shipped many slaves downriver to the Deep South and New Orleans for sale or delivery. Kentucky also had strong trade relations to both the east and western regions, reinforced by a shifting of trade from the rivers to the railroads and Great Lakes. Many Kentucky residents had migrated south to Tennessee and west to Missouri, creating familial ties to those regions. The state voted against secession and remained loyal to the Union, although there were disputes among numerous residents. Kentucky was a border state during the American Civil War. The state was officially neutral until a new legislature took office on August 5, 1861 with strong Union sympathies. The majority of the Commonwealth's citizens also had strong Union sympathies. On September 4, 1861, Confederate General Leonidas Polk broke Kentucky's neutrality by invading Columbus, Kentucky. As a result of the Confederate invasion, Union General Ulysses S. Grant entered Paducah, Kentucky. On September 7, 1861, the Kentucky State Legislature, angered by the Confederate invasion, ordered the Union flag to be raised over the state capitol in Frankfort, declaring its allegiance with the Union. In November 1861, during the Russellville Convention, Southern sympathizers attempted to establish an alternative state government with the goal of secession but failed to displace the legitimate government in Frankfort. On August 13, 1862, Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith's Army of East Tennessee invaded Kentucky and on August 28, 1862, Confederate General Braxton Bragg's Army of Mississippi entered Kentucky, beginning the Kentucky Campaign (also known as the Confederate Heartland Offensive). The Confederates won the bloody Battle of Perryville, but Bragg retreated because he was in an exposed position. Kentucky stayed under Union control for the remainder of the war. Reconstruction to World War I (1865‚Äì1914) Reconstruction Although Kentucky was a slave state, it had not seceded and was not subject to military occupation during the Reconstruction Period. It was subject to the Freedmen's Bureau oversight of new labor contracts and work to institute free labor. A congressional investigation was undertaken because of issues raised about the propriety of its elected officials. During the election of 1865, ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment was a major political issue. Kentucky eventually rejected the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth amendments but had to implement them when they were ratified. Democrats prevailed in the election, and one of their first acts was to repeal the Expatriation Act of 1862, restoring the citizenship of former Confederates. Postwar violence After the war, violence continued in the state. Numerous chapters of the Ku Klux Klan formed as insurgent veterans sought to establish white supremacy by intimidation and violence against freedmen and free blacks. Even after its suppression by the federal government in the early 1870s, between 1867 and 1871, the Frankfort Weekly Commonwealth newspaper reported 115 incidents of shooting, lynching, and whipping of blacks by whites. Historian George C. White documented at least 93 lynching deaths of blacks by whites in Kentucky this period, and thought it more likely that at least 117 had taken place, one-third of the state's total number of lynchings. While northeastern Kentucky had relatively few African Americans, its whites acted to drive them out of many areas. In 1866, whites in the county seat of Warsaw, Gallatin County, Kentucky, initiated a race riot. Over a period of more than 10 days in August, a band of more than 500 whites attacked and drove off an estimated 200 Blacks from the county, who fled across the Ohio River. In August 1867, whites attacked and drove off blacks in Kenton, Boone, and Grant counties; some fled to Covington, seeking shelter at the offices of the Freedman's Bureau there. In the 1870s, Willis Russell of Owen County, a US Marshal, fought against a KKK band who were terrorizing Black folks and their white allies in Franklin, Henry, and Owen counties. Similar hostile attacks greeted African Americans in western Kentucky, especially Logan and its seat of Russellville. Whites were especially hostile to black veterans. Racial violence increased in the post- Reconstruction period, reaching a height in the 1890s and extending into the early 20th century. This is when two-thirds of the state's lynchings of blacks occurred, marked by the mass hanging of four black men in Russellville, Kentucky in 1908, and a white mob's killing all seven members of the David Walker family near Hickman, Kentucky in Fulton County in October 1908. In an era of violence near Reelfoot Lake related to expansion of cotton culture and the Black Patch Tobacco Wars, these outrages received national coverage by major newspapers. Feuds Kentucky became internationally known in the late 19th century for its violent feuds, especially in the eastern Appalachian mountain communities. The men in extended clans were pitted against each other for decades, often using assassination and arson as weapons, along with ambushes, gunfights, and pre-arranged shootouts. Some of the feuds were continuations of violent local Civil War episodes. Journalists often wrote about the violence. Using stereotypes that city folks had developed about Appalachia; they interpreted the feuds as the inevitable product of profound ignorance, poverty, and isolation, and perhaps interbreeding. The leading participants were typically well-to-do local elites with networks of clients who fought on the local level for political power. Gilded Age (1870s to 1900) During the Gilded Age, the women's suffrage movement took force in Kentucky. Laura Clay, daughter of noted abolitionist Cassius Clay, was the most prominent leader. At the same time a prohibition movement began, which was challenged by the distillers (based in the Bluegrass) and the saloonkeepers (based in the cities). Kentucky's hemp industry declined as manila became the world's primary source of rope fiber. This led to an increase in tobacco production, which was already the largest cash crop of Kentucky. The first city to start using the Australian secret ballot in the United States was Louisville, Kentucky. The Australian ballot law was introduced by A.M. Wallace of Louisville, and enacted February 24, 1888. The act applied only to the city of Louisville, because the state constitution required viva voce voting at state elections. The mayor printed the ballots, and candidates had to be nominated by 50 or more voters in order to have their names placed upon the ballot. The blanket form of the ballot was used, with the names of the candidates arranged in alphabetical order according to surnames, but without any political party designations of any kind. Other changes in statewide voter law were made that increased barriers to voter registration, disenfranchising most African Americans and many poor whites through a combination of poll taxes, subjective literacy tests, and oppressive record keeping. 1900 ‚Äì Assassination of Governor Goebel In 1860‚Äì1900 German immigrants settled in cities in northern Kentucky, especially Louisville. The most famous ethnic-German leader in the late 19th century was William Goebel (1856‚Äì1900). From his base in Covington, he became a state senator in 1887, fought the railroads, and took control of the state Democratic party in the mid-1890s. Goebel's 1895 election law took control of vote counting away from local officials and gave it to officials controlled by the Assembly, which the Democrats controlled. He used that power to be certified as governor in 1900. The apparent election of William S. Taylor as governor on the Republican ticket in 1899 was an unexpected turn of events. The Kentucky Senate formed a special Committee of Inquiry packed with Democratic members. As it became apparent to Taylor's supporters that the committee would decide in favor of Goebel, they raised an armed force. On January 19, 1900, more than 1,500 armed civilians took possession of the Capitol. For more than two weeks, the United States watched as the Commonwealth of Kentucky slid towards civil war. The presiding governor declared martial law and activated the official Kentucky militia. On January 30, 1900, Goebel, accompanied by two bodyguards, was shot by a sniper as he approached the Capitol. Though mortally wounded, Goebel was sworn in as Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky the next day. He died from his wounds on February 3, 1900. For nearly four months after Governor Goebel's death, Kentucky had two officials functioning as the commonwealth's chief executive: Republican Taylor, who insisted he was the governor, and Democrat J. C. W. Beckham, running mate of Governor Goebel, who was sworn in when the latter died. Beckham requested federal aid to determine Kentucky's chief executive. The U.S. Supreme Court finally reached a decision on May 26, 1900, upholding the Commission's ruling that Goebel was Kentucky's governor. Since his lieutenant governor (Beckham) had followed Kentucky's line of succession, Beckham was now governor. Immediately following the court's decision, Taylor fled to Indiana. He was later indicted as one of the conspirators in the assassination. Attempts to extradite him failed, and Taylor remained in Indiana until he died. Realizing how close they came to civil war, Kentucky leaders calmed the voters and worked to finish the decade with less heat and little violence. Growth of coal industry The coal industry expanded rapidly in the state around the start of the 20th century and World War I. Many residents left subsistence farming to work in coal mining, particularly in the Appalachian region where large deposits of coal were found and jobs were plentiful. While coal mines provided new jobs, conditions were harsh for workers, and the mining created environmental problems for the land, water and air. World Wars and Interwar Period (1914‚Äì1945) Although violence against blacks declined in the early 20th century compared to the late 19th, it continued especially in rural areas, which were convulsed by other social disruption.Wright (1996), Racial Violence, pp. 99-100 African Americans were kept disenfranchised and as second-class citizens in the state. Many African Americans left the state for better-paying jobs and education in manufacturing and industrial cities in the Midwest as part of the Great Migration. Rural whites also moved to industrial cities, such as Pittsburgh, Chicago and Detroit. World War I and the 1920s Like the rest of the country, Kentucky experienced dramatic inflation during the war years. Much infrastructure was created; the state built many roads to accommodate the increasing popularity of the automobile. The war also led to the clear-cutting of thousands of acres of Kentucky timber. The tobacco and whiskey industries had boom years during the teens, although Prohibition, beginning in 1920, seriously harmed the economy when the Eighteenth Amendment took effect. German citizens had established the beer industry in Kentucky, which already had a liquor industry based on bourbon, and vineyards established in the 18th century in Middle Tennessee. Prohibition resulted in resistance and widespread bootlegging, which continued into the middle of the century. Numerous Eastern Kentucky rural and mountain residents made their own liquor in \\"moonshine\\" stills, selling some of it across the state. In the 1920s, progressives focused their attacks on gambling. The anti-gambling crusade sprang from the religious opposition to machine politics, led by Helm Bruce and the Louisville Churchmen's Federation. The reformers had their greatest support in rural Kentucky, with support from the chapters of the second Ku Klux Klan and Fundamentalist Protestant clergymen. In its revival after 1915, the KKK supported some general social issues, such as prohibiting gambling, as they promoted themselves as a fraternal organization concerned with people's welfare. In this era, their activities were largely concentrated in midwestern cities such as Detroit and Indianapolis, and western cities in Washington and Oregon. Congressman Alben W. Barkley became the political spokesman of the anti-gambling group and nearly secured the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1923; he also crusaded against the mining special interests that had so much power in eastern Kentucky. In 1926 Barkley was popularly elected to the U.S. Senate, as he had established his name and attracted support for his positions. With seniority Barkley became US Senate leader for the Democrats in 1937. Active in the national party, he ran for vice president with incumbent President Harry S. Truman in 1948. In 1927 former governor J. C. W. Beckham won the Democratic party's nomination as the anti-gambling candidate. Urban Democrats deserted Beckham, however, and Republican Flem Sampson was elected. Beckham's defeat marked the end of the Progressive movement in Kentucky. The Great Depression Like the rest of the country and much of the world, Kentucky faced great difficulty during the Great Depression, from the late 1920s to early 1930s. There was widespread unemployment and little economic growth. The people of Harlan County fought to organize unions in the first Harlan County Coal War, against the coal owners. Unions would eventually be established, and working conditions improved immediately. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs resulted in the construction and improvement of a great deal of infrastructure in the state. The construction of roads in rural areas, development of telephone lines, and rural electrification were significant developments. The construction of the Kentucky Dam and its hydroelectric power plant greatly improved the lives of Western Kentuckians. Flood control projects were also built on the Cumberland River and the Mississippi River, which also improved navigability of the rivers. Decades later, engineers have learned that some of these projects have increased flooding problems, as they increased the flow of rivers and reduced areas of floodplains to absorb the waters. The 1938 Democratic Senate primary featured an intense showdown between Barkley, liberal spokesman for the New Deal, and conservative governor Happy Chandler. The governor was a gifted public speaker, combining voice control, emotionalism, and singing with an unusual ability to personalize his speeches. His ability to remember constituents' names increased his appeal through his campaign speeches. But Barkley's methodical campaigning was bolstered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's strong endorsement following federal investment in the state. Barkley handily defeated Chandler, with 56% of the vote. Farmers, labor unions, and city machines all contributed to Barkley's margin, and the vote affirmed the popularity of the New Deal in Kentucky. A few months later, Barkley appointed Chandler to the state's other Senate seat upon the death of US Senator Mills Logan. =1937 flood= Beginning in January 1937, the Ohio River was in various flood stages for three months. The flood led to river fires when oil tanks in Cincinnati, Ohio were destroyed. One-third of Kenton and Campbell counties in Kentucky were submerged, and 70% of Louisville was under water for over a week. Paducah, Owensboro, and other Purchase area cities were devastated. Damages from the flood (nationwide) totaled twenty million dollars without adjusting for inflation. The federal and state government made extensive flood prevention efforts in the Purchase area, including construction of the distinctive flood wall at Paducah. World War II =Domestic economy= World War II demonstrated stimulated industry in Kentucky and other states, making it increasingly important to the economy. Agriculture declined in relative importancey. Fort Knox was expanded, with thousands of new recruits coming to the area. An ordinance plant was built in Louisville. This city became the world's largest producer of artificial rubber. Shipyards at Jeffersonville, Kentucky and elsewhere attracted industrial workers to their numerous skilled jobs. Louisville's Ford manufacturing center produced almost 100,000 Jeeps during the war. The war also led to a greater demand for higher education, as technical skills were more in demand both during the war and afterwards. Rose Will Monroe, one of the models for \\"Rosie the Riveter,\\" was a native of Pulaski County. =Kentuckians in the war= Husband Kimmel of Henderson County commanded the Pacific Fleet. Sixty-six men from Harrodsburg were prisoners on the Bataan Death March. Edgar Erskine Hume of Frankfort served as the military governor of Rome after its capture by the Allied forces. Kentucky native Franklin Sousley was one of the men in the photograph showing the raising of the flag at Iwo Jima. As a prisoner of war, Harrodsburg resident John Sadler witnessed the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, Japan. Seven Kentuckians received the Medal of Honor. 7,917 Kentuckians died during the war; 306,364 served. 1945‚Äì1980 In the years afterward, federal construction of the Interstate Highway System helped connect even the most remote areas of Kentucky to one another. Democrat Lawrence W. Wetherby served as governor during 1950‚Äì55. He was considered progressive, solid, and unspectacular. As lieutenant governor under Earle Clements, he had been out of the limelight. After Clements was elected as a US Senator in 1950, Wetherby succeeded to the office; he was elected to his own gubernatorial term in 1951. He emphasized themes of road improvements, and increasing tourism and other economic development. Wetherby was one of the few Southern governors to implement desegregation in public schools after the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which ruled that segregated schools were unconstitutional. Bert T. Combs as the Democratic primary candidate for governor in 1955, but Combs was defeated by Happy Chandler. Agriculture, though still important, was supplanted in many areas by industry, which stimulated urbanization. By 1970, Kentucky had more urban than rural residents. Although decreasing in overall importance, tobacco production remains an important part of the state economy, bolstered by a New Deal legacy that gives financial advantages to holders of tobacco allotments. In the 1950s, 13% of Kentuckians migrated out of state largely for economic reasons. Dwight Yoakam's song \\"Readin', Rightin', Route 23\\" is named after a local expression describing the route that rural Kentuckians took to find work beyond the coal mines. (U.S. Route 23 runs north from Kentucky through Columbus and Toledo, Ohio and to the automotive centers of Michigan.) Rather than the standard line that their elementary schools taught \\"the three Rs\\" of \\"Readin', 'Ritin', and 'Rithmetic\\", Kentucky residents used to say that the three Rs they learned were \\"Readin', 'Ritin', and Route 23 North\\". Civil Rights Movement In the postwar years, African Americans in Kentucky pressed for civil rights, as they believed they had earned them with their service during World War II and many other contributions, in addition to rights being provided by the US Constitution. During the 1960s, as a result of successful local sit-ins during the Civil Rights Movement, the Woolworth's Store in Lexington ended practices of segregation at its lunch counter and in restrooms. This was part of an era of activist efforts to achieve equal access to public facilities. Democratic Governor Ned Breathitt, took pride in his civil rights leadership after being elected as governor in 1963. In Kentucky's 1963 gubernatorial campaign between Republican Louis Broady Nunn and Democrat Ned Breathitt, the subject of civil rights and racial integration was a major campaign issue. During the campaign, Nunn attacked the Fair Services Executive Order signed by Bertram Thomas Combs (and three other governors, after conferencing with President John F. Kennedy). The Fair Services Executive Order had desegregated public accommodations in Kentucky, as well as requiring state contracts to be free from discrimination. Nunn, on broadcast television, promised Kentuckians that his \\"first act will be to abolish\\" the Fair Services Executive Order. The New Republic reported that Nunn ran \\"the first outright segregationist campaign in Kentucky.\\" Breathitt vowed to support a bill to eliminate legal discrimination. Breathitt wound up winning the general election by 13,000 votes. At the urging of President Lyndon B. Johnson, Breathitt led the National Governors Conference in supporting the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Johnson later appointed Breathitt to the \\"To Secure These Rights\\" commission, charged with implementing the Act. After Breathitt was elected Governor of Kentucky, the state civil rights bill was introduced to the General Assembly in 1964. It was buried in committee, and was never voted on. \\"There was a great deal of racial prejudice existing at that time,\\" said Julian Carroll. A rally in support of Kentucky's proposed 1964 civil rights bill attracted 10,000 Kentuckians, as well as prominent leaders and allies such as Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Abernathy, landmark athlete Jackie Robinson, and folk musicians Peter, Paul, and Mary. In January 1966, Breathitt signed \\"the most comprehensive civil rights act ever passed by any state south of the Ohio River in the history of this nation.\\" Martin Luther King Jr. concurred with Breathitt's assessment of Kentucky's sweeping legislation, describing it as \\"the strongest and most important comprehensive civil-rights bill passed by a Southern state.\\" Kentucky's 1966 Civil Rights Act ended racial discrimination in bathrooms, restaurants, swimming pools, and other public places throughout the Commonwealth. Racial discrimination was prohibited in employment and it empowered Kentucky cities to enact local laws against housing discrimination. The legislature repealed all \\"dead-letter\\" segregation laws, such as the 62-year-old Day Law, on the recommendation of Rep. Jesse Warders, a Louisville Republican and the only black member of the General Assembly. The 1966 Act authorized the Kentucky Commission on Human Rights to resolve discrimination complaints with enforcement for acts of discrimination. Breathitt has since said that the civil rights legislation would have passed without him. He thought his opposition to strip mining had more to do with the decline of his political career than his support for civil rights. 1968 Black power riot Two months after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, Louisville's West End rioted. On May 27, 1968, a protest against police brutality, held at Twenty-eighth and Greenwood streets, turned violent after Louisville police came and had their guns drawn when leaving their vehicles. Protesters reacted and violence ensued. Governor Louie B. Nunn called out the National Guard to suppress the violence. 472 arrests were made, $200,000 in damages happened, and African Americans James Groves Jr, 14, and Washington Browder, 19, were killed. Browder was found with a fish sandwich still clutched in his hand, shot dead by a business owner. Groves was shot in the back, after supposedly looting during the riots. 1970 UK anti-Vietnam war riots On May 5, 1970, one day after the Kent State shootings, University of Kentucky students burned down the ROTC building in protest against those shooting deaths by the National Guard and the Vietnam War. Governor Nunn called out the National Guard and the KSP to enforce a curfew after activists failed to heed UK President Otis Singletary's executive curfew edict. Reconstruction amendments ratified In February 1865, the Kentucky Legislature had voted against the 13th Amendment. On March 18, 1976, Kentucky finally ratified the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which are also known as the Reconstruction Amendments that provided rights to freedmen and persons of all races, with the signing of House Resolution 75 by Governor Julian Carroll. Mae Street Kidd, a legislator from Louisville, had campaigned for the state's passage of the three Reconstruction Amendments. 1981 ‚Äì present Martha Layne Collins served as Kentucky's first woman governor from 1983 to 1987. She co-chaired the Democratic National Convention in 1984. Prior to that, Collins had been a schoolteacher and party worker for the state's Democrats at all levels. She was first elected to office as lieutenant governor, serving from 1979 to 1983. In 1983, she defeated Jim Bunning for the governorship. Throughout her public life she emphasized education and economic development; a feminist, she viewed all issues as \\"women's issues.\\" She was proud of winning the Toyota plant for Georgetown, Kentucky, which brought substantial jobs to the state. In June 1989, federal prosecutors revealed that 70 men, mostly from Marion County but also two adjacent counties, Nelson and Washington, were arrested for organizing a marijuana trafficking ring that stretched across the Midwest. Authorities dubbed them as the \\"Cornbread Mafia\\" because members of their syndicate called marijuana, \\"cornbread\\". In 1990, Wallace G. Wilkinson signed Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA), overhauling Kentucky's universal public education system, and winning praise nationally for doing so. The Kentucky legislature passed an amendment allowing two successive terms for the governor's position. Paul E. Patton, a Democrat, was the first governor eligible to succeed himself. Winning a close race in 1995, he benefited from economic good times and succeeded with most of his initiatives and priorities. After winning reelection by a large margin in 1999, Patton suffered from the state's economic problems. He lost credibility as well from public exposure of an extramarital affair. Near the end of his second term, Patton was accused of abusing his patronage powers. He was criticized for pardoning four former supporters who had been convicted of violating the state's campaign finance laws. Patton's successor, Ernie Fletcher, was one of the few Republicans elected to the office in the state, serving from 2003 to 2007. In 2000, the state ranked 49th in the percentage of women serving in state or national political offices. The traditional system has favored \\"old boys\\" thanks to political elites, incumbency, and long-entrenched political networks. Democrat Steve Beshear was elected as governor in 2007 and for a second term in 2011. The state constitution limits governors to two succeeding terms. In 2015, Beshear was succeeded by Republican Matt Bevin. In 2019, Bevin lost his reelection to his predecessor's son and former state attorney general Andy Beshear. First state to adopt common core Kentucky was the first state in the U.S. to adopt Common Core, after the General Assembly passed legislation in April 2009, under Governor Steve Beshear, that set the foundation for the new national standards. In fall 2010, Kentucky's state board of education voted to adopt them Common Core verbatim. Since Kentucky was the first state in the US to implement Common Core, $17.5 million was received by the state government from the Gates Foundation. First Southern state to implement Obamacare Kentucky implemented \\"Obamacare\\"‚Äîexpanded Medicaid and starting Kynect.com‚Äîin late 2013. \\"Kentucky is the only Southern state both expanding Medicaid and operating a state-based exchange,\\" Governor Steve Beshear wrote in an OpEd letter to the New York Times, where he spelled out his case for the implementation of Obamacare in Kentucky. > [Kentucky] ranks among the worst, if not the worst, in almost every major > health category, including smoking, cancer deaths, preventable > hospitalizations, premature death, heart disease and diabetes. Right now, > 640,000 people in Kentucky are uninsured.

By October 2014, the number of uninsured Kentuckians had dropped by 42%. 521,000 Kentuckians signed up for healthcare using Kynect.com, Kentucky's state healthcare exchange website. Three out of every four people who purchased a private plan through Kynect.com got some kind of financial assistance, and about 75% of those who signed up had no insurance coverage before. \\"It's probably the most important decision I will get to make as governor because of the long-term impact it will have,\\" said Steve Beshear. First state to legally raise hemp On April 19, 2013, Kentucky legalized hemp when Governor Steve Beshear refused to sign or veto Senate Bill 50, allowing the state law to go into effect. Beshear had been one of the last obstacles blocking SB50 from becoming law. Under federal law, hemp is a Schedule 1 narcotic, like PCP and heroin, although hemp typically has only 0.3 percent THC, compared to the three percent to 22 percent usually found in marijuana. The Schedule 1 designation was exempted for Kentucky's pilot hemp research projects when the federal Farm Bill (a.k.a. The Agricultural Act of 2014) was passed. The state believes that production of industrial hemp can benefit its economy. On May 27, 2014, the University of Kentucky planted the second legal hemp crop in Kentucky. The first crop plot was planted earlier in May of the same year at Murray State University, using California seeds. With these plantings, Kentucky became the first state in America to begin hemp production. Katie Moyer, a farmer in Christian County raising hemp, boasted that hemp crops stop soil erosion. In 2015, Kentucky's Department of Agriculture received 326 applications. The Department of Agriculture is responsible for approving applications. All applicants must submit a business plan, as well as pass a background check to appease the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

Danske Folkeminder, √¶ventyr, Folkesagn, Gaader, Rim Og Folketro. Odense: R. Nielsen, 1877. pp. 93-102. Andrew Lang included it in The Pink Fairy Book. A version of the tale also appears in A Book of Witches and A Choice of Magic, by Ruth Manning-Sanders. It is Aarne-Thompson type 327B (a small boy defeats an ogre). In it, a boy named Esben outwits an evil witch to get the magical treasures for the sake of his brothers. Synopsis A farmer had twelve sons, and the youngest, Esben, was little while his brothers were big and strong. One day the brothers persuaded their father to let them seek their fortunes; he gave them each horses and money. Esben decided he would go too. His father refused to aid him. He took a stick and whittled it, so it was whiter than his brothers' horses, and rode off on it. The eleven brothers came to a house where a woman told them they could not only stay for the night, they could each have one of her daughters. They were pleased. Esben came up behind them and sneaked about. In the night, he had his brothers change caps with the girls. At midnight, the woman, who was a witch, came with a knife and cut the throats of eleven of her sleeping daughters, because of their night caps. Esben woke his brothers, and they all fled. The brothers left Esben behind on their horses. The brothers took service with the king as stableboys. When Esben arrived, no one gave him a place, but he managed to get his food with one thing or another. His brothers did not stand to attention for Sir Red, whom everyone else at the castle hated but the king liked. Sir Red decided to revenge himself by saying they had said they could get the king a dove with a silver feather and a golden one. The king demanded it of them. Esben told them to get him some peas, then he recited a charm to his stick, and it flew him back to the witch's. He had noticed she had such a dove; he spread the peas and caught it. The witch saw him too late to catch him, but they exchanged taunts. Angry, Sir Red claimed that they had said that they could get him the magical boar with silver and golden bristles. Esben made them give him a bag of malt, and using it, caught just the boar that belonged to the witch. The king was pleased with that, although his brothers did not even thank Esben. Sir Red claimed they had said they could get a lamp that could shine over seven kingdoms. This task, he had to sneak inside the house and hide. The witch called to her daughter to make her porridge and add no salt, so Esben poured salt into it. There was no water in the house, so the daughter asked her mother for the lamp to fetch more. Esben then pushed her into the well and she drowned, and he ran off with the lamp. After the king received it, Sir Red made a new claim, about a coverlet (bed cover) that sounded when touched. The boy tried to steal it, but it sounded and the witch caught him. But her last and youngest daughter took a liking to him, and together they twice tricked her mother into having him live in captivity. Eventually, when the witch had to go to a meeting of witches, Esben pushed the final girl in the oven and stole the coverlet. After all of her offspring have been destroyed, the returning witch was so furious she burst into small pieces of flint. His brothers were already in prison to be executed, but the king freed them. Esben also told him about Sir Red, and the king hanged him and rewarded all the brothers with gold and silver, and they returned home, telling their father how Esben had saved them.

As envisioned by the IJN, the cruisers were to play a key role in the Night Battle Force portion of the \\"Decisive battle\\" strategy which Japan hoped, in the event of war, to employ against the United States Navy. Begun in 1939, plans were far enough along that tests were conducted with the main armament and against the underwater protection. Even though the ships were approved for construction under a 1942 fleet replenishment program, the prioritizing of aircraft carriers and smaller ships due to the war, followed by Japan's defeat, killed any chance of the B-65's construction. Mission and plan The Japanese navy's experience in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, especially the Battle of Tsushima, strongly influenced the creation of the IJN's \\"Decisive Battle\\" doctrine, which guided the development and deployment of the IJN's battle fleet into World War II. The Decisive Battle concept was the IJN's primary strategy for defeating the navies of the major Western powers, such as Great Britain or the United States, in the event of war. The strategy consisted of four main components: a decisive surface fleet engagement determined by big guns, attrition tactics against a numerically superior enemy, a reliance on quality over quantity in naval weaponry, and the employment of nighttime torpedo attacks.Evans and Peattie, pp. 129‚Äì130 After the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the London Naval Treaty of 1930, each of which placed restrictions on the size of the IJN's fleet in comparison with the fleets of the western powers, notably the United States, the decisive battle strategy received increased emphasis within the IJN. In 1936, the IJN formed the Night Battle Force (Yasen Butai). As designed, the night battle force was to attack the hypothetical enemy's, usually envisioned by the Japanese to be the US Pacific Fleet, outer defense ring of cruisers and destroyers at night. After cracking the outer defense ring, IJN cruisers and destroyers were to launch torpedo attacks on the enemy's battleships. What remained of the enemy fleet was then to be finished-off by the IJN's main battleship line the following day.Evans and Peattie, pp. 273-276. The IJN assigned one division of fast battleships or battlecruisers to give additional firepower to the nocturnal attacks. The were initially assigned to this role and were upgraded to fast battleships over a seven-year period from 1933-1940. The IJN planned to eventually replace the four Kong≈ç battleships with four heavy, \\"super\\" cruisers. As envisioned by the IJN in 1936, these ships, the B-65 cruisers, would mount 310 mm (12.2 in) guns, carry armor designed to withstand hits from 203mm (8 in) shells, and be capable of speeds up to 40 knots. They would be designated as \\"super-A-class cruisers\\" to signify their greater status than the A-class ships (heavy cruisers).Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 86Evans and Peattie, pp. 275-277, 294; Lacroix and Wells II, pp. 250, 606.Perfect Guide to Japanese Battleships, p. 140 The plan for the cruiser class was finalized as part of the IJN's Circle Five and Circle Six warship construction plans of 7 January 1941. The plan called for six B-65s to be built in two increments, with the first two to be constructed in Circle 5 with the remainder in Circle 6. By this time, Japanese intelligence had learned the specifications for the United States Navy's large cruisers,Garzke and Dulin (1985), pp. 86‚Äì87 which had been authorized for creation by the passage of the Two-Ocean Navy Act and ordered on 5 September 1940. The Japanese believed that these ships would form part of the American battle fleet's screen in times of war. Thus, the B-65s were now intended to counter the threat posed by the Alaska-class cruisers.Evans and Peattie, pp. 359-360.  Design  Design work on the B-65s began in 1939.Gardiner and Chesneau (1984), p. 178 Preliminary plans for the new class were finished by September 1940, and they were far enough along that tests of the lower protection‚Äîthe armor intended to counter torpedoes and any shells that fell short but still hit the ship (albeit underwater)‚Äîand main armament were conducted from 1940 to 1941. on her trials in 1941. Had the Design B-65 ships been built, they would have borne a striking resemblance to this ship. These plans called for ships that bore a striking resemblance to the s, with the same \\"clipper bow, flush- deck construction, and a generally similar superstructure\\", albeit at a reduced size.

In an attempt to counter the Alaska-class cruisers guns, a proposal to increase both the main battery to six and armor protection to resist against the same was put forth. However, the increase in displacement (to almost ) and reduction in performance this entailed meant that nothing came of the proposed changes.Alaska-class cruisers were originally designed and ordered by the United States Navy because of mistaken intelligence reports stating that Japan was constructing \\"super cruisers\\" that would be much more powerful than the -gunned heavy cruisers the U.S. possessed. See: Gardiner and Chesneau, p. 122 and Final plans and cancellation As war with the United States loomed in 1941, the navy found that it had a more pressing need for aircraft carriers and auxiliary vessels. This need, plus a desire to complete the ongoing Circle Three and Four construction programs, delayed initiation of the Circle Five plan.Evans and Peattie, p 360. Following the Japanese navy's defeat at the Battle of Midway in June 1942, the Circle Five plan was significantly revised and Circle Six was postponed indefinitely. The new plan still called for the construction of two ships of Design B-65, which were given the hull numbers 795 and 796 with projected commissioning dates of 1945 and 1946, respectively. As the war progressed, however, strategic requirements further delayed the plans for the two cruisers. In the end, the B-65s' plans were never finalized and no contracts for their construction were ever placed.Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 84‚Äì85Lacroix and Wells II, p. 829.Jentschura, p. 40.

The cathedral's exterior, of red brick, consists of spires and a bell tower. It was designed by Dutch architect , son of Pierre Cuypers. The cathedral is the largest in Burma. Located on the grounds of the cathedral is Basic Education High School No. 6, which is locally known as \\"Saint Paul's High School\\", although it has no religious affiliation with the Catholic Church today. History of the origin and construction Construction began in 1895 and was completed 19 November 1899 under a land grant from the Government of India, whilst Lower Burma was a province of British India. During the 1930 Rangoon earthquake, St. Mary's Cathedral suffered little damage and it withstood the Japanese invasion during World War II. However, the cathedral's stained glass windows were damaged during the Allied invasion of Rangoon. Bishop Paul Bigandet's work for a new cathedral For some time before his death, Paul Bigandet MEP (1856-1894), Vicar Apostolic of Burma, started planning of a new and larger cathedral, as the Catholic community in the city was growing. It was decided that the new structure should take the form of a metropolitan cathedral of considerable size and of the best architectural design. A suitable piece of land measuring over fifteen acres east of St. Paul's High School was found, and the Bishop submitted an application to the Government of Burma, asking permission to sell, as a freehold, the site of the old cathedral, with a view to the proceeds being entirely applied towards the expenditure of erecting the new cathedral. The concession of the land applied for was, in the Chief Commissioner's opinion, excessive, but he was prepared to recommend that the government should sanction the grant of so much of the remaining portion \\"on either side of St. Paul's school as is at the disposal of the Government: viz, about five subsidiary buildings, provided that the site of the present Cathedral is relinquished to the Government.\\" The Bishop in his reply pointed out that his plea to sell the site of the old cathedral was based on similar concessions made by the government, only a few years previously, to other Christian communities. It was for the government to decide whether the Catholic community should be treated with equal liberality. Two months later, on 23 January 1893, the French Bishop was informed that the Government of India sanctioned the proposal to sell the site of the cathedral in Barr Street and to appropriate the proceeds for the erection of a new one. Just prior to the commencement of this project, Bishop Bigandet died. Bishop Alexandre Cardot and a new cathedral Bishop Bigandet was succeeded by Bishop Alexandre Cardot MEP (1893‚Äì1925). A deed of grant was executed and signed by the Secretary to the Commissioner of the Revenue Department and by Bishop Cardot. No time was lost in commencing the foundations of the future edifice. Under the supervision of Mr. H. Hoyne-Fox, consulting architect to the Burmese Government, plans for a Cathedral of the Byzantine model was drawn up. These plans provided for the erection of a dome over the junction of the nave, choir and transepts. As the first efforts to sink the foundation resulted in the discovery of a marshy and yielding substratum, it was decided to drive down into the substratum a series of pyinkado piles, eighteen feet long and three feet in girth as a basis upon which to build. This tedious work was started in June, 1895, and concluded on 1 January 1899. While these important changes were in progress, Bishop Cardot, at the urgent advice of his doctors, was compelled to go back to France. Mr Hoyne-Fox was proceeding on long leave, and there was no one to replace him in carrying on the work of supervisor and consulting architect. The Bishop, therefore, was asked to search in Europe for an architect. Father Hendrick Janzen and Bishop Cardot Among the students assembled for Ordination, one was noticeable for his pallid and worn aspect and emaciated figure. Bishop Cardot enquired as to his identity and learned that Rev. Father Janzen (30 September 1858 ‚Äì 1 Aug. 1911) had been sent home on account of his suffering from tuberculosis two years previously. Father Janzen had studied in the \\"√âcole Polytechnique\\" under Dr. Pierre Cuypers, a Dutch architect, who designed many of the catholic churches built in the Netherlands, as well as the Rijksmuseum at Amsterdam. Father Janzen had collaborated with Dr. Cuyper's son, Joseph Cuypers, himself an architect, in the erection of the Amsterdam museum. Bishop Cardot prevailed upon the Superiors of the Paris Foreign Missions Society to allow Father Janzen to accompany him back to Rangoon. Father Janzen went to his native Netherlands to consult his old classmate, Dr. Cuypers, Jr. who prepared a new plan for a French Catholic Cathedral in Neo-Gothic style. In November, 1898, Bishop Cardot and Father Janzen arrived at Rangoon. Father Hendrick Janzen and a new cathedral To adapt the existing foundation to the new plan, Father Janzen set about to extend the first plan. The altered structure was to be thirty feet longer and capable of seating 1,500 people. Thus, the size of the cathedral was in length and in breath. As a basis, a layer of sand nine feet in depth was substituted for pyinkado piles while an additional hundred of the latter was driven down to strengthen and support the rest. The cornerstone of white marble was solemnly blessed and laid by Bishop Cardot on 19 November 1899. Father Janzen found only bricks and cement, an army of untrained coolies and a few Chinese maistries. The secret of Father Janzen's construction lay in his close and constant supervision and in his patience and perseverance. Never tired of training and directing his subordinates, he simplified their labor by providing them with wooden rules, frames, and other devices to render their operations more mechanical and exact. By the aid of reinforced concrete and wooden moulds, he fabricated tiled and decorative blocks of every description. Many of them he bored through to make them lighter and to save material in such a way, however, as to interfere in no way with their strength and solidity. Father Janzen sawed through the connection between the towers and the rest of the edifice from top to bottom so as not to damage the main structure. The sinking slowly continued, so much so, that Father Jazen abandoned the idea of adding spires. The sinking stopped for more than a year and Father Janzen began the work of constructing the spires, 86 feet above the towers. Accident On August 11, 1907, Father Janzen slipped on a plank and fractured his thigh in three places. Father Janzen came out of the hospital permanently crippled. Thanks however, to the supervision of the Chinese maistry, Ah Yen, who for the preceding eight years had been his principal assistant, the construction continued. The Most Rev. Dr. Kelly, Archbishop of Sydney, had this to say in the Catholic Press of Sydney of the cathedral and Father Janzen: \\"The Cathedral at Rangoon, now almost complete in the exterior outline, is a work of genius, it has twin spires rising from its facade, and so setting their surmounting crosses as a to draw the visitor's attention. Father Janzen lives hidden away in his single room in the ground floor having but the plainest technical apparatus, restricted to very scant funds, and quite uncertain as to the future. For many months, he has been deprived of the consolation of celebrating Mass, on account of a fractured limb, which no longer serves for standing at the altar. Yet, the Cathedral works and keeps going; designs are forthcoming as required by each detail of workmanship; expedients for overcoming difficulties and for accommodating disarrangement are invented; and many curses, which have nonplussed professional skill in Burma, have been successfully dealt with by the wonderful spirit that dwells in the dying and broken body of this devoted priest.\\" Dedication The cathedral was dedicated as Our Lady of Immaculate Conception on 22 February 1911. The names of the chief donors were written on it, and it was signed by Rev. Father P. St. Guily. Five months after the dedication, on 1 August 1911, Father Janzen died and was interred at the entrance to the nave of the Cathedral. A plain inlaid marble slab indicated the spot whereafter \\"life's fitful fever, he sleeps well\\". A new Cathedral and sad disasters: The earthquake of May 5, 1930 wrought havoc in the city. The cathedral behaved splendidly under the shock it received. Only two interior vaults came down and others showed a few cracks. Two arches next to the towers were badly cracked but in a few months repairs were completed. The cathedral well withstood the Japanese bombings of 1941‚Äì42 but the Allied bombing of 14 December 1944 blew all the stained glasses to smithereens. They were redone with the ordinary local made glasses. On 2 May 2008, again the cathedral glasses were strongly hit and damaged by the Cyclone Nargis. This time, tarpaulin sheets were used to fix the broken glass, as it would've costed a lot for the glass to be replaced.

The area is now home to the City Without Walls gallery (cWOW), Newark Symphony Hall and the Newark School of the Arts. The main body of Lincoln Park is bounded by Broad Street and contains several statues including Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen, Planting the Standard of Democracy by Charles Henry Niehaus, and Captive's Choice, an historic statue erected in 1884 by Chauncey Ives, an American sculptor living in Rome, Italy. It depicts a young English woman who did not wish to return to her family after being held captive by American Indians during the French and Indian War. Lincoln Park also has a healthy and varied array of large, old- growth trees. In the early 20th century, the Lincoln Park area was a neighborhood of nightclubs known as \\"The Coast.\\" It was a center of jazz and a red-light district or \\"tenderloin\\" formerly called the Barbary Coast, after San Francisco's neighborhood. The Lincoln Park neighborhood has two community gardens.

An \\"Arts Park\\" is also in the planning stages in addition to new housing, stores, a restaurant, nightclub, music studio and dance studio. Lincoln Park has been designated an \\"Arts District\\" of Newark. While not a comparable artist colony in relation to cities of similar or larger size, Lincoln Park is home to the City Without Walls art gallery; the Newark School of the Arts, a heavily endowed performance and fine arts institution; and Newark Symphony Hall (1020 Broad Street), a venue for music and performing arts events and concerts. Several independent artists focusing on many types of media live in new or rehabilitated housing investmentsnew or rehabilitated housing investments that have been built since 2008 and continue to target spaces to artists. Because there is no organized membership or organization for artists, it is unknown how many artists live in the area. Several million dollars of capital investment has been made over the past 10 years in Lincoln Park, including some of the first LEED and eco-friendly certified buildings in the city. Lincoln Park is surrounded on three sides by more than a few small to large in-patient substance abuse rehabilitation facilities for adults and teenagers, mostly suburbanites who are court- sentenced into treatment and rehabilitation. The two main substance abuse treatment centers are CURA, Inc. and Integrity House, both of which operate several men's and women's dormitories as well as out-patient services along the park. Most of these facilities use re-purposed blighted brownstone buildings, former hotels, etc. that were abandoned and in disrepair until they were purchased and rehabilitated into substance abuse treatment facilities. In March 2014, Integrity House opened another 38-bed men's dormitory for in- patient treatment at 49-51 Lincoln Park. This left only a handful of abandoned or blighted structures surrounding Lincoln Park. The Lincoln Park community falls within the East district (or \\"3rd precinct\\"). Lincoln Park benefits from its proximity to mixed-use and non-mixed-use properties that include institutional, residential, horticultural, commercial, and educational facilities. Other notable buildings situated along Lincoln Park include: * Colleoni Apartments, also known as Lincoln Park Lofts, (39-41 Lincoln Park) a once blighted seven-story hotel, and later a tenement transformed into moderate-income housing that opened in 2008 after a multimillion-dollar top- to-bottom rehabilitation by Regan Development Corporation of Ardsley, New York, and now managed by The Michaels Organization of Marlton, New Jersey; * Lincoln Park Towers (31-33 Lincoln Park), an 18-story low- and moderate-income senior living community in an historic highrise that was once The Medical Arts Building, a medical and surgical facility; * Newark School of the Arts (89-91 Lincoln Park); * the Adelaide Sanford Charter School (51-53 Lincoln Park); * the Dryden Mansion, a center for non-profit organizations; and * The Newark Educators' Community Charter School (17-19 Crawford Street), a charter school converted from a 150-year-old horse stable serving approximately 200 students in kindergarten through third grade.

Hartford Gruber was born in Hamden, Connecticut, in December 1863. He began his professional baseball career at age 21, playing for the Hartford Babies of the Southern New England League. He compiled a 16-11 record and a remarkable 1.27 ERA in 241 innings pitched for the Babies. No records exist indicating where or whether Gruber pitched during the 1886 season. Gruber spent most of the 1887 season with the Hartford Dark Blues of the Eastern League. He compiled a 21-7 record and 1.48 ERA in 255 innings for the Dark Blues. Detroit After a second impressive season in the minors, Gruber was deemed ready for the major leagues. He made his major league debut on July 28, 1887, for the Detroit Wolverines of the National League. He appeared in seven games for the 1887 Detroit Wolverines, compiling a 4-3 record. His 2.74 ERA was the lowest on a team that won the National League pennant and went on to defeat the St. Louis Browns in the 1887 World Series. Gruber did not appear in any World Series games. In 1888, Gruber remained with the Wolverines. The team had finished in first place with a 79-45 record in 1887, but dropped in 1888 to fifth place and a 68-63 record. Gruber improved his ERA from 2.74 in 1887 to 2.29 in 1888, ranking as the ninth lowest ERA in the National League during the 1888 season. However, as the team's fortunes declined, Gruber compiled a losing record of 11-14 in 1888. Cleveland After the 1888 season ended, the Detroit Wolverines franchise was disbanded, and its players sold to other teams. In December 1888, the Cleveland Spiders purchased Gruber, Ed Beatin, Sy Sutcliffe and Larry Twitchell from the Wolverines. During the 1889 season, Gruber compiled a 7-16 record and 3.64 ERA in 25 games for the Spiders. In 1890, Gruber jumped to the Cleveland Infants in the newly formed Players' League. The Spiders in February 1890 attempted, unsuccessfully, to induce Gruber to disregard his contract with the Players' League and return to the Spiders, as reflected in this report from Sporting Life: > \\"A dispatch from New Haven, Conn., states that Secretary Hawley, of the > Players, has recently been in that city to induce pitcher Henry Gruber, who > has signed with the Cleveland Players' League, to throw up his contract with > the Brotherhood. Gruber refuses to do this and will stand by the > Brotherhood, although he is dissatisfied with the contract he has signed > with them, owing to the clause which provides that a player's salary shall > not be paid unless the gate receipts are enough to meet the expenses. He has > notified the manager that his salary must be sure and unhampered by > condition.\\" Gruber appeared in a career high 48 games and pitched a career high 383 innings for the Infants in 1890. However, Gruber's control of the strike zone declined markedly in 1890. After walking only 94 batters in 1889, Gruber walked 204 batters in 1890‚Äîthe third highest total in the Players' League. He also led the league with 36 wild pitches. In his Players' League debut, Gruber walked 16 batters in a 23-2 loss to the Buffalo Bisons. Gruber finished the 1890 season as a 20-game winner, but had even more losses with a 22-23 record. The Players' League lasted only one season, and Gruber returned to the Cleveland Spiders in 1891. He compiled a 17-22 record and 4.27 ERA for the 1891 Spiders. Coaching and minor leagues In 1892, while still under contract with Cleveland, Gruber was hired as the first professional coach of the Yale University baseball team. Gruber lived in New Haven and was hired for the position by team captain William H. Murphy.(\\"Henry J. Gruber, of the Cleveland team, has been engaged to coach the Yale ball nine in batting. His duties will consist of pitching to the principal candidates for the team three days a week, and pointing out their faults as batters.\\") Shortly after he was hired, in late March 1892, Gruber was hit in the ankle by a batted ball while training the players in Yale's gymnasium. He reportedly limped to the street and took a horse car home. Though no bones were broken, the foot became swollen, and he was unable to pitch for some time. Gruber did not return to the major leagues after the ankle injury, his last major league game having been pitched on October 2, 1891. He did continue to play in the minor leagues for another four years. He compiled a 22-17 record for the Troy Trojans in 1893, and an 18-15 record for the Springfield Maroons in 1895. Later years In January 1896, shortly after his playing career ended, Sporting Life published the following update on Gruber: \\"Henry Gruber is looking like a lord nowadays when promenading on Chapel street [in New Haven]. There is a certain dark-eyed young lady who seems much smitten with Henry, and there is no doubt but what her affections are reciprocated.\\" From 1897 to 1899, Gruber worked as an umpire in the Eastern League and the Connecticut League. In 1905, he became an umpire in the American League. Gruber died in 1932 at age 68 in New Haven, Connecticut.

Bacterial pili are used in the exchange of genetic material during bacterial conjugation, while a shorter type of appendages also made up of pilin, called fimbriae, are used as a cell adhesion mechanism. Although not all bacteria have pili or fimbriae, bacterial pathogens often use their fimbriae to attach to host cells. In Gram-negative bacteria, where pili are more common, individual pilin molecules are linked by noncovalent protein- protein interactions, while Gram-positive bacteria often have polymerized pilin. Some pilin proteins are Œ±+Œ≤ proteins characterized by a very long N-terminal alpha helix. The assembly of these pili relies on interactions between the N-terminal helices of the individual monomers. The pilus structure sequesters the helices in the center of the fiber lining a central pore, while antiparallel beta sheets occupy the exterior of the fiber. The exact mechanism of assembly of these pili from monomers is not known, although chaperone proteins have been identified for some types of pilin. and specific amino acids required for proper pilus formation have been isolated.  Development of molecular tools  Pili in Gram-positive bacteria contain spontaneously formed isopeptide bonds. These bonds provide enhanced mechanical and proteolytic stability to the pilin protein. Recently, the pilin protein from Streptococcus pyogenes has been split into two fragments to develop a new molecular tool called the isopeptag. The isopeptag is a short peptide that can be attached to a protein of interest and can bind its binding partner through a spontaneously formed isopeptide bond. This new peptide tag can allow scientists to target and isolate their proteins of interest through a permanent covalent bond. Role of ComP pilin in bacterial transformation Genetic transformation is the process by which a recipient bacterial cell takes up DNA from a neighboring cell and integrates this DNA into the recipient‚Äôs genome by homologous recombination. In Neisseria meningitidis, DNA transformation requires the presence of short DNA uptake sequences (DUSs) which are 9-10mers residing in coding regions of the donor DNA. Specific recognition of DUSs is mediated by a type IV pilin, ComP. Menningococcal type IV pili bind DNA through the minor pilin ComP via an electropositive stripe that is predicted to be exposed on the filament's surface. ComP displays an exquisite binding preference for selective DUSs. The distribution of DUSs within the N. meningitidis genome favors certain genes, suggesting that there is a bias for genes involved in genomic maintenance and repair. N-terminal extension The Saf pilin N-terminal extension protein domain helps the pili to form, via a complex mechanism named the chaperone/usher pathway. This protein domain is very important for such bacteria, as without pili formation, they could not infect the host. Saf is a bacterial operon. Function This protein domain, has an important function in forming pili. These are virulence factors crucial for cell adhesion to the host and biofilm formation with successful infection.  Structure  This protein domain consists of the adjacent Saf-Nte and Saf-pilin chains of the pilus-forming complex. They are Chaperone/usher (CU) pili, and have an N-terminal extension (Nte) of around 10-20 amino acids. Salmonella Saf pili, which are assembled by FGl chaperones. The structure has been well conserved, as they contain a set of alternating hydrophobic residues that form an essential part of the subunit‚Äìsubunit interaction. Mechanism The mechanism for the assembly reaction is termed donor strand exchange DSE which Pilus assembly in Gram-negative bacteria involves a Donor-strand exchange mechanism between the C- and the N-termini of this domain. The C-terminal subunit forms an incomplete Ig-fold which is then complemented by the 10-18 residue N terminus of another. The N terminus sequences contain a motif of alternating hydrophobic residues that occupy the P2 to P5 binding pockets in the groove of the first pilus subunit.

The Jamisons predictions have been featured in tabloid newspapers, and they have appeared in various media. They claim to have channeled the spirits of dead celebrities and predicted future events such as the September 11 attacks, however critics question the accuracy of their predictions, as well as the reality of their claimed supernatural powers.  Education and background  The Jamisons grew up in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Their parents, Jane and Philip Jamison, were writers and painters. The Jamisons attended Temple University, and later worked as painters and performance artists.  Career as \\"The Psychic Twins\\"  After leaving West Chester, the twins moved to Los Angeles and refocused their career as psychics, calling themselves \\"The Psychic Twins\\", reportedly charging more than $500 per person for psychic readings. According to the Jamisons, they have predicted the future and contacted spirits of the dead, such as Lady Diana, Natalie Wood and Michael Jackson. The Jamisons predictions have often been featured in tabloid newspapers such as The Sun, and according to the Jamisons, they have made numerous appearances in print, television, and on stage with \\"major stars\\". The Jamison twins maintain a YouTube channel on which YouTube stars Trisha Paytas and Shane Dawson have appeared.  Critical analysis  It is the opinion of scientific skeptics that mediumship is a con, and the claimed paranormal powers of the twins is no exception. The Jamisons widely claim to have predicted the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center during a November 2, 1999 interview on the Art Bell radio show. However, according to show transcripts, their actual statement was: \\"We are seeing terrorist attacks on Federal Government, excuse me, federal buildings. Particularly South Carolina or Georgia, by July 2002 and also the New York Trade Center, the World Trade Center in 2002.\\" The September 11 attack occurred in 2001, not 2002, and it was common knowledge that the buildings had been previously attacked by terrorists in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, calling into question the Jamisons' claims. Leon Jaroff, in Time, pointed out that the Jamison twins were also frequently incorrect. For example, in December 2003, the Twins predicted that Saddam Hussein would be killed by U.S. troops in early 2004, and that Pope John Paul II would die in June 2004 (he actually died in April 2005). They also incorrectly predicted that the Bush/Gore election would be a \\"crashing bore\\", and that actress Jennifer Lopez would announce that she was pregnant by June 2005. In September 2019, scientific skeptic Thomas Westbrook released a video dissecting the Twins's claims, including their most repeated claim of having predicted the September 11 attacks, and concluded that the twins demonstrate no paranormal abilities.

Licensed to Miami, Florida, United States, the station serves Miami-Dade, Broward, and most of Palm Beach Counties. WFEZ is owned by Cox Media Group. Its studios are located on North 29th Avenue in Hollywood, and the transmitter site is just south of the Miami-Dade/Broward County Line near Northwestern 215th Street and State Road 7 in Miami Gardens. History Early years, classical era as WTMI, and Dance era as WPYM (1971-2005) 93.1 FM was originally WKAT-FM, which began broadcasting on a full-time basis December 29, 1947. Later, the station became Classical-formatted WTMI, which began in 1971. For decades, the station also featured popular jazz broadcaster China Valles and his overnight show, \\"China's Jazz Thing,\\" Monday through Friday. At Noon on December 31, 2001, WTMI flipped to a Dance format and became WPYM, \\"Party 93.1, South Florida's Pure Dance Channel.\\" The station earned an \\"Innovators Award\\" from Billboard magazine in 2002 and a \\"Best Dance Radio Station Award,\\" at the 2004 Dancestar USA honors. WHDR \\"93 Rock\\" (2005-2010) WPYM's demise came on February 14, 2005. With decent ratings but poor marketing sales from non-local companies, Cox Radio took advantage of the sudden departure of WZTA (when it flipped from Rock to Hispanic Rhythmic as WMGE) by picking up the Active Rock format and taking the call letters WHDR, standing for hard rock calling itself \\"93 Rock\\". It became a mainstream rock station per Mediabase and Nielsen BDS reports in 2008. For a few years, the station aired Bubba the Love Sponge in mornings, which was syndicated from sister station WHPT in Tampa. WFEZ \\"Easy 93.1\\" (2010-present) On November 20, 2010, at 7 a.m., due to underwhelming ratings with their Mainstream Rock format, WHDR began stunting with Christmas music, with a new format to debut after the holidays. At Midnight on December 26, 2010, under the consultation of programming director and format architect, Gary Williams, the station flipped to a Soft AC format and became \\"Easy 93.1\\". The first song on \\"Easy\\" was \\"Easy\\" by The Commodores. The following day, WHDR changed call letters to WFEZ to match the new format. Unlike WPYM and WHDR, the station has become a runaway success. Since 2010, Williams has slowly evolved the station to a slightly more contemporary sound,bringing WFEZ to the top of the ratings in Miami/Fort Lauderdale market. In addition, Williams paired Hispanic radio market veteran, Giselle Andres with AC market veteran, Jeff Martin for morning drive. The pairing has proved to be quite successful. The EASY morning show is often ranked in the top 5 with adults 25-54 and 18-34. In 2013, WFEZ had the distinct pleasure of being nominated as a Marconi finalist for AC station of the year. With the success of WFEZ, several other radio groups over the past few years have launched their version of the format under the EASY or BREEZE format handle. In June 2020, Gary Williams exited after his position was eliminated. WHQT (Hot 105) programmer, Phil Michaels-Trueba assumed programming duties for WFEZ. Just sixty day‚Äôs after Williams‚Äôs departure, the sound of WFEZ began to change drastically. Once a super focused AC radio station, WFEZ suddenly drifted away from what made it famous with a more uptempo and contemporary sound. As a result, by fall 2020, ratings began to drop, no longer number one, but still a dominant brand in the market. WFEZ- HD2: Party 93.1 HD2 On March 24, 2008, Cox relaunched \\"Party 93.1\\" on the station's HD2 sub-channel. Like its predecessor, this version of \\"Party\\" is also running jockless, but the station's playlist has been broadened significantly, with more music from the trance and house genres. In March 2011, the station, which had only been available on HD Radio within the station's local listening area, began streaming on the internet again for the first time since 2005. As of January 2018, Party 93.1 HD2 is still broadcasting. However, its online stream and social media presence has disappeared.

The screenplay concerns Carola, a woman who falls in love in Kenya with Maasai Lemalian. The film is based on an autobiographical novel of the same name by the German born writer Corinne Hofmann. In the film version, names have been changed from those in the novel. Plot Carola (Hoss), a German woman living in Switzerland, is on holiday with her boyfriend in Kenya. She falls in love with Maasai warrior Lemalian (Ido), who is visiting dressed in the clothing of his area. At the airport on the way home she decides to stay. It turns out that Lemalian has gone to his home village in the Samburu District. Carola travels to the area, and stays at the house of another European woman. Lemalian hears about her stay and comes to meet her. Eventually they start living together. She travels to Switzerland to sell her shop there, promising Lemalian to come back to him. She does, and they marry and have a daughter. Carola buys a car and starts a shop. They lose money on the shop because Lemalian gives too much credit to friends and neighbors, and because they have to pay bribes to the mini-chief. Lemalian argues that this is no problem because she has more money in Switzerland. The mini-chief demands that Carola hires his teenage nephew as a shop assistant. She has to accept this although she does not need him and he does not work hard. After some time, when he is just drinking beer and not working, she fires him. Later he returns and attacks her. A local judge rules that she has to pay two goats for firing him, but the boy's family has to pay her five goats to compensate for the attack. Carola is frustrated by the female circumcision being practiced in the village. She wants to stop it, but it is a long tradition that is not easily changed. When Carola helps a pregnant woman in labour with a breech birth, Lemalian refuses to assist because the woman is supposedly bewitched. Lemalian does not want Carola to be friendly with other men, even if she is just serving a customer in a friendly way. He is very jealous and suspicious of Carola having a boyfriend. He even wants to kill a man he suspects. Carola wants to return to Switzerland with her daughter, stating she needs a two-week holiday. After some hesitation, Lemalian signs a form giving Carola consent to take the girl out of Kenya, although he suspects that she will not return.  Thematic content  The themes of the film have been controversial. Ultimately, the film is about the clash of cultures and worldviews. Two individuals who believe that their worldview is superior and therefore right (thus Carola condemns female circumcision because it does not fit her cultural outlook while Lemalian cannot understand how she could talk to men without being unfaithful to him), and it is their inability to understand the other that brings about their misery, separation, and divorce.

It should not be confused with the role and title of a \\"Conseil du Roi\\", a type of public prosecutor in the French legal system at the same period. One of the established principles of the French monarchy was that the king could not act without the advice of his council. Under Charles V, it was put forward that the king made decisions only after \\"good and careful deliberation\\" (), and this principle was maintained by his successors; the closing formula of royal acts \\"le roi en son conseil\\" expressed this deliberative aspect. Even during the period of French absolutism, the expression \\"car tel est notre bon plaisir\\" (\\"because such is our pleasure\\") applied to royal decisions made with consultation. The administration of the French state in the early modern period went through a long evolution, as a truly administrative apparatus ‚Äì relying on old nobility, newer chancellor nobility (\\"noblesse de robe\\") and administrative professionals ‚Äì substituted the feudal clientele system. The exact divisions and names of these councils varied over time.  Overview   Role  The kings of France traditionally always sought the advice of their entourage (vassals, clerics, etc.) before making important decisions (in the early Middle Ages, this entourage was sometimes called the familia), but only in the 12th century did this deliberation take the form of a specific institution called the King's Court (Latin: the \\"Curia Regis\\"). The Council had only a consultational role: the final decision was always the king's. Although jurists frequented praised (especially in the 16th century) the advantages of consultative government (with the agreement of his counsellors, the king could more easily impose the most severe of his decisions, or he could have his most unpopular decisions blamed on his counsellors), mainstream legal opinion never held that the king was bound by the decisions of his council. The opposite was however put forward by the States General of 1355‚Äì1358, and by the Huguenots and by the Catholic League in the second half of the 16th century. The Council's purview concerned all matters pertaining to government and royal administration, both in times of war and of peace. In his council, the king received ambassadors, signed treaties, appointed administrators and gave them instructions (called, from the 12th century on, mandements), elaborated on the laws of the realm (called ordonnances). The council also served as a supreme court and rendered royal justice on those matters that the king reserved for himself (so-called \\"justice retenue\\") or decided to discuss personally. Council meetings, initially irregular, took on a regular schedule which became daily from the middle of the 15th century. In addition to the King's Council, the consultative governing of the country also depended on other intermittent and permanent institutions, such as the States General, the Parlements (local appellate courts) and the Provincial Estates. The Parliament of Parisas indeed all of the sovereign courts of the realmwas itself born out of the King's Council: originally a consultative body of the Curia Regis, later (in the thirteenth century) endowed with judicial functions, the Parliament was separated from the King's Council in 1254.  Composition of the King's Council  The composition of the King's Council changed constantly over the centuries and according to the needs and desires of the king. Medieval councils generally included: * the crown prince (the \\"dauphin\\") ‚Äì if he was of age to attend the council * the \\"grands\\" ‚Äì the most powerful members of the church and of the nobility. Medieval councils frequently excluded: *the queen (both as queen consort or as queen mother) ‚Äì the influence of the queen lost direct political control as early as the 13th century, except in periods of regency; the queen thus only exceptionally attended the Council. *close relations to the king, including younger sons, grandsons and princes of the royal bloodline (\\"prince du sang\\") from junior branches of the family ‚Äì these individuals were often suspected of political ambition and of plotting. The feudal aristocracy would maintain great control over the king's council up until the 14th and 15th centuries. The most important positions in the court were those of the Great Officers of the Crown of France, headed by the conn√©table (chief military officer of the realm; position eliminated in 1627) and the chancellor. Certain kings were unable to reduce their importance (Louis X, Philip VI, John II, Charles VI), while others were more successful (Charles V, Louis XI, Francis I). In the 16th century, those \\"grands\\" with administrative or governmental competencies (religious dignitaries, presidents of provincial courts, etc.) were called to the council by a special certificate (or \\"brevet\\") and were termed \\"conseillers √† brevet\\". Over the centuries, the number of jurists (or \\"l√©gistes\\"), generally educated by the universit√© de Paris, steadily increased as the technical aspects of the matters studied in the council mandated specialized counsellers. Coming from the lesser nobility or the bourgeoisie, these jurists (whose positions sometimes gave them or their heirs nobility, as the so-called \\"noblesse de robe\\" or chancellor nobles) helped in preparing and putting into legal form the king's decisions. They formed the early elements of a true civil service and royal administration which wouldbecause of their permanenceprovide a sense of stability and continuity to the royal council, despite its many reorganizations. These counsellors, called conseillers d'√âtat from the reign of Henry III on, were aided in their tasks by the ma√Ætre des requ√™tes. In their attempts at greater efficiency, the kings tried to reduce the number of counsellors or to convoke \\"reduced councils\\". Charles V had a council of 12 members. Under Charles VIII and Louis XII the king's council was dominated by members of twenty or so noble or rich families. Under Francis I the total number of councillors increased to roughly 70 individuals (the old nobility was proportionally more important than in the previous century). The most important matters of state were discussed in a smaller council of 6 or fewer members (3 members in 1535, 4 in 1554), while the larger council was consulted for judicial or financial affairs. Francis I was sometimes criticized for relying too heavily on a small number of advisors, while Henry II, Catherine de' Medici and their sons found themselves frequently unable to negotiate between the opposing Guise and Montmorency families in their council. In periods of crisis, the number of members of the Council tended to increase: 100 councillors under Charles IX, during the worst moments of the Wars of Religion. From 1661 to the French Revolution, royal administration was divided between the various sections of the King's Council (roughly 130 people) and a small group of ministers and secretaries of state. The royal governmental councils (see below) were the most important and were presided by the king personally. Despite popular opinion, the king did in fact listen to his counsellors and often adopted the opinion of the majority: according to Saint- Simon (whose distrust of Louis XIV makes this statement all the more believable), Louis XIV only went against the advice of his council six times.  Royal Councils  Over time, the Council began progressively to divide intself into separate subcouncils according to the affairs to be discussed. As early as the 13th century, one can distinguish a small council of a few members ‚Äì the Conseil √©troit (\\"narrow council\\") or Conseil secret ‚Äì and a much larger council which came thus to be called the Grand Conseil. Under Charles VII, a subcouncil appeared to handle particularly contentious judicial affairs. An ordinance by Charles VIII in 1497, and reaffirmed by Louis XII in 1498, removed this body from the king's council and established it as an autonomous court with the institutional name Grand Conseil. The Grand Conseil became thus a superior court of justice (that the king did not attend) with its own legal and judicial personnel and with a purview over contentious affairs submitted directly to the king (affairs of \\"justice retenue\\", or \\"justice reserved\\" for the king). This removal of the Grand Conseil from the council apparatus permitted the remaining sections of the council to focus on political and administrative affairs, but the need for further subsections continued. Francis I created a Conseil des Affaires ‚Äì a small informal group reuniting the chancellor, a secretary of commandements and several other close confidants ‚Äì to deal with political and diplomatic issues, including war. The remaining large council (of 50‚Äì60 members) took the name of \\"Conseil ordinaire\\" (\\"Regular Council\\") or \\"Conseil d'√âtat\\" (\\"Council of State\\"), but lost in its prestige, all the more so given that the king no longer regularly attended its sessions; in his absence the large council was presided by the chancellor. After 1643, the \\"Conseil des Affairs\\" was generally known as the \\"Conseil d'en haut\\" (\\"Upper Council\\"), due to its rooms on the second floor of Versailles. Beginning in 1560, a separate council was created to handle financial affairs: the \\"Conseil des finances\\"; around 1600 this council was reunited with the state council as \\"Conseil d'√âtat et des finances\\". The \\"Conseil d'√âtat et des finances\\" lost in its prestige during the reign of Louis XIII and ended as a supreme court for legal disputes concerning royal administration and appeals on decisions from sovereign courts concerning finances and taxation. By the late 17th century, the council's role as adjudicator in administrative disputes was subsumed by the \\"Conseil d'√âtat priv√©\\" and its financial oversight was largely taken over by the later \\"Conseil royal des finances\\" and by the Controller-General of Finances. In the 16th century, with the Grand Conseil being a completely autonomous court of justice separated from the king's council, the need was seen for certain judicial affairs to be discussed and judged within the council. These special session trials gave rise to a new section of the Council of State overseeing legal disputes, which took the name \\"Conseil d'√âtat priv√©\\" (\\"Privy Council of State\\") or \\"Conseil des parties\\" (\\"Council of Parties\\", i.e. the party in a legal suit). In theory, the king exercised justice in this council with his regular counsellors, but in fact the council was presided by the chancellor and was furnished with a corps of legal personnel who dealt with Privy Council matters (the five presidents of the Parlement of Paris, the ma√Ætres des requ√™tes who brought affairs before the court, lawyers and prosecutors who represented the parties). The Privy Council acted as a supreme court, pronouncing judgements on the various sovereign courts of the realm (including the parlements and the Grand Conseil), and provided final judicial review and interpretation of law (the request for which was called \\"√©vocation\\"), oversight of the judicial corps, and judged disputes on royal offices, church benefices and problems between Catholics and Protestants. In this way, the Conseil priv√© was roughly the predecessor of the present-day Conseil d'√âtat. Before the late 17th century, the \\"Conseil priv√©\\" was solely a judicial council, but at that time it took over affairs of administrative disputes from the \\"Conseil d'√âtat et des finances\\" (which ceased to exist as such). This new council, called the \\"Conseil d'√âtat priv√©, finances et direction\\", was divided into three sections which met separately: the \\"Conseil des parties\\", the \\"Grande direction des finances\\" and the \\"Petite direction des finances.\\" From 1630, the \\"Conseil des D√©p√™ches\\" was created to deal with notices and administrative reports from the provinces sent by the governors and intendants. Despite these divisions into subcouncils, from a judicial point of view these various sections were all aspects of the same Council, and the decisions of the various sections were all considered to reflect the king's wishes. Even when the king was not in fact present as his councils, there were still considered to be presided over by him, and only the closing formula of their decisions changed: the expression \\"le Roi en son Conseil\\" was used when the king was not present at the meeting, the expression \\"le Roi √©tant en son Conseil\\" when he was. The subcouncils of the King's Council can be generally grouped as \\"governmental councils\\", \\"financial councils\\" and \\"judicial and administrative councils\\". With the names and subdivisions of the 17th ‚Äì 18th century, these subcouncils were: Governmental Councils: * Conseil d'en haut (\\"High Council\\", concerning the most important matters of state) ‚Äì composed of the king, the crown prince (the \\"dauphin\\"), the chancellor, the contr√¥leur g√©n√©ral des finances, and the secretary of state in charge of foreign affairs. * Conseil des d√©p√™ches (\\"Council of Messages\\", concerning notices and administrative reports from the provinces) ‚Äì composed of the king, the chancellor, the secretaries of state, the contr√¥leur g√©n√©ral des finances, and other councillors according to the issues discussed. * Conseil de Conscience (\\"Council of Conscience\\", concerning religious affairs and episcopal appointments) ‚Äì composed of the king, the \\"Principal Ministre de l'√âtat\\" when there was one and some other cardinals and bishops chosen by the monarch. Financial Councils: * Conseil royal des finances (\\"Royal Council of Finances\\") ‚Äì composed of the king, the \\"chef du conseil des finances\\" (an honorary post), the chancellor, the contr√¥leur g√©n√©ral des finances and two of his counsellors, and the intendants of finance. * Conseil royal de commerce Judicial and Administrative Councils: * Conseil d'√âtat et des Finances or Conseil ordinaire des Finances ‚Äì by the late 17th century, its functions were largely taken over by the three following sections. * Conseil priv√© or Conseil des parties' or Conseil d'√âtat (\\"Privy Council\\" or \\"Council of State\\", concerning the judicial system, officially instituted in 1557) ‚Äì the largest of the royal councils, composed of the chancellor, the dukes with peerage, the ministers and secretaries of state, the contr√¥leur g√©n√©ral des finances, the 30 councillors of state, the 80 ma√Ætre des requ√™tes and the intendants of finance. * Grande Direction des Finances * Petite Direction des Finances The King's Council also included various commissions and bureaus. In addition to the above administrative institutions, the king was also surrounded by an extensive personal and court retinue (royal family, valets, guards, honorific officers), regrouped under the name \\"Maison du Roi\\". At the death of Louis XIV, the Regent Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans abandoned several of the above administrative structures, most notably the Secretaries of State, which were replaced by councils. This system of government, called the Polysynody, lasted from 1715‚Äì1718.  Governmental Councils  Governmental councils were always presided by the King in person. Decisions made in these councils were called \\"arr√™ts en commandement\\". These councils met in the King's Apartment, in a room called the \\"Cabinet du Conseil\\" (present in all royal residences). Members were informed of meeting times by the king and the cabinet bailiffs, and at the beginning of the session the doors of the cabinet were closed and were guarded from outside, to prevent any interruptions or spies, as the meetings were secret. The meetings took place around an oval table with the king at one end, seated in an armchair; all other members were seated on folding stools (these folding chairs were symbolic of the council's itinerant nature, as the council was held to follow the king wherever he went). The king opened sessions by raising questions or by giving the floor to one of the members. Each member added to the discussion in the ascending order of their rank. Discussions concluded with a vote of the council's opinion (in the same ascending order; the vote was called \\"aller aux opinions\\"). In the end, the king made the final decision. Louis XIV very rarely went against the majority opinion of the council. Louis XV followed the same general rules but frequently interrupted discussion when it seemed to be going in a direction he disagreed with, rather than choose to go against the final opinion of the council. Meetings were typically longer than two hours and could go far longer. = Upper or State Council = Known variously as the \\"Conseil des affaires\\", \\"Conseil d'en haut\\" (\\"Upper Council\\") or \\"Conseil d'√âtat\\" (\\"State Council\\"), this was the most important of the royal councils and discussed the most important affairs of state. It was more or less the equivalent of today's Council of Ministers. The name \\"Conseil d'en haut\\" by which it was known from 1643 on (replacing the \\"Conseil des Affaires\\" of the 16th century) came from the fact that the council met in the \\"Cabinet of Council\\" on the second floor of the Ch√¢teau of Versailles next to the king's chamber. Before the reign of Louis XIV, it was an extremely small council bringing together the first minister (when one existed), the chancellor, the superintendent of finances, one secretary of state and the ministers of state (counsellors appointed by the king). The council's purview was very large. At the beginning of Louis XIV's reign, the number of members was increased: in addition to the ministers of state, the council included members of the royal family, princes of the royal bloodline (\\"princes du sang\\") and dukes with peerage (\\"duc et pair\\"). From 1661 on, Louis XIV reorganized the council and eliminated the use of regular or open membership to its meetings. Henceforth, no one, not even the crown prince (the \\"dauphin\\") could attend without an invitation, and attendance to the council meetings was given on a per-meeting basis with members needing to be reinvited to attend any subsequent meetings. The most frequent members of the council were the secretaries of state. In the beginning, Louis XIV admitted only three members regularly to the council (Michel le Tellier, Hugues de Lionne, Jean-Baptiste Colbert), and later increased this to five members. Louis XV increased it to 7 members and Louis XVI increased it to eight members. During the reign of Louis XV, the council, commonly called the Conseil d'√âtat, was generally focused on foreign affairs, naval and military affairs and, during times of war, military operations. At this time, the Council of Messages (\\"Conseil des D√©p√™ches\\") took over direction of domestic politics. The council was held on Sundays and Wednesdays, but additional meetings were frequent, especially in times of war. In all, the council met on an average 120 to 130 times a year, and more in some years. = Council of Messages = The \\"Conseil des D√©p√™ches\\" (\\"Council of Messages\\") oversaw the notices and administrative reports from the provinces sent by the governors and intendants, and thus dealt with domestic affairs coming under the purview of all four Secretaries of State. Created in 1650, it was originally presided by the Chancellor, but the King began to preside it himself from 1661 on. This council was made up of ten to twelve members: the first minister (when one existed), the crown prince, the chancellor, the ministers of state and the secretaries of state, the contr√¥leur g√©n√©ral des finances. Other councillors of state or ma√Ætres des requ√™tes attended according to the issues discussed. The council met originally twice a week. Under Louis XIV, the schedule was slowed down, as the king had gotten into the habit of discussing these matters with his one-on-one meetings with his ministers; decisions taken were presented as \\"arr√™ts en commandement\\" even if they had not been officially deliberated in council. Under Louis XV, the Conseil des D√©p√™ches was very active and became, for domestic affairs, the equivalent of the \\"Conseil d'En-haut\\" for foreign affairs. The council met every Saturday, and sometimes on Friday, but also came together for additional meetings, some for several days in a row, as was the case during the Fronde parlementaire under Louis XV. In this way, the council met fifty times a year, and more than seventy times a year during periods of crisis. = Council of Conscience = The \\"Conseil de Conscience\\" was created in 1720 by the Regent Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans to oversee implementation of the clauses of the papal bull Unigenitus. The council was kept after 1723 and met on Thursdays. Very busy until 1730, this council saw its influence decrease with the rise to power of Cardinal de Fleury, and the council disappeared finally in 1733. Presided by the king, it brought together the first minister (when one existed) and several cardinals and bishops, but no other ministers.  Financial councils  = Council of Finances = The \\"Conseil royal des finances\\" was created by Louis XIV in September 1661 to help the king oversee the functions of Superintendent of Finances after the removal from power of Nicolas Fouquet. Before 1661, fiscal matters were treated in the \\"Conseil de direction des finances\\", created in 1615, under Louis XIII. The Council of Finances' purview was large; it dealt with the royal budget, taxation, industry, commerce, money, contracts to the Farmers General, etc. In this council, the overall size of the taille was set, and financial and taxation disputes were judged. The council was made up of the king, the \\"chef du conseil des finances\\" (an honorary, but well-paid, post), the crown prince, occasionally the chancellor, the contr√¥leur g√©n√©ral des finances and (generally) two of his consellors, and the intendants of finance. Until 1715, the council met twice a week. After this date, financial decisions were made by the king in one-on-one meetings with the contr√¥leur g√©n√©ral des finances, and the council merely rubber-stamped their decisions without much debate. Under the Regent Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans and then under Louis XV, the council met every Tuesday. From around 1728‚Äì1730, its rhythm slowed to less than once a week, and during the years 1730‚Äì1740, it met only once every two weeks. In the early 17th century, legal disputes concerning financial matters were overseen by the \\"Conseil d'√âtat et des finances\\" (see Judicial and Administrative Councils below), although from 1665 on its financial purview was reduced as the chancellor was gradually excluded from financial decisions. = Council of Commerce = The \\"Conseil royal de commerce\\" was created in 1664 as an equivalent to the Council of Finances, but it disappeared in 1676, and reappeared in 1730. This council was never fully able to stand out from the other councils and its influence was minor. In 1787, it was reunited with the Council of Finances.  Judicial and administrative councils  The divisions of the King's Council concerning contentious legal, administrative and judicial affairs were generally presided by the Chancellor of France, and the king himself rarely attended their meetings, although all acts of these councils were considered to derive from him and the chancellor was considered the \\"king's mouthpiece\\" (\\"la bouche du Roi\\"). = Conseil d'√âtat et des finances = The Council of State and Finances (\\"Conseil d'√âtat et des finances\\" or \\"Conseil ordinaire des finances\\") was created in the beginning of the 17th century with various governmental oversight functions, including over financial matters. The council lost in its prestige during the reign of Louis XIII and ended as a supreme court for legal disputes concerning royal administration and appeals on decisions from sovereign courts concerning finances and taxation. The council had the same members as the \\"Conseil priv√©\\" (see below), but the \\"contr√¥leur g√©n√©ral des finances\\" played a greater role. The council began to fall out of use in 1665 and it disappeared entirely between 1680 and 1690. With the chancellor removed from the direction of financial affairs, Colbert was able to replace the ma√Ætres des requ√™tes in the council by his own intendants of finances, and financial decisions were de facto decided in the collegial atmosphere at the Control General and in the \\"Conseil des finances\\", thus dispensing of debates in the \\"Conseil d'√âtat et des finances\\". By the late 17th century, the council's role as adjudicator in administrative disputes was subsumed by the \\"Conseil d'√âtat priv√©\\" (see below). = Conseil priv√© or Conseil des parties = Known variously as the \\"Conseil priv√©\\" or \\"Conseil d'√âtat priv√©\\", or \\"Conseil des parties\\", the Privy Council was the main body for decisions on France's judicial system, and as such it was roughly the equivalent of today's Conseil d'√âtat. It was first created in 1557. With the \\"Grand Conseil\\" being a completely autonomous court of justice separated from the king's council, the need was seen for certain judicial affairs to be discussed and judged within the king's council, especially those in which the impartiality of the courts was called into question. These special session trials gave rise to a new section of the king's council overseeing contentious issues, which took the name \\"Conseil priv√©\\" (\\"Privy Council\\") or \\"Conseil des parties\\" (\\"Council of Parties\\", i.e. the party in a legal suit). The main area of jurisdiction of the \\"Conseil priv√©\\" was civil trials between individuals (especially in cases involving the prestigious families and possible conflicts of interest among parlementary judges) and conflicts of judicial or administrative jurisdiction. Like the \\"Grand Conseil\\", the Privy Council acted as a supreme court, pronounced judgements on the various sovereign courts of the realm (including the parlements and the \\"Grand Conseil\\"), and provided final judicial review and interpretation of law (the process of so-called \\"√©vocation), oversight of the judicial corps, and judged disputes on royal offices, church benefices and problems between Catholics and Protestants. Before the late 17th century, the \\"Conseil priv√©\\" was the solely a judicial council, but at that time it took over affairs of administrative disputes from the \\"Conseil d'√âtat et des finances\\" (which ceased to exist as such). This new council, called the \\"Conseil d'√âtat priv√©, finances et direction\\", was divided into three sections which met separately: the \\"Conseil des parties\\", the \\"Grande direction des finances\\" and the \\"Petite direction des finances.\\" The king rarely attended the Privy Council. Louis XIV came occasionally at the start of this reign, but Louis XV only attended two meetings (in 1762 and 1766). The king's empty armchair symbolized his presence. The council was presided by the chancellor seated to the right of the royal chair. The council was the largest of the royal councils, and was composed of the chancellor, princes of the royal bloodline (\\"princes du sang\\"), dukes with peerage (\\"ducs et pairs\\"), the ministers and secretaries of state, the contr√¥leur g√©n√©ral des finances, the 30 councillors of state, the 80 ma√Ætre des requ√™tes and the intendants of finance. In general however, only the counsellors of state, the ma√Ætres des requ√™tes and (at times) the intendants of finances attended regularly. Meetings were composed of generally 40 or so members, and rarely more than 60 members. The Privy Council met on Mondays in a special room, the \\"salle du Conseil\\" which was outside the King's apartment. At Versailles, this room was on the ground floor of the \\"Old Wing\\" and gave out on to the Marble Courtyard \\"(Cour de Marbre\\") and the Prince's Courtyard. Counsellors sat on armchairs of black leather, while the ma√Ætres des requ√™tes remained standing. After each session, the chancellor dined with the counsellors (called \\"Messieurs du Conseil\\"). The Privy Council was on vacation from October to the feast of Saint Martin. It held roughly 40 to 45 sessions per year and issued 350 to 400 acts. Before coming before a judicial session, affairs were submitted to the council by a ma√Ætre des requ√™tes and studied by a group of state counsellors. Special offices were created according to the matters discussed (there was thus a bureau of ecclesiastical affairs) or the type of judicial action requested (there was a bureau of \\"cassation\\" or appeals). In the case of matters concerning the acts of sovereign courts, the council generally began by asking the parlementary prosecutor or judge who had written the lower court decision to first present his reasons before the council. = Grande and Petite Direction of Finances = These two regular commissions (commissions ordinaires) took over the purview of the \\"Conseil d'√âtat et des finances\\" on fiscal legal disputes. They were composed of consellors of state and ma√Ætres des requ√™tes. The \\"Grand Direction\\" was overseen by the chancellor and the \\"Petite Direction\\" by the \\"chef du conseil des finances\\". The \\"Grande Direction\\" was the direct successor to the \\"Conseil de direction des finances\\" (supra), but had a minor role and only met 6 to 12 times a year. The \\"Petite Direction\\" consisted of roughly ten people and was created to prepare the work of the \\"Grand Direction\\" and to reduce its case load by judging the simplest of cases. It met irregularly, and disappeared around 1767.  Committee of ministers  Meetings of the King's Council were first planned by ministerial services, and then by the king with his secretaries and ministers. But for a time in the 18th century, agendas and meetings came to be planned in a committee called the \\"Committee of ministers\\", consisting of the members of the \\"Conseil d'En-haut\\" or of the \\"Conseil des D√©p√™ches\\" meeting without the king. Although there had been antecedents of this committee during the reign of Louis XIV and the Regency, it became a regular institution in 1737 under the Cardinal de Fleury. These committees were held every Monday until the death of Cardinal Fleury. Louis XV knew the risk of this committee, and in 1747 he mandated that the committee could not meet without his express permission, and generally to prepare decisions already decided on in council. In this way, meetings of the committee of ministers became far less frequent.  Administrative personnel  Under Henry IV and Louis XIII the administrative apparatus of the court and its councils was expanded and the proportion of the \\"noblesse de robe\\" increased, culminating in the following positions during the 17th century: * First Minister: ministers and secretaries of state ‚Äì such as Sully, Concini (who was also governor of several provinces), Richelieu, Mazarin, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Cardinal de Fleury, Turgot, etc. ‚Äì exerted a powerful control over state administration in the 17th and 18th century. The title \\"principal ministre de l'√©tat\\" was however only given six times in this period and Louis XIV himself refused to choose a \\"prime minister\\" after the death of Mazarin. * Chancellor of France (also called the \\"garde des Sc√©aux\\", or \\"Keeper of the Seals\\") * Controller-General of Finances (contr√¥leur g√©n√©ral des finances, formerly called the surintendant des finances). * Secretaries of State: created in 1547 by Henry II but of great importance after 1588, generally 4 in number, but occasionally 5: ** Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs ** Secretary of State for War, also oversaw the border provinces. ** Secretary of State of the Navy ** Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi (the king's royal entourage and personal military guard), who also oversaw the clergy, the affairs of Paris and the non-border provinces. ** Secretary of State for Protestant Affairs (combined with the secretary of the Maison du Roi in 1749). * Councillors of state (generally 30) * Ma√Ætre des requ√™tes (generally 80) * Intendants of finance (6) * Intendants of commerce (4 or 5) * Ministers of State (variable) * Treasurers * Farmers-General * Superintendent of the postal system * Directeur g√©n√©ral of buildings * Directeur g√©n√©ral of fortifications * Lieutenant General of Police of Paris (in charge of public order in the capital) * Archbishop of Paris * Royal confessor Royal administration in the provinces had been the role of the bailliages and s√©n√©chauss√©es in the Middle Ages, but this declined in the early modern period, and by the end of the 18th century, the bailliages served only a judicial function. The main source of royal administrative power in the provinces in the 16th and early 17th centuries fell to the gouverneurs (who represented \\"the presence of the king in his province\\"), positions which had long been held by only the highest ranked families in the realm. With the civil wars of the early modern period, the king increasing turned to more tractable and subservient emissaries, and this was the reason for the growth of the provincial intendants under Louis XIII and Louis XIV. Indendants were chosen from among the ma√Ætre des requ√™tes. Intendants attached to a province had jurisdiction over finances, justice and policing.

Knopf) \\"The Paranoid Style in American Politics\\" is an essay by American historian Richard J. Hofstadter, first published in Harper's Magazine in November 1964. It was the title essay of a book by the author in the same year. Published soon after Senator Barry Goldwater won the Republican presidential nomination over the more moderate Nelson A. Rockefeller, Hofstadter's article explores the influence of a particular \\"style\\" of conspiracy theory and \\"movements of suspicious discontent\\" throughout American history. Background Hofstadter adapted the essay from a Herbert Spencer Lecture he delivered at Oxford University on November 21, 1963. An abridged version was first published in the November 1964 issue of Harper's Magazine, and was published as the titular essay in the book The Paranoid Style in American Politics, and Other Essays (1964). The essay was originally presented when the conservatives, led by Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater (1909‚Äì1998), were on the verge of taking control of the Republican Party. Historical themes Recurring paranoia in American politics In developing the subject, Hofstadter initially establishes that his use of the phrase \\"paranoid style\\" was a borrowing from the clinical psychiatric term \\"paranoid\\" to describe a political personality, and acknowledges that the term is pejorative. Psychological projection is essential to the paranoid style of U.S. politics. Historical applications Historians have also applied the paranoid category to other political movements, such as the conservative Constitutional Union Party of 1860. Hofstadter's approach was later applied to the rise of new right-wing groups, including the Christian Right and the Patriot Movement. The political scientist Michael Paul Rogin, in his book The Intellectuals and McCarthy: The Radical Specter (1967), offered a thorough criticism of Hofstadter's thesis regarding the People's, or Populist, party of the 1890s and similar progressive groups, showing that the ethnic and religious groups that supported Joseph McCarthy and other \\"paranoid style\\" figures differ from those who supported the Populists and their successors, and thus that the origins of McCarthyism cannot be found within agrarian radical groups. Despite Rogin's work, the tendency to conflate left-wing and right-wing populism, ignoring significant differences between the two, remains a significant long-term effect of Hofstadter's work. Another aspect of Hofstadter's thesis has been challenged by Samuel DeCanio's 2013 article \\"Populism, Paranoia, and the Politics of Free Silver,\\" which argues that instead of being a paranoid delusion, the Populists' position regarding bankers' use of bribes to influence 19th century monetary policy was largely correct. DeCanio offers evidence that the Coinage Act of 1873, legislation that eliminated bimetallism and which the Populists' denounced as the \\"Crime of 73,\\" was influenced by bribes that William Ralston, president of The Bank of California, paid to Henry Linderman, director of the Philadelphia Mint. DeCanio's article includes a copy of the actual check Ralston used to pay Linderman, indicating the Populists' claims were far more accurate than Hofstadter ever suspected. A 2020 study claimed that President Donald Trump used the paranoid style (described by Hofstader) substantially more than his post-World War II predecessors. Legacy In a 2007 article in Harper's, Scott Horton wrote that \\"The Paranoid Style in American Politics\\" was \\"one of the most important and most influential articles published in the 155 year history of the magazine.\\" Laura Miller writes in Salon.com that \\"'The Paranoid Style in American Politics' reads like a playbook for the career of Glenn Beck, right down to the paranoid's 'quality of pedantry' and 'heroic strivings for 'evidence'...\\" Economist Paul Krugman titled a 2018 op-ed in The New York Times \\"The Paranoid Style in G.O.P. Politics\\" and explicitly referred to the 1964 essay. Researcher Travis View, who has extensively studied and written about the QAnon conspiracy theory for The Washington Post has described it in 2019 as an example of the paranoid style as described by Hofstadter.\\".Rozsa, Matthew (August 18, 2019) \\"QAnon is the conspiracy theory that won't die: Here's what they believe, and why they're wrong\\" Salon Several academics have suggested that Hofstadter's argument has been outpaced by events. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick has observed that Hofstadter's essay assumes \\"a presumptive 'we' -- apparently still practically everyone,\\" who regards conspiracy theories \\"from a calm, understanding, and encompassing middle ground.\\" Sedgwick, and later Gordon Fraser, argued that conspiracy theories after the middle of the twentieth century proliferated to such a degree that Hofstadter's imagined, rationally liberal audience no longer exists, if it ever existed in the first place.

In astrology, certain stars are considered significant. Historically, all of the various heavenly bodies considered by astrologers were considered \\"stars\\", whether they were stars, planets, other stellar phenomena like novas and supernovas, or other solar system phenomena like comets and meteors.Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos, book 1 Fixed and wandering stars In traditional astrological nomenclature, the stars were divided into fixed stars, Latin stell√¶ fix√¶, which in astrology means the stars and other galactic or intergalactic bodies as recognized by astronomy; and \\"wandering stars\\" (Greek: œÄŒªŒ±ŒΩŒÆœÑŒ∑œÇ Œ±œÉœÑŒÆœÅ, planƒìtƒìs astƒìr), which we know as the planets of the solar system. Astrology also treats the Sun, a star, and Earth's Moon as if they were planets in the horoscope. These stars were called \\"fixed\\" because it was thought that they were attached to the firmament, the most distant from Earth of the heavenly spheres. Stars and astrological degrees Certain of the astrological degrees were identified and known due to their association with a corresponding star.Vivian E. Robson, The Fixed Stars and Constellations in Astrology (Astrology Center of America, 2005, repr.; ), pp. 11 et. seq. The astrological degrees that correspond to individual stars must be corrected for the precession of the equinoxes, and as such the astrologer must know when any given position of a fixed star was noted, to make the necessary corrections.Nicholas DeVore. Encyclopedia of Astrology (Philosophical Library, 1947), sub. tit, \\"Degree\\" Stars in sidereal and tropical astrology Traditional Western astrology is based on tropical astrology, which presumes an equal division of the celestial sphere along the ecliptic into twelve equal parts, starting with Aries. Sidereal astrology, at once the oldest and a recently revived astrological tradition, is more observationally oriented and uses the actual observed position of the stars and the traditional divisions of the zodiac constellations as its starting point. As a result of the precession of the equinoxes, the observed positions of the zodiac signs no longer correspond to the signs of tropical astrology. Zodiac Traditionally, the most important fixed points in the heavens were described by the constellations of the zodiac. Ptolemy's account likens the influence of some of the stars in the zodiac constellations to the planets; he writes, for example, that \\"The stars in the feet of Gemini (Alhena and Tejat Posterior) have an influence similar to that of Mercury, and moderately to that of Venus.\\"Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos, book 1 ch. 9 \\"Those people wonder at the star.\\" The stitchers of the Bayeux tapestry believed that the return of Halley's Comet related to the Norman conquest of 1066. Non-zodiac constellations in astrology Vivian E. Robson notes that many of the traditional constellations outside of the zodiac constellations occupy large degrees of arc and typically compass several of the tropical zodiac signs. Ptolemy referred to stars by reference to the anatomy or parts of the constellations in which they appeared; thus Arcturus he named the \\"right knee of Bo√∂tes\\". Most of the Western names of stars, such as Algol or Betelgeuse, are Arabic in origin. In 1603 the Augsburg lawyer-uranographer Johann Bayer introduced the current classificatory system for the brighter stars, in which stars are identified as belonging to their constellations by Greek letters, in (roughly) descending order of brightness; so that Regulus, brightest star in Leo, is called Œ± Leonis, the brightest star of the Lion.Robson, supra, pp. 19-20 Astrological meteors Unpredictable observations in the heavens, including novas and supernovas as well as other phenomena in the heavens such as comets, meteors, parhelions, and even rainbows, were all collected under the name of astrological meteors. According to Ptolemy, variations in the magnitude of fixed stars portends wind from the direction in which the star lies.Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos, book 2 ch. 14 Etymologically, the word meteor describes any phenomenon in the heavens, and derives from the Greek ŒºŒµœÑŒ≠œâœÅŒøŒΩ (mete≈çron), signifying anything in the sky or above the earth; this is the shared origin of English words such as meteoroid and meteorology. These astrological meteors were typically held to be omens that presaged major world events. In De nova stella, Tycho Brahe, one of many astrologers who observed the supernova of 1572, stated his belief that the appearance of the supernova heralded the decline of the Roman Catholic Church and stated that the years 1592-1632 would be impacted by the astrological influence of the supernova. The years corresponded almost precisely with the lifespan of Gustavus Adolphus (1594 - 1632), the king of Sweden who championed the cause of Protestantism during the Thirty Years War. This apparently successful prediction won Brahe international fame as an astrologer.David Plant, Tycho Brahe: A King among Astronomers (skyscript.co.uk, first published in The Traditional Astrologer Magazine, Issue 8, Spring 1995), accessed July 14, 2011 Use According to Nicholas DeVore, while the fixed stars no longer are consulted much in natal astrology, they remain important in aspects of astrological divination such as judicial astrology. Those astrologers who include them in natal charts do not give a major star any significance unless it appears as part of a close conjunction with a birth planet, within 5¬∞ by celestial longitude, and 1¬∞ by latitude. They have no effect by means of aspect. A first magnitude or brighter star on the Ascendant or Midheaven in the horoscope may indicate celebrity. The two stars Aldebaran and Antares are said to produce stress when they transit one of the angles of the horoscope.Nicholas DeVore. Encyclopedia of Astrology (Philosophical Library, 1947), sub. tit \\"Stars\\", pp. 408- 409; \\"Astrology\\", pp 28-29. Some astrologers that consult the stars refer to their affects as paranatellonta, or \\"paran\\" for short. Paranatellonta are stars that fall upon one of the four angles of the horoscope (rising or setting, at the midheaven, or at the imum coeli) at the same time a significant planet is at one of those points. Thus, for example, if Sirius was rising while Jupiter was at the midheaven, Sirius would be considered a paran of Jupiter and could influence the way the astrologer interpreted Jupiter in that horoscope.Deborah Houlding, \\"Paran\\", in \\"Glossary of Traditional Astrological Terms\\", skyscript.co.uk, accessed July 15, 2011. Scorpio, depicted in Johann Bayer's Uranometria. The bright star in the body of the scorpion, ·æ≥ Scorpii, is Antares. Specific fixed stars Aldebaran Astrologically, Aldebaran is a fortunate star, portending riches and honor. This star, named \\"Tascheter\\" by the Persians, is one of the four \\"royal stars\\" of the Persians from around 3000 BC. These stars were chosen in such way that they were approximately 6 hours apart in right ascension. Each of these stars was assigned to a season, Aldebaran was prominent in the March sky and as such, it was associated with the vernal equinox. Its current celestial longitude is 09 Ge. 47 as of 2006Deborah Houlding, \\"The 20 Brightest Stars\\" at skyscript.co.uk; accessed July 15, 2011. The four royal stars with their modern and ancient Persian names were * Aldebaran (Alpha Tauri) vernal equinox is the brightest star in the constellation Taurus. * Regulus (Alpha Leonis) summer solstice is the brightest star in the constellation Leo. * Antares (Alpha Scorpii) autumnal equinox is the brightest star in the constellation Scorpius. * Fomalhaut (Alpha Piscis) winter solstice is the brightest star in the constellation Piscis Austrinus. To medieval astrologers, Aldebaran was one of fifteen Behenian stars, associated with rubies, milk thistles and the kabbalistic sign 25px. In Hindu astrology, Aldebaran corresponds to the Rohini Nakshatra. In Western Sidereal Astrology, computation is based on defining Aldebaran as 15 degrees Taurus precisely. Algol In astrology, Algol is one of the most unfortunate stars., also online on Bill Thayer's site Lacus Curtius: Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning Ptolemy referred to it as \\"the Gorgon of Perseus\\" and associated it with death by decapitation: mirroring the myth of the hero Perseus‚Äô victory over the snake-headed Gorgon Medusa.Robbins, Frank E. (ed.) 1940. Ptolemy Tetrabiblos. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press (Loeb Classical Library). , IV.9, p.435. Historically, it has received a strong association with violence across a wide variety of cultures. Medieval Arabic commanders tried to ensure that no important battle began whilst the light of Algol was weak.Ebertin, R., & Hoffman, G., Fixed Stars and their Interpretation, Verlag, 1971, p.24 Algol was connected to the prognoses in an ancient Egyptian calendar for lucky and unlucky days composed about 3200 years ago. The 17th century English astrologer William Lilly regarded any planet to be afflicted when within five degrees of conjunction.William Lilly, Christian Astrology; London, 1647; Ascella Publications reprint, 1999; p.115. As of 1986 its celestial longitude was 25 Tau. 55'48.Giuseppe Bezza, translated by Daria Dudziak, \\"Al-gh√ªl, the ogre\\", originally in Schema 3, December 1986; accessed July 15, 2011. Algol is also one of the 15 Behenian stars, Lyons, 1531/33. Llewellyn reprint, 1993; tr. J. Freake (1651), ed. D. Tyson, p.411. associated with the diamond and hellebore, and marked with the kabbalistic sign: 75px Gienah Gienah (gamma Corvi) is supposed to have a similar effect to Mars and Saturn, tending to promote greed and craftiness. It was one of the medieval Behenian stars, associated with onyx, burdock, and a crow-like kabbalistic symbol File:Agrippa1531 alaCorui.png. In this context it is sometimes referred to as Ala Corvi, \\"the wing of the crow or raven\\". Procyon Astrologically, Procyon is considered mostly unfortunate although it is sometimes wealth producing. It has strong potential as a cause of violence; it brings sudden success then disaster.Robson It is of the nature of Mars (and also Mercury to a lesser extent),Ptolemy and when Mars is found conjoined to this star, the native with this configuration will often be an offender of mischief and violence, that is, if these stars are found upon one of the 4 angles of the chart, during the day, with the Moon making a testimony to them while increasing in light.Maternus It is also one of fifteen Behenian stars, associated with agate and water crowfoot. According to Cornelius Agrippa, its kabbalistic symbol is File:Agrippa1531 Canisminor.png. Sirius In the astrology of the Middle Ages, Sirius was a Behenian fixed star, associated with beryl and juniper. Its kabbalistic symbol File:Sirius - Agrippa.png was listed by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa. Its celestial longitude was 14 Can. 05 as of 2006.Houlding, \\"The 20 Brightest Stars\\", above. Vega Vega (or Wega) takes its name from a loose transliteration of the Arabic word ' meaning \\"falling\\". Its constellation (Lyre) was represented as a vulture or eagle so that Vega was referred to as the 'falling vulture/eagle'. This is a Pole star. Around 12,000 BC the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega and through precession, the pole will again pass near Vega around AD 14,000. Medieval astrologers counted Vega as one of the Behenian stars and related it to chrysolite and winter savory. Cornelius Agrippa listed its kabbalistic sign File:Agrippa1531 Vulturcadens.png under Vultur cadens, a literal Latin translation of the Arabic name. Its celestial longitude was 15 Cap. 19 as of 2006. In Vedic Astrology the Nakshatra Abhijit is known as Vega.

The viruses causing fowlpox are distinct from one another but antigenically similar, possible hosts including chickens, turkeys, quail, canaries, pigeons, and many other species of birds. There are two forms of the disease. The first is spread by biting insects (especially mosquitoes) and wound contamination and causes lesions on the comb, wattles, and beak. Birds affected by this form usually recover within a few weeks. The second form is spread by inhalation of the virus and causes a diphtheritic membrane to form in the mouth, pharynx, larynx, and sometimes the trachea. The prognosis for this form is poor. Fowlpox in chickens Fowlpox is a common disease in backyard chickens that have not been vaccinated. Most birds survive the infections, although very young or weak birds may be lost. The lesions initially looks like a whitish blister and appear on the comb, wattles and other skin areas. In rare cases lesions can be found on the body, legs and even sometimes the softer parts of the beak. The blisters develop into a dark scab and take about three weeks to heal and drop off. Fowlpox lesions, when in the infected birds mouth and throat can cause difficulty breathing, even death. Scarring may result and consequently exhibition poultry breeders prefer to vaccinate and avoid this disease. Management of the mosquito population can help reduce outbreaks of fowlpox. Treatment Vaccines are available for fowlpox (ATCvet code: ). Chicken are usually vaccinated with pigeonpox virus. This vaccine is usually given to chickens when between the age of 8-14 weeks of age, via the wing web method of injection. When a bird is given the vaccine they are exposed to a mild version of the active virus, so they should be completely healthy to prevent severe illness. Turkeys are also routinely vaccinated. Once a bird is infected there are no treatments, just preventive measures including the vaccine and mosquito management.

The station runs on a full-time, multi-format schedule featuring a wide variety of programming. \\"The LION 90.7fm\\" transmits to a potential audience of over 125,000 from its studio in the Hetzel Union Building (HUB)-Robeson Center. The station also has a live webcast, which is capable of streaming live to hundreds of listeners. WKPS is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with the primary goal being to serve the campus and local community and secondary goals being the training, education and instruction of students in broadcast radio and station management. The station is run entirely by Penn State undergraduates, and maintains its tradition of public service by allowing student broadcasters from any academic major and community broadcasters local to the area. It also retains its programmatic independence by remaining unaffiliated with any academic college. History WPSC WPSC, Penn State's original student station, emerged from the Senior Gift of the Class of 1912. Initially an experimental shortwave installation, it represented ‚Äúthe first licensed club in the nation\\" and possessed \\"one of the first experimental licenses\\" granted by the government. By 1921 WPSC was broadcasting on the AM dial at 500 watts and was one of the earliest college radio stations in the nation. Due to a combination of the Great Depression and increasing costs of regulatory compliance, the station ceased operations in 1932. Today, the WPSC call letters are assigned to William Paterson University. WDFM In an effort to reestablish the tradition of student radio at Penn State, WDFM went on the air on December 6, 1953 as a result of the Senior Gift of the Class of 1951. Headquarters in 304 Sparks on the University Park campus, WDFM served its student audience for more than three decades. It changed its call letters to WPSU-FM in 1985. From the 1980s onward, student programming was progressively cut back. Later in the decade, more NPR programming was added to the schedule. By 1992, WPSU had become a full-fledged NPR affiliate with very few student ties and very little student programming. Despite the fact that the \\"new\\" radio station's mission and goals were dissimlar to those of early WDFM, the university allowed WPSU to exist. Residence Hall Stations =WHR (West Halls Radio)= Founded in the 1960s, WHR was the first of three stations at Penn State specific to University Park residence halls. WHR, which stood for West Halls Radio, rebroadcast the WDFM signal and also produced and broadcast original content to its area residence halls. =WEHR (East Halls Radio)= right On the AM dial, there also existed WEHR, a radio station in Penn State's East Residence Halls (\\"EHR\\" stands for \\"East Halls Radio\\"). At one time, three of Penn State's five residence areas possessed their own stations. WEHR was a typical freeform radio station; its playlist depended on the deejay. Founded in 1972, WEHR originally broadcast from 10 Geary Hall, moving to 104 Johnston Commons sometime in the early 1980s. The station was set up to broadcast through the electric system in the dormitories of East Halls, via a carrier current, a system that failed miserably, so the station's main broadcast was through speakers into Johnston and Findlay commons. At some point, the station lost its ability to transmit over the radio dial and was forced to accept being heard infrequently on Penn State University's House and Food Services (HFS) Channel 21 on the on-campus cable television system. The last broadcast schedule was posted on the station's website in 2005. Since that time, with limited resources, finances and student interest, WEHR ceased to function. The last staff to operate East Halls radio was Evan Raffel as General Manager, Alex Kozak and Programming Director, Jack Greening as deejay, Michael Boyson as Treasurer and James Peters as Business Manager. East Halls radio facility was said to house potentially the largest student archive of vinyl on-campus. From 1995 until 2005, Penn State had two student-run radio stations. By 2005, only WKPS remained. =WSHR (South Halls Radio)= Founded in the same year as WEHR, South Halls Radio was similarly inspired by WHR. Like its sister stations serving residence halls, it existed alongside WDFM, WHR, and WEHR to serve its student audience. Establishment of WKPS A growing number of students in the early 1990s, having become aware of the lack of student broadcasting options on WPSU and disillusioned with their options, decided to give student radio another try. A small group, led by Jeff Ecker, asked the university to provide funding to begin a brand-new student-run radio station in the tradition of WDFM prior to its professionalization. The new station would seek to serve the listening community by providing alternative and cultural programming not found in local commercial radio. WKPS went on the air on Halloween on Tuesday, October 31, 1995. The first song ever played on its airwaves was \\"Please Play This Song on the Radio\\" by NOFX. rightWKPS was chartered as a student club under Penn State's Office of Student Affairs in order to avoid a fate similar to that of WDFM, which had been created as a subsidiary of the College of Communications. Though this move would prove problematic for the radio station in the future, it was ultimately heralded as the decision which would keep the station firmly within the students' grasp. Lacking in any professional oversight, the early radio station relied heavily on the staff of WPSU-FM 91.5 FM, with whom they shared the University-rented James building (also shared by the Daily Collegian). Any oversight and support were extremely short-lived, however: WPSU relocated in May 1998. As per its FCC licensure, WKPS tweaked the original goals of WDFM, citing primarily the need to provide for the State College community and Penn State students with public service; secondarily, the need to provide a hands-on, co-curricular learning environment for students of any academic major interested in broadcast media; and finally, to provide a recreational extracurricular activity for students. Therefore, WKPS was open to students of all majors, not specifically those in the College of Communications for broadcast media. The station offered opportunities that the previous student radio stations hadn't seen including, in 1999, the start of students broadcasting Penn State football, and in 2001, the start of internet web-streaming of the station. Incidentally, \\"WKPS\\" was the fictitious student radio station featured in the 1990 film \\"Pump Up The Volume\\" starring Christian Slater. Problems with communication The 2000-2001 academic year was busy for WKPS. Officers of the station, including Michael D. Walsh, began restructuring the station's image and unveiled the \\"new\\" station as \\"The LION 90.7fm.\\" This academic year, however, would prove to be a difficult one for the radio station. Members on the original Student Organization Budgeting Committee (SOBC) had graduated and, though WKPS had been given generous funding in the past, the funding began to decrease in amount each year as student board members began to graduate. By 2000, students in the University Park Allocations Committee (which replaced the SOBC) were not so inclined to give the station money. UPAC cut funding for The Lion 90.7FM by 80 percent during the 2000-2001 academic year, a decrease which nearly crippled the station. Student General Manager Mike Walsh secured funding from the office of Student Affairs, with its Vice President Bill Asbury allegedly promising to provide funding support for an additional five years. The exact terms of this verbal contract are contested‚Äîwhen Vicky Triponey became the Vice President of Student Affairs, the University claimed Asbury only promised three years. In order to secure more professional oversight for the station, The LION 90.7fm attempted the following year to create a mutually beneficial partnership with Penn State's College of Communications. The University agreed to create such a relationship, and the office of Student Affairs and the College of Communications each offered to pay half of the salary for a faculty adviser, which the new station had lacked since its inception. The relationship deteriorated rapidly. Jeff Brown, the faculty adviser, quickly moved to promote the agenda of the College of Communications - to create an exclusively co-curricular experience - without regard to the station's stated goals or charter as an extracurricular club in Student Affairs. The rocky relationship continued and reached a boiling point when the College wired its student news studio into the station's sound board without proper communication or permission, leading to an incident known locally as \\"The LION Riot\\". It was at this time that faculty members of the College of Communications entered the WKPS studios while students were broadcasting live, proceeding to reprimand student broadcasters on-air for a perceived failure to broadcast a curricular- focused campus news segment. The LION 90.7fm still references this incident from time to time through audio imaging on the station. An article and partial transcript of the incident was published by a local independent newspaper, and complete audio of the incident continues to exist online. WKPS funding controversy Student staffers had only begun to get settled, however, when in 2004, newly installed Vice President of Student Affairs Vicky Triponey cut all funding to the radio station. Though she allegedly cited WKPS's flagship talk show Radio Free Penn State as the cause, she denied that its administratively-critical tack led to her decision. Instead, she claimed that The Lion 90.7FM was only promised three years of support by Asbury, a charge Asbury himself did not contest. The station managed to stay afloat, and with charitable contributions from listeners and alumni and help from UPAC, The Lion 90.7FM maintained its position in the Penn State Community. HUB-Robeson Center.250pxright In late 2005, student General Manager Brandon W. Peach assumed the responsibility for putting the station back on the right financial track. While the problems with the administration would continue to grow, the radio station has been able to procure aid from alternate sources and continue to provide an outlet for multi-format student radio. In 2006, the Alumni Interest Group renewed the station's FCC License, held by the Penn State Board of Trustees for another eight-year term. Faculty adviser Robert Zimmerman died on Monday, January 15, 2007, due to an allergic reaction to medication. He was 73 years old. The LION 90.7fm continued to operate, but was financially jeopardized due to high operating expenses and limited income sources. =Aftermath of the Funding Controversy= By the summer of 2002, the relationship with the College of Communications had dissolved entirely, and Student Affairs were no longer willing to pay half of the adviser's salary. Recent graduate and former WKPS officer Christopher Buchignani was hired for substantially less to replace Jeff Brown for one year. In the summer of 2003, the College of Communications, who leased the space in the James Building, forced The LION 90.7fm to evict. Dr. Stanley Latta, Director of Unions & Student Activities under Penn State's office of Student Affairs, authorized the station's move to the Hetzel Union Building. Room 9, right next to the HUB's large aquarium, was designated the main studio, with additional offices (one of which would become The Lion's production room) allotted to the station on floor three. On October 1, 2003, the station went live from Room 9. Though the new station was smaller than the station to which the staff had become accustomed, it allowed for The LION 90.7fm to be physically independent. Live webcasts, added to the station's website the previous year, were launched for student and community audience of both State College residents and distant alumni. The webcasts continue to be popular, nearly reaching their listener capacity limit each time The LION 90.7fm broadcasts a Penn State football game. Alumni Interest Group The LION 90.7fm's 2015 \\"Room 37\\" HUB-Robeson Center facilities.In 2008, then-President & General Manager Tom Shakely began working with alumni to resuscitate the Penn State Student Radio Alumni Interest Group, an affiliate non-profit organization of the Penn State Alumni Association. The Alumni Interest Group had been founded in 2005 by then- faculty adviser Robert K. Zimmerman, but had become inactive after his death in 2007. Mike Gogel, a former President & General Manager of WKPS, became president of the Alumni Interest Group in 2009. During his two-year tenure the group created The Robert K. Zimmerman Endowment for Student Broadcasting at Penn State, the first endowed fund benefiting WKPS to support the perpetual financial needs of student broadcasting. In 2011, another former President & General Manager, Brandon W. Peach, was elected to head the Alumni Interest Group. During his tenure the name of the group changed to the Penn State Media Association, while its mission expanded beyond traditional broadcasting to foster \\"relationships across the Penn State community for the purpose of connecting students, alumni, professors, and friends passionate about creating and promoting a more robust cultural environment through media.\\" Specifically, the Penn State Media Association re-imagined its role in order to \\"support a diversity of student media endeavors, and relatedly, to promote a holistic approach to supporting student media that recognizes the interdisciplinary nature of contemporary media.\\" In 2014 the Penn State Media Association launched its second capital campaign, this time to create the \\"Penn State Media Association Trustee Scholarship for Student Broadcasters.\\" The capital campaign seeks to endow this scholarship to benefit WKPS students with demonstrated financial need, and once realized will produce more than $10,000 annually in available scholarship assistance to student broadcasters.

She began her career in the 1960s as a model for Parisian Haute Couture Houses of Nina Ricci, Jean Patou, and Andr√© Courr√®ges. At the time models had to provide their own shoes to match the clothes designers assigned them for their runway shows and photo shoots. Frizon disliked the available shoes from other designers, and in 1969 elected to create her own and opened her first boutique in the Saint-Germain- des-Pr√©s district of Paris. That first shoe collection, with each pair hand- cut and finished, was praised by critics as sexy and unpredictable. Frizon was an immediate success. Building on the traditions of Beth Levine and foreshadowing the later designs of Manolo Blahnik, Frizon shoes were showy and extravagant, and her name joined the ranks of the haute couture boutiques. At the height of her success in the 1980s her reputation was similar to that of Blahnik today. Frizon often used expensive and everyday materials together in unusual combinations: lizard and snake, suede and satin, canvas and crocodile. Brigitte Bardot was a regular at the boutique, famous for her love of Frizon's high-heeled Russian boots. In Shoes ‚Äì Fashion and Fantasy Colin McDowell wrote \\"If shoes can be said to have a personality, none have more so than the products of Maud Frizon's imagination. [They are] original and innovative shoes that [are] to footwear what Dom Perignon is to champagne\\".Shoeshoe Although Frizon released shoes under her brands Maud Frizon and Miss Maud, she also designed footwear for Azzedine Alaia, Missoni and Sonia Rykiel among others. She is married to Luigi De Marco with whom she founded and operated her company. In 1999 Frizon and De Marco sold the company and its brands to Helene Wajnblum-Liu and her husband, who added handbags and leather accessories to the line as well as expanding the chain of Frizon boutiques.

(4 February 1683 in Saint-Malo ‚Äì 26 September 1765) was a French explorer who is credited with the discovery of Little Rock, Arkansas. He was the first known French explorer to set foot in the future state of Oklahoma. Explorations in Oklahoma In 1718, La Harpe left France, along with 40 men, and established a trading post in April 1719 on the Red River near what is now Texarkana, Texas. This was near the center of the Caddo Confederacy. La Harpe hoped to establish trade relationships with more distant and unknown Indian tribes and, thus, on Aug 11, 1718, he set off with 9 men, including 3 Caddo guides, and 22 horses loaded with trade goods to visit a Wichita village to the northwest.\\"La Harpe, Jean Baptiste Benard de\\" Handbook of Texas Online. http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fla01, accessed 20 Dec 2012 (This same year, another French explorer, Claude Charles Du Tisne also journeyed west to visit a different Wichita village in Kansas.) La Harpe followed the Red River upstream, probably to the vicinity of present-day Idabel, Oklahoma. He then turned north to cross the rugged east‚Äìwest ridges of the Ouachita Mountains which rise more than above the intervening valleys. While in the mountains, La Harpe encountered an Osage war party and narrowly avoided a fight. He also found evidence that a \\"Cancey\\" (Apache) war party was in the area.Lewis, Anna. \\"La Harpe's First Expedition in Oklahoma, 1718-1719.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma. Vol. 2, No. 4, December 1924, p. 335-340 On September 3, after 23 days of traveling, La Harpe and his party reached a large settlement. Opinions differ as to its location, but after a dig at the Lasley Vore Site in 1988, University of Tulsa anthropologist George H. Odell claimed that archaeological evidence points to it being located about 13 miles (21 km) south of Tulsa, Oklahoma near the western bank of the Arkansas River.Odell, George H. La Harpe's Post. Tuscaloosa: U of AL Press, 2002, pp. 38-40 The settlement La Harpe visited consisted of several villages overlooking the river. He estimated the population to be 6 or 7 thousand people of whom the majority were Tawakoni. Other Wichita sub-tribes, especially the Taovaya were also present. The presence of various Wichita tribes suggests that the village was a melting pot and probably a trade center for the entire region. The Wichita gave La Harpe a friendly reception, so friendly that two Black slaves in his group wanted to stay with the Indians rather than return with La Harpe. La Harpe noted that the Wichita had horses, were excellent farmers, and that game in the area was abundant. The Wichita told him they were cannibals. While in the Wichita village, a Chickasaw trader visited. This was disturbing to La Harpe, as the Chickasaw, who lived in Mississippi, were allies of the British.Lewis, pp.342-347 La Harpe left to return to his starting point on Sept 13, 1719 and arrived on October 13. En route, an Indian man and woman traveling with him were killed by Apaches and La Harpe became lost in the mountains and had to eat his horses.Lewis, pp. 348-349 The importance of La Harpe's exploration is that it was one of the two first-known French contacts with the Wichita and Apache Indians and the first known French expedition to set foot in the future state of Oklahoma. La Harpe's account of the expedition includes much information about the land he traversed and the Indians he met. The Wichita were probably grouped in such a large village as a defense from slave raids by the Osage and Apache. Within two or three decades the Wichita had moved south to the Red River where they became allies with the Comanche. Explorations in Texas Map of La Harpe's exploration of the Mid-South. In 1721, La Harpe created the earliest known map of Galveston Island and Galveston Bay at a time when he was unsuccessfully trying to establish a French presence in the area. That map or a copy of it is now in the possession of the Rosenberg Library in Galveston. In la Harpe's map, Galveston Island is not given a name but is easily identifiable.McComb David G. Galveston: A History. University of Texas Press, p5, p7. According to the Handbook of Texas Online, la Harpe's ship, Subtile, had been destined for Matagorda, winding up in Galveston Bay only by mistake.^ \\"Bellisle, Francois Simars de\\". Handbook of Texas Online. http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbe42. Retrieved on June 4, 2009. This early citing of (or even potentially landing on) Galveston Island is rarely mentioned in history books, in sharp contrast with other early well-accepted (Cabeza de Vaca) or even potential (La Salle) contacts between Europeans and Galveston Island. Explorations in Arkansas In 1722, La Harpe ascended the Arkansas River and found two distinct rock formations on the Arkansas River, the smaller one the South bank he named Le petit rocher and the larger on the North bank le rocher francais. He based a trading post near the smaller formation, as a Quapaw Indian settlement was stationed there. He explored the Arkansas River another 25 leagues (70 miles or 115 km) above Little Rock. He may have been the first explorer to discover Natural Steps, Arkansas. At the time, this area was occupied by a large Quapaw village. Later in 1722, he presided over the transfer of Pensacola, Florida to the Spanish. In 1723 he returned to France and never came back to the Americas.Encyclopedia of Arkansas HIstory & Culture. http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry- detail.aspx?entryID=2209&, accessed 20 Dec 2011 References 1683 births 1765 deaths French explorers French explorers of North America People from Saint-Malo City founders History of Little Rock, Arkansas Pre-statehood history of Oklahoma ","title":"Jean-Baptiste B√©nard de la Harpe"},{"id":"6441905","title":"Vega in fiction"},{"id":"6441912","text":"Marie Louise von Motesiczky, 1988 Marie-Louise von Motesiczky (October 24, 1906 - June 10, 1996) was an Austrian painter.  Life and work  She was born in Vienna in 1906 to an aristocratic family. Her father Edmund von Motesiczky was a talented cellist and keen huntsman. Her mother, Henriette von Lieben, came from one of the most wealthy and cultured families in the Habsburg Empire. They had donated many of the artworks in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, and, in their palatial salon opposite the opera, Hugo von Hofmannsthal had read his first poems. Their own art collection at the family's country estate in Hinterbr√ºhl was formidable. After leaving school aged only 13, Marie attended art schools in various locations around Europe, including Vienna, Paris (at the Montparnasse Painting Academy) and Berlin. In 1928, Max Beckmann invited her to join his masterclass at the St√§delschule in Frankfurt am Main, where she honed her craft and the two became lifelong friends. Motesiczky spent the next 10 years developing her craft but, as her family was partly of Jewish descent, she had to flee the Nazi annexation of Vienna in 1938. Motesiczky, accompanied by her mother Henriette, fled to London via Amsterdam where she joined the Artists' International Association and contributed to some of their exhibitions; her first solo exhibition followed in London in 1944. Her brother, who stayed behind, was killed by the Nazis for opposing the regime. During this period she also became romantically involved with the writer Elias Canetti, who was to remain a close companion and friend for many years to come. The second great influence on her work after Max Beckmann was Oskar Kokoschka. Her large circle of friends also included the sculptor Marie Duras, the art historian Sir Ernst Gombrich and the artist Milein Cosmann. Following the end of the war, Motesiczky exhibited her paintings in many European institutions and she continued to work from her house in London, where she lived only with her mother and a single maid. She had grown to love London. Her mother became the subject of many of her paintings after 1960, with Motesiczky chronicling her encroaching frailty in paintings such as The Old Song and From Night into Day. Motesiczky also painted many figurative ‚Äòfantasy paintings‚Äô, dream-like paintings which blurred fantasy and reality but which alluded to her own experience and were loaded with personal symbolism. Motesiczky's major breakthrough in the UK occurred in 1985, with a major retrospective at the Goethe Institute in London, which generated much acclaim and saw her reputation as a major Austrian artist cemented. However, on the subject of exhibiting, as The Independent wrote, \\"Motesiczky never needed to sell her paintings, indeed she preferred to keep them around her. An aristocratic disdain for the marketplace meant that, while she half welcomed exhibitions, they remained uncomfortable experiences.\\"Obituary: Marie-Louise von Motesiczky Saturday, 15 June 1996, Peter Black Apart from several works in well-known public collections, including the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Stedelijk Museum of Modern Art, the Tate Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery (London), the Fitzwilliam Museum, the √ñsterreichische Galerie im Belvedere and numerous private collections, she kept the main body of her work in her own house. She died in London in 1996. Her paintings, drawings and personal papers passed into the possession of the Marie-Louise von Motesiczky Charitable Trust under the founding Chairmanship of Jeremy Adler which has devoted itself to preserving, cataloguing, and promoting her work. Of her life in art, she once remarked ‚ÄúIf you could only paint a single good picture in your lifetime, your life would be worthwhile.‚Äù Diana Athill wrote about her friendship with Motesiczky in her autobiography 'Somewhere Towards the End' (Granta, 2008).

The brigade was initially part of the 1st Airborne Division, but remained in Britain when that division was sent overseas, and became part of the 6th Airborne Division, alongside 5th Parachute Brigade and 6th Airlanding Brigade. The brigade first went into action on 5 June 1944 during Operation Tonga, part of the Normandy landings. The objective was to destroy the Merville Gun Battery and the bridges over the River Dives. The brigade achieved all its objectives, and remained defending the left flank of the invasion zone until mid August. They then crossed the River Dives and advanced as far as the River Seine before they were withdrawn. While recovering in England, the brigade was moved to Belgium in December 1944, to counter the German attack in the Ardennes. The brigade remained on the border between Belgium and the Netherlands carrying out patrols until March 1945. Their next airborne mission was Operation Varsity, the assault crossing of the River Rhine in Germany. After this, the brigade advanced towards the Baltic Sea, arriving just ahead of the Red Army. Still part of the 6th Airborne Division, the brigade was sent to the British mandate of Palestine in October 1945 after the end of the war. Carrying out an internal security role with the rest of 6th Airborne Division, it remained in Palestine until it was disbanded in 1947\\\\. Background Impressed by the success of German airborne operations during the Battle of France, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office to investigate the possibility of creating a force of 5,000 parachute troops.Otway, p. 21 As a result, on 22 June 1940, No. 2 Commando assumed parachute duties, and on 21 November was re-designated the 11th Special Air Service Battalion, with a parachute and glider wing.Shortt and McBride, p. 4Moreman, p. 91 On 21 June 1940 the Central Landing Establishment was formed at Ringway airfield near Manchester. Although tasked primarily with training parachute troops, it was also directed to investigate the use of gliders to transport troops into battle.Otway, pp. 28‚Äì29Smith, p. 7 At the same time, the Ministry of Aircraft Production contracted General Aircraft Ltd to design and produce a glider for this purpose.Flint, p. 73 The result was the General Aircraft Hotspur, an aircraft capable of transporting eight soldiers, that was used for both assault and training purposes.Lynch, p. 31 The success of the first British airborne raid, Operation Colossus, prompted the War Office to expand the airborne force through the creation of the Parachute Regiment, and to develop plans to convert several infantry battalions into parachute and glider battalions.Harclerode, p. 218 On 31 May 1941, a joint army and air force memorandum was approved by the Chiefs-of-Staff and Winston Churchill; it recommended that the British airborne forces should consist of two parachute brigades, one based in England and the other in the Middle East, and that a glider force of 10,000 men should be created.Tugwell, p. 123 Formation The 3rd Parachute Brigade was raised on 7 November 1942, under the command of Brigadier Sir Alexander Stanier. Stanier was soon replaced by Brigadier Gerald Lathbury, who in turn was replaced in May 1943 by Brigadier James Hill, previously of the 1st Parachute Brigade.Ferguson, p. 16 Hill remained in command through the remaining war years until July 1945, when Lathbury once again assumed command. The last commander of the brigade was Brigadier Francis Rome, who took over on 15 November 1946.Wilson, p. 86 Parachute troops during Exercise Mush, April 1944 The brigade was initially composed of the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion, the 8th (Midlands) Parachute Battalion and the 9th (Eastern and Home Counties) Parachute Battalion.Horn and Wyczynski, p. 270 On 11 August 1943 the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion arrived in England and was assigned to the brigade, and the 7th Battalion was transferred to the 5th Parachute Brigade which was in the process of forming.Gregory, p. 53 At the end of the Second World War, the 1st Canadian Battalion returned to Canada, and was replaced in the brigade by the 3rd Parachute Battalion, which had previously been part of the 1st Parachute Brigade. The brigade's other units were the 3rd Airlanding Anti-Tank Battery from the Royal Artillery, the 3rd Parachute Squadron of the Royal Engineers and the 224th (Parachute) Field Ambulance from the Royal Army Medical Corps.Horn and Wyczynski, p. 323 During operations the artillery support available to the brigade would also include a battery of howitzers from the 53rd (Worcester Yeomanry) Airlanding Light Regiment, although it was not part of the brigade.Guard, p. 37 On formation the brigade was assigned to the 1st Airborne Division, and as such had to supply reinforcements to make the 1st Parachute Brigade up to strength before they left to take part in Operation Torch.Harclerode, pp. 222‚Äì223 When the 1st Airborne Division left England for operations in the Mediterranean, the 3rd Parachute Brigade remained behind, and was assigned as the first unit of the newly raised 6th Airborne Division.Harclerode, p. 223 The brigade would remain part of the 6th Airborne Division until 1947, when it was disbanded. Operational history From June to December 1943, the brigade prepared for operations as part of the 6th Airborne Division, training at every level from section up to division by day and night.Harclerode, p. 225 Airborne soldiers were expected to fight against superior numbers of the enemy, who would be equipped with artillery and tanks. Training was therefore designed to encourage a spirit of self-discipline, self-reliance and aggressiveness, with emphasis given to physical fitness, marksmanship and fieldcraft.Guard, p. 225 A large part of the training consisted of assault courses and route marching. Military exercises included capturing and holding airborne bridgeheads, road or rail bridges and coastal fortifications. At the end of most exercises, the troops would march back to their barracks, usually a distance of around . An ability to cover long distances at speed was expected; airborne platoons were required to cover a distance of in 24 hours, and battalions . General Sir Bernard Montgomery greets RSM A. Parsons of the 8th (Midlands) Parachute Battalion during an inspection of the 6th Airborne Division at Bulford, Wiltshire, 8 March 1944. In April 1944, under the command of 1st Airborne Corps, the brigade took part in Exercise Mush, in the counties of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire. This was an airborne military exercise spread over three days involving the 1st and 6th Airborne Divisions. Unknown to the 6th Airborne, it was a full-scale rehearsal for the division's involvement in the imminent Normandy invasion.Gregory, p. 100 In the invasion, the division's two parachute brigades would land just after midnight on 6 June, while the 6th Airlanding Brigade arrived later in the day just before dark. The division's objective was to secure the left flank of the invasion area by dominating the high ground in the area between the rivers Orne and Dives.Saunders, p. 143Gregory, p. 101 For their part in the operation, the 3rd Parachute Brigade had to destroy the Merville Gun Battery, whose guns were in range of the Sword Beach landings, and to demolish bridges across the River Dives to hamper the arrival of German reinforcements from the east. D-Day Just after midnight on 6 June 1944, Albermarle aircraft arrived, carrying the brigade's pathfinders, a company from the 1st Canadian Battalion to clear the drop zone (DZ) of obstructions, a group from each battalion, and brigade headquarters.Harclerode, p. 317 Some planes got lost and failed to reach the DZ or arrived late. Others were damaged before dropping all their paratroops and turned back, and one returned to base after failing to find the drop zone at all. From around 00:50 the rest of the brigade arrived in Normandy after crossing the English Channel, transported in 108 C-47 Dakotas, along with 17 Horsa gliders carrying their heavy equipment. The 8th Parachute Battalion, landing on DZ-K along with the brigade headquarters, was tasked with destroying the bridges over the River Dives at Bures and Troarn. The 1st Canadian Battalion, landing on DZ-V, was required to destroy the bridges at Varaville and Robehomme. The 9th Battalion, also landing on DZ-V, had arguably the hardest task; neutralising the Merville Gun Battery.Harclerode, pp. 306‚Äì309 Due to a combination of poor navigation, heavy cloud cover, and several of the drop zones not being marked correctly, the parachute drop was widely scattered. One group of paratroops landed away, and another landed on the wrong side of the River Orne, only from the invasion beaches. Less than half of each battalion gathered at their individual assembly areas.Otway, p. 180 In the south, at DZ-K, only 141 men of the 8th Parachute Battalion had assembled.Harclerode, p. 321 Divided into two groups, they headed for their objectives. One group demolished the two bridges at Bures without opposition. The other group, while on their way to Troarn, intercepted and ambushed a convoy of six armoured vehicles belonging to the 21st Panzer Division.Harclerode, p. 322 When they reached Troarn, they discovered it was defended by the Germans. A platoon, including engineers, managed to fight their way to the bridge. They found that it had already been damaged, so the engineers planted their explosives and enlarged the gap to around . The 1st Canadian Battalion successfully destroyed the bridges at Varaville and Robehomme after landing on the northern DZ. They then withdrew to defend Le Mesnil, where the brigade headquarters and the field ambulance were located.Harclerode, pp. 322‚Äì324 Meanwhile, by 02:50 only 150 men of the 9th Parachute Battalion had gathered at their assembly area, with virtually no heavy weapons or supplies. Unable to wait any longer, they headed for the Merville Gun Battery. The battalion captured the battery, but without explosives, could only damage two of its four guns. The battle had been costly, and only 85 men were left to head for their secondary objective, the village of Le Plein. The village was defended in strength by the Germans, and the weakened battalion could only dig in and wait the arrival of commandos from the 1st Special Service Brigade later that day.Harclerode, p. 320 By nightfall the brigade was deployed facing east, along the ridge of high ground from Le Plein in the north to the Bois de Bavent in the south.Harclerode, p. 327 Orne bridgehead On 7 June 9 Parachute Battalion, relieved by the Special Service Brigade commandos, moved southwards to the Bois de Mont near Br√©ville, shortening the front held by the 3rd Parachute Brigade. The 6th Airborne Division's deployments now had the 6th Airlanding Brigade in the south, holding a line between Longueval and Herourvillette, the 5th Parachute Brigade to the rear just to the east of the River Orne bridge, the attached 1st Special Service Brigade to the north with troops in Sallenelles and Franceville-Plage, and finally the 3rd Parachute Brigade holding the ridge of high ground to the east.Saunders, pp. 175‚Äì176 The Germans still held the village of Br√©ville, between the 3rd Parachute and 1st Special Service Brigades, which gave them a vantage point to observe the airborne division's positions. On 8 June the Germans launched a two pronged attack from Br√©ville, against the commandos and against the 9th Parachute Battalion.Saunders, p. 176 The German force, comprising elements of the 857th Grenadier Regiment, 346th Infantry Division, were only driven back by a counterattack led by the 9th Parachute Battalion's Regimental Sergeant Major.Harclerode, p. 328 The next morning the 9th Parachute Battalion was the target for a heavy mortar bombardment, followed by two further infantry attacks. Later the same morning, the 3rd Parachute Brigade's headquarters was attacked by German troops who had infiltrated the lines. The brigade defence platoon managed to hold out until a counterattack by the 9th Parachute Battalion cleared the enemy away.Harclerode, pp. 328‚Äì329 On 10 June, 31 men who had landed in the wrong locations joined the battalion, bringing their numbers up to 270 all ranks. The fighting was now concentrated around the Ch√¢teau Saint Come, which was occupied by a German infantry company supported by two self propelled guns. One of the self-propelled guns was blown up by Vickers machine gun fire,Harclerode, pp. 329‚Äì330 but the Germans then mounted a determined infantry assault, and the battalion had to call for support from HMS Arethusa. The leading German troops were undaunted by the naval bombardment, and reached the battalion's lines before they were stopped. One of the German prisoners was a battalion commander, who informed his captors that the 875th Grenadier Regiment had been virtually destroyed in the previous day's fighting. That evening the 9th Parachute Battalion captured the Ch√¢teau Saint Come, and was involved in skirmishes throughout the night.Harclerode, p. 330 The following day, 11 June, the 5th Battalion Black Watch was attached to the brigade to assist in their attempt to capture Br√©ville, but their attacks were repulsed by the Germans with heavy losses. They tried again on the 12th, and the German response was an attack by infantry supported by armour, which not only drove the Black Watch back, but almost overran the 9th Parachute Battalion's position. The situation was only saved by a counterattack by 'A' Company 1st Canadian Battalion under the command of Brigadier Hill.Saunders, pp. 182‚Äì183 Amfreville, near the hotly contested village of Breville During this time the 8th Battalion, located in the thick forest of the Bois de Bavant, were under an almost constant mortar bombardment. Not being directly attacked, the battalion concentrated on night time patrols to harass the Germans, some going as far as the German occupied villages of Troan and Bures. On 7 June 1 Canadian Parachute Battalion at Le Mesnil was attacked by units from the 857th and 858th Grenadier Regiments, supported by tanks and self-propelled guns. The battalion inflicted heavy casualties on the Germans, but only managed to drive them back with a bayonet charge by 'B' Company.Harclerode, pp. 332‚Äì333 The next day the battalion was involved in several small battles, and on 9 June sent a reconnaissance patrol to check if the Germans were still occupying Bavent. The patrol was driven back by a strong German force, but that night another patrol entered the village and planted explosive charges on weapons and in buildings.Harclerode, p. 333 Attacks by German infantry and armour continued until the night of the 12/13 June, when Br√©ville was finally captured by the division's only reserves, a mixed force from the 12th Parachute Battalion and 12th Devonshire Battalion supported by a troop of tanks from the 13th/18th Royal Hussars.Harclerode, pp. 344‚Äì346 On 13 June the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division crossed the River Orne from the west, and took over responsibility for the southern sector of the Orne bridgehead. At the same time the 4th Special Service Brigade was attached to the 6th Airborne Division, which gave them the ability to rotate one brigade at a time out of the front line to allow them to rest.Harclerode, p. 347 The 3rd Parachute Brigade, having suffered more casualties than the division's other brigades, was the first formation relieved.Harclerode, p. 348 Advance to the Seine With the capture of Breville the division was not attacked in force again, apart from an almost continuous artillery bombardment between 18 and 20 June.Cole, p. 93 Further reinforcements arrived east of the River Orne on 20 July; the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division moved into the line between the 6th Airborne and the Highland Division. Then on 7 August, the 6th Airborne Division was ordered to prepare to move over to the offensive, with its objective being the mouth of the River Seine.Otway, pp. 187‚Äì188 The three divisions east of the Orne now became I Corps, and when issuing his orders Lieutenant General John Crocker, aware that the 6th Airborne had almost no artillery, vehicles or engineer equipment, did not expect them to advance very quickly. To reach the Seine the division would have to cross three major rivers, and there were only two main lines of advance; one road running along the coast and another further inland from Troarn to Pont Audemer.Saunders, p. 196 On 17 August the Germans started to withdraw northwards.Cole, p. 98 The divisional commander had already decided that the 3rd Parachute Brigade would lead the advance along the interior road. Their objective was to capture Bures, cross the River Dives and secure the area between there and Dozul√©. At 03:00 the brigade attacked the retreating Germans. By 08:00 the 8th and 9th Battalions had captured Bures, and the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion moved through the Bois de Bavant.Saunders, p. 197 The bridges in Bures had been blown up previously, and it took the brigade's engineers until the afternoon to build a crossing. By 21:00 the brigade had crossed the Dives and halted with the 8th Parachute Battalion out in front at Goustranville. The 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was behind them, and the 9th Parachute Battalion in reserve.Saunders, p. 198 The next day the brigade met heavy resistance just beyond Goustranville, on the Dives Canal and at Dozul√© train station. The 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion had taken over the advance and were ordered to seize four bridges crossing the canal. The assault began at 22:00; at 22:35 the railway bridge in the north had been captured, and by midnight all four bridges were secured with 150 prisoners taken. The 9th Parachute Battalion then passed through the Canadians and crossed the next water obstacle without boats, as they found the water was only deep. At 01:00 on 19 August they reached Dozul√©. It was not until 07:00 on 21 August that the advance restarted, with the objective of Pont-l'Ev√™que on the River Touques.Harclerode, p. 356 After a hard battle the 8th Parachute Battalion captured Annebault, and the 5th Parachute Brigade then took over as the division's lead unit.Saunders, p. 202 On 24 August the 3rd Parachute Brigade and 4th Special Service Brigade captured Beuzeville, and the 5th Parachute Brigade reached Pont Audemer, which was the division's last objective.Saunders, p. 204 On 27 August the division was ordered to concentrate in the area between Honfleur and Pont Audemer and prepare to return to England.Harclerode, p. 363 In nine days of fighting the 6th Airborne Division had advanced ,Otway, p. 191 despite, as the divisional commander Major-General Richard Gale put it, his infantry units being \\"quite inadequately equipped for a rapid pursuit\\".Gale, p. 126. They had captured of territory and taken over 1,000 German prisoners. Since landing on 6 June, the division's casualties were 4,457, of which 821 were killed, 2,709 wounded and 927 missing. The 3rd Parachute Brigade had 207 killed.Hagerman, p. 164 The division was withdrawn from France and embarked for England at the beginning of September. Ardennes Two airborne soldiers man their wireless trench in the Netherlands. In England the brigade went into a period of recruitment and training, concentrating on house-to-house street fighting in the bombed areas of Southampton and Birmingham. The training programme culminated in Exercise Eve, an assault on the River Thames, which was intended to simulate the River Rhine in Germany.Saunders, p. 279 By December the brigade was preparing for Christmas leave, when news of the German offensive in the Ardennes broke. As part of the First Allied Airborne Army, 6th Airborne Division was available as a component of the strategic reserve for the Allied forces in northwest Europe. The other two divisions available in reserve, the American 82nd and 101st Airborne, were already at Rheims in northern France, and the 6th Airborne was sent by sea to Belgium to assist the defence.Hastings, p. 239 With 29 German and 33 Allied divisions involved, the Battle of the Bulge was the largest single battle on the Western Front during the war.Gregory, p. 118 On Christmas Day the division moved up to take position in front of the spearhead of the German advance; by Boxing Day they had reached their allocated places in the defensive line between Dinant and Namur. The 3rd Parachute Brigade were on the left, 5th Parachute Brigade on the right, and the 6th Airlanding Brigade in reserve.Harclerode, p. 549 Over the next days the German advance was halted and forced back, until at the end of January 1945, the brigade crossed into the Netherlands. Here the division was made responsible for the area along the River Maas, between Venlo and Roermond. The brigade carried out patrols, on both sides of the river, against their opponents from the German 7th Parachute Division. Near the end of February the division returned to England to prepare for another airborne mission, to cross the River Rhine into Germany.Saunders, p. 283 Germany Whereas all other Allied airborne landings had been a surprise for the Germans, the Rhine crossing was expected, and their defences were reinforced in anticipation. The airborne operation was preceded by a two-day round-the- clock bombing mission by the Allied air forces. Then on 23 March, 3,500 artillery guns targeted the German positions. At dusk Operation Plunder, an assault river crossing of the Rhine by the 21st Army Group, began.Gregory, p. 85 For their part in Operation Varsity, the 6th Airborne Division was assigned to the American XVIII Airborne Corps alongside the United States 17th Airborne Division.Harclerode, p. 551 Paratroopers marching through Hamminkeln in Germany, 25 March 1945 In the British sector the 3rd Parachute Brigade would be the first unit to arrive in Germany.Saunders, p. 288 Their initial objective was to secure the western edge of the Schneppenberg woods.Saunders, p. 284 Brigade headquarters was fully aware of the expected opposition to the landings, and the commander of the 224th (Parachute) Field Ambulance was warned to prepare for around 600 casualties; almost a third of the brigade's manpower.Cole, p. 159 On 24 March 1945 at 07:00 the 122 C-47 Dakotas transporting the brigade took off from England in three waves.Saunders, p. 285 The first wave carried brigade headquarters and the 8th Parachute Battalion, the second carried the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion, and the 9th Parachute Battalion came last.Cole, p. 160 The gliders carrying the brigade's heavy equipment were scheduled to arrive 40 minutes after the third wave.Cole, p. 161 Nine minutes ahead of schedule, the brigade started landing at their DZs. Their premature arrival stopped the Allied artillery and fighter bombers which were engaging targets in the area, especially anti-aircraft gun emplacements. The descending parachutists were met with heavy fire from the German defenders, causing several casualties. One of the dead was the commanding officer of the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion. It was during the landing that one of the Canadian medics, Corporal Frederick Topham, won a Victoria Cross, becoming the division's only recipient of the award during the war. By 11:00 the 8th Parachute Battalion had secured the DZ, and the other two battalions headed for the Schneppenberg woods, which were secured by 14:00. The 9th Parachute Battalion dug in within the woods, and the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion on the outskirts.Saunders, p. 289 At 15:00 the first troops of the Royal Scots arrived after completing their assault crossing of the Rhine. The day's fighting had cost the brigade 80 dead and 190 wounded, however they had taken around 700 prisoners. On 27 March the division started advancing further into Germany.Saunders, p. 291 The 8th Parachute Battalion was the first to reach Lembeck, which was defended by two Panzer Grenadier companies. A hand-to-hand battle ensued, lasting 18 hours and eventually drawing in all three battalions; by midnight the town was secured, with around 300 prisoners taken.Saunders, pp. 294‚Äì295 The brigade's next objective was Greven and the bridge across the River Ems. At 21:30 the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion were about away from the town. Leaving what vehicles they had behind, they attempted to approach the bridge unseen on foot, and by 23:00 had successfully secured the town and bridge. The 9th Parachute Battalion was called forward to continue the advance, but just as they approached the bridge it was blown up by the Germans. In the early hours of the morning, a footbridge across the river was discovered, and the 9th Battalion prepared to carry out an assault.Saunders, p. 296 'A' Company crossed the footbridge under fire just before dawn, and after a short fight had secured the crossing. After a few hours' rest the advance continued with the 8th Battalion in the lead, and by nightfall they had reached their next objective, the Dortmund‚ÄìEms Canal. Resting overnight, the battalion crossed the half-empty canal at 10:30 the next day.Saunders, p. 297 Over the next 36 hours the brigade advanced to Minden.Saunders, pp. 297‚Äì298 The 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division then took over from the 6th Airborne Division as the lead formation until 30 April when the Airborne Division once more resumed the advance, crossing the River Elbe over a bridge captured by the Scottish division.Saunders, p. 299 The division's objective was Wismar on the Baltic Sea; the two parachute brigades advanced on separate routes to Gadebusch, aware that the brigade to arrive first would continue as the division's lead formation. By this stage of the war the advance was hampered more by refugees fleeing westwards than by any organised opposition. The 3rd Parachute Brigade won the race and led the division to Wismar, arriving on 1 May only 30 minutes before the lead troops of the Soviet Red Army advancing from the east. Palestine At the end of May 1945, the division was pulled out of Germany and returned to England. It was initially intended to send them to India to form an airborne corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division.Gregory, p. 125 The division‚Äôs advance party, formed around the 5th Parachute Brigade, had already arrived in India.Wilson, p. 3 Following the Japanese surrender, all these plans changed. The post-war British Army only needed one airborne division, and the 6th Airborne was chosen to remain on strength. Reinforced by the 2nd Parachute Brigade, the division was sent to the Middle East as the Imperial Strategic Reserve.Wilson, p. 4 Parachute Regiment soldier standing guard over Jewish civilians waiting to be questioned during Operation Shark, July‚ÄìAugust 1946 The 3rd Parachute Brigade was the first unit of the Airborne Division to arrive in Palestine, disembarking at Haifa on 3 October 1945.Cole, p. 202 The brigade then moved to Gaza to acclimatise and regain their fitness after the voyage from England.Wilson, p. 5 On 21 October the brigade was deployed around the Lydda district, with responsibility for Tel Aviv and Jaffa.Wilson, p. 22 The first incident involving the brigade came on 14 November 1945, when the Jewish National Council called for a 12-hour strike, which resulted in rioting in Tel Aviv. By 18:15 the Palestine Police Force was unable to cope and sent for reinforcements from the 8th Parachute Battalion.Wilson, p. 27 The complete battalion was deployed and the riot was under control by 21:40 and a curfew imposed for the rest of the night.Wilson, p. 28 Early the following day the curfew was broken by large crowds gathering to loot and burn buildings, so the remainder of the brigade was deployed to the city under the codename Operation Bellicose. Night time curfews remained in place until 05:20 on 20 November, when all troops returned to their barracks.Wilson, p. 29 All was quiet in the brigade area until the night of 26/27 December, when police stations in Jaffa and Tel Aviv, the railway at Lydda and an armoury at Tel Aviv were attacked. The brigade again imposed a curfew around Tel Aviv. This was followed by cordon and search operations: Pintail on 29 December, Heron on 8 January, and Pigeon on 30 January.Wilson, p. 35 Over the night of 2/3 April 1946, there were several attacks on railway installations around the country.

The patrol's leading two vehicles exploded mines that had been laid on a bridge, wounding three men.Wilson, p. 44 At daylight the tracks of around 30 men were found, and a section from the 8th Parachute Battalion eventually cornered 24 armed men.

The 3rd Parachute Battalion joined with the 2nd Parachute Battalion and was renumbered the 2nd/3rd Parachute Battalion, and the brigade's other two battalions were amalgamated to become the 8th/9th Parachute Battalion. Both of these new units would serve in the 1st Parachute Brigade.Wilson, p. 152 The amalgamation of the 2nd and 3rd Parachute Battalions was completed in December, and the 8th and 9th Parachute Battalions in early January.

Retrieved 2017-04-30. Trained in icon-painting as well as having studied under the great Russian realist painter Ilya Repin, Malyavin is unusual among the Russian artists of the time for having a peasant background. It is possibly due to this that his paintings often depict peasant life, and his most famous work, Whirlwind, shows peasant women dancing. Biography Filipp Malyavin was born in the large village of Kazanka (Samara Governorate, now Totsky District, Orenburg Oblast), into a poor peasant family with many children. Even as a child, he was drawn towards art, drawing and creating clay figurines of birds and animals from the age of five. The village was visited by traveling monks, who would bring with them icons from Mount Athos, in Greece. Fascinated by the icons, Malyavin convinced his parents to allow him to go to Athos to study icon-painting. At the age of sixteen, he traveled to Greece with a monk from Athos, his journey financed by the villagers themselves. Although the monasteries at Athos were famed for their vast collections of Greek manuscripts and books, the art of icon painting was not actually practiced there. Malyavin was disappointed to learn that they only made copies of Russian icons. Having used up his money and thus unable to return to Russia, Malyavin entered the monastery as a novice, and was charged with painting icons and murals. This continued until 1891, when Malyavin met Vladimir Beklemishev, a Russian sculptor and professor at the Saint Petersburg Academy of Arts who was on a visit to Athos. Beklemishev was greatly impressed by Malyavin's work and invited him to Petersburg. In March 1892, Malyavin arrived in St. Petersburg and, with Beklemishev's help, was enrolled in the Academy of Arts. Due to the Academy reforms of 1894, Malyavin was able to choose his own teacher after completing the Academy curriculum. His options included such great artists as Vladimir Makovsky and Arkhip Kuindzhi. However, Malyavin applied for, and was accepted into, the studio of Russian realist Ilya Repin, who among others, also taught Igor Grabar, Konstantin Somov, Anna Ostroumova-Lebedeva, and Boris Kustodiev. It was here, in Repin's studio, that Malyavin began creating some of his most famous early works, including Peasant Girl Knitting a Stocking (1895), which is the first of his paintings in which he introduces his favorite color, red. Three of these early works, all depicting peasant women, were exhibited at the Moscow Art Lovers' Society Salon. Two of these were bought by Pavel Tretyakov for the Tretyakov Gallery. Malyavin also began to perfect his style of portraiture, creating another series of paintings depicting his fellow-artists from Repin's studio. Among the best of these is that of Konstantin Somov, who would later found the World of Art group. Malyavin's fame spread quickly, and it was not long before society grandees such as Baroness Wolf and Mme. Popova began coming to him to have their portraits painted. From 1895 to 1899, Malyavin painted frenetically. In 1897, he was awarded the status of Artist, but only after much debate, and for his series of portraits rather than his competition painting, Laughter, which depicted Russian women in red dresses in a green meadow. His work was too different, too bright, and it had no plot - it did not fit the contemporary art scene at the time. Thus, in 1900, Malyavin traveled to Paris, and took France by storm. French newspapers hailed him as \\"a credit to Russian painting,\\" and Laughter was awarded a gold medal and bought by the Museo d'arte moderno in Venice. His work was suddenly in demand, with the Luxembourg Museum in Paris buying Three Women. On returning to Russia, Malyavin married Natalia Novaak-Sarich, the daughter of a rich industrialist from Odessa and a private student at the Higher Art School. They settled in a village near Ryazan, and Malyavin devoted himself entirely to his art. His work began appearing in the salons of the World of Art group, and the Union of Russian Artists. Malyavin reached his peak between 1905 and 1907, during Russia's revolutionary crisis. Unlike other painters, at this time he focused on his \\"peasant\\" canvases. These paintings are unusual in terms of their use of bright colors and their large scales, which mark them more than their usually generic titles. In 1906, Malyavin painted Whirlwind, his greatest painting, and the Assembly of the Academy of Arts awarded him the rank of \\"Academician,\\" \\"in consideration of his fame in the field of art.\\" Between 1908 and 1910, Malyavin did not display any work, and the official art critics began attacking him more and more frequently. He traveled to Paris, and on his return, painted a large family portrait, which he exhibited in January 1911, at the salon of the Union of Russian Artists. The painting was a failure, and between 1911 and 1915, Malyavin exhibited only the works of the earlier period. In 1918, Malyavin moved with his family to Ryazan, where he participated in the Ryazan Commissariat for Education's propaganda of art and taught. In 1920, he went to Moscow, where he was admitted to the Kremlin and made drawings for Lenin's portrait. He also painted a portrait of Anatoly Lunacharsky, and his works were displayed in Moscow exhibitions. In fall of 1922, Malyavin traveled abroad with his family yet again, to organize a traveling exhibition of his works. The family settled in Paris, where he painted portraits on commission and where his work was exhibited in 1924. In 1933, he toured Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, England, and Sweden, exhibiting his work, and in 1935 and 1937, he exhibited his work in London, Stockholm, and Nice. Malyavin died on December 23, 1940, in Nice. He is noted for changing the portrayal of peasants in Russian painting and for his brilliant use of color.

Andrew Lang included it in The Pink Fairy Book.Andrew Lang, The Pink Fairy Book, \\"Master and Pupil\\" It is Aarne- Thompson type 325, \\"The Magician and His Pupil\\". Synopsis A boy trying to get himself hired is asked by a man if he can read who rejects him when the boy says he can even though his duties would only be to dust the man's books. The boy runs ahead of the man and asks again for a job and this time claims he cannot read. The man accepts the boy and while he dusts the books he reads them. As his master is a wizard, the boy learns some magic and is then able to transform into any animal. Later, the boy runs away and returns to his parents where he assists them by turning into a horse, being sold by his father, turning back into a boy, and escaping back to his parents. The wizard hears about this and goes to the father to buy the boy/horse. He then attempts to have a red-hot nail driven into the horse's mouth, as this will stop the transformation. The boy turns into a dove to escape but the wizard turns himself into a hawk to chase him. Then the boy transforms into a gold ring and drops into a girl's lap. The wizard attempts to purchase the ring but the girl refuses as it has fallen from heaven. The wizard continues to offer ever increasing amounts of money until the boy, in fear, transforms into a grain of barley. The wizard turns into a hen intending to eat the boy, but the grain changes into a polecat which then bites the hen's head off. The polecat then transforms back into the boy who marries the girl and does no more magic. Commentary While \\"Farmer Weathersky\\" and \\"The Thief and His Master\\" include the transformation chase of a pupil from his master, in those tales, the boy is actually a pupil, and not learning on the sly as in this one.

He called for, among other things, for the world to stop recognizing the State of Israel, just like it, according to him, had not recognized the Taliban regime in Afghanistan or the Apartheid regime in South Africa.Gaarder, Jostein. \\"\\"God's Chosen People .\\" Retrieved 2006-08-25 The name of the op-ed alludes to the concept of \\"choseness\\" in Judaism. The text was perceived by scholars such as Yehuda Bauer and Shimon Samuels of the Simon Wiesenthal Center as deeply antisemitic.Interview in Klassekampen with Yehuda Bauer Subsequently Gaarder clarified his views on Israel. Specifically, he said that he does not question Israel's right to exist, \\"but not as an apartheid state\\". Gaarder repeatedly dismissed suggestions that his article was anti-Semitic. In 2011, he wrote a new piece in Aftenposten where he regretted that he had used some thoughtless phrases that could be misinterpreted as anti-Judaistic. First op-ed The piece, titled \\"God's Chosen People\\" was written in response to the 2006 Lebanon war and claimed that Israel was \\"a state founded on anti-humanistic principles and on the ruins of an archaic national and warlike religion.\\" The op-ed, which Gaarder, in a 7 August 2006 NRK Channel 2 radio debate said was read by \\"countless people\\" and \\"Middle East experts\\" prior to publishing, was written in the literary form of a biblical prophecy, believed by some to be inspired by the Book of Amos. Gaarder maintained that the predictions in the piece do not reflect a course of events he would desire, but rather how it might turn out unless Israel changes its political course.Gaarder condemns Israel Among other things, Gaarder wrote: > We laugh at this people's whims, and cry over its misdeeds. To act as God's > chosen people is not only foolish and arrogant, it is a crime against > humanity. We call it racism. [‚Ä¶] There are limits to our patience and there > are limits to our tolerance. We do not believe in divine promises as a > rationale for occupation and apartheid. We have left the Middle Ages behind. > We laugh with embarrassment at those who still believe that the god of the > flora, fauna and galaxies has chosen one particular people as his favorite, > and given them amusing stone tablets, burning bushes and a license to kill. In the article, Gaarder contrasts the use of religious legitimization of war and occupation with humanistic values, quoting Albert Schweitzer: \\"Humanitarianism consists of never sacrificing a human being for a cause.\\" The op-ed contrasted Israel with the teachings of Jesus: > We do not recognize the old Kingdom of David as a model for the 21st century > map of the Middle East. The Jewish rabbi claimed two thousand years ago that > the Kingdom of God is not a martial restoration of the Kingdom of David; the > Kingdom of God is within us and amongst us. The Kingdom of God is compassion > and forgiveness. Furthermore, he claimed that many Israelis celebrated the death of Lebanese children, comparing this behavior to the Biblical story where the Israelites celebrated God's plagues against Egypt: > We don't believe that Israel grieves any more for the forty killed Lebanese > children than it has wailed over the forty years spent in the desert three > thousand years ago. We note that many Israelis celebrate such triumphs in > the same manner they once cheered the plagues of the Lord as \\"fitting > punishment\\" for the people of Egypt. He stated that \\"we recognize the State of Israel of 1948 but not that of 1967. It is the state of Israel that fails to recognize, respect, or defer to the internationally lawful Israeli state of 1948. Israel wants more; more water and more villages\\", adding that Israel already has ceased to exist. He finishes his op-ed by envisioning a future in which the Israelis are the refugees, but hoping that they will be shown mercy: > Peace and free passage for the evacuating, civilian population no longer > protected by a State. Shoot not at the fugitives! Take not aim at them! They > are vulnerable now -- like snails without shells, vulnerable as slow > caravans of the Palestinian and Lebanese refugees, defenseless as the women, > children and elderly of Qana, Gaza, Sabra and Shatilla. Give the Israeli > refugees shelter; give them milk and honey! Let not one Israeli child pay > with his life. Far too many children and civilians have already been > murdered. The op-ed was published together with an interview of Gaarder where he explained the thoughts behind the op-ed. When asked about what he wanted to achieve, he answered that he actually wrote it as a wake-up call to Israel. The state of Israel, he says, is the one state not respecting Israel as it was originally \\"created by the United Nations.\\" When Aftenposten asked him if he went too far by not recognizing Israel, he answered: > The op-ed is a judgement prophecy. Of course I don't mean that Israel has no > right to defend herself. What I say is no different from what the world > community has been saying through the UN resolutions. Again and again we see > Israel overreacting, says Gaarder, and stresses that he is not against > Israel as such, but that he distinguishes between the Israel of 1948 and the > one of 1967. Reactions Reactions to the article were mixed. Some in the Norwegian Jewish community, several Jewish organizations, and many Norwegian intellectuals criticized it as being too harsh or lopsided. Many saw it as having been written in a literary style inappropriate for a mass medium discussion of such a controversial topic. But many also expressed their support for his op-ed piece, or at least what they saw as the gist of it. Some members of the Norwegian Jewish community as well as several historians in Jewish history, and other Norwegian pundits expressed deep concern and outrage over imagery and themes reminiscent of religious anti-Semitism, in which Christianity was promoted as the humanistic, peaceful successor to Judaism.Interview with Mona Levin Gabi Gleichmann: Gaarder offends the Jews Julius Paltiel and Tor Bang: Jostein's World Bente Groth: Old prejudices, new Jew-hatred Martin Eiliv Sandbu: En skremmende fremtid The official position of the Church of Norway has long been to condemn the use of Christian themes to put Judaism in a bad light.Olav Fykse Tveit: Ikke misbruk kirkens arv Some spoke up against Gaarder for his views on Israel as well as the perceived antisemitic connotations of his article. Others expressed understanding of the sentiments behind the article, but felt the form and wording were open to different interpretations. The day after Gaarder's op-ed Simon Samuels of the Simon Wiesenthal Center published a rebuttal, \\"Open Letter to the People of Norway\\", also published in Aftenposten, where he speculated that Gaarder must be suffering from mental illness: > Jostein Gaarder, the author of the literary chef d'oeuvre, \\"Sophie's World,\\" > has become seriously ill, either with malice or, perhaps, Alzheimer's, or > both. Translated into 53 languages and with 26 million copies sold, so many > of his readers will mourn Gaarder's current loss of vision, coherence and, > above all, his recruitment to the forces of darkness. His 5 August article > in your newspaper has exposed his shallow Biblical knowledge and the > Judeophobic paranoia that haunts his nightmares. We call on the Norwegian > people to decry his message. Obsessed with the Jews as \\"God's Chosen > People,\\" Gaarder regurgitates this concept's classic antisemitic definition > as \\"arrogant and domineering.\\" Samuels finished his letter by emphasizing that Jewish sovereignty has returned and that Gaarder and those he seeks to appease will not be obliged: > Gaarder concludes: \\"Let not one Israeli child pay with his life,\\" in the > same column wherein he sets the scene for the extermination of all Israeli > children. We will not oblige Gaarder and those he seeks to appease. Jewish > sovereignty has returned to history. The wandering Jew is a figment of > history, as Gaarder and his ilk are now history. We await the word of honest > Norwegians who will vociferously condemn Gaarder because they realize that > the fate of the Jews is an alarm bell for humanity. In numerous interviews after the publication of the op-ed, Gaarder maintained that he is not an anti-Semite and that the piece was never intended as an attack on the Jewish people or on Judaism. Several members of the Norwegian Jewish community, however, said that regardless of Gaarder's intent, the article served to legitimize deep-rooted antisemitic attitudes by tying them in with a public opinion already hostile to Israel. Odd-Bj√∏rn Fure, a well- known Norwegian historian and director of the Norwegian Center for Studies of Holocaust and Religious Minorities wrote: \\"[...] Gaarder uses a language which contributes to lowering barriers in the description of Israel and Jewish culture. [...] Gaarder has crossed a line, but I don't think he realizes it\\". Three days after publishing the op-ed, Jostein Gaarder announced his intention to \\"withdraw from the debate.\\" While admitting that the style of his op-ed was \\"challenging\\" and open to different interpretations, he felt little would be served by his continued contribution. He maintained that the original piece was motivated by \\"disgust for the war, and the wrongdoing of the Israeli army\\". Gaarder also said: > \\"We have a very good word in Norwegian for what Israel is doing in Lebanon: > H√¶rverk [vandalism, or literally \\"the work of an army\\"]. And I also condemn > the rockets of Hezbollah against Israel, just to make that clear. I have > said it numerous times, and will repeat it: I'm a humanist, not an > antisemite. Both the Jewish and Greek ideas are part of the foundation of > what I believe in\\" . Jostein Gaarder's Israeli publisher, Schocken Publishing House, announced 9 August 2006, that it would stop cooperating with Gaarder and no longer publish his books. In addition, Racheli Edelman, the owner-publisher of Schocken Publishing House, is looking into whether the op-ed could form the basis of a lawsuit against Gaarder. Schocken changed its decision after Gaarder's Norwegian publisher Aschehoug contacted Schocken and expressed the view that it would be \\"a scandal if a publisher dropped an author because of a debate\\". William Nygaard, director of Aschehoug, Gaarder's publisher in Norway, who himself was a victim of an assassination attempt presumed to be a result of the fatwa issued against Salman Rushdie for publishing The Satanic Verses, expressed support for Gaarder: > \\"I think it is very important that Jostein Gaarder, as an active person in > the Norwegian public sphere and as an internationally renowned author, is > willing, in the name of free speech, to take on the burden of critically > commenting on a sensitive subject such as the conflict between Israel and > Lebanon.\\"Nettavisen: Kultur The strong attacks and accusations about anti-Semitism against Gaarder have prompted commentators to voice criticism against what they perceive as a misuse of the label \\"antisemite\\" against critics of Israel. Associate professor in Middle Eastern history Hilde Henriksen Waage at the University of Oslo commented that: \\"Any debate about the politics of the state of Israel drowns in accusations of antisemitism and racism\\" and intimated that Gaarder would not be safe in Norway after this op-ed.

The Court found that in considering equality rights, comparator groups are needed to demonstrate that one has suffered differential treatment. Courts may reject the rights claimant's view as to what an appropriate comparator group would be. Background The case began with one Betty Hodge, who was involved in a common law marriage with a man named Mr. Bickell since 1972. Due to his alleged cruelties, she terminated the relationship in 1993. After an attempt to get back together in 1994, she ended the relationship once more. Ms. Hodge later testified in court that she meant for the second break-up to be ever-lasting. Mr. Bickell died later in 1994, and had no money. Ms. Hodge then applied for the Canada Pension Plan for a survivor's pension. This application was rejected, on the grounds that Ms. Hodge was not Mr. Bickell's spouse at the time of his death. Separated married people would have received the pension, but divorcees would not. Common law marriage has been recognized as being equal to marriage under section 15 since Miron v. Trudel (1995). The rejection of Ms. Hodge's application was appealed to a Canada Pension Plan Review Tribunal in 1997. The tribunal held that the law was invalid because Ms. Hodge was denied a benefit for not living with Mr. Bickell for the full year up to his death. The Pension Appeals Board overturned this finding in 2000, noting that in requiring a year's residence, the Parliament of Canada was merely trying to avoid more than one common law spouse claiming eligibility for a survivor's pension. In turn, the Federal Court of Appeal found in favour of Hodge in 2002. The Federal Court found the rejection to be discrimination based on marital status. If Ms. Hodge had been married to Mr. Bickell before the break-up, she would have received a pension. Ms. Hodge compared herself to separated married people, and not divorcees, and the Federal Court accepted this comparison. Decision The decision by the Supreme Court was written by Justice Ian Binnie. He began by noting that since Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia (1989), comparator groups have been seen as being important to section 15 considerations. This means that a rights claimant is similar to one group, but has suffered differential treatment due to a different characteristic. This view was reaffirmed in Lovelace v. Ontario (2000). In this case, Binnie wrote that selecting the comparator group was not simply an initial step for section 15, and that each test for determining whether there has been discrimination should be done through comparisons. As questions of dignity or context are raised, the comparator group may be narrowed. Binnie felt this is what happened in the landmark section 15 case, Law v. Canada (1999).Para. 17. He went on to say that if, as section 15 tests are completed, it turns out the comparator group initially selected is not the most appropriate, a claim to section 15 may fail. Binnie referred to this situation as the \\"Achilles' heel\\" in section 15 precedent such as Granovsky v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (2000).Para. 18. Binnie wrote that section 15 should not be twisted by claimants choosing comparator groups whose situations do not match their own. Thus, courts can reject a claimant's choice regarding a comparator group. While the Federal Court of Appeal accepted the claimant's choice for a comparator group on the grounds that the claimant had evidence to back it up, Binnie, citing Granovsky and Law, replied the court can take a larger role in evaluating the correctness of the comparison.Para. 21-22. To select a comparator group, Binie wrote groups must be similar except with respect to one characteristic which is the basis of discrimination. The government objective is important to consider, though Binnie cautioned that if the government's selected recipients for a benefit was narrowed too exclusively, section 15 would not protect this benefit on the grounds that members of the recipient group are equal to one another.Para. 25-26. With this in mind, Binnie rejected Ms. Hodge's comparator group of separated married people. While there was a distinction based on marital status, Ms. Hodge's relationship with Mr. Bickell had ended, and separated married spouses were different because while they may mean to end their marriages, the marriages were not legally or officially ended. Ms. Hodge had suggested that common law marriage should be seen as lasting beyond separation, if there is still some \\"economic dependency\\" between the partners. However, Binnie responded that Parliament had selected cohabitation and not economics as the indicator for common law marriage.Para. 44. Thus, Binnie decided that Ms. Hodge's dignity should not be affected, and section 15 was not violated.Para. 47.

It opened in 1953 as the Edificio Espa√±a (), a mixed-use structure containing a hotel, offices, apartments and shops. It is an example of 20th-century Spanish architecture built in the neo-baroque style. The Spanish RIU Hotels chain acquired the building in 2017 and reopened it as a hotel in 2019. History Early history The Edificio Espa√±a in the 1950s It was designed by architect Juli√°n Otamendi and his brother in the Neo- baroque style and constructed from 1948 to 1953. It was a \\"symbol of prosperity\\" during the decades of Francisco Franco's Spain. It was the tallest building in Spain, with 25 floors and a height of , until overtaken by the Torre de Madrid (also built by Otamendi) in 1957. The building formerly housed the 360-room Hotel Plaza (later the Crowne Plaza Madrid City Centre), 300 offices, 184 apartments,http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2015/04/18/actualidad/1429384059_042026.html a shopping centre, and a rooftop pool. Its profile, on Plaza de Espa√±a at the end of the Gran V√≠a, complements the neighboring skyscraper Torre de Madrid, making the pair important architectural landmarks in the city. Metrovacesa, which owned the structure since its completion, marketed it in April 2005 along with the neighboring Torre de Madrid to help finance its acquisition of French property company, Gecina. In June 2005, Santander Real's investment fund acquired 50% of the building for ‚Ç¨138.6 million, committing to purchase the remaining 50% belonging to the hotel shortly thereafter. The Crowne Plaza Hotel occupying the building closed in 2006. The deal closed in early December 2007. Santander renovated the building, preserving intact the facade and the lobby as part of a project to build a hotel and apartments, but the project stalled in 2010. The building was acquired in 2014 by Wang Jianlin's Chinese real estate company Dalian Wanda for \\"about a third less than the ‚Ç¨389 million that Banco Santander paid in 2005, at the height of Spain‚Äôs construction boom\\". Dalian Wanda \\"plans to renovate the structure to include luxury apartments and a hotel as part of a broader overhaul of the neighborhood\\", and in January 2015 the Governing Board of the Community of Madrid approved the proposed refurbishment. Wang intends to \\"create a luxury hotel, more than 300 homes and a retail space, which he plans to expand to 15,000 sqm\\". By the time it was purchased by Dalian Wanda, it had been empty for several years and \\"had become a symbol of the Spanish real estate market‚Äôs collapse in 2008\\" that marked the beginning of the Great Recession in Spain. Wanda later sold the structure to the Baraka Group. In January 2017, it was announced that the building will be remodeled into a Riu Plaza hotel.https://www.hotelnewsresource.com/article92808.html In June 2017, RIU Hotels bought the entire structure outright from the Baraka Group. They remodeled the building to serve entirely as a hotel,https://www.hotelnewsresource.com/article94760.html the Hotel Riu Plaza Espa√±a, which opened on August 13, 2019.https://www.hotelnewsresource.com/article106614.html The lower three floors contain retail, while the rest of the building houses a 585-room hotel with 5,000m¬≤ of event space, two restaurants, and a rooftop pool and skybar.

Formed in late 1942 in the Mediterranean and Middle East, the brigade was composed of three parachute infantry units, the 10th, 11th and 156th Parachute Battalions. The brigade was assigned to the 1st Airborne Division, just prior to the Allied invasion of Sicily, but played no part in the invasion. Instead the brigade first saw action in September 1943, during Operation Slapstick, an amphibious landing at the port of Taranto, as part of the early stages of the Allied invasion of Italy. Largely unopposed, the brigade captured the ports of Brindisi and Bari before being withdrawn. By the end of the year, the 4th Parachute Brigade was in England, preparing for the Allied invasion of North- West Europe. The brigade did not see action in France, being instead placed on standby for an emergency during the Normandy landings. Between June and August 1944 the speed of the subsequent Allied advance obviated the need to deploy airborne forces. In September 1944, the brigade formed part of the second day's parachute landings at the Battle of Arnhem, part of Operation Market Garden. Problems reaching the bridges in Arnhem forced the divisional commander, Major-General Roy Urquhart, to divert one of the brigade's battalions to assist the 1st Parachute Brigade. After a short delay the brigade headed out for its objective. When only halfway there, however, the remaining two battalions were confronted by prepared German defences. The brigade, having suffered heavy losses, was eventually forced to withdraw. The next day, weakened by fighting at close quarters and now numbering around 150 men, the brigade eventually reached the divisional position at Oosterbeek. After a week of being subjected to almost constant artillery, tank and infantry attacks, the remnants of the brigade were evacuated south of the River Rhine. During the battle of Arnhem, the brigade's total casualties amounted to seventy-eight per cent, and the 4th Parachute Brigade was disbanded rather than reformed, the survivors being posted to the 1st Parachute Brigade. Formation Impressed by the successful German airborne operations, during the Battle of France, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops.Otway, p.21 On 22 June 1940, No. 2 Commando was turned over to parachute duties and, on 21 November, re-designated the 11th Special Air Service Battalion, with a parachute and glider wing.Shortt and McBride, p.4Moreman, p.91 This was later to become the 1st Parachute Battalion. It was these men who took part in the first British airborne operation, Operation Colossus, on 10 February 1941.Guard, p.218 The success of the raid prompted the War Office to expand the existing airborne force, setting up the Airborne Forces Depot and Battle School in Derbyshire, and creating the Parachute Regiment, as well as converting a number of infantry battalions into airborne battalions.Harclerode, p. 218 These battalions were assigned to the 1st Airborne Division with the 1st Parachute Brigade and the 1st Airlanding Brigade. The first General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the division, Major-General Frederick Arthur Montague \\"Boy\\" Browning, expressed his opinion that the fledgling force must not be sacrificed in \\"penny packets\\" and urged the formation of more brigades.Ferguson, pp.7‚Äì9 Men at the parachute school assault course, North Africa 1943. The 4th Parachute Brigade was formed at RAF Kibrit in the Middle East on 1 December 1942.Rosignoli, p.24 Upon formation it consisted of the brigade headquarters, signals company, defence platoon and three parachute battalions.Guard, p.37 The battalions assigned were the 156th Parachute Battalion (156 Para), raised from British servicemen in India, the 10th Parachute Battalion (10 Para), formed around a cadre from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment, and the 11th Parachute Battalion (11 Para), created from a cadre of 156 Para.Ferguson, p.9 The brigade's battalions all had the same composition: three rifle companies, each comprising a company headquarters, and three platoons. Each had a Support Company of mortar, machine gun and carrier platoons, along with a Headquarters Company.Powell, p.19 The brigade's first commander, Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Smyth, was replaced by Brigadier John Hackett on 4 January 1943. Facilities and weather conditions at Kibret proved to be unsuitable for airborne operations, so the brigade moved to RAF Ramat David in Palestine to continue their training. The brigade came to full strength in May 1943, and in June was sent to Tripoli, where it joined the 1st Airborne Division. Also assigned to the division were the 1st and 2nd Parachute Brigades and the glider infantry of the 1st Airlanding Brigade. In 1944, the brigade also had under their command 133 Parachute Field Ambulance, Royal Army Medical Corps, 2nd Airlanding Light Battery, Royal Artillery, 2nd (Oban) Airlanding Anti-Tank Battery, Royal Artillery and 4th Parachute Squadron, Royal Engineers.Urquhart, p.225 Italy In 1943, the 4th Parachute Brigade, although still part of the 1st Airborne Division, was kept out of the Allied invasion of Sicily by a shortage of transport aircraft. The 1st Airlanding Brigade took part in Operation Ladbroke and the 1st Parachute Brigade in Operation Fustian. Both brigades suffered heavy casualties, so that by the time Operation Slapstick was proposed, only the 2nd and 4th Parachute Brigades were up to strength.Ferguson, p.13 Slapstick was in part a deception operation to divert German forces from the main Allied landings and also an attempt to seize intact the Italian ports of Taranto, Bari and Brindisi.Blumenson, p.94 The lack of air transport meant that the division's two available brigades had to be transported by sea. They would cross the Mediterranean in four Royal Navy cruisers with their escorts. If the landing was successful, the British 78th Infantry Division in Sicily and the 8th Indian Infantry Division in the Middle East, under the command of British V Corps, under Lieutenant General Charles Walter Allfrey, would be sent to reinforce the landings.Blumenson, p.95 With 11 Para still in Palestine, the 4th Parachute Brigade only had 10 and 156 Para available to take part in the landings. On 9 September 1943, the same day as the Salerno landings by Lieutenant General Mark Clark's U.S. Fifth Army, the brigade landed at Taranto unopposed. Their first objective was the airfield of Gioia del Colle inland. En route to the airfield near the town of Castellaneta, 10 Para came up against a German roadblock defended by a Fallschirmj√§ger unit of the German 1st Parachute Division.Dover, p. 82 During the battalion's assault on the roadblock, Major General George Frederick Hopkinson, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 1st Airborne Division, observing the action, was hit by a burst of machine gun fire and killed.Harclerode, p. 262 At the same time, 156 Para at San Basilio, carried out a successful flank attack on Fallschirmj√§ger defending the town. Two days later, having been only involved in minor skirmishes, the brigade occupied Bari and Brindisi. By 19 September 1943 the 4th Para Brigade had reached Foggia, the northernmost point of their advance, before being ordered back to Taranto. Playing no further part in operations in Italy, the brigade was withdrawn by sea to the United Kingdom, arriving in November 1943. The 4th Parachute Brigade's casualties during the fighting in Italy amounted to 11 officers and 90 other ranks killed in action.Saunders, p.148 In December 1943, 11 Para, which had been working independently in the Mediterranean, rejoined the brigade. The only operation they had been involved in was a company sized parachute assault on the Greek island of Kos. The Italian garrison surrendered and the company was relieved by men of the 1st Battalion, Durham Light Infantry and the RAF Regiment. England Paratroopers adjust their parachute harnesses during a large-scale airborne forces exercise, 22 April 1944. In England the brigade trained for operations in North-West Europe under the supervision of the I Airborne Corps. Although they were not scheduled to take part in the Normandy landings, under Operation Tuxedo the brigade would be parachuted in to support operations if any of the five invasion beaches experienced difficulties.Urquhart, p.16Peters and Buist, p.18 Tuxedo was the only operation planned where the brigade would act as an independent formation whereas 13 other operations were prepared which would have deployed the entire 1st Airborne Division. However, the speed of the Allied advance towards the River Seine and then onwards from Paris northwards, was accomplished without airborne assistance and the plans were cancelled.Peters and Buist, pp.20‚Äì26 The brigade's next operation was scheduled for early September 1944. Codenamed Comet, the plan called for the 1st Airborne Division's three brigades to land in the Netherlands and capture three river crossings. The first of these was the bridge over the River Waal at Nijmegen, the second the bridge over the River Maas at Grave and finally the River Rhine at Arnhem.Peters and Buist, p.28 The objective of the 4th Parachute Brigade would be the bridge at Grave.Peters and Buist, p.31 Planning for Comet was well advanced when on the 10 September the mission was cancelled. Instead, a new operation, Market Garden, was proposed whose objectives were the same as those of Comet but would this time be carried out by three divisions of the 1st Allied Airborne Army.Peters and Buist, pp.40‚Äì41 Arnhem Map of the Arnhem area showing the planned drop and landing zones. Landings by the 1st Allied Airborne Army's three divisions began in the Netherlands on 17 September 1944. Although allocation of aircraft for each division was roughly similar, the U.S. 101st Airborne Division landing at Nijmegen would use only one lift. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division at Grave required two lifts while the British 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem would need three lifts. Whereas the two American divisions delivered at least three quarters of their infantry in their first lift, the 1st Airborne's similar drop used only half its infantry capacity and the remainder to deliver vehicles and artillery.Tugwell, p.241 The 1st Airborne Division had the required airlift capacity to deliver all three parachute brigades with their glider borne anti-tank weapons or two of the parachute brigades and the airlanding brigade on day one. However, instead the vast majority of the division's vehicles and heavy equipment, plus 1st Parachute Brigade, most of 1st Airlanding Brigade and divisional troops would be on the first lift. The airlanding brigade would remain at the landing grounds and defend them during the following day's lifts, while the parachute brigade set out alone to capture the bridges and ferry crossing on the River Rhine.Urquhart, pp.5‚Äì10 On the second day, 4th Parachute Brigade's lift of ninety-two C-47s (for the paratroops), forty-nine Horsa and nine Hamilcar gliders (for the artillery, vehicles and crews), were scheduled to arrive furthest away from Arnhem on Ginkel Heath drop zone 'Y', as early as possible on Monday 18 September 1944.Peters and Buist, p.59 The brigade's objective was to capture the high ground north-west of Arnhem.Peters and Buist, pp.59‚Äì60 In their last briefing before departure, Brigadier Hackett dismissed all officers except for the battalion commanders and the brigade staff and told them; > \\"They could forget what they had been told. Being put down where we were, > with surprise gone and the opposition alerted, and given the German > capability for a swift and violent response to any threat to what really > mattered, they could expect their hardest fighting and worst casualties, not > in defence of the final perimeter, but in trying to get there.\\"Ferguson, > p.27 The division's fourth unit, the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade, were to arrive on day three, dropping their glider troops in the north and their paratroops south of the river.Peters and Buist, p.60 Once all units were in place, the division was to form a defensive ring around the Arnhem bridges until relieved by the advance of XXX Corps to the south. 18 September Although the first day's landings on 17 September were successful, over the night of 17‚Äì18 September, divisional commander Major-General Roy Urquhart was reported missing so Brigadier Philip Hicks of 1st Airlanding Brigade assumed command of the division on September 18.Tugwell, p.258 Subsequent problems in Arnhem forced Hicks to change the divisional plan. Only the 2nd Parachute Battalion had reached the road bridge as strong German defences had stopped the other battalions. Hicks decided that the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment and 11 Para would link up with the 1st Parachute Brigade in an attempt to reach their objective.Urquhart, p.61Urquhart, p.76 On 18 September, day two of the operation, bad weather over England kept the second lift on the ground and the first troops did not arrive in the Netherlands until 15:00. The delay gave the Germans time to approach the northern landing grounds and engage the defenders from the 7th Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB).Urquhart, p.72 Elsewhere German attacks were only stopped by bombardments from the division's 75 mm artillery guns.Peters and Buist, p.127 The 4th Parachute Brigade's paratroops jumped from between through German machine gun fire, yet despite the enemy having encroached to within range of the drop zone, the brigade landed with only minor casualties.Peters and Buist, p.144 C-47 Dakotas and paratroops silhouetted against the sky as they descend. Once the brigade arrived, many of the Germans around the drop zone withdrew or offered no further resistance. The first unit on the ground, 10 Para, attacked and destroyed the Dutch SS Wachbattalion while Brigadier Hackett personally captured ten Germans shortly after landing.Urquhart, p.75 When Hackett arrived at brigade headquarters, he was informed by Lieutenant Colonel Mckenzie of the division's staff about the change in plans, explaining that 11 Para was to be detached from his brigade to support the push into Arnhem. At the same time the KOSB, until then responsible for defending the northern side of the landing grounds, were attached to 4th Parachute Brigade to replace 11 Para. Meanwhile, the KOSB still had to defend landing-zone 'L', to protect gliders arriving on day three.Urquhart, p.60 While Hackett formulated a new plan, Mckenzie returned to divisional headquarters, to be informed on his arrival that 60 German tanks were approaching Arnhem from the north. Transport aircraft passing over occupied channel ports had confirmed German suspicions of a second lift such that they were able to give their troops at Arnhem forty-five minutes advance notice of the allies' arrival. Prepared in advance for such an eventuality, a Waffen SS mobile unit had been dispatched towards the likely landing grounds.Urquhart, p.73 Hackett decided the brigade would advance between the railway line and the Ede‚ÄìArnhem road, in order to capture their three objectives, first the high ground overlooking Johanna Hoeve farm, next the woods near to Lichtenbeek House and finally the high ground at Koepel.Peters and Buist, p.169 The delay in England meant it was 17:00 before the brigade started moving.Powell, p.60 With the element of surprise gone and no intelligence on the German dispositions, 156 Para headed for the first objective. Followed by 10 Para slightly behind and to their left.Urquhart, p.79 Bringing up the rear was the brigade reserve 4th Field Squadron, Royal Engineers, acting in an infantry role.Peters and Buist, p.168 Three hours later 156 Para had covered about ,Powell, p.65 and as darkness fell they came up against a strong German defensive position which they were unable to outflank in the dark. The battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel des Voeux, out of contact with brigade headquarters, decided to stay where they were for the night and continue the advance in daylight.Powell, pp.74‚Äì84 19 September Early the next day an attack by German 88 mm guns destroyed some of 10 Para's transport. The battalion counterattacked, capturing the guns and a nearby farm building they were using. The brigade advance restarted at 07:00, but by now the 9th SS Panzer Division had established a blocking position between Oosterbeek and the Ede‚ÄìArnhem road across the brigade's expected route. Repeated assaults by both battalions could not find a way through.Peters and Buist, p.173 Advancing through heavy woodland, 156 Para were confronted by infantry supported by mortars, self propelled guns (SP gun) as well as fighter aircraft, and the battalion suffered heavy losses. At one stage 'A' Company penetrated the German line, but before they could dig in, all their officers were killed or wounded. Short of ammunition, the remaining men were counter-attacked by the Germans and driven back.Powell, p.120 Brigade headquarters jeeps and signallers. In Arnhem at around 03:30, the leading units of 11 Para reached 1st Parachute Brigade and the 2nd South Staffords, just as they started a new attempt to fight through to the bridge. As the battalion had just arrived and had no appreciation of the ground, it was held in reserve and played no part in the attack. By dawn and under intense fire, the attack faltered and 11 Para were ordered to carry out a left flanking attack to relieve the pressure on the South Staffords. Only the intervention of Major-General Urquhart, just freed from where he had been trapped, stopped the 11 Para assault. Having recognised the futility of the battle Urquhart was not prepared to reinforce failure.Peters and Buist, p.164 At 11:00 the Major- General ordered 11 Para still in the outskirts of Arnhem to support the advance of 4th Parachute Brigade by occupying the high ground on the north- west outskirts of Arnhem. At 14:30 the battalion was caught in the open and subjected to a mortar attack. The attacked caused heavy casualties including the commanding officer lieutenant-Colonel George Lea, unable to proceed around 150 of the survivors were forced to withdraw towards Oosterbeek.Badsey, p.56 By 14:00 the 4th Parachute Brigade was no further forward. With casualties mounting, Brigadier Hackett asked General Urquhart's permission to withdraw south of the railway line. His intention was to move through Wolfheze and into Oosterbeek where the division's support units waited. The change of direction was further complicated by the lack of vehicle crossings along the railway line‚Äîthere were only two, one at Wolfheze and the other at Oosterbeek.Peters and Buist, p.174 Both battalions were still in contact with the Germans during the withdrawal with 10 Para to the north having the furthest to travel to reach the relative safety of the rail crossing. By 15:00 it became obvious that the Germans were already in front of the battalion. Now, as well as fighting a rearguard action, they had to capture positions between themselves and the railway line. Captain Lionel Queripel of 10 Para was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross, the highest British military decoration, for his actions while in command of the battalion's rear guard. As both battalions headed for the railway line, gliders carrying the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade's vehicles and artillery arrived at landing zone 'L'. The KOSB still defending the area were holding out against repeated German attacks but the landing ground was in range of the Germans guns. At the same time 10 Para, closely followed by German armoured vehicles and under mortar fire, reached the clearing. The leading companies had just cleared the woods and started across open ground when the gliders arrived. In the confusion, with both groups under fire, each thought the other was the enemy and began shooting back.Peters and Buist, pp.183‚Äì184 The Polish anti-tank battery was virtually destroyed and although some vehicles got away the majority of their guns were trapped in the burning gliders.Powell, p.140 Some of the pursuing German troops tried to cross the landing zone only to suffer heavy casualties at the hands of the defending KOSB companies.Peters and Buist, p.184 In the confusion, 'A' Company KOSB, covering the withdrawal of 10 Para, was cut off and eventually forced to surrender.Peters and Buist, p.185 The buildup of vehicles and men trying to use the crossing at Wolfheze caused a bottleneck and made progress slow. Rather than wait, brigade headquarters, the KOSB and 156 Para chose to head up and over the railway embankment on foot. Once south of the railway line Support and 'B' Company, 156 Para became mixed up with 10 Para making towards Wolfheze, while the battalion headquarters and other two companies headed further south. At 20:30 divisional headquarters issued orders for all units to fall back on a position around the Hartenstein Hotel in Oosterbeek.Peters and Buist, p.193 The Germans continued to pressure 4th Parachute Brigade and 10 Para dug in around Wolfheze. 156 Para to their south came under constant attack leading to fighting at close quarters throughout the night and into the next morning.Peters and Buist, p.186 20 September In the east about 400 men, the remnants of 11 Para, the 1st Parachute Brigade and the 2nd South Staffordshires, having failed to break through to the trapped 2nd Parachute Battalion were trickling back towards Oosterbeek. They were gathered together and eventually placed under the command of Major Richard Lonsdale of 11 Para.Peters and Buist, p.209 Known as \\"Lonsdale Force\\", in the following day's fighting two of its men would be awarded the Victoria Cross, Lance-Sergeant John Baskeyfield, and Major Robert Cain. The woods at Wolfheze to the west of Oosterbeek. At daylight 4th Parachute Brigade started moving east towards the division at Oosterbeek, where the KOSB, moving through the night, had already arrived. Only the parachute battalions and brigade troops remained outside of the village.Peters and Buist, pp.197‚Äì198 The order of march was 10 Para followed by brigade troops then 156 Para bringing up the rear.Powell, p.85 Virtually surrounded, the brigade fought a running hand-to- hand battle with German infantry supported by armour as they attempted to break through.Peters and Buist, p.207 During the fighting commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Des Voeux and the second in command of 156 Para were killed in action. Another high ranking casualty was the commanding officer of 10 Para Lieutenant-Colonel Ken Smyth, who was wounded and became a prisoner of war. With 156 Para leading, the remnants of the brigade carried out a bayonet charge and cleared the Germans from a large hollow which provided some shelter for the exhausted troops.Powell, pp.198‚Äì199 Pinned down all day and with their numbers dwindling, at 17:00 Brigadier Hackett led a charge towards the divisions position, only the Brigadier and 150 men made it. The battalions were then allocated positions on the eastern side of the perimeter, but by now they were battalions in name only. 156 Para had just 53 men under Major Geoffrey Powell,Powell, p.214 while 10 Para were only slightly better off with 60 men although all its battalion officers were missing. As a result, Captain Peter Barron of the brigade's anti-tank battery was given command of 10 Para.Peters and Buist, p.224 One of the official war photographers inside the perimeter wrote: > \\"This is the fourth day of fighting and camera work is almost out of the > question. All day we have been under shell, mortar and machine gun fire. We > are completely surrounded and our perimeter is becoming smaller every hour, > now it is a matter of fighting for our lives. If our land forces don't make > contact with us soon then we've had it\\". > See also 21 September After holding out in Arnhem for four nights and three days, the 2nd Parachute Battalion surrendered overnight.Clark, p.194 At Oosterbeek there was around 3,000 men of the 1st Airborne Division dug in to form a perimeter. Everything including ammunition was now in short supply and most of the men had not eaten for over twenty-four hours.Powell, p.246 Headquarters 4th Parachute Brigade began to function again and a small number of stragglers from the parachute battalions were reunited with their units.Powell, p.244 The brigade was now responsible for all units in the eastern half of the perimeter.Urquhart, p.121 In descending order from north to south were the 1st Airborne Reconnaissance Squadron, 156 Para, 'D' Squadron GPR, 10 Para at the Oosterbeek crossroads, 'C' Squadron GPR, 21st Independent Parachute Company, the RASC Detachment and finally Lonsdale Force.Clark, p.168 Glider Pilots searching Oosterbeek for German infiltrators. In the south-east Lonsdale Force's Major Cain armed with a PIAT anti-tank projectile engaged in a fight with German armoured vehicles for which he would be awarded the Victoria Cross. Elsewhere around the brigade's positions the Germans mounted a number of small attacks, at times supported by armour. Shortage of ammunition made the defenders hold fire until the Germans got within . The tactic was successful and time after time the Germans were beaten back.Clark, pp.194‚Äì195 In between German infantry attacks, the defenders came under almost constant mortar and artillery bombardment,Powell, p.237 which was responsible for the destruction of the divisional ammunition dump.Urquhart, p.122 At one stage Major Powell of 156 Para discovered that he and his men were surrounded when the British units on either side of them pulled back without informing them. Asking for permission to withdraw, he gained the impression that headquarters had forgotten about them or thought they had been wiped out.Powell, pp.237‚Äì239 The gaps in the perimeter did allow individual German snipers to infiltrate brigade positions and the Glider Pilots had to send out dedicated anti-sniper patrols to hunt them down.Clark, p.207 Patrols from both sides moved around the brigade's area and anyone caught in the open during daylight was liable to be confronted by the other side and shot.Powell, p.240 Touring his brigade positions, Brigadier Hackett, Lieutenant-Colonel Thompson of the artillery and the Brigade Major Tiny Maddon, were caught in the open by mortar fire. Maddon was killed outright while Hackett and Thompson were both wounded and taken to the house of Mrs Kate ter Horst for treatment.Urquhart, p.125 Two days later than expected, the parachute battalions of the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade landed south of the River Rhine to the east of Driel.Clark, p.197 Although unable to cross the river, the Poles at least relieved the pressure on the troops at Oosterbeek, when the Germans diverted 2,400 troops to contain them.Peters and Buist, p.234 By now the division had made first contact with XXX Corps to the south and could call upon the guns of 64 Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery to break up German attacks.Clark, p.196 The Poles arrival rejuvenated the Germans, at 18:40 Lonsdale Force was attacked. The next attack came at 19:05 in the west and 10 Para were attacked at 20:10. First, houses holding 10 Para were set alight then assaulted by German infantry, but they continued to hold out.Urquhart, p.129 22 September Inside the division's perimeter, a jeep burns after being hit during a mortar bombardment. The previous day's attacks had contracted the division's perimeter; it was now about wide at the river, stretching north for where it widened out to around .Urquhart, p.132 The brigade's three original parachute battalions now consisted of five officers and sixty men in 156 Para. Two officers with one hundred men in 11 Para and thirty men in 10 Para.Saunders, p.262 With their losses in men and vehicles beginning to tell, German troops attacking the perimeter changed tactics and now tended to rely more on artillery and mortars than on infantry and armour to break through the British line. However, in the attacks on Lonsdale Force, the Germans persisted in attacking in company strength supported by one or two armoured vehicles.Urquhart, p.124 The method employed by the Germans was a tank or SP gun would move up and down a street blowing holes in the house walls. This would be followed up by supporting infantry who would try and use the holes to gain entry to the houses.Peters and Buist, p.237 During the day men from Lonsdale Force and the 21st Independent Company stalked and destroyed two SP guns then engaged the supporting infantry.Urquhart, p.137 South of the river, the first unit from the Guards Armoured Division, the Household Cavalry, had fought through and linked up with the Poles at Driel.Clark, p.202 That night the brigade made the first attempt to get men of the Polish Parachute Brigade across the Rhine. Under the command of Captain Harry Brown of the brigade's engineer squadron, fifteen men with a makeshift fleet of six boats, managed to transport fifty- five Poles across the river.Peters and Buist, p.245 23 September The day began with a four-hour artillery and mortar bombardment and all indications were of an attack in force on 156 Para and 'D' Squadron GPR.Powell, p.263 At 07:42 the attack started and at 07:50, by now under intense pressure, Brigade headquarters called down artillery fire almost on top of their own positions which broke up the assault. Attacks continued all morning and a shortage of hand held anti-tank weapons allowed German tanks to safely approach the brigade's positions. The tanks targeted the houses shooting up a room at a time, forcing the defenders out and into trenches dug in the gardens. Both units managed to hold out, however their situation was officially described as \\"grim\\".Peters and Buist, pp.250‚Äì251 The numbers of British casualties exhausted all available medical supplies and wound dressings. Those wounded who required urgent treatment were now directed to the Schoonoord Hotel, which was in German hands.Peters and Buist, p.249 A fresh German assault on Lonsdale Force in the south-east saw the Germans demolish defended houses with high explosives or set them on fire with incendiary shells.Urquhart, p.146 At midday a German officer under a white flag asked to speak to Brigadier Hackett. He explained they were about to attack the area supported by an artillery and mortar barrage. He knew there were wounded in the nearby Casualty Clearing Station (CCS) and suggested that the brigade's forward positions were moved back. Hackett refused to move, not least because to do so would have placed divisional headquarters behind the new German front line.Urquhart, p.147 Although the expected artillery barrage did arrive, no rounds landed in the area of the CCS.Urquhart, p.148 24 September Overnight a second attempt was made to reinforce 1st Airborne Division with Polish paratroops using boats belonging to the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division. Those men that did cross the river were to go into the line under command of the 4th Parachute Brigade. Despite the urgent need for reinforcements, the operation did not begin until 03:00.Peters and Buist, p.254 Only twelve boats were available and by dawn, 200 Poles had been carried across the river.Urquhart, p.152 While en route to reinforce 'D' Squadron GPR, the Poles were caught in the open by machine-gun fire, killing their commander, Captain Gazurek, and another man. Pinned down all day, the Poles only reached the glider pilots' position after dark.Peters and Buist, p.258 After welcoming the Poles to the brigade, Brigadier Hackett departed for headquarters and was caught in the open during a mortar barrage and wounded again .Urquhart, p.153 The seriously injured Hackett was taken to the CCS in the Hartenstein Hotel, and command of 4th Parachute Brigade given to Lieutenant-Colonel Iain Murray of the Glider Pilot Regiment.Urquhart, pp.153‚Äì154 That afternoon a truce was agreed to allow evacuation of British wounded from inside the perimeter. Over 450 wounded including Brigadier Hackett were taken into German captivity.Urquhart, p.158 25 September By now the perimeter along the river was only about wide. In the south-east a large force of Germans managed to break through the brigade's perimeter and overran one of the division's artillery batteries, located at the rear of Lonsdale Force. The other artillery batteries opened fire on the Germans from a range of and requested infantry as well as anti-tank weapons to come to their assistance.Urquhart, p.170 The German force including two Panther tanks and SP guns, came close to cutting the defenders off from the river and were only defeated by the artillery, followed up by bayonet and grenade counter- attacks.Peters and Buist, p.270 Lonsdale Force spent the rest of the day in close quarters battles with Waffen SS infantry. The fight was likened to a \\"snowball fight with grenades\\" and at least one tank was destroyed with a Gammon bomb. In the afternoon, more Germans managed to infiltrate the perimeter. Only intervention by the guns of 64 Medium Regiment firing on the British positions prevented the division's headquarters from being overrun.Urquhart, p.171 Airborne prisoners of war many of them wounded, being marched into captivity. South of the river Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks, commander of XXX Corps and Lieutenant-General Frederick Browning of I Airborne Corps, decided not to reinforce the position north of the Rhine. Instead they ordered the Corps staff to prepare a plan to withdraw the division (Operation Berlin).Clark, p.228 The evacuation of the surviving 2,500 men able to make the crossing was to begin at 20:45.Peters and Buist, p.274 The evacuation would be from north to south, and was modelled on the evacuation from Gallipoli in the First World War.Urquhart, p.167 During the day's fighting, some units had become isolated and never received the order to evacuate.Peters and Buist, p.273 Those capable of taking part were formed into groups of fourteen (the maximum capacity of the boats) and guided to the river by men from the Glider Pilot RegimentUrquhart, p.169 who during the day had reconnoitred and marked out two routes to the river. Under cover of an artillery barrage the evacuation started at 22:00.Urquhart, p.168 German infiltration of the perimeter caused problems during the withdrawal and some groups got into fire fights or were captured. When they reached the river, priority was given to the wounded and regardless of rank the soldiers waited in line for their turn to get into the boats.Peters and Buist, p.282 The crossing was not secure and when the Germans realised something was happening they opened fire with machine-guns and targeted the south bank with artillery fire, sinking some boats or killing their crews.Peters and Buist, p.283 At dawn the evacuation ended with around 500 men still waiting on the north bank. A small number of men tried to swim across and some made it to the far bank.Peters and Buist, p.287 Of the men left behind, 200 evaded capture and reached the safety of the south bank over the following days.Peters and Buist, p.296 Outcome The 1st Airborne Division had taken 11,500 men to Arnhem where 1,440 were killed and just over half, some 5,960 men, were prisoners of war of whom 3,000 had been wounded before capture. Of the 4th Parachute Brigade's 2,170 men who arrived in Arnhem, 252 were killed, 462 were evacuated and 1,456 were missing or prisoners of war.Nigl, p.75 Their total casualties amounted to seventy-eight per cent, and while severe they were not the highest in the division. The 1st Airlanding Brigade suffered eighty‚Äìone per cent casualties, slightly lower than the eighty‚Äìeight per cent figure for the overall division.Nigl, p.77 The 4th Parachute Brigade never recovered from the battle of Arnhem and was disbanded, those men who had been evacuated were used to reform the battalions of the 1st Parachute Brigade.Middlebrook, p.455 Territorial Army In 1947, a new 4th Parachute Brigade was raised as part of Territorial Army and assigned to the 16th Airborne Division. It was composed of the 10th Battalion, Parachute Regiment, the 11th Battalion, Parachute Regiment and the 14th Battalion, Parachute Regiment. In 1950, the brigade was renumbered the 44th Parachute Brigade (TA).

State Route 117 (SR 117) is an east-west highway in the western part of the U.S. state of Ohio. Its western terminus is at State Route 118 near Rockford, and its eastern terminus is at U.S. Route 33 near Huntsville. It goes through the towns of Spencerville and Lima, and comes close to Indian Lake. East of Lima, the route takes a southeast to south-southeast heading to its eastern terminus. History State Route 117 was an original state highway that went from State Route 116 a few miles east of Spencerville to Bellefontaine, with the portion from Huntsville to Bellefontaine a concurrency with then State Route 32. In 1926, rerouting switched State Route 116 and State Route 198 so that the former would have a straighter heading. State Route 198 was given State Route 116's former heading into Wapakoneta and was truncated at route State Route 117's then-western terminus, and State Route 117 was extended on State Route 116's former eastern heading through Spencerville and all the way to then-State Route 9 (now U.S. Route 127) through Mendon. In the same year, its concurrency with State Route 32 was ended, and its eastern terminus was moved to Huntsville. In 1938, another rerouting moved State Route 117's western terminus to its current terminus. Its route through Mendon was recertified as State Route 707. In 1950, State Route 117 was once again routed in a concurrency to Bellefontaine, this time with U.S. Route 33 (which had replaced State Route 32 in 1938). This concurrency was ended in 1968, and State Route 117 was truncated at its current eastern terminus.

An artist takes multi-colored mizuame and, using their hands and other tools such as tweezers and scissors, creates a sculpture. Amezaiku artists also paint their sculpted candy with edible dyes to give the finished work more character. Animals and insects are common amezaiku shapes created to appeal to children. Intricate animal characters are created with expert speed. Some amezaiku artists are also street performers who perform magic tricks and tell stories along with their candy craft entertainment.  History  During the Heian period, the art of amezaiku was used in Japan for candy offerings made at temples in Kyoto. The amezaiku craft spread beyond the temple during the Edo period, when many forms of street performance flourished in Japan and when its base ingredient, mizuame, became widely available. In Edo it emerged in its present artistic form.  Methods  The candy base is prepared beforehand, using a starchy syrup recipe that requires careful monitoring to ensure proper consistency and appearance. The mixture is kneaded and pulled by hand, and formed into a large ball to be stored until ready to use. At the stall, the candy ball is heated to make it pliable again. The artist puts their hand into the hot mass to pinch up the material necessary; this too is a skill, as the artist must learn to tolerate the painful heat of the medium. The hot candy is quickly rolled and mounted on a stick, then pulled, twisted and clipped into form, usually an animal of some kind and often intricate. Speed is necessary to the art since the sculpture must be completed before the candy cools and hardens again. One method formerly used in sculpting amezaiku was blowing into the candy by means of a straw, similar to glass-blowing. This practice was eventually prohibited in Japan as unhygienic, although other means of introducing blown air may be used.

The sets and costumes were designed by Carl Toms and it ran for two years at the Phoenix Theatre in central London, UK. The lead roles of Richard Wagner and Ruth Carson were created by John Thaw and Diana Rigg, respectively. The play is post-colonial in nature, a satire on the British news media, and an exploration of its discourse. Stoppard employs yet another sub-text in Night and Day by commenting on the very form of language through his remarks on journalism (Stoppard is a former journalist himself). There is a consistent use of pun and innuendo sprinkled in the dialogues of each character. This kind of linguistic play with words and meaning, has marked the playwright for his interest and most keen observations on the aesthetics of language. Night and Day throws up themes of colonization, journalism, language, and alternate or multiple realities. The plot narrative unfolds through the silent or subconscious thoughts of Ruth Carson, who is a by-stander to the main events taking place around her. She is regularly shown to express conflicting ideas between what she is saying, and what she is actually thinking. The narrative technique merges the forms of fiction and non-fiction, where Stoppard has created an imaginary country called Kambawi, located in Africa, and situated in a post-colonial timespace. The story of the play unveils the politics under which the British media approach the coverage of the impending internal war in this country, through the paradigms of objectivity, factual reportage and the inevitable realities of linguistic manipulation and double meaning. Reception Night and Day won the Evening Standard Award for Best Play. In a positive review, Michael Billington wrote, ‚ÄúStoppard himself once said, ‚ÄòWhat's wrong with bad art is that the artist knows exactly what he is doing.‚Äô Night and Day is an exhilarating refutation of that thesis: It's good art (wittiy [sic], stimulating, alive with ideas) but the result of a perfectly conscious intention. A Doll's House, Saint Joan and Mother Courage are three examples of masterpieces written out of a sense of burning conviction. And while Night and Day may not reach that level, it does at least prove that Stoppard can write about what is closest to his heart without sacrificing his natural dexterity. Passion and wit don't often go together, when they do we should applaud.‚Äù See also * Mr. Asrari's Journalistic World by Bahram Beyzai References Plays by Tom Stoppard 1978 plays ","title":"Night and Day (play)"},{"id":"6442191","text":"The palmar carpal branch of the radial artery is a small branch of the radial artery which arises near the lower border of the pronator quadratus, and, running across the front of the carpus, anastomoses with the palmar carpal branch of the ulnar artery.

The brigade was formed in late 1941 during World War II through the conversion of an existing infantry brigade previously stationed in India, the 31st Independent Infantry Brigade. Two of the initial four infantry battalions left in May 1943 to form the new 6th Airlanding Brigade of the 6th Airborne Division and were replaced by a single new battalion, thereby reducing the brigade's strength by one quarter. The brigade only saw action on two occasions during the Second World War, in Operation Ladbroke, as part of the Allied invasion of Sicily, in July 1943 and later in Operation Market Garden in September 1944. During the second operation, in the fighting around Arnhem, 1st Airlanding Brigade along with the rest of 1st Airborne Division held out against overwhelming German odds, sustaining very heavy losses. Only around 20 percent of the brigade were evacuated south of the River Rhine. The rest had either been killed, were missing or became prisoners of war. Following the German surrender in mid-1945, 1st Airlanding Brigade were sent to Norway to disarm the German garrison. Later the same year the brigade was disbanded. Formation Under the command of Brigadier George F. Hopkinson, the 1st Airlanding Brigade Group was formed on 10 October 1941 through the re-designation of the 31st Independent Infantry Brigade, which had just returned to the United Kingdom after training for mountain warfare in British India.Ferguson, p.6 Upon formation, the brigade consisted of the 1st Battalion, Border Regiment (Borders), the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment (Staffords), the 2nd Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (OBLI), the 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles (Ulsters) and supporting units. These were the brigade's original infantry battalions and all remained part of its order of battle. Men in the battalions who were unsuitable for airborne service were weeded out and replaced by volunteers.Blockwell and Clifton, p.63 Glider infantry inside an Airspeed Horsa glider The strength of the airlanding brigade almost equalled that of an airborne division's two parachute brigades.Guard, p.37 To support the four infantry battalions, the brigade also had its own artillery, engineer and reconnaissance units until 1942, when they became divisional assets. Another change that affected the brigade occurred in May 1943, when the Ulsters and the OBLI left to form the 6th Airlanding Brigade, of the 6th Airborne Division. When the brigade returned to the United Kingdom, it was assigned the 7th Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB) in December 1943, a 2nd Line Territorial Army unit, which had until then been on home defence duties, stationed in the Orkney and Shetland islands.Blockwell and Clifton, p.58 The brigade's glider infantry battalions consisted of 806 men in four rifle companies, each with four platoons along with a support company consisting of two Anti-tank platoons each with four 6 pounder guns, two mortar platoons armed with six 3 inch mortars, and two Vickers machine gun platoons.Peters and Buist, p.55 Transport for the brigade was normally the Airspeed Horsa glider, piloted by two men from the Glider Pilot Regiment.Tugwell, p.39 With a wingspan of and a length of , the Horsa had a maximum load capacity of ‚Äîspace for two pilots, a maximum of twenty-eight troops or two jeeps, one jeep and an artillery gun or one jeep with a trailer.Fowler, p.9Peters and Buist, p.9 Sixty‚Äìtwo Horsa and one General Aircraft Hamilcar gliders were required to carry the airlanding battalion into action. The Hamilcar carried the battalion's two Universal Carriers used to support the mortar and machine-gun platoons. Operations Sicily Allied landings in Sicily The 1st Airborne Division, including the 1st Airlanding Brigade, left England for North Africa in June 1943. The brigade now comprised only two battalions, the 1st Border Regiment and the 2nd South Staffordshire Regiment, with Brigadier Philip \\"Pip\\" Hicks, in command, Brigadier Hopkinson having been promoted to major-general and given command of the 1st Airborne Division from Major- General Browning. The 1st Ulster Rifles and the 2nd Ox and Bucks remained in England to help create the 6th Airlanding Brigade. Once they arrived in the theatre the brigade was based in the Oran area on the north-western Mediterranean coast of Algeria. Now part of the British Eighth Army, training for the Allied invasion of Sicily, code-named Operation Husky, started in earnest. Major-General Hopkinson had persuaded General Bernard Montgomery, commander of the Eighth Army, to include the 1st Airborne Division in the invasion of Sicily, against the wishes of both the commander of the British Airborne Forces, Major-General Browning and the commander of the Glider Pilot Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Chatterton. Both men were concerned that they had insufficient aircraft for the complete division to take part while British pilots and infantry were not familiar with the Waco CG-4 gliders that were to be used.Ferguson, p.10 Their concerns proved correct as there were only enough aircraft for two of the division's four brigades to take part in the invasion. The 1st Parachute Brigade was assigned to Operation Fustian with orders to seize and hold the Primosole Bridge over the River Simeto. Prior to that, the 1st Airlanding Brigade was to take part in Operation Ladbroke, a glider assault on the Ponte Grande bridge across the Anapo river south of Syracuse. The brigade was to hold the bridge until relieved by the advance of the British 5th Infantry Division.Ferguson, p.11Mitcham and Von Stauffenberg, p.73 The 1st Airlanding Brigade was allocated 136 Waco and eight Airspeed Horsa gliders for the operation. Six of the Horsas carrying two infantry companies were scheduled to land at the bridge at 23:15 on 9 July in a coup-de-main operation.Tugwell, p.159 The remainder of the brigade would arrive at 01:15 on 10 July using a number of landing-zones between away, then converge on the bridge to reinforce the defence. One of the 1st Airlanding Brigade's Willys MBs being loaded aboard a Waco glider On 9 July, 2,075 men of the brigade along with seven Willys MBs, six artillery guns and ten mortars, boarded their gliders in Tunisia and took off at 18:00 bound for Sicily. En route they encountered strong winds, poor visibility and at times were subjected to anti- aircraft fire. To avoid gunfire and searchlights, pilots of the towing aircraft climbed higher or took evasive action. In the confusion surrounding these manoeuvres, some gliders were released too early and 65 of them crashed into the sea, drowning around 252 men. Of the remaining gliders only 12 landed at the correct landing-zones. Another 59 landed up to away while the remainder were either shot down or failed to release and returned to Tunisia.Mitcham and Von Stauffenberg, pp.73‚Äì74 Only one Horsa with a platoon of infantry from the Staffords landed near the bridge. Its commander, Lieutenant Louis Withers, divided his men into two groups then swam across the river with half of them to take up positions on the opposite bank. Thereafter the bridge was captured following a simultaneous assault from both sides. The platoon then dismantled demolition charges that had been fitted to the bridge and dug in to wait for reinforcement or relief.Mitcham and Von Stauffenberg, p.74 Another Horsa landed about from the bridge but exploded on landing, killing all on board. Three of the other Horsas carrying the coup-de-main party, landed within of the bridge‚Äîtheir occupants eventually finding their way to the site.Tugwell, p.160 Reinforcements began to arrive at the bridge but by 06:30 they numbered only 87 men.Mitcham and Von Stauffenberg, p.75 Elsewhere, about 150 men landed at Cape Murro di Porco and captured a radio station. Based on a warning of imminent glider landings transmitted by the station's previous occupants, the local Italian commander ordered a counter-attack but his troops failed to get the message. The scattered nature of the landings now worked in the brigade's favour as they were able to cut all telephone wires in the immediate area. Forces at the bridge came under repeated attacks from the Italians while the expected 5th Infantry Division relief did not appear at 10:00 as planned. By 15:30 only 15 of men at the bridge remained fit to fight and they were out of ammunition, as a result the Italians then recaptured the bridge. The first unit from the 5th Division, the 2nd Northamptonshire Regiment of the 17th Brigade, arrived at the bridge at 16:15 and mounted a successful counterattack. The prior removal of demolition charges from the bridge had prevented the Italians from destroying it.Tugwell, p.161 The brigade then took no further part in the fighting and was withdrawn back to North Africa on 13 July.Mitcham and Von Stauffenberg, p.78 During the landings in Sicily, the losses by the 1st Airlanding Brigade were the worst of all the British units involved so far.Tugwell, p.162 They amounted to 313 killed and 174 missing or wounded. The accompanying glider pilots lost 14 killed, and a further 87 were missing or wounded. Arnhem Arnhem area showing the designated drop and landing zones After service in the Mediterranean the brigade returned to Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire, where it was reinforced by the arrival of the 7th Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers in November 1943.Blockwell and Clifton, p.61 During the Normandy landings, the 1st Airlanding Brigade was part of the strategic reserve, on standby to deploy wherever they were needed to support the invasion.Urquhart, p.16 The division and brigade were next assigned to Operation Market Garden at Arnhem in the Netherlands. This entailed three airborne divisions capturing bridges to be used subsequently by the British Second Army.Urquhart, pp.1‚Äì3 Prior to the operation, more than 15 planned airborne missions into France and Belgium had been cancelled due to the speed of the Allied advance.Peters and Buist, pp.18‚Äì28 A shortage of transport aircraft meant that it would take three days to transport the division to Arnhem. The plan called for the majority of the 1st Airlanding Brigade and the 1st Parachute Brigade to land on day one. The parachute brigade would head for Arnhem and capture the bridges over the Lower Rhine while the airlanding brigade secured drop zones for units arriving on the second and third days.Urquhart, pp.5‚Äì10 When all the division's units had arrived the brigade would take up defensive positions to the west of Arnhem.Tugwell, p.239 The 1st Airlanding Brigade units arriving on the second lift were to be two companies plus one mortar, one machine gun and one anti- tank platoon of the Staffords,Peters and Buist, p.328 along with three platoons and sections from the mortar, machine gun and anti-tank platoons of the KOSB.Peters and Buist, pp.328‚Äì330 The Borders contingent amounted to a further eight platoons. On 17 September 1944, the first lift successfully carried the majority of the brigade to Arnhem‚Äîonly 12 gliders failed to arrive due to technical problems.Peters and Buist, p.80Tugwell, p.244 While the 1st Parachute Brigade headed for Arnhem the airlanding brigade dug in to secure the landing grounds. The Staffords dug in around landing zone 'S', the KOSB around drop zone 'Y' and the Borders around landing zone 'X'.Peters and Buist, p.127 Also under command of the brigade, co-located with brigade headquarters at Wolfheze were the Glider pilots of No. 2 Wing, Glider Pilot Regiment, the equivalent of a small infantry battalion.Peters and Buist, p.57 Men of the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment advance toward Arnhem, towing a 6 pounder Anti‚ÄìTank gun, 18 September On the night of 17‚Äì18 September, divisional commander Major-General Roy Urquhart was reported missing. Brigadier Philip Hugh Whitby Hicks assumed command of the divisionTugwell, p.258 while Colonel Hilaro Barlow replaced Hicks as brigade commander.Urquhart, p.61 On day two, problems in Arnhem forced Hicks to change the divisional plan. Only the 2nd Parachute Battalion had reached the road bridge‚Äîstrong German defences had halted the other battalions so Hicks decided that the Staffords would link up with the 1st Parachute Brigade in an attempt to reach their objective. However, the Staffords also failed to break through the German defenders.Urquhart, p.72 Bad weather over England kept the planned second lift on the ground. The first troops did not arrive until 15:00, a delay that gave the Germans time to approach the landing grounds and engage the KOSB in numerous probing attacks on the northern perimeter. At one stage KOSB commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Payton-Reid led a bayonet charge to clear the Germans from the area. Meanwhile, the Borders were repeatedly attacked from the south of landing zone's 'X' and 'Z', and were eventually forced to call on the 75 mm guns of the 1st Airlanding Light Regiment to break up the attacks. Hicks had previously decided to send the Staffords on the second lift to join their battalion fighting in Arnhem, while he also sent the 11th Parachute Battalion on the same lift to support 1st Parachute Brigade.Urquhart, p.76 The KOSB, until then responsible for defending the landing ground, were attached to 4th Parachute Brigade to replace the 11th Parachute Battalion. However they were still responsible for defending landing ground 'L', for the arrival of the Poles gliders on day three. This left only the Borders, No. 2 Wing GPR and the field ambulance under brigade command.Urquhart, p.60 As day three dawned, the Staffords, and the 1st Parachute Battalion attacked at 04:00, their first objective being to link up with the 3rd Parachute Battalion trapped around St Elizabeth's Hospital. The attack failed but allowed Urquhart to rejoin the division from a position where he had been trapped by the Germans. This allowed Hicks to resume command of the brigade,Clark, p.170 whereupon Urquhart dispatched Colonel Barlow to take over command of 1st Parachute Brigade and co-ordinate the attack in Arnhem. He left in a jeep and was killed in a mortar barrage just outside Arnhem.Middlebrook, p.211 The 1st Airlanding Brigade, still holding landing zone 'L' for the expected Polish and resupply gliders, then came under attack from the west and north-west. During the night the KOSB had tried to take the high ground at Koepel, but were stopped by heavy machine gun fire and instead dug in.Urquhart, p.85 The remainder of 4th Parachute Brigade advancing north of the railway line also encountered a strong German defence line and were unable to progress any further. All three battalions were ordered to withdraw south of the railway line towards Wolfheze. Although the northernmost battalion of the KOSB had thus far enjoyed a quiet morning, in the two hours it took them to advance south of the railway, two companies were now cut off and the entire battalion transport lost.Urquhart, p.91 Still under fire from the pursuing Germans, the battalions crossed landing zone 'L' just as the third lift gliders were landing. While attempting to unload the gliders the Poles came under fire. Assuming the approaching men were Germans, they opened fire and caused some casualties.Clark, pp.170‚Äì171 Brigadier Philip Hugh Whitby Hicks at Arnhem, 1944 With no one in command, around 100 men, the remnants of the Staffords, along with about 400 troops from the 1st Parachute Brigade, pulled back towards Oosterbeek. Here they were gathered together in an ad hoc formation known as the \\"Lonsdale Force\\" after Major Richard Lonsdale who was put in command. The Lonsdale Force deployed to the south-east of Oosterbeek to defend the division's artillery line.Clark, p.173Urquhart, p.95 Here, as dusk approached, Lance Serjeant John Baskeyfield of the Staffords, although wounded and with the rest of his men dead or wounded, engaged three tanks as they emerged from the woods with his anti-tank gun. He destroyed the first tank and disabled the second before his own weapon was destroyed. Moving to a nearby gun where the crew were already dead, he continued to fight the third tank alone. Shortly after he managed to disable it, he was killed a shell from a German tank. For his actions Baskeyfield received a posthumous Victoria Cross, the highest British military decoration. The KOSB had by now arrived at the perimeter being formed around Oosterbeek and took up positions south of the railway line just north of division headquarters.Urquhart, p.101 Men of the 1st Airlanding Brigade at Wolfheze By day four, the battalions of the 1st Airlanding Brigade were dispersed over a wide area. While the Borders were to the west on a line from the River Rhine east of Heveadorp to the Heelsum road, the remaining KOSB companies lay to the north with the remnants of the Staffords forming part of Lonsdale Force in the east. Brigade headquarters was established on open ground at the centre of the divisional area.Urquhart, p.118 On day five (21 September), defence of the divisional area was divided between the two remaining brigade headquarters. The 1st Airlanding Brigade in the west now commanded the remaining three companies of Borders, the remnants of the KOSB, and what remained of the Royal Engineers, 21st Independent Company, Glider Pilots and Poles.Urquhart, p.121 Lonsdale Force Major Robert Henry Cain of the Staffords disabled a tank with a PIAT and then, although wounded by machine gun fire, positioned one of the division's artillery guns and destroyed it. This was the first of a number of actions by Major Cain which led to the award of a Victoria Cross. This second medal for the Staffords meant it became the only British battalion to receive two Victoria Crosses in one battle during the Second World War. The Germans did not mount an all-out infantry assault on the divisional area, which was under continuous mortar and artillery attack. Instead, each sector was subjected to small scale assaults at times supported by tanks or self-propelled guns. Enemy troops first attacked the Independent Company, then the Borders who were forced off the high ground overlooking the river, and finally the KOSB.Clark, p.195Urquhart, p.124 The Germans mounted a strong assault following the landing of the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade south of the river beside Driel. This attack forced the KOSB out of their positions, which were only regained after a bayonet charge. Fighting was so fierce that first reports suggested the KOSB had been annihilated,Urquhart, p.128 although it turned out that the counter-attack had in fact reduced the battalion's strength to only 150 men.Urquhart, p.127 By day six, 22 September, the battle had settled into a routine of mortaring and small probing attacks at times supported by armoured vehicles and sniper fire. The Poles, dug in south of the river, relieved part of the pressure on the division, as some German forces were diverted to confront them.Urquhart, p.135 The following day began in a similar way to previous days with a mortar and artillery bombardment, followed by infantry and armour trying to find a gap in the perimeter. The KOSB, Glider Pilots and the 21st Independent Company who were all defending the brigade area were repeatedly attacked.Clark, p.220 Furthermore, food and water shortages also took their toll on the men, with foraging parties subjected to sniper fire.Clark, p.219 On day eight, 24 September, although German attacks continued, the enemy were engaged by artillery of the XXX Corps south of the river and aircraft from the Royal Air Force. This broke up most assaults before they got started.Clark, p.224 On 25 September Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks, commander of XXX Corps, decided not to reinforce the position north of the Rhine and instead prepare for the evacuation of all survivors in Operation Berlin.Clark, p.228 The evacuation took place on the night of 25‚Äì26 September.Clark, pp.232‚Äì234 Of the 2,526 men of 1st Airlanding Brigade that left England for Operation Market Garden, there were 230 killed, 476 evacuated and 1,822 were missing or prisoners of war.Nigl, p.75 Norway Men of the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment, Oslo After Arnhem, replacements for the 1st Airlanding Brigade began to bring the brigade up to strength. Among the replacements was Brigadier Roger Bower who took the place of the injured Brigadier Hicks. However, the Germans surrendered before they were involved in further action. The 1st Airborne Division including the airlanding brigade, the Special Air Service Brigade and an ad hoc brigade formed from the divisional artillery were sent to disarm the German occupation forces in Norway in May 1945. On entering Norway, the division would be responsible for maintaining law and order in the areas it occupied, ensuring that German units followed the terms of their surrender, securing and then protecting captured airfields, and finally preventing the sabotage of essential military and civilian structures.Otway, p.325 After landing nearby, 1st Airlanding Brigade occupied the Norwegian capital Oslo, where Brigadier Bower became Commander, Oslo Area for the duration of the division's time in Norway. The city was chosen because as well as being the Norwegian capital it was also the centre of the Norwegian and German administration.Otway, pp.325‚Äì326 The brigade returned to the United Kingdom in August 1945, when the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded and the airlanding battalions returned to a conventional infantry role.

Sychkov Fedot Vasilevich Sychkov (), March 13, 1870, Kochelaevo, Russian Empire ‚Äì August 3, 1958, Saransk) was a Russian painter. The early years (1870‚Äì1900) Fedot Vasilyevich Sychkov was born in Penza Governorate, in the village Kochelaevo of Narovchatsky Uyezd, now Kovylkinsky District of Mordovia in 1870. His family was poor, he lost his parents being child. Fedot Sychkov began his education in the three-class school. A few years after its completion and cooperative learning in the icon workshop Sychkov began working as an artist, he painted icons and portraits of peasants. One of the famous works of this period is the picture \\"Founding of Arapovo Station\\" (1892), made for Ivan Arapov, general from St. Petersburg who lived on his estate near Kochelaevo. With his help, young artist Sychkov was sent to St. Petersburg to continue his artistic education in 1892. In the Drawing School of St. Petersburg he continued to improve his skills and create paintings. One of the best paintings of the period is \\"Portrait of the Artist's Younger Sister, Yekaterina Sychkova\\" (1893). Also Sychkov painted custom portraits. In 1895 he began studying at the Higher School of Arts at the Imperial Academy of Arts. In the years of study Sychkov painted several self-portraits. Like many young other of that time, he wanted to study in Ilya Repin‚Äôs workshop, who he was Familiar to. Despite the fact that during these years course of Imperial Academy of Arts Sychkov studied the battle-painting after graduation he found his vocation as a portrait and genre painter. After completing his studies in St. Petersburg Sychkov returned to his homeland. The main topics of his works concerned folk festivals, weddings and other celebrations. He also was very interested in painting everyday village life. For example \\"On The Hills\\" (1910), \\"Skating Carnival\\" (1914). The youth of the artist (1900‚Äì1930) In the years 1900‚Äì1910, Sychkov was the period of artistic maturity. In that time he painted \\"Return of the Fair,\\" \\"Village Wedding,\\" \\"Blessing of the Waters\\", \\"Christ Singers\\", \\"Difficult Transition\\", \\"Flax Combers\\", \\"Return From The Hay\\" and several others. Sychkov tried to tell various aspects of rural life without embell shing of the life. His works attracted by the brightness of the portrait characteristics, accurately build the plastic multi-track to the ability, find expressive poses and gestures that give special emotional openness of the images. In the 1900s. developed front portraits at the time Sychkov was a very popular portrait painter in St. Petersburg. Customers are attracted by his ability to paint quickly and accurately grasping the features of appearance. Among his \\"models\\" were bankers, government officials and society ladies. An excellent example of the front of the portrait is \\"Portrait In Black\\" (1904). Children's portraits became interesting page in work of the painter. For the first time he consulted them in the 900th years, except for a few students' studies where it was posed as a model by children. Among them are \\"Friends\\" (1911), \\"Girlfriends. Children\\" (1916), \\"Grinko\\" (1937). The trip abroad in 1908 became one of his brightest vital impressions.Acquaintance to masterpieces of the West European art became a powerful impulse for further creative activity of the painter, lifted it on qualitatively new artistic level. He brought from Italy and France a lot of scenery.Grandiose buildings of ancient Rome ‚Äì Arch of Constantine, Forum, Colosseum appear in them as symbols of former greatness of the antique empire. The color range constructed on combinations of light yellow-green and blue tones, transfers a hot haze of the southern air in which as if outlines of monuments of an antiquity melt.However at doubtless art advantages of these landscapes, the artist's soul most completely reveals in the works devoted to native places. Tirelessly he painted the native village, crooked fences, ingrown into the land of the hut, the spring floods overflowing Moksha. Intimacy and warmth of sentiment infused with small-sized winter studies are designed in a gray-bluish color. At the heart of landscapes ‚Äì deep poetic feeling, a worship of the master for beauty of the Russian nature exciting in the modest charm. Sychkov's creative range was rather wide. Besides, portraits, landscapes, genre cloths, throughout all life he painted still lifes: from classically clear on manner of performance, as, for example, ¬´The Still life. Fruit¬ª, created in 1908 during a trip across Italy, more characteristic for it still lifes with a landscape approach - \\"Strawberry\\" (1910), \\"Cucumbers\\" (1917), etc. in which in a bit different refraction the same subject of life and a village life sounds. Sychkov liked to work in a garden, in a kitchen.He always was proud to say, \\"I am a peasant!\\" The end of the 1910-1920th ‚Äì it was time when Sychkov created, generally options or repetitions of the early works, continuing to develop favourite and characteristic for it a subject of holidays, varying plots of pre-revolutionary pictures - \\"Girlfriends\\" (1920), \\"Holiday\\" (1927), ¬´The holiday. Girlfriends. Winter¬ª (1929) and several others. His style of painting evolved during this time toward greater brightness of a color. Maturity (1930‚Äì1958) In 1930 the new authorities were trying to dispossess him, counted among individual peasants. It was a difficult time in Sychkov's life. Sychkov continued to participate actively at this time in exhibition life of Moscow and Leningrad, but in Mordovia, very few people knew about it. In 1937 in Mordovia the Union of artists was created. Sychkov's pictures made the real furor. In the 1930s, when the Mordovian autonomy was formed, the special place in creativity of the painter was occupied by a national subject. However, the appeal to this subject cannot be considered as a courtesy towards the authorities as Mordovian ethno - the culture caused long ago interest in the master to what numerous photos from Sychkov's archive testify. Unlike Russian peasants, Mordvinians continued to wear national clothes and during the Soviet period. Dozens of sketches, the etudes of the Mordovian national suit preceding creation of such known pictures as \\"Teacher-Mordvinian\\" (1937), \\"Tractor Driver, Mordvinian\\" (1938). In the second half of the '30s, theme of art Sychkov expanded by reference to the Soviet reality. This time he created paintings \\"Day Off The Farm\\" (1936), \\"The Collective Farm Market\\" (1936), they stand out with their multi-figure compositions, artist‚Äôs ability to distinguish among the mass of the individual characters of people. These works on their ideological orientation were quite in line with Stalin epoch‚Äôs official art. Some traces of the influence of social realism can be found in the custom panel \\"Harvest Festival\\" (1938) and \\"Presentation Of The Eternal Act Of Free Use Of The Land\\" (1938), pompously praising a hard working Soviet man. These two large format canvas were created by the author in the shortest possible time for exhibition hall \\"Volga\\" for the State Agricultural Exhibition in Moscow. Among the works of 1940‚Äì50s, created by the artist in the eighth decade of his life, stand out \\"Return From School\\" (1945) and \\"Meeting With A Hero\\" (1952). It is known that he had serious problems with eyes, but he continued to work. The last two years of life the artist spent in Saransk, continuing the work until the last days. Features of the style of Fedot Sychkov Fedot Sychkov is best known for his compositions containing only one or two figures. Despite the similarity of type of depicted people paintings look in different ways. Basically, there is a pure portrait, where the model is shown in a neutral background. But it gets more developed with time. Centre to all the paintings is a human coexistence with the natural world. In his portraits, landscape always combines with emotional state of characters or contrasts with it. There are not so many compositional innovations in arts of Sychkov. There are some plots going through all the work of the master, for example ‚Äì ‚Äúnear the fence‚Äù, ‚Äúdriving down the hills‚Äù. However, it cannot be reproached for the monotony and the cliche. Sychkov did never aim to the painting of people with complex, contradictory character. The phenomenon of Sychkov as a painter is a loyalty to one theme ‚Äì the theme life of a Russian village, passed through the prism of his artistic vision of peasant life and traditions. Contemporary to Fedot Sychkov peasants abandoned the traditional clothing in everyday life, but he portrayed his models in the traditional Russian sundresses, bright scarves, beads.

Private Money Investing (‚ÄúPMI‚Äù) concerns the SOURCE of the funds lent to hard money borrowers, as well as other considerations made from the INVESTOR‚ÄôS side of the equation. Without these private, non- institutional investors, hard money would not exist. Private money investment industry The industry is not well publicized and is largely centered in California, several Western states, and New York. Lenders are predominantly small, highly specialized mortgage brokers familiar with commercial real estate lending. The trend in California is towards mortgage funds or mortgage pools, which are structured and operate similar to commercial banks. Private Money Bankers or Real Estate Bankers, are groups, individuals, companies or funds, that pool private money, and then lend those pooled funds for profit. Private money investors Investors range from private individuals, trusts, and LLCs to pension funds. Individual investors generally have substantial knowledge and experience in real estate or trust deed investing. Individual investors are tending to pool their money with other sophisticated investors through pooling via Private Money Bankers, also known as Real Estate Bankers, or Private Real Estate Bankers. The motivation for investing includes: the simplicity of the underlying investment and a desire for: 1) An investment secured by real estate 2) Regular income derived from monthly dividend distributions; 3) Higher yields than those available from investing in money market funds or bonds; 4) An Active involvement in real estate finance. The lending process A borrower seeking funds approaches a mortgage broker or private money lender and describes his borrowing needs. These include: 1) The amount of money sought; 2) The value of the property that is being pledged as security, or collateral; 3) A description of the property; 4) The use of funds. The mortgage broker or lender then assesses the proposed loan, focusing on the value of the property being proposed as collateral. The maximum amount that may be borrowed is determined by establishing the amount of ‚Äúprotective equity‚Äù existing in the property. For the private mortgage investor, this equity provides the cushion for the risk taken in extending a loan. In the event that the borrower defaults on the loan, investors recoup their capital by assuming the borrower's equity in the property. Protective equity is calculated by taking the liquidated value of the property (the price at which the property could be sold quickly, usually ninety days), and then subtracting any outstanding debt related to the property in the form of existing loans or tax liens on the property. This amount is then compared to a Loan to Value (‚ÄúLTV‚Äù) ratio. The ratio, established by the lender, represents the maximum amount that the lender will lend a borrower. It is expressed as a percentage of the total amount of protective equity, divided by a percentage. This percentage varies primarily with the type of property that will form the basis of the collateral. Non-income producing or difficult-to-liquidate property carries the lowest ratio. So, raw, undeveloped land may carry a maximum LTV of 50%...if a lender will even consider using it as collateral. Rural income producing property, such as a small shopping center, may similarly carry a low LTV. Example: Appraised land value = $1,200,000 Existing trust deed = $200,000 Equity = $1,200,000 - $200,000 = $1,000,000 LTV = 60% Maximum total Loan Amount available to borrower = 60% of $1,200,000, or $800,000. The lender may choose to place a $600,000 2nd Deed of Trust behind the $200,000 existing Deed of Trust or it may place a new single $800,000 First Trust Deed loan. If the broker determines that the liquidated value of the property falls within acceptable limits, the broker prepares a loan package summarizing the underlying details. If a broker is not involved, the lender performs these functions in-house. The borrower is advised as to an approximate amount of funds that may be borrowed, and is provided with a preliminary estimate of a range of interest rates and loan fees that may be anticipated. This advisement often comes in the form of a Letter of Intent or Letter of Interest prepared by the lender. If the borrower agrees to these figures, the broker proceeds by doing one of two things: 1) He contacts individual Private Money Investors and solicits their direct investment in the loan. This is called FRACTIONAL INVESTMENT [described below]; 2) Alternatively, he brokers the loan by contacting Private Money Lenders known to be interested in making loans of the size, type and location sought by the borrower. These lenders in turn create fractional investments themselves or are MORTGAGE FUNDS [described below].  Underwriting  Following receipt and agreement of the Letter of Intent, the lender performs a rapid review of the property and underlying financing, title and credit issues. This due diligence process includes the preparation of a property appraisal by an independent professional appraiser and, frequently, personal meetings with the borrower and personal inspections of the property by the lenders.  Funding  Following the completion of the preparation and compilation of necessary documentation, the loan proceeds are transferred to the borrower. After a brief pause in financing activities, the borrower then turns his attention to arranging permanent financing to replace the higher cost bridge loan he is committed to.  Methods of investment  Private Mortgage Investment takes three primary forms: Direct Mortgage Investment, Fractional Investment and Mortgage Fund Investment. Direct Mortgage Investment This is the traditional method for investors to extend loans to borrowers for hundreds of years. A single investor (lender) agrees to loan money and secures the obligation by way of a registered mortgage on title of the property. Monthly payments are made directly to the lender. Broker's or \\"middlemen\\" might be involved to make introductions however after the mortgage is funded and the broker is paid a fee, the lender works directly with the borrower. Fractional Investment This is a \\"pooled or syndicated\\" method for multiple investors to extend loans to borrowers. A limited number of investors (in California, 10) secure a loan made to a borrower by placing their names on a First (or Second or Third) Deed of Trust on the borrower's property. Monthly payments are made to a servicing agent, who then distributes the payments pro rata to the individual investors. Fractionals provide the benefits of simplicity and transparency. Each individual investor reviews each prospective loan prior to making a decision to invest. On the downside, ‚Äúbuilding‚Äù each loan investor-by-investor takes time, detracting from one of Private Money's key advantages: speed. By its nature, the investment is not diversified for individual investors. The investment is made entirely to a single borrower, usually on a single property. In the event the borrower fails to make monthly interest payments, the income flow to the investors stops. If the borrower defaults on the loan, this income flow will cease completely. Investment principal and interest will be recaptured only after the loan is renegotiated, or the property securing the loan is foreclosed upon and sold. Further, investors holding larger percentage interests in a fractionalized loan may maintain greater control within the transaction the other, smaller investors. In the event that additional investment funds are required in order to prepare a foreclosed-upon property for sale, investors must come up with these additional funds. Mortgage Fund Investment Mortgage Funds (also, ‚ÄúMortgage Pools‚Äù) resemble equity mutual funds, funds composed of a wide selection of stocks. Investors deposit money in a fund: The fund is managed by mortgage brokers or mortgage bankers certified by the State. Money within the fund is lent to borrowers and is secured by First (or Second or Third) Deeds of Trust naming the FUND as the holder, rather than individual investors. By purchasing shares in a mortgage fund, and as interest is earned from monthly mortgage payments, the fund generates income. There are approximately 100 mortgage funds in California. All are closed-end, meaning the number of investors and amount of investment dollars are capped. Many are closed: They are not accepting new investors. Investor yields are similar to those obtained through fractional investment. The primary difference lies in diversification. Risk is spread across a portfolio of loans, not centered on a single loan as with fractionals. Risk is spread across the entire pool of borrowers, and different types of properties, in different locations. As a result, in the event of a late pay or default, there could be minimal ‚Äì or no ‚Äì impact on investors‚Äô yield. Reserve accounts established by the fund and by its manager would compensate for any shortfall. Another difference in funds is liquidity. If an investor in a fractional wishes to cash in his position, he must either be replaced with another investor, or he must wait for the loan to be paid off by the borrower. Because many private money loans take the form of short term bridge loans lasting less than a year, this waiting period is generally limited. Mortgage funds, however, generally offer rapid ‚Äìsometimes, immediate‚Äîrepayment of principal. This is possible because a) Funds have reserve accounts in place for this purpose; b) Funds are generally oversubscribed, with more investors wanting into the fund than those wanting out. The third difference is control. The situation is analogous in the equity world to investors selecting individual stocks in which to invest, vs. investing in a mutual fund. Whereas fractional investors make the investment decision on each property themselves, fund investors delegate this duty to the fund managers. Other features: Fund participants enjoy 365-day investments ‚Äì they aren‚Äôt sidelined between loan opportunities Less paperwork Subcategories of mortgage fund investments Mortgage notes Under this structure, investors purchase notes from the Manager for a specified period of time with a fixed rate of return. The notes are backed by a security interest in the portfolio of loans within the fund. The primary difference is that the Manager guarantees the funds itself, providing a second layer of security to investors. Returns to investors, however, are lower. Equity ownership programs Here, investors take direct ownership positions within properties that are undergoing rehabilitation or new development, participating as Members within LLCs created specifically for each project. This structure can be used in conjunction with loans extended to the project, so that the investor holds both equity and debt interests. Investor eligibility Minimum net worth requirements must be met by investors (in California) to be eligible to invest in Mortgage Funds operating subject to a Permit. These restrictions are intended to limit Mortgage Fund investment to more experienced investors. Additional restrictions limit the maximum percentage of an individual's self-directed IRA that can be invested. Eligibility: Net worth requirements (California) Either: ‚Ä¢ Annual gross income of $65,000 plus net worth of $250,000 (exclusive of home, furnishings and automobiles) or ‚Ä¢ Net worth of $500,000 (exclusive of home, furnishings and automobiles). Mortgage funds operating pursuant to a Plan (described below) limit investor eligibility to California residents or to International residents. Residents of other states may not participate. Regulatory oversight Fractional investments [in California] fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Real Estate. Regulations require, among other things, that a broker be licensed as a real estate broker by the Department. Mortgage Funds are regulated [in California] by the Department of Corporations. They are established only after the Department reviews a Plan submitted by the managers of the proposed fund, which sets out, in detail, the specifics of the fund's operations, such as LTVs. Funds are limited as to the maximum number of investors they may take into themselves, the minimum initial amount an investor may invest, and the maximum total dollar amount that will be accepted into the fund. Funds are required to submit annual audited financial statements to the Department and to investors. Funds are also subject to operation and investor regulation from the Department of Real Estate and the Department of Industrial Relations. Investment management Fractional investments are generally originated and managed by mortgage brokers specializing in the field. [In California] these brokers operate under the auspices of the Department of Real Estate and are subject to its regulations. Mortgage funds operate under the auspices and regulations of the Department of Corporations subject to Plans that are reviewed and renewed annually by the Department. Funds often are formed as LLCs, and may be referred to as Private Money Banks, or managed by Private Money Bankers. Funds are managed by separate entities which are also subject to Department of Corporations regulations. These entities may be referred to as Private Money Banks, or managed by Private Money Bankers, and provide operational functions for the funds: They originate, underwrite and service the loans enabled by the fund's investors.

Mortgage funds compared to REITs REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) are companies that own and manage commercial properties. Most REITs sell securities that are publicly traded. Investors buy stock in them, seeking to benefit by the stock dividends REITs pay, as well as the appreciation of the price of the stock itself. Similarities Investors place money into funds that invest in real estate. The portfolios are professionally managed for the benefit of the members or stockholders Differences Sources of income: REITS use funds to purchase, manage, improve and sell properties. Investor returns come from operations and from the sale of properties. Mortgage funds use investors‚Äô funds to extend short term gap financing, loans made to commercial borrowers secured by real estate. Pools lend against the value of the property ‚Äì they don't own or manage the property itself, except in rare foreclosure instances. Property types REITs typically own and manage office buildings and shopping centers, although there are REITS specializing in warehouse and other commercial space. Mortgage Funds individually specialize in loans to particular property types, usually located close to their own offices. Across the industry, they extend loans secured by in virtually every type of real estate, from raw land and factories to gas stations and restaurants. Yields REITS showed overall total returns as high as 38.5% in 2005, declining to 8.29% by the end of the year. As of June 1, 2006, REIT returns were 7.42%. Mortgage Funds: Yields virtually always fall within a narrow band 4% to 6% above money market returns. Mortgage fund returns are linked directly to high loan interest payments ‚Äì not stock prices. The math is simple: Investors receive about 2% less than the high interest amount being paid by borrowers. In Q3 2006 yields for most funds range from 9% to 11%. Management fees REITS: Fees vary and can be as much as 35% of revenue. Mortgage Funds: Most funds reserve the right to collect management fees of 1%, with another 1% for servicing fees. In practice, few deduct these fees. Management obtains its income from origination and servicing fees paid by borrowers. Mortgage fund investors are not exposed to any operational expenses of the underlying mortgage business. The fund in effect serves as the ‚Äúbank‚Äù for the manager. It's a source of funds ‚Äì period. Investors receive higher yields because they are not subjected to any operational expenses ‚Äì the cost of actually running a mortgage company. Payouts REITS: The IRS requires that REITs pay out 90% of their earnings each year. Result: they can't preserve much of their income. Mortgage Funds: Face no such restrictions. The future of private money investment Although the traditional fractional investment model will continue, the trend to mortgage funds is accelerating. Reasons: 1\\\\. Increasing property values continue to push prices ‚Äì and loan amounts ‚Äì higher. More investors are necessary for each transaction, a costly and time-consuming process to conduct for each loan. This time lag translates into slower funding for borrowers ‚Äì and more time on the sidelines for investors. 2\\\\. The regulatory preference [in California] will likely continue. The structure, accountability and standards required for mortgage funds provides a better fit for government oversight. 3\\\\. The combination of diversification, liquidity and professional management enabled by mortgage funds will increasingly give them more of the appearance of banks, further adding to investor appeal.

The oldest set out and found a city where the king had proclaimed that whoever found his daughter within eight days would marry her, but anyone who tried and failed would lose his head. The son tried and failed. His second brother followed and also failed. The youngest son, following his brothers, discovered their fates and rebuffed an old woman who sought alms from him. She asked if he was in trouble, and the son explained the situation. She told him that he should purchase a statue of a golden lion that played music, so that he could hide inside it. After the statue was completed, the man hid inside. The old woman showed the lion to the king. When he wanted it, she told him she could only lend it to him overnight. He brought it down a secret stairway to twelve identical women. During the night, the youth implored the princess to help him, and she told him she would wear a white sash when he came hunting for her so he could identify her. The old woman took the lion away. The youth came out of hiding and went to the king, who gave him permission to search for the princess.

It is part of the local government area. History The area was created by a land subdivision in 1918. In 1977, the Geographical Names Board included the small locality within the suburb of Mooney Mooney. However, community pressure from residents and the Mooney-Cheero Progress Association Inc. led to Gosford City Council recommending the separate gazettal of Cheero Point in its meeting on 5 November 2002, and the suburb name was officially reassigned on 21 March 2003. The suburb made headlines when landslides near Jolls Bridge forced the closure of a 250-metre section of the Pacific Highway for several years. By March 1990, only one lane remained open, and in April 1991 the highway was closed to traffic following investigations by the Roads and Traffic Authority. As the road was the only alternative route to the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway between Gosford and Sydney, which itself was prone to congestion, local service station owner Jim Lloyd collected 60,000 signatures demanding the re-opening of the road. The cost of restoring the highway was estimated at A$2.3 million in May 1993. The road was eventually re-opened in June 1994, and in the 1996 federal elections, Jim Lloyd was elected to represent the Division of Robertson within which Cheero Point is located.

It is part of the local government area. The suburb is serviced by a small shopping centre, Paringa Mall, and the Davistown RSL. It is populated mostly by young families and elderly retirees. In recent years, much of the dilapidated housing in the area, built mostly within the 1950s through to the 1980s has undergone purchasing by wealthier individuals who are rebuilding new homes. History It is named for the Davis family which settled in the area after migrating from Northern Ireland. The sons of the family established a series of successful ship building firms in the second half of the 19th century and the areas name was taken from the nickname of 'Davistown'. The most successful of the shipwrights were the brothers Thomas, Rock and Edward Davis. Rock was born at sea aboard the Mary Catherine. Rock is named after the captain of the ship, Rock Jones. Between 1869 and 1879, Ben Davis built an estimated 34 vessels at Davistown, and a further 15 at Bensville. Rock Davis built 8 vessels here between 1854 and 1862, and later moved to Blackwall (near Woy Woy), where he built at least 160 vessels between 1863 and 1904. Another local shipbuilder Alfred W.R.M. Settree built 7 vessels at Davistown, including Day Dawn, Edith Keep and Dewdrop, between 1869 and 1879. Giles Jenkins built 10 vessels, mostly ketches, at Davistown between 1876 and 1889. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 2,488 people in Davistown. 83.6% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 4.5%. 93.8% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion in Davistown were Anglican 29.1%, No Religion 25.0% and Catholic 24.0%.

It is part of the local government area, and occupies an area previously inhabited by the Guringai (Wanangine) People. East Gosford is named after the Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford, with whom New South Wales Governor George Gipps served in Canada. Archibald Acheson was appointed Governor of British North America in 1835, and conducted a royal commission into the state of affairs in Lower Canada. At the 2016 census East Gosford had a population of 4,238 people. East Gosford Aerial View  History  Point Frederick are in the background. The site where East Gosford now stands changed hands twice before being sold to Samuel Peek, a Sydney tea merchant. East Gosford was surveyed in 1841 and within a year, began to develop, when Peek began to sell land there. A wharf and several shops were built. After building a three story hotel, Peek and his family went to England in 1850. Returning in 1857, their ship wrecked near the Gap, and all family members perished. Many of his private papers were lost in the wreck, and he left no heirs, so many of his buildings decayed with bricks, doors and woodwork disappearing.Swancott, 1984, p5 In 1858 a small sandstone church was built and was centrally located for parishioners from Erina, Gosford and Terrigal. However, when the railway was opened, more people began to live closer to Gosford. The church became unused and so it was decided to move the church, stone-by-stone to Mann Street, Gosford where it is still located. Located on the eastern border of East Gosford is Erina Creek. Originally the creek provided access to the many ketches and steamers which came in and out on timber business. A man operating a punt carried people and their goods across Erina Creek. In 1884 the Government called tenders for the construction of an iron drawbridge with timber approaches. On 15 September, the tender of John Johnstone was accepted and work began. The bridge was completed in 1886, probably early in the year, at a cost of ¬£3,695/15/-, which was considerably more than the average cost of ¬£500 for country bridges. Part of the bridge rolled back towards the Gosford side by means of wheels guided on rails. This was achieved by men cranking the mechanism by hand. The bridge was opened seven times a day. The last of the steamers to go through was the Lone Pine in 1928.Dundon, 1980, p84 The old Punt Bridge, as it was called, was replaced by a modern bridge built by Beattie and Frost Pty Ltd of Gosford in 1962.Dundon, 1980, p85 It is still known as The Punt Bridge and forms part of the Central Coast Highway. In 1913 two sisters, the Misses Marion and Aileen Macabe, opened a school for girls at Boomera, later known as Hinemoa Private Hospital in Masons Parade, Gosford. Some years later the expanded school was moved into Mona Vale built by William Rogers. Completed in 1889, this residence now forms part of St. Edward's College. The property on which Mona Vale was built was part of an original crown grant to surveyor William Shone in 1844. Subsequent owners were Charles Venteman, James Harrison and William Tyrrell, Bishop of Newcastle. It was Tyrrell's death in 1879 which led to the subdivision and public auction of the property. A portion was bought by William Rogers for ¬£490. He demolished an earlier house on the land when he built Mona Vale.Dundon, 1980, p92 The school took boarders and day students (the latter included a few small boys), and offered a very wide range of subjects. Extras such as Esperanto, elocution, dancing and music could be undertaken and popular sports were swimming, rowing and tennis. Gosford livery stable owner Mr Sam Ranyard assisted Miss Aileen Maccabe in giving horse- riding instructions and also supplied horses. In 1923 the MacCabe sisters were faced with overcrowding problems and moved their school to Lindfield, where it was known as Marshall Mount.Dundon, 1980, p93 Negotiations began in 1951 between the Christian Brothers and Mr W. Rogers for the purchase of Mona Vale and adjacent land. St. Edward's College construction started in 1952 and Mona Vale was restored. In the 1970s the old house again underwent restoration and was used as a staffroom and administration centre for the college until 2005.Dundon, 1980, p93 There are currently four schools in East Gosford. St. Patrick's, a Catholic school and Gosford East Public School both cater for boys and girls from kindergarten to year six. St. Edward's Christian Brothers College, a Catholic boys' school, and St. Joseph's Catholic College, a girls' school, both cater for students from years seven to twelve. Gosford Regional Gallery and Gosford/Edogawa Commemorative Garden are located in East Gosford. The Commemorative Garden is a Japanese garden that was built as a gift to residents of Gosford City Council by the Ward of Edogawa, Tokyo, Japan. They were opened in September 1994. In the past East Gosford had branches for all four major banks, however these had been progressively closed by 2000. As a result, the Chamber of Commerce sought to open a Bendigo Bank Community branch. The branch was opened on 5 August 2000. The branch has been credited with a turnaround in retail trading in East Gosford. The East Gosford Community Bank has now expanded and operates a second branch at Lisarow and an agency at Kincumber. In 2004 a Pedestrian Bridge over York Street was opened to make it safer for children at East Gosford's four schools to cross. The road was identified in 2002 as the section most in need of a bridge in 2002 in a Roads and Traffic Authority report. The bridge cost $2.5 million to build and included two lifts for disabled access. It is funded by advertising on roadside panels throughout the Gosford local government area. The Government was criticised during construction as the opening appeared to be delayed so that it could be opened by the local state member. On 9 August 2006 the main road through East Gosford was designated the Central Coast Highway to guide motorists unfamiliar with the region.

Cuban artists embraced European modernism, and the early part of the 20th century saw a growth in Cuban avant-garde movements, which were characterized by the mixing of modern artistic genres. Some of the more celebrated 20th-century Cuban artists include Amelia Pel√°ez (1896‚Äì1968), best known for a series of mural projects, and painter Wifredo Lam (December 8, 1902‚ÄìSeptember 11, 1982), who created a highly personal version of modern primitivism. The Cuban born painter Federico Beltran Masses (1885‚Äì1949), was renowned as a colourist whose seductive portrayals of women sometimes made overt references to the tropical settings of his childhood. In Centro Habana, a small neighborhood of artists have transformed the walls around them. October 2002 Better known internationally is the work of photographer Alberto Korda, whose photographs following the early days of the Cuban Revolution included a picture of Che Guevara which was to become one of the most recognizable images of the 20th century. There is a flourishing street art movement influenced by Latin American artists Jos√© Guadalupe Posada and the muralist Diego Rivera. After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, some artists felt it was in their best interests to leave Cuba and produce their art, while others stayed behind, either happy or merely content to be creating art in Cuba, which was sponsored by the government. Because it was state sponsored, an implied censorship occurred, since artists wouldn't want to make art that was against the revolutionary movement as that was the source of their funding. It was during the 1980s in which art began to reflect true uninfluenced expression. The \\"rebirth\\" of expression in Cuban art was greatly affected by the emergence of a new generation of Cuban, which did not remember the revolution directly.Padura Fuentes, Leonardo. \\"Living and Creating in Cuba: Risks and Challenges\\".

Colonial Era Throughout most of its 400 years under Spanish rule, Cuba and specifically Havana functioned as the primary entrep√¥t of Spain's empire in the Americas, with a population of merchants, administrators, and professionals who were interested in supporting the arts. In the 16th century painters and sculptors began arriving from Europe to decorate Cuban churches and public buildings. By the mid 1700s, native-born artists working in the European tradition were active in Cuba. Yeyo Yeyo, Jos√© Nicol√°s de Escalera, ca. 1770. Collection of the National Museum of Fine Art, Havana. The first of these to leave a substantial, identifiable body of work was Jos√© Nicol√°s de la Escalera (1734 ‚Äì 1804). Though mostly absent of originality, his religious scenes - particularly those decorating the cupola and altar of the Church of Santa Mar√≠a del Rosario near Havana - are spectacular, and include the first fine art depictions of Black Cuban slaves.Cernuda Arte: Jos√© Nicol√°s de la Escalera; http://www.cernudaarte.com/artists/jose-nicolas-de-la-escalera/ retvd 2 6 16 Vicente Escobar (1762 - 1834) was a mestizo whose skill as a portraitist made him popular among Cuba's elite.Art Experts; Vicente Escobar y de Flores (1762-1834); http://www.artexpertswebsite.com/pages/artists/escobarydeflores.php; retvd 1 31 16 Though having no formal art education himself, he opened what was possibly Cuba's first painting workshop/studio, and later graduated with honors from the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid.

However, the success of Toussaint and Dessalines' slave uprising spread intense anxiety throughout the Caribbean, and one response to it was the growth of costumbrismo - realist yet romanticized views of day-to- day life - in Cuban art. Tipos y Costumbres de la Isla de Cuba, Victor Patricio Landaluze, 1881. A leading early artist in this genre was Spanish- born V√≠ctor Patricio de Landaluze (1830 - 1889), whose paintings depicted plantation life as rough but essentially natural and harmonious. His political cartoons for the magazine El Almendares took a more satirical view of the urbanized \\"Creole aristocracy\\". Opposed to Cuban independence, Landaluze eventually fell out of favor with the public, but his work remains valued for capturing the atmosphere and attitudes of his time.Cernuda Arte: V√≠ctor Patricio Landaluze http://www.cernudaarte.com/artists/victor-patricio- landaluze/; retvd 1 31 16 On January 11, 1818, the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes (known as the \\"Academy San Alejandro\\", in honor of an important founder/benefactor) was established in Havana, under the direction of Frenchman Jean Baptiste Vermay (1786 - 1833). The oldest art academy in Latin America, it is the second oldest institution of higher education in Cuba, after the University of Havana. Continuing to the present day, it has produced many of Cuba's most important artists.EcuRed: School of Fine Arts San Alejandro; https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl;=es&u;=http://www.ecured.cu/Escuela_de_Artes_Pl%25C3%25A1sticas_San_Alejandro&prev;=search retvd 2 6 16 By the later 19th century landscape painting had become popular, with artists such as Miguel Arias Bardou, Guillermo Collazo, Jos√© Abreu Morell, and Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Tejada creating scenes featuring Cuba's lush natural environment. Despite the benign content of their work, many artists (perhaps most prominently, Collazo) were strong supporters of Cuban independence, and some were forced into exile. In 1898 Spain's four centuries of rule over Cuba came to an end when U.S. troops intervened on the side of rebel fighters. Independence, however, proved illusory, with the United States controlling Cuba's foreign policy and much of its economy,U.S. Dep't of State-Office of the Historian; The United States, Cuba, and the Platt Amendment, 1901; https://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/platt retvd 2 6 16 while strong-man presidents did little to foster freedom and democracy. Artists of the early Republican era continued much as before, painting landscapes and scenes of Cuban life in the traditional European style, some of them showing light touches of Impressionism. Many, such as Antonio Sanchez Araujo, Armando Menocal, Antonio Rodriguez Morey, Domingo Ramos Enriquez, and Leopoldo Roma√±ach, went on to become instructors or administrators at the Academy San Alejandro and other arts institutions. The Modernist movements which convulsed European art early in the 20th century initially had little impact on the closed, academic world of contemporary Cuban art. Vanguardia artists In the late 19th century, landscapes dominated Cuban art and classicism was still the preferred genre.Cuban Culture . The radical artistic movements that transformed European art in the first decades of the century arrived in Latin America in the 1920s to form part of a vigorous current of artistic, cultural, and social innovation. ¬øQuiere Mas Caf√© Don Nicolas?, Antonio Gattorno, ca. 1938. By the late 1920s, the Vanguardia artists had rejected the conventions of Cuba's national art academy, the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes ‚ÄúSan Alejandro‚Äù, in Havana, which most of them had attended. In their formative years, many had lived in Paris, where they studied and absorbed the tenets of Surrealism, Cubism, and modernist Primitivism. Modernism burst on the Cuban scene as part of the critical movement of national regeneration that arose in opposition to the dictatorship of Gerardo Machado, American neo-colonial control, and the consequent economic crisis.Ades, Dawn. Art in Latin America: The Modern Era, 1820-1980\\\\. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1989: 7. They returned to Cuba committed to new artistic innovation and keen to embrace the heritage of their island. These artists became increasingly political in their ideology, viewing the rural poor as symbols of national identity in contrast to the ruling elite of post independence Cuba. Vanguard leader Eduardo Abela, a painter who studied in Paris, was typical of the movement. He discovered his homeland Cuba from abroad, apparently motivated by a combination of distance and nostalgia. On his return, Abela entered a highly productive period of work. His murals of Cuban life were complemented by cartoons which became social critiques of Cuban life under the authoritarian Machado regime.Eduardo Abela Cubanet La Gitana Tropical, 1929, by V√≠ctor Manuel. Pioneers of the movement included Abela, Antonio Gattorno, Victor Manuel, Fidelio Ponce de Le√≥n, and Carlos Enr√≠quez G√≥mez. Born around the turn of the century, these artists grew up amidst the turmoil of constructing a new nation, and reached maturity when Cubans were engaged in discovering and inventing a national identity. They fully shared in the sense of confidence, renovation, and nationalism that characterized Cuban progressive intellectuals in the second quarter of the twentieth century. Antonio Gattorno (1904 - 1980) and Eduardo Abela (1889 - 1965) were the earliest painters of their generation to adapt modern European and Mexican art to the interpretation of their Cuban subjects. They also found in the directness and idealization of early Renaissance painting an effective model for their expression of Cuban themes. These painters' criollo images, for all their differences, shared a modern primitivist view of Cuba as an exotic, timeless, rural land inhabited by simple and sensual, if also sad and melancholic people. Although rooted in Cuba's natural and cultural environment, the vision of lo cubano (the Cuban) was far removed from contemporary historical reality. Instead it was based on an ideal conception of patria that had been a component of Cuban nationalism and art since the nineteenth century. This idealized vision featured strongly in the portraits and landscapes of Victor Manuel (1897 - 1969), who was particularly impressed by the works of Paul C√©zanne and Paul Gauguin during his two relatively brief stays in Paris. A San Alejandro graduate highly skilled in drawing and composition, Manuel chose to apply primitivist simplicity to his Cuban subjects - a favorite being the female face - and brought out qualities of melancholy and strength, as captured in La Gitana Tropical (The Tropical Gipsy, 1929), which is considered by critics to be one of the defining pieces of Cuban Avant-garde art.Cernuda Art: Victor Manuel Garcia; http://www.cernudaarte.com/artists/victor-manuel-garcia/ retvd 12 9 15 The emphasis which Carlos Enr√≠quez (1900 - 1957) and Fidelio Ponce (1895 - 1949) placed on the themes of change, transformation, and death have had an enduring impact on Cuban art.Cruz-Taura, Graciella; Fuentes-Perez, Ileana; Pau-Llosa, Ricardo. Outside Cuba. New Jersey: Office of Hispanic Arts Mason Gross School of the Arts, 1988: 44. Enr√≠quez and Ponce represent two approaches to death: the first marked by exuberant flight and emotion; the second by moody contemplation. If Enr√≠quez painted the delirium after the triumphed siege, Ponce painted the anteroom of grief. Enriquez was a self- taught painter from a wealthy family, while Ponce, though he had attended the San Alejandro Academy, spent his life in poverty. What these two most original and distinctive of the vanguardia painters had in common - aside from severe problems with alcoholism - was the fact that neither had studied in Europe.Martinez, Juan A.;Cuban Art & National Identity: The Vanguardia Painters, 1927-1950; University Press of Florida, 1994; Early in 1927, solo exhibitions were held for Victor Manuel and Antonio Gattorno at Havana's Association of Painters and Sculptors, followed in May by the First Exposition of New Art, a group show featuring mostly Cuban modernists. Trumpeted by the avant-garde journal Revista de Avance, these well-received shows were important strides towards the acceptance of modern art in Cuba. The masters of the first generation of Cuban modernism set the stage for the prevalence of certain themes that would govern Cuban art after 1930, and which would have varying degrees of impact on those generations that would later emerge entirely in exile after 1960. Between 1934 and 1940, and still reeling from the overthrow of Machado, Cuba was searching for its cultural identity in its European and African roots. The landscape, flora, fauna, and lore of the island, as well as its peasants - the often neglected foundation of Cuba's soul and economy - emerged in its art.Cruz-Taura, Graciella; Fuentes-Perez, Ileana; Pau-Llosa, Ricardo. Outside Cuba. New Jersey: Office of Hispanic Arts Mason Gross School of the Arts, 1988: 44. Wifredo Lam (1902 - 1982), a Cuban of Chinese, Spanish, and African ancestry, had little direct involvement with the Havana vanguardia, but was of the same generation and had similar motivations and experiences with his art. After attending the San Alejandro Academy, he initially took the more traditional route of studying in Madrid, and lived and worked in Spain for many years. After serving in the Spanish Civil War, he fled to Paris, where he came under the wing of Pablo Picasso, who kindled Lam's interest in African sculpture. Lam also befriended the Surrealist poet/philosopher Andr√© Breton. Returning to Cuba in 1941 after two decades abroad, Lam was enchanted, dismayed, and powerfully inspired by his homeland. He rapidly developed his mature style, which incorporated elements of Cubism, Surrealism, and African art, along with imagery of the Santeria rituals he'd grown up around. In 1943 he painted The Jungle, which is considered to be among the masterpieces of Cuban art.Sims, Lowery Stokes; Wifredo Lam and the International Avant-Garde, 1923-1982; University of Texas Press, 2002; Poupeye, Veerle; Caribbean Art; Thames and Hudson Ltd., London, 1998; Amelia Pel√°ez (1896 - 1968) was the sole major female artist of the vanguardia. A San Alejandro graduate, she studied and worked for several years in Paris, where, prior to her return to Havana in 1934, she absorbed the influence of Henri Matisse and, especially, the Cubism of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. During her long career she worked in a variety of media, including paint, pottery, and mosaic, and explored a variety of subjects and themes, but whether creating her abstracted still life paintings or her famed large scale public murals, her work consistently employed vivid color and elaborate composition, as well as representations of Cuba's tropical flora and Havana's ubiquitous Spanish Colonial architectural motifs. For all its colorful energy, however, French critic Francis de Miomandre sensed in her work \\"a closed, completely enigmatic world, haunted by an enigmatic silence.\\" She, Lam, and Enriquez have come to be considered Cuban art's most distinctive and definitive stylists.Cubanet-artist biography:Amelia Pelaez; http://www.cubanet.org/htdocs/lee/amelia.html retvd 12 18 15 Untitled painting, 1947, Amelia Pel√°ez. By 1935 the vanguardia were recognized in Cuba as an important cultural force, and began to gain considerable notice internationally. Major exhibitions of Cuban modern art were held in the United States and throughout Latin America in the late 1930s and 40s. Wrote Albert H. Barr, Jr., organizer of the Cuban Modern Painting exhibition at New York's Museum of Modern Art in 1944, \\"We may be grateful for that reckless exuberance, gaiety, candor, and love of life which the Cuban painters show perhaps more than the artists of any other school.\\" Modern Cuban art was at last seen in Paris, France, in an exhibition at the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne in 1951. The artists themselves saw little material benefit from the growth of interest in modern Cuban art. Occasional purchase awards were doled out, as at the First National Salon of Painting and Sculpture in 1935, but there was no consistent system of patronage, and commissions for Cuba's avant- gardists were rare. Most subsisted on low-paying teaching jobs and commercial work; a few, such as Enriquez and Pelaez, had means of support via their families, and some, such as Ponce and Manuel, lived in poverty. The only one of them to eventually command high prices for his work while still living was Wifredo Lam. Other notable artists of the original vanguardia were Jorge Arche, Marcelo Pogolotti, Aristides Fernandez, Rafael Blanco, Domingo Ravenet, Alberto Pe√±a, and Lorenzo Romero Arciaga. The Second National Salon of Painting and Sculpture in 1938 brought to the fore a second generation of modern artists which included Cundo Bermudez, Mario Carre√±o, Rita Longa, Alfredo Lozano, Luis Martinez-Pedro, and Ren√© Portocarrero By the late 1940s the first generation of vanguard artists had dispersed, pursuing their individual careers. Lam went on to great success, living mainly in Paris after 1952. Arche, Fernandez, and Pe√±a died young; Enriquez and Ponce both achieved some international recognition before dying in middle-age. Others, such as Gattorno and Pogolotti, left Cuba and took their art in entirely new directions; still more emigrated after the Cuban Revolution of 1959, which left Cuban artists isolated from art developments and markets in the United States and Europe. Several, such as Pelaez, Abela, and Manuel, continued to produce work in Cuba. The vanguardia artists received international recognition in 2003 with the Modern Cuban Painting exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, subsequently shown in Paris.Cuban Art and National Identity: The Vanguardia Painters Juan A. Mart√≠nez Modern Cuban artists continue to do significant work in this tradition, including Juan Ram√≥n Vald√©s G√≥mez (called Yiki) and Jos√© Toirac.

Artists who work in this style are generally acknowledged as favoring a more \\"primitive\\" or \\"folk\\" style of art.Mouial, G√©rald. \\"Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Na√Øve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive‚Ä¶\\" Ciudad de la Habana: Artecubano; National Council of the Visual Arts of Cuba. 2004: 15. The term na√Øve itself can be problematic; usually meaning an artist is self-taught, it has been used in the past by academic artists or critics as a derogatory term, since na√Øve artists tend to ignore the basic rules of art. In spite of their disregard for academic conventions, na√Øve artists are often quite sophisticated in their personal forms of artistic expression. The colors used in Cuban na√Øve art are especially vivid, with artists using the vibrant hues of their tropical home to present an idealized view of rural life, with spiritual references to Catholicism and Santeria's Orichas (deities), legends, and other aspects of Afro-Cuban culture, past and present. This na√Øve style of art portrays the typical Cuban worldview of the enjoyment of life despite its hardshipsNa√Øve Art from Cuba. New York, NY: Center for Cuban Studies. 1997. In the 1950s, American tourism in Cuba created great demand for folkloric and picturesque art, leading to increased production of what came to be known as \\"tourist art\\", most of which was classified as na√Øve.Mouial, G√©rald. \\"Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Na√Øve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive‚Ä¶\\" Ciudad de la Habana: Artecubano; National Council of the Visual Arts of Cuba. 2004: 9 At the time this art was seen as a \\"backward, barbaric, and crude form of expression that must be swept away,\\" rather than an authentic representation of a living culture.Fure, Rogelio Martinez. \\"Afrocuba: An Anthology of Cuban Writing on Race, Politics and Culture\\". Ed. Sarduy, Pedro Perez, and Jean Stubbs. Melbourne: Ocean Press. 1993: 104. After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, educational, cultural, and artistic activities were encouraged, with artists able to attend the nation's free-access art schools (Escuelas Nacionales de Arte‚Äînow known as Instituto Superior de Arte). Even so, whether due to physical isolation or disinterest in the world of academic painting, there remained a large number of self-taught Ingenuous or Spontaneous painters. Many of these artists joined together to form the Movement of Popular Artists in the early 1960s. Although this and other co- operative efforts waned over the following decades, the artists themselves continued to paint.Mouial, G√©rald. \\"Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Na√Øve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive‚Ä¶\\" Ciudad de la Habana: Artecubano; National Council of the Visual Arts of Cuba. 2004: 9. Due to Cuban national pride in academic achievement and artistic training, it had been considered demeaning to be called a na√Øve artist in the early years after the Revolution. Since na√Øve artists were not generally recognized by the government as professional artists, they were not taken seriously by the arts community at large, and were at times harassed, their art sales being claimed illegal activity by the Cuban government.Mouial, G√©rald. \\"Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Na√Øve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive‚Ä¶\\". Ciudad de la Habana: Artecubano; National Council of the Visual Arts of Cuba. 2004: 9. In the late 20th century, however, this attitude began to change. In 1997, Sandra Levinson, executive director of the Center for Cuban Studies Art Space in New York City, organized Na√Øve Art in Cuba, a first-of-its-kind exhibition at the Metropolitan Arts Center featuring the art of fourteen Cuban na√Øve artists, in addition to the eight members of the Grupo Bayate artist's collective from Mella, Santiago de Cuba. These artists were discovered during a 1996 trip to Cuba by Levinson, Olga Hirshhorn, and others, who crisscrossed the island searching for examples of this style of art, of which so little had previously been seen in the United StatesNa√Øve Art from Cuba. New York, NY: Center for Cuban Studies. 1997. The unofficial head of Grupo Bayate is Luis Rodr√≠guez Arias (born 1950), a baker by profession. He is known as el maestro to differentiate him from his son, artist Luis Rodr√≠guez Ricardo (born 1966), who calls himself el estudiante. Both were represented in the Na√Øve Art from Cuba exhibition, which ran from September 11 to October 10, 1997. Na√Øve Art from Cuba. New York, NY: Center for Cuban Studies. 1997. Luis El estudiante Rodriguez is among the most prominent Cuban Na√Øve painters. He began painting at eighteen years of age; he has described his first painting, of a girlfriend's home, as \\"horrible\\".Mouial, G√©rald. \\"Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Na√Øve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive‚Ä¶\\" Ciudad de la Habana: Artecubano; National Council of the Visual Arts of Cuba. 2004: 178. After serving in the army and working in construction, he was assigned to farm labor during Cuba's \\"special period\\". In those years he began to work with sculpture as a way to supplement his income, turning to painting a few years later.Mouial, G√©rald. \\"Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Na√Øve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive\\". Ciudad de la Habana: Artecubano; National Council of the Visual Arts of Cuba. 2004: 179. Like most na√Øve artists, he finds inspiration for his work in the experiences of his daily life: religious rituals and the events and people of his community. Having grown up in a neighborhood of mostly Haitian families, he is well aware of their struggles; he sometimes describes his work as \\"polemic\\".Mouial, G√©rald. \\"Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Na√Øve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive\\". Ciudad de la Habana: Artecubano; National Council of the Visual Arts of Cuba. 2004: 179.In January 1997, el estudiante held a one-man show in Santiago de Cuba's largest and most prestigious gallery, Oriente, and continues to take part in exhibitions held by Grupo Bayate. In June, 2002 his work was described as \\"riotously colorful and stacked like a rush-hour train\\" in a New York Times article entitled \\"Ebullient Cubans Make a Lot Out of a Little\\",Grant, Annette. \\"Art/Architecture; Ebullient Cubans make a Lot Out of a Little\\". The New York Times (2000): 35. Academic Search Complete: 2. which also speaks of the art- market success of his na√Øve style. Another artist featured in the 1997 Metropolitan Arts Center Na√Øve Art from Cuba exhibition was Juli√°n Espinoza Rebollido, also known as Wayac√≥n. Born in 1931 (although his birth was not registered until 1941, making him \\"officially\\" 10 years younger than he actually is), Wayac√≥n began painting as a child. Attending school only through the 3rd grade, this self-taught artist supported himself as a builder, auditing courses at the Cuban academy when he was older. In the 1950s he joined the Signos artists' group, and participated in his first exhibitions in Japan and Switzerland.Mouial, G√©rald. \\"Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Na√Øve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive‚Ä¶\\".

Although an admirer of Mir√≥, Chagall, Degas, and Picasso, his greatest inspirations come from observing the practice of the Santeria religion.Mouial, G√©rald. \\"Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Na√Øve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive‚Ä¶\\".

Many of his paintings show its influence, containing vivid colors and religious imagery, with an almost hallucinogenic quality. Na√Øve Art from Cuba. New York, NY: Center for Cuban Studies. 1997. The foremost na√Øve artist in Cuba is Jos√© Rodr√≠guez Fuster, known as Fuster. In addition to his paintings and drawings, he has over the years transformed the poor suburb of Jaimanitas, Havana, into a magical, dreamlike streetscape, drawing on his expertise as a ceramist to create an environment evocative of Antoni Gaudi's famed Park G√ºell in Barcelona. There is a chess park, with giant boards and tables, houses individually decorated with ornate murals and domes, a riot of giant roosters, gauchos, Afro-Cuban religious figures installed by the entrance of many houses, a Fusterised theatre, public squares, and a large mural. The primitive-outsider art of Corso de Palenzuela (b. Havana, ca.1960), a self-taught painter of Sephardic ancestry, taps a rich lode of memory for its source material, depicted in a very personal Cuban landscape. Although he emigrated to the U.S. with his family at the age of eight, his colorfully vivid work places great emphasis on bringing out the rich cultural heritage of his native land.Gonzalez, David-\\"Striving to Capture Cultures and Beauty of Cuba\\", The New York Times, July 25, 1995 Although not technically a naive artist, Manuel Mendive is perhaps the single most important exponent of contemporary Afro-Cubanismo in the visual arts. Born in 1944 into a Santer√≠a-practicing family, he graduated from the prestigious Academia de Artes Pl√°sticas San Alejandro in Havana in 1962 with honors in sculpture and painting. Few na√Øve artists have been represented in either Contemporary Art Salons or the Biennial of Havana. However, with growing interest in the genre, there are, as of 2015, increasing numbers of academic artists who have begun to paint in this style, with greater representation for all.Mouial, G√©rald. \\"Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Na√Øve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive‚Ä¶\\" Ciudad de la Habana: Artecubano; National Council of the Visual Arts of Cuba. 2004: 180. Art in Post-Revolutionary Cuba In the 1960s the aftermath of the Cuban revolution brought new restrictions, causing an exodus of intellectuals and artists. The new r√©gime required \\"a practice of culture as ideological propaganda, along with a stereotyped nationalism\\". Mosquera, Geraldo. The New Cuban Art: Post Modernism and Postsocialist Condition. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003. 208-247, Print. Although government policies - driven by limited resources - did narrow artistic expression, they expanded, through education and subsidies, the number of people who could practice art, breaking down barriers through democratization and socialization. The increasing influence of the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s did impact Cuban culture, but the Cuban government did not match the U.S.S.R in its degree of control over the Arts.

Ch√© poster, 1968, designed by Alfredo Rostgaard, based on photograph by Alberto Korda. The poster was distributed in OSPAAAL's magazine Tricontinental. In the 1960s government agencies such as the Commission of Revolutionary Orientation (the publishing division of the Cuban Communist Party, later renamed Editora Politica (EP)) and OSPAAAL began churning out posters for propaganda purposes. Many of these used stereotypically Soviet design features, but even some early samples showed hints of the Cuban flair for colorful and inventive graphic design, and by the late 60s, Cuban graphic art was in its heyday. Though still essentially producing propaganda, artists such as Rene Mederos, Raul Martinez, Alfredo Rostgaard, and F√©lix Beltran were creating vivid, powerful, and highly distinctive works which had global influence on graphic design.Cushing, Lincoln; ¬°Revolucion!: Cuban Poster Art. Chronicle Books, 2003; Slanted Magazine #21:Cuba ‚Äì The New Generation, 2013 An image commonly used by Cuban graphic designers was \\"Guerillero Heroica\\", a photograph of Ch√© Guevara taken by Alberto Korda (b. Havana, 1928 ‚Äì d. Paris, 2001). The candid shot of a moody, exhausted Guevara, taken in March, 1960 at a memorial service for victims of an ammunition ship explosion in Havana Harbor, became one of the world's most iconic images. It was eventually altered and adapted for everything from gum wrappers to a 90 ft. tall commemorative iron sculpture in Havana's Plaza de la Revoluci√≥n. Korda was a popular fashion photographer who became a devoted revolutionary and close companion of Fidel Castro, taking thousands of shots of Castro's travels and Cuba's transformation.Havana Cultura - Visual Arts - Alberto Korda, photographer; http://havana- cultura.com/en/visual-arts/alberto-korda; retvd 3 12 16The Art History Archive - photography: Alberto Korda; http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/photography/Alberto-Korda.html; retvd 3 12 16 Cubans remained intent on reinforcing a Cuban identity rooted in its own culture, as exemplified by the work of Grupo Antillano.de la Fuente, Alejandro. Grupo Antillano: The Art of Afro-Cuba. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2013. The simultaneous assimilation or synthesis of the tenets of modern western art and the development of Afro-Cuban art schools and movements created a new Cuban culture. Art proliferated under state programs of sponsorship and employment during this post-revolutionary period; the programs both politicized artistic content and inspired confidence in the people within the framework of Cuba's reinvented nationalism. Nelson Dominguez and Roberto Fabelo went from Abstraction and Neoexpressionism of the 1950s, to immortalizing the proletariat, farmers, workers and soldiers, while continuing to utilize many of the techniques they learned under the tutelage of Antonia Eiriz V√°zquez. By combining nationalism with the politicization of art, artists maintained a level of freedom that continues to inspire innovation. The Sal√≥n de Mayo (May Salon) was an art exhibition held in Havana in July 1967. Organized by Carlos Franqui, it presented works by more than a hundred artists and represented rival schools of twentieth-century art: early modernists (Picasso, Miro, Magritte); the next generation (Lam, Calder, Jacques H√©rold, Stanley Hayter); and postwar (Asger Jorn, Antonio Saura, Jorge Soto. It represented the high point of artistic free expression in the decade following the revolution. The new art The 1960s and 1970s saw the introduction of conceptual art, shifting emphasis away from craftsmanship to ideas. This often meant the elimination of objects in art production; only ideas were stated or discussed. It required an enhanced level of participation by the patron (interactive participation or a set of instructions to follow). Conceptual art, Minimalism, Earth art, and Performance art mingled together to expand the very definition of Art.Morgan, Ann Lee. \\"Conceptual Art\\". The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists. Oxford: 2007. Oxford University Press. By the late 1970s, many of the graduates of the school of the arts in Cuba, \\"the Facultad de Artes Plasticas of the Instituto Superior de Arte\\" (founded in 1976) were going to work as schoolteachers, teaching art to young Cubans across the island. This provided a platform for the graduates to teach students about freedom of expression in medium, message, and style of art. It was this new level of experimentation and expression that was to enable the movement of the 1980s.Tonel, Antonio Eligio. \\"A Tree From Many Shores: Cuban Art in Movement\\". Art Journal. 57.4 (1998) 62-74\\\\. Print. In Cuba, these new developments were naturally synthesized through the Afro-Cuban sensibility and emerged as The New Art, an art movement widely recognized as distinctly Cuban. Young artists born after the revolution rebelled against modernism and embraced conceptual art, amongst other genres. Many would carry on folkloric traditions and Santeria motifs in their individual expressions while infusing their message with humor and mockery.Mosquera, Geraldo. The New Cuban Art: Post Modernism and Postsocialist Condition. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003. 208-247, Print. The art took a qualitative leap by creating international-art structured on African views, not from the outside like surrealism but from the inside, alive with the cultural-spiritual complexities of their own existence. The exhibition Volumen Uno, in 1981, wrenched open the doors for The New Art. Participants, many of whom were still in school, created a typical generational backlash by artists of the previous generation including Alberto Jorge Carol, Nelson Dominguez, and C√©sar Leal, who went on the attack against the upstarts. The group, Volumen Uno - made up of Jose Bedia, Lucy Lippard, Ana Mendieta, Ricardo Brey, Leandro Soto, Juan Francisco Elso, Flavio Garciandia, Gustavo Perez Monzon, Rubin Torres Llorea, Gory (Rogelio Lopez Marin), and Tomas Sanchez - presented a \\"fresh eclectic mix filtered through informalism, pop, minimalism, conceptualism, performance, graffiti and Arte Povera reconfigured and reactivated ‚Ä¶ to be critically, ethically, and organically Cuban\\".Weiss, Rachel. To and from Utopia in the New Cuban Art. London: University of Minnesota Press, 2011. This age of artist was dedicated to people who were willing to take risks in their art and truly express themselves, rather than to express only things that supported the political movement. While looking at art of the 1980s we see a trend in use of the shape of Cuba itself as inspiration for art. One piece, Immediately Geographic by artist Florencio Gelabert Soto, is a sculpture in the shape of Cuba, but is broken into many pieces. One interpretation could reflect the still unequal treatment towards artists, and the repression they were under. A movement that mirrored this artistic piece was underway in which the shape of Cuba became a token in the artwork in a phase known as \\"tokenization\\". This artwork often combined the shape of the island of Cuba with other attributes of the nation, such as the flag. By combining the various symbols of Cuba together the artists were proudly proclaiming 'this is who we are'. Some art critics and historians however will argue that this was partially due to the isolated nature of the island, and that use of the island in artwork represented a feeling of being alone; as with all art, the intention of the artist can have many interpretations.Fernandez, Antonio Eligio. \\"The Island, the Map, the Travelers: Notes on Recent Developments in Cuban Art\\". Boundary 2. 29.3 (2002) 77-90\\\\. Print. By the middle of the 1980s another group of artists sought a more explicit political responsibility to \\"revive the mess\\", \\"revive the confusion\\", as Aldo Menendez incorporated into his 1988 installation. Accompanying Men√©ndez's installation was a note: \\"As you can see, this work is almost blank. I could only start it due to the lack of materials. Please help me.\\" Here is the Cuban humor, the choteo, \\"perhaps the most quintessentially Cuban expression\\". Laughter became the antidote of an anarchistic energy for and from the revolution; \\"one moment an aggressive undertow, then a jester's provocation, pressuring the tensions\\", wrote Rachel Weiss in To and from Utopia in the New Cuban Art. \\"The choteo is allergic to authority and prestige, the enemy of order in all its manifestations‚Ä¶civil disenchantment, the incredulous and mocking inner nature of the Cuban rises to the surface.\\" The choteo, doing away with exactitude, tends to depict the extreme limits of an example. This sardonic Cuban humor has become as ubiquitous in Cuban art as the bright Caribbean colors of its palette. Eduardo Ponjuan, Glexis Novoa (of the ABTV group), Carlos Rodriguez Cardenas, Carlos Garaicoa, Rene Francisco and Enrique Silvestre are exemplars of this sensibility, mixing it with kitsch and harkening back in time while identifying with current Cuban attitudes, liberating art on the eve of the Cuban 'special period', in which the Soviet Union withdrew its financial aid. In 1990 the Cuban government began programs to stimulate the tourist trade as a means of offsetting the loss of Soviet support. In 1992 the constitution was amended to allow and protect foreign-owned property, and in 1993 the dollar was permitted to circulate legally. In 1994 a cabinet-level department was created, the Ministry of Tourism, to further enhance tourism, which is Cuba's largest source of income. The initial reaction of the artists, as well as the general population, was withdrawal; \\"Withdrawal from the public to the private‚Ä¶from the collective to the individual‚Ä¶from the epic to the mundane‚Ä¶from satire to metaphor...Withdrawal from controversy‚Ä¶withdrawal from confrontation\\". But it was the withdrawal from conceptual to figurative art that defined the change in painting. Due in large measure to the interest of tourists, art took on higher visibility, as well as returning to a more figurative mode of expression. Art also worked as a space where Cubans debated some of the social problems magnified by the \\"Special Period\\", as illustrated by the Queloides art project, which deals with issues of race and discrimination.de la Fuente, Alejandro. Queloides: Race and Racism in Cuban Contemporary Art. Pittsburgh: Mattress Factory, 2011. \\"Every Cuban is an artist and every home is an art gallery,\\" wrote Rachel Weiss in To and from Utopia in the New Cuban Art. Political influences in Cuban art \\"A question of major importance in Cuban culture is the link between radical political and artistic positions‚Ä¶where culture carries a marked social edge attuned to the circumstances in which it is produced and where it is forced to construct a national identity in the face of colonial and neo colonial powers.\\"Mosquera, Geraldo. The New Cuban Art: Post Modernism and Postsocialist Condition. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003. 208-247, Print. In the 1980s, when the New Cuban Art Movement was consolidating, many still hoped to establish the Third World utopia of social justice promised by the Cuban revolution. While Cuba shares many characteristics with other Latin American countries three factors guarantee it a unique placement amongst the formerly colonized countries of the Americas: * Spain continued emigration to Cuba in large numbers until the middle of the 20th century * The native population was eliminated in the 17th century * Cuba possesses the most varied cultural traditions of all the African diaspora in America \\"Although freedom of expression is nonexistent in Cuba, a certain amount of dissonance can be tolerated for recognized artists, at the right time and the right place, which basically means occasionally, in officially sanctioned (and controlled) venues, with very little (if any) spillover in the media. This keeps everybody on his or her toes, and creates a tension that is useful for the state. The global market seems to like its Cuban art with a dash of political irreverence, though many great works of Cuban artists sold abroad feature no obvious Cuban, Caribbean or Latin American style or content. Cuban artists are often masters of double entendre and detachment (parody, irony, sarcasm, and pastiche). The regime can afford to appear moderately open-minded since this kind of art is mostly inconsequential on the island. It can be censored when it appears to be crossing the line, perhaps leaving the artist free to present it abroad and to exhibit some other works at home.\\"Yvon Grenier, Culture and the Cuban State; Participation, Recognition, and Dissonance under Communism (Lexington Books, 2017) Religious influences in Cuban art In addition to the Christian, predominately Catholic, there are four African Religions continuing to influence culture being practiced in Cuba: Santeria (Yoruba), Palo Monte (Kongo), Regla Arara (Ewe Fon), and the secret, male only, Abakua (Calabar). The African religions operate independently and synthesized with each other and the Christian religions (syncretism). These unique views of reality form a core of practices, beliefs, and customs that has shaped a cultural distinction labeled Afro-Cuban and known as the dominate force in Cuban art; a transracial, \\"hybridized, inventive, and influential in the construction of contemporary [Cuban] culture\\".Mosquera, Geraldo.

It is part of the local government area. It is largely semi-rural, and is home to Central Coast Grammar School and a state primary school, as well as a shopping village consisting of a florist, hairdresser and several other specialty shops. Erina Heights also has a large population of bats. The local residents commonly refer to the area as \\"Bat Country\\". The bats can be most commonly seen upon dusk exiting the \\"Bat Cave\\". It is suggested that tourists equip themselves with a Bat Utility belt including Bat-Gas and a Batrang for personal protection. The local residents in close proximity to the Bat Cave ensure their windows and doors are closed upon dusk. The Bat-mobile can be frequently seen driving along Central Coast Highway or at the local IGA picking up milk or fresh produce from Erina Heights shops. It is rumoured that the fresh produce is used to subdue and feed the bats. Legend has it that if bitten by a bat you turn into a bush turkey. The bush turkeys are known to attack gardens and can only be stopped by chicken wire. The turkeys can often be seen wandering during the day, sometimes in pairs, and should be avoided. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 421 people in Erina Heights. 79.3% of people were born in Australia and 89.8% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion, so described 27.8% and Catholic 25.1%.

It is part of the local government area. Ettalong Beach is the natural eastward continuation of Umina Beach and Ocean Beach. The village is serviced by a small retail centre along Ocean View Road. The Mantra Ettalong Beach Resort (formerly operated by Outrigger) and Ettalong Beach War Memorial Club was completed in 2005. A \\"Fast Ferry\\" had been proposed from Ettalong to Circular Quay, Sydney. If it had been established, the service was expected to take only 40 minutes, compared to 1 hour 15 min for the train journey from neighbouring Woy Woy to Sydney. However, the company behind this idea became bankrupt in 2008, and the Fast Ferry Proposal was abandoned (https://web.archive.org/web/20091013062938/http://www.peninsulanews.asn.au/News/08/0211/Released.asp). The ferry service was approved by Gosford City Council and remains with an active development consent so that a future operator could commence ferry services to Sydney. The Rotary Club of Brisbane Water is based in Ettalong. One of the Central Coast's largest service clubs, members meet foughtnigtly at Ettalong Beach War Memorial Club. Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 4,793 people in Ettalong Beach. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.3% of the population. * 76.5% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 4.8% and New Zealand 2.3%. * 88.6% of people spoke only English at home. * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 27.6%, Catholic 25.6% and Anglican 24.1%. Local features Ettalong Beach in early 1900s. The Ettalong Beach retail centre is represented by the Peninsula Chamber of Commerce which is affiliated with the NSW Business Chamber. The Chamber successfully introduced the Peninsula Mainstreet Program in 1995 which instigated the heritage upgrade of the village centre. This led to the main street footpath paving and street landscaping which were undertaken through Gosford City Council's 1998 Financial Strategy resulting in the rejuvenation of the village. The main employers in the village are the Ettalong Beach Club, Mantra Resort, IGA Supermarket and Ettalong Beach Hotel. Ettalong Beach is also renowned for the Ettalong Beach Markets at the eastern end of Ocean View Road. The market complex also includes a range of restaurants and caf√©s together with the ornate Cinema Paradiso operated by a local family. Transport links Ettalong Beach is serviced by regular bus services (Busways) with connections to Woy Woy railway station, the Umina Beach retail centre, Kincumber and Erina Fair. The village is also serviced by the Palm Beach Ferry which connects the town to the north shore of Sydney and provides an important tourist route for visitors to the village and commuter link to the Northern Beaches. Brisbane Water Oyster Festival The Brisbane Water Oyster Festival is held annually in November, on The Esplanade and the foreshore reserve. The event attracts 20,000 people annually and is organised by the Peninsula Chamber of Commerce. The event showcases the local oyster industry which is one of the earliest marine industries in Brisbane Water. The first festival was originally held at Woy Woy in 2000 but quickly outgrew its venue and was relocated to Ettalong Beach in 2005. The highly successful community festival is run by a sub-committee of the Peninsula Chamber of Commerce and chaired from its inception by the Peninsula Mainstreet Co- ordinator Debra Wales. Foreshore upgrade The Ettalong Beach Foreshore Reserve upgrade was completed in early 2014 by Gosford City Council at a total cost of almost $5.4M including Federal funds of $2M. The works were a culmination of 15 years of lobbying by the Peninsula Chamber of Commerce for the upgrading of the foreshore and renourishment of Ettalong Beach. The upgraded foreshore includes children's play areas, barbecue facilities, cycle ways, landscaping and caf√©/restaurant overlooking the beach area. The cycle way links Ettalong Beach with Umina Beach to the south.

Early life Tornyai, the son of day labourers, studied at the School of Decorative Art in 1886-88, then a guest pupil of Bertalan Sz√©kely, K√°roly Lotz and J√°nos Greguss in 1888-89. He studied at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris from 1894 where he was influenced by Mih√°ly Munk√°csy's art. He visited Germany and Italy in 1897, then returned to H√≥dmez≈ëv√°s√°rhely. He had hardly enough to keep body and soul together, and had a studio from 1903 only. He started to collect folklore products together with and B√©la Endre and they founded a school in H√≥dmez≈ëv√°s√°rhely to save folk pottery. He lived in M√°rt√©ly from the 1910s onwards where he painted a series of landscapes on the Great Plain. He moved to Budapest in 1919. He worked in Szentendre for a few months in 1933‚Äì34.

In his late Szentendre period, colours became lighter and he was engaged in plein air (\\"Woman in Green Coat\\", 1932‚Äì34, etc.).This biography (partly) is from Fine Arts in Hungary, see http://www.hung-art.hu/index-en.html He became interested in the Great Plain around 1904 and from then on he made several pictures of farmsteads with violent brushwork and sweeping style.

It is an upstream cell signaling protein common to multicellular eukaryotes. The first tubby gene was identified in mice, and proteins that are homologous to tubby are known as \\"tubby-like proteins\\" (TULPs). They share a common and characteristic tertiary structure that consists of a beta barrel packed around an alpha helix in the central pore. The gene derives its name from its role in metabolism; mice with a mutated tubby gene develop delayed-onset obesity, sensorineural hearing loss and retinal degeneration. Structure Tubby proteins are classified as Œ±+Œ≤ proteins and have a 12-beta stranded barrel surrounding a central alpha helix. Tubby proteins can bind the small cell signaling molecule phosphatidylinositol, which is typically localized to the cell membrane. A similar structural fold to the Tubby like proteins has been identified in the Scramblase family of proteins. Function Tubby proteins have been implicated as transcription factors and as potential signaling factors coupled to G-protein activity. They are associated with neuronal differentiation and development, and in mammals are implicated in three disease processes when mutated: obesity, retinal degeneration, and hearing loss. In mice, mutations in tubby proteins are known to affect life span and fat storage as well as carbohydrate metabolism.

She was educated in Europe and New York City. She received a teaching credential and began teaching music in New York schools, using the Montessori method. In 1914, she helped to found the Walden School. In 1923, Claire Reis, who was, at the time an executive member of the board of the International Composers Guild, motivated several members to secede from that organization and founded the League of Composers. She then served as the league's president for twenty-five years. During this time she promoted many concerts and commissioned many works. One of her prot√©g√©s was Aaron Copland. Reis was a prolific author of many articles on music, two catalogs for the International Society for Contemporary Music, and the books Composers, Conductors and Critics and Composers in America: Biographical Sketches in 1938, a valuable reference work which appeared in a second, enlarged edition in 1947 and was republished in 1977). Reis served on the board of directors of the New York City Center of Music and Drama. She also helped to found the Women's City Club and was a member of the board of the Work Projects Administration. She was on the advisory board for music of the 1939 World's Fair. In 1969, Reis was awarded the Handel Medallion by the City of New York for her contributions to the city's cultural life.

The name Snƒõ≈æn√≠k or ≈önie≈ºnik derives from the word for \\"snow\\"; the mountain has snow cover for up to eight months a year. In Czech the adjective Kr√°lick√Ω (from the nearby town of Kr√°l√≠ky) is added to distinguish it from the mountain called Dƒõƒç√≠nsk√Ω Snƒõ≈æn√≠k (near the town of Dƒõƒç√≠n). An alternative Polish name is ≈önie≈ºnik K≈Çodzki, from the town of K≈Çodzko. In German the mountain is known as Glatzer Schneeberg (from Glatz, the German name for K≈Çodzko), Grulicher Schneeberg (from Gruhlich, the German name for Kr√°l√≠ky), or Spieglitzer Schneeberg (from Spieglitz, which is now part of Star√© Mƒõsto). The mountain is the highest peak of the ≈önie≈ºnik massif (called Kr√°lick√Ω Snƒõ≈æn√≠k in Czech, Masyw ≈önie≈ºnika in Polish, Glatzer Schneegebirge in German). It lies between the town Kr√°l√≠ky and the K≈Çodzko Gap that separates it from the Golden Mountains. The massive was formed during the Tertiary. Snƒõ≈æn√≠k lies on the water divide for the Black Sea (the Morava) and the Baltic Sea (the Nysa K≈Çodzka). Klep√°ƒç, the water divide for the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the North Sea (the Lipkovsk√Ω Stream) lies south of Snƒõ≈æn√≠k. Between 1899 and 1973 a stone view-tower stood on the Silesian side of the mountain top. A statue of a young elephant was put in place of a former chalet.

History Originally the station operated as WJHR (\\"Jersey Hometown Radio\\") with an adult contemporary format. It briefly broadcast a talk format called \\"Chat Radio\\" and had short stints as a business talk station and an ESPN Radio affiliate before adopting the call letters and religious format of WCHR, which had been operating on 920 AM in Trenton, in 2002. On January 3, 2008, Nassau Broadcasting Partners announced that 1040 would drop the religious format and switch to a full-time simulcast of New York City's WEPN. Nassau moved the religious programming and the WCHR call sign back to 920, which had been broadcasting as a Philadelphia-oriented ESPN Radio affiliate under the call letters WPHY. On February 5, 2008, the station took the WNJE call sign. On May 21, 2012 WNJE ended the simulcast of WEPN and joined ESPN Deportes Radio; this came in advance of WEPN's own switch to ESPN Deportes Radio in September, after ESPN Radio took over the operations of WEPN-FM in April. WNJE, along with nine other Nassau stations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, was purchased at bankruptcy auction by NB Broadcasting in May 2012. NB Broadcasting is controlled by Nassau's creditors ‚Äî Goldman Sachs, Pluss Enterprises, and P.E. Capital. In November, NB Broadcasting filed a motion to assign its rights to the stations to Connoisseur Media. On December 3, 2012 WNJE dropped ESPN Deportes Radio and began simulcasting the religious format of sister station WCHR 920. The sale to Connoisseur Media, at a price of $38.7 million, was consummated on May 29, 2013. On November 13, 2013 the simulcast of the religious format ended, and the Christian programming was subsequently heard only on 1040 as 920 adopted a secular talk format. The WCHR call sign was once again moved to 1040, and 920 became WNJE.

It forms part of the local government area. Forresters Beach is well known for its reef breaks to surfers. The name \\"Forresters Beach\\" comes from Robert Forrester who purchased of land in 1861.  Population  In the 2016 Census, there were 2,900 people in Forresters Beach. 82.5% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 4.8%. 92.1% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 30.8%, Catholic 25.0% and Anglican 20.7%.  Retirement Village  The Glen Group sought to purchase land in 2004 to build a large Retirement Village at Forresters Beach. This was disputed largely by local residents who felt that with the new village there would be an increase in population density and the \\"isolation\\" of the area would become endangered. Local residents went to the local council in an attempt to block the development of the land, this however failed and the village was built. In 2006 the village became open for retirees to move in. The Village took the place of Forresters Beach Fun Park which throughout the years had been home to Forresters Beach Bowling Alley, Waterslides, Maze, Bungey Jumping, Go-Karts and home of the Forresters Beach Markets, which were popular in the 1990s. The Putt Putt and Swingers 9 Hole golf course no longer remain in the area. Wyrrabalong National Park The park covers 597 ha but is divided into two separate areas. Wyrrabalong, meaning 'headland looking over the sea' is a word of the Darkinjung people who once occupied the narrow strip of coastline between Forresters Beach and Bateau Bay, which now constitutes the southern section of the park (140 ha). The southern section is characterised by high, exposed coastal cliffs of sandstone and shale and extensive rock platforms at either end that are ideal for fishing and exploring at low tide. There are woodlands of blackbutt, spotted gum and bloodwood along the plateau, with shrubs and heath (mostly coastal banksia and she-oak) on the gentler slopes to the west. Marine and bird life are abundant in the area. Fauna includes goannas, bandicoots, fantails and the tawny frogmouth. Wyrrabalong Lookout is located on Cromarty Hill. There is a car park and an adjacent concrete platform with views to the south and west. This site is also the major TV tower translator for the Wyong area, broadcasting as far as Yarramalong. A short path leads to Wyrrabalong Lookout on the cliff's edge, 132 m above sea-level, from where there are views south to The Skillion. A 1.6 km walking track leads along the cliffs through the attractive woodland to the other viewing platform, Crackneck Lookout (95 m high) where there is a large clearing and car park with information boards and a picnic-barbecue area.

Works Moxham's first book was The Freelander, a novel based on the exploits of a group of idealists trying to establish a commune on Mount Kenya in the 1890s. His best-known book is The Great Hedge of India. This book is part-travelogue, part-historical treatise on the author's quest to find a 1500-mile long customs hedge built by the British in India to prevent smuggling of salt and sugar. His next book, Tea: Addiction, Exploitation and Empire focuses on the effect of British tea addiction on British policies in Asia and Africa, and includes the author's own experience as a tea plantation manager in Africa.

It is part of the local government area.  History  Hardys Bay was named after Harry Hardy, who kept a small vineyard and sold wine to local residents. It is home to local shops and caf√©s, an RSL Club and a marina. The history of Hardys Bay and the surrounding areas of Wagstaffe, Killcare and Pretty Beach are closely linked. Prior to the arrival of European Settlement, Aboriginals from the coastal Guringai (Ku- ring-gai) tribe lived in and around Hardys Bay area. Evidence is to be found today in rock carvings and middens found in numerous locations around the area. On 6 June 1789 Governor Arthur Phillip sailed north and entered Broken Bay and explored the surrounding coastline. The first recorded white settler was a Mr James Mullen (or Mullin) who was granted temporary occupation of in 1824 for grazing and by the 1829 Census is recorded as having \\" of land, cleared, 10 cultivated and having 3 horses and 115 cattle. In 1859, Captain Daniel Joyce from New Zealand purchased a grant from Mallen. (This is the land on which the Hardys Bay R.S.L. is currently located.) Joyce subsequently defaulted on his debt which forced the mortgagees to sell his land in Brisbane Waters which was purchased by Mr Robert Hardy, Farmer. Access to Hardys Bay and the surrounding peninsular was via ferry until 1936 when the Scenic Road was opened. Electricity arrived in 1939 and town water was connected in 1980.  Development  Large scale rutile mining took place over the hill at Putty and Killcare beaches in the 1960s and stripped the beach of its large sand dunes and destroyed many native plants, molluscs and animals. Miners had agreed to revegetate the area which they did with the noxious pest bitou bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera), which the various land care groups are now trying to eradicate. Over the last 30 years property values in the area have reached into the millions of dollars as it is a prime location for holiday houses and retirement, like many other coastal areas within close proximity of a major city. Some heritage sites, including the Ferry Masters cottage at Wagstaffe have been illegally demolished and developed despite council attempts to prevents this; prosecution of the developers was unsuccessful due to a technicality.  Marina development  In late 2007 a scheme to develop the existing marina was presented to the community by the Marina's CEO, Michael Sparks. This $13 million development would see the existing marina as well as the historic Hardys Bay wharf replaced by a much larger structure containing: 100 car parks over the water; an increase in the number of berths from 23 to 100; additional retail, cafe and restaurant space; as well as providing a 7-day a week boat maintenance facility. Additionally, any applications for new or upgraded marinas must include the provision of a 24-hour sewerage pump-out facility. Sparks also advised that this marina project application would circumvent the local council approval process and use what is called the Part 3A method of approval. This is a reference to the new provision in the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act which reduces the involvement of the community in the original decision making process. The decision makers for applications made by marinas under this law are the Minister for Planning and Director General, Department of Planning. While the developers maintain that there will be little environmental impact, a stand of Grey Mangroves (Avicennia marina) will have to be removed to make way for the structure, and degradation of the beds of sea grasses is also possible. Following a presentation to the Hardys Bay Resident Group on 19 February 2008 by Sparks, the group rejected the redevolpment plan. In March 2008, the Wagstaffe to Killcare Community Association also announced that they could not support the current proposal. In early 2008 the plan was rejected by the Department of Planning after numerous complaints from as far away as Slovenia.

It is part of the 2560 acres granted to Charles Horatio Matcham, a nephew of Lord Nelson. The first settlers to buy land on the Matcham Estate in the Holgate area were Captain and Mrs Heyne, who came here on their honeymoon in February 1908, when Captain Heyne was on furlough from the Indian Army. They returned in 1921 to take up permanent residence and had a long association with the area. Mrs Heyne lived to the age of 92 years and died in Gosford on 30 December 1976. In the early 1920s, the residents formed a Progress Association. One of the achievements was the successful petition to establish a telephone office in the area.

The Mt Penang Training School for Boys (later the Mount Penang Juvenile Justice Centre) was opened in 1911. Many of the boys came from the training ship Sobraon, which had been in Sydney Harbour before being condemned, as did former officer Basil Topple. The village of about fifteen families, mostly workers at the training school, was first called Kendall Heights, then Penang Mountain. The name Kariong was assigned in about 1947. Etymology Kariong was once believed to mean meeting place in the local Aboriginal language. Other early residents were told the name meant \\"place of the cold winds\\", and the name is listed, albeit with a different spelling, in F.D. McCarthy's Australian Aboriginal place names book of 1946 with this meaning. However, records in the NSW Mitchell Library show that the name Kariong was a typographical error from old script reading 'Karrong'; the second 'r' was mistaken for an 'i'. Geography Kariong's boundaries include a considerable section of the Brisbane Water National Park to the south, and the Mount Penang Parklands, with its native gardens. Kariong is considered the entry point to the Central Coast as it borders the Pacific Motorway M1.

Evidence is to be found today in rock carvings and middens found in numerous locations around the area. After British settlement the area was established as a fishing and farming community. The name probably originated later as it was subdivided early last century as \\"killing one's cares\\". The Killcare area encompasses both the beach and bay side of the Bouddi Peninsula and is flanked by the Bouddi National Park. Killcare retains a small fishing village atmosphere centred on the Killcare Store. The village has an unusually broad variety of shops including yacht charters, art gallery, hairdresser, fashion boutique, restaurant and cafes and real estate agents. Killcare Marina has permanent moorings. The area has a strong community with many associations including the new Pretty Beach Community Pre-School and Pretty Beach Public School at neighbouring Pretty Beach. The neighbouring suburb Hardys Bay encompasses the south sector of the bay where the Community Church and the Hardys Bay RSL Club are located. The RSL hosts a series of local clubs including the Hardys Bay Hackers Golf Club and the Fridget Digits winter swimmers. Killcare is also home to the Killcare Rural Fire Service. The volunteer brigade services the surrounding suburbs and the Bouddi National Park, conducting controlled hazard reduction burning and a wide variety of other safety and hazard prevention activities.

The proposed development included a large, seven level building covering three blocks of land and requiring the removal of over 100 large trees. Four new commercial properties were proposed and nine terraced apartments were to step up the slope behind the retail premises. Underground parking for 34 cars was to be provided. The initial plans received over 600 objections and was rejected by the former Gosford City Council. An amended plan was lodged and received over 700 objections. Accordingly, the council rejected the development as being out of character with local planning requirements. In late 2009 the developers (Bespoke Properties P/L) subsequently appealed to the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales seeking a review of the Council‚Äôs decision to disallow that development at Hardys Bay. Hearings commenced on 2 March, with an onsite visit attended by the court, legal representatives and over 200 local residents. The appeal was dismissed by Commissioner Brown on Monday 8 March. Reasons cited for disallowing the development included; *The proposal was unacceptable due to its visual impact and on the basis of character. *There was no justification for the consolidation of the lots. *The proposal failed to respect the vegetation on the site or the slope of the site. *The zone of a site was not an entitlement for development but rather a maximum.

He received his bachelor's degree from the Juilliard School where he has served on the faculty since 1969. After his graduation from Juilliard, he served in the United States Army where he conducted the First Army band at Fort Jay on Governor's Island. His idea of presenting free productions began in 1954 when he founded the Xavier Symphony Society, made up of volunteer performers. Gian- Carlo Menotti was so taken by La Selva's performance of The Saint of Bleecker Street, that Menotti had La Selva perform the piece at New York's City Opera. This led to his being hired to conduct the City Opera's orchestra full-time. Founding of the New York Grand Opera Company La Selva founded the New York Grand Opera Company in 1973. Since 1974, he has performed complete operas at no charge to the public in New York City's Central Park. One of the most ambitious projects of the NYGO was the chronological presentation of all of Verdi's operas from 1994 onwards, beginning with Oberto (1839) and ending with Falstaff in 2000 and with the finale of the series being the Requiem Mass performed on the 100th anniversary of Verdi's death, 27 January 2001, at Carnegie Hall. In November 2006, NYGO performed Beethoven's symphony no.9 at the Isaac Stern Auditorium at Carnegie Hall with soprano Maria Knapik, mezzo- soprano Jeeminn Lee, tenor Edward Perretti and baritome Frederick Redd. Other conducting venues La Selva has conducted the New Jersey Symphony, the Symphony of the Air, the Juilliard Symphony, the Brno State Philharmonic and the Bern Symphony. Awards and honors In 1995 the President of Italy knighted La Selva as a \\"Cavaliere\\" in the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic for his performances of Giuseppe Verdi works.

Shortly after his 2 September 1963 debut on CHCH-TV in Hamilton, Ontario, the station received 1131 letters in a nine-day span, raising expectations of syndication throughout Canada. 195 episodes of The Ed Allen Show were produced by the Canadian production team of Al Guest and Jean Mathieson. Ed Allen had a following of millions of viewers and fans, from all over the world. His exercise show was still being distributed in the early 1990s. The format was usually set somewhere on a beach; in the late 1960s, the filming location was in Montego Bay, Jamaica at the Half Moon Hotel, specifically the Kennedy Beach House. Indicates age 40 at that time. Barbie, Ed‚Äôs second wife (m. 1974, n√©e Barbara A.

Avenue Campus is a campus of the University of Southampton and is located in Southampton, England. It currently houses most of the University's Faculty of Humanities. It is located off The Avenue, borders Southampton Common and is less than a mile from the University's main Highfield Campus.  History  Prior to the campus site being occupied by the University, the site was home to Taunton's School, a secondary school for boys, of which the main building still stands as part of the main campus building. The foundation stone of the main building was laid in 1925 and the building opened a year later at a cost of ¬£48,286. In 1969, it was reorganised as a sixth form college for boys and renamed to Richard Taunton College. The college remained on the site until 1993 when they moved to their present site on Hill Lane, on the opposite side of Southampton Common. In December 1993, the University bought the site from Hampshire County Council for ¬£2 million as a means of expansion. At the time, the University was seeking to expand, but due to the then planning laws the University could not expand its Highfield campus without accommodating a large number of car parking spaces in the form of three multi-storey car parks. As a result, the sought solution was to expand onto another campus and the former Taunton's school was chosen due to its close proximity to Highfield. In 1994, the London company Hawkins Brown was appointed to design the refurbishment of the old school buildings. These included the creation of a glass fronted courtyard, a large lecture theatre being installed in the old assembly hall, a cafe in the old gym and the extension of the building to include another lecture theatre and a wing to house the academic's offices. The building was completed and occupied from late 1996 ironically soon before the requirement for car parking was removed due to a change in planning regulations that allowed instead for an improved public transport network. The campus further expanded with the construction of the Archaeology building, opened on 10 October 2006 by Coldplay member Will Champion, who had close connections to the Archaeology academics. The building cost ¬£2.7 million.  Facilities  The Campus from the south, showing the main Parkes building extension (centre) and the Archaeology building (far left). The campus consists of four buildings: the Archaeology and Burgess buildings, a former residential style building on Highfield Road and the main Parkes building, named after Reverend Dr James Parkes who founded the Parkes Institute for Jewish/Non-Jewish Relations that is based at the University. The campus houses the University's faculty of Humanities and as a result the campus houses the offices of all the academics in the faculty (with the exception of Music which remained on the Highfield Campus where they could access the Turner Sims Concert Hall) as well as the faculty Student Office. The teaching buildings of the campus are all located in the Parkes Building and these consist of three lecture theatres and nine lecture and seminar rooms. In addition to this there are other learning aids in the form of six computer rooms, postgraduate research rooms, the Avenue Library of key course material and the Centre for Language Studies which also has a library of foreign language materials. Social facilities are solely provided by the Avenue Cafe, run by the University catering department. The grounds also contain two tennis courts.  Location  The campus is located on Highfield Road on the western edge of the Highfield district of Southampton. The area to the west of the campus is part of Southampton Common, only broken by the A33 The Avenue road into central Southampton. It is located a ten-minute walk away from the main Highfield campus and the route between the two campuses is a designated cycleway. The campus is served by the Unilink U2B bus service to Bassett Green, which runs down Highfield Road, and by the Unilink U2C to the city centre and the Bluestar 1 service to Winchester and Southampton city centre which runs down the Avenue nearby.

A variant chambered in .300 AAC Blackout also available. As with all personal defense weapons, the KAC PDW is intended to be compact and lightweight (similar to submachine guns), but have a longer useful range (out to the low end of combat rifle ranges, 250‚Äì300 m).  Design  The KAC PDW combines new and off the shelf components in its design. The lower receiver, holding the magazine and trigger assembly, is essentially a shortened M16 rifle lower receiver, which makes the basic operating controls familiar to many potential users. The cartridge, upper receiver, and operating mechanism are all new designs by KAC.KAC's NEW PERSONAL DEFENSE WEAPON , Gary Paul Johnston, November 7, 2006, Soldier of Fortune magazine website, accessed January 16, 2007. The KAC PDW uses a completely side-folding stock, unlike the M16 and M4 designs which have their main operating spring in a tube in the stock, and therefore can only partially telescope, and not fold sideways at all. The KAC PDW is over 10 inches shorter (19.5\\" vs. 29.8\\" with stocks folded) and more than 1 pound lighter (4.5 lb vs. 6.3 lb) than the currently serviced M4 carbine, a carbine in service with every branch of the US Military, and the barrel has been lightened with a new dimpling process. The KAC PDW has two gas pistons tapping hot gas from the barrel to operate its mechanism, located on the top left and right sides of the bolt carrier. The single mainspring is located on top, between the two gas pistons.Defense Review article on KAC PDW and competitors, accessed December 21, 2006.  Ammunition  The KAC PDW fires a 6√ó35 mm cartridge, a full centimeter shorter than the western military standard 5.56√ó45mm NATO round. The 6mm bullet is slightly wider, and the standard 6√ó35mm bullet slightly heavier, than the standard 5.56mm bullet ( versus ). Fired from a 10-inch (250 mm) barrel, KAC claims that the 6√ó35mm cartridge reaches a muzzle velocity of , slightly faster than the muzzle velocity of a 5.56 mm cartridge fired from a similarly short barrel. The larger diameter, shorter 6 mm cartridge is optimized for these shorter barrel lengths, and would perform less efficiently from rifle- length barrels. The round's muzzle energy is versus for a 5.56 mm bullet, again from the same 10\\" standard barrel. There is a discrepancy between the velocity claimed by Knight's for 5.56 mm SS109 NATO ammunition fired from a Colt Commando barrel (, energy) and other M16 manufacturers' stated muzzle velocities (, ). In any case the energies and velocities are roughly comparable.  History  The weapon was formally introduced at the 2006 NDIA Small Arms Symposium in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Some writers were shown samples at the earlier 2006 SHOT Show. The only KAC PDWs ordered by the U.S. Government were for the United States Secret Service.

She was a second cousin of the American actress Katharine Hepburn. Life Alice Tully was born in Corning, Steuben County, New York, the daughter of lawyer and State Senator William J. Tully (1870‚Äì1930) and Clara Mabel (Houghton) Tully (1870‚Äì1958) and had one younger sister Marion Gordon (Tully) Hoover Dimick (died Washington, 1981). She spent her high school years at the Westover School in Middlebury, Connecticut. Tully began her career as a mezzo-soprano, then became a soprano. She studied in Paris and made her debut in 1927 with the Pasdeloup Orchestra. In 1933, she appeared in Cavalleria rusticana in New York City. Upon her mother's death in 1958, Tully inherited the estate of her grandfather, Amory Houghton Jr. (1837-1909), (son of Amory Houghton, Sr., founder of the Corning Glass Works), who on June 19, 1860, married Tully's grandmother Ellen Ann Bigelow (daughter of Alanson Bigelow and his Bigelow first cousin, once removed, Anne Rebecca Bangs.) During the rest of her life, Tully donated much of her income to arts institutions, often anonymously. Her cousin, Arthur Amory Houghton, Jr., one of the founders of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, suggested that she give money for a chamber music hall, and in 1963 John D. Rockefeller III convinced her to allow it to be named Alice Tully Hall. Tully chaired the board of directors of the New York Chamber Music Society, and served on the boards of the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera and the Juilliard School. In 1970, Tully was awarded the Handel Medallion for her contributions to the cultural life of New York City. Her most famous commission was for Olivier Messiaen who composed Des canyons aux √©toiles... which had its first performance in the Alice Tully Hall in 1974. In 1985, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts.  Death  William Schuman, Gian Carlo Menotti and Riccardo Malipiero dedicated works to her. Tully never married, she suffered a stroke in 1991, and died in New York in 1993, aged 91. References Sources *Fuller, A., Alice Tully: An Intimate Portrait, 1999, University of Illinois Press.

Expressionist elements, particularly his use of colour but also his subject matter, immediately distinguish Kubi≈°ta's Cubist work (such as his 1912 St Sebastian) from that of founding Paris Cubists Picasso, Braque and the Section d'Or. He studied colour theory, analyzing the harmonic and compositional principles of painters such as El Greco, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Vincent van Gogh, and Edvard Munch. He also paid close attention to mathematical and geometric principles. Around 1911, he became acquainted with Jan Zrzav√Ω and the artistic group Sursum. Kubi≈°ta joined the army in 1913.

It was broadcast in season 3 of the CBS anthology series DuPont Show of the Month on the evening of November 9, 1959. Written by Dale Wasserman, the play was converted by him ca. 1964 into the libretto for the stage musical Man of La Mancha, with songs by Mitch Leigh and Joe Darion. After a tryout at Goodspeed Opera House in Connecticut,Award Winning Musical Theatre at Goodspeed Opera House and The Norma Terris Theatre in East Haddam & Chester, Conn. - Goodspeed MusicalsMan of La Mancha opened in New York on November 22, 1965, at the ANTA Washington Square Theatre.IBDB: The official source for Broadway Information The title of the 1959 teleplay was originally Man of La Mancha, but sponsor DuPont Corp. objected and producer David Susskind changed it to the more specific I, Don Quixote, fearing that the TV audience would not know who Wasserman was referring to if the original title was used.Wasserman, D. \\"The Impossible Musical,\\" Applause Theatre and Cinema Books 2003 pages 49 and 108. Wasserman reported that he disliked this title \\"to this very day\\". When the teleplay was made into the famous stage musical, the original title Man of La Mancha was restored. I, Don Quixote has almost exactly the same plot and even much of the same dialogue as Man of La Mancha. Even the famous opening two lines of La Mancha's hit song The Impossible Dream appeared in this teleplay. According to academic research by Cervantes scholar Howard Mancing, these lines and a few others were originally written for the now-forgotten 1908 play Don Quixote by Paul Kester. Wasserman, however, always claimed that the lines were his own, despite the allegation that they appeared in print six years before he was born. Wasserman himself noted that he had tried to cut the impossible dream speech from the teleplay due to a need to fit the performance into the 90 minute slot, but that Lee J. Cobb, who played both Miguel de Cervantes and Don Quixote, had insisted it go back in.Wasserman 2003 page 50. I, Don Quixote starred, in addition to Cobb, Colleen Dewhurst (in her first major role) as Aldonza/Dulcinea, Eli Wallach as Cervantes' manservant as well as Sancho Panza, and Hurd Hatfield as Sanson Carrasco as well as a character called The Duke. Plot summary Miguel de Cervantes and his manservant have been thrown into a dungeon by the Spanish Inquisition for an offense against the Church. In the dungeon, a mock trial is staged, with its intention being that the prisoners rob Cervantes of all of his possessions, including a precious manuscript that he refuses to give up. It is, of course, the yet-to-be-published manuscript of Don Quixote de la Mancha, Cervantes's masterpiece. In defending himself, Cervantes begins to narrate his story of Don Quixote, with Cervantes as the Don Quixote, the role of Sancho enacted by Cervantes' own manservant, and the other characters in the story played by the other prisoners. The work is not, and does not pretend to be, an accurate rendition of either Cervantes' life or the novel Don Quixote (for example, Cervantes had no direct contact with the Inquisition at any time in his life), although it draws on both for inspiration and on the latter for characters. Differences between teleplay and musical In the teleplay there are fewer transitions from the prison to the Don Quixote scenes than there are in the musical. The teleplay also includes many adventures from the novel which had to be left out of the musical Man of La Mancha due to time constraints, such as the attack on the flock of sheep. The encounter with the windmills, instead of taking place in the early part of the story, as in both Cervantes' novel and the musical, here takes place towards the end.http://www.h-net.org/~cervantes/csa/articf01/diary.pdf The cynical prisoner known as \\"The Duke\\", who plays Dr. Sanson Carrasco in the Don Quixote scenes, is here identified as being British, not Spanish, a fact that places him in considerably more jeopardy with regard to his fate (Spain and England were mortal enemies at the time). In Man of La Mancha, he is depicted as probably being Spanish. In I, Don Quixote, he reveals his terror over his possible fate at the end, when, along with Cervantes and the manservant, he is summoned to face the Inquisition; in Man of La Mancha, only Cervantes and the manservant are summoned at the end, and \\"The Duke\\" reacts with no emotion. Additional dialogue in the film Man of La Mancha There is some additional and unfamiliar dialogue heard in the 1972 film version of Man of La Mancha starring Peter O'Toole and Sophia Loren. It is taken directly from the original TV play I, Don Quixote. Some of this dialogue fleshes out the personality of \\"The Duke\\", when he reveals himself as an informer who deliberately sells misleading information about countries to willing buyers. It was restored to the film version of the musical after having been cut from the stage libretto.Wasserman 2003. However, this dialogue has been restored to later versions. Teleplay reception I, Don Quixote was highly acclaimed, but oddly enough, did not win any Emmy nominations, although Dale Wasserman received a Writers Guild of America award for his work. After it was shown, Wasserman optioned it for Broadway, but the option was not picked up. Stage director Albert Marre finally read it and suggested that it should be turned into a musical. I, Don Quixote has not been rebroadcast on television since 1959. There is a rare tape of the original broadcast in the collection of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, at Lincoln Center. The actual dialogue as recorded differs significantly from the script published in the journal Cervantes of the Cervantes Society of America,vol. 21, no. 2, 2001, pp. 125-213, http://users.ipfw.edu/jehle/cervante/csa/articf01/IDonQuix.pdf, retrieved 09/25/2014 accompanied by \\"A Diary for I, Don Quixote\\",pp. 117-123, http://users.ipfw.edu/jehle/cervante/csa/articf01/diary.pdf , retrieved 09/25/2014 and then reprinted in Dale Wasserman's memoir, The Impossible Musical.Wasserman 2003 pages 195-318.

Procedure Instillation abortion is performed by injecting a chemical solution consisting of either saline, urea, or prostaglandin through the abdomen and into the amniotic sac. The cervix is dilated prior to the injection, and the chemical solution induces uterine contractions which expel the fetus.James, Denise. (2006). Therapeutic Abortion. Retrieved February 24, 2009. Sometimes a dilation and curettage procedure is necessary to remove any remaining fetal or placenta tissue. Instillation methods can require hospitalization for 12 to 48 hours. In one study, when laminaria were used to dilate the cervix overnight, the time between injection and completion was reduced from 29 to 14 hours.Stubblefield, Phillip G., Carr-Ellis, Sacheen, & Borgatta, Lynn. (2004). Methods of Induced Abortion . Obstetrics & Gynecology, 104 (1), 174-185. Retrieved August 14, 2006. Usage The method of instillation abortion was first developed in 1934 by Eugen Aburel.

In a 1998 Guttmacher Institute survey, sent to hospitals in Ontario, Canada, 9% of those hospitals in the province which offered abortion services used saline instillations, 4% used urea, and 25% used prostaglandin. A 1998 study of facilities in Nigeria which provide abortion found that only 5% of the total number in the country use saline. Complications Once in common practice, abortion by intrauterine instillation has fallen out of favor, due to its association with serious adverse effects and its replacement by procedures which require less time and cause less physical discomfort.Trupin, Suzanne R. (2006). Abortion. Retrieved August 14, 2006. Saline is in general safer and more effective than the other intrauterine solutions because it is likely to work in one dose. Prostaglandin is fast- acting, but often requires a second injection, and carries more side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Instillation of either saline or prostaglandin is associated with a higher risk of immediate complications than surgical D&C.; Dilation and evacuation is also reported to be safer than instillation methods. One study found that the risk of complications associated with the injection of a combination of urea and prostaglandin into the amniotic fluid was 1.9 times that of D&E.; The rate of mortality reported in the United States between 1972 and 1981 was 9.6 per 100,000 for instillation methods. This is in comparison to rates of 4.9 per 100,000 for D&E; and 60 per 100,000 for abortion by hysterotomy and hysterectomy.

Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) is an alternative or complementary type of therapy that involves animals as a form of treatment. It falls under the realm of Animal Assisted Interventions (AAI). AAI is general term that encompasses any intervention or treatment that includes an animal in a therapeutic context such as Emotional-Support Animals, Service/Assistance Animals (i.e., trained animals that assist and support with daily activities), and Animal Assisted Activity (AAA). AAT contains sub- sections based on the type of animal, the targeted population, and how the animal is being incorporated into the therapeutic plan. The most commonly used types of AAT are canine-assisted therapy and equine-assisted therapy. The goal of AAT is to improve a patient's social, emotional, or cognitive functioning and literature reviews state that animals can be useful for educational and motivational effectiveness for participants. There are various studies documenting the positive effects of AAT reported through subjective self- rating scales and objective physiological measures, such as blood pressure and hormone levels.  Physiological effects  Wilson's (1984) biophilia hypothesis is based on the premise that our attachment to and interest in animals stems from the strong possibility that human survival was partly dependent on signals from animals in the environment indicating safety or threat. The biophilia hypothesis suggests that if we see animals at rest or in a peaceful state, this may signal to us safety, security and feelings of well- being which in turn may trigger a state where personal change and healing are possible. Six neurotransmitters that influence mood have been documented to release after a 15-minute or more interaction with animals. Mirror neuron activity and disease-perception through olfactory (smelling) ability in dogs may also play important roles in helping dogs connect with humans during therapeutic encounters. Medical uses Animals can be used in a variety of settings such as prisons, nursing homes, mental institutions, and in the home. There are numerous techniques used in AAT, depending on the needs and condition of the patient. Assistance dogs are capable of assisting certain life activities and of helping people navigate outside of the home. As with all other interventions, assessing whether a program is effective as far as its outcomes are concerned is easier when the goals are clear and are able to be specified. There are a range of goals for animal assisted therapy programs relevant to children and young people, including enhanced capacity to form positive relationships with others. It is understood that pets provide benefits to those with mental health conditions, but further research is required to test the nature and extent of this relationship with an animal as a pet and how it differs between pets, emotional support animals, service animals, and animal-assisted therapy.  Cognitive Rehabilitation Treatment  Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) survivors with cognitive impairments can benefit from AAT as part of a comprehensive and holistic rehabilitation treatment plan. Pets may promote kindness in children. Pediatric care Therapists rely on techniques such as monitoring a child's behavior with the animal, their tone of voice, and indirect interviewing. AAT can be used in children with mental health problems, can be used as a stand-alone treatment or it can be used along with conventional methods. Animals can be used as a distraction method when it comes to various situations or pain, and animals can also help bring happiness, pleasure, and entertainment to the pediatric population. Animals can also help improve children's moods and reinforce positive behaviors while helping to decrease negative ones. AAT research most commonly reported results were decreased anxiety and pain within the pediatric population. Dogs have shown to increase comfort and decrease pain in pediatric palliative care. Specific tactics have not been researched, but collective reviews of varied techniques displayed similar results of increased comfort reports by children and guardians. Prisons Animal-assistance programs may be useful in prisons to relieve stress of the inmates and workers, or to provide other benefits, but further study is needed to confirm the effectiveness of such programs in these settings. Internal file data reviews, anecdotal stories, and surveys of inmate and staff perceptions have been used to gauge the effectiveness of animal-assisted therapy in prisons, but these methods are limited and have resulted in an inadequate assessment. Researchers have, however, begun to find methods of gauging the effectiveness of prison animal programs (PAP) by using Propensity Score Watching. Conclusions through this method showed that PAPs positively impact reductions in severe or violent infractions. A reduction in offenses statistically may reduce recidivism rates and increase former inmate job marketability and societal reintegration. Training and being responsible for an animal can foster empathy, emotional intelligence, communication, and self-control in inmates. PAP's also benefit the animals involved as many come from situations where they faced abuse, neglect or euthanasia. Nursing homes The findings offer proof of the concept that canine-assisted therapies are feasible and can elicit positive quality-of-life experiences in institutionalized people with dementia. Researchers and practitioners need to elucidate the theoretical foundations of AATs. The Lived Environment Life Quality (LELQ) Model may serve as a guide for client-centered, occupation-focused, and ecologically valid approaches to animal-assisted occupational therapy beyond people with dementia. When elderly people are transferred to nursing homes or LTC facilities, they often become passive, agitated, withdrawn, depressed, and inactive because of the lack of regular visitors or the loss of loved ones..Sutton, D., M. (1984). Use of pets in therapy with elderly nursing home residents. Toronto, Canada: American Psychological Association Supporters of AAT say that animals can be helpful in motivating the patients to be active mentally and physically, keeping their minds sharp and bodies healthy. A significant difference has been seen among verbal interactions among nursing home residents with a dog present. Therapists or visitors who bring animals into their sessions at the nursing home are often viewed as less threatening, which increases the relationship between the therapist/visitor and patient.  Types  Various animal species are used in animal-assisted therapy (AAT). Individual animals are evaluated with strict criteria before being used in AAT. The criteria include appropriate size, age, aptitude, typical behaviors and the correct level of training. The most common forms of AAT are with dogs and horses. There is also published research on dolphin therapy.  Canine-assisted therapy  In canine-assisted therapy, therapy dogs interact with clients in animal assisted interventions, to enhance therapeutic activities and well-being including the physical, cognitive, behavioral and socio-emotional functioning of clients. Well trained therapy dogs exhibit the behavior that human clients construe as friendly and welcoming. They comfort clients via body contact. Therapy dogs are also required to possess a calm temperament for accommodating the contact with unfamiliar clients while they serve as a source of comfort. They promote patients engaging in interactions which can help patient improve motor skills and establish trusting relationship with others. The interaction between patients and therapy dogs also aids reducing stressful and anxious feelings patients have. Due to those benefits, canine assisted therapy is used as a complement to other therapies to treat diagnosis such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and dementia. Canine assistance can also be used in classroom for promoting the development of creative writing and living skills and the participation of children in group activities. There are programs called canine-assisted reading programs which facilitate children with special educational needs. These programs utilize the calm, non-judgmental, happy characteristics of canines to let the process of reading become more meaningful and enjoyable for children. With these benefits, researchers suggest to incorporating dogs into assisting learning and educational programs. Equine-related therapy Hippotherapy is promoted as a treatment for people with physical or mental challenges. A distinction exists between hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding. The American Hippotherapy Association defines hippotherapy as a physical, occupational, and speech- language therapy treatment strategy that utilizes equine movement as part of an integrated intervention program to achieve functional outcomes, while the Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship International (PATHI) defines therapeutic riding as a riding lesson specially adapted for people with special needs. According to Marty Becker, hippotherapy programs are active \\"in twenty-four countries and the horse's functions have expanded to therapeutic riding for people with physical, psychological, cognitive, social, and behavioral problems\\". Hippotherapy has also been approved by the American Speech and Hearing Association as a treatment method for individuals with speech disorders. In addition, equine assisted psychotherapy (EAP) uses horses for work with persons who have mental health issues. EAP often does not involve riding. Additional information pertaining to equine assisted therapy can be seen with Laira Gold's open clinical study of EAT.  Dolphin therapy  Dolphin assisted therapy refers to the controversial alternative medicine practice of swimming with dolphins. This form of therapy has been strongly criticized as having no long term benefit, and being based on flawed observations. Psychologists have cautioned that dolphin assisted therapy is not known to be effective for any condition and that it presents considerable risks to both human patients and the captive dolphins. The child has a one-on- one session with a therapist in a marine park of some kind. An ethical issue with data on dolphin-assisted therapy and the effectiveness of it is that most of the research is done by people who operate the dolphin-assisted therapy programs.  Conditions Benefit from Animal-Assisted Therapy  Based on current research, there are many conditions/disorders that can benefit from animal-assisted therapy (AAT) in diverse settings around the world. Those conditions include psychological disorder, developmental disorder, dementia, cancer, chronic pain, advanced heart failure, etc. Animal-assisted therapy is commonly used for psychological disorder. Disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD) are part of psychological disorders that can benefit from animal-assisted therapy.  Effectiveness  In recent decades, an increased number of research indicates the social, psychological, and physiological benefits of animal assisted therapy in health and education field. Although the effectiveness of AAT is still unclear due to the lack of clarity regarding the degree to which the canine itself contributes in the recovery process, there is a growing awareness that AAT may be effective in treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and dementia.  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder  Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may decrease behavioral issues and improve socialization skills with the intervention of AAT. Compared to children only received cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), children who received both canine-assisted therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) had reduce in severity of ADHD symptoms. However, the canine- assisted therapy had no effect on relieving ADHD symptoms in long-term treatment.  Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder  Animal Assisted Therapy for the Treatment of Trauma in Military Veterans Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychological disorder affects people's mental health and has varying severity and forms. PTSD is often difficult to treat due to high drop- out rates and low responses to traditional psychotherapeutic approaches and interventions. Animals have two types of effects, direct and indirect, on a mental health spectrum including biological, psychological, and social responses, further targeting marked symptoms of PTSD (i.e., re-experiencing, avoidance, changes in beliefs/feelings, and hyperarousal). Direct effects of animals include a decrease in anxiety and blood pressure while indirect effects result in increased social interactions and overall participation in everyday activities. Biologically, specific neurochemicals are released when observing human and animal interactions. Similarly, dog assistance can potentially mediate oxytocin which effects social and physical wellbeing and decrease blood pressure.[17] The psychological benefits of animals focus mainly on dog and human interactions, the reduction of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and increased resilience. Animals in this capacity can further provide emotional and psychological assistance and support, addressing several PTSD symptoms. The presence of an animal can alleviate intrusion symptoms by providing a reminder that there is no danger present. Animals can further elicit positive emotions, targeting emotional numbing experiences. Animal interactions also provide social benefits, providing companionship and alleviate feelings of loneliness and isolation through everyday routines and increased social interactions in public. The incorporation and involvement of animals dates back to the earliest forms of organized combat. Dogs, in particular, were utilized in different capacities. Ancient armies employed dogs as Soldiers and companions which extended to modern combat including dogs as a crucial asset in communication, detection, and intimidation. In World War II, dogs were used in therapy as emotional support during the war. While a range of animals can be utilized in AAIs, dogs and horses have been investigated and explored as forms of rehabilitation for veterans suffering from PTSD. Dog assisted therapy and therapeutic horseback riding are non- invasive methods for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in veterans.[17]. Canines can easily integrate into a multitude of environments, are highly responsive to humans, and are very intelligent. For those reasons, dogs are the most common animal used in AAIs. Dogs are typically categorized according to the level of training received and the specific needs of the individual. A service dog provides relief through specialized support related to a physical, mental, or psychological disability. Emotional support animals (ESAs) solely provide psychological relief and do not require specialized training. Therapy animals often provide additional support in a therapeutic environment by supporting counselors or therapists in their therapeutic duties. While service dogs, ESAs, and therapy dogs can support the diverse symptoms that veterans, specifically bred and selected dogs, PTSD Service Dogs (PSDs), are trained and assigned to veterans with PTSD to support with daily life activities as well as with emotional and mental health needs. Dogs provide subjective positive effects to veterans and serve as a compassionate reminder to veterans suffering from PTSD that danger is not present, creating a safe space for the veteran. They are often sensitive to humans and have the ability to adapt their behavior accordingly by doing tasks such as preventing panic, waking a veteran from a nightmare, and nudging to help the veteran ‚Äústay in the present‚Äù. Dogs also provide veterans with a nonjudgmental and safe environment that can help a veteran express feelings and process thoughts without interruption, criticism or advice. Interactions, such as petting, playing and walking, with the dog can increase physical activity, reduce anxiety, and provide encouragement to stay in the present moment. The interaction between dog and veterans supports social interactions for isolated veterans, reduces symptoms associated with PTSD such as depression and anxiety, and increases veterans‚Äô calmness.[17] Similar to dogs, horses have been included in the treatment of veterans suffering from PTSD by providing an accepting and nonjudgmental environment, which further facilitates a veterans‚Äô ability to cope with symptoms associated with PTSD. Because horses are social animals, they are capable of creating and responding to relationships based on the veteran's energy, providing an opportunity for veterans to regain the ability to form trusting relationships. Therapeutic work with horses varies from ground-based activities, mounted activities, or a combination of both. In the therapeutic context, horses can promote cognitive reframing as well as an increase in the use of mindfulness practice. While there is limited research and standardized instruments to measure the effects, veterans who have participated in pilot programs have better communicate skills, self-awareness, and self-esteem, promoting safety and support during the transition into civilian life. Long term effects of equine based interventions with veterans include increased happiness, social support, and better sleep hygiene because they are able to process information regarding their emotions and behaviors in a nonjudgmental space. While AAIs can be effective, they also have limitations due to limited research and findings on AAIs and veterans with PTSD.Furthermore, studies approved yield small sample sizes which limit the power to detect changes as well as the specific tasks that are particularly helpful to veterans. AAT may also obstruct veterans from cultivating their own way of control over stressful situation.  Autism Spectrum Disorder  AAT could reduce the symptoms of ASD such as aggressiveness, irritability, distractibility, and hyperactivity. In one review, five out of nine studies reviewed showed positive effects of therapeutic horseback riding on children with ASD. Canine assisted intervention provides a calmer environment by reducing the stress, irritation, and anxiety that children with ASD experience. Playing with dogs increases the positive mood in children with ASD. Animals also can serve as a social catalyst. In the presence of animals, children with ASD are more likely engage in social interactions with humans. However, the impact of AAT upon parent- child interaction is not clear.  Dementia  AAT encourages expressions of emotions and cognitive stimulation through discussions and reminiscing of memories while the patient bonds with the animal. Studies have found that animal assisted therapies (particularly using dogs) resulted in measurable quality of life improvements for patients with dementia. Patients with dementia were also found to improve their social interactions and their scores on the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). AAT has also been shown to slightly reduce depressive symptoms in people with dementia in a 2019 systematic review.  Limitations  There is limited scientific research on the use of AAT within the population of adults who have been sexually assaulted. While animals do tend to comfort victims, animal therapy may not be the catalyst that provides positive success in therapy sessions. As mentioned above, adults tend not to focus as much on having an animal companion, and therefore, animal therapy cannot be attributed as the reason for success in those types of therapy sessions.[5] There are some ethical concerns that arise when applying animal therapy to younger victims of sexual assault. For example, if a child is introduced to an animal that is not their pet, the application of animal therapy can cause some concerns. First of all, some children may not be comfortable with animals or may be frightened which could be avoided by asking permission to use animals in therapy. Second, a special bond is created between animal and child during animal therapy. Therefore, if the animal in question does not belong to the child, there may be some negative side effects when the child discontinues therapy. The child will have become attached to the animal, which does raise some ethical issues as far as subjecting a child to the disappointment and possible relapse that can occur after therapy discontinues.[5] The effectiveness of AAT is also still unclear due to the lack of clarity regarding the degree to which the canine itself contributes in the recovery process. There are some concerns specific to dolphin-assisted therapy: First, it is potentially hazardous to the human patients, and it is harmful to the dolphins themselves; by taking dolphins out of their natural environment and putting them in captivity for therapy can be hazardous to their well-being. Second, dolphin-assisted therapy has been strongly criticized as having no long term benefit, and being based on flawed observations. Third, psychologists have cautioned that dolphin assisted therapy is not effective for any known condition.  History  Research has found animals can have an overall positive effect on health and improve mood and quality of life. The positive effect has been linked to the human-animal bond. In a variety of settings, such as prisons, nursing homes, and mental institutions, animals are used to assist people with different disabilities or disorders. In modern times animals are seen as \\"agents of socialization\\" and as providers of \\"social support and relaxation\\".Serpell JA. 2006. Animal- assisted interventions in historical perspective. In: Fine AH, ed. Handbook on Animal-Assisted Therapy: Theoretical Foundations and Guidelines for Practice. San Diego: Elsevier. p 3-17 The earliest reported use of AAT for the mentally ill took place in the late 18th century at the York Retreat in England, led by William Tuke. Patients at this facility were allowed to wander the grounds which contained a population of small domestic animals. These were believed to be effective tools for socialization. In 1860, the Bethlem Hospital in England followed the same trend and added animals to the ward, greatly influencing the morale of the patients living there. However, in other pieces of literature it states that AAT was used as early as 1792 at the Quaker Society of Friends York Retreat in England. Velde, Cipriani & Fisher also state \\"Florence Nightingale appreciated the benefits of pets in the treatment of individuals with illness.\\" The US military promoted the use of dogs as a therapeutic intervention with psychiatric patients in 1919 at St Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, DC. Sigmund Freud kept many dogs and often had his chow Jofi present during his pioneering sessions of psychoanalysis. He noticed that the presence of the dog was helpful because the patient would find that their speech would not shock or disturb the dog and this reassured them and so encouraged them to relax and confide. This was most effective when the patient was a child or adolescent. Modern AAT may have been influenced by attachment theory. Increased recognition of the value of human‚Äìpet bonding was noted by Dr. Boris Levinson in 1961. Dr. Boris Levinson accidentally used animals in therapy with children when he left his dog alone with a difficult child, and upon returning, found the child talking to the dog.

The fort's 46 bastions included two flanking towers at each of the four gates (the De, Sikki, Hareri and Khizri Gates). A ditch deep and wide and an glacis protected the fort from intruders. Within the fort stood a citadel flanked by 30 towers, enclosing mosques, a Hindu temple and a Khan's palace. The citadel was severely damaged by the battering it got from the guns of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1818.

It attracts many people for short stays during the hot summer. It is around 85 kilometres from Dera Ghazi Khan city, Punjab, Pakistan and about 185 kilometres from Multan in Sulaiman Mountain range. The people of Fort Munro are nomads, especially of the Leghari tribe. Fort Munro's altitude is 1800 meters. It can be reached either from Loralai Balochistan or from Multan (Punjab). From Punjab, the mountain range starts near Rakhni, which is a border-post between Balochistan and Punjab. History The town was founded by Robert Groves Sandeman in the later part of the 19th century and named Fort Munro after Colonel, later Major-General, Andrew Aldcorn Munro who was commissioner of the Derajat Division. Geography and climate Seasons of Fort Munro by Arslan Ahmad Fort Munro is part of the Sulaiman Mountain range. The range is located in central Pakistan, extending southward about 280 miles (450 km) from the Gumal Pass to just north of Jacobabad, separating the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab from Balochistan. Its heights gradually decrease toward the south, with summits averaging 6,000‚Äì7,000 feet, the highest being the twin peaks (30 miles from the Gumal Pass) called Takht-i Sulaiman, or Solomon's Throne, which legend connects with King Solomon's visit to Pakistan; the higher of the peaks, at 18,481 feet (5,633 m), is the site of a Muslim Ziyarat (shrine) visited annually by many pilgrims. The range's eastern face dips steeply to the Indus River, but on the west the range declines more gradually. Juniper and edible pines abound in the north and olives in the centre, but vegetation is scarce in the south. The Ghat, Zao, Chuhar Khel Dhana, and Sakhi Sarwar are the principal passes in the north. In the south, west of Dera Ghazi Khan, lies the hill station of Fort Munro.  Tourism  It attracts a number of tourists every year, particularly those who wish to escape from hot plains of southern Punjab to enjoy mild and pleasant weather for a day or two. The Punjab Government has released over Rs2 billion in July 2015 for the provision of basic facilities at the hill station in a bid to make it an important tourist haven. Out of the funds, Rs750 million would be spent on the installation of the chairlift and cable car facility between Fort Munro and Khar, Rs300 million on the provision of clean drinking water, Rs300 million on a wastewater treatment and drainage scheme, Rs1.60 billion on the construction of six new carpeted roads and a cadet college. Additionally, state-of-the-art landscaping initiatives and the cultivation of cut flowers would also promote development in the region and open new avenues of employment. The Forest Department would afforest 300 acres in the hill station‚Äôs vicinity. The Irrigation Department is also believed to have forwarded a proposal regarding the construction of six small dams in Fort Munro‚Äôs vicinity.http://tribune.com.pk/story/921058/fort-munro-development-authority- hill-station-set-to-become-tourist-haven/ The development project, which is expected to kick off soon, to attract people from surrounding areas being the only hill station of southern Punjab in Dera Ghazi Khan district.

The road was constructed between 1967 and 1973 and runs from Hackney Wick in north-east London, through the Blackwall Tunnel, to Kidbrooke in south-east London. The ECR was initially designated as part of the A102, but has, subsequently, been partially renumbered so that sections of it are now the A2 and A12. Route At its northern end, the ECR (A12) follows part of the route of the former North London Railway between the closed Victoria Park and Old Ford stations. The railway junction at Victoria Park, where the still open section of the North London Line to Stratford station diverged, was reconstructed to permit the construction of the junction with the non-dual carriageway section of the A102 and the A106 and A115 roads, above which the line passes. The branch track to the docks that ran alongside the ECR to Old Ford, which had been used only for freight since the 1940s, was subsequently closed and lifted in the early 1980s. At Bow Road, the junction with the A11 involves a triple-layer junction, Bow Interchange. The ECR passes through in a cutting below an interchange roundabout whilst the A11 passes above on a flyover. South of this junction, the ECR passes Bromley-by-Bow station and skirts the River Lee Navigation for a short distance as it follows the line of the former St Leonard Street. It then crosses Limehouse Cut and continues along what was Brunswick Road to East India Dock Road (A13). It passes under the A13 in another grade separated junction, becoming the A102, and then enters the Blackwall tunnel. South of the River Thames, the ECR (A102) skirts Tunnel Avenue and flies over Blackwall Lane (A2203) and Woolwich Road (A206) before climbing the hill towards the Sun-in-the-Sands interchange where it passes under Shooters Hill Road (A2/A207) and becomes the Rochester Way Relief Road (A2). It squeezes through the tight space between Rochester Way (the old A2 route) and Woolacombe Road before it ends at the Kidbrooke interchange where it connects to Kidbrooke Park Road (A2213) or continues as the later section of the Rochester Way Relief Road built in the 1980s. History The ECR and the other roads planned in the 1960s for central London which formed Ringway 1 of the London Ringways scheme had developed from early schemes prior to the Second World War through Sir Patrick Abercrombie's County of London Plan, 1943 and Greater London Plan, 1944 to a 1960s Greater London Council (GLC) scheme that would have involved the construction of many miles of motorway standard roads across the city and demolition on a massive scale. Due to the huge construction costs and widespread public opposition, most of the scheme was cancelled in 1973 and the ECR and the West Cross Route and Westway in west London were the only significant parts to be built. At the northern end of the ECR, the unrealised plans would have seen it connect at Hackney Wick to the unbuilt North Cross Route which would have run west across north London via Dalston, and also to the M11 motorway which was originally planned to continue south from its current starting point at the North Circular Road (A406) in South Woodford) to join Ringway 1. Part of this plan was eventually achieved in a modified form when, in the 1990s the 'A12 Hackney to M11 link road', or 'M11 Link Road' was constructed through Leyton, Leytonstone and Wanstead to connect to the ECR at Hackney Wick. This extension was designated as the A12 and required just the sort of controversial construction methods and widescale demolitions of residential areas that caused the 1960s schemes to be cancelled and provoked to the major M11 link road protest. After the new road was built, the northern part of the ECR became the A12. Had the North Cross Route been built incoming traffic from the M11 would have been able to continue west from Hackney Wick junction on a motorway standard road past Dalston, Highbury, Camden Town, under West Hampstead to Kilburn (where a link to the M1 would have been built) and then west to Harlesden, where it would have connected with the West Cross Route, running south to connect with the A40, A4 and on to cross the Thames to connect with the South Cross Route. Also at Hackney Wick a route was proposed running across Victoria Park to Bethnal Green; it would have then run over the Regent Canal to finish at the Angel, Islington, here it would have met the A1 road. It is probable that this road would have been named \\"Eastway\\" to form a pair with the Westway now which performs a similar function from Paddington to White City and, in fact, a short section of road adjacent to the ECR north of the Hackney Wick junction does bear this name today. At the southern end of the ECR, the plan was to connect it at Kidbrooke to the South Cross Route (running west across south London), the A2 (heading east out of London) and the A20 (heading south-east out of London). In fact, a new dual carriageway section of the A2 was constructed through Eltham to meet the ECR at Kidbrooke in the 1980s providing an efficient route out of London in this direction and the A20 passes only about to the south although it does not connect directly to the ECR and it was never upgraded to the motorway standard road that was intended. Without the construction of the other parts of the 1960s motorway plans the context of the ECR has been lost in the subsequent road renumbering and the only section of the East Cross Route which continues to carry the name is the former northern motorway section of the route in Hackney Wick. Parts of the route, at the northern end between Hackney Wick and Old Ford and south of the river between the Blackwall Tunnel and the Sun-in-the-Sands interchange, were previously classified as urban motorways and given the designation A102(M). The status was downgraded to a standard A-road in 2000 when responsibility for trunk roads in Greater London was transferred from the Highways Agency to the Greater London Authority.

Education Grange was educated at Gresham's School, Holt, Norfolk, and then from 1962 to 1967 at the Middlesex Hospital Medical School of the University of London. Career After qualification as a physician, Grange joined the Research Department at the Middlesex Hospital, where he studied the genus Mycobacterium and the diseases it causes in humans and other animals. This followed a stay in Zaire to study the Buruli ulcer. His doctoral thesis was on the classification of certain rapidly growing mycobacteria and led to research on the development of bacteriophage typing of mycobacteria for epidemiology. Next he was appointed Reader in Microbiology at the National Heart and Lung Institute, where his interests turned to the immunology and epidemiology of tuberculosis. From there he became assistant lecturer (1969-1970) at the Bland Sutton Institute of Pathology of Middlesex Hospital Medical School, University of London and then lecturer in the same school's Department of Microbiology from 1971 to 1976. From 1976 to 2000, Grange was Reader in Clinical Microbiology at the Imperial College School of Medicine and honorary consultant Microbiologist to the Royal Brompton NHS Trust. Between 1978 and 1995, he undertook a series of visits to Indonesia to pursue research into the immunology and epidemiology of tuberculosis. From 1985 to 1995, he was an honorary research fellow at King's College Hospital Medical School.

With the use of stochastic optimisation routines (Simulated Annealing) it generates spatial reserve systems that achieve particular biodiversity representation goals with reasonable optimality. Computationally, MARXAN provides solutions to a conservation version of the 0-1 knapsack problem, where the objects of interest are potential reserve sites with given biological attributes. The simulated annealing algorithm attempts to minimise the total cost of the reserve system, while achieving a set of conservation goals (typically that a certain percentage of each geographical/biological feature is represented by the reserve system).  History  MARXAN is a portmanteau acronym, fusing MARine, and SPEXAN, itself an acronym for SPatially EXplicit ANnealing. It was a product of Ian R. Ball's PhD thesis, while he was a student at the University of Adelaide in 2000, and was supervised and funded by Hugh Possingham, who currently holds a Federation Fellowship at the University of Queensland. It was an extension of the existing SPEXAN program.  Application  MARXAN is the most widely used systematic reserve planning software in the world,Airam√© et al.

The World Wildlife Fund used MARXAN to define a Global set of Marine Protected Areas, the Roadmap to Recovery, which they used to petition the UN about the creation of open ocean marine reserve networks. The software has also been used in terrestrial applications, such as: * The North American Wildlands Project. * Selecting priority areas for Global Mammal Assemblages.Ceballos, G. et al.

(2006) Conservation planning for ecosystem services?, Public Library of Science: Biology, 4(11), e379. * The Great Sand Hills of Saskatchewan Regional Environmental Study  Shortcomings  One shortcoming of MARXAN is its inability to deal with issues of demographic inter-connectedness. In marine systems, the presence of a biological feature does not guarantee the persistence of that feature in the absence of the surrounding ecosystem. This is a concept generally known as \\"connectivity\\". MARXAN considers that including into a reserve system a site that contains a particular feature will ensure the persistence of that feature, even though surrounding sites may not be included in the reserve system, and may therefore be ecologically compromised. MARXAN does employ a \\"boundary length modifier\\", which attempts to minimise the boundary length to area ratio, thus increasing the continuity of the reserve systems. This ad hoc alteration may go some way to addressing the problem.Leslie, H. et al. (2003) Using siting algorithms in the design of marine reserve networks, Ecological Applications, 13(1), S185-S198.

History Little Wobby was originally occupied by the Commonwealth Military Forces during the Second World War. Several buildings were erected along the shoreline to house artillery batteries in case of a Japanese invasion through Broken Bay and the Hawkesbury River. A submarine net was also put in place across the river. Two of these buildings still exist as dwellings, into which they were converted after the war. In the 1970s a plan was mooted for the State government to purchase all of the properties along the shore and demolish the houses in order to rehabilitate the land and return it to being part of the national park. This never went ahead. The only public utilities the houses enjoy are telephone and electricity. There is no town water or sewage connection: these are replaced with water tanks and septic tanks respectively.

Mooney Mooney is the location at which the Pacific Motorway and Pacific Highway cross from the Central Coast into Sydney's metropolitan area at Brooklyn in the Hornsby Shire. History Mooney Mooney is significant 'for its association with the early settlement of coastal NSW', according to a plaque at Deerubbun Reserve. In 1844, an early-colonial settler, George Peat, commenced a ferry service across the Hawkesbury River, from Mooney Mooney Point to Kangaroo Point on the southern bank. By 1930 this service was replaced by two diesel-powered vehicular ferries which became obsolete on completion of the Peats Ferry Road Bridge in 1945. Remnant timber piles of the former ferry docks, preserved in situ for posterity, can be seen on the foreshore of Mooney Mooney Point. The locality Mooney Mooney is part of the Central Coast Council local government area. The locality includes Peat Island and Spectacle Island, and formerly included Cheero Point to the north, but this locality was separately gazetted on 21 March 2003. Mooney Mooney's topography is characterised by a rocky foreshore onto the Hawkesbury River and a hilly landscape with slopes ranging from moderate to very steep. Land use is dominated by the north-south transport corridors, comprising the M1 Pacific Motorway and the Pacific Highway, and two adjoining residential areas east of the highway. Oyster farms and related depuration depots are located in the suburb's south. The locality is serviced by sealed roads, electricity, telephone and reticulated water supply. The Deerubbun Reserve adjoining the motorway at the suburb's southwest has been developed for public access to the Hawkesbury River. The reserve's public facilities include wharf, boat ramps, car and trailer parking area, fish-cleaning table, advisory signs (boating, fishing, personal water craft and navigation), picnic tables and amenities.Ellis Karm & Associates, p.37.

The slab has been especially popular in countries where the emphasis of home construction has been on precast concrete, including Northern Europe and former socialist countries of Eastern Europe. Precast concrete popularity is linked with low-seismic zones and more economical constructions because of fast building assembly, lower self weight (less material), etc. Precast hollow-core elements is also known as the most sustainable floor/roof system and has far smaller CO2 footprint than even CLT slabs. The precast concrete slab has tubular voids extending the full length of the slab, typically with a diameter equal to the 2/3-3/4 the thickness of the slab. This makes the slab much lighter than a massive solid concrete floor slab of equal thickness or strength. The reduced weight also lowers material and transportation costs. The slabs are typically 120 cm wide with standard thicknesses normally between 15 cm and 50 cm. Reinforcing steel wire rope provides bending resistance. Slabs in prestressed concrete are usually produced in lengths of up to 200 meters. The process involves extruding wet concrete along with the prestressed steel wire rope from a moving mold. The continuous slab is then cut to required lengths by a large diamond circular saw. Factory production provides the obvious advantages of reduced time, labor and training. Another fabrication system produces hollow-core floor slabs in Reinforced Concrete (not prestressed). These are made on carousel production lines, directly to exact length, and as a stock product. However, the length is limited to about 7-8 meters. Especially in Belgium, this method is widely used in private housing. To meet modern standards (both hollow-core and massive slab) of soundproofing the floor needs to be covered with a soft floor covering that is able to dampen the sound of footsteps or a floating floor screed should be installed. An alternative is to put a strip of rubber underneath the floor slabs. Hollow-core slabs and wall elements without prestressed steel wire can be formed by extruders. The size of these elements will typically range in width from 600 to 2400 mm, in thickness from 150 to 500 mm, and can be delivered in lengths of up to 24 m.elematic.com The voids of the hollow core can be used as conduit for installations. The interior of the core can be coated in order to use it as a ventilation duct.  Bridges  Hollow-core slabs are also used in the construction of bridges. In many cases the slab is molded in situ.

After the Penal Laws ceased to be rigorously enforced, he travelled to Rome to study for the priesthood, becoming ordained in 1770. He later taught philosophy and theology in Prague, and in 1777 became the Franciscan Prior in Waterford. Following developments in England, Catholics in Newfoundland gradually gained religious liberty, made explicit by a public declaration by the Governor in 1784. After a request from Irish merchants there to Bishop William Egan, O'Donel was sent to St. John's as Prefect Apostolic the same year, largely to deal with the presence of \\"unlicensed\\" and \\"unruly\\" priests on the island. In addition to his personal popularity, one of his qualifications for the position was an ability to preach in Gaelic. O'Donel found that insubordinate priests were fighting Irish battles, and set about reorganizing the Catholic Church in Newfoundland. He built a chapel in St. John's, established parishes outside the capital, and gradually brought priests under his authority. During his first few years in post, O'Donel also found that Catholic liberty was less than absolute, and was involved in an infamous incident in 1786 in which he was assaulted by Prince William Henry, later King William IV. In 1796, O'Donel became a bishop, consecrated as titular bishop of Thyatira at Quebec on 21 September. O'Donel's ministry in Newfoundland was largely characterized by trying to maintain peace, both between fellow Catholics and with the British. In 1800, an incipient Irish uprising involving soldiers in the St. John's garrison was forestalled when O'Donel, upon hearing of the plans, alerted the authorities. The 19th-century historian Charles Pedley alleged that O'Donel received his information via the confessional, but credible evidence for this claim is absent O'Donel's health deteriorated in the early 19th century, and he resigned his position in 1807 and returned to Ireland. He died of shock in 1811 after suffering minor injuries in a fire. Views Theologically, O'Donel subscribed to the Augustinian position that religion imposes a \\"reverential fear\\" on mankind's \\"naturally licentious\\" nature. This, and his belief in the essential mystery of the divine nature gave rise to his support for religious tolerance, since God's inscrutability would inevitably lead to theological disagreement, but furthermore, as he wrote to his contemporary John Jones, \\"an observant [C]hristian of any denomination is...a better man\\".

Plot Four retired mobsters Bobby (Richard Dreyfuss) - the straight man leader, Bats (Burt Reynolds) - a cantankerous man with a short fuse and a pacemaker, Mouth (Seymour Cassel) - a silent ladies man many years past his prime, and Brick (Dan Hedaya) - a nice but dimwitted man plan one last crime to save their apartment at a retirement home (the owners are forcing them out with a rent increase so that the apartments can be rented to young, affluent South Beach couples). The four steal a corpse from the mortuary to use as the \\"victim\\" in a staged murder scene. Unknown to them, the body was that of Luis Ventanna, the head of a Colombian drug smuggling ring. As a result of the \\"murder\\", many of the young renters leave and the four men are given cash and a rent discount by the complex to keep living there. Much of this money is spent on high living and women, which causes a young stripper, Ferris (Jennifer Tilly) to discover that the four men staged the murder - while spending time with the normally-silent \\"Mouth,\\" he reveals that his mouth is loosened by intimacy with women. To keep the woman quiet, the four agree to kill her stepmother (Lainie Kazan), but instead kidnap her and fake her death by setting fire to her mansion. In the process, they accidentally burn down the house of the drug-smuggler's son (Miguel Sandoval), who happened to live in a nearby mansion. Believing that someone is trying to usurp his power, the drug lord offers $100,000 to anyone who brings him the head of the man responsible. This results in a confrontation at the apartment, leading to the capture of a female police officer and her partner (Carrie-Anne Moss and Jeremy Piven), one of the wiseguys (Seymour Cassel), the young woman, and the stepmother. The other wiseguys manage to escape this conflict, and track down the men who kidnapped their friend. They call in all of their still-living former associates from their active years and lay siege to the ship where the drug lord is holding his prisoners. They then turn the ship and the drug smugglers over to the police, along with a shipment of drugs. A truckload of Cuban cigars is taken by the men and used to make their apartment complex into \\"a retirement home for old wiseguys who are down on their luck.\\" A sub-plot of the movie involves Richard Dreyfuss' search for his long lost daughter (Carrie-Anne Moss), whom he hasn't seen since he was in his 30s and she was a small child.

Here are some of the best-known mausoleums that can still be visited today. Mausoleum of Baha-ud-Din Zakaria Baha-ud-Din Zakaria Standing at the north-eastern fringe of the ancient fort of Multan is the eternal abode of Al-Sheikh Al-Kabir Sheikh-ul-Islam Baha-ud-Din Abu Muhammad Zakaria Al-Qureshi Al-Asadi, one of the greatest saints of the Suhrawardiyya Silsila (Sufi order or tariqa and one of the most distinguished disciples of Sheikh Al-Shuyukh Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi. He was the founder of Suhrawardiyya Silsila in the Indian subcontinent. He was born in 1170. Sheikh Baha-ud-Din Zakariya, known as Bahawal Haq, was born at Kot Kehror (Karor Lal Esan), a town of Layyah District near Multan, around 1170. For 15 years, he travelled to different cities in order to preach Islam and eventually settled in Multan in 1222. He died in 1267. The Mausoleum is a square of , measured internally. Above this is an octagon, about half the height of the square, which is surmounted by a hemispherical dome. The Mausoleum was almost completely ruined during the siege of Multan by the British in 1848, but was soon afterwards restored by Muslims. Tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam Tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam Multan The tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam, grandson of Shaikh Bahauddin Zakaria, which was built between 1320 and 1324, is an unmatched pre-Moghul masterpiece. The Mausoleum of Rukn-i-Alam could possibly be considered the glory of Multan. From any side the city is approached, the most prominent thing that can be seen from miles all around is a huge dome. This dome is the Shrine of Sheikh Rukn-ud-Din Abul Fath commonly known by the title Rukn-i-Alam (pillar of the world). The tomb is located on the southwest side of the Fort premises. This elegant building is an octagon, in diameter internally, with walls high and thick, supported at the angles by sloping towers. Over this is a smaller octagon , on the exterior side, and high, leaving a narrow passage all round the top of the lower story for the Moazzan, or public caller to prayers. The whole is surmounted by a hemispherical dome of external diameter. The total height of the building, including a plinth of , is . As it stands on the high ground, the total height above the road level is 150 feet. Besides its religious importance, the mausoleum is also of considerable archaeological value as its dome is reputed to be the second largest in the world, after 'Gol Gumbad' of Bijapur (India), which is the largest. The mausoleum is built entirely of red brick, bounded with beams of shisham wood, which have now turned black after so many centuries. The whole of the exterior is elaborately ornamented with glazed tile panels, string courses and battlements. Colors used are dark blue, azure, and white, contrasted with the deep red of the finely polished bricks. The tomb was said to have been built by Ghias-ud-Din Tughlak for himself, but was given up by his son Muhammad Tughlak in favour of Rukn-i-Alam, when he died in 1330. Shamsuddin Sabzwari Multani The mausoleum of Shamsuddin Sabzwari Multani ibn Pir Sayed Salahuddin located about half a mile to the east of the Fort site, on the high bank of the old bed of the River Ravi near Aam-Khas Garden was born in 1165. He died in 1276 and the shrine was built by his grandson in 1330. The tomb is square, in height surmounted by a hemispherical dome. It is decorated with ornamental glazed tiles. Mausoleum of Shah Gardez Within the city of Multan, Pakistan there is a shrine of Muhammad Shah Yusaf Gardezi, commonly known as Shah Gardez, just inside the Bohar Gate. It is a rectangular domeless building decorated with glazed tiles, a work of considerable beauty. He came to Multan in 1088 and revitalized the then-dead city. Shah Yousaf Gardez converted many people to Islam and allegedly performed numerous miracles which can be found in history books. His descendants are known as Gardezis and are one of the few old noble families in the country. The famous historian Arnold J. Toynbee in his book \\"Between Oxus and Jumna\\" writes, \\"‚Ä¶the tomb under whose shadow I am now writing ... is the tomb of Shah Yousaf Gardezi. I am being entertained in the Gardezi family's 'Dewan-Khanah', their family guest house, and the tomb, with the tombs of the saints descendants clustering round it, is only a stone's-throw away. Being named Joseph, I (like Stalin) am this saint's namesake, but I cannot claim also to be a 'Shah'; for, in Pakistan, 'Shah' signifies a Sayid: that is to say, a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad. The legend declares that, nine hundred years ago, Shah Yousaf Gardezi came riding into Multan on a lion, with a live snake for a whip and a pair of pigeons fluttering over his head. He had ridden his lion all the way from Gardez in Afghanistan, and he had brought with him the teaching of the Twelve-Imam branch of Shi'ah sect of Islam (the form of Shi'ism that today is the national religion of Persia). In the course of Nine Hundred years, both the saint's descendants and the pigeon's descendants have multiplied exceedingly. This whole quarter of the city (Multan) is now occupied by the houses of the Gardezis and the Gardezis' cousins' cousins. As for the Pigeons, they live on the Gardezis' roofs and cluster, in force, on the Gardezis' Saintly ancestor's tomb. The tomb is cased in blue tiles, dating from the reign of Mughal Emperor Humayun, and at intervals there are apertures in the tile works, opening into cavities specially provided to give the pigeons a lodging as close as possible to the spot where the saint's body lies. It is a pretty sight to see them poking in and out, for all the world as if the tomb has been built solely for their benefits. The pigeons flutter here below. The kites soar there, up aloft, at what looks almost like jet-plane altitude when one lifts up ones eye towards the sky. Since this is the Indian Subcontinent, the kites do not make pigeons their prey. They take their cue from the local human beings and leave the pigeons alone. Nine hundred years of unbroken family history. What a sheet- anchor for the fortunate Gardezis in this swiftly changing world.\\" Mausoleum of Musa Pak Shaheed The Mausoleum of Syed Musa Pak Shaheed is inside the Pak Gate. Shaikh Abul Hassab Musa Pak Shaheed was a descendant of Abdul Qadir Jillani and was born in Uch. The Shrine of Musa Pak Shaheed is frequented by a large number of people from all parts of Pakistan. Mausoleum of Hafiz Muhammad Jamal Multani The mausoleum is situated near Aam Khas garden outside Daulat Gate, Multan. The tomb has been built within a wall resembling a fortification. The tomb lies on a platform of marble and is surrounded by an area paved with marble and black slate. On the North and West side there is an arched corridor which looks like a tunnel. On the south side there is an extensive congregational hall, whose timber roof is embellished with decorative work. Hafiz Muhammad Jamal was born in Multan about 1747 AD (1160 AH). His father's name was Hafiz Muhammad Yusuf, that of his grand father Hafiz Abdul Rashid. He belonged to Awan tribe. He memorized the Holy Qur'an when he was still very young. He also studied religious and philosophical sciences. In the student days he used to excel and no one could oppose him in debates. As he advanced in years he felt attracted towards mystical meditation. He found a perfect guide and became disciple of Qibla-e-Aalam Nur Muhammad Maharvi, a prominent sufi saint of Chishti order. Hafiz Muhammad Jamal also learnt and mastered martial arts. Not merely an expert archer himself, he also used to instruct and train the soldiers. He was a unique sufi saint who was an eminent scholar, poet and a warrior as well. He used to fight and lead soldiers of Nawab Muzaffar Khan, ruler of Multan, against forces of Ranjeet Singh who attacked the city many times yet could not capture the fort and city during the lifetime of Hafiz Jamal. The most reliable source of life history of Hafiz Muhammad Jamal is the book 'Jamalia\\" written by Maulvi Abdul Aziz Parharvi. As described in the book, Hafiz Muhammad Jamal was radiantly handsome, his teeth were unstrung pearls, his nose marvelously comely, his eyebrows thin, his chin pointed and his beard was extremely graceful. He used to walk at such a pace that young men were unable to keep up with him. He had a ring, upon which were engraved the words \\"Allahu jamilun wa yohibbul jamal' (God is beautiful and loves beauty). His discourse used to be most sweet and agreeable. In his life there was no contradiction between preaching and practice. History testifies that very many Hindus also benefited from his teachings and he never acted in a discriminatory way towards them. It is undoubtedly true that after the great Bahauddin Zakariyya Multani it was the Suhrawardi order which flourished in the region. Hafiz Jamal was the first saint to give currency to the Chishti order of sufism in Multan. He also established a very important centre of learning. Hafiz Jamal died at the age of 66 on 5 Jamadi ul Sani 1226 (7 May 1811). A chronogram for the date of his death was derived by his beloved pupil Munshi Ghulam Hassan from these words of Holy Qur'an: \\"innl muttaqin fi jannat\\". Two other chronograms in Persian verses are also inscribed over the eastern gate of the tomb. He married twice and one of his wives was from Laang family. He had a considerable number of spiritual successors such as Khwaja Khuda Bakhsh of Khairpur Tamiwali. Hafiz Jamal was an excellent poet in Arabic, Persian and Saraiki. His \\"Seeharfi\\" is a poem in Saraiki which comprises 29 stanzas of four rhyming lines each, the fourth containing the poet's name 'Jamal'. In this Hafiz Jamal uses the spinning wheel and its appurtenances as symbols of deeds and character. Copy of this 'Seeharfi' is available in the Punjab University Library. It was also once published in Agra, India. Very many accounts of Hafiz Jamal and his sayings were composed, many of which exist in the earlier books. The best known are i) 'Fazail Raziyya', ii) 'Jamalia', iii) 'Gulzar-e-Jamlia' written in 1325/1907, and iv) 'Anwar-e-Jamlia'. Now many more books have been written. Other mausoleums and tombs In addition to the tombs mentioned above, Multan has several other historical and archaeological remains of the Muslim period. Prominent among these are: Shahadna Shahaid is located near Delhi Gate and is the shrine of a faithful disciple of 'Bahaul Haq'. The mausoleum of Bibi Pak Daman is located near Basti Daira. Mausoleum of Sher Shah Syed on Multan-Mazzaffargarh Road. Mausoleum of Makhdoom Abdul Rashid Haqqani at Makhdoom Rashid Road. Totla Mai near Haram Gate. Shah Ali Akbar, a descendant of Shah Shams Sabzwari. He was the grandson of Shah Shams. His mausoleum is situated in Shia Miani Multan. Baba Safra near Eidgah. The long brick tombs generally known as Nuagaza tombs, or the \\"nineyarder tombs\\". This term is generally applied in the sub-continent to the warriors and martyrs of Islam who, at the time of the early invasions of the Muslims, fell in action against the Hindus. Outside the Delhi Gate, nearly twelve yards (351/2 feet to be exact) in length, there is a stone of chocolate color with marks of light yellow on it, 27 inches in diameter and thick, with a hole through the middle in diameter. It is called Manka. People say the saint wore it round his neck, while some maintain that it was his thumb ring. The tomb is asserted to be 1300 years old. It is possible that it may belong to the times of the early Muslim invasion under Mohammad -bin-Qasim. Chisht Nagar is a Shrine of a great saint Maulana Ghulam Rabbani Ramdasi Chishti Sabri(1918‚Äì1988) near Jahanian Mandi, Multan.

The first Waldorf schools In the chaotic circumstances of post-World War I Germany, Rudolf Steiner had been giving lectures on his ideas for a societal transformation in the direction of independence of the economic, governmental and cultural realms, known as Social Threefolding, to the workers of various factories. On April 23, 1919, he held such a lecture for the workers of the Waldorf-Astoria cigarette factory in Stuttgart, Germany; in this lecture he mentioned the need for a new kind of comprehensive school. On the following day, the workers approached Herbert Hahn, one of Steiner's close co-workers, and asked him whether their children could be given such a school. Independently of this request, the owner and managing director of the factory, Emil Molt, announced his decision to set up such a school for his factory workers' children to the company's Board of Directors and asked Steiner to be the school's pedagogical consultant. The name Waldorf thus comes from the factory which hosted the first school.Johannes Hemleben, Rudolf Steiner: A documentary biography, Henry Goulden Ltd, , pp. 121-126 (German edition Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag ). The original Waldorf school was formed as an independent institution licensed by the local government as an exploratory model school with special freedoms. Steiner specified four conditions: # that the school be open to all children; # that it be coeducational; # that it be a unified twelve-year school; # that the teachers, those individuals actually in contact with the children, have primary control over the pedagogy of the school, with a minimum of interference from the state or from economic sources. On May 13, 1919, Molt, Steiner and E.A. Karl Stockmeyer had a preliminary discussion with the Education Ministry with the aim of finding a legal structure that would allow for an independent school. Stockmeyer was then given the task of finding teachers as a foundation for the future school. At the end of August, seventeen candidates for teaching positions attended what would be the first of many pedagogical courses sponsored by the school; twelve of these candidates were chosen to be the school's first teachers. The school opened on September 7, 1919 with 256 pupils in eight grades; 191 of the pupils were from factory families, the other 65 came from interested families from Stuttgart, many of whom were already engaged in the anthroposophical movement in that city. In the following years, a numerical balance between the factory workers' and outside children was achieved; it had been an explicit goal of the social three-folding movement to create a school that bridged social classes in this way. For the first year, the school was a company school and all teachers were listed as workers at Waldorf-Astoria, by the second year the school had become an independent entity. The Stuttgart school grew quickly, adding a grade each year of secondary education, which thus by the 1923/4 school year included grades 9-12, and adding parallel classes in all grades. By 1926 there were more than 1,000 pupils in 28 classes. Already, in 1922, Steiner had brought his educational ideas to an English-speaking audience when he delivered twelve lectures at Manchester College at the Oxford ConferencePaull, John (2010) \\"A Postcard from Oxford: Rudolf Steiner at Manchester College\\", \\"Journal of Bio- Dynamics Tasmania\\", 100: 6-14. on the philosophy and practice of education and the imperative for a moral component.Paull, John (2011) Rudolf Steiner and the Oxford Conference: The Birth of Waldorf Education in Britain. European Journal of Educational Studies, 3(1): 53-66. This was followed up in 1924 with a course by Steiner for teachers held at Torquay during Steiner's final visit to Britain.Paull, John (2018) Torquay: In the Footsteps of Rudolf Steiner, Journal of Biodynamics Tasmania. 125 (Mar): 26‚Äì31. The first decade Schools founded in the first decade after the Stuttgart school include: *Cologne, Germany (1921) (closed 1925) *Dornach, Switzerland (1921) ‚Äì high school *King's Langley, Hertfordshire, England (1922) where a boarding school began transitioning into a Waldorf school *Hamburg, Germany (1922) *Essen, Germany (1922) (closed by the Nazi government in 1936) *The Hague, Netherlands (1923) *London, England (1925), now Michael Hall school in Sussex, England *Basel, Switzerland (1926) *Oslo, Norway (1926) *Hannover, Germany (1926) *Budapest, Hungary (1926) *Zurich, Switzerland (1927) *Gloucester, England (1927) *Berlin, Germany (1928) *New York, USA (1928) *Vienna, Austria (1929) *Bergen, Norway (1929) *Dresden, Germany (1929) A 1928 attempt to found a Waldorf school in Nuremberg met with resistance from the Bavarian Education Ministry, which stated that there was the \\"no need in Bavaria for independent schools employing novel ideas, especially when they had no religious ties.\\" Second World War The Stuttgart school grew rapidly, opening parallel classes, and by 1938 schools inspired by the original school or its pedagogical principles had been founded in the United States, UK, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Hungary, and in other towns in Germany. Political interference from the Nazi regime limited and ultimately closed most Waldorf schools in Europe; the affected schools, including the original school, were reopened after the Second World War.P.

Three-quarters of the Waldorf schools today are located in Europe; schools are now being established in Eastern Europe, where communist regimes forbade Waldorf schools until their overthrow in 1989. In the English-speaking world, there are about 200 schools in the United States, 70 in Australia and New Zealand, 40 in Great Britain, and 30 in Canada; there are also many schools in New Zealand and South Africa. World-wide system of schools Germany, the United States and the Netherlands have the largest number of schools, while Norway, Switzerland and the Netherlands have the greatest concentration of schools per population. Australia All independent schools in Australia receive partial government funding,Independent Schooling in Australia Snapshot 2010, study by Independent Schools Queensland including the currently approximately 40 independent Steiner-Waldorf schools. In addition, 10 schools administered by the state are currently operating Steiner programs. In 2006, state-run Steiner schools in Victoria, Australia were challenged by parents and religious experts over concerns that the schools derive from a spiritual system (anthroposophy); parents and administrators, as well as Victorian Department of Education authorities, presented divergent views as to whether spiritual or religious dimensions influence pedagogical practice. If present, these would contravene the secular basis of the public education system.Steiner education in state schools. ABC National Radio. 25 July 2007 Religion Report, I, 1 August 2007 Religion Report II A detailed. History of the Australian Waldorf schools has been written.WALDORF (RUDOLF STEINER) SCHOOLS AS SCHOOLS IN THE PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION TRADITION, Alduino Bartolo Mazzone Canada There are more than 30 independent Waldorf schools in Canada; for a current list see here. State schools using Waldorf-based methods include: * French speaking: Chambly, Montreal, Waterville, Victoriaville, and Ottawa * English speaking: Edmonton, Calgary and Kelowna. China The Chengdu Waldorf School was the first of its kind opened in China, in 2004, teaching about 500 students between the ages of three and eighteen. In total China has about 70 Waldorf schools located in its big cities. Finland In Finland there are 24 Steiner schools operating with 95 - 100% state financing. Germany In the mid-1930s, the Nazi government began to pressure independent schools in Germany to conform to National Socialist social and educational principles or else face closure. By 1937, most of the German Waldorf schools had decided to cease operation rather than compromise their approach. In 1941, the last Waldorf school operating in Germany (in Dresden) was closed by the Gestapo, as was the school in The Hague, in the occupied Netherlands.Uwe Werner and Christoph Lindenberg, Anthroposophen in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus (1933-1945), Oldenbourg Verlag, 1999, . After the Second World War, many of the earlier schools were re-established, and new schools founded at a rapid pace. A second boom in school foundation took place beginning in the 1970s. There are now close to 200 schools in Germany. Russia Milestones in the development of Waldorf education include: *1992 - The first Waldorf School in Russia founded in Moscow.Paull, John (2017) The First Waldorf School in Russia: A Postcard from Moscow, Journal of Biodynamics Tasmania. 124 (Dec): 14‚Äì17. *1995/96 - The original Waldorf School in Moscow transitions to being state funded as School 1060. *1995 - Association of Waldorf Schools of Russia is founded *2017 - 25th anniversary of School 1080. There are 18 Waldorf schools in Russia and 30 kindergartens. There are five Waldorf schools in Moscow, as well as Waldorf schools in Saint Petersburg, Irkutsk, Jaroslawl, Kaluga, Samara, Schukowski, Smolensk, Tomsk, Ufa, Vladimir, Voronezh, and Zelenograd. Some are funded by the government and some are privately funded. The Association of Waldorf Schools of Russia now has 21 members. United Kingdom Various headmasters, teachers, and schools in Great Britain showed an early interest in the new educational methods; as a result Rudolf Steiner held a series of three lectures - in August, 1922 (Oxford), 1923 (Ilkley) and 1924 (Torquay) - introducing Waldorf principles. A number of groups then formed either seeking to transform their existing schools along Waldorf lines (e.g. The New School, Kings Langley in Hertfordshire) or to found new institutions. *In 1922, a small boarding school housed at Friars Wood and located in the grounds of the former Royal Palace of the Plantagenet Kings of England at Kings Langley, in Hertfordshire, became the first school in the United Kingdom to seek to transform itself along Waldorf lines. However, while the transformation process began in 1922, it took a decade and a half to complete. During that time the school added extensive new buildings, opening fully in 1949 when it became known as 'The New School' Kings Langley (in an attempt not to be confused with nearby Kings Langley Grammar School - now Kings Langley Secondary School). Today, nearly sixty years on, 'The New School' has changed its name, and is simply known as Rudolf Steiner School Kings Langley. *In 1925, a school was founded near London but relocated during World War II to Minehead and again after the war to Forest Row, Sussex, in the process changing its name to Michael Hall. The school is therefore recognized as the first Waldorf school in Britain. *In 1934 a small Steiner school was founded in Ilkeston, Michael House school *Wynstones School in Gloucester was founded by a small group of English teachers in 1935. Several prominent German Waldorf school teachers fleeing the Nazi regime supported the school's development in its early years, including Walter Johannes Stein, Ernst Lehrs, Eugen Kolisko and Bettina Mellinger. *Edinburgh Steiner School in Edinburgh, Scotland was also founded around 1935. These four, which grew to become comprehensive schools for ages 12 through 18, became the mainstay of the Waldorf movement in Britain for many years, and they remain the only British schools to provide education up until age 18. In 1938, a small group of refugees from the Nazis, led by Karl Konig, founded the first school (in Britain) providing special education on Waldorf principles. These Steiner special schools, part of the Camphill movement of communities for the handicapped, spread widely throughout Britain and, later, in many other countries in the world. Beginning in the late 1940s, further schools were founded, including * Elmfield school in Stourbridge An increase in new schools occurred in the 1970s, and another in the 1990s, continuing today. After repeated initiatives to open a school in London; there are now four such schools: *St. Paul's school, in Islington *St. Michael Steiner school *Greenwich Steiner school, in Greenwich *Waldorf School of South West London, in Streatham In July 2008, the Hereford Waldorf School in Much Dewchurch, Herefordshire, U.K. secured funding to become a state-funded academy specializing in the natural environment, to be known as The Steiner Academy Hereford. There are now about 40 Waldorf/Steiner schools in Great Britain and Ireland, which together make up the Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship. United States Milestones in the early years of Waldorf education include: *1928 - Rudolf Steiner School of New York City becomes the first Waldorf School in the US. *1941 - Kimberton Waldorf School is founded in Pennsylvania. *1947 - The Waldorf School of Garden City is created as part of Adelphi University. *1942 - High Mowing Waldorf School, a boarding high school in Wilton, New Hampshire opens. Three more Waldorf schools were founded in the 1950s, and five in the 1960s. In 1968 the original Association of Waldorf Schools was founded with these twelve schools. With the 1970s came expansive growth leading to the more than 250 schools and early childhood programs today . Thirty-seven new high schools have been started in the last decade. The growth of Waldorf schools in the U.S. has followed a smooth curve, roughly doubling every ten years.Stephen K. Sagarin, Promise and compromise: A history of Waldorf schools in the United States, 1928--1998, Ph. D. thesis, Columbia University, 2004. In the 1990s, the first public Waldorf school was established when a principal of an inner-city public school in Milwaukee became interested in using Waldorf methods. The school is now known as the Urban Waldorf Elementary School of Milwaukee. The next public school to incorporate Waldorf methodology was the John Morse Waldorf Method Magnet School in Sacramento, California. A number of public school systems in other cities, including Los Angeles, have also established public Waldorf schools. Waldorf charter schools have been established in California and Arizona. In the 1990s, a Waldorf school was established in the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota as a bridge between the traditional spirituality of Native Americans and modern American society. The U.S., Canadian and Mexican schools are represented by the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America. Waldorf and Steiner are registered and protected names, and in the United States, the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA) protects this usage. Schools that use substantial portions of the methodology of Waldorf education but are not independent enough to apply all of the latter's principles refer to themselves as Waldorf-method, or \\"Waldorf Inspired\\" schools; these are primarily found as charter schools which are part of the public school system in the United States and, as government schools, are not included in the above figures. As of 2011 there are 44 publicly funded Waldorf schools in the United States; some of these are state-run public schools, while 18list of charter schools in the USA are charter schools. * The first US public Waldorf school, the Milwaukee Urban Waldorf School, began using Waldorf methods in 1991; since switching to Waldorf methods, the school showed an increase in parental involvement, a reduction in suspensions, improvements in standardized test scores for both reading and writing (counter to the district trend), while expenditures per pupil were below many regular district programs.Dr. Richard R. Doornek, Educational Curriculum specialist with the Milwaukee Public Schools quoted in Phaizon Rhys Wood, Beyond Survival: A Case Study of the Milwaukee Urban Waldorf School, dissertation, School of Education, University of San Francisco, 1996 * The country's first public Waldorf high school, the George Washington Carver School of Arts and Sciences, was founded in Sacramento, CA in 2008. Over the school's first three years, test scores rose dramatically; from 67% of 11th graders scoring below or far below basic standards to 12% doing so. The school's teachers also prefer the new approach. * Waldorf students tend to score considerably below district peers in the early years of elementary education and equal to, or in some cases considerably above, district peers by eighth grade. Some charter and public schools have responded to this data by increasing the schools' focus on academic learning in the early grades. * California has more publicly funded Waldorf schools than any other US state. Internal organization The majority of Waldorf schools are independent, so each school may have different structures and policies. As a general rule, however, independent Waldorf schools are administered through the collaborative leadership of teachers. The primary governing body is thus a College or Council of Teachers working to provide at least the pedagogical direction. In some countries, including the United States, Boards of Trustees are responsible for other aspects of administration, particularly ensuring the schools' financial and legal soundness. A move towards shared responsibility of governance with the hiring of administrators, particularly an Administrative Chair and Finance Chair, who work in conjunction with the Faculty Chair to create the Leadership Team, has seen traction and schools are finding individual balances of structure and governance between the collaborative teachers groups and the administrators. Much of the compliance with legal frameworks and the traditional responsibilities of a Human Resources Department are being shifted to these administrators, along with traditional school needs such as Admissions/Enrollment, systems and protocols. A number of schools in the United States (Waldorf public and charter programs), England (Steiner Academies), New Zealand, and Australia (Steiner stream) have close links with or are overseen by State education authorities.

The north end of the beach is known for rough surf and is unofficially called \\"the dumpers\\". The dumpers, excluding the roughest waves at the far north end of the beach, are a popular bodysurfing spot for strong, confident swimmers, except during particularly rough surf or at king tide. Swimmers risk getting violently pounded onto the sand by a wave, or \\"chundered\\" (usually kayaking terminology) by waves dumping into a deep trench along the shoreline, but can generally avoid getting chundered by moving towards dry land or ducking under the break of the wave and swimming back to shore in smaller waves.

EiffelStudio includes a combination of tools integrated under a single user interface: compiler, interpreter, debugger, browser, metrics tool, profiler, diagram and code inspector tool. The user interface rests on a number of specific UI paradigms, in particular \\"pick-and-drop\\" for effective browsing. EiffelStudio is available on a number of platforms including Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Solaris, VMS, RaspberryPi. The source is available under GPL; other commercial licenses are also available. EiffelStudio version 7.2, showing Editor, Features, and Diagram panes Status, license and community process EiffelStudio is an open-source development with beta versions of the next release made regularly available. The Eiffel community actively participates in its development; its official website is Eiffel.org, where projects and resources are listed. The source code base is usually available for check-out via Subversion or Git. Also available are discussion forums and the like. Compilation technology EiffelStudio uses a specific compilation technology known as Melting Ice (claimed by Eiffel Software as a trademark) which integrates compilation proper with interpretation of the elements changed since the last compilation, for very fast turnaround (recompilation time proportional to the size of the change, not the size of the overall program). Although such \\"melted\\" programs can be delivered, the common practice is to perform a \\"finalization\\" step before release. Finalization is a highly optimized form of compilation, which takes longer but generates optimized executables. The interpreter part of EiffelStudio relies on a bytecode-oriented virtual machine. The compiler generates either C or .NET CIL (Common Intermediate Language). Round-trip engineering The Diagram Tool of EiffelStudio provides a graphical view of software structures. It can be used in both * Forward engineering, as a design tool for producing software from graphical descriptions. * Reverse engineering, automatically producing graphical representations of existing program texts. The tool guarantees integrity of changes made in either style, for full \\"roundtrip engineering\\". The graphical notation is either BON (the Business Object Notation, see bibliography) or UML. BON is the default. User interface paradigm EiffelStudio makes it possible to display many different views of classes and features: text view (full program text), contract view (interface only, with contracts), flat view (which includes inherited features), clients (all the classes and features that use a given class or feature), inheritance history (what happens to a feature up and down the inheritance structure) and many others. EiffelStudio relies on an original user interface paradigm based on \\"development objects\\", \\"pebbles\\" and \\"holes\\". In the same way that object-oriented in Eiffel deal with objects during execution, developers deal with abstractions representing classes, features, breakpoints (for debugging), clusters (groups of classes) and other development objects. A development object in EiffelStudio can be selected (picked) wherever it appears in the interface, and regardless of its visual representation (name of the object, visual symbol or other). To pick a development object it suffices to right-click on it. The cursor then changes into a special symbol or pebble corresponding to the type of the object: \\"bubble\\" (ellipse) for a class, dot for a breakpoint, cross for a feature etc. As you move the cursor a line is displayed from the original object to the current position. You can then drop the pebble into any matching place: either an icon representing a hole with the same overall shape (class hole, breakpoint hole, feature hole etc.) or a window with a compatible type. The effect of dropping a pebble into a tool is to retarget the entire tool to the development object that was \\"picked\\". For example, a class tool will now display the chosen class, in whatever view (text, contract, flat etc.) was selected. This is known as the \\"Pick-and-Drop\\" paradigm. The combination of multiple views and Pick-and-Drop makes it possible to browse quickly through complex systems, and to follow the sometimes extended transformations that features undergo under inheritance: renaming, redefinition, undefinition. Unit and integration testing EiffelStudio includes an integrated testing facility called EiffelStudio AutoTest , whereby developers may build simple to sophisticated unit and integration testing suites. The EiffelStudio AutoTest facilities enable the developer to execute and test Eiffel class code from the feature level (e.g. unit testing) to entire class systems (e.g. integration). As such, execution of this code also executes the contracts of the features and attributes executed. As such, EiffelStudio AutoTest is a means to exercising the \\"tests\\" or assumptions of the Design by Contract conditions. Therefore, unit and integration testing need not re-test through means of assertions or test oracles what has already been coded as specification in the contracts of the class text. EiffelStudio AutoTest provides the user with three methods of test case creation. First, for manually created tests EiffelStudio AutoTest creates a test class containing a framework for the test. The user needs only supply the test code itself. Second, EiffelStudio AutoTest provides a method for creating a new test based on an application failure at runtime. This type of test is called extracted. If while running the target system, an unexpected failure occurs, EiffelStudio AutoTest can work from the information available in the debugger to create a new test that will reproduce the state and the calls that caused the failure. Once the problem is fixed, the extracted test can be added to the test suite as a hedge against regressions of the problem. The third method of creating tests produces what are called generated tests. In this scenario, the user provides EiffelStudio AutoTest with the classes for which tests should be generated and some additional information used to control the test generation. The tool then begins calling routines in the target classes using randomized argument values. For every unique postcondition or class invariant violation, EiffelStudio AutoTest produces a single new test reproducing the failing call. History EiffelStudio traces its roots to the first implementation of Eiffel, by Interactive Software Engineering Inc. (predecessor of Eiffel Software), released in 1986. The origin of the current technology appears to go back to \\"EiffelBench\\", started in 1990 in connection with the design of the Eiffel 3 version of the language (as documented in Eiffel: The Language, see bibliography). EiffelBench was renamed \\"EiffelStudio\\" around 2001; this is also the time when the environment went beyond its Unix origins to target Windows and other platforms. Major releases since 2001, and some of the new features for each, have been: * 5.0, July 2001: first version to be \\"EiffelStudio\\" proper; integration of previous \\"EiffelCase\\" tool for graphical design with EiffelBench, in the form of EiffelStudio's Diagram Tool) * 5.1, December 2001: first version to support .NET (press release (PDF)).

Code analyzer Code analyzer (former Inspector Eiffel) is an automated Eiffel software testing and static analysis program released by Eiffel Software, originally produced as a result of a Masters Thesis project at ETH Zurich. Code analyzer is a Rule-based static code analysis tool which operates both from an embedded mode within EiffelStudio and from command line. It utilizes the abstract syntax tree (AST) produced by the Eiffel compiler and then generates a control flow graph (CFG), which is computed by a module of code in the tool. The CFG and AST are then visited by a number of defined rules. Violations of any rule are reported to the user as Errors, Warnings, or Hints. Each rule violation reports precisely which rule was violated.

The project included a number of technology development programs conducted by the joint NASA- industry ERAST Alliance. The project was formally terminated in 2003. Program overview According to NASA, \\"ERAST was a multiyear effort to develop the aeronautical and sensor technologies for a new family of remotely piloted aircraft intended for upper atmospheric science missions. Designed to cruise at slow speeds for long durations at altitudes of 60,000 to 100,000 ft, such aircraft could be used to collect, identify, and monitor environmental data to assess global climate change and assist in weather monitoring and forecasting. They also could serve as airborne telecommunications platforms, performing functions similar to communications satellites at a fraction of the cost of lofting a satellite into space.\\" The ERAST program was sponsored by the Office of Aeronautics and Space Transportation Technology at NASA Headquarters, and was managed by NASA Dryden Flight Research Center. The NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California, headed the sensor technology development. The NASA Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio, and NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia, contributed expertise in the areas of propulsion, structures, and systems analysis. Several small high-technology aeronautical development firms, including ALTUS developer General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., were teamed with NASA in the ERAST Alliance to work towards common goals of the program.\\" Industry partners in the ERAST Alliance included Aurora Flight Sciences, AeroVironment, General Atomics, Scaled Composites, Thermo-Mechanical Systems, Hyperspectral Sciences, and Longitude 122 West. The ERAST project was one of three, large scale aeronautics industry partnerships launched by NASA Headquarters between 1992 and 1994.Research on the Implementation of the NASA Joint Sponsored Research Program and Other Innovative Mechanisms for Commercializing NASA Funded Technologies, NASA-CR-205083 The partnerships were based on the industry model for multi-party, R&D; partnerships, initially proposed for NASA Space Commercialization programs based on the US Department of Commerce's precedent established for the Semiconductor industry, Sematech.NASA Space Commercialization, Outreach Program Plan,SRI International Project 6569 Report to NASA, January 1984, Page 28 The ERAST project used the innovative Joint Sponsored Research Agreement (JSRA), adopted by NASA officials to satisfy technology commercialization policy objectives and credited by the ERAST participants as a key enabler of the technical success of the program. The JSRA was based on NASA's Space Act Agreement Authority, which permitted flexible teaming, cost-sharing and intellectual property sharing to maximize collaboration for rapid technology development progress. The Federal contribution to ERAST was reported at $42.2 million while the private sector contribution was reported at $30,000 along with in-kind contributions of personnel, equipment and background intellectual property.JSRA Agreements Summary Report to NASA, February 18, 1996 The ERAST JSRA was one of three aeronautics partnership agreements designed by American Technology Alliances (AmTech). AmTech served as the ERAST facilitator and partnership manager for the duration of the project. The types of science mission ERAST prepares for can include remote sensing for Earth sciences studies, hyperspectral imaging for agriculture monitoring, tracking of severe storms, and serving as telecommunications relay platforms. A parallel effort headed by Ames developed lightweight, microminiaturized sensors that can be carried by these aircraft for environmental research and Earth monitoring. Additional technologies considered by the ERAST Alliance include lightweight materials, avionics, aerodynamics, and other forms of propulsion suitable for extreme altitudes and duration. Although ERAST Alliance members were responsible for aircraft development and operation, NASA had primary responsibility for overall program leadership, major funding, individual project management, development and coordination of payloads. NASA also worked on long-term issues with the Federal Aviation Administration and developed technology to make operation of these remotely operated aircraft in national airspace practical. History In 1987 and 1988, NASA conducted atmospheric ozone-layer depletion studies using two piloted NASA aircraft, a modified Douglas DC-8 jetliner and a Lockheed ER-2, a civilian version of the U-2 spy plane. However, operating the ER-2 over Antarctica, where ozone depletion took place, was regarded as risky, since if the pilot had to bail out, survival was unlikely. In addition, the ER-2 had a ceiling of 20 kilometers (65,000 feet), while ozone depletion takes place at 30 kilometers (100,000 feet), and the ER-2 could not stay aloft long enough to study ozone changes during a full day-night cycle. In 1988, NASA decided to obtain a HALE UAV named \\"Perseus\\" to deal with these problems, designating the effort the Small High-Altitude Science Aircraft (SHASA) program. Perseus was designed by a startup company named Aurora Flight Sciences of Manassas, Virginia. The Perseus design effort struggled along on skimpy funds until 1991, when NASA was conducting a \\"High Speed Research Program\\" to evaluate designs for a future supersonic transport, and needed to learn more about the possible environmental impact of such an aircraft on the upper atmosphere. Funds became available to procure a few aircraft. Other government agencies were also interested in HALE UAVs, and so the ERAST effort was born in September 1994 as a high-profile item in NASA'a agenda. ERAST was formally intended to promote the use of UAVs in commercial science applications, particularly high-altitude atmospheric research. ERAST also has focused on development of new miniaturized sensor and avionics systems for the UAVs and for NASA's Lockheed ER-2. Project components and programs Aircraft =ALTUS= rightThe General Atomics ALTUS II is a civilian variant of the MQ-1 Predator UAV designed for scientific research missions. One of the two ALTUS aircraft, ALTUS II, was built under the ERAST program and has participated in a number of the related research missions. The ALTUS II made its first flight on May 1, 1996. With its engine at first augmented by a single-stage turbocharger, the ALTUS II reached an altitude of 37,000 ft during its first series of development flights at Dryden in August, 1996. In October of that year, the ALTUS II was flown in an Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM-UAV) study in Oklahoma conducted by Sandia National Laboratories for the Department of Energy. During the course of those flights, the ALTUS II set a single-flight endurance record for remotely operated aircraft of more than 26 hours. In October 1996, ALTUS II set an endurance record for UAVs carrying science payloads. The vehicle spent more than 24 hours at the required altitude during an ARM-UAV. After major modifications and upgrades, including installation of a two-stage turbocharger in place of its original single-stage unit, a larger fuel tank and additional intercooling capacity, the ALTUS II returned to flight status in the summer of 1998. The goal of its development test flights was to reach one of the major ERAST Level 2 performance milestones, to fly a gasoline-fueled, piston-engine remotely piloted aircraft for several hours at an altitude at or near 60,000 feet. On March 5, 1999, The ALTUS II maintained flight at or above 55,000 feet for three hours, reaching a maximum density altitude of 57,300 feet during the mission. =Pathfinder, Centurion, and Helios= Helios UAV in flightThe NASA Pathfinder, Centurion, and Helios aircraft were a series of solar- and fuel cell system-powered UAVs, which AeroVironment, Inc. developed the vehicle under the ERAST program. Pathfinder, which was designed and built by AeroVironment, is essentially a flying wing with a 99-foot span. Solar photovoltaic cells mounted on the top of the wing produce up to 7,200 watts, powering the aircraft's six electric-driven propellers, as well as the suite of scientific instruments. Backup batteries store solar energy to power the aircraft at night. Sensors and instruments =ARTIS camera= A small Airborne Real-Time Imaging System (ARTIS) camera, developed by HyperSpectral Sciences, Inc., under ERAST project, was flight demonstrated during the summer of 1999 on board the Scaled Composites Proteus aircraft when it took visual and near-infrared photos from Proteus while it was flying high over the Experimental Aircraft Association's AirVenture 99 Airshow at Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The images were displayed on a computer monitor at the show only moments after they were taken. =DASI= The Digital Array Scanned Interferometer (DASI) was operated from the Pathfinder in the summer of 1997, acquiring imaging interferometric data of the Hawaiian Islands. The DASI, which originated at Washington University and was jointly developed with Ames Research Center, had to meet the stringent engineering and operating requirements of the Pathfinder with respect to remote operation, very light weight, and low volume, power and bandwidth. =DSA= In March 2002, NASA Dryden, in cooperation with New Mexico State University's Technical Analysis and Applications Center (TAAC), the FAA and several other entities, conducted flight demonstrations of an active detect, see and avoid (DSA) system for potential application to UAVs at Las Cruces, New Mexico. The Scaled Composites Proteus aircraft was flown as a surrogate UAV controlled remotely from the ground, although safety pilots were aboard to handle takeoff and landing and any potential emergencies. Three other aircraft, ranging from general aviation aircraft to a NASA F/A-18, served as \\"cooperative\\" target aircraft with an operating transponder. In each of 18 different scenarios, a Goodrich Skywatch HP Traffic Advisory System (TAS) on the Proteus detected approaching air traffic on potential collision courses, including several scenarios with two aircraft approaching from different directions. The remote pilot then directed Proteus to turn, climb or descend as needed to avoid the potential threat. In April 2003, a second series of flight demonstrations focusing on \\"non- cooperative\\" aircraft (those without operating transponders), was conducted in restricted airspace near Mojave, California., again using the Proteus as a surrogate UAV. Proteus was equipped with a small Amphitech OASys 35 GHz primary radar system to detect potential intruder aircraft on simulated collision courses. The radar data was telemetered directly to the ground station as well as via an Inmarsat satellite system installed on Proteus. A mix of seven intruder aircraft, ranging from a sailplane to a high-speed jet, flew 20 scenarios over a four-day period, one or two aircraft at a time. In each case, the radar picked up the intruding aircraft at ranges from 2.5 to 6.5 miles, depending on the intruder's radar signature. Proteus' remote pilot on the ground was able to direct Proteus to take evasive action if needed.

The effect was first reported by Beesley, Thorpe, and Ingold in 1915 as part of a study of cyclization reactions. It has since been generalized to many areas of chemistry. The comparative rates of lactone formation (lactonization) of various 2-hydroxybenzenepropionic acids illustrate the effect. The placement of an increasing number of methyl groups accelerates the cyclization process.Michael N. Levine, Ronald T. Raines \\"Trimethyl lock: a trigger for molecular release in chemistry, biology, and pharmacology (perspective)\\" Chem. Sci., 2012, volume 3, 2412‚Äì2420. :440px One application of this effect is addition of a quaternary carbon (e.g., a gem- dimethyl group) in an alkyl chain to increase the reaction rate and/or equilibrium constant of cyclization reactions. An example of this is an olefin metathesis reaction: :image:tiemethathesis.PNG One proposed explanation for this effect is that the increased size of the substituents increases the angle between them. As a result, the angle between the other two substituents decreases. By moving them closer together, reactions between them are accelerated. It is thus a kinetic effect. :image:Thorpeingoldeffect.PNG The effect also has some thermodynamic contribution as the in silico strain energy decreases on going from cyclobutane to 1-methylcyclobutane and 1,1-dimethylcyclobutane by a value between 8 kcal/moleConventional Strain Energy in Dimethyl-Substituted Cyclobutane and the gem-Dimethyl Effect Ashley L.

Born in Bognor Regis, England, the son of a wealthy landowner, he attended Eton where he excelled at athletics, before enrolling in Trinity College, Oxford. He was the younger brother of the cricketer Algernon Haskett-Smith. Background Napes Needle on Great Gable, first climbed by Haskett Smith in 1886 At Oxford he studied law and continued along a promising athletic path, reaching a long jump (unofficial) world record of 25 feet once in practice. On a university reading party at Aber, Wales in 1880, Haskett Smith became interested in exploring local cliffs, and in 1881 he journeyed to the Lake District and took a room at the inn at Wasdale Head, staying there for two months, meeting Frederick Herman Bowring, an enthusiastic fell-scrambler some forty years older, and, in essence, becoming Bowring's prot√©g√©. Bowring had also been an athlete in his university days, reaching 21 feet in the long jump in the 1840s. By the following summer, Haskett Smith had begun to record his efforts ‚Äì which were more akin to what we now think of as rock climbing than to the exposed scrambles of previous generations. His most famous climb was his 1886 first ascent of the Napes Needle, which he accomplished, by himself, without any sort of protective devices - eschewing the use of ropes, spikes, and ladders as aids required by inferior climbers. His climbing style was muscular and gymnastic, similar to that of Owen Glynne Jones, Haskett Smith's successor - after 1895 - as leading British rock climber. A lifelong devotee of etymologies, and possessing a gift for describing past acquaintances, Haskett Smith delighted in producing rambling and witty pieces about his athletic avocation. For instance, in his description of Bear Rock in \\"Climbing in the British Isles\\", the reader divines a subtle poke at the new pastime of bouldering: \\"a queerly-shaped rock on Great Napes, which in the middle of March, 1889 was gravely attacked by a large party comprising some five or six of the strongest climbers in England.

It is located on the main campus of the university in Stillwater. The library holds more than 3 million volumes, and offers Internet access to online users through its expanded website and web- based catalog. Established in 1953, the Edmon Low Library is named after Edmon Low, a former university librarian who served until his retirement in 1967. Low worked with OSU President Henry G. Bennett to build a new library building, one that would become the center of the Oklahoma State University - Stillwater campus following the completion of Bennett's Twenty-Five Year Plan. History Though the Edmon Low Library building has only been on the campus of OSU - Stillwater since 1953, OSU has had a library since the establishment of the school in 1890. For many years the Library collection was housed in various homes and office of the University faculty. In 1894, the Library found its first official home in Old Central. The Library shared a single room with the English department. Seven years later, the Library was moved into a room on the first floor of the newly completed Williams Building. Its seemed spacious at the time. The Williams Building was one of the first structures on campus to have electricity, giving students the opportunity to now study in the evening. In 1921, the first building devoted solely to the Library was completed. It was simply called the Library Building and was located south of what is now Gundersen Hall. President Henry G. Bennett came to campus in 1928 and developed his Twenty-Five Year Plan for campus development. The plan called for the campus to center around a new Library. President Bennett worked closely with then-Library Director Edmon Low to make the plans for the new Library a reality. The pair toured other university libraries and reviewed plans for the new building as it developed. Rumors state that the two were still moving markers in the middle of the night before the ground breaking in 1950. In 1953, the Edmon Low Library, with its elegant Georgian style, opened and quickly became a focal point for campus pride. Edmon Low Library during the Fall 2008 Semester Upon his retirement in 1967, Edmon Low was succeeded by Roscoe Rouse, Jr. as OSU librarian. Rouse brought years of experience in library administration to OSU. He is best known for bringing mechanization of library routines and information services to the Library. He is also the author of A History of the Oklahoma State University Library for the OSU Centennial History Series. Edward R. Johnson became dean of libraries in 1987 and ushered the Library into the electronic age. One of the first milestones was the implementation of PETE, the Library's first online information system. It provided information about the Library's 1.7 million volumes and became more comprehensive with the addition of new databases. Today, the Library provides Internet access to its users through an expanded web site and the new, web-based catalog. The Library will be the first academic library in North America to use the Aquabrowser search front-end. Aquabrowser allows the user to \\"Search, Discover, and Refine\\" through advanced features such as the 'Word cloud'. The Oklahoma State University calls their Aquabrowser interface B.O.S.S, the Big Orange Search System. Edmon Low Library is staffed by more than 200 faculty, staff and students who serve the needs of the campus community.

It is the location of the end of the Morris Canal and there is still a segment of this basin surrounded by Liberty State Park. The giant Colgate Clock, next to the Goldman Sachs Tower reminds people of the industry that used to line the Hudson River on New Jersey's Coast. Paulus Hook is a quiet mostly residential neighborhood stretching to the west from the Goldman Sachs building. Its main streets are Essex and Morris Streets and its waterfront is along the Morris Canal, where it maintains a walkway which is part of Jersey City's longer waterfront walkway. The Essex Street station on the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail and the development of office buildings to the east have allowed more businesses to line Morris Street including a number of restaurants with outdoor seating. The Paulus Hook and Grove Street neighborhoods, unlike many other redeveloped neighborhoods on the Hudson have undergone the same revitalization with less gentrification. The Newport/Pavonia, Harborside Financial Center and Exchange Place neighborhoods on the waterfront are experiencing significant construction of high-rise towers and with the addition of the Light Rail and more ferry service the area has become a growing destination for businesses, residents and tourists. WALDO (work and live district overlay) is an area that is being redeveloped from its days as a warehouse center to an artist community. It is already home to several galleries and restaurants and development of artist housing, more galleries, a museum and stores are being planned. The former Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Powerhouse is the building that anchors this neighborhood and when it is renovated it will maintain its shell that so many locals are used to seeing.

A pre-show entertainer, known as Mad Mike, would perform interactive pranks and even balloon sculpturing works upon the crowd before the performance. Warner Bros. Movie World marketed the show as insane, crazy and catastrophic and an all-action, all-live stunt expose featuring awesome highfalls, huge explosions and sensational car chases ... and crashes!! Germany Spain Plot Since the show is live and each one is different, some points of the plot may or may not apply. The show described below is the Australian version. The show begins with the elusive silk stocking gang, a criminal duo, escaping from prison and stealing a police motorcycle and side car. Following that, the Proctor (a role that can be performed by a male or female, as with some of the characters in the show) emerges and gives a short monologue about the stunts in the performance, as well as a safety warning. The strict Captain Harris (typically male) appears to recruit audience members as part of the show, typically recruiting one middle-aged male (usually a father, to facilitate the jokes), one pre-teen boy (to which the Captain sneers \\"you remind me of my little brother! I hate my little brother...\\"), a female (jokingly introduced as \\"six foot six, muscle-bound...\\") and one company stuntman, a character named \\"Rodney\\", typically dressed in a garish ocean-print shirt and hat. Following the recruitment, four green cadets and the commissioner emerge for the morning ceremony and flag raising. This is preceded by a series of car stunts, with the cadets driving a police car, souped-up hot rod and a golf buggy. A few slapstick stunts (falling on the floor etc.) follow. Cadet Verbinski wishes to pass an urgent letter to the commissioner, but he/she is accidentally pulled up the flag pole wrapped in the flag, then falls on top of the commissioner. The commissioner reads the letter, informing him about the silk stocking gang's intentions. The \\"recruits\\" from the audience are then called upon and are positioned around the set. The silk stocking gang then suddenly appears on top of the roof, and a wild gunfight sequence ensues. Rodney is accidentally \\"shot\\", and falls from his second floor post onto a disguised cushion. The cadet responsible is then reprimanded for the action. Two other cadets then climb up the scaffolding to reach the silk stocking gang who have successfully robbed the nearby payroll building. A slapstick confrontation follows, ending in one cadet being kicked off the top of the second floor. He/she lands in a disguised cushioned dumping container, and emerges unscathed later. In the meantime, the commissioner uses a portable toilet, but it is accidentally lifted into the air by a crane and the door falls out, nearly dropping him out with it. The two culprits return to the motorcycle and a wild car chase follows, with Rodney being roughed up quite a bit. The sidecar detaches, but the remaining criminal wields explosives that scare the cadets. He first puts a bomb into an armoured vehicle, which explodes and flips over. He then passes a bomb to one cadet, who almost throws it into the audience but puts the bomb into a trash can in the end. The commissioner orders the cadets to transport Rodney to a safe place, and they choose the tool shed. The last bomb goes into there, and the explosion blasts open the side panels of the shed and seemingly catapults Rodney (most likely a safety dummy) up onto the roof. One member of the duo will shout to the other to \\"get the chopper!\\" setting the scene for the climatic finale. A helicopter with rotors spinning and machine guns firing (though with nobody in the cockpit) emerges from the roof. The cadets, as well as an \\"injured\\" Rodney, rush to man the cannons. The first shot is unsuccessful, but the second \\"hits\\" the helicopter which spews smoke and descends into the roof slowly. The aftermath is the show's biggest explosion, a huge rooftop blaze where the audience is actually able to feel the radiating heat. The \\"pilot\\" then rushes out of the door, vest blazing. He is extinguished and apprehended by the policemen, and the show ends. Gallery File:Stunt Golf Cart parking.jpgA performer parking the buggy.

She served as a commissioned ship for 4 years and 7 months. Operational history Laid down as Mormacdove under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 21) on 15 August 1938 at Chester, Pennsylvania, by the Sun Shipbuilding & Drydock Co., Hull 178; launched on 6 July 1939; sponsored by Miss Alice W. Clement; delivered 21 September 1939 to owner/operator Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc.; acquired by the Navy on 2 June 1941; renamed Alchiba the next day and simultaneously designated AK-23; converted by the Boston Navy Yard for naval service as a cargo ship; and placed in commission at Boston on 15 June 1941, Comdr. Allen P. Mullinix in command. 1941 Alchiba was assigned to the Naval Transportation Service and sailed to Charleston, South Carolina, for shakedown training. She then carried out training exercises along the East Coast through early October and sailed ‚Äî via Quonset Point, Rhode Island ‚Äî for Halifax, Nova Scotia, to take on cargo and personnel for transportation to Iceland. She departed Halifax on 22 October in convoy HX 156 and reached Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, on 30 November. The vessel discharged cargo there before sailing back to the United States. She reached New York City on 26 December, and was briefly drydocked there for repairs. 1942 The ship got underway on 11 January 1942, arrived at Charleston ‚Äî via Norfolk, Virginia ‚Äî on the 19th, took on supplies and equipment destined for the Pacific theater, and set sail on 27 January. She transited the Panama Canal on 2 February; joined the Base Force, Pacific Fleet; and continued on to the Society Islands. Alchiba reached Bora Bora on the 17th and began discharging her cargo. She departed that port on 14 March and shaped a course for Chile. She reached Antofagasta, Chile, on 29 March and took on a load of ingot and electrolytic copper. After transiting the Panama Canal on 8 April, the cargo ship arrived back in New York City on 19 April and unloaded her cargo. Alchiba circa in early 1942. One week later, Alchiba moved to Charleston and underwent a period of repairs and alterations. She resumed duty late in May and sailed for Hampton Roads to take on cargo and personnel destined for service in the South Pacific. The ship then got underway on 10 June, transited the Panama Canal on the 17th, and reached Wellington, New Zealand, on 11 July. The vessel was assigned to Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet, and became a member of Transport Division C. For Operation Watchtower, Alchiba's Division served under Task Force 62 (South Pacific Amphibious Force), Task Group 62.1, Transport Group X-Ray. On 22 July, she sailed for Korp Island, Fiji Islands, to participate in amphibious landing exercises ‚Äî the rehearsal for the first American assault landing in the Pacific theater. Upon completing this training, she embarked marines and filled her holds with ammunition, amphibious tractors, gasoline, and general supplies and got underway for operations in the Solomon Islands. The vessel arrived off Guadalcanal on 7 August, where she disembarked her troops, unloaded her cargo, and helped rescue survivors from the USS Astoria, sunk after the Battle of Savo Island. She left the Solomons on 9 August, bound for New Caledonia. After her arrival at Noum√©a on the 13th, the ship loaded on more cargo and, nine days later, commenced a voyage which took her to Pago Pago, American Samoa; Tongatapu, Tonga Islands; and Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides. Alchiba returned to Guadalcanal on 18 September. After unloading cargo to support Marines struggling for that island, she sailed back to New Caledonia (7‚Äì10 October)PT 46 Deck Log for more supplies and returned to Guadalcanal on 1 November. During November the ship shuttled supplies and personnel between Guadalcanal and Tulagi. She was anchored off Lunga Point at 0616 on 28 November, when two torpedoes from Japanese Ko-hyoteki class midget submarine Ha-10 (launched from submarine )US Navy 1940-1945, War Damages. USS Alchiba (AKA6) 28 November and 7 December 1942. exploded on the vessel's port side. At that time, her No. 2 hold was loaded with drums of aviation gasoline and ammunition, and the resulting explosion shot flames 150 feet in the air. The commanding officer, James Shepherd Freeman, ordered the ship to weigh anchor and run upon the beach. This action undoubtedly saved the ship. Hungry flames raged in the ship for over five days before weary fire fighting parties finally brought them under control. Captain Freeman was awarded the Navy Cross and executive officer Commander Howard R. Shaw the Silver Star for their leadership in saving this vessel. U.S. Navy Department Communique No. 440, July 13, 1943 Alchiba aground and afire off Lunga Point in November 1942. Salvage operations began soon thereafter. Most of her cargo was saved, and temporary repairs were in progress when Alchiba was torpedoed again on 7 December, this time by midget submarine Ha-38 (launched from ). An enemy submarine's conning tower had been spotted shortly before two torpedoes were fired. One passed close under the cargo ship's stern, but the other struck her No. 4 hold on the port side near the engine room. Although the hold cargo (500-pound bombs) had been unloaded earlier, the blast killed three men, including Everett M. Stuermer, MM2 Muster Rolls of U.S. Navy Ships, Stations, and Other Naval Activities, 01/01/1939-01/01/1949; A-1 Entry 135, 10230 rolls, ARC ID: 594996.

Once the fires and flooding were controlled, salvage operations resumed and enabled the ship to get underway for Tulagi on 27 December 1942. 1943 Alchiba remained at Tulagi through 18 January 1943. On that day, she was moved to Espiritu Santo for further repair work. While at that island, the ship was redesignated AKA-6 on 1 February. She left Espiritu Santo on 6 May, bound for the West Coast of the United States, and entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California, on 2 June. Her refurbishing there lasted until early August when she conducted sea trials off the California coast before sailing on 13 August for Port Hueneme, California, to take on cargo. Six days later, she headed for the South Pacific to continue her service providing logistics support for Allied fighting men. Alchiba left Espiritu Santo on 12 September. U.S.S. DENVER (CL 58) Deck Log and War Diary She made runs to New Caledonia and Guadalcanal and in mid-November, participated in the landings on Bougainville, as part of Transport Division C, III Amphibious Force. Alchiba returned to Espiritu Santo on 13 December. U.S.S. DENVER (CL 58) Deck Log and War Diary 1944 Alchiba continued her supply duties in the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia through late March 1944. In April, Alchiba was assigned to carry elements of the 25th RCT (Regimental Combat Team), 4th Marines, for the invasion of Saipan as part of Transport Division 20. However, during the rehearsal in mid-May she had to return to Pearl Harbor for major repairs, and her place was taken by AKA 19 (USS Thuban). On 25 May, the ship left Pearl Harbor for the West Coast of the United States. On 30 May, Alchiba entered the Moore Dry Dock Company, Oakland, California, to undergo extensive alterations and repairs. The work was completed late in August, and the cargo ship got underway for sea trials in San Francisco Bay. Engine trouble developed during these tests, and the ship returned to the yard on 1 September for further repairs. She took on cargo at the Hunters Point Navy Yard on the 22d and sailed once again for Espiritu Santo. While en route, the ship experienced more engine problems, but she reached her destination on 9 October and commenced repair work. This process continued until early November, when the vessel shaped a course back to San Francisco. She arrived at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California, on the 29th and underwent extensive repairs to her main engine. 1945 On 24 February 1945, Alchiba commenced sea trials but was forced to return to Mare Island two days later for still more work. Two weeks later, the ship sailed to Morehaven(?), California, to load cargo and got underway on 20 March for Pearl Harbor. During the run to Hawaii, the engines continued to give trouble, and Alchiba returned to San Francisco for further repairs, this time by the General Engineering & Drydock Corp. The cargo ship left the shipyard on 3 June; sailed to the Naval Supply Depot, Oakland, California; took on cargo there; and put to sea on the 15th, bound for Ulithi. While she was en route there, her destination was changed to Pearl Harbor because of still more engine trouble. Upon her arrival at Hawaii on the 24th, repair work was resumed. The ship sailed again on 8 July for Eniwetok, Marshall Islands; Ulithi, Caroline Islands; Guam, Mariana Islands; and Manila, Philippines. The end of World War II in mid-August found Alchiba in port at Ulithi unloading cargo. She remained on duty in the western Pacific through 26 October, when she was ordered back to the United States. Alchiba arrived at San Francisco on 19 November. Eight days later, she began a voyage to the East Coast, transited the Panama Canal on 10 December, and sailed for Norfolk where she arrived on the 18th. Preparations for her deactivation then began. Decommissioning and sale The ship was decommissioned at Portsmouth, Virginia, on 14 January 1946; and her name was struck from the Navy List on 25 February 1946. She was transferred on 19 July 1946 to the Maritime Commission for disposal. She was sold in 1948 and refitted for merchant service in the Netherlands as Tjipanas, later renamed Tong Jit, and scrapped in 1973.http://www.coltoncompany.com/shipbldg/ussbldrs/wwii/shipsbytype/cargoships.htm Awards Alchiba won three battle stars for her World War II service, and was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation for her service at Guadalcanal from August through December 1942. Alchiba is the only cargo ship in the history of the U.S. Navy to receive the Presidential Unit Citation. As a Citation awardee, the Alchiba was entitled to fly the Presidential Unit Citation pennant beneath her ensign, and to be saluted by other warships whenever entering a military port.

The lead ship of her class of two ships, she was ordered to be converted into a light aircraft carrier in 1943 before completion to help replace the aircraft carriers sunk during the Battle of Midway in mid-1942. The conversion was delayed and finally stopped in March 1945 in order to concentrate on building small submarines. Ibuki was scrapped in the Sasebo Naval Arsenal beginning in 1946. Background The Ibuki-class cruisers were ordered in the Rapid Naval Armaments Supplement Programme of November 1941, and they were slightly improved versions of the preceding after those ships had been upgraded during the late 1930s. After the heavy losses suffered in the Battle of Midway in early June 1942, the IJN reorganized its current building programs to emphasize aircraft carrier construction. Ibuki, which had only been laid down a few months earlier, had all work suspended while the IJN decided what to do with her. The navy ordered the shipyard to resume and accelerate construction the following month in order to launch her hull as soon as possible to free her slipway for new carriers. After she was launched in May 1943, construction was suspended again in July while the IJN decided what to do with her.Lacroix & Wells, p. 540 The navy considered completing Ibuki as a high-speed replenishment oiler, but decided to convert her into a light aircraft carrierPolmar & Genda, p. 504 on 25 August. Description as a cruiser As originally designed the Ibukis had a length of overall, a beam of and a draft of . They displaced at standard load and at (full load).Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 87 The Ibuki class was fitted with four Kampon geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by eight Kampon Ro G≈ç-type three-drum boilers. The turbines were intended to produce a total of to give the ships a speed of . They carried enough fuel oil to give them an estimated range of at .Lacroix & Wells, pp. 825‚Äì826 Armament and sensors The main battery of the Ibuki class was intended to be ten 50-caliber 20 cm (8 in) 3rd Year Type No. 2 guns mounted in twin turrets, three forward and two aft of the superstructure. The first two forward turrets were on the same level, but the third turret could superfire over the first two.Lacroix & Wells, p. 542 The secondary armament was to consist of eight 40-caliber 12.7 cm (5 in) Type 89 anti-aircraft (AA) guns in twin mounts. The ships were also intended to be equipped with four twin 2.5 cm (1 in) Type 96 light AA guns abreast the funnel.Lacroix & Wells, p. 825 Two twin Type 93 machine gun mounts were supposed to be mounted on the bridge with 2,000 rounds per gun.Lacroix & Wells, pp. 543‚Äì544 The Ibuki-class ships were intended to be armed with four rotating quadruple Type 92 torpedo tube mounts, two on each broadside. The ship carried 24 Type 93 torpedoes, commonly referred to in post-war literature as the \\"Long Lance\\", 16 in the tubes and eight in reserve. Quick-reloading gear was installed for every mount that allowed the reserve torpedoes to be loaded in three to five minutes in ideal conditions.Lacroix & Wells, pp. 248, 545 Early warning would have been provided by a Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1 radar mounted at the top of the foremast. A Type 93 passive hydrophone system was intended be fitted in the bow. The cruisers were designed to carry three aircraft on a platform between the funnel and the mainmast. These would have consisted of a single three-seat Aichi E13A and a pair of two-seat Yokosuka E14Y floatplanes. They would have been launched by a pair of aircraft catapults, one on each side of the aircraft platform.Lacroix & Wells, pp. 542, 545, 547 Armor The ship's waterline armored belt was thick over the propulsion machinery spaces and thick on the sides of the magazines. The outer ends of the fore and aft machinery compartments was protected by a transverse bulkhead. The magazines were protected by fore and aft transverse bulkheads thick. The thickness of the armored deck ranged from and the sides of the conning tower were 100 millimeters thick. The main gun turrets were protected by 25 millimeters of armor and the barbette armor ranged from 25 to 100 millimeters in thickness.Lacroix & Wells, pp. 449, 452, 456, 463, 542 Conversion Right elevation and plan of Ibuki as a carrier Ibukis two aft turbine sets, the four aft boilers and the two innermost propeller shafts were removed with their propellers; the exhaust uptakes for the remaining boilers were trunked together into a downward-curving funnel on the starboard side of the hull. These changes left her with two turbines and four boilers producing . The reduced power meant that Ibukis top speed was only .

The ship was bulged to improve her stability, which increased her beam to a maximum of . Ibukis trials displacement increased to and the additional weight increased her draft to . Ibuki in Sasebo, just before being scrapped, 22 October 1946 Initially, the ship was to have a very light armament of only 22 triple 2.5-centimeter gun mounts, controlled by eight Type 95 fire-control directors, but this was modified in 1944 to substitute four 60-caliber 8 cm (3 in) Type 98 dual- purpose guns, mounted in two twin-gun turrets, and four 28-tube launchers for anti-aircraft rockets for six of the triple 25-millimeter gun mounts and two directors (now Type 4s). This gave the ship a total of forty-eight 25 mm guns in 16 triple mounts. At the top of the island, Ibuki was planned to have a rangefinder and a Type 21 radar. In 1944, the radar was moved to a retractable mount in the flight deck near the bow and a Type 22 surface search and a Type 13 early-warning radar were going to be installed on the island. The ship retained the Type 93 hydrophone system. The ship's air group was intended to consist of 27 aircraft, 15 Mitsubishi A7M Repp≈´ (Allied codename: \\"Sam\\") fighters and a dozen Aichi B7A Ryusei (\\"Grace\\") dive/torpedo bombers. They would be operated by the ship's complement of 1,015 officers and men. Construction Ibuki being scrapped, 14 March 1947 Ibuki was laid down at the Kure Naval Arsenal, Kure, on 24 April 1942;Chesneau, p. 185 however, her construction was suspended on 30 June. Construction resumed on 30 July to allow the ship to be launched as soon as possible. She was named after Mount Ibuki on 5 April 1943 as per the IJN's naming convention for first-class cruisers. The ship was launched on 21 May and construction was suspended in July until the IJN decided to convert her into a light aircraft carrier the following month. While plans were prepared for the conversion, she was towed to the Sasebo Naval Arsenal, Sasebo, by the submarine tender on 19‚Äì21 December.Lacroix & Wells, pp. 540‚Äì541 Completion of the ship was originally scheduled for March 1945, but it was rescheduled for August because of delays. Work continued until 16 March 1945, but it was halted when she was 80% complete to concentrate on the construction of small submarines needed to defend Japan against an American invasion. She was anchored in Ebisu Bay, near Sasebo, and surrendered there on 2 September along with the rest of the Japanese military. Ibuki was scrapped in Sasebo Naval Arsenal Drydock No. 7 from 22 November 1946 to 1 August 1947.Lacroix & Wells, p. 541 Notes References  Ibuki-class cruisers Ships built in Japan 1943 ships World War II cruisers of Japan Aircraft carriers of the Imperial Japanese Navy World War II aircraft carriers of Japan ","title":"Japanese cruiser Ibuki (1943)"},{"id":"6444257","text":"Grand Blanc High School (GBHS) is a public high school in Grand Blanc, Michigan, in the United States.

It is a part of the Council Rock School District. The school is located across from Newtown Middle School and Tyler State Park, and near Bucks County Community College. The current student population is 2500 for grades 9-12. The school is three stories tall and is divided into an East wing and a West wing. Until 2006, there was no direct connection between the third floors on each wing, so students and staff had to use hallways on the first or second floor to cross between wings. When originally constructed, the school was the only high school in the district and was known simply as \\"Council Rock High School\\". As the local population continued to grow, a new high school (Council Rock High School South) was built in Holland, Pennsylvania, which opened in the fall of 2002, and \\"North\\" was added to the original school's name. When the new school was opened, middle schools were re-districted as follows: Holland Middle School students attend Council Rock South, Newtown Middle School students and Richboro Middle School students attend Council Rock North. The school colors are blue and silver, and the school sports teams are known as the Council Rock Indians. After the split in 2002, silver was given to North and gold given to South to distinguish them while still maintaining the two traditional colors of the original high school. The school and the school district are named for Council Rock (also known as Indian Rock), a rock outcropping that forms a cliff in Tyler State Park. This rock was once a council rock for Lenape Indians living in the area. A large rock located near the school parking lot's main entrance on Rock Way is a reminder of this, and it is tradition for students of the school to paint the rock in anticipation of major events such as sporting events or proms.

The series is about the boarding school adventures of twin girls Patricia and Isabel O'Sullivan. Their form mistress is now Miss Jenks and they no longer have to bear the severeness of the first form mistress, Miss Roberts ‚Äì who is extremely sarcastic and firm but can be kind when she feels like to, a bit like Mam'zelle, the French teacher that used to teach and is still teaching the girls. Plot summary The second form includes two girls who have been kept back from third form and two new girls. The two old girls are Elsie Fanshawe and Anna Johnson. Both are disliked as Elsie is spiteful and Anna is very lazy; however, both are made head of their form, replacing Hilary Wentworth who was head in first form. The second form mistress, Miss Jenks, has doubts about this as Elsie and Anna do not like each other very much, but agrees to let both of them try. The two new girls are Gladys Hilman and Mirabel Unwin. Gladys Hilman is miserable because her mother is ill in hospital. Gladys Hilman rarely speaks or joins in and this is the reason Gladys Hilman nicknamed \\"The Misery Girl\\". It takes Mirabel Unwin to find out what is wrong with her. Mirabel is determined to make the worst of things and ruin class for everyone. She was sent away from home because of her behaviour towards her younger brother and sister. Mirabel's attitude leads her into trouble when Carlotta slaps her in public for ruining a play rehearsal, but Mirabel learns her lesson and forgives Carlotta. Later she admits to Isabel that she is ashamed of her behaviour and wants to be friends with the girls instead. When Elsie attempts to convince the form to perform a series of punishments against Mirabel in retaliation for her attitude in class, Isabel sticks up for her and manages to convince the class that Elsie is not acting in their interest but is just acting out of spite. As a result of this, Mirabel and Isabel become friends. Mirabel initially declares she wants to leave at half term, but ends up staying when Pat and Isabel stand up for her and the girls decide to give her a chance. Although at first they do not get on well, an unlikely friendship later develops between Gladys and Mirabel, as they help each other cope with their first time in boarding school. Mirabel turns out to be a talented musician and Gladys a gifted actor, and the class manage to use these talents to ease the two girls into the way of things at the school. The term passes by eventfully, and Anna becomes a surprisingly popular head girl, throwing aside her laziness. When Elsie is stripped of her position, Anna takes to her new position of sole head girl with a new-found enthusiasm and discovers she actually enjoys the sense of responsibility she feels at helping others and setting a good example. When Mrs Theobald refuses to let Mirabel send a telegram home asking for her violin, mistakenly thinking that Mirabel has only stopped misbehaving because she has got tired of it, she confides in Anna, who goes to see the Headmistress and explains to her that Mirabel is in fact ashamed of herself and wants to do better. As a result of Anna's directness, Mirabel is allowed to send the telegram and Anna is admired and respected by all of the other girls for performing such a kindly act. A concert given by the girls proves a huge success, but Elsie is forbidden to take part as a result of her behaviour towards Anna when the decision was made to strip Elsie of her position as joint head girl. Anna and Carlotta both offer Elsie an olive branch, but Elsie has still not learned her lesson after being left out and sets out to ruin a birthday party given by Carlotta as revenge. However Hilary discovers Elsie's plan, and instead of holding the party the evening of Carlotta's birthday as planned, the girls hold a midnight feast the night before instead. Elsie gets into trouble as a result when her plan to expose the private party backfires. There is also a new drama mistress this year, Miss Quentin. Alison chooses to worship her (she always finds someone each year). However, at the end of the term, Alison is badly let down by Miss Quentin when she finds out that the mistress laughs at her behind her back and chose Gladys over her for the principal role in the play. She is then very cold to Miss Quentin and snubs her. At term's end, Anna is told she can now go up to the Third Form, who have heard about her success as head girl and want her to return to their year. Elsie is also granted passage into the Third Form after she apologises to Anna and Carlotta for trying to ruin the birthday party, but is told that she is on her last chance and that she must drop her malicious and spiteful attitude if she wants to stay there, and that one mistake will see her expelled from the school. Main Characters Isabel O‚ÄôSullivan Isabel is the twin sister of Pat and shares many similarities with her twin. It is suggested that Isabel is better at keeping her temper than Pat. She is part Irish and good at sport, as she is eager to play and was picked for several matches in the first form. Though there are various girls who are focused on particularly in each book, the main focus throughout the series is on Isabel and Pat. Patricia ‚ÄòPat‚Äô O‚ÄôSullivan Pat is the twin sister of Isabel. She is the twin sister of Isabel and very similar to her. They both enjoy working together, love sports, and are each other's best friend. They also look practically identical. Pat has a slightly hotter temper than Isabel. In the Christmas show Pat performs a comical dialogue with Isabel but they don't think it is very good compared to the other acts. Elsie Fanshawe Elsie stayed down in the second form for the term - she should have really gone up to the third form. She is spiteful and Carlotta calls her ‚ÄòCatty Elisie‚Äô. There is a feud between her and the rest of the form. When Carlotta tries to invite her to her midnight feast, Elsie refuses, though she wants to go and plots to ruin it for the second formers. When Elsie sees Miss Theobald at the end of term Miss Theobald says she is not up to go to the third form in either behaviour or work, though she is too old to be in the second form. This suggests she may have a learning problem or just doesn't try very hard. At the very end of the book, Elsie shows a bit of a change in spirit and is nice to Gladys, who is sad that her mother is ill. Elsie is the main antagonist of the book but isn't mentioned in any other books in the series, so it is unknown whether she really turns over a new leaf or whether she reverts to her old ways. Other * Later reprints of the book change from Carlotta slapping Mirabel for ruining a Drama class to her stepping on her toe. * Gladys mentions that during the summer she has to stay at school due to her mother being ill and having no other family, she will be the only one there apart from two other girls whose parents are in India. It is later discovered that Hilary Wentworth was probably one of these girls as she doesn't come back for the sixth form as she is going to join her parents there.

The \\"Castle\\" is a sturdy log house which stands 3 storeys tall (29 feet), with a turret extending up an additional floor (41 feet). The main part of the building measures 24 by 28 feet, while an attached kitchen area adds a further 14 by 20 feet to the floorplan. McOuat built his \\"castle\\" single-handedly, beginning in 1903 when he was 51, and finally completing it in 1915. He felled and cut all of the red pine logs himself, and hoisted the finished, dovetailed beams (some of them weighing as much as 1600 lbs) into place by means of simple block and tackle. James Alexander McOuat was born in Chatham, Argenteuil County, Lower Canada (Qu√©bec), on Jan 17, 1855. He was the youngest son of David McOuat and Christian McGibbon, both of whom were born in Scotland and emigrated to Lower Canada in the early part of the 19th century. As a young boy, Jimmy threw a turnip at an elderly neighbour who cursed at him and said \\"You'll amount to nothing and die in a shack.\\" Years later, in his forties and farming near Rainy River, he invested all that he had in a gold mine on the Upper Manitou. He lost everything, including his land. McOuat turned to trapping to earn a living and found himself on White Otter Lake, living in a rough trapper's shack. He became obsessed with what the old man said to him. Visitors to the cabin who met McOuat often commented that he would say \\"What do you think of my home - you'd never call that a shack, would you?\\" McOuat is assumed to have drowned while netting fish in 1918. His body was discovered by forest rangers, tangled in his net, near a reed bed beside an island on the lake. The Rangers had come looking for him after reports he hadn't been seen all winter. He likely drowned in late fall of 1918 and was found the following spring. His grave is next to the Castle. Sources *Barr, Elinor, White Otter Castle: The Legacy of Jimmy McOuat.

The railroad starts at Nakamozu Station on the Nankai K≈çya Line and ends at Izumi-Ch≈´≈ç Station. During the 1960s, the Osaka Prefectural government planned a route link to Semboku New Town, one of many planned communities at the time of the post-war boom. The Nankai Electric Railway was to undertake the total planning, construction and operation of the new route, but because Nankai had several large accidents in the later half of that decade, Japan's national railroad safety board forced Nankai to purchase new rolling stock and start restoration track and wayside equipment. Because of the required sudden investment, Nankai stalled on the Semboku line's construction timetable. The Osaka prefectural government, using an existing third sector company, stepped in to undertake the new railway's construction and operation.

The band released six albums from 1986 to 1994. They have reunited for a few shows in recent years, and plan to record a new album. By 1984, bassist Jim LaVerde and vocalist Mike Lee (born Mike Naeyert, who now goes by the stage name, Michael Drive) were added. In 1989, the band appeared on The Morton Downey Show alongside members of KISS and Anthrax. In 1990, Mike Lee left and joined the band Bare Bones but would appear on the Barren Cross' later releases. Music Musically, Barren Cross is often compared to Iron Maiden, mainly due to the similarity of the vocals between Mike Lee and Maiden frontman Bruce Dickinson. Lyrically, the band is noted for its stance on a number of social issues. Their songs addressed, from a Christian worldview, personal and societal issues such as suicide, abortion, terrorism, and prejudice. In 1985, they contributed to the Last Days Ministries' anti- abortion song Fight the Fight. Biography Over the years, Barren Cross has seen their share of successes since their start out of high school in 1982. In 1985, their first EP, Believe, an independent release, garnered national attention and trademarked their raw metal sound. The following year, Star Song Records released their first full-length album, Rock for the King. 1988 saw a second full-length release, Atomic Arena, this time on Enigma Records (now Capitol Records) alongside label mates Poison, Ratt, Slayer, Stryper, and others. In 1989, as a follow-up to their Enigma debut, they released State of Control, and Hotter than Hell Live!, a full production live album on Medusa Records, was released the following year (1990). A few months later, Rock for the King was reissued and has since become a collector's item. Subsequent to lead singer Michael Lee (now known as Michael Drive) pursuing another project (becoming writer and lead vocalist for the band Bare Bones), vocalist Vincent Van Voltenburg, aka, Vin Van Volt, of the Christian Metal quartet, Full Armor, was introduced as the new lead singer and took the reins for all live performances during the 1990 \\"State of Control World Tour\\" which included sold-out shows in Ireland, Germany, Austria and the U.S. Soon after the 1990 World Tour ended, the new lineup with Ray Parris on (Guitar), Jim LaVerde (Bass), Vin Van Volt (vocals) and David LaVai (drums), was to begin writing for the next record which might have included a Vin Van Volt song called \\"Pain Reliever\\". The song, a new sound for Barren Cross, was well received by audiences on the State of Control tour. The record with this new lineup would never materialize, and Barren Cross went on hiatus until their last full- length release (to date), the stylistically evolved Rattle Your Cage, released on Rugged Records in 1994. \\"Rattle Your Cage\\" featured all of the original members of Barren Cross. Barren Cross earned some airplay on VH1, MTV, radio stations, and several label and metal music compilations. For over twenty years, international music magazines have featured the band consistently. Besides six major label releases, five of them full-length, Barren Cross was known for relentless touring. Reunion On May 8, 2008, the band officially announced they would be returning to the music scene, launching MySpace and Facebook pages for the band and remaining active in communication. The band initially announced a reunion which included original lead singer, Mike Lee, but would eventually announce experienced singer, Dean Kohn, would be fulfilling vocal duties. A successful short-term reunion with a few international reunion concerts ensued, with announcements of a return to the recording studio with new music. In 2010, Barren Cross announced a special re- release of their debut album, Believe EP, marking the 25-year anniversary of its original 1985 independent release. Mike Lee has since appeared on Barren Cross' most recent live performances. In 2013 Barren Cross released a live album Birth Pangs, which is a recording of their performance at Elements of Rock the previous year.

Information assurance includes protection of the integrity, availability, authenticity, non-repudiation and confidentiality of user data. It uses physical, technical, and administrative controls to accomplish these tasks. While focused predominantly on information in digital form, the full range of IA encompasses not only digital, but also analog or physical form. These protections apply to data in transit, both physical and electronic forms, as well as data at rest in various types of physical and electronic storage facilities. IA is best thought of as a superset of information security (i.e. umbrella term), and as the business outcome of information risk management. Overview Information assurance (IA) is the process of getting the right information to the right people at the right time. IA benefits business through the use of information risk management, trust management, resilience, appropriate architecture, system safety, and security, which increases the utility of information to authorized users and reduces the utility of information to those unauthorized. It is strongly related to the field of information security, and also with business continuity. IA relates more to the business level and strategic risk management of information and related systems, rather than the creation and application of security controls. Therefore, in addition to defending against malicious hackers and code (e.g., viruses), IA practitioners consider corporate governance issues such as privacy, regulatory and standards compliance, auditing, business continuity, and disaster recovery as they relate to information systems. Further, while information security draws primarily from computer science, IA is an interdisciplinary field requiring expertise in business, accounting, user experience, fraud examination, forensic science, management science, systems engineering, security engineering, and criminology, in addition to computer science. Process The information assurance process typically begins with the enumeration and classification of the information assets to be protected. Next, the IA practitioner will perform a risk assessment for those assets. Vulnerabilities in the information assets are determined in order to enumerate the threats capable of exploiting the assets. The assessment then considers both the probability and impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability in an asset, with impact usually measured in terms of cost to the asset's stakeholders. The sum of the products of the threats' impact and the probability of their occurring is the total risk to the information asset. With the risk assessment complete, the IA practitioner then develops a risk management plan. This plan proposes countermeasures that involve mitigating, eliminating, accepting, or transferring the risks, and considers prevention, detection, and response to threats. A framework published by a standards organization, such as NIST RMF, Risk IT, CobiT, PCI DSS or ISO/IEC 27002, may guide development. Countermeasures may include technical tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software, policies and procedures requiring such controls as regular backups and configuration hardening, employee training in security awareness, or organizing personnel into dedicated computer emergency response team (CERT) or computer security incident response team (CSIRT). The cost and benefit of each countermeasure is carefully considered. Thus, the IA practitioner does not seek to eliminate all risks, were that possible, but to manage them in the most cost-effective way. After the risk management plan is implemented, it is tested and evaluated, often by means of formal audits. The IA process is an iterative one, in that the risk assessment and risk management plan are meant to be periodically revised and improved based on data gathered about their completeness and effectiveness.  Standards organizations and standards  There are a number of international and national bodies that issue standards on information assurance practices, policies, and procedures. In the UK, these include the Information Assurance Advisory Council and the Information Assurance Collaboration Group.

Early life Born Asif Karim (ÿ¢ÿµŸêŸÅ ⁄©ÿ±Ÿê€åŸÖ) in Etawah, Uttar Pradesh, India to parents Dr. Fazal Karim and Bibi Ghulam Fatima. Asif went to Bombay and later took the name K. Asif. He became a successful director. Career His directorial debut, Phool (1945), did very well at the box-office. In 1944, Asif planned to make a film called Mughal-e-Azam based on the life and times of Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great's court dancer, based on a Urdu novel 'Anarkali' written by Syed Imtiaz Ali Taj, with Chandramohan in the male lead and the then upcoming actress Nargis in the female lead. However, in 1946, before the production of the film could begin, the male lead, Chandramohan, died. At that time, Asif temporarily shelved the film until further notice. He produced the film Hulchul and released it in 1951. At that time, Asif recast Mughal-e-Azam with Dilip Kumar in the male lead and Madhubala in the female lead and began the production of the film in the same year. In 1960, after twelve years in production, Mughal- e-Azam was released and became a huge hit at packed cinema houses across India. After the release and success of Mughal-e-Azam, Asif planned yet another motion picture called Love and God, his first directorial venture to be made completely in color, and began production. The film was to star Guru Dutt in the male lead and Nimmi in the female lead. However, in 1964, when lead actor Guru Dutt died, shooting came to a halt. Asif recast Sanjeev Kumar in the male lead and resumed production of the film. During the production of the film, K. Asif died on 9 March 1971 at the age of 48/49 and the film was abandoned. In 1986, Asif's senior widow, Akhtar Asif, (younger sister of Dilip Kumar) released the film in an incomplete form. Personal life K. Asif married two times. His first wife, nigar sultana.then Aktar was the younger sister of actor Dilip Kumar. It was an marriage. Some of her children were still very young when Asif died in 1971 aged 43, and she had to raise them single-handedly.

The books are rotated vertically similar to the motion of a water wheel, as opposed to rotating on a flat table surface. The design for the bookwheel originally appeared in a 16th-century illustration by Agostino Ramelli at a time when large books posed practical problems for readers. Ramelli's design influenced other engineers and, though now obsolete, inspires modern artists and historians. History and design Agostino Ramelli, 1588The bookwheel, in its most commonly seen form, was invented in 1588 by Italian military engineer Agostino Ramelli, presented as one of the 195 designs in Le diverse et artificiose machine del Capitano Agostino Ramelli (The various and ingenious machines of Captain Agostino Ramelli).Brashear, Ronald. \\"Ramelli's Machines: Original drawings of the 16th century machines\\". Smithsonian Libraries. To ensure the books remained at a consistent angle, Ramelli incorporated an epicyclic gearing arrangement, a complex device that had only previously been used in astronomical clocks. Ramelli's design is unnecessarily elaborate, as he likely understood that gravity would also have been effective (as it is with a Ferris wheel, invented centuries later); but the gearing system allowed Ramelli to display his mathematical prowess.Rybczynski, Witold. One Good Turn: A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw. Scribner, 2000. While other people would go on to build bookwheels based on Ramelli's design, Ramelli did not in fact ever construct his own.Garber, Megan. \\"Behold, the Kindle of the 16th Century\\". The Atlantic. Published 27 February 2013. To what extent bookwheels were appreciated for their convenience versus their aesthetic qualities remains a matter of speculation according to American engineer Henry Petroski.Petroski, Henry. The Book on the Book Shelf. Knopf, 1999. Ramelli himself described the bookwheel as a \\"beautiful and ingenious machine, very useful and convenient for anybody who takes pleasure in study, especially for those who are indisposed and tormented by gout.\\"Ramelli, Agostino. Le diverse et artificiose machine. 1588. Quoted in Rybczynski, Witold. One Good Turn: A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw. Scribner, 2000. Ramelli's reference to gout, a condition that impairs mobility, demonstrates the appeal of a device that allows access to several books while the reader is seated. However, Petroski notes that Ramelli's illustration lacks space for writing and other scholarly work, and that the \\"fanciful wheel\\" may not have been appropriate for any activity beyond reading. While the design of the bookwheel is commonly credited to Ramelli, some historians dispute that he was the first to invent such a device. Joseph Needham, a historian of Chinese technology, stated that revolving bookcases, though not vertically oriented, originated in China \\"perhaps a thousand years before Ramelli's design was taken there.\\" Influence and legacy Leiden (c.1650) The bookwheel was an early attempt to solve the problem of managing increasingly numerous printed works, which were typically large and heavy in Ramelli's time. It has been called one of the earliest \\"information retrieval\\" devicesNorman, Jeremy. \\"Renaissance Information Retrieval Device\\". HistoryofInformation.com. and has been considered a precursor to modern technologies, such as hypertext and e-readers, that allow readers to store and cross-reference large amounts of information. Other inventors, such as French inventor Nicolas Grollier de Servi√®re (1596‚Äì1689), proposed their own variations on Ramelli's design. Of the dozens of bookwheels built in the 17th and 18th centuries, 14 are known to survive: in Ghent, Hamburg, Klosterneuburg, Cracow, Lambach, Leiden, Naples (2), Paris, Prague (2), Puebla City, Wernigerode and in Wolfenb√ºttel.John Considine: 'The Ramellian Bookwheel'. In: Erudition and the Republic of Letters, 2016, 1: 4, 408-409 In contemporary times, the bookwheel is valued for its historical importance, decorative appeal, and symbolic significance.

Biography Nobs introducing the Bill Evans Trio at Montreux Jazz Festival, July 12, 1978 Nobs was born in Montreux, Switzerland. After apprenticing as a cook, Nobs worked in the Tourism Office of Montreux. He later went to New York, where he met Nesuhi Erteg√ºn, the then- president of Atlantic Records. He also met Roberta Flack and invited her to the Rose d‚ÄôOr de Montreux. Later, Aretha Franklin made her first visit to Europe thanks to him. At the age of 31, while he was director of the Tourism Office of Montreux, he organized the first jazz festival featuring artists such as Charles Lloyd, Keith Jarrett, Ron McLure and Jack DeJohnette. This new festival was an immediate success, and gained a reputation far beyond Switzerland. Nobs quickly transformed his festival into an international gathering place for lovers of jazz. In 1971, Deep Purple decided to produce and record their album Machine Head in Montreux. The group was also scheduled to record at the Montreux Casino, shortly after Frank Zappa performed. During Zappa's concert, the venue caught fire and reduced the Casino to ashes. Nobs saved several young people who had hidden in the casino, thinking they would be sheltered from the flames. Nobs, who had served as a volunteer fireman, knew that the casino was not actually a safe place and acted immediately to get them out. This act earned him a mention (in the line \\"Funky Claude was running in and out pulling kids out the ground\\") in the song \\"Smoke on the Water\\", which is about the incident. Also, on the inner liner of the original album, Nobs' picture was the only one labeled with a name other than those of the band members themselves. In 1973, Nobs became the director of the Swiss branch of Warner, Elektra and Atlantic. On the live Jethro Tull album Bursting Out (recorded on 28 May 1978 in Bern), one can hear Nobs announcing in Swiss German, \\"Gueten Abig mitenand, und herzlich willkommen in der Festhalle Bern!\\" (\\"Good evening everybody, and welcome to the Festhall of Bern\\"). During the 1990s, Nobs shared the directorship of the festival with Quincy Jones, and made Miles Davis an honorary host. The festival continued to diversify and was no longer exclusively devoted to jazz. In 2004, the festival attracted 200,000 visitors. On 25 September 2004, Nobs received the Tourism Prize of Salz & Pfeffer. The canton of Vaud gave him the \\"Prix du Rayonnement\\" for his contributions to music. He has also received an honorary doctorate. Nobs played harmonica on the opening track of the 1983 Chris Rea album Water Sign. In 2005, during the referendum campaign on registered partnership in Switzerland for same-sex couples he came out publicly to support the new law. At the time, Claude Nobs had been in a relationship with his partner, Thierry Amsallem, since 1987. On 24 December 2012, he had an accident while Nordic skiing in Switzerland and fell into a coma. Nobs died on 10 January 2013 at age 76.

Objectives are to keep the prison running, keep the staff happy, keep the prisoners in line, all while trying to make money. Users are allowed to choose between a New England prison, a modern U.S. Southwestern-style prison, and a West Coast-style prison modelled after San Quentin. A sequel, Prison Tycoon 2: Maximum Security, was released on September 8, 2006, followed by Prison Tycoon 3: Lockdown in 2007 and Prison Tycoon 4: Supermax in 2008, then Prison Tycoon: Alcatraz in late 2010. Also, THQ Wireless released a version of Prison Tycoon for the iPhone in May 2009. Reception Prison Tycoon has generally received poor grades from critics. X-Plays Time Stevens gave the game only one star out of five, concluding his review by writing that \\"Prisons aren't supposed to be fun, so maybe it shouldn't be a surprise that a game about prisons isn't either.\\" GameZone gives the game a score of 5/10, praising the idea and concept but complaining about clunky graphics, dysfunctional camera angles and lack of instructions. Some common complaints of the game include bad camera angles, lackluster graphics, choppy or slow framerates, annoying music and sound, and limited help for players; while most players agreed the concept was neat. Gameplay The premise of the game is to create a functional prison complete with walls, guard towers, housing wings, dining, workout and medical facilities. The objective of the game is ultimately to turn your low security incarceration facility into a profitable maximum security prison. Funding is collected by the player through state funding, charitable donations and inmate labor depending on a myriad factors, such as employee satisfaction and inmate happiness and rehabilitation. You have the option to start with a completely blank slate in a free-play mode or with the basic layout of an existing prison with several problems that need to be addressed in the challenge mode. The challenges range from rehabilitating a certain number of inmates, reducing the number of riots and fights within the prison or simply to reaching a certain level of security. To create a prison the player places buildings or walls along a grid system by selecting which building they would like and placing it somewhere within the boundaries of the map. There are over 100 different buildings that can be constructed. Within certain buildings the player can build different rooms from over 100 to choose from, such as rooms with multiple beds within one cell or solitary confinement cells. Buildings come with their appropriate staffing, for example guard towers come with guards already positioned in the tower and medical facilities come with medical staffing. Once a player has constructed sufficient housing and basic amenities, prisoners begin arriving on buses depending on the capacity of the prison. Prisoners continue to arrive as long as there is sufficient capacity to hold them and depart as they complete their sentences. As the number of inmates increases the prison upgrades to a higher security level, beginning at low security until it becomes a maximum security prison. With higher levels of security the player has access to more advanced facilities and upgraded walls and guard towers. Players are able to click on both inmates and staff to get a basic description of their levels of satisfaction, fatigue, productivity, as well as misconduct for prisoners. Players are also able to assign prisoners to cells, jobs and activities by clicking on one of these things with the prisoner selected. Also, players can drag and drop guards to areas of high misconduct or to break up riots which occur within the prison if prisoners become too dissatisfied. Inmates Rioting prisoners being subdued by the guards. The game designers created 96 different looking inmates capable of over 100 different animations to allow for a varied prison population. Inmates have various meters above their heads which the player can monitor by clicking on the prisoners. They have levels of satisfaction, fatigue, productivity and misconduct. If inmates do not have activities, such as working out, playing basketball or performing work they will become dissatisfied and their misconduct meter will increase. Having high misconduct will result in decreased productivity and an increase in fights and riots breaking out within the prison. Ultimately, it is important to monitor inmate morale and keep it high to increase profits, as high inmate morale and sufficient rooming will result in more inmates arriving. Also, the player has the ability to suggest inmates to the parole board, for possible early dismissal. The approval or rejection of a prisoner is based upon the number of fights he has been in, the number of gangs he is affiliated with, the number of rehabilitation projects he has completed as well as his misconduct rating. Sequels Maximum Security Prison Tycoon 2: Maximum Security is a business simulation computer game developed by Virtual Playground and published by Valusoft in 2006 as a sequel to Prison Tycoon. There are three real game locations in Prison Tycoon 2, Angola (Louisiana State Penitentiary), Leavenworth, KS, and Steilacoom, WA (McNeil Island). Prison Tycoon 2: Maximum Security scored 5.8/10 from user reviewers at GameSpot. The game was not reviewed by GameSpot itself. Lockdown Prison Tycoon 3: Lockdown is a business simulation computer game for Windows. It was released in 2007 as the third game in the Prison Tycoon series. Prison Tycoon 3: Lockdown was reviewed by PC Gamer UK, who rated the game 3.8/10. The game stands with a 5.5 player rating on GameSpot. Supermax Prison Tycoon 4: Supermax is a business simulation computer game for Windows. It was released in 2008 as the fourth game in the Prison Tycoon series. This version of Prison Tycoon introduced several improvements, including a brand new graphics engine, advisers, more control over aspects of the game, such as the closing/opening of gates, tunnels, and more. Prison Tycoon 4: Supermax has not been reviewed by many professional critics. IGN's Jimmy Thang gave the game a rating of 2.5/10 and called it \\"terrible\\". Alcatraz Prison Tycoon: Alcatraz is a business simulation computer game for Windows. It was released in 2010 as the fifth game in the Prison Tycoon series. As with previous installments, the game puts the user in charge of a prison, in this case, Alcatraz Island. Objectives are to keep the prison running, keep the staff happy, keep the prisoners in line, all while trying to make money. Prison Tycoon: Alcatraz, similar to its predecessor, was not reviewed by professional critics.

Top most fragment, showing depictions on both the front and reverse of the stone. The Nigg Stone is an incomplete Class II Pictish cross-slab, perhaps dating to the end of the 8th century. The stone was originally located at the gateway to the grounds of the parish church of Nigg, Easter Ross. It is one of the finest surviving Pictish carved stones, and one of the most elaborate carved stones surviving from early medieval Europe. It is now displayed, restored to its original proportions, in a room inside the parish church (open in summer; key kept locally). It bears an elaborately decorated cross in high relief on the 'front' and a figural scene on the reverse. This scene is extremely complicated and made more difficult to interpret by deliberate defacement. Among the depictions are two Pictish symbols: an eagle above a Pictish Beast, a sheep, the oldest evidence of a European triangular harp, and hunting scenes. Scholars interpret the scene as representing a story of the biblical King David. The carvings on the cross side show close similarities to the contemporary high crosses of Iona. These works may indeed have been created by the same 'school' of carvers, working for different patrons. The stone was shattered in the 18th century. The upper and lower parts were crudely joined together using metal staples (now removed), and the shattered intervening part was discarded. Part of the missing fragment was recovered in 1998 by Niall M Robertson, in the stream which runs below the mound on which the churchyard is set, having probably been thrown down the bank at the time the slab was 'repaired'. This small fragment shows most of the 'Pictish beast' symbol, and was preserved in Tain Museum, until being reattached during a restoration in 2013. It is a scheduled monument.

He proposed the concept of the 4 Ps marketing mix in his 1960 book Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach, which has been one of the top textbooks in university marketing courses since its publication. According to the Oxford Dictionary of Marketing, McCarthy was a \\"pivotal figure in the development of marketing thinking\\". He was also a founder, advisory board member, and consultant for Planned Innovation Institute, which was established to bolster Michigan industry. In 1987, McCarthy received the American Marketing Association's Trailblazer Award, and was voted one of the \\"top five\\" leaders in marketing thought by the field's educators.  Education  McCarthy received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1950 from Northwestern University. He received his Master of Arts in 1954 and his PhD in 1958 from the University of Minnesota. His doctoral dissertation was An Analysis of the Use of Marketing Research in Product Development.  Career  Early career He was a professor of the College of Commerce at the University of Notre Dame, beginning in 1956, where he taught courses about how statistics and mathematics applied to business problems. In the spring of 1959, while a professor of the College of Commerce, he was informed that he received a one-year Ford Foundation Fellowship at Harvard Business School and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Beginning in September, he focused on mathematical applications for business, as part of the Foundation's program to \\"strengthen business education and research\\", and specifically to work on mathematical models for marketing.  Development of the 4Ps  At the time when McCarthy began his teaching career, the so-called functional school of thought dominated the discipline. The functional school was primarily concerned with asking questions about what are the functions of marketing, what activities does marketing perform, what is the role of marketing within organizations? Much of the theorizing within the functional school focused on the value adding services performed by intermediaries.O'Malley, L. and Lichrou, M., \\"Marketing Theory,\\" in Baker, M.J. and Hart, S., The Marketing Book, 7th ed., Routledge, Oxon, UK, 2016, pp 37-52 As the marketing discipline matured, scholars increasingly searched for a more managerial approach that focused on solving the problems and challenges faced by marketing managers. Throughout the 1950s, a number of different approaches to managerial marketing emerged. However, some theorists clung to the functional approach, to the extent that both the functional approach and the managerial approach co- existed for a decade or so.Sheth, J. N. and Gardner, D.M., Marketing Theory: Evolution and Evaluation, New York, Wiley, 1988 The demise of the functional approach has largely been attributed to McCarthy's contribution. According to Hunt and Goolsby, \\"The publication of McCarthy's Basic Marketing (1960) is widely cited as the 'beginning of the end' for the functional approach.\\" The 1960s represent a transitional period wherein books adopting the managerial approach existed side by side with those using the more traditional functional approach.Hunt, Shelby D. and Goolsby, Jerry, \\"The Rise and Fall of the Functional Approach to Marketing: A Paradigm Displacement Perspective,\\" in Historical Perspectives in Marketing: Essays in Honour of Stanley Hollander, Terence Nevett and Ronald Fullerton (eds), Lexington, MA, Lexington Books, pp 35-37, sdh.ba.ttu.edu/Rise%20and%20Fall%20(88).pdf product, price, place (or distribution), and promotion in the marketing mix. In 1960, McCarthy was the first to propose a marketing mix concept that resonated with both practitioners and academics. In his textbook Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach (1960), McCarthy defined the 4Ps conceptual framework for marketing decision-making, which used product, price, place (or distribution), and promotion in the marketing mix. McCarthy organized his text along managerial lines using the four Ps framework. The book's emphasis was on the problems facing the marketing manager, rather than looking at the characteristics of marketing systems and their functions. In addition to chapters devoted to the 4 Ps, the book also included chapters on consumer behavior, marketing research and market segmentation to round out the tools available to marketers for use in problem-solving. The managerial approach views marketing as a management science. It uses problem-solving to \\"develop an optimum offering of products, prices, promotion, and place (distribution),\\" according to the Handbook of Marketing. A key feature of the managerial approach is that it began to move away from its economics foundations and instead introduced ideas from the new and emerging fields of sociology and psychology, which offered useful insights for explaining aspects of consumer behaviour such as the influence of culture and social class.Brian Jones, D.G. and Shaw, E.H, \\"The History of Marketing Thought,\\" in Handbook of Marketing, Weitz, R. and Wensley, R. (eds), London, UK, 2003, p. 60 It also placed an overt reliance on the quantitative sciences as means of knowing.\\" Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \\"Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought,\\" Journal of Macromarketing, Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, p. 225 Prior to the publication of McCarthy's text, the concept of a marketing mix was being debated, however, there was little consensus among marketers about what elements should comprise the marketing mix. They relied on checklists or lengthy classifications of factors that needed to be considered to understand consumer responses. Neil H. Borden of the Harvard Business School developed a complicated model in the late 1940s, based upon at least twelve different factors. In contrast, McCarthy's concept was a simplifed, memorable set of factors for managerial planning and decision- making. McCarthy's marketing mix is based upon four controllable variables that a company manages in its effort to satisfy the corporation's objectives as well as the needs and wants of a target market. Once there is understanding of the target market's interests, marketers develop tactics, using the 4Ps, to encourage buyers to purchase product. The successful use of the model is predicated upon the degree to which the target market's needs and wants have been understood, and the extent to when the marketers developed the tactics accordingly. McCarthy's 4Ps concept is particularly suited to most consumer products. The model needs modifications for high-end consumer products, in which case relationship management is a factor. Services have some unique marketing issues to be factored into decision-making. Tactics for marketing industrial products should consider elements of long-term contractual agreements. Regardless of the modifications needed in some cases, the 4Ps remain a generally accepted marketing practice to influence buyers and its concepts still are espoused in contemporary textbooks. Further, the 4Ps marketing mix that McCarthy popularized has become a foundational and widely adopted marketing framework into the 21st century. This is partly due to the simplicity of the model, which makes it adaptable for changes in the marketing area, such as internet commerce. Rather than creating a new model, G. Dominic expressed that McCarthy's 4 Ps could be used with some \\"extension and adjustment\\" to develop tactics for the current, ever-changing marketing arena like internet commerce. Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach is one of the world's most popular marketing textbooks. It has been updated by McCarthy and coauthor William D. Perreault more than a dozen times. The textbook's 19th edition was published in 2013. Educator and author McCarthy had the Ford Foundation Fellowship in 1963 and 1964, when he investigated the role of marketing in global economic development. After Notre Dame, McCarthy moved to Michigan. He was on the faculty in the Department of Marketing and Supply Chain Management at Michigan State University (MSU). In 2013, he was Professor Emeritus there. During his career, McCarthy also held a position at the University of Oregon. As an educator, he interested students in marketing and effective marketing strategy planning. He also developed teaching materials for other marketing professors, including \\"developing and improving marketing texts to reflect the most current thinking in the field\\". He has published books and articles in the areas of general marketing, social issues in marketing, and data processing. Planned Innovation Institute McCarthy played a pivotal role in the Planned Innovation Institute as founder, Advisory Board member, and consulting educator. Planned Innovation Institute was founded to identify causes and create solutions to address \\"major causes of new product failure in Michigan industry.\\" It modeled its program's concepts after the University of Michigan Institute of Science and Technology research program. McCarthy, with Frank R. Bacon, Jr., used the concepts from his Basic Marketing textbook to develop the institute's Product-Market Analysis component that first focused on new product innovation and then business retention strategies. He traveled to India, South Africa, Latin America, and within the United States for its market-oriented planning and management educational programs. His clients included Dow Chemical Company, Rockwell International, Steelcase, Bemis Manufacturing Company, Grupo Industrial Alfa, Coredemex, Lear Siegler, the Sarns division of 3M, and United Nations businessmen in Costa Rica. Membership and awards McCarthy was a member of the American Marketing Association and the Economics Society. In 1987, he received the American Marketing Association's Trailblazer Award. He was also named one of the \\"top five\\" leaders in marketing thought by marketing educators. Personal life McCarthy and his wife, Joanne, had eight children. He died December 3, 2015. The McCarthys established the Joanne N. and E. Jerome McCarthy Endowment for Arts Education, which has supported the Wharton Center for Performing Arts on the Michigan State University campus.

History Founder Mrs. Grass was born Sophie Dreifuss, in Baden, Germany. She married I.J. (Isaac Jerome) Grass and lived in Chicago, Illinois, on the city's south side. She and her husband opened a delicatessen in 1901 and lived above the store. Her noodle soup sold so well from the delicatessen that they opened their own noodle factory, the I.J. Grass Noodle Company at 6027 Wentworth Ave, in 1915. In 1939, developments in food dehydration allowed the company to create a dried noodle soup mix. Between 1917 and 1925 they expanded to three locations, and by the 1960s, I.J. Grass Noodle Company was a multi-million dollar company. Sophie and Isaac had two sons, A. Irving Grass and Sidney Grass. Irving became president of the company, and Sidney became vice president and secretary. During the 1950s, Mrs. Grass sponsored a Saturday morning children's radio program, featuring the space travel adventures of the hero \\"Super Noodle\\". Mrs. Grass was acquired by Borden in 1986. When Borden sold its food division in 2001, the soup was acquired by Heinz and noodles was acquired by American Italian Pasta Company. Isaac Jerome Grass died in October 1925. Sophie Grass died in 1953 at the age of 74. The magic egg Mrs. Grass soup was unique with its inclusion of a self-contained 'magic egg', which Wyler's calls the Golden Flavor Nugget. The Golden Flavor Nugget dissolved as it boiled, releasing oils and chicken bouillon into the water. To the dismay of many Mrs. Grass soup eaters, the \\"magic egg\\" was discontinued sometime around February 2016.

The inscriptions were made in four languages: Burmese, Pyu, Mon, and Pali, which all tell the story of Prince Yazakumar and King Kyansittha. The primary importance of the Myazedi inscription is that the inscriptions allowed for the deciphering of the written Pyu language. There are two main inscriptions in Burma today. One exists on the platform of the Myazedi Pagoda, in the village of Myinkaba (south of Bagan), in Mandalay Division. The other was discovered by German Pali scholar Dr. Emil Forchammar in 1886-1887, and is currently in display at the Bagan Archaeological Museum. The Myazedi inscription is recognised as Memory of the World Register by UNESCO.  Translation and Analysis  The inscription has 39 lines in Burmese language, 41 lines in Pali, 33 lines in Mon Language and 26 lines in Pyu language. It can be generally divided into three categories, donation, wish and curse. The nearest translation is as follows:  Analysis  The typical Bagan handwriting was either rectangular or circular in shape, but in this inscription, the handwriting reassembles Tamarind seeds. Being the beginning of Myanmar Literature, some words were not written systematically, that is, the consonants and vowels were separated (e.g, was written as on a line, and written on the next line). There were only words for the first person,\\"I\\" and \\"my\\",in Bagan period.In the inscription,instead of \\"he\\",Yazakumar referred to himself as \\"The son of the beloved wife\\"()and \\"it\\" was referred as \\"This\\"().Some words had archaic meanings(e.g,,which has modern meaning of \\"abandon\\",meant \\"Lovely ,or beloved\\"and , meaning \\"relax\\" or \\"mix thoroughly\\",meant \\"donate\\"). Blagden, C. (1914) The Myazedi Inscriptions. Journal of the Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, pp. 1063-1069. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/25189254 Yazakumar referred to his father as ≈örƒ´ TribhuvanƒÅditya DhammarƒÅja,meaning \\"The king who can enlighten all three worlds like the sun\\",his mother as Trilokava·π≠ansakƒÅ devi (The queen who could lead all three worlds) and the Pagan Empire as ArimaddanƒÅpura Empire (Meaning: The place where they can successfully outnumber enemies) respectively. The purpose of the donation category is to let people appreciate their deeds. The wishing category is part of the tradition of Buddhism. The main intention of writing curse to preserve the donations and to prevent donated structures from being damaged. From this inscription, the reign periods of Kyansittha, Anawrahta, Saw Lu,and Alaungsithu can be calculated, old Pyu Language can be learnt, and Yazakumar's respect and love for his father can be observed.Burmese Encyclopedia,Volume 9  In Pali  In Pali language, the inscription reads: #Grƒ´.

Karnes (born ) is a former United States Marine, who with fellow U.S. Marine Jason Thomas located and helped rescue two police officers trapped in the rubble from the September 11 attacks after the collapse of the World Trade Center in 2001. Career 2001: September 11 attacks Karnes, an accountant by profession, left his office at Deloitte and Touche in Wilton, Connecticut on September 11, 2001 soon after witnessing the attacks on television. Karnes said to his co-workers, \\"You guys may not realize it, but this country is at war.\\" According to a Slate magazine profile, Karnes drove to a local church and asked the pastor and parishioners to say a prayer that God would lead him to survivors. A devout Christian, Karnes often turned to prayer when faced with decisions. Having spent 23 years in the Marine Corps infantry, he got a regulation hair cut, put on his Marine Corps camouflage utility uniform, and obtained equipment that included rappelling gear. He drove from Connecticut to the World Trade Center to assist with the disaster. At the site, he ran into another Marine, Jason Thomas, and walked with him into the rubble. At the time, he only knew his fellow Marine as \\"Sgt. Thomas\\". His full identity was not discovered until years later. According to a Defense Department profile of Karnes: The three men found Will Jimeno and John McLoughlin, a pair of police officers buried in the rubble. Karnes spent a total of nine days at the site before returning to his office. Upon returning home, he reenlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve and went on to serve in the Philippines and Iraq. He served for 17 months, including two tours of duty in Iraq. In popular culture In the 2006 Oliver Stone movie, World Trade Center, which tells this story, Karnes is played by Michael Shannon. Karnes did not cooperate in the making of Stone's World Trade Center movie due to Stone's antipathy towards U.S. President George W. Bush. Some critics took issue with the portrayal in the film. Rebecca Liss of Slate magazine observed, \\"The film seems to overplay his zeal without conveying his motivations and reasoning.\\" It notes he is unfairly portrayed as \\"a robotic soldier of Christ‚Äîa little wacky and simplistic.\\" See also *Dominick Pezzulo References 1958 births Living people People from Wilton, Connecticut People associated with the September 11 attacks United States Marines American accountants ","title":"Dave Karnes"},{"id":"6445326","text":"Alan McKenzie is a British comics writer and editor known for his work at 2000 AD.

It was the first direct-to-home satellite broadcasting service in the United States to use the internationally accepted DVB-S broadcasting standard and used 39\\" satellite dish receivers.http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Cable/Reports/fcc96496.txt FCC report on DTH with dish size and launch information AlphaStar service launched in July 1996 but was discontinued completely by September 1997 with 40,000 subscribers as the company went through bankruptcy proceedings. SkyReport.com report on AlphaStar's ongoing demise The American assets of AlphaStar was used under the auspices of the Champion Telecom Platform which used to own the AlphaStar brand.http://bankrupt.com/TCR_Public/980127.MBX Egyptian businessman buys assets of AlphaStar, and some 1996 debt offering information AlphaStar would also have alleviated a shortage of Canadian satellite capacity by using foreign (US) satellite capacity to fill Canadian needs‚Äîindeed this was a requirement for the Canadian company to obtain its license from Canada to commence broadcasting. Tee-Comm, the parent company of AlphaStar had originally co-founded the partnership that created ExpressVu (later Bell Satellite TV) as technology supplier but later divested all interest in ExpressVu. History In March 1995 AlphaStar leases 12 transponders on satellite Telstar 402R for a capacity of 110 video and 20 audio channels. On 1 July 1996 AlphaStar service launches using 12 transponders on satellite Telstar 402R at 89¬∞W in the Ku-band. In 1996 AlphaStar obtained $102 million in a debt offering, but analysts claim it could have claimed double that sum. In late 1996 AlphaStar's corporate parent Tee-Comm, owned by Alvin Bahnman, divested itself from the partnership it co-founded that created the Canadian ExpressVu DBS service, known today as Bell Satellite TV. As a result, ExpressVu obtained equipment and technology from EchoStar. In 1997 AlphaStar was in the process of transitioning to the newly launched Telstar 5 satellite with the capacity for 200 video channels and 40 audio channels. On 3 March 1997, AlphaStar announced AlphaStar Canada service with 75 channels of service (in reality only 35 were full-time video).http://www.sat- net.com/listserver/ts-news/msg00469.html Announcement of AlphaStar Canada service The Canadian service never launched as the company went bankrupt and ceased broadcasting operations by September of that same year. On 27 May 1997 the company initiated bankruptcy proceedings. In August 1997 the operator of the Telstar 5 satellite, then named Loral Skynet, terminated its contract with AlphaStar after asking to be released from the contract earlier that year. At 3:00 AM on 7 August 1997 the company ceased broadcasting operations, stranding 40,000 subscribers. Competitors quickly offered trade-in deals. In 1998 an Egyptian tycoon named Mahmoud Wahba was reported by the Investor's Business Daily to have bought the assets of the failed AlphaStar for $4.65 million. Champion Telecom Platform company was launched using the facilities of AlphaStar, providing uplink facilities as well as direct-to-home satellite internet broadband services.http://www.alphastar.com/ Current Champion Telecom Platform web site, the new name of that which was once AlphaStar, including a picture gallery of the site On 19 September 2003 the Telstar 402R satellite used by AlphaStar from 1996-1997, renamed Telstar 4, experienced a circuit failure in its primary power bus and was declared a total loss. Technology Originally broadcasting on Telstar 402R in the Ku-band, AlphaStar was in the process of transitioning to the newly launched Telstar 5 satellite and 120 channel service when the company initiated bankruptcy proceedings. A satellite uplink facility in Oxford, Connecticut was used to uplink the AlphaStar service. This facility was one of the assets of the company now owned by Champion Telecom Platform. The communications teleport was originally built for the United States government for the Strategic Defense Initiative, according to Champion, and can allegedly withstand nuclear attack. Another uplink facility was in Milton, Ontario, Canada. Dish receiving equipment for AlphaStar were large, 36-39\\" elliptical reflectors designed to receive medium- powered, linear-polarized Ku-band signals in the Fixed Service Satellite band in the area of 11.7 GHz from Telstar 402 and, eventually Telstar 5 (now named Galaxy 25). By comparison, direct competitors DirecTV and Dish Network offered 18\\" dishes. The AlphaStar dishes were originally sold by Canadian firm Tee- Comm, an electronics outfit and builder of satellite dishes that was the parent company of AlphaStar. Set-top boxes for AlphaStar were manufactured by Samsung and Hyundai. The service used DVB-S signalling and MPEG-2 video compression called Compression NetWORKS developed by a firm named TV/COM International. This system was the first United States direct-to-home broadcaster to use what became known as DVB-S.http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1995_Sept_26/ai_17505429 Mentions Compression NetWORKS technology used by AlphaStar and even more AlphaStar corporate information While pricey and inconvenient to use these receivers can be used to receive unencrypted satellite transmissions known as FTA. As AlphaStar liquidated its inventory the expensive AlphaStar dishes were resold to customers who wished to receive ethnic programming. An Egyptian broadcasting service which formerly broadcast several channels on AlphaStar offered assistance in refitting AlphaStar systems to receive their channels from another satellite, Intelsat Americas 5, which, ironically, was the new name of the very same Telstar 5 satellite that AlphaStar was in the process of migrating to. Though exceedingly rare, refitted AlphaStar dishes can still be found on rooftops in larger urban ethnic communities and their large size offers great signal quality.
