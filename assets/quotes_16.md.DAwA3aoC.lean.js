It is separated from the rest of the abbey by brass gates and a flight of stairs.Trowles (2008); p. 131 The structure of the chapel is a three-aisled nave composed of four bays. The apse of the chapel contains the altar, and behind that, the tombs of Henry VII and his wife as well as of James I. There are five apsidal chapels. The chapel is noted for its pendant fan vault ceiling. The chapel is built in a very late Perpendicular Gothic style, the magnificence of which caused John Leland to call it the orbis miraculum (the wonder of the world). The tombs of several monarchs including Henry VII, Edward VI, Mary I, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles II and Mary, Queen of Scots are found in the chapel.Lindley (2003); p. 208 The chapel has also been the mother church of the Order of the Bath since 1725, and the banners of members hang above the stalls.  History  Exterior of the chapel In the 13th century, a movement toward devotion to the Virgin Mary inspired the building of chapels in her honour across Europe. Henry III‚Äôs Lady Chapel at Westminster Abbey was part of this trend. In 1502, Henry VII planned a new chapel. The old one was demolished in 1502 and construction of the new foundation began January 24, 1503.Lindley (2003); p. 203 Henry VII had three goals when planning his chapel. The first was to build a shrine to honour and hold the body of Henry VI, who was expected to be canonized.Trowles (2008); p. 125 Ultimately, canonization did not occur and Henry VII and his wife, Elizabeth of York, were interred in the tomb intended for Henry VI.Lindley (2003); p. 205 Second, Henry VII wished to dedicate a more elaborate chapel to the Virgin to replace the older, simpler structure; and third, he wanted a royal mausoleum for him, his family, and his heirs at an important religious site that would enhance his legitimacy as king and his legacy.Trowles (2008); p. 126 Henry VII allocated more than ¬£14,000 for its construction between 1503 and 1509. In his will, he stipulated that more funds were to be provided as needed. The final cost of the chapel is estimated at ¬£20,000. According to one nobleman, Lord Bacon, ‚ÄúHe lieth at Westminster in one of the stateliest and daintiest monuments of Europe‚Ä¶So that he dwelleth more richly dead in the monument of his tomb than he did alive at Richmond or in any of his palaces.‚Äù Farrar (1895); p. 33 In the eighteenth century, one observer commented that ‚Äú[t]his chapel, it has been said, was designed as a sepulchre in which none but such as were of the royal-blood should ever be interred; accordingly the will of the founder has been so far observed, that all that have hitherto been admitted are of the highest quality, and can trace their descent from some or other of our ancient kings.‚Äù Henry (1788); p. 33 In the intervening years, some people not of aristocratic descent, including Oliver Cromwell, were buried there, but during the Restoration of the monarchy many of those people were disinterred.Trowles (2008); p. 129  Pendant fan vault  Pendant fan vault of Henry VII's chapel at Westminster Abbey. The Henry VII Chapel is best known for its combination of pendant fan vault ceiling. Andrew Reynolds refers to the vault as ‚Äúthe most perfect example of a pendant fan vault, the most ambitious kind of vaulting current in the perpendicular period.‚ÄùTatton-Brown (2003); p. 205 Notably, this ceiling was also the first to combine pendants with fan vaulting. The fan vault is created by first dividing the ceiling into groin vaulted compartments. These groin vaults are created by the combination of arches along the wall and larger, transverse arches bridging the nave of the chapel. In the fan vault at the Henry VII Chapel, the compartments are nearly square in shape.Heyman (1996); p. 73 The compartments are then ribbed and paneled. Ribs, of the same curve and size, are cut from single pieces of stone and rebated so to best fit with the panels.Leedy(1980); p. 26 The curved ribs, extending from the same point on the wall, are spaced equidistant from each other, forming conoid shapes. The resulting conoids, however, require great compressive forces to keep shape. Spandrels usually provide pressure along the upper edge of the conoids.Trowles (2008); p. 196 In the Henry VII Chapel, these spandrels are replaced with hanging pendants. The pendants still provide the compression necessary to support the conoids and add complexity to the aesthetics of the room. The pendants serve an additional structural purpose. The pendants are cut from single stones and inserted as wedge stones in the transverse arches. By combining with the transverse arches, the pendants do not require additional structural support. At the time of the construction of the chapel, pendant vaults were very new; they were first seen in the Divinity School at Oxford.McDonnell (2008); p. 5 Other architectural features The chapel's architect is unknown, but it is believed that Robert Janyns the Younger was responsible for the design of much of the structure.Lindley (2003); p. 204 The structure of the chapel is a three-aisled nave composed of four bays. The aisles are divided by rows of mahogany stalls into the North, South, and Central aisles. All contain numerous monuments and floor stones dedicated to various nobles. Above the stalls, at the triforium level, are many sculptures. Interspersed between the sculptures are the heraldic banners of the Knights of the Order of the Bath. Above this is the clerestory, with three rows of smaller windows. The window tracery articulates four larger windows, one in each bay, each composed of these three rows of smaller lancet windows. As much of the original glass was destroyed during the English Commonwealth,Jenkyns, Richard, Westminster Abbey, 2011, p. 53, Harvard University Press, , 9780674061972, google booksLindley (2003); p. 207 the East Window, over the centre apsidal chapel, as well as the Donor Windows (in the west), in the chapels themselves, are new additions, installed in 2000 and 1995, respectively. In 2013, two new stained glass windows designed by Hughie O'Donoghue were installed on either side of the East Window. View from Old Palace Yard, in pencil and watercolour. Edward Edwards c. 1780s The apse of the chapel contains the altar, and behind that, the tombs of Henry VII and his wife as well as of James I. There are five apsidal chapels. These chapels originally contained altars‚Äîthey were screened off and intended for private prayer for members of the royal family‚Äîbut their dedication is no longer known.Farrar (1895); p. 30 Upon entering the chapel, one passes through a set of bronze gates, which are elaborately crafted and ‚Äúillustrate the‚Ä¶intense determination of Henry VII to put to the forefront every possible indication of his claims to the crown of England.‚Äù Farrar (2008); p. 131 The gates are decorated with numerous royal crests that serve to legitimize his rule. Once inside, the mahogany stalls stand out to the viewer as they contrast with the light colored stone of the walls and ceiling. The stalls also contribute the verticality of the interior. They date from different times; while some are original others were added later to accommodate the increasing number of Knights of the Order of the Bath. The stalls were designated for all living Knights of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath. When a knight was installed, he received a stall that was subsequently adorned with his crest, coat of arms, and heraldic banner, the last of which remained in the chapel even after the knight's death. These banners all remain to decorate the chapel. During the nineteenth century, there were too many knights to accommodate in the chapel and no more were installed until the twentieth century. Currently, only the most senior knights are assigned stalls in the chapel.Trowles (2008); p. 127 The altar and Henry VII's tomb were crafted by the same Italian artist, Pietro Torrigiano. The Henry VII tomb was created first, beginning in 1512. The tomb was sculpted by a Florentine Renaissance artist, thus, the style is atypical of English art. The putti on the corners are particularly uncharacteristic.Lindley (2003); p. 206 The altar was begun in 1517, but Torrigiano left the country before it was completed; Benedetto da Rovezzano finished its construction in 1526. Originally made of terracotta, white marble, and gilt bronze, it was destroyed during the Commonwealth. The current altar is based on images of the original. Two surviving pillars and two newly constructed ones support the reconstructed altar. Also significant are the aforementioned sculptures that adorn the triforium. The statues are of saints and the Apostles. According to Lindley, that ‚ÄúHenry VII‚Äôs will declares his trust in...‚ÄòAungels, Archaungels, Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostels, Evangelists, Martirs, Confessours and Virgyns‚Äô‚Äù is critical to understanding his motivation in building the chapel: ‚ÄúHenry‚Äôs belief in the efficacy of ‚Äòmediacions and prayers‚Äô in his progress through purgatory is crucial to his purpose.‚Äù That is to say, he built the chapel and adorned it with numerous sculptures of important religious figures in part to ensure his acceptance into Heaven.

It was the first National Law University to be established in India as well as one of the first in the country to offer the five-year integrated undergraduate law degree. The National Law School of India University was established by a statute passed by the Legislative Assembly of the State of Karnataka. The statute states that Chief Justice of India serves as the school's chancellor. The day-to-day management and administration of the university is undertaken by the Vice- Chancellor. Prof. Sudhir Krishnaswamy is the current Vice-Chancellor of the university. The school has an intake of around 80 students in its undergraduate law programme, 40 in Masters of Law and 50 in its, recently introduced, Master of Public Policy. History The founding of the NLSIU was a culmination of over 2 decades of effort on the part of legal luminaries such a Chief Justice M. Hidayatullah, Ram Jethmalani and Prof. Upendra Baxi. Efforts were being made especially through the Legal Education Committee of the Bar Council of India to establish a university on the lines of the Harvard Law School. These efforts culminated when the Bar Council of India Trust and the Government of Karnataka reached an agreement to found the first National Law University in Bangalore. This agreement was in large part thanks to the leadership of Mr. Vinay Chandra Mishra who was then the Chairman of the Bar Council of India and the enthusiastic support of Ramkrishna Hegde, the then Chief Minister of Karnataka. As such, in 1986, NLSIU was established under the stewardship of its founder, then Vice-Chancellor N.R. Madhava Menon. Prof. Menon was keen on ensuring that the teaching at the university was not conducted in the traditional lecture format, which was then popular across Indian law colleges. As such, he introduced the case method, which originated at the Harvard Law School in the early 1900s. He also introduced the concept of group teaching, where more than one professor would conduct classes, with the professors taking contradictory positions and arguing the various points of law. The University has since had five more Vice-Chancellors, namely N. L. Mitra, A. Jayagovind, G. Mohan Gopal, R. Venkata Rao, and Sudhir Krishnaswamy, who took over in 2019. The first batch of law students joined the school's undergraduate programme on 1 July 1988. Classes commenced before the school's buildings had been fully constructed; thus, NLSIU actually began instruction at the premises of the Central College of Bangalore University and continued therein until November 1991. The school then formally moved to its present-day location in Nagarbhavi, a suburb of Bangalore. Academics Undergraduate One of the university buildings NLSIU offers undergraduates a five-year integrated B.A./LL.B. programme which, upon completion, qualifies the student to sit for the bar to practice law in India. The LL.B. is the standard undergraduate degree in law offered in all common law countriesJohn H.

(the J.D. degree is listed under doctorate degrees) The undergraduate B.A./LL.B. curriculum at NLSIU consists of a mix of social science and legal subjects. In the first two years, the law student attends courses on history, political science, sociology and economics alongside standard legal subjects, such as torts, contracts and constitutional law. In the latter three years, legal subjects dominate the curriculum. In 2017, NLSIU radically overhauled its academic curriculum, allowing students to choose a greater number of their upper-year courses. The aim of the change was to bring NLSIU in line with international best-practices allowing students to explore areas of their interest to a greater degree. This overhaul was also aimed at increasing the number of courses offered by industry practitioners by allowing for flexible evaluation patterns. Postgraduate NLSIU offers both coursework and research degrees at the postgraduate level. The LL.M. is a one-year coursework degree. The M.Phil., LL.D. and/or PhD degrees are research degrees. NLSIU also offers a two-year residential Master of Public Policy (MPP) programme, organised in six trimesters. Candidates are admitted on the basis of a Policy Aptitude Test, followed by interview. Seats are for scheduled caste, scheduled tribe, physically disabled candidates and foreign nationals. In 2016 the UGC has asked NLSIU to change the name of MPP to Master of Arts (MA) in Public Policy. In addition to the above full-time programmes, NLSIU also offers several part-time distance learning programmes, including a Masters Degree in Business Law (MBL) and Postgraduate Diploma programmes in various fields. Admission Admissions to both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes were based on Common Law Admission Test (CLAT). In 2015, for the Undergraduate CLAT, a total of 70,000 students contested for a mere 55 seats, making the examination one of the most competitive in India. In 2020, NLSIU withdrew from the CLAT and announced it would be holding its own entrance examination, the National Law Aptitude Test (NLAT). For the MPP programme, candidates are selected through the Policy Aptitude Test followed by personal interviews held at the NLSIU campus itself. Rankings NLSIU was ranked first by India Todays \\"India's Best Colleges 2019\\", Outlook Indias \\"Top 30 Law Colleges in 2019\\" and The Weeks \\"Top Law Colleges in 2019\\". The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranked it first among law colleges in 2020. Melgiri Memorial National Law Library The Narayan Rao Melgiri Memorial National Law Library at NLSIU is the largest law library in the country, housing a collection of over 40,000 bound volumes in addition to periodical holdings.http://india.studybot.org/bangalore/national-law-school- of-india-university/http://tumkuruniversity.in/collaborate.aspx The Melgiri Library was inaugurated by Chief Justice of India R.C. Lahoti on 27 August 2005. The library was built through generous contributions from the University Grants Commission (India), New Delhi and Chairwoman Sudha Murthy of the Infosys Foundation.  Endowment Chairs at the NLSIU   UNHCR Chair on Refugee Laws  In 1995, the first UNHCR Chair for Refugee Law was inaugurated at NLSIU. N. Subramanya worked on issues pertaining to refugees during his tenure as researcher under the UNHCR Chair and in 2004 two of his books about refugees were published.V. C. Keshava, Exploring Mysore: a complete data map in a special style, V.S.R. Prakashana, 2004 Student activities The Student Bar Association The Student Bar Association (SBA) is the umbrella body that coordinates all student activities; all students are de facto members of the SBA. The SBA has created various Activity-Based Committees (ABCs) which are in charge of specific student activities. NLSIU has a total of twelve ABCs which coordinate the activities of the Student Bar Association (SBA). These committees are re-constituted every year. The Co-ordination Council consists of the Convenors/Joint Convenors of the ABCs. This Council is responsible for ensuring that the various ABCs function coherently. A wide range of internal as well as inter- institutional activities throughout the academic year are organised by the ABCs and the Co-ordination Council. These include Spiritus (Sports Festival), Strawberry Fields (Music Festival), the NLS-Trilegal International Arbitration Moot, the NLS Negotiation and Mediation Competition and Admit One (Theater Festival). Students are also responsible for the publication of Quirk, an online magazine at NLSIU, which seeks to provide space to engage in a meaningful and mature dialogue. Competitive debating NLSIU plays an active role in promoting parliamentary debate in India. The school regularly participates in many international competitions and is currently the highest- ranking Indian team in the World rankings. NLSIU reached the ESL Finals in 2002 and in 2007 at the World Universities Debating Championship. It also recently won the 15th All Asian Debating Championships held in Dhaka in 2008. Three out of the four semi-finalist teams, and six of the top ten speakers, were from NLSIU. Another boost for the Parliamentary Debate movement in NLSIU came in the form of the Cambridge University Debate Competition 2009, where the NLSIU team became the first South Asian team to \\"make the break\\" and reach the second round of the competition. NLSIU teams have also performed extremely well in the inaugural Asians BP Tournament held in Chulalongkorn University, with all three of its teams reaching the semi finals of the tournament, and two out of the top ten speakers (and four in the top 20). Since then, NLS has reached the Semi-finals of the United Asian Debating Championships held at Assumption University, Bangkok, in 2010. The NLSIU team of Anil Sebastian Pulickel and Aniruddha Basu have also been finalists at ABP. NLSIU speakers are consistently ranked at the top of parliamentary debates at the national and international level. NLSIU also hosts South Asia's biggest Parliamentary Debate Competition. The inaugural edition of the NLS Debate was held in 2002. The competition brings together participants from across South Asia. In 2011, NLSIU's Literary and Debating Society launched two new initiatives ‚Äì the NLS Union Debate and the NLS Debate Junior. Christ Junior College is also organising a parliamentary debate, in a tie-up with NLS. Moot court competitions The entrance to the Justice Hidayatullah Moot Court Hall, named after former Chief Justice of India Mohammad Hidayatullah, at the university NLSIU is the only law school in South Asia to have won the Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition twice, in 1999 and 2013. NLSIU won the Manfred Lachs Space Law Moot Court competition in 2009, 2012 and most recently in 2017. NLSIU also participates regularly in the annual Monroe E. Price Media Law Moot Court Competition at the University of Oxford.  Student Exchange Programs  Students from the 5th year of the undergraduate course can take the opportunity to spend a semester abroad as part of the student exchange program run by the NLSIU. The University has MoUs for the same with over 30 universities all across the world, including the Georgetown University Law Center, National University of Singapore and the Sciences Po. Students from a number of these universities also visit NLSIU on short-term and long-term exchange programs.  Graduate Outcomes  Students graduating from NLSIU typically pursue a diverse range of careers. A number of students opt to join corporate law firms. The average pay for these students fresh out of college is around Rs. 14-15 lakhs. Apart from working in established law firms such as Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, Khaitan & Co. or AZB & Partners, students also join smaller, boutique law firms and in-house roles. These may also include roles as business analysts in consultancy firms such as McKinsey and Co. Several students enter litigation careers, with a number of alumni having distinguished themselves in various courts across the country. Alumni also serve variously in the judiciary, whether as Judges of the High Courts or in the lower judiciary. A few students also get recruited to foreign firms such as Linklaters, Herbert Smith Freehills and Allen & Overy. Each year, several undergraduate students opt to pursue their graduate studies from esteemed universities across the world such as the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, Yale Law School or Harvard University. Students from NLSIU have been regularly receiving a number of scholarships to pursue their graduate studies including the Rhodes Scholarship and the INLAKS Scholarship. It is worth noting that since its inception, NLSIU has produced an impressive 25 Rhodes Scholars. Students have also chosen to write the UPSC Civil Services Examination and a number of alumni are placed in various levels in the bureaucratic set-up of the country. NLSIU alumni are also active in NGOs and Public Policy Think Tanks in India as well as abroad.

Mount Triglav, the highest mountain in Slovenia, is unlikely to have any connection to the Slavic deity Triglav. However, such a claim is made for Mount Troglav, the highest peak of Dinara in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Triglav is allegedly depicted as representation of three major Slavic gods that vary from one Slavic tribe to others that serve as the representatives of the above-mentioned realms. An early variation included Svarog, Perun, and Dazhbog. Later, Dazhbog was replaced by Svetovid or Veles. Triglav is usually described as a fusion of these gods. Triglav is depicted as a three-headed man sometimes with bands of (gold) blindfolds over his eyes, or a man with three goat heads. Several temples dedicated to Triglav existed near present-day Szczecin, Poland. The Polish village of Trzyg≈Ç√≥w () is where, according to Johannes Bugenhagen in his Pomerania (1517) an image of Triglav was buried in the village to protect it from the priests of Otto of Bamberg in the 1120's. During the period of Christianization, such temples and statues of Triglav were generally completely destroyed. Three heads According to the writing of Ebbo, Triglav's heads were believed to represent sky, earth and the underworld. It was believed that Triglav has three heads because he ruled these three kingdoms and had a golden binding over his eyes and lips so he could not see people's sins nor speak about them.Ebbo, Vita Ottonts episcopi Bambergensis.

It has been suggested that news of the loss of the Irish packet Royal Adelaide with 250 lives, on the sands off Margate on April 6, 1850, prompted old Thomas White to present one of his lifeboats to his home town of Broadstairs that summer. The lifeboat saw its first use on March 6, 1851 when the brig Mary White became trapped on the Goodwin Sands during a severe gale blowing from the north. A ballad was written to celebrate the occasion, the \\"Song of the Mary White\\". The lifeboat itself was subsequently named the Mary White in recognition of the strange coincidence of the recurrence of the name White in this story: Thomas and John the lifeboat builders, the name of the brig Mary White, and also the name of its captain, Mr White.

Negotiated in Ta'if, Saudi Arabia, it was designed to end the decades-long Lebanese Civil War, reassert Lebanese authority in Southern Lebanon (then controlled by South Lebanon Army and supported by Israeli troops). Though the agreement set a time frame for Syrian military withdrawal, stipulating that the Syrians withdraw within two years, the actual withdrawal did not take place until 2005. It was signed on 22 October 1989 and ratified by the Lebanese parliament on 5 November 1989. Overview The treaty was fathered by the Speaker of the Parliament Hussein El-Husseini and negotiated in Ta'if, Saudi Arabia, by the surviving members of Lebanon's 1972 parliament. The agreement came into effect with the active mediation of Saudi Arabia, discreet participation by the United States, and behind-the-scenes influence from Syria. The agreement covered political reform, the ending of the Lebanese Civil War, the establishment of special relations between Lebanon and Syria, and a framework for the beginning of complete Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon. Since Rafik Hariri was a former Saudi diplomatic representative, he played a significant role in constructing the Taif Agreement. It is also argued that the Taif Accord reoriented Lebanon toward the Arab world, especially Syria. In other words, the Taif Accord positioned Lebanon as a country with \\"an Arab identity and belonging.\\" The agreement was finalized and confirmed only after the development of an anti- Saddam Hussein international alliance. The alliance included Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, France, Iran and the United States. The agreement formed the principle of \\"mutual coexistence\\" () between Lebanon's different sects and their \\"proper political representation\\" () as the main objective of post-civil war parliamentary electoral laws. It also restructured the National Pact political system in Lebanon by transferring some of the power away from the Maronite Christian community, which had been given a privileged status in Lebanon under the period of French rule. Prior to the agreement, the Sunni Muslim Prime Minister was appointed by and responsible to the Maronite President. After the Taif agreement the Prime Minister was responsible to the legislature, as in a traditional parliamentary system. Therefore, the agreement changed the power-sharing formula that had favoured the Christians to a 50:50 ratio and enhanced the powers of the Sunni Prime Minister over those of the Christian president. Prior to the Taif negotiations, a Maronite Christian, General Michel Aoun, had been appointed Prime Minister by President Amine Gemayel on 22 September 1988. This had caused a serious political crisis of a split premiership, as the post was reserved for a Sunni Muslim due to the National Pact of 1943, and Omar Karami held this office. The Taif agreement helped to overcome this crisis by preparing the election of a new president. The agreement also provided for the disarmament of all national and non national militias. Hezbollah was allowed to stay armed in its capacity as a \\"resistance force\\" rather than a militia, fighting Israel in the south, a privilege obtained ‚Äì according to the Swedish academic Magnus Ranstorp ‚Äì in part by using its leverage as holder of a number of Western hostages.Ranstorp, Magnus, Hizb'allah in Lebanon: The Politics of the Western Hostage Crisis, New York, St. Martins Press, 1997, p. 105 Although the Taif Agreement identified the abolition of political sectarianism as a national priority, it provided no timeframe for doing so. The Chamber of Deputies was increased in size to 128 members, shared equally between Christians and Muslims, rather than elected by universal suffrage that would have provided a Muslim majority (excluding the expatriate community, a majority of which is Christian). A cabinet was established similarly divided equally between Christians and Muslims. According to As'ad AbuKhalil and many Lebanese Christians, the agreement greatly diminished the power of the President to the benefit of the Council of Ministers, although there is ongoing debate about whether this power has shifted to the Council as a whole or the Prime Minister. The president, having had significant executive power prior to the agreement, was reduced to a figurehead with no real and/or considerable power, as in most parliamentary republics. He also noted that the agreement extended the term of the Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament from one year to four years, although the position \\"remains largely without meaningful authority\\". The agreement was ratified on 5 November 1989. The Parliament met on the same day at the Kleyate air base in North Lebanon and elected President Ren√© Moawad, 409 days after Amine Gemayel vacated this position upon the expiration of his term in 1988. Moawad was unable to occupy the Presidential Palace which was still in use by General Michel Aoun. Moawad was assassinated seventeen days later in a car bombing in Beirut on 22 November 1989 as his motorcade returned from Lebanese Independence Day ceremonies. He was succeeded by Elias Hrawi, who remained in office until 1998.  Political reform  The agreement contained multiple constitutional amendments, which came into force following President Hrawi's signature in September 1990. Among the most major changes: * The ratio of Christians to Muslims in Parliament was reduced from 6:5 to 1:1. * The term duration of the Speaker of the House was increased from one year to four years. * Article 17 of the constitution was amended from \\"the executive power is vested in the President of the Republic, who exercises with the assistance of his ministers\\" to \\"the executive power is vested in the Council of Ministers, who exercise it according to the dispositions of this constitution\\". * Presidential prerogatives were somewhat curtailed. Among the powers lost were: ** Require parliamentary consultations before nominating the Prime Minister. ** Cannot dismiss or appoint individual ministers at will (requires approval of the Council). ** Introduce laws in Parliament. Instead, he introduces them to the Cabinet, who then vote to transmit it to Parliament. ** Nominate or dismiss state employees, which became the Council's duty. In reality, this had little impact in political life as civil servants were generally nominated by ministers and then voted on in cabinet, before being appointed by the President.  Disarmament of militias  Hrawi‚Äôs government set 30 April 1991 as the final date imposing the surrender of all territory, heavy artillery, and disbandment of militias.  Jbeil-Keserwan  The LF had already agreed to hand over the Keserwan and Jbeil districts in April 1990 to the LAF under General Elie Hayek (Mount Lebanon commander), with the condition that its 10,000 men strong force remain intact.  Metn-Baabda  The Metn and Baabda areas, which had been the heartland of the Phalange Party and the LF since the 1950s, experienced unprecedented fighting and shelling follow Michel Aoun‚Äôs rebellion against Syria then the LF in 1989/90. On the 13th October 1990, following a joint LF/Army/Syrian assault on Baabda Palace, Aoun escaped to the French embassy. In the next hours, the LAF under Hayek began moving South from Keserwan and East from Beirut into the Metn and Baabda. In the interim period between Aoun‚Äôs escape and the LAF arriving, the Syrian army committed multiple war crimes including the execution at point blank range of prisoners, in addition to stealing classified Lebanese army secrets and other classified government documents that Aoun had abandoned at Baabda.  East/West Beirut  Following the end of the Elimination War on the 13 October 1990, LAF soldiers began dismantling militia positions on the Green Line. Soon after, barrages and checkpoints blocking access between the cantons were dismantled, allowing traffic to move freely between the East and West for the first since 1976. In addition, the LAF moved into Martyrs‚Äô Square, which had been the site of some of the most intense fighting in the entire Civil War. A few years, the company Solidere would be mandated by the government to rebuild the completely destroyed downtown.  Aley-Chouf  The LAF had not been present in the Chouf and most parts of Aley since 1975 when fighting first broke out; in addition, the area was devoid of Christians following an ethnic cleansing committed by Jumblatt‚Äôs PLA during the 1983 Mountain War. On the 30 April 1991, the final date of militia disbandment, the Lebanese Army under the command of Hayek entered the Aley and Chouf districts, taking position at former PLA checkpoints and seizing all artillery material. The Chouf Mountains were the last areas of Mount Lebanon that the LAF moved into. Slowly after, Christians began returning to their homeland in these territories, but it was not until the Mountain Reconciliation in 2001 that the mass return of Christians was finalized.  North (LF-held)  Up until the 30 April 1991, all LF apparatus and positions were integrated into the national army. The army entered the districts of Bcharre (LF/Maronite heartland) to take command of any remaining positions, although there was no animosity or historic entrance as two presidents during the war (Bachir and Amine Gemayel) had been Phalangists, therefore army/LF cooperation had been an everyday affair.  North (Syrian-held)  All Syrian troops withdrew from Akkar and Tripoli in the two years following Hrawi's signature of the Accord to Tartous governorate in Syria or the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon (as there was no time limit on their presence in the Beqaa).  South  As the South was occupied by Israel and the South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia, the army was not deployed there until the year 2000, when Israel and the SLA retreated South of the Blue Line. As a result of the occupation in 1989, the Taif Agreement enabled \\"resistance\\" groups to remain armed in the South until Israeli withdrawal (principally Hezbollah). The LAF entered the South in 2000 for the first time since 1976 - 34 years after it retreated following the Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon. Despite the IDF withdrawal in 2000, Hezbollah did not disarm - with approval from President Lahoud and Syria - in violation of the Taif Accord.  Beqaa Valley  The agreement stipulated the withdrawal of all Syrian troops to the Beqaa valley by 2 years at most, but did not provide a time frame for their full withdrawal of the country. This loophole enabled the Syrian Arab Army to occupy the Beqaa for the next 15 years and dominate political life for the same period, until its complete retreat in March 2005 following the Cedar Revolution and UN Resolution 1559.

It serves the town of Somerville, and opened on 10 September 1889.Somerville Vicsig History The station was opened due to rapid growth in the fruit (apples and pears) and dairy industries. The dairy industry needed a quick way of sending milk and cream to butter factories. When the railway line reached Somerville, the station was a mile or so from the school and hall, which at the time was located on Lower Somerville Road. The town centre moved from there to its current site. Somerville station also operated as a post and telegraph office in the early years, and was a centre where people met as they collected their mail. The investment in special railway sidings, servicing new packing sheds and cool stores, over a period of six years from 1914 to 1920, created expansion in the apple and pear growing industry. The advent of iced T wagons made it possible to load chilled fruit for quick transport to Melbourne docks, and load directly into refrigerated ships for overseas destinations. Up until the end of World War II, a special train ran to the horticultural show at Somerville, which was reputed to be one of the biggest of its kind in Australia. The railway line also helped the fruit tree nurseries, and family-operated companies, such as Brunnings, Shepherds, Unthanks, Coles and Grants. They sent hundreds of thousands of bare-rooted trees all over Australia, to the Goulburn Valley, the Murray Valley, and Sunraysia areas in Victoria, the Riverina districts of New South Wales, and to the Granite Belt area, centred on Stanthorpe, in Queensland. This traffic was seasonal, and took place from May to September. The station building that stood on the platform at Somerville was portable, meaning that it was delivered in sections and bolted together. The building contained an office and a safe working area, from which the staff and ticket system was operated. There was a van shed for small goods and parcels, two waiting rooms, one for the ladies and a general waiting room, and toilets. This building existed until February 1986, when it was replaced with the current aluminium building. In the station yard, there was a general goods shed, a loading ramp, a crane, and a livestock loading facility. Later, two sidings were built for the Somerville Co-operative Cool Stores. The station master's house was located at the Frankston-Flinders Road entrance to the station. Unfortunately, two Somerville youths set fire to the house during August 2009. The house was completely destroyed, and the youths were apprehended. The station was usually staffed by the station master, but on occasions over the years, he was assisted by a lad porter or assistant station master from Baxter. Somerville station was the banking station for all stations to Stony Point, and supplied some of them with stores and stationery. Safeworking was originally the staff and ticketing system, but this was varied from time to time, until the opening of the Long Island sidings, when the electric staff system was introduced.

Biography  Enomiya-Lassalle joined the Society of Jesus on 25 April 1919. At the end of the usual Jesuit spiritual and academic training he was ordained priest on 28 August 1927. He travelled to Japan as a missionary in 1929 and became interested in that country's Buddhist practices. In 1940, he became the vicar of Hiroshima, and on 6 August 1945 he was critically wounded by the nuclear blast in that city, which is depicted in John Hersey's book Hiroshima.John Hersey: Hiroshima; Vintage Books, New York 1989, p 11 etc Shortly thereafter, he returned to Germany. In September 1946, he had an audience with Pope Pius XII, in which he revealed his plan to build in Hiroshima a cathedral dedicated to the idea of world peace.

In 1958, he published Zen: A Way to Enlightenment. Following Harada's death in 1961, Enomiya-Lassalle became an apprentice of one of Harada's students, Yamada Koun. Yamada was enthusiastic about the possibilities of Zen as a Christian practice, believing that \\"Zen would become an important stream in the Catholic Church one day\\".Terebess Asia Online With Enomiya-Lassalle's active assistance, he attracted a number of Catholic priests and nuns as students. In the late 1960s, Enomiya-Lasalle was certified as a teacher in Yamada's Sanbo Kyodan sect and given the title roshi (Zen master), while professing his continued belief in Christianity. After 1968, Enomiya-Lassalle spent much of his time in Europe leading Zen retreats and encouraging Zen practice among Christians.

Types   Talking drum  While this type of hourglass-shaped instrument can be modulated quite closely, its range is limited to a gathering or market-place, and it is primarily used in ceremonial settings. Ceremonial functions could include dance, rituals, story-telling and communication of points of order. Some of the groups of variations of the talking drum among West African ethnic groups: *Tama (Wolof of Senegal) *Gan gan, Dun Dun (Yoruba of Nigeria and eastern Benin) *Dondo (Akan of central Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire) *Lunna (Dagomba of northern Ghana; Mossi of Burkina Faso) *Kalangu (Hausa of northern Nigeria, Niger, northern Ghana, Benin and Cameroon) *Doodo (Songhai and Zarma of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger) In the 20th century the talking drums have become a part of popular music in West Africa, especially in the music genres of J√πj√∫ (Nigeria) and Mbalax (Senegal).  Slit gongs  Message drums, or more properly slit gongs, with hollow chambers and long, narrow openings that resonate when struck, are larger all-wood instruments hollowed out from a single log. Slit-log drums are common in the drum communication systems of Papua New Guinea, where they are known in Tok Pisin as garamut. Variations in the thickness of the walls would vary the tones when struck by heavy wooden drum sticks. While some were simple utilitarian pieces they could also be highly elaborate works of sculpture while still retaining their function. Often there are small stands under each end of the drum to keep it off of the ground and let it vibrate more freely. These drums were made out of hollowed logs. The bigger the log, the louder sound would be made and thus the farther it could be heard. A long slit would be cut in one side of the tree trunk. Next, the log would be hollowed out through the slit, leaving lips (wooden ledges) on each side of the opening. A drum could be tuned to produce a lower note and a higher note. For that it would need to be hollowed out more under one lip than under the other. The drum's lips are hit with sticks, beating out rhythms of high and low notes. Under ideal conditions, the sound can be understood at 3 to 7 miles, but interesting messages usually get relayed on by the next village. \\"The talking drums\\" or \\"jungle drums\\" is also a euphemism for gossip ‚Äì similar to \\"the grapevine\\".  Cambarysu  The Catuquinaru tribe of Brazil reportedly used a drum called the cambarysu to send vibrations through the ground to other cambarysus up to 1.5 km away.Prometheus: Illustrierte Wochenschrift √ºber die Fortschritte, volume 20 (1908)Enrico Hillyer Giglioli, Il \\"Cambarys√∫\\": telefono dei Catuquinar√∫ dell'Amazzonia (1898)The original of the telephone, Mataura Ensign, issue 520, 13 December 1898, page 4] Some scholars expressed skepticism that the device existed, and that it sent vibrations through the ground rather than the air. Drum languages In Africa, New Guinea and the tropical America, people have used drum telegraphy to communicate with each other from far away for centuries. When European expeditions came into the jungles to explore the local forest, they were surprised to find that the message of their coming and their intention was carried through the woods a step in advance of their arrival. An African message can be transmitted at the speed of 100 miles in an hour. Among the famous communication drums are the drums of West Africa (see talking drum). From regions known today as Nigeria and Ghana they spread across West Africa and to America and the Caribbean during the slave trade. There they were banned because they were being used by the slaves to communicate over long distances in a code unknown to their enslavers. Talking drums were also used in East Africa and are described by Andreus Bauer in the 'Street of Caravans' while acting as security guard in the Wissmann Truppe for the caravan of Charles Stokes. The traditional drumming found in Africa is actually of three different types. Firstly, a rhythm can represent an idea (or signal); secondly it can repeat the accentual profile of a spoken utterance; or thirdly it can simply be subject to musical laws. Drum communication methods are not languages in their own right; they are based on actual natural languages. The sounds produced are conventionalized or idiomatic signals based on speech patterns. The messages are normally very stereotyped and context- dependent. They lack the ability to form new combinations and expressions. In Central and East Africa, drum patterns represent the stresses, syllable lengths and tone of the particular African language. In tone languages, where syllables are associated with a certain tone, some words are distinguished only by their suprasegmental profile. Therefore, syllable drum languages can often transfer a message using the tonal phonemes alone. In certain languages, the pitch of each syllable is uniquely determined in relation to each adjacent syllable. In these cases, messages can be transmitted as rapid beats at the same speed as speech as the rhythm and melody both match the equivalent spoken utterance. Misinterpretations can occur due to the highly ambiguous nature of the communication. This is reduced by context effects and the use of stock phrases. For example, in Jabo, most stems are monosyllabic. By using a proverb or honorary title to create expanded versions of an animal, person's name or object, the corresponding single beat can be replaced with a rhythmic and melodic motif representing the subject. In practice not all listeners understand all of the stock phrases; the drum language is understood only to the level of their immediate concern.

State Road 120 (SR 120) is a state road in the north-eastern section of the state of Indiana. Running for about in a general east‚Äìwest direction, connecting rural portions of Elkhart, Lagrange and Steuben counties. The western terminus is a junction with Jackson Boulevard and Middleton Run Road in Elkhart. The eastern terminus is at the Indiana‚ÄìMichigan border, east of Fremont. The modern route of SR 120 was originally just small part of a much longer Native American trail. In the early 1920s a project to construct a road replacing the Native American trail took place. SR 120 was introduced in 1937 routed along its current routing, as a state road number for Vistula Road, which was falling apart. The western end of SR 120 has been moved a couple of different times within the city of Elkhart. Route description SR 120 begins in Elkhart at the intersection of Middleton Run Road and Jackson Boulevard. It follows Jackson Boulevard, northeasterly paralleling the St. Joseph River and the Grand Elk Railroad. The road leaves the city of Elkhart and enters Elkhart County before entering the town of Bristol. In Bristol the road runs along Vistula Street and has a short concurrency with SR 15. As SR 120 leaves Bristol it crosses over the Grand Elk Railroad. East of Bristol SR 120 curves and becomes an east-west roadway, passing through rural Elkhart and Lagrange Counties, having intersections with SR 13 and SR 5. In Lagrange county the road enters the town of Howe, passing through an intersection with SR 9. After the SR 9 intersection SR 120 is concurrent with Defiance Street, until SR 120 turns south onto 3rd Street, before turning east again on Wayne Street. East of Howe SR 120 passes through rural Lagrange and Steuben Counties, passing north of Ontario and through an intersection with the northern end of SR 3. SR 120 enters the town of Orland on Toledo Street, before having a four-way stop with SR 327. After SR 327, SR 120 leaves Orland heading northeasterly before turning easterly again, closely paralleling the Indiana Toll Road. SR 120 passes through an intersection with the northern end of SR 127, before crossing over Interstate 69. After Interstate 69, SR 120 has an entrance to the Indiana Toll Road and then passes under the toll road. SR 120 enters the town of Fremont, running along Toledo Street, having an all-way stop with the northern end of SR 827 (Wayne Street). After Fremont SR 120 passes near Clear Lake, as the road turns towards the southeast. Before the Indiana-Michigan state line SR 120 has an intersection with the former northern end of SR 1. At the Indiana-Michigan border SR 120 becomes Territorial Road, a county road in Hillsdale County, Michigan; this roadway was formerly M-120 which connected to OH-120. History The first path along part of the modern SR 120 roadway was the Vistula Trail, an old Native American trail, between Fort Duquesne and Green Bay via South Bend and the south shore of Lake Michigan. In 1922 Vistula Road was built at a cost of $87,500, . During 1930 SR 19 was proposed and accepted as a state road along modern SR 120 from Elkhart to Bristol. The second state road proposed along modern SR 120 was SR 827 from Fremont east to the Michigan/Indiana border in 1934. The right-of-way for SR 827, east of Fremont, was purchased in 1935. The following year Steuben County was having trouble maintaining the roadway, with bridges needing replacement and the gravel road surface was deteriorating. The state highway commission accepted Vistula Road as a state road in 1937 and it becomes part of SR 120. In late 1938 or early 1939 two parts of SR 120 opens to traffic with the first being between SR 13 and SR 3 and the second being throughout Steuben County. By 1941 SR 120 went between Elkhart and the Michigan state line, east of Fremont, uninterrupted. The entire roadway was paved by 1965. In late 1969 or early 1970 SR 120s western end was moved from an intersection between Middleton Run Road and US 20 (now Old US 20/Toledo Road) to an intersection between Goshen Avenue and Jackson Boulevard. The western end of SR 120 was moved once again to an intersection between Jackson Boulevard and Middleton Run Road on September 9, 2000. At one time, State Road 120 was to have been rerouted onto Elkhart County Road 17 to end at U.S. 20.

She is the daughter of fellow musicians, Diane and Bill Chambers, and the younger sister of musician and producer, Nash Chambers. All four were members of a family country music group, Dead Ringer Band, from 1992 to 1998, with Chambers starting her solo career thereafter. Five of her twelve studio albums have reached No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart, Barricades & Brickwalls (September 2001), Wayward Angel (May 2004), Carnival (August 2006) Rattlin' Bones (with her then-husband, Shane Nicholson) (April 2008) and Dragonfly (January 2017). In November 2018 she was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame and has won an additional fourteen ARIA Music Awards with nine for Best Country Album. Her autobiography, A Little Bird Told Me..., which was co-authored with music journalist, Jeff Apter, was released in 2011.  Dead Ringer Band  Kasey Chambers was born in 1976 in Mount Gambier, South Australia to Diane and Bill Chambers. Her older brother, Nash Chambers was born in 1974. From July 1976 the Chambers family travelled around the Nullarbor Plain, where the parents hunted foxes and rabbits for pelts during seven or eight months a year, spanning nine years. During the \\"hot months\\" (generally from November to March) they returned to Southend, South Australia, where her family owned a fish and chip shop for a time. From 1986 Bill and Diane returned to performing as a country music duo, while their children attended school in Southend. In the following year their parents added first Chambers and then Nash to their act, which became the Dead Ringer Band ‚Äì named for the children looking like their parents. Chambers was recorded on vocals for two albums released under Bill's name, Sea Eagle (1987) and Kindred Spirit (1991). From 1992 Dead Ringer Band released an extended play and four albums. For their first album, Red Desert Sky (November 1993), she was named as Kasey Jo Chambers, provided vocals and wrote four of its tracks. It was co-produced by the group with Eddie Sikorski at John Reynolds Recording Studio, Adelaide. Chambers met fellow country singer-songwriter, Beccy Cole, in mid-1989 in Adelaide ‚Äì Cole later joined Dead Ringer Band on a tour through New South Wales before going solo. Chambers later recalled, \\"I never really met anyone at this point in my life that was of the same generation as me ‚Äì a young girl who liked country music. And funnily enough the first song that I ever wrote in my life was called 'Beccy', about Beccy. It's the worst song you've ever heard in your whole life.\\" She cited Emmylou Harris as one of her primary influences, recalling that Harris' music was frequently played by her parents, ever since she was a child. The group ended as Chambers' parents divorced in the late 1990s, with Diane moving to Norfolk Island and Bill to Sydney.  1998‚Äì2002: The Captain to Barricades & Brickwalls  Chambers recorded her debut solo album, The Captain, on Norfolk Island during July and August 1998 with her brother Nash producing and father Bill on guitar. United States country musicians, Buddy and Julie Miller added guitars and vocals to four tracks. The Captain was released in May 1999 via EMI Music Australia and in June 2000 in the US by Asylum Records. It peaked at No. 11 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No. 1 on the related ARIA Country Albums chart. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999 she won Best Country Album and in the following year she won Best Female Artist for its title track, which was issued in 2000. The Captain was certified double platinum for shipment of 140,000 copies by Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) in 2001. It reached the top 50 of the Billboard Top Country Albums in 2001. She toured the US as a support act to Lucinda Williams and later supported Emmylou Harris on the Australian leg of that artist's tour. \\"The Captain\\", was played in episode 8 (\\"He Is Risen\\") of the third season of The Sopranos, in April 2001. Chambers' second studio album, Barricades & Brickwalls, was released in September 2001 via EMI Music, which was also produced by Nash. It debuted at No. 4 in the ARIA Albums Chart and peaked at No. 1 in February of the following year. Its third single, \\"Not Pretty Enough\\" (January 2002), also peaked at No. 1 on the related ARIA Singles Chart in the same month. The track was written by Chambers and according to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, \\"[it's] about being ignored by commercial radio.\\" He cited her autobiography, A Little Bird Told Me (2011), \\"'I wrote [it] as a song about feeling invisible... it was obvious that out in the music industry there was only one path for most young women ‚Äì over-sexualised and over made up. To succeed you needed to look like Britney or Shakira.\\" She is the first Australian country music artist to have simultaneous No. 1 single and album. Subsequent singles \\"Million Tears\\" (June 2002) and \\"If I Were You\\" (October) also made the top 40. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2002 she won three categories, Album of the Year, Best Female Artist and Best Country Album, for Barricades & Brickwalls. It was certified seven times platinum in 2003 for shipment of at least 490,000 copies. In February 2002 it was released in the US, which peaked at No. 104 on the Billboard 200, topping the related Heatseeker Chart and reaching the top 20 of their country music chart. It received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to aggregate site, Metacritic, with a rating of 74% from 12 critics. Australian music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, compared it to her first album, \\"The musical cast remains essentially the same as The Captain with the addition of a 'rock' component via drummer Peter Luscombe and rhythm guitarist Dave Steel, and a guest appearance from 'punkabilly' band the Living End. The album also features appearances from Paul Kelly and American country's Lucinda Williams.\\" Nimmervoll cited Chambers' observation, \\"The last album showed my life story. That was Introducing Kasey Chambers. This one's The Many Moods of Kasey Chambers.\\"  2003‚Äì07: Wayward Angel to Carnival  Chambers recorded a cover version of Cyndi Lauper's \\"True Colours\\" (April 2003), which peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It was used as the theme song for the Rugby World Cup in that year. Her rendition reached No. 76 on the End of Year Top 100 Singles for 2003, and was certified as a gold record for shipment of 35,000. At the APRA Music Awards of 2003 Chambers won three categories with \\"Not Pretty Enough\\" named as Song of the Year, Most Performed Australian Work and Most Performed Country Work. alt=She is shown in upper body shot and left profile. She has her eyes closed as she sings into a microphone and plays her guitar. She released her third solo album, Wayward Angel, in May 2004, which debuted at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart and remained at the top position for five weeks. It was accredited triple platinum for shipment of 210,000 copies by the end of the following year. AllMusic's Mark Deming felt, \\"[it] is perhaps a bit less striking than her first two sets, The Captain and Barricades & Brickwalls, if only because she staked out her style on those sessions, and here she's harvesting from the ground she broke earlier on. But this also sounds like her most accomplished effort to date.\\" Singles from the album include \\"Hollywood\\" (August 2004), \\"Pony\\" (January 2005) and \\"Saturated\\" (May). Following the Boxing Day Tsunami (26 December 2004), Chambers appeared at the Wave Aid charity concert in Sydney in January 2005, to help raise funds for organisations in disaster affected areas. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004 she won both Best Female Artist and Best Country Album for Wayward Angel. Chambers's fourth studio album, Carnival (August 2006), also debuted at No. 1. Deming found, \\"[it] is roots-friendly enough that it isn't likely to seriously alienate most of her fans, this album does represent a clear and decisive break from the country-influenced approach of her earlier music; most of these 12 songs are easygoing but satisfying roots rock with a bluesy undertone... As a songwriter, she keeps getting better at writing about the stuff of everyday lives (love, lust, disappointment, getting on with life) with an uncommon degree of horse sense and attention to detail, and if anything, the new musical backdrops have added to the depth of her emotional landscapes.\\" Its lead single, \\"Nothing at All\\" (July), reached the top ten.  2008‚Äì10: Rattlin' Bones to Little Bird  alt=The 32-year-old Chambers wears a white dress with bare shoulders. She has numerous brown necklaces and a silver one. She has a chin stud below her lower lip and is looking to her right with a smile as she speaks. In April 2008 Chambers issued her first collaboration album, Rattlin' Bones, with her then-husband, Shane Nicholson, which was co- produced by Nash and Nicholson. It debuted at No. 1 and was certified platinum for 70,000 shipments by the end of that year. Frank Gutch Jnr of No Depression felt, \\"[it] could be the soundtrack of the Old West, or themes from the old mountain lifestyle. They have it down, from the sparing use of mandolin and the at times Everly Brothers harmonies to the dirt-beneath-the-fingernails aura. This music is American. Except that it's Australian. It's a conundrum.\\" Chambers and Nicholson were joined by fellow country musician, Troy Cassar- Daley, to perform at Sound Relief, in March 2009, which was a benefit concert in support of survivors of the February 2009 Victorian bushfires. It was held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, simultaneously with another concert at the Sydney Cricket Ground. All the proceeds from the Melbourne concert went to the Red Cross Victorian Bushfire relief. Appearing with Chambers in Melbourne were, Augie March, Bliss N Eso with Paris Wells, Gabriella Cilmi, Hunters & Collectors, Jack Johnson, Jet, Kings of Leon, Liam Finn, Midnight Oil, Paul Kelly, Split Enz and Wolfmother. During 2009 Chambers collaborated with Bill, Nash and family members to release a children's music album, Kasey Chambers, Poppa Bill and the Little Hillbillies (November 2009). In 2010 it won the Australian Independent Record (AIR) Award for Best Independent Country Album. As part of that project she also co-wrote a children's story, Little Kasey Chambers and the Lost Music (2009), with Bernadette Werchon. The artist's seventh studio album, Little Bird, appeared in September 2010 via Liberation Music, which peaked at No. 3. Slant Magazines Jonathan Keefe rated it as four- out-of-five stars and explained, \\"[it] is a polished, studio-slick record of pop-country whose songs are catchy as all hell... It's the economy of [her] songwriting that has been the source of the comparisons between her work and that of [Lucinda] Williams, and Chambers's deep understanding of song structure allows her to create real emotional complexity from just a few turns of phrase.\\" It won Best Country Album at the ARIA Awards in 2011.  2011‚Äì13: Storybook to Wreck & Ruin  APRA Awards, Sydney, May 2012 Storybook, Chambers next studio album, was released in September 2011 and consists of cover versions of other artists material, which peaked at No. 21. No Surf Musics Jason D Hamad described how, \\"because of its very nature I can't say that this album breaks any new ground. Still, it does justice to Chambers' sometimes-eclectic influences and adds an additional layer of understanding for her fans.\\" Her single from the album, \\"Luka\\" (2011), is a rendition of Susan Vega's original from 1987. Hamad discussed how, \\"[she] strips away the 80‚Äôs synth-pop, replacing it with more traditional instrumentation including a prominent, bouncing bass, but keeps the airy musical feel meant to contrast with the dark tone of the lyrics.\\" Her autobiography, A Little Bird Told Me..., was co-authored with music journalist, Jeff Apter, and was issued later that year. Her second collaboration with Nicholson, Wreck & Ruin (September 2012), reached No. 6 and provided another ARIA Award for Best Country Album in the next year. Keefe found the album has, \\"the married couple layering intricate vocal harmonies over some casual, mostly acoustic country-rock... Though [it] impresses for its thematic focus and gallows humor, the economy of language in the songwriting occasionally scans as a bit pedestrian.\\" On 23 April 2013, it was announced that Nicholson and Kasey Chambers had separated, with the collision of work and family life said to have forced their split.  2014‚Äì2018: Bittersweet to Campfire  Chambers' tenth studio album, Bittersweet, appeared in August 2014, which peaked at No. 2. It was produced by Nick DiDia ‚Äì her first album which was not produced by her brother, Nash. Deming felt, \\"[she] has written a set of songs that are unpretentiously intelligent but deal with matters of the heart and soul with unrelenting honesty, and her rough, sweet vocals never deliver anything short of the ring of truth. [It] is a strong, satisfying album from one of the best and most distinctive singer/songwriters of her day, and this confirms she can move in any number of different directions and still offer her listeners something remarkable.\\" It was also recorded after her marital split from Nicholson in previous year. The Musics Chris Familton observed, \\"It finds her canvassing a range of styles and moods, often with religious/biblical references, without sacrificing her heart-on-sleeve emotiveness, innate sense of melody and country heart.\\" The title track is a duet with Bernard Fanning (ex- Powderfinger), which Familton found, \\"sways with a Neil Young looseness that works surprisingly well.\\" It won Best Country Album at the ARIA Music Awards of 2014. In late 2015 she covered the track, \\"Cold and Bitter Tears\\", on a tribute album for US soul blues musician, Ted Hawkins, Cold and Bitter Tears: The Songs of Ted Hawkins, which was released on Eight 30 Records in Austin, Texas. She was joined on the track by Bill and explained, \\"My dad called me up one day and told me about the project... We recorded it at my dad's house, sitting around jamming around a mike. It was a really special thing. I play with my dad all the time, but the novelty never wears off. I love the combination that we create together.\\" Dragonfly, her eleventh studio album appeared in January 2017 and reached No. 1. It is a double album with Nash producing one session at his Foggy Mountain studio and Australian singer- songwriter, Paul Kelly, producing another session at Sing Sing Studios, Melbourne. She followed with a US tour in mid-year. Besides duetting on a track with Kelly, she also sings on a track each with Ed Sheeran, Keith Urban and Foy Vance. Rolling Stone Australia's Gareth Hipwell observed, \\"[she] has always tended to eschew the more reticent course of songwriting from a point of abstraction, consistently wearing her profoundest truths and uncertainties on her sleeve. It's an artistic penchant given full flight on free-ranging double-LP Dragonfly: 'Talkin' Baby Blues', a shot of Woody Guthriesque spoken- word acoustica, is itself a stunningly candid retelling of Chambers' storied life to date.\\" Jonathan Bernstein of American Songwriter rated it at three- and-a-half stars out-of five and explained, \\"[it] serves as a summation of sorts of the singer's entire career, a comprehensive, double-album opus that effortlessly switches between Appalachian mountain music, slow-burning folk- rock, melodic radio-pop, Woody Guthrie talking blues, and celebratory country- gospel.\\" At the ARIA Music Awards of 2017 she won her eighth Best Country Album trophy, for Dragonfly. Chambers twelfth studio album, Campfire (April 2018), is a collaboration with the Fireside Disciples, an \\"ad hoc acoustic ensemble\\", comprising Bill on dobro, Brandon Dodd on acoustic guitar and Alan Pigram on mandolin (and vocals on the album's lead track). It peaked at No. 6 and was co-produced by Chambers, Bill, Dodd, Pigram and Jordan Power. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2018 Chambers became the youngest solo female artist to be inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame, as well as winning the Best Country Album category for a record ninth time. At the Australian Country Music Awards of 2019, Campfire won Traditional Country Album of the Year. Personal life From 2000 Kasey Chambers' domestic partner was Cori Hopper, a Perth-born actor, film and music video maker, later based in Sydney. The couple have a son, Talon (born 2002); they separated in November 2004. Hopper was a presenter on Australia's Funniest Home Videos from January to December of that year and was a regular cast member on The Wedge during 2006. On 17 December 2005, Chambers married fellow country music singer-songwriter, Shane Nicholson. Chambers had sung a duet, \\"Designed to Fade\\", with Nicholson on his debut solo album, It's a Movie (2002), which was produced by Nash Chambers. Subsequently, they co-released two albums, Rattlin' Bones (2008) and Wreck & Ruin (2012). Chambers and Nicholson have two children: son Arlo Ray (2007) and daughter Poet Poppin (2011). In April 2013 the couple announced their separation. Chambers and Shane Nicholson, at the ARIA Hall of Fame, July 2008 At the age of 30 Chambers was diagnosed with an eating disorder, a combination of bulimia and anorexia nervosa. She explained, \\"I just didn't feel myself and I knew that something wasn't right [...] It wasn't an image thing for me ... It wasn't 'Oh I look fat in photos'. It was more about the control thing.\\" She was treated by a psychologist and MammaMias Jessie Stephens, observed, \\"she recognises the importance of accepting that it might be a bad day, or a bad week, and negativity is a vital part of living a balanced life. Pushing it away can lead to anxieties manifesting in a different, more debilitating way.\\" In her autobiography, A Little Bird Told Me... (2011), Chambers provided, \\"a disarmingly honest account of a remarkable talent.\\" The Herald Suns Corinna Hente observed, \\"Despite all the success, tragedy struck through a miscarriage, a broken relationship, anorexia and a breakdown. She rebuilt her life with music, playing covers with her family in a band called the Lost Dogs at the local pub.\\" She described one of their gigs from July 2007, \\"it's not the best idea to get up and sing with a band when you're nine months pregnant, 10 days overdue and bigger than a barn, but there was something about my gigs with the Lost Dogs band that I found impossible to resist. They were a reminder of why I'd fallen in love with music in the first place.\\" Chambers was raised as a Seventh-day Adventist; by 2002 she was no longer aligned with the church. After releasing her single, \\"Is God Real?\\" (April 2015), she described her beliefs, \\"It is a very personal thing, which is probably why we don't talk about it, but I don't think that means we shouldn't... For me, I certainly believe in a higher power. I don't have a yes or no answer. I have some sort of belief there, but it has changed a lot over the years.\\" As of November 2018 she lives in Copacabana, New South Wales Central Coast.

Jovibarba have pale- greenish-yellow or yellow actinomorphic flowers with about six petals, while Sempervivum have generally pinkish flowers with around twice as many petals, which open more widely than jovibarba flowers. The common name hen and chicks is applied to some Jovibarba species (and also species in several other genera). Most jovibarbas, like sempervivums, reproduce via offsets in addition to producing seeds via sexual reproduction. Jovibarba heuffelii does not produce offsets on stolons. Instead the offspring of this plant are produced within the mother plant. To propagate it must be split with a knife. The other two jovibarba species are commonly called rollers. They produce offsets that are lightly attached and easily pop off and roll away from the mother plant. Offsets survive the main rosette, which is monocarpic.

It serves the western Melbourne suburb of Ardeer.Ardeer Vicsig The station will eventually become part of the metropolitan network under the Western Rail Plan, announced by the Andrews government in 2018. History In 1903, the Australian Explosives and Chemical Company Siding opened near what would become the site of Ardeer station. The siding faced Melbourne and was on the north side of the line. In 1910, a connection to the siding was added at the Melbourne end, converting it into a loop, and it was renamed the Federal Manure Siding. In 1929, it was renamed again as Nobel (Aust) Pty Ltd Chemical Siding. In April 1929, Ardeer station was opened at the same time as a passenger service for factory workers at Ardeer and Deer Park was introduced. The loop siding was to the east of the Fitzgerald Road level crossing, and the platform was to the west of it, on the north side of the line. In 1934, it was renamed Ardeer Siding, and in August 1956, the station was closed and the passenger platform removed. In 1976, the line through the section was duplicated from Sunshine to Deer Park West Junction. The current Ardeer station was opened on 2 May 1977, with an island platform being provided at the up end of the existing siding, about 800 metres further east than the former station.

History The station opened as Kororoit on 2 April 1884, along with the Serviceton line, and was renamed Deer Park in 1899, by which time the station had a three road yard, passenger platform on the southern track, a goods platform on the northern track, and an interlocked signal box. Being on a single track railway, it served as a crossing loop for trains, which remained until 1913, when the signal box was abolished. In 1928, a siding serving Nobel Chemical Finishes (Aust) Pty Ltd was opened at the Up (Southern Cross) end of the station, running north to a loop siding and dead end. In 1929, alterations were made to the electric staff working of trains, to permit workers trains to operate to the Nobel factories at Ardeer and Deer Park. In 1943, the signal box was reopened, in conjunction with the opening of the new Ravenhall siding (Commonwealth Government Siding), at the Down end of the yard. The new siding ran south from the line to a loop siding, before terminating at a dead end. The Nobel siding (later ICIANZ) was closed in 1955, and in 1974, the line from Sunshine to Deer Park West Junction was duplicated, with the current island platform provided. The signal box was closed, and line was worked by Centralised Traffic Control from Sunshine. Crossovers between lines were provided at each end of the platform. The Ravenhall siding was abolished in 1978. Boom barriers were provided at the nearby Mount Derrimut Road level crossing in 1981. In 1987, one of the loop sidings in the yard was removed, with the last siding removed in 1989, leaving only the main line and platform.

History The station opened as Mount Atkinson on 2 April 1884, at the same time as the Serviceton line though it, and was renamed Rockbank in 1889. Being on a single track railway line, it provided a crossing loop for trains, and continues to do so today. By 1914, it had a three road yard, a passenger platform on the southern track, a goods platform on the northern track, and an interlocked signal box. The station served the local farming community. With a chaff mill established in the 1890s, and the recreation reserve and tennis club located nearby, the station became the focus of the Rockbank community. In 1960, the crossing loop was extended for longer trains of up to 730 metres, and a short platform was provided on the loop road. In 1976, centralised traffic control was provided on the line from Sunshine to Rockbank. By the 1970s, the mill was disused, and the station building was demolished circa 1985. In 1986, the yard was rationalised to main line and crossing loop, and in 1990, the mechanical signals and points were removed, and replaced by remotely controlled signalling, operated from the Bacchus Marsh signal box.

Such potential functions frequently occur in supersymmetric systems. The term \\"modulus\\" is borrowed from mathematics, where it is used synonymously with \\"parameter\\". The word moduli (Moduln in German) first appeared in 1857 in Bernhard Riemann's celebrated paper \\"Theorie der Abel'schen Functionen\\".Bernhard Riemann, Journal f√ºr die reine und angewandte Mathematik, vol. 54 (1857), pp. 101-155  Moduli spaces in quantum field theories  In quantum field theories, the possible vacua are usually labeled by the vacuum expectation values of scalar fields, as Lorentz invariance forces the vacuum expectation values of any higher spin fields to vanish. These vacuum expectation values can take any value for which the potential function is a minimum. Consequently, when the potential function has continuous families of global minima, the space of vacua for the quantum field theory is a manifold (or orbifold), usually called the vacuum manifold. This manifold is often called the moduli space of vacua, or just the moduli space, for short. The term moduli are also used in string theory to refer to various continuous parameters that label possible string backgrounds: the expectation value of the dilaton field, the parameters (e.g. the radius and complex structure) which govern the shape of the compactification manifold, et cetera. These parameters are represented, in the quantum field theory that approximates the string theory at low energies, by the vacuum expectation values of massless scalar fields, making contact with the usage described above. In string theory, the term \\"moduli space\\" is often used specifically to refer to the space of all possible string backgrounds. Moduli spaces of supersymmetric gauge theories In general quantum field theories, even if the classical potential energy is minimized over a large set of possible expectation values, generically once quantum corrections are included nearly all of these configurations cease to minimize the energy. The result is that the set of vacua of the quantum theory is generally much smaller than that of the classical theory. A notable exception occurs when the various vacua in question are related by a symmetry which guarantees that their energy levels remain exactly degenerate. The situation is very different in supersymmetric quantum field theories. In general, these possess large moduli spaces of vacua which are not related by any symmetry, for example, the masses of the various excitations may differ at various points on the moduli space. The moduli spaces of supersymmetric gauge theories are in general easier to calculate than those of nonsupersymmetric theories because supersymmetry restricts the allowed geometries of the moduli space even when quantum corrections are included. Allowed moduli spaces of 4-dimensional theories The more supersymmetry there is, the stronger the restriction on the vacuum manifold. Therefore, if a restriction appears below for a given number N of spinors of supercharges, then it also holds for all greater values of N. =N=1 Theories= The first restriction on the geometry of a moduli space was found in 1979 by Bruno Zumino and published in the article Supersymmetry and K√§hler Manifolds. He considered an N=1 theory in 4-dimensions with global supersymmetry. N=1 means that the fermionic components of the supersymmetry algebra can be assembled into a single Majorana supercharge. The only scalars in such a theory are the complex scalars of the chiral superfields. He found that the vacuum manifold of allowed vacuum expectation values for these scalars is not only complex but also a K√§hler manifold. If gravity is included in the theory, so that there is local supersymmetry, then the resulting theory is called a supergravity theory and the restriction on the geometry of the moduli space becomes stronger. The moduli space must not only be K√§hler, but also the K√§hler form must lift to integral cohomology. Such manifolds are called Hodge manifolds. The first example appeared in the 1979 article Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and Higgs Effect in Supergravity Without Cosmological Constant and the general statement appeared 3 years later in Quantization of Newton's Constant in Certain Supergravity Theories. =N=2 Theories= In extended 4-dimensional theories with N=2 supersymmetry, corresponding to a single Dirac spinor supercharge, the conditions are stronger. The N=2 supersymmetry algebra contains two representations with scalars, the vector multiplet which contains a complex scalar and the hypermultiplet which contains two complex scalars. The moduli space of the vector multiplets is called the Coulomb branch while that of the hypermultiplets is called the Higgs branch. The total moduli space is locally a product of these two branches, as nonrenormalization theorems imply that the metric of each is independent of the fields of the other multiplet.(See for example Argyres, Non-Perturbative Dynamics Of Four-Dimensional Supersymmetric Field Theories, pp. 6‚Äì7, for further discussion of the local product structure.) In the case of global N=2 supersymmetry, in other words in the absence of gravity, the Coulomb branch of the moduli space is a special K√§hler manifold. The first example of this restriction appeared in the 1984 article Potentials and Symmetries of General Gauged N=2 Supergravity: Yang-Mills Models by Bernard de Wit and Antoine Van Proeyen, while a general geometric description of the underlying geometry, called special geometry, was present by Andrew Strominger in his 1990 paper Special Geometry. The Higgs branch is a hyperk√§hler manifold as was shown by Luis Alvarez-Gaume and Daniel Freedman in their 1981 paper Geometrical Structure and Ultraviolet Finiteness in the Supersymmetric Sigma Model. Including gravity the supersymmetry becomes local. Then one needs to add the same Hodge condition to the special Kahler Coulomb branch as in the N=1 case. Jonathan Bagger and Edward Witten demonstrated in their 1982 paper Matter Couplings in N=2 Supergravity that in this case, the Higgs branch must be a quaternionic K√§hler manifold. =N>2 Supersymmetry= In extended supergravities with N>2 the moduli space must always be a symmetric space.

Among Meinong's pupils were Stephan Witasek, Vittorio Benussi, Rudolf Ameseder, Konrad Zindler, Wilhelm Maria Frankl, Eduard Martinak, Ernst Mally and Franz Weber.

Set in a fictional motel (hotel, in the revival) in the Midlands, Crossroads became a byword for cheap production values, particularly in the 1970s and early 1980s. Despite this, the series regularly attracted huge audiences during this time, with ratings as high as 15 million viewers. It was created by Hazel Adair and Peter Ling and produced by ATV (until the end of 1981) and then by ATV's successor, Central Independent Television until 1988. The series was revived by Carlton Television in 2001; however, due to low ratings it was cancelled again in 2003. Storylines 1964‚Äì1988 The original premise of Crossroads is based around two feuding sisters, Kitty Jarvis (Beryl Johnstone) and Meg Richardson (Noele Gordon). Meg is a wealthy woman who, with the help of her late husband Charles' insurance money, and compensation money from the council for them building a motorway through their land, turned her large Georgian house into a motel. \\"The Crossroads Motel\\" was located on the outskirts of the small village of King's Oak, which is on the outskirts of Birmingham. With Charles, Meg had two children. The elder was a girl named Jill (Jane Rossington) (born 1946) followed by Alexander, or \\"Sandy\\" (Roger Tonge), in 1950. Kitty, on the other hand, is married to the unemployed Dick (Brian Kent) and is not wealthy. Dick and Kitty purchased a newsagents and tobacconists shop in the nearby town of Heathbury a few years after the show started. Kitty and Dick had a son called Brian (David Fennell), born in 1945. The idea of the sisters feuding was soon dropped. The character of Kitty was written out in 1969 after the death of actress Johnstone. The show had several characters in its early years. They included Meg and Kitty's brother, Andy Fraser (Ian Patterson), who marries motel secretary Ruth Bailey (Pamela Greenhall) in 1965; hotel chef Carlos Raphael (Anthony Morton), his wife Josefina (Gillian Betts), waitress Marilyn Gates (Sue Nicholls and later Nadine Hanwell) and kitchen assistant Amy Turtle (Ann George), later briefly arrested as a suspected Soviet spy, joined the series in 1965, as did postmistress Edith Tatum (Elisabeth Croft) and motel handyman Philip Winter (Malcolm Young). Long running character Diane Lawton (Susan Hanson) arrived in 1966. Other additions included Meg's close friend, former actress Tish Hope (Joy Andrews); suave manager and later motel director David Hunter (Ronald Allen); his first wife Rosemary (Janet Hargreaves); their son Chris (Freddy Foote; Stephen Hoye); David's second wife Barbara (Sue Lloyd); chefs Gerald Lovejoy (William Avenell), Bernard Booth (David Lawton) and Shughie McFee (Angus Lennie); hairdresser Vera Downend (Zeph Gladstone); the Harvey family, consisting of father Wilf (Morris Parsons) and his grown children Stan (Edward Clayton; Terry Molloy) and Sheila (Sonia Fox); accountant and later motel manager Adam Chance (Tony Adams); and cleaner Doris Luke (Kathy Staff). Perhaps the most memorable character proved to be the \\"village idiot\\" Benny Hawkins (Paul Henry), whose trademark was a woolly hat worn all year round. His fans included British troops serving in the Falklands War in 1982, who nicknamed the Falkland Islanders \\"Bennies\\" after the character.New Statesman, Volume 105, page 15 Instructed to stop using the name, the troops came up with \\"Stills\\" for locals - because they were \\"still Bennies\\".The New Yorker, Volume 69, Issues 36-39, page 87 Over the years the series dealt with storylines which were controversial for the times. A single parent working at the motel was hugely controversial in the mid-1960s; and Sandy Richardson was injured in a car accident in 1974 and needed to use a wheelchair. The storyline was developed when actor Roger Tonge had himself become a wheelchair user off screen as a way to keep him in the series, thus becoming the first paraplegic regular character portrayed in a British soap opera. The series also saw black characters appearing regularly - a follow-on from the 1960s BBC soap Compact, also created by Hazel Adair and Peter Ling. Melanie Harper (Cleo Sylvestre) arrived at the motel in 1970 as Meg's foster daughter (itself a taboo issue). Sylvestre was given the role by producer Reg Watson after press coverage of racial tensions in the Birmingham area at that time.http://www.crossroadsnetwork.co.uk/society/cleosylvestre.htm . In 1978, garage mechanic Joe MacDonald (Carl Andrews) arrived. The year before, an interracial summer romance took place between Cockney garage mechanic Dennis Harper (Guy Ward) and motel receptionist Meena Chaudri (Karen David). 1981 saw a highly controversial storyline about a false accusation of rape; a 1983 storyline saw a test tube baby born to Glenda and Kevin Banks (Lynette McMorrough and David Moran). The subject of Down syndrome was also raised in 1983 with an insight into the life of Nina Weill, a little girl who, as Nina Paget, was befriended by three of the regular Crossroads characters. The character of Meg Mortimer was axed in 1981 and was thought to have died in a fire that gutted the motel, but turned up alive aboard the QE2, about to sail to a new life overseas. Newspapers reported that two endings were planned for Meg: she would either die in the fire, or disappear for a while and turn up on the QE2. Viewers were surprised to see producers had used both. Meg returns briefly in 1983 for a reunion with Jill and Adam on their honeymoon in Venice. In 1985, new producer Phillip Bowman was planning to bring the character of Meg Mortimer back into the show as a \\"permanent occasional.\\" Plans were well advanced and scripts were written when Noele Gordon died in April of that year, aged 65. Edward Clayton was brought back as Jill's ex-husband Stan Harvey to read the lines originally written for Gordon. In 1986, the new character Ray Grice played by Al Hunter Ashton was introduced as part of an attempt to create wider storylines. 2001‚Äì2003 With the revival in 2001, changes were made to characters and stories. Jill Chance had married John Maddingham (Jeremy Nicholas) and been widowed, but was calling herself Jill Harvey again, the name by which she had been known prior to her marriage to Adam Chance in 1983. In the revival, Jill Harvey owned thirty percent of the hotel, which was never explained as she had divested all her interest in the hotel in 1985 and the original series ended with her opting not to buy the hotel back with her estranged husband Adam Chance. The battle over Jill's shares formed the backbone of the storylines for the new series' early episodes. References were also made to the Russell family taking over a \\"failing motel\\", despite Crossroads having become a hotel in the late 1980s. In the final episode of the original series, the name 'King's Oak Country Hotel' was seen over the entrance doors. Lack of real links to the past, and the killing of Jill a few months into the new run, turned many fans away. Popular characters in the new Crossroads included new owner Kate Russell (Jane Gurnett), supercilious receptionist Virginia Raven (Sherrie Hewson), and womanising deputy manager Jake Booth (Colin Wells). The storyline of the final episode was the revelation that the revived series and glamorous hotel had been a dream of supermarket worker and Crossroads fan Angela, with all the other characters revealed as shoppers. Angela even approaches a female customer in the supermarket and tells her she recognises her as \\"Tracey Booth from Crossroads\\". Tracey's mother-in-law, Kate, was also shown as one of Angela's colleagues in the supermarket.

ATV era Crossroads title sequence (1969). Crossroads began its run on Monday 2 November 1964 and was first shown five days a week. The episodes were then recorded \\"as live\\", a very common practice at the time, with very limited opportunities for retakes. Within a few months, 10 of the ITV companies had started broadcasting the series, though Granada never screened it during the 1960s. The Independent Television Authority (ITA) decreed in 1967 that Crossroads should be reduced in frequency to four episodes per week to improve its quality.John Williams \\"Crossroads - The 1960s\\", BFI screenonline By which point the series was no longer networked and each ITV station broadcast the series on different days. The series was widely derided by critics who criticised the wobbly sets and fluffed lines, but gained many fans, most famously Prime Minister Harold Wilson's wife Mary who complained when the newly formed Thames Television (the franchisee for the London area), decided to stop showing the series in 1968. The decision proved unpopular with viewers and was reversed six months later, although initially it was placed in a late afternoon slot like few other ITV stationsAnthony Hayward Obituary: Peter Ling, The Independent, 27 September 2006 but, as a result of the gap in transmissions, viewers in the Thames region were about six months behind the rest of the country for several years. Crossroads was not fully broadcast to all ITV companies until 1972, when Granada, took it. (Each ITV station was able to broadcast the episodes at different times on the same day). Though by the early 1970s it was second only to Coronation Street in the ratingsJohn Williams \\"Crossroads (1964-88, 2001-03)\\", BFI screenonline it did, occasionally, in the mid-1970s beat Coronation Street gaining audiences of up to 15 million viewers during the decade.Anthony Hayward Obituary: Jack Barton, The Independent, 31 October 2002 In 1979, the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) - then commercial television's regulator - decided production should be reduced further to three episodes a week from April 1980, with the chairman of the IBA Lady Plowden reportedlyObituary: Lady Plowden, Daily Telegraph, 2 October 2000 describing the soap opera as \\"distressingly popular\\".\\"Dyke makes a difference\\", The Economist, 1 July 1999 ATV planned to replace the fourth episode with a spin-off series called A Family Affair,As detailed in a 1980 book of the same name. but this idea was dropped. Series star Noele Gordon, who played matriarch Meg Richardson, regularly won the TV Times Most Popular Female Personality viewers award during the 1970s.John Williams \\"Crossroads - The 1970s\\", BFI screenonline Viewers reacted negatively at the dismissal of Gordon in 1981, an action taken by head of programming Charles Denton who became a \\"national hate figure\\".Sue Summers \\"Hired to make drama out of a crisis\\", The Independent, 21 July 1993 The series producer Jack Barton agreed with Denton, thinking that Gordon's character had become too dominant, but the episode gained heavy coverage in the press for some time.Len Masterman Teaching the Media, Rouledge, 2005 [1985], p.197 Why Gordon was sacked remains a mystery to TV historians as she was the most popular character on the soap and no real reason was given other than that producers felt it was time for a change. The actress herself was terribly upset by the decision (she was the only cast member on a permanent contract and, had been led to believe that the meeting where she was told she was being dismissed was simply the annual negotiation for the next years contract). In numerous interviews at the time she made it clear that she did not want to go. Some people have speculated that Gordon's dominant attitude on the set and within the company had put a few executive backs up and they simply wanted shot of her. She was very passionate about the soap and would regularly defend it against the many critics. Others have believed that ITV found Crossroads an embarrassment and wanted to find a way of decreasing the viewing figures by sacking Gordon (the biggest audience draw) so that it could be used as justification to axe it. Whatever the reason the series never really recovered from her loss. Central era Crossroads Kings Oak title sequence (1987‚Äì88). ATV, having lost its ITV franchise at the end of 1981, was ordered by the IBA to reform into Central Independent Television, which took over the franchise on 1 January 1982, and was thought to show limited enthusiasm for the programmes it inherited.John Williams \\"Crossroads - The 1980s\\", BFI screenonline Further changes were introduced in March 1985, when new filming locations, sets and characters were introduced. Many storylines began to revolve around the new motel owner, Nicola Freeman (played by Gabrielle Drake). More long-term characters, such as David and Barbara Hunter, were axed. The theme tune was also updated, and the opening titles replaced with a longer version. Finally, the show was renamed Crossroads Motel - although this fact was never formally announced by the show's production team and the word \\"Motel\\" was simply incorporated into the opening titles. The closing titles, which had scrolled in multiple 'crossroad' directions since the earliest episodes, were replaced with conventional scrolling credits. In 1986, a new producer, William Smethurst, took over the series following the sacking of his predecessor, Philip Bowman. Smethurst, who had been brought in by Central Television's new head of drama, Ted Childs, ordered changes, aimed at creating a wittier, more upmarket serial, and at improving the production values of the show. Smethurst shifted the narrative centre to the nearby village of King's Oak. Yet more long-running characters, such as Diane Hunter and Benny Hawkins, were dropped; as with earlier changes, this was unpopular with viewers, who telephoned Central in protest. Smethurst gained the nickname \\"Butcher Bill\\" but was unfazed; he had, after all, reversed the declining fortunes of the BBC radio soap The Archers. Smethurst insisted he only got the flak because his was the name the public knew.Interview with William Smethurst Further changes included the series being renamed Crossroads Kings Oak for a time, with the intention in the future of shortening this to merely King's Oak. However, this final change was overtaken by the decision in June 1987 by Andy Allen, Central's director of programmes, to axe the series. The familiar theme tune was replaced in September 1987 by a new theme composed by Max Early and Raf Ravenscroft. New titles were introduced to accompany the new theme, which featured stills of King's Oak and the new King's Oak Country Hotel. Michele Buck guided the show through its final few months on air as series producer, with William Smethurst still on hand as executive producer. In January 1988, the series was reduced to only two episodes a week, with Crossroads King's Oak finally coming to an end on 4 April 1988 (the Easter bank holiday). The last, extended episode saw the character of Jill (Jane Rossington) riding off with her lover, John Maddingham (Jeremy Nicholas). Asked what name she would give the hotel she would be running in her new life, the character remarked, a little sadly, \\"I always thought Crossroads was an awfully good name\\". Carlton era Crossroads title sequence (2001‚Äì02). In April 2000, Carlton Television announced that they would be reviving Crossroads for the daytime slot on ITV. The first revived episode was broadcast on 5 March 2001 with a glossy format (Carlton having bought Central back in 1994) to the surprise of the wider media.John Williams \\"Crossroads - The 2000s\\", BFI screenonline The revived series was sponsored by washing detergent Surf and was broadcast each weekday at 1.30pm and 5.05pm on ITV, with a Sunday omnibus on ITV2. The revived series was also broadcast in Ireland on RT√â One and in New Zealand on TV One. Four characters from the original series returned: Doris Luke (Kathy Staff), Jill Harvey (n√©e Richardson), Jill's ex-husband Adam Chance (Tony Adams), and Jill's daughter Sarah-Jane Harvey (Joanne Farrell/Holly Newman). Initial reactions were favourable; however, changes in story from the original were puzzling for fans and did not help ratings. Kathy Staff left in dismay at the amount of sex, and told ITV Teletext she felt it was no longer the family- friendly show she had originally been part of. The decision to kill original character Jill Harvey, who was murdered by ex-husband Adam Chance three months into the series' revival, proved unpopular with fans of the original show.Jane Rossington Interview Jane Rossington said she did not want to commit herself to another long run in the show, but warned Carlton it would be suicidal to kill Jill. 150px Episode 137 of the second revived series remains the only episode never to be shown in full on ITV. The lunchtime screening on Tuesday 11 September 2001 began at 14:10, but during the advertisement break, the programme was interrupted by ITV News with coverage of the 9/11 attacks in New York City. A short recap of events in Episode 137 was screened before both the 14:10 and 17:05 showings of Episode 138 on 12 September 2001, and the episode was included in the Omnibus edition that Sunday. The series was reduced to four episodes a week from November 2001 until January 2002. The series went into a hiatus from August 2002 to January 2003, during which time further changes were made. The remodelled series, under producer Yvon Grace, appeared to be a self-consciously camp parody, with Jane Asher playing a new central character - the glamorous and bitchy Angel Samson. The series also featured appearances from Kate O'Mara, and people associated with light entertainment, such as Lionel Blair, Les Dennis and Tim Brooke-Taylor. The revived series also launched the careers of Freema Agyeman (Doctor Who, Law & Order: UK), Luke Roberts (Holby City and Mile High), Lucy Pargeter, Shauna Shim and Jessica Fox. Yvon Grace admitted she was aiming the new Crossroads towards the LGBT TV audience, but fans were not happy with her ambivalence towards unresolved storylines from the 2001‚Äì2002 run.Crossroads Story - 1964 to 2003 Plans were in place to bring Adam Chance back on a three-month contract in a last attempt to bring in more viewers; actor Tony Adams said that a down-on- his luck Adam would have been taken under Angel's wing as her personal assistant.Tony Adams Interview With ratings continuing to decline, the revived series was also axed in March 2003, with the final episode being broadcast on Friday 30 May 2003. The 2003 series was criticised by fans who felt the series had moved away from the 1964‚Äì88 series and the 2001‚Äì02 series, as well as being \\"too gay\\". Later, Jane Asher apologised to fans as a result of the way the 2003 series went. Theme tune The Crossroads theme tune was composed by Tony Hatch. In 2004 Hatch said: A selection of cues were recorded, including Meg's Theme which eventually became the standard opening theme, Kitty's Theme which was phased out as action focussed on the motel, the closing theme which combined both Meg's and Kitty's themes, and a variety of background pieces. A rerecording by The Tony Hatch Sound was issued as a single by Pye Records in 1965. A special arrangement of the theme by Paul McCartney and Wings, was also used from the late seventies, usually when an episode ended with a dramatic event. Central Independent Television's head of music Johnny Patrick rearranged the tune in 1985 for piano and synthesiser, upon the show's relaunch as Crossroads Motel by producer Philip Bowman. Following William Smethurst's arrival as producer in 1987, this recording was overdubbed with added synthesisers. An entirely new theme aired in late 1987 when the series was relaunched as Crossroads, Kings Oak, composed by Johnny Patrick, with Raf Ravenscroft and Max Early, with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. This later formed the basis of the single released by actress Shona Linsdey, \\"Goodbye\\", to commemorate the end of the show in 1988. The 2001 revival brought back the original Tony Hatch theme, this time arranged and performed by TV theme composer Tony Flynn.http://www.crossroads2001.co.uk/interviewtonyflynn.htm Another version, in 2003, was arranged by Patrick Dineen and performed by the Liverpool Philharmonic. Locations The fictional Crossroads Motel was in an equally fictional village near Birmingham, Kings Oak (there are real suburbs in south- west Birmingham called Kings Heath, Kings Norton and Selly Oak). A number of real-life hotels doubled for location filming; it is stated in the 1982 Crossroads Special that the Longshoot Motel (Nuneaton) was used as a 'blueprint' in designing the motel and it is likely that some scenes were filmed there during the run of the series. right In 1970, the series gained an O.B unit, giving it the freedom to do location shooting. Originally, Tanworth- in-Arden was used for King's Oak, although outside scenes were only occasionally used. Under Central, more location shooting began to be featured. Some early King's Oak location material was also filmed in Wolverhampton. The most famous location - as seen in the programme during the 1960s and 1970s was not a motel at all, but The Shropshire Agricultural Institution (now called North Shropshire College). In October 2019 two of the buildings used during filming, teaching block and Bridden accommodation block were removed from the site. It has also been suggested that Crossroads was filmed at a 1960s motel on Stratford Road in Alcester Warwickshire called CherryTrees (the buildings were demolished in 2001 and a care home was built), however it was a nearby petrol station (now closed) that was used in the early 1980s for filming a couple of outdoor scenes of the Crossroads garage. After the in-story destruction of the motel by fire, the revamped motel was filmed from 1982 at the Golden Valley Hotel (now Jurys Inn) in Cheltenham; at Gloucestershire on Screen from 1985 filming moved to the Penns Hall Hotel (now Ramada Jarvis Birmingham) in Sutton Coldfield, the changed appearance explained as being due to rebuilding. At the time of the move to Sutton Coldfield, new studio sets were also introduced. Other locations included the canal (including Gas Street Basin) behind the studios in Birmingham; in-story this was the King's Oak Canal, on which Vera had a barge. The Chateau Impney Hotel also featured numerous times, most famously when Hugh proposed to Meg in 1973, and it was used to hold their wedding party two years later. The Chateau Impney was renamed the Droitwich Hotel on-screen. St Laurence's Church in Alvechurch was the setting for Jill and Adam Chance's wedding in 1983. Hagley Hall was used for the wedding reception. Helios Health Club based in Brierley Hill was used as the location for the Motel Health Club, filmed on Mondays when the health club was closed. In 1985, Crossroads gained its first set of full length opening titles, filmed around Sutton Coldfield, Tanworth-in-Arden and in Birmingham city centre. The revived Crossroads from 2001 was still set in the West Midlands; however, exterior shots were filmed at locations in and around Nottingham, such as Bingham and Redmile. The original series was recorded at ATV's/Central's Broad Street studios in Birmingham, while the revived series was filmed at Carlton Studios in Nottingham. Critical reception The critics hated the show from the start. Yet it struck a chord with the public and trounced rival daytime soaps like General Hospital. Because it was made on a shoestring budget, and because of the number of episodes produced per week, its flaws became inevitable. The sets wobbled, actors fluffed their lines and some popular characters just disappeared. One example of this was Benny Hawkins (played by Paul Henry). He was last seen on screen ascending a ladder to put a fairy at the top of a Christmas tree and never reappeared again in the show.The One Show:Book of True Tales; 2017; pages 195‚Äì196; Despite the popularity of Crossroads with the viewing public, the show was often criticised by TV reviewers and ridiculed by British comedians. Television historian Hilary Kingsley stated that Crossroads never failed \\"to provide its critics with ammunition. Some of the acting would have disgraced the humblest of village halls; many of the plots were so farcical they could have been written in a bad dream, and much of the dialogue was pathetic.\\" The Guinness Book of Classic British TV noted that \\"Crossroads was the series that no-one seemed to love. Yet at its peak, it was watched by more viewers than any other soap except Coronation Street.\\" The revived series also received mixed reviews from critics.  Acorn Antiques  Spoof soap opera Acorn Antiques, created by comedian Victoria Wood as part of Victoria Wood As Seen On TV, is a deliberate parody of Crossroads. The final episode of As Seen on TV in 1987 features a hoax documentary, 'The Making of Acorn Antiques', in which the actress playing Mrs Overall (Julie Walters) - a character based on Crossroads characters Amy Turtle and Mavis Hooper - is revealed as a rather grand character who considers herself a huge star. This portrayal, plus a later pretend news item in which it is revealed she has been sacked from the show, both suggest the actress character (later given the name Bo Beaumont in the musical based on the sketches) is based on Noele Gordon, with Bo making her 'goodbye' appearance to the press in headscarf and large sunglasses and making a dramatic speech, just as Gordon did. DVD release Network issued four volumes of the series on DVD (UK Region 2) in 2005, with 12 of the original ATV episodes in each volume (the first release including Meg's 1975 wedding, the highest rated episode). The third release was delayed due to the loss of ATV documents listing which episodes still exist, and Granada Television staff having to use other resources to locate episodes. Crossroads Volume 3 was released on 26 February 2007. There are two versions of the DVD, one being a special limited edition, which contains an extra third disc - featuring recently found episodes from 1976. Crossroads Volume 4 was released on 17 September 2007. Network was in the process of releasing all known surviving episodes (at the time) in transmission order exclusively through its website. The first set of 16 episodes was released in January 2008 and contained some episodes not previously available on earlier DVD releases. There are apparently 1,700 episodes of Crossroads in existence; most of these are from Central Television's run of the show from 1982 to 1988. Over 20 archive volumes of Crossroads, \\"with each and every surviving episode in transmission order\\", have been released so far, with Crossroads Archive Volume 20 the most recently released, in April 2009. On 2 November 2009, to coincide with the show's 45th anniversary, Network re-released the 21 volumes - including Volume 1.1, see below - in a 41-disc box-set. Susan Hanson, who played Diane Hunter, appeared on The Alan Titchmarsh Show and Loose Women on 6 and 13 November 2009 respectively, to promote the box-set. A black and white Crossroads Archive Volume 1.1 has also been released, containing the episode from April 1965, along with 2 further episodes (nos. 1884 and 1886 from March 1973, which were both originally made in colour but now survive only as black and white telerecordings). Repeats From 1996 until 2001, episodes of the original series were repeated on UKTV channel UK Gold. For a brief period between February and September 2015, the original series aired on Big Centre TV on Freeview channel 8 in the Midlands or available online live at 9.00pm each evening Monday to Saturday, which could also be watched free on their catchup service.

His surname is often preceded by ha-Levi, as he descended from a family of Levites. Biography Yechiel Michel Epstein was born into a family of wealthy army contractors for the Czarist Russian army in Babruysk, Russian Empire (presently in Belarus). His wife was the sister of Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin (the Netziv), who would become the rosh yeshiva (head) of the Volozhin Yeshiva. (Berlin was later to marry a daughter of Epstein, after being widowed of his first wife.) Epstein studied Torah locally, and was encouraged to do so by the town's rabbi and his parents (the concept of an out-of-town yeshiva was only slowly gaining ascendancy). After his marriage he received semicha (rabbinic ordination) and accepted his first rabbinical position. Epstein became the rabbi of Novozybkov (east of Gomel, now Bryansk region), a town with a large number of Hasidic Jews, mainly adherents of Chabad Lubavitch. Nine years after accepting his position in Novozybkov, in 1863, Epstein was appointed as the rabbi of Navahrudak, where he would serve for 34 years, until his death. Here, he was recognised as a posek (decisor of Jewish law), and he was to compose most of his writings in Navahrudak. Epstein was involved in many charitable endeavors. He was particularly close to Rabbi Shmuel Salant, the chief rabbi of Jerusalem, and wrote extensively on the obligation of all Jews to support the Rabbi Meir Baal Haneis charity that Rabbi Salant founded in Israel in 1860. Epstein died on 22 Adar II 5668 (1908), and is buried in Navahrudak. His son, Rabbi Baruch Epstein, was a bookkeeper by profession but produced a number of scholarly and popular works, most notably the Torah Temimah.

It was a refinement of Brentano's neo- Aristotelian theory or the study of phenomena's qualitative properties. Stumpf influenced his pupils such as Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, Wolfgang K√∂hler, and Kurt Lewin, and these contributed to the school's development. Lewin, for instance, developed a set of models and ideas linked to change management theory and practice. These psychologists further refined Stumpf's work, which facilitated experimental investigation that culminated in the development of Gestalt psychology. These psychologists stressed the primacy of objects as units of experience, instead of sensations. Only after K√∂hler took over the direction of the psychology institute in 1922 did the Berlin School effectively become a school for Gestalt psychology.

They are clones, meaning that they are genetically identical to the mother plant. They divide mitotically. In the plant nursery business and gardens, they are detached and grown in order to produce new plants. This is a cheap and simple process for those plants that readily produce offsets as it does not usually require specialist materials and equipment. Offsets form when meristem regions of plants, such as axillary buds or homologous structures, differentiate into a new plant with the ability to become self-sustaining. This is particularly common in species that develop underground storage organs, such as bulbs, corms and tubers. Tulips and lilies are examples of plants that display offset characteristics by forming cormlets around the original mother corm. It is a means of plant propagation. When propagating plants to increase a stock of a cultivar, thus seeking identical copies of parent plant, various cloning techniques (asexual reproduction) are used. Offsets are a natural means by which plants may be cloned. In contrast, when propagating plants to create new cultivars, sexual reproduction through pollination is used to create seeds. The recombination of genes gives rise to offspring plant with similar but distinct offspring genome.

The Metroads formed a network of radial and circumferential routes throughout the cities, simplifying navigation. Metroads have been progressively phased out in both Sydney and Brisbane, replaced by alphanumeric route numbers in Sydney and either alphanumeric or state route markers in Brisbane. Brisbane is the only city currently retaining the Metroad system. History Former National Route 1 and Metroad 1 route markers at Waterfall, NSW in 2005. Historically, National Routes passed through city centres and formed some of the main thoroughfares within Australia's largest cities. However urban growth led to massive congestion in the inner city areas. To bypass these centres, new roads were either constructed or main suburban roads were linked together to form ring roads linking one National Route to the other. The earliest scheme was adopted in Sydney in 1964, the Ring Road scheme. They had special markers for identification. Growth of urban sprawl made intra-urban navigation difficult. Many States introduced State Route systems in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s and many roads within metropolitan areas were included. This scheme was adopted by most major cities. In Sydney the State Routes superseded the Ring Road scheme. Urban freeways in Sydney and Brisbane had their own route marking scheme. However, it was later realised that the multiplicity of urban route marking schemes led to confusion. In the 1990s, these were streamlined in the new Metroad scheme. This scheme ensures that main priority routes are clearly identified and marked. As far as possible, urban freeways are absorbed into the system. It was adopted in Sydney in 1993 and Brisbane in 1996. Metroads usually completely replaced the State Routes and National Routes along their routes; however, State Routes not on designated Metroads were usually left untampered. Metroad routes in both Sydney and Brisbane are being replaced by alphanumeric routes. Brisbane Metroads began to be phased out around 2010 with currently only 2 active routes, with Sydney Metroads completely phased out at the end of 2013. As of 2015, the Department of Main Roads in Queensland have no plans to convert/decommission the remaining Metroad sections within Brisbane. List of Metroads Sydney Metroads The Metroad navigation system was introduced to Sydney in 1992, with six routes (Metroads 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7). The scheme was extended in 1998-1999 with the signposting of Metroads 6, 9 and 10 (there was never a Metroad 8).

Today, the loop siding has been provided again along with the platform track, but the crossing loop is yet to be rebuilt. A platform exists which initially had a temporary non-heritage building provided for safeworking purposes only, but during 2007 a heritage type building, obtained second-hand from another Victorian station, was relocated to Cockatoo. Although it is not representative of the original building, it nevertheless is a typical building of the day and now provides a more suitable safeworking office than the non- heritage building previously used for this purpose, which was subsequently removed in 2009. Whilst trains normally stop at Cockatoo, very few passengers join or alight. Plans to recreate all structures on the platform to their mid-1920s configuration are well advanced with a start to be made in the very near future.

Billings (September 27, 1823 - September 30, 1890) was an American lawyer and financier. From 1879 to 1881 he was President of the Northern Pacific Railway. Early life He was born in Royalton, Windsor County, Vermont. He attended Kimball Union Academy and graduated from the University of Vermont in 1844. Career Originally a Whig and later a Republican, from 1846 to 1848 he served as Secretary of Civil and Military Affairs (chief assistant) to Governor Horace Eaton. He studied law with Oliver P. Chandler and attained admission to the bar in 1848. Gold rush In 1848, during the California Gold Rush, he moved to San Francisco, becoming the city's first land claims lawyer. He later partnered with Henry Halleck, Trenor W. Park and others in the law firm of Halleck, Peachy & Billings, which became a leading law firm in San Francisco. While in California, he was a trustee of the College of California (later, the University of California at Berkeley) and suggested that the college be named for George Berkeley. Return to Vermont In 1864, he returned to Woodstock, Vermont, and in 1869 purchased George Perkins Marsh's former estate. Billings had read Marsh's pioneering volume on ecology called Man and Nature, and set about to put into practice his theories on conservation. Billings and his heirs set about purchasing many failing farms and reforesting much of the surrounding hillsides with Norway Spruce, Scots Pine, European Larch, and many native species. Today, the Marsh- Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park in Woodstock manages and interprets what is probably the oldest managed forest in the United States. The Billings Farm & Museum is a working dairy farm and museum, located just across the street. It is the gateway to learning about Vermont's agricultural history. Candidate for Governor of Vermont In 1872 Billings was a candidate for the Republican nomination for Governor of Vermont. The Republican nomination was then tantamount to election, and Billings, who was Chairman of the convention, had a large group of delegates pledged to him. However, a large number opposed Billings on the grounds that he had been away from Vermont for so long. In addition, delegates opposed the renomination of Governor John W. Stewart, arguing that it would violate the party's \\"Mountain Rule.\\" The nomination went to Julius Converse even though he was not an active candidate.University of Vermont Alumni Association, University of Vermont Obituary Record, Volume 1, 1895, page 85Jacob Ullery, Men of Vermont Illustrated, 1894, page 100 Northern Pacific Railway Billings later purchased one of the original twelfth interests in the Northern Pacific Railway and, from 1879 to 1881, served as its president. In 1880 he was a delegate to the Republican National Convention, and made the nominating speech for George F. Edmunds.Norman E. Tutorow, James Gillespie Blaine and the Presidency, 1989, pages 57, 381 Death and burial Billings died in Woodstock on September 30, 1890.New York Times, Frederick Billings Dead, September 30, 1890 He is buried at River Street Cemetery in Woodstock. Family Billings was married to Julia Parmly, daughter of Dr. Eleazer Parmly. Together, they were the parents of seven children: *Parmly Billings (February 6, 1863 ‚Äì May 7, 1888) *Laura Billings (Mrs. Frederic Schiller Lee) (August 20, 1864 ‚Äì November 5, 1938) *Frederick Billings (December 23, 1866 ‚Äì May 5, 1913) *Mary Montagu Billings (March 6, 1869 ‚Äì 1951) *Elizabeth Billings (1871 ‚Äì 1944) *Ehrick Billings (October 17, 1872 ‚Äì October 17, 1889) *Richard Billings (1875 ‚Äì 1931) He was the grandfather of Mary French Rockefeller, wife of Laurance Rockefeller.Peter S.

Billings and great- uncle of Judge Franklin S. Billings, Jr. Philanthropy He constructed a chapel for the Congregational Church of Woodstock. Although he never owned a home in Billings, Montana, a railroad town established in 1882 and named after him, he provided the money to build the First Congregational Church. His son and daughter provided the financial support to build the Parmly Billings Memorial Library in Billings, Montana. Frederick Billings endowed Billings Library, completed in 1885 for the University of Vermont, and purchased the George Perkins Marsh collection of 12,000 volumes for it.

The Victorian Railways officially named it Fielder from Tuesday 5 February 1929,Victorian Railways Weekly Notice No. 6/29 dated 5/2/29 after a nearby resident. It was planned to name the station after the two local residents Cullen and Fielder and combinations of the two names were suggested, however Fielder was the name finally chosen. It remained nothing more than a Mallee shed with small office and a name board for the rest of its operating life. It was closed with the line on 30 April 1954 and the Mallee shed was sold to US Buslines for unknown use. After closure, the site fell into disrepair, and by the 1990s, little trace of Fielder remained. However, by that time, efforts were being made to extend the railway from Lakeside through to Gembrook, which would complete the entire length of the original line. In 1996, a group of volunteers led by Richard Schurmann in collaboration with the descendants of the Fielder family rebuilt the platform and waiting shed, which was officially re-opened on Saturday 19 April 1997 in preparation for the extension of the line which re- opened in 1998.

Uncommonly, flowers may have no axis of symmetry at all, typically because their parts are spirally arranged.  Actinomorphic  Wurmbea stricta, its tepals in actinomorphic arrangement Most flowers are actinomorphic (\\"star shaped\\", \\"radial\\"), meaning they can be divided into 3 or more identical sectors which are related to each other by rotation about the centre of the flower. Typically, each sector might contain one tepal or one petal and one sepal and so on. It may or may not be possible to divide the flower into symmetrical halves by the same number of longitudinal planes passing through the axis: Oleander is an example of a flower without such mirror planes. Actinomorphic flowers are also called radially symmetrical or regular flowers. Other examples of actinomorphic flowers are the lily (Lilium, Liliaceae) and the buttercup (Ranunculus, Ranunculaceae).  Zygomorphic  Satyrium carneum. Ground orchid with typical zygomorphic floral anatomy Zygomorphic (\\"yoke shaped\\", \\"bilateral\\" ‚Äì from the Greek Œ∂œÖŒ≥œåŒΩ, zygon, yoke, and ŒºŒøœÅœÜŒÆ, morphe, shape) flowers can be divided by only a single plane into two mirror-image halves, much like a yoke or a person's face. Examples are orchids and the flowers of most members of the Lamiales (e.g., Scrophulariaceae and Gesneriaceae). Some authors prefer the term monosymmetry or bilateral symmetry.  Asymmetry  A few plant species have flowers lacking any symmetry, and therefore having a \\"handedness\\". Examples: Valeriana officinalis and Canna indica.  Differences  Actinomorphic flowers are a basal angiosperm character; zygomorphic flowers are a derived character that has evolved many times. Some familiar and seemingly actinomorphic so-called flowers, such as those of daisies and dandelions (Asteraceae), and most species of Protea, are actually clusters of tiny (not necessarily actinomorphic) flowers arranged into a roughly radially symmetric inflorescence of the form known as a head, capitulum, or pseudanthium.  Peloria  Digitalis purpurea (common foxglove) displaying an aberrant peloric terminal flower and normal zygomorphic flowers Peloria or a peloric flower is the aberration in which a plant that normally produces zygomorphic flowers produces actinomorphic flowers instead. This aberration can be developmental, or it can have a genetic basis: the CYCLOIDEA gene controls floral symmetry. Peloric Antirrhinum plants have been produced by knocking out this gene. Many modern cultivars of Sinningia speciosa (\\"gloxinia\\") have been bred to have peloric flowers as they are larger and showier than the normally zygomorphic flowers of this species. Charles Darwin explored peloria in Antirrhinum (snapdragon) while researching the inheritance of floral characteristics for his The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication. Later research, using Digitalis purpurea, showed that his results were largely in line with Mendelian theory. Symmetry groups If we consider only those flowers which consist in a single flower, rather than a flower head or inflorescence, we can group the flowers into a relatively small number of 2D symmetry groups. Monocots are identifiable by their trimerous petals, thus monocots often have rotational symmetry of order 3. If the flower also has 3 lines of mirror symmetry the group it belongs to is the dihedral group D3. If not, then it belongs to the cyclic group C3. Eudicots with tetramerous or pentamerous petals may have rotational symmetry of order 4 or 5. Again, whether they also have mirror planes decides whether they belong to dihedral (D4 and D5) or cyclic groups (C4 or C5). The sepals of some monocot flowers develop to replicate the petals, thus, superficially, certain monocots can appear to have rotational symmetry of order 6 and belong to either symmetry group D6 or C6. However, flower symmetry is rarely perfect.

The first station on the site was built in 1888‚Äì1889 when the railway line was extended from Lilydale to Healesville. The settlement had been previously named Burgoyne, but when the railway was extended, the decision was made to rename it Yarra Glen. Though Yarra Glen was a small settlement, its station was often used for supplying Melbourne with produce from nearby farms. The station closed along with the Healesville line in 1980. It sat idle for some years, and suffered some major fire damage to the roof. However, the station is being restored by the Yarra Valley Railway, which is based at Healesville railway station. The railway is currently open on weekends and public holidays, offering return trips from Healesville through the tunnel near Tarrawarra and back, using Walker railmotor RM22. The Black Saturday bushfires on 7 February 2009 burnt a good deal of grassland and forest in the Yarra Valley. The fire also caused the destruction of 13 timber trestle bridges between Yarra Glen Station and Healesville. Bridges of varying lengths were lost, the main ones being those on the Yarra River flats, including a long one over the river itself. The bridges, between Yarra Glen and Yering, are visible from the Melba Highway when approaching Yarra Glen. Six other bridges were destroyed, which were not part of the Yarra Valley Railway, and sleepers were burnt out over approx 2 km, also outside the running section of the railway. Until the 13 bridges and associated rail track can be restored to operating condition, Yarra Glen station is orphaned from the remaining part of the Yarra Valley Railway.

The singular values are non-negative real numbers, usually listed in decreasing order (s1(T), s2(T), ‚Ä¶). The largest singular value s1(T) is equal to the operator norm of T (see Min-max theorem). Visualisation of a singular value decomposition (SVD) of a 2-dimensional, real shearing matrix M. First, we see the unit disc in blue together with the two canonical unit vectors. We then see the action of M, which distorts the disc to an ellipse. The SVD decomposes M into three simple transformations: a rotation V, a scaling Œ£ along the rotated coordinate axes and a second rotation U. Œ£ is a diagonal matrix containing in its diagonal the singular values of M, which represent the lengths œÉ1 and œÉ2 of the semi-axes of the ellipse. If T acts on euclidean space Rn, there is a simple geometric interpretation for the singular values: Consider the image by T of the unit sphere; this is an ellipsoid, and the lengths of its semi-axes are the singular values of T (the figure provides an example in R2). The singular values are the absolute values of the eigenvalues of a normal matrix A, because the spectral theorem can be applied to obtain unitary diagonalization of A as . Therefore, \\\\sqrt{A^*A} = \\\\sqrt{U \\\\Lambda^2 U^*} = U\\\\ \\\\Lambda\\\\ U^*. Most norms on Hilbert space operators studied are defined using s-numbers. For example, the Ky Fan-k-norm is the sum of first k singular values, the trace norm is the sum of all singular values, and the Schatten norm is the pth root of the sum of the pth powers of the singular values. Note that each norm is defined only on a special class of operators, hence s-numbers are useful in classifying different operators. In the finite-dimensional case, a matrix can always be decomposed in the form UŒ£V, where U and V are unitary matrices and Œ£ is a diagonal matrix with the singular values lying on the diagonal.

Description They are clump-forming, rhizomatous, evergreen perennials with a spirally arranged rosette of leaves 6‚Äì35 cm long and 4‚Äì15 cm broad, and pink flowers produced in a cyme. The leaves are large, leathery, ovate or cordate, and often have wavy or saw-toothed edges. For most of the year, the leaves have a glossy green colour, but in cooler climates, they turn red or bronze in the fall. The flowers grow on a stem similar in colour to a rhubarb stalk and most varieties have cone-shaped flowers in varying shades of pink. These can range from almost white to ruby red and purple. The common names for Bergenia are pigsqueak (due to the sound produced when two leaves are rubbed together), elephant's ears (due to the shape of the leaves) and large rockfoil. Bergenia is closely related to Mukdenia, Oresitrophe, Astilboides and Rodgersia. The creator of the taxonomic genus name, Conrad Moench, honoured the German botanist and physician Karl August von Bergen by coining the name Bergenia in 1794. Species Fruit of Bergenia cordifolia * Bergenia ciliata, including the cultivar Bergenia ciliata 'Superba' * Bergenia crassifolia (syn. Bergenia cordifolia) is the most widely grown garden plant, especially the cultivar Bergenia cordifolia 'Purpurea.' The species epithet crassifolia means thick-leaved, and cordifolia means cordate (heart-shaped) leaf (although the leaves may also be described as spoon-shaped). It grows to about 30 cm tall. The leaves are winter hardy and change color in the range of rust brown to brown-red. Other cultivars are Bergenia cordifolia 'Winterglut', Bergenia cordifolia 'Senior', and Bergenia crassifolia 'Autumn Red'. * Bergenia emeiensis * Bergenia ligulata * Bergenia pacumbis * Bergenia purpurascens is 30 - 40 cm tall and has carmine-red flowers. The leaves are oval-shaped. **Bergenia purpurascens var. delavayi is ca. 50 cm tall with small leaves and rosy red flowers. * Bergenia scopulosa * Bergenia stracheyi with the cultivars Bergenia stracheyi 'Alba' and Bergenia stracheyi 'Afghanica' * Bergenia tianquanensis Cultivation Bergenia are hardy plants that can grow in climates with extreme temperature ranges from about to . They prefer sun but will grow in shady areas as well. Plants can grow to about tall and wide. They do well in most soils, but moist, humus-rich soil is preferable. Exposure and dry soils tend to stunt growth, but can enhance the winter leaf colours. In areas with cold, strong winter winds, protection from the wind may be required. They are propagated by division or rooted rhizome sections. Bergenia 'Bressingham White' Bergenia crassifolia, Bergenia cordifolia, and various hybrids are often grown in gardens, with several cultivars selected. The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:- *B. cordifolia 'Rosa Zeiten' *B. purpurascens *B. purpurascens var. delavayi *'Biedermeier' *'Bressingham White' *'Britten' *'Claire Maxine' *'Eden's Magic Giant' *'Eric Smith' *'Eroica' *'Frau Holle' (pale pink) *'Sunningdale' *'Irish Crimson' *'Morgenr√∂te' *'Pugsley's Pink' *'Silberlicht' *'Winterm√§rchen' Pests and diseases Bergenia are robust plants and generally free of problems, although vine weevil adults readily eat the edges of the leaves, resulting in an indented, 'notched' outline which can detract from the appearance of the plant. Uses Bergenin, C-glycoside of 4-O-methyl gallic acid, and its O-demethylated derivative norbergenin, are chemical compounds and drugs of Ayurveda, commonly known as Paashaanbhed.

In practice, most force majeure clauses do not excuse a party's non-performance entirely, but only suspend it for the duration of the force majeure.Principle of Force Majeure (including international references), Trans-Lex.org Force majeure is generally intended to include occurrences beyond the reasonable control of a party, and therefore would not cover: *Any result of the negligence or malfeasance of a party, which has a materially adverse effect on the ability of such party to perform its obligations. *Any result of the usual and natural consequences of external forces. **To illuminate this distinction, take the example of an outdoor public event abruptly called off. ***If the cause for cancellation is ordinary predictable rain, this is most probably not force majeure. ***If the cause is a flash flood that damages the venue or makes the event hazardous to attend, then this almost certainly is force majeure, other than where the venue was on a known flood plain or the area of the venue was known to be subject to torrential rain.Trade and Transport Inc v Iino Kaiun Kasiha Ltd [1973] 1 WLR 210 at 224 to 227; cf Channel Island Ferries Ltd v Sealink United Kingdom Ltd [1988] 1 Lloyd's Reports 323 ***Some causes might be arguable borderline cases (for instance, if unusually heavy rain occurred, rendering the event significantly more difficult, but not impossible, to safely hold or attend); these must be assessed in light of the circumstances. *Any circumstances that are specifically contemplated (included) in the contract‚Äîfor example, if the contract for the outdoor event specifically permits or requires cancellation in the event of rain. Under international law, it refers to an irresistible force or unforeseen event beyond the control of a state making it materially impossible to fulfill an international obligation, and is related to the concept of a state of emergency. Force majeure in any given situation is controlled by the law governing the contract, rather than general concepts of force majeure. The law of the contract often specified by a choice of law clause in the agreement, and if not is decided by a statute or principles of general law which apply to the contract. The first step to assess whether - and how - force majeure applies to any particular contract is to ascertain the law of the country which governs the contract. Purpose Time-critical and other sensitive contracts may be drafted to limit the shield of this clause where a party does not take reasonable steps (or specific precautions) to prevent or limit the effects of the outside interference, either when they become likely or when they actually occur. A force majeure may work to excuse all or part of the obligations of one or both parties. For example, a strike might prevent timely delivery of goods, but not timely payment for the portion delivered. A force majeure may also be the overpowering force itself, which prevents the fulfillment of a contract. In that instance, it is actually the impossibility or impracticability defenses. In the military, force majeure has a slightly different meaning. It refers to an event, either external or internal, that happens to a vessel or aircraft that allows it to enter normally restricted areas without penalty. An example would be the Hainan Island incident where a U.S. Navy aircraft landed at a Chinese military airbase after a collision with a Chinese fighter in April 2001. Under the principle of force majeure, the aircraft must be allowed to land without interference. The importance of the force majeure clause in a contract, particularly one of any length in time, cannot be overstated as it relieves a party from an obligation under the contract (or suspends that obligation). What is permitted to be a force majeure event or circumstance can be the source of much controversy in the negotiation of a contract and a party should generally resist any attempt by the other party to include something that should, fundamentally, be at the risk of that other party. For example, in a coal-supply agreement, the mining company may seek to have \\"geological risk\\" included as a force majeure event; however, the mining company should be doing extensive exploration and analysis of its geological reserves and should not even be negotiating a coal-supply agreement if it cannot take the risk that there may be a geological limit to its coal supply from time to time. The outcome of that negotiation, of course, depends on the relative bargaining power of the parties and there will be cases where force majeure clauses can be used by a party effectively to escape liability for bad performance. Because of the different interpretations of force majeure across legal systems, it is common for contracts to include specific definitions of force majeure, particularly at the international level. Some systems limit force majeure to an Act of God (such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, etc.) but exclude human or technical failures (such as acts of war, terrorist activities, labor disputes, or interruption or failure of electricity or communications systems). The advisory point is in drafting of contract make distinction between act of God and other shape of force majeure. As a consequence, force majeure in areas prone to natural disaster requires a definition of the magnitude of the event for which force majeure could be considered as such in a contract. As an example, in a highly seismic area a technical definition of the amplitude of motion at the site could be established on the contract, based for example on probability of occurrence studies. This parameter or parameters can later be monitored at the construction site (with a commonly agreed procedure). An earthquake could be a small shaking or damaging event. The occurrence of an earthquake does not imply the occurrence of damage or disruption. For small and moderate events it is reasonable to establish requirements for the contract processes; for large events it is not always feasible or economical to do so. Concepts such as 'damaging earthquake' in force majeure clauses do not help to clarify disruption, especially in areas where there are no other reference structures or most structures are not seismically safe.  Common law  When force majeure has not been provided for in the contract (or the relevant event does not fall within the scope of the force majeure clause), and a supervening event prevents performance, it will be a breach of contract. The law of frustration will be the sole remaining course available to the party in default to end the contract. If the failure to perform the contract deprives the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit of the contract it will be a repudiatory breach, entitling the innocent party to terminate the contract and claim damages for that repudiatory breach.Hongkong Fir Shipping Co. Ltd. v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. [1962] 2 QB 26 at 69-70 As interpreted by English courts, the phrase force majeure has a more extensive meaning than \\"act of God\\" or vis major. Judges have agreed that strikes and breakdowns of machinery, which though normally not included in vis major, are included in force majeure. (However, in the case of machinery breakdown, negligent lack of maintenance may negate claims of force majeure, as maintenance or its lack is within the owner's sphere of control.) The term cannot, however, be extended to cover delays caused by bad weather, football matches, or a funeral: the English case of Matsoukis v. Priestman & Co (1915) held that \\"these are the usual incidents interrupting work, and the defendants, in making their contract, no doubt took them into account.... The words 'force majeure' are not words which we generally find in an English contract. They are taken from the Code Napoleon, and they were inserted by this Romanian gentleman or by his advisers, who were no doubt familiar with their use on the Continent.\\" In Hackney Borough Council v. Dore (1922) it was held that \\"The expression means some physical or material restraint and does not include a reasonable fear or apprehension of such a restraint\\". In re Dharnrajmal Gobindram v. Shamji Kalidas [All India Reporter 1961 Supreme Court (of India) 1285], it was held that \\"An analysis of ruling on the subject shows that reference to the expression is made where the intention is to save the defaulting party from the consequences of anything over which he had no control.\\" Even if a force majeure clause covers the relevant supervening event, the party unable to perform will not have the benefit of the clause where performance merely become (1) more difficult, (2) more expensive, and/or (3) less profitable. For example, parties in the United States have used the COVID-19 pandemic as a force majeure in an attempt to escape contractual liability by applying the elements of an (1) unforeseeable event, (2) outside of the parties‚Äô control, that (3) renders performance impossible or impractical.  Civil law  France For a defendant to invoke force majeure in French law, the event proposed as force majeure must pass three tests: ; 1. Externality : The defendant must have nothing to do with the event's happening. ; 2. Unpredictability : If the event could be foreseen, the defendant is obligated to have prepared for it. Being unprepared for a foreseeable event leaves the defendant culpable. This standard is very strictly applied: * CE 9 April 1962, \\"Chais d‚ÄôArmagnac\\": The Council of State adjudged that, since a flood had occurred 69 years before the one that caused the damage at issue, the latter flood was predictable. * Administrative Court of Grenoble, 19 June 1974, \\"Dame Bosvy\\": An avalanche was judged to be predictable since another had occurred around 50 years before. ; 3. Irresistibility : The consequences of the event must have been unpreventable. Other events that are candidates for force majeure in French law are hurricanes and earthquakes. Force majeure is a defense against liability and is applicable throughout French law. Force majeure and cas fortuit are distinct notions in French Law. Germany On the other hand, German law does differentiate between vis major (') and casus fortuitus (') but, like English, tends to lump them together under h√∂here Gewalt which seems conceptually synonymous with the common law interpretation of force majeure, comprehending both natural disasters and events such as strikes, civil unrest, and war. However, even in the event of force majeure, liability persists in the face of default by a debtor.Schuldnerverzug, cf. BGB ¬ß287 (in German) ) or deprivation of property (Sachentziehung, cf. BGB ¬ß848 (in German) ) Argentina In Argentina, force majeure (fuerza mayor and caso fortuito) is defined by the Civil Code of Argentina in Article 512, and regulated in Article 513.CODIGO CIVIL DE LA NACION; INDICE TEMATICO infoleg.gov.ar (In Spanish) According to these articles, force majeure is defined by the following characteristics:Alterini, Ameal, Lopez Cabana \\"Derecho De Obligaciones\\" (In Spanish) * an event that could not have been foreseen or if it could, an event that could not be resisted. From these, it can be said that some acts of nature can be predicted, but if their consequences cannot be resisted it can be considered force majeure. * externality: the victim was not related directly or indirectly to the causes of the event, e.g., if the act was a fire, or a strike * unpredictability: the event must had been originated after the cause of the obligation. * irresistibility: the victim cannot by any means overcome the effects. In Argentina, Act of God can be used in Civil Responsibility regarding contractual or noncontractual obligations. UNIDROIT Principles Article 7.1.7 of the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts provides for a form of force majeure similar, but not identical, to the common law and civil law concepts of the term: relief from performance is granted \\"if that party proves that the non-performance was due to an impediment beyond its control and that it could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or overcome it or its consequences.\\"  See also  * Act of God * Contract law * Hardship clause * Hell or high water clause * Impossibility * Mutual assent * Substantial performance  References   Sources  * Mitra's Legal & Commercial Dictionary.

It was introduced in 1974, with the route going from Victoria Road in to Princes Highway in .State Route 45, Ozroads, Retrieved on 2 August 2013. State Route 45 underwent several realignments. The Lidcombe bypass opened in 1982 and State Route 45 was rerouted onto the bypass. In 1996, the Silverwater Road extension opened and State Route 45 was extended to Pennant Hills Road (Cumberland Highway). In 1999 Stacey Street was extended north to directly connect with Rookwood Rd, obviating the need for State Route 45 traffic to use the Hume Highway between these two roads. State Route 45 was replaced by Metroad 6 in January 1999. The northern terminus of Metroad 6 was the Marsden Rd/Pennant Hills Road intersection in Carlingford. When the then Metroad 7 was reassigned from Cumberland Highway to the Westlink M7 motorway when it was opened in December 2005, Metroad 6 was extended northwards to the M2 Hills Motorway. Metroad 6 was realigned between Menai and Barden Ridge, from Old Illawarra Road onto New Illawarra Road, which was completed between 2005 and 2011 as part of the Bangor Bypass project.

The Shrine of Our Ladye Star of the Sea was an old chapel on the cliffs at Broadstairs (which was formerly known as Bradstowe). Dating back at least to the 1350s, the two towers of the chapel were a major landmark for sailors in the area. Given the veneration in which the shrine was held, the custom developed of ships dipping their top-sails to salute the shrine as they sailed past it. quoting John Lewis's History of the Isle of Thanet (1736) The Chapel of St. Mary's structural remains are, as incorporated in the modern facade, situated on the site of what has been said also to be the oldest surviving building still standing in contemporary Broadstairs, and within its modern content is all that remains of the Medieval Shrine of \\"Our Lady of Bradstowe\\". It stands near the harbour on today's Albion Street, at the junction with Alexandra Road. History It is said that the Shrine and its Chapel were known to have existed prior to the year 1070, as it was in that year that the old Saxon Church of St. Peter's, then a wooden structure, was rebuilt with stone and flint. The original building contained a replica of what was even then the famous shrine of \\"Our Ladye of Bradstowe\\", but which seems then to have been moved to a private manor even closer to the shoreline than the surviving portion of the present building. The Shrine of the Culmer Chapel, a statue probably derived from the figure of the Virgin Mary, mounted on a tall column, was so positioned that it faced seaward. It thus stood outside in the Chapel garden before the cliffs. The Chapel being the gathering place for the maritime community in Broadstairs, has by this virtue alone an interesting history. The tradition maintained by the Royal Navy of \\"showing the flag\\" at seaside towns to uphold the morale of the Navy is said to have its origins in a service held at the Bradstowe Chapel in 1514 with the crew of the Henry Grace a Dieu in attendance, whilst the largest and latest addition to the King's Fleet was moored nearby. During the 1520s a severe storm that lasted several days swept into Viking Bay with a storm surge and destroyed the Shrine, badly damaging the Chapel. In 1601 the owner of the Chapel and the estate upon which it stood was Sir John Culmer, one of the first Congregationalist pioneers. It was he who had ordered the Chapel (and its Shrine) restored. Restoration in those dark times paid little heed to the integrity of the existing structure, consequently, and although much of the original material was reused in the restoration, the new Chapel was said not to be so picturesque as the original. It is well that some of the original ancient wall, a doorway and window have survived in the renovated structure. The Catholic Church of Our Lady Star of the Sea is named after the shrine The first Pastor in 1601 was Joel Culmer. It had been for some years even then the tradition of ships passing at Thanet to lower their top sail in salutation to the Shrine and Chapel, which was thought to bring a good fate to the passage of the ship. This had been the tradition until at least 1514, when Trinity House took over such duties for coastal towns and village's to display some kind of beacon on the high points of their coastline as a warning against the potential hazard's locally known to shipping, thus in medieval times the Chapel of St. Mary was known as \\"The Chapel of Blue Light\\", for its light was given out into the dark seas through a blue glass lantern. The Shrine was at some stage, probably 1601, placed inside the Chapel, for thereafter local seamen came to refer to it as \\"The Weeping Virgin\\". Hot weather is said to have caused humidity and thus condensation in the Chapel which settled on the face of the Shrine, and caused the figure to appear in the countenance of the Virgin, weeping. This effect was considered by religious mariners to be a bad omen as a storm would often follow, atmospheric changes indicated in the Chapel were thus a good rough guide to those who would face the perils of the sea. Legacy The shrine gives its name to the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady Star of the Sea which is inland at 17 Broadstairs Road in St Peter's. This was designed by Giles Gilbert Scott in 1930. The shrine of Our Lady of Bradstowe now resides in Holy Trinity church Broadstairs, not far from the original chapel.

It connects the inner-west of Sydney with the outer western suburbs. It used to be Metroad 4, which was a Metroad in Sydney. The A4/M4 mostly follows what was previously National Route 32 from the Western Distributor in the CBD, west to the Great Western Highway (Route 32) at Lapstone. Both the A4 and M4 sections were known as Metroad 4 until 2013, which in turn replaced the previous Sydney stretch of National Route 32 in September 1992. The names \\"M4\\" and \\"A4\\" are just the route allocations for the route as a whole. In fact, the A4/M4 route runs along a whole series of roads. The roads from east to west are: * A4 section: ** Western Distributor ** Victoria Road ** The Crescent ** City West Link ** Dobroyd Parade ** Wattle Street * M4 section: ** M4 East ** M4 Western Motorway History The earliest route allocation of M4/A4 is National Route 32. It was introduced in 1954 with other National Routes. Most of the 1954 alignment of National Route 32 in Sydney is very different from the current M4/A4 alignment in Sydney. Back then National Route 32 ran along the entire Great Western Highway from via the Blue Mountains to Broadway, Sydney. With the opening of the M4 Western Motorway in 1992, National Route 32 was truncated and terminated at Lapstone in Blue Mountains instead. Metroad 4 was introduced to replace the Sydney section of National Route 32, but went along the motorway instead of Great Western Highway from to . This was the first Metroad to be introduced in Sydney. The section of Great Western Highway that was formerly National Route 32 was allocated State Route 44 which is now A44. In 2000, when the City West Link opened, Metroad 4 was realigned to Wattle Street, Dobroyd Parade, City West Link, Victoria Road and Western Distributor and terminated at the junction of Cahill Expressway, Western Distributor and Bradfield Highway in .Metroad 4, Ozroads, Retrieved on 8 August 2013. In 2013, as part of the statewide alpha numeric route conversion, the Metroad 4 was replaced by M4 for the motorway and A4 for the non-motorway section. In July 2019, the A4 between Strathfield and Haberfield was realigned onto the new M4 East tunnels and was redesignated M4. This meant that A4 no longer runs along any section of Parramatta Road or Great Western Highway.

He is the great uncle of maternal siblings Residente and ILE of Calle 13, and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Early years Concepci√≥n de Gracia was born in the town of Vega Alta, Puerto Rico to Ceferino Concepci√≥n √Ålvarez and Carmen de Gracia Toro. There he attended Jos√© de Diego elementary school in his hometown of Vega Alta and \\"Central High School\\" in Santurce, a district of San Juan, Puerto Rico. After he graduated from high school, he continued his academic education studies and earned a bachelors and later master's degree in Law and Public Administration from the University of Puerto Rico. He earned a doctorate in Law from George Washington University Law School in Washington, D.C. Career as a lawyer Concepci√≥n de Gracia worked as a lawyer specializing in civil and constitutional law. In 1936, at the age of 25, he moved to New York to represent Pedro Albizu Campos and other members of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, who were jailed and appealing their case. Concepci√≥n de Gracia remained in New York, defending the civil rights of Hispanic workers and other minorities. He became more involved in politics, and particularly the cause of Puerto Rican independence from the United States. He befriended the like-minded congressman Vito Marcantonio, and took the editorship of a newspaper called La Voz (\\"The Voice\\"). Educator Concepci√≥n de Gracia later became a professor of Hispanic literature at Middlebury College in Vermont. He then moved to Washington, D.C. and worked at the Panamerican Union, the organization which would later be known as the Organization of American States. In 1943, while he continued to pursue his Law education, Concepcion de Gracia joined a group called the 'Congress for Independence', which advocated the independence of Puerto Rico. Puerto Rican Independence Party Flag of the Puerto Rican Independence Party On October 20, 1946, the Puerto Rican Independence Party (Partido Independentista Puertorrique√±o, or PIP) was created with Concepci√≥n de Gracia as its president. The PIP was registered as an official political party in 1948 and participated in that year's elections. It became the second-largest party in Puerto Rico in 1952, when it captured 20% of the electoral vote. Fifteen (15) PIP members were elected to the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico that year. Concepcion de Gracia himself joined the Senate of Puerto Rico, and became the speaker for his party, a post which he held until 1960. That year, the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico (PPD) won the governorship and created a political status known as the Associated Free State (Estado Libre Asociado, or ELA). Concepcion de Gracia claimed that the new status was only a deceptive way to hide and continue the colonial relationship with the U.S. On July 25, 1952, Puerto Rico adopted a constitution establishing its status as a commonwealth. Concepci√≥n de Gracia and the PIP considered this status to be just another name for colonialism, and did not participate in the Constitutional Assembly. Puerto Rico before the United Nations Concepci√≥n de Gracia and Julio Pinto Gand√≠a took Puerto Rico's case before the United Nations and sustained that Puerto Ricans should have the right to a consultation before being sent to any war. He also protested the sterilization practices in the U.S. of Puerto Ricans and the passive immigration of Puerto Ricans to the U.S. In 1955 he represented Puerto Rico in a conference held in Bandung, Indonesia sponsored by the United Nations. He also represented the PIP at the 1949 conference of the Organization of American States held in Havana, Cuba, and at the 1957 conference in Maracay, Venezuela. In 1964 he represented the PIP at a United States Congress commission on Puerto Rico's political status. Gilberto Concepci√≥n de Gracia died on March 15, 1968 in Santurce, Puerto Rico. In memory Concepci√≥n de Gracia's name has been attached to many places in Puerto Rico, including the beach on the contested island of Vieques where the PIP established a camp in 1999 during the Navy- Vieques protests. His native town of Vega Alta erected a statue in his honor in the town's square.

It was first produced at the Manitoba Theatre Centre in November 1992. The play is based on the life of Guillaume Le Gentil (1725-1792), a gentleman astronomer. In the play, he is obsessed with observing the transit of Venus. He leaves Celeste, the girl who loves him, to embark on an expedition to observe it. He returns after six years, having failed to observe the transit. He immediately makes preparations for a new expedition to observe the next transit. Some artistic license has been taken: the real-life Guillaume Le Gentil did not return until after the second transit, remaining overseas during the eight-year interim.

BOAC Speedbird in the BOAC logo ca. 1965 Ensign refuelling in Accra during WW2. The speedbird on a BOAC bus With the creation of BOAC in 1939 the logo was retained, continuing to appear on the noses of aircraft throughout World War II despite the military-style camouflage that had replaced the airline livery. From 1950 BOAC gave the Speedbird greater prominence on the aircraft using it on the tail fin, either in navy blue on a white background or vice versa, and also using it widely elsewhere, such as on airport buses. With the advent of air traffic control and the adoption of call signs to identify aircraft and their operators, BOAC chose the name of their now well-known logo, \\"Speedbird\\", as their call sign when in flight. In the mid-1960s the design of the Speedbird was slightly altered, with a slimmer \\"body\\" and larger \\"wing\\", and on the tailfin coloured gold on a navy blue background. Elsewhere the colours used for it were mostly a combination of cyan and white. British Airways Speedbird logo on the nose of Concorde G-BOAD at takeoff In 1974, BOAC was merged with British European Airways and others to form British Airways. The speedbird logo was retained unaltered, but returned to the nose section of the aircraft. A prominent Union Flag design now occupied the fin.

As British Airways prepared for privatisation, a new corporate look was adopted in 1984, developed by Landor Associates. Referred to as the Speedwing, the red flash on the lower dark blue part of the fuselage bore a slight resemblance to the original 1930s design. The current Speedmarque ribbon bears a tangential resemblance to the original Speedbird. \\"Speedbird\\" continues to be used by British Airways as the ICAO callsign for its main international services. On its domestic services, it uses the callsign \\"Shuttle\\". Hatton Cross tube station (open 1975) still has \\"Speedbird\\" decorating its platform pillars. In 2019, the Speedbird emblem returned to use by British Airways with the unveiling of their BOAC-liveried Boeing 747-400 retrojet to celebrate 100 years of BA and its predecessors.

The Speedbird is among his best known works. The minimalist, stylish and avant-garde design representing a bird in flight it is instantly recognisable and has a timelessly modern appeal.David H. T. Scott, Poetics of the Poster: The Rhetoric of Image-text, Liverpool University Press, 2010, Chapter 2. Lee-Elliott was influenced by the avant-garde work of Edward McKnight Kauffer and the logo echoes Kauffer's angular bird forms in his 1918 poster for the Daily Herald. Other notable works by Lee-Elliott include posters for the London Underground and the Airmail logo. Many of his paintings and original artworks are in the collection of the Victoria & Albert Museum.

On the left can be seen the three tower blocks of Stockbridge Village. The M57 motorway, also known as the Liverpool Outer Ring Road, is a road in England. Designed as a Ring road for Liverpool, it is long and links various towns east of the city, as well as the M62 and M58 motorways. Route Starting at the Tarbock Interchange in Tarbock, at the end of the A5300, the motorway heads north to the east of Huyton and west of Prescot and crosses the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. It then runs across the north east of Huyton before running west of Knowsley Village. After meeting the A580 at a split junction (numbered 4 & 5), it continues north west between Fazakerley and Kirkby, passes under the Kirkby and Ormskirk branches of the Merseyrail Northern Line before ending on Switch Island near Aintree. The motorway provides one of the main access routes to Aintree Racecourse.

During this period he served as the first menahel (director) of Ezras Torah from around 1924 until he was succeeded by Rav Henkin around the year 1925. Although Epstein was a bookkeeper by profession, he had been a student at the Volozhin Yeshiva under his uncle Rabbi Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin (who became his brother-in-law after being widowed and remarrying Epstein's sister).

It starts close to the Ribblehead Viaduct in North Yorkshire, and is one of the few that start in the Yorkshire Dales and flow westwards towards the sea (the Dee in Dentdale and the Twiss in Kingsdale being notable others). Etymology The name Ribble may be a Brittonic compound-formation. The second element is the noun *pol, with connotations including \\"puddle, pond, upland-stream\\" (Welsh pwll). The first is r√∂-, an intensive prefix, with nouns meaning \\"great\\" (Welsh rhy-, Cornish re-). Ribble may once have been known as *BremetonƒÅ-, underlying the name Bremetenacum, the Roman fort at Ribchester. Involved here is the Brittonic root *breŒº‚Äì, meaning \\"roaring\\" (c.f. Welsh brefu), as observed at the river-names Breamish in Northumberland, Braan in Scotland and Brefi in Wales. History Neolithic to Saxon finds from along the River Ribble during the creation of the Preston Docks and others revealed man has been in the area for a long time. The River Ribble looked completely different then and the coastline is likely to have been much further inland than it is at present where land has been reclaimed and the marsh extended out into the River Ribble due to sedimentation. The Ribble would appear to have been known in Roman times as the Belisama,Hutton, p. 218 possibly giving its name to Samlesbury. Ptolemy's \\"Belisama aest.\\" seems to represent the estuary of the Ribble. Bremetennacum was a Roman fort that guarded a crossing-point of the river at Ribchester. Remains of another Roman site were discovered at Walton-le-Dale in the mid-19th century. The medieval silver Mitton Hoard was found near where this river joins the River Hodder in 2009.Coin hoard BM-193206, Finds.org.uk, Retrieved 16 September 2015 Whilst the Cuerdale Hoard, the largest Viking silver hoard ever found outside Russia was discovered in 1840 on the southern bank of a bend of the river, at Cuerdale near Preston. At one time the Ribble marked the northernmost extent of the ancient kingdom of Mercia. At the time of the Domesday Book, the river formed the northern boundary of an area of land (known as Inter Ripam et Mersam) that was included in the Domesday information for Cheshire,Morgan (1978); pp. 269c-301c,d. though it was probably not formally part of the county of Cheshire.Harris and Thacker (1987). write on page 252: Phillips and Phillips (2002). pp. 26-31.Crosby, A. (1996). writes on page 31: Geography Ribble estuary The Ribble begins at the confluence of the Gayle Beck and Batty Wife Beck near the viaduct at Ribblehead, in the shadow of the Yorkshire three peaks. It is the only major river rising in Yorkshire which flows westward. It flows through Settle, Clitheroe, Ribchester and Preston, before emptying into the Irish Sea between Lytham St. Annes and Southport, a length of . Its main tributaries are the Hodder and Calder which join the river near Great Mitton, the River Darwen which joins at Walton-le-Dale and the River Douglas which joins near Hesketh Bank. Above Hellifield the valley of the river is known as Ribblesdale. The Ribble Way is a long-distance footpath which follows the river for much of its course. The river is connected to both the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the Lancaster Canal (via the Ribble Link). The river downstream of Preston was actively dredged when Preston was an active port; this is no longer done and silt from the river is now spreading more widely over the (sand) beaches around Fairhaven and St. Annes. Its estuary forms part of the Ribble and Alt Estuaries Special Protection Area for wildlife. An average of 340,000 water birds over-winter in the estuary making it the most important wetland site in Britain. The Ribble is also a key breeding ground for the endangered Atlantic salmon. 1.25 million people live in the Ribble's catchment area. The Normal Tidal Limit (NTL) of the river is at Fishwick Bottoms, between Preston and Walton-le-Dale, from the sea. The River Ribble has the third-largest tides in England, with tides that run at and a tidal range at the mouth of the river of during spring tides. Since River Ribble dredging ceased, the estuary is filling up with sand and is developing a meandering path, depending on the tides and river runoff. In addition, many tributaries flow into the main channel including the Savick Brook/Ribble Link, while the River Douglas, has a significant influence both on sediment transport and hydrodynamics of the estuary. Ribble campaigns The River Ribble catchment is covered by the Ribble Rivers Trust, a UK based charity working to improve, protect and promote the River Ribble for both people and wildlife. Preston City Council have published plans to build a barrage across the River Ribble, in their 'Riverworks' proposals. The aim of these proposals is to build a water sports park on a section of the Ribble, coupled with over 4,000 units of housing and businesses in the river's flood plain. Some local residents are opposing these plans, arguing that they endanger wildlife, increase flood risk to local housing and damage greenbelt areas. These residents have set up the Save The Ribble campaign. Parts of the river are a County Biological Heritage Site.

The character is commonly associated with the X-Men. A Scottish mutant, Wolfsbane possesses the ability to transform into a wolf or into a transitional state somewhere between human and wolf that is similar to a werewolf. She has honed her powers to shift between human and wolf characteristics but must keep her feral instincts at bay when she does. She was initially a member of the X-Men's original junior team The New Mutants. Later on she joined the Pentagon-sponsored X-Factor and was also associated with the British superhero team Excalibur. She appeared for a time as a teacher at Xavier's Academy in New X-Men. She served as a member of the X-Factor Investigations detective agency, until she joined the new incarnation of X-Force. Wolfsbane has made minor appearances in animated television, though the character did make her live-action cinematic debut in the 2020 film The New Mutants, portrayed by Maisie Williams. Publication history Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Bob McLeod, Wolfsbane first appeared in The New Mutants (September 1982), part of the line Marvel Graphic Novel. She starred as a founding member of the New Mutants and features in nearly the entire run of The New Mutants volume 1 (1983-1991), her last issue being #97 in which she decides to stay in Genosha at the end of the X-Tinction Agenda crossover. When the original five X-Men left X-Factor to rejoin the X-Men, Wolfsbane was recruited to join when it became a government operation, in issue #71 (1991), in which she featured as a team member through issue #111 (1995), when the title was interrupted by The Age of Apocalypse. Afterwards, Wolfsbane left X-Factor to visit her foster mother, Moira MacTaggart and joined Excalibur starting with issue #90 (1995) through the title's conclusion with issue #125 (1998). She was a supporting character in the short-lived Warlock comic (1991-2000) featuring the Douglock entity, and then sporadically in The New Mutants volume 2 (2004) and New X-Men (2004-2005). With the relaunch of X-Factor, volume 3 (2006), Wolfsbane once again saw regular publication as a central team member between issues #1 and #28 (2006-2008), after which she was transferred to the secret strike team X-Force, volume 3 (2008). During this run, she became pregnant by the Asgardian Hrimhari, and with X-Force volume 3 #25 (2010), this pregnancy caused her to return to X-Factor, starting with issue #207 (2010). With her return, much of the X-Factor volume 3 run was dedicated to her pregnancy and her son, Tier, and her last significant appearance was X-Factor #258 (2013). Fictional character biography Early life Rahne (pronounced \\"Rain\\") is Scottish (born somewhere in Ross and Cromarty). Rahne was raised as an orphan by an abusive pastor named Reverend Craig who beat religion into her from an early age. When she was revealed as a mutant, Reverend Craig led an angry mob intending to burn her at the stake. Rahne was rescued and later adopted by Moira MacTaggert.Marvel Graphic Novel #4: The New Mutants. Marvel Comics. Later, when she confronts Reverend Craig as an adult, she learned that Reverend Craig was actually her biological father and that her mother had been a prostitute.Excalibur #93. Marvel Comics. She is recruited by Professor X to become a student at his School for Gifted Youngsters, and to join the original New Mutants. New Mutants Rahne was one of the original New Mutants, who often operated as adventurers when not in school. Although she was a shy, emotionally repressed girl, Rahne managed to build a strong friendship with Danielle Moonstar and harbor a crush on Sam Guthrie. Danielle discovered she was able to establish a psychic link with Rahne when the latter was in wolf or wolfoid form. Rahne's strict religious upbringing often made her uncomfortable when dealing with mythological entities, her sorceress teammate Magik, or demons, as well as making her uncomfortable almost to the point of self- loathing with her superhuman power, which resembles the transformations of a werewolf. These feelings were at odds with the pure joy she found in using her powers, causing a deep emotional conflict. She was disturbed to find herself attracted to Hrimhari, a shapeshifting wolf prince, while in Asgard, and although he became her first serious love, she decided to return to Earth.The New Mutants Special Edition #1 and X-Men Annual #9. Marvel Comics. Rahne eventually began a relationship with teammate Cypher,The New Mutants vol. 1 #55. Marvel Comics. and was devastated when he was killed by the Ani-Mator.The New Mutants vol 1 #60. Marvel Comics. On one of her two visits to Asgard, she met the demonic Garmr, a gigantic wolf who guards the entrance to the netherworld. She confesses to Rictor that Garm's face, 'that devil's face', is what she sometimes perceives when looking into the mirror. Later, she begins an innocent romance with Rictor, but this proves to be short-lived. X-Factor During the 1990 \\"X-Tinction Agenda\\" storyline Rahne is mentally bonded to Havok against her will by the scientists who genetically engineer mutant slaves in the nation of Genosha.The New Mutants #96 (December 1990) She is subsequently manipulated by the Shadow King, into her joining X-Factor as a United States government special operative. Her bond with Havok causes her to act irrationally, sometimes threatening teammates, sometimes by flirting with them. She stays in half-wolf forms for this time, because turning completely human causes her to revert to the slave identity that the Genoshans had created for her. She undergoes more than one attempt to undo the bonding, with varying results. Her instability also manifests in many odd dreams, in which her identity is merged into pop culture figures. The Genoshan damage is eventually undone by Haven.X-Factor #99. Marvel Comics. Wolfsbane appears in the 1992 miniseries The Infinity War and its 1993 sequel, The Infinity Crusade. During the first storyline, she is part of the rear guard who stayed behind on Earth at the Fantastic Four headquarters. Various evil doubles attack the building and the assembled heroes.The Infinity War #4. Marvel Comics. During Crusade, Wolfsbane's deep religious beliefs lead her to be approached by the main villain, the Goddess.

Marvel Comics. Excalibur Some time after her mental damage from the Genoshan bonding process was undone, she returned to MacTaggert's base on Muir Island and joined Excalibur.Excalibur #90. Marvel Comics. She matures much in her tenure in the book. She develops deep friendships with her allies, including Peter Rasputin and Kitty Pryde.Excalibur #91 (October 1995). Marvel Comics. She is depicted as having overcome much of her previous shyness, not caring if the general public of a small town saw her in a revealing uniform. Rahne also was a bridesmaid in the wedding of Captain Britain and Meggan. Following the disbanding of Excalibur, she and teammate Douglock stayed on Muir Island to assist Moira in her search for a cure for the Legacy Virus. Rahne appears in many issues of the short-lived comic book series Warlock, which starred Douglock. She helps him and others confront various threats revolving around Douglock's assimilation powers. She assists the Avengers in confronting one of the larger threats that nearly overwhelm the city of New York.

She becomes both a teaching assistant at the Xavier Institute and a part-time employee of Jamie Madrox's detective agency, X-Factor Investigations. Prior to her joining the Institute faculty, Rahne becomes involved in a relationship with Elixir. A passionate encounter between the two caused Elixir's mutant healing abilities to restore Rahne's powers; however, Rahne's reversion to her wolf form prompts a tragic moment of savagery that left Elixir seriously wounded. Elixir is able to heal himself, and Rahne is brought back to her senses by an encounter with Danielle Moonstar on the darkened streets of Salem Center. Rahne opts to end the relationship when she is hired as a teacher for the Institute. Though Rahne is initially resistant to continuing the relationship, the two began seeing one another secretly until Rahne ended it upon learning that Elixir's classmate Wallflower is interested in him. Rahne's ending of the relationship is overheard by Wither, and he later releases the information to the whole school in an attempt to end Elixir's budding relationship with Wallflower. In the wake of this, Rahne resigns from the school, and her formerly close friendship with Dani Moonstar, Elixir's legal guardian, becomes strained. X-Factor Investigations Rahne begins working full-time for X-Factor, reuniting her with former love interest and New Mutants teammate Rictor, now depowered.X-Factor Vol 3 #1 (December 2005).

She is also a member of the new X-Force. During a battle against Lady Deathstrike and the Reavers, Rahne learns that Father Craig was in league with the Purifiers, supposedly divulging enough information about her that the Purifiers can claim to \\"know her well.\\" She travels with X-Force to her former home Muir Island, now the base of the Marauders. During the climactic battle, Rahne is injured by Riptide, but her wounds, according to Professor X, are superficial and she will recover.X-Factor #27 (Jan. 2008). Marvel Comics. X-Force When Cyclops decides to reform X-Force after the events of \\"Messiah Complex\\", he brings Rahne along to meet with Wolverine.

After Reverend Craig tries to kill her, she escapes, but not before admitting that the only thing she wanted was her father's love.X-Force Vol. 3 #5. Marvel Comics. Rahne regroups with her teammates and they begin their assault against Bastion, the Choir, and the Purifiers. As everyone is distracted in the bloody battle, Rahne is shot by her father who follows her blood trail into the room where Angel's severed wings are held. Reverend Craig condemns Wolfsbane again, which triggers her to knock him into the ground, stating that she only wanted to save him but after everything that's happened, she doesn't care for him any longer and walks away, turning her back on him. Craig screams and prepares to shoot his daughter in the back and as he moves, Rahne turns and sees Angel's wings behind her father, giving him the appearance of an angel. Her brainwashing kicks in once again as she mutters \\"kill the angel\\" and she enters a feral state, attacking her father. Her teammates find her at the epilogue of the battle in her human form, praying and surrounded by blood and clothes, but no corpse of her father is found. Her teammates hope that she will never recall the memory of apparently devouring her father which would only trigger a deeper psychological shock.X-Force Vol. 3 #6 (October 2008). Marvel Comics. Following the death of Risman, the team reconvenes at Angel's Aerie to recuperate and plan their next move. Rahne's sleeper programming is still active, and she violently charges Angel when she sees him, provoking him to transform into Archangel in retaliation. X-23 calls in the Stepford Cuckoos to help undo the damage done to Wolfsbane, prevent her from attacking her teammates, and overcome the guilt of her actions.X-Force Vol. 3 #7. Marvel Comics. Before they can erase her memories, they are interrupted, and X-Force is sent on a mission, leaving Rahne alone.X-Force Vol. 3 #8. Marvel Comics. While alone, she notices someone outside; after running away, it is revealed to be Hrimhari, the Wolf Prince from Asgard.X-Force Vol. 3 #10. Marvel Comics. Since then the Cuckoos began searching for her but Cerebra could not detect her, mainly because she was in her wolf form.X-Force Vol. 3 #12. Marvel Comics. She was at Angel's Aerie with Hrimhari, still conflicted over her experience with the Purifiers. Hrimhari states that the gods of Asgard have reunited them for a reason and if they can forgive her, then she can do the same for herself.X-Force Vol. 3 #13. Marvel Comics. After having sex, the two were attacked by a trio of Frost Giants. Hrimhari wanted to fight them off alone but Rahne refused to leave him and stated that she was no longer afraid of what she is. The two managed to defeat the Frost Giants and although seemingly unharmed, Rahne fainted right afterwards.X-Force Vol. 3 #17-19. Marvel Comics. Secret Invasion Rahne is among the several X-Men helping to fight off Skrulls during their invasion of San Francisco; X-Force were tasked with capturing one of the new Super Skrulls, so Beast could study it to find a weakness.Secret Invasion: X-Men #2 (2008). Marvel Comics. Necrosha After Rahne fell unconscious she was brought to Utopia. There it has been revealed by Dr. Nemesis that she is pregnant with the Wolf Prince's child (a child, according to him, that is neither human nor mutant) and the unborn child is threatening her health and her life.X-Force #22. Marvel Comics. The Wolf Prince later made a deal with the Asgardian goddess of the Underworld, Hela. He gave his soul to Hela in exchange that she restore Elixir to life (after she refused to save Rahne and the baby); she promptly did so and they returned to the Asgardian Underworld together, the Wolf Prince's final words being that he would somehow find his way back to Rahne and their unborn child. Elixir then healed Rahne and stated to her that the genetics of the baby are similar to humans but stronger. He further transferred some of the fetus' strength to Rahne so that she would survive the birth of the baby. While on Genosha, he further stated that he believed that her baby will be very strong and that not even a bullet could pierce her skin now, due to her now-different skin and muscle density. Later on, Rahne further demonstrated enhanced strength and senses.X-Force #23-24. Marvel Comics. Return to X-Factor Investigations The character returns on the last panel of X-Factor #207, obviously pregnant, and walks in on Rictor and Shatterstar in an intimate embrace.X-Factor #207. Marvel Comics. In issue #208, she is flabbergasted at first of Rictor being with Shatterstar (just as Rictor is about her being pregnant). After a short moment of confusion, she attacks Shatterstar and throws him through the window, landing on the streets where she claims that Shatterstar must be mind-controlling Rictor. After both are stopped by Longshot, Rictor tells her that he is not mind-controlled, to which she asks how he could be with Shatterstar when he was with her before. Rictor answers that it's complicated and demands from her to tell him whether he is the father of her child. After hesitating to answer and after another demand from Rictor and looking at Shatterstar, Rahne states that she wasn't with anyone but him seven months before and then throws herself into the arms of a bewildered Rictor.X-Factor #208. Marvel Comics. After Madrox asked about whether she wants to cover her body while still in bed, she stated that she will do it to protect his sensibilities and that she has been running around naked so often lately that she had lost her blushes.X-Factor #209. Marvel Comics. Later on, when Rictor (believing himself to be the father) accompanied Rahne to a physician specialized in 'super-types', it was revealed that although the heartbeat could clearly be heard, the ultrasound examination did not show any picture on the screen. The physician, who at first had trouble believing Rictor to be the father, stated that not even ultrasound can get into Rahne's womb and that this seemed to be a kind of protective function, a mystical one rather than biological.X-Factor #210. Marvel Comics. Shatterstar, simultaneously, made the discovery that Hrimhari was the child's father.X-Factor #212. Marvel Comics. By this time, Rictor had already figured out that he wasn't the father due to the child's mystical nature. Layla Miller stated that Rahne hadn't lied to anybody and after Rictor found her again, Rahne revealed that her pregnancy happened a lot faster than a human one due to Hrimhari's and her lupine nature. She also stated that she was still worried that Rictor 'became' gay because she left him and that she wanted to bring him back to 'her team' because she believes that gay people go to Hell, although she does not want that to be true. Rictor reassured her of their friendship and the two reconciled.X-Factor vol. 3 #213. Marvel Comics. Later, as she left the office to go to church, she ran into Shatterstar, who wanted to mark his territory over Rictor and make peace with her. At the church, they encountered a powerful Sin-Eater demon seeking Rahne's child; it fled after a battle, shortly before Feral‚Äîpreviously deceased‚Äîannounced herself to the pair.X-Factor #220. Marvel Comics. Feral is revealed to have arrived as a tether to the world of the living for various canine and feline gods and demons which want Rahne's baby; as more powerful assailants pour in, the pair attempt to regroup at X-Factor headquarters.X-Factor #221.

While this ability is lycanthropy, it is not magical in nature, but instead a complex biological function involving the mutant X-gene. She can change into a humanoid lupine form resembling a werewolf, or become an actual red wolf. In either form, Wolfsbane has enhanced senses of hearing, sight, and smell (similar to those of a wolf's, but also superior to them); animal-like strength, agility, and reflexes; razor-sharp talons and fangs; and bestial instincts. In lupine form she can also see into the infrared and ultraviolet portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, thereby enabling her to perceive heat patterns and to see in the dark. In her lupine form she can also hear sounds and detect scents outside the normal human range. In her transitional form she is less agile than she is as a wolf, but stronger than she is in human form. In her transitional form she can speak, use her forepaws as hands and easily stand erect, and at least some of her senses remain superhumanly acute. Danielle Moonstar's former telepathic talent, which enabled her to communicate with animals, allowed her to communicate with Wolfsbane to a limited degree when she was in her lupine form or \\"transitional\\" humanoid-wolf form; in lupine form Wolfsbane may have more difficulty understanding complex human concepts. Rahne later learned to enter different transitional forms which vary slightly in appearance. In her \\"absolute\\" lupine form, she possesses superhuman strength and durability. She possesses regenerative abilities which allow her to recover from injuries in a few days which would incapacitate a normal human for weeks or months. Wolfsbane's human form is normal in appearance, originally with the exception that her hair never grew more than a few centimeters long; this limitation has since been removed by a temporary biological change into a \\"mutate\\" by the Genengineer on the island of Genosha during the X-Tinction Agenda storyline. The artificial mutation process Wolfsbane underwent caused her to act with animalistic savagery in her lupine and \\"absolute\\" forms. Rahne was shown to exhibit her keen sense of smell while in human form,X-Factor #11. Marvel Comics. sensing traces of blood and spittle on teammate Strong Guy's hand, (identifying who the fluids belonged to) despite him having already wiped it clean. This was followed by Siryn's sonic-scream, leaving Wolfsbane's \\"doggy-ears...ringing for a week\\" implying her hearing is also enhanced in human form. Rahne mentions to Rictor that she indeed has her wolf senses in her human form but changed the subject before explaining further.X-Factor vol. 3 #17. Marvel Comics. While a member of the second X-Factor team, Rahne wears a special uniform made of \\"unstable molecules\\" that converts to a collar in her non-human forms. After her teammate Elixir alters her DNA to match that of her unborn child's strength, Rahne demonstrates greatly increased superhuman strength. Elixir also believes her skin to have become bulletproof, which she later corroborates. Her senses are further heightened to the point that she is able to smell a missing teammate nearly a mile away and underground. After giving birth to her child, these extra abilities fade, and she has returns to her original levels of strength and durability. Other versions In the alternate timeline of the 1995‚Äì1996 \\"Age of Apocalypse\\" storyline, Rahne finds herself stuck in her lupine form and is a companion to the Dark Beast. When this reality was revisited ten years later in X-Men: Age of Apocalypse, Rahne has been rescued and has begun to rediscover of her humanity again. She is now capable of shifting into her hybrid form but is still very feral in her mindset. An alternate future version of Rahne from the timeline originated by the 1981 \\"Days of Future Past\\" storyline appears in Excalibur #94. She spends much of her time viewing recorded images of death and destruction. She, along with a few surviving friends, participates in a raid on a Black Air facility. An alternate reality version of Rahne, named Princess Rain, appeared prominently in the 1991 graphic novel Wolverine: Rahne of Terra. Wolfsbane was transported to the magic-based world of Gesham by the \\"Mage\\" (Cable's counterpart) in exchange for the Princess Rain, her own counterpart, and brainwashed to make her believe herself to be Rain. This was done in an attempt to save the Princess from a prophecy which apparently said the Princess would die on her sixteenth birthday. Wolverine was taken there by the wizard Magnus (Gesham's version of Magneto), who Magnus attempted to mind-control in an attempt to fulfill the prophecy. While there, Rahne encountered counterparts of most of the New Mutants, hallucinating that they were the versions she knew, and gradually remembering who she actually was. Meanwhile, Wolverine killed Magnus at the climax before they both return home.David, Peter (w), Kubert, Andy (a). Wolverine: Rahne of Terra (1991). Marvel Comics. In the 1995 sequel, Wolverine: Knight of Terra, Wolfsbane and Wolverine helped Queen Rain accept the \\"Beast\\" which gave her shapeshifting powers, as she was the only one who could control it (since she had rejected it, it had possessed someone else, transforming them into a version of Sabretooth). In this volume, the Queen's associates were counterparts to the X-Men, with the role of the Mage being taken by Professor X's counterpart, the Shaman.Wolverine: Knight of Terra (1995). Marvel Comics. In the alternate reality of the 1998‚Äì2001 series Mutant X, Rahne works alongside many of her New Mutant counterparts, making a living as thieves, living in the sewers and calling themselves \\"Marauders.\\" She and her friends barely survive a mission in which they steal container that unbeknownst to them, contains Dracula.Mutant X #26‚Äì27 (December 2000). Marvel Comics. In the alternate reality seen in the 2011 \\"Age of X\\" storyline, Wolfsbane is briefly sheltered from the government by the Fantastic Four, but her presence is betrayed by the Invisible Woman after she accidentally attacks Franklin Richards, resulting in all of the team but Invisible Woman being arrested. An alternate universe version of Rahne, along with alternates of her X-Factor teammates, appears in issue #3 of Mys-Tech Wars to fight alongside the Earth-616 heroes. She does not survive through the violence that follows.Mys-Tech Wars #3 (1993). Marvel Comics. Wolfsbane makes cameo appearances in Ultimate X-Men. She is seen on a viewscreen in her human form and receives passing mention in Ultimate X-Men #43, during the selection process for Emma Frost's Academy of Tomorrow, in which the President of the United States says, \\"No to the wolf girl.\\" In issue #50 she is seen in her hybrid form at a Coney Island freak show. In issue #95, however, it is revealed that the Ultimate Alpha Flight member Sasquatch (who first appeared in issue #94) is in fact Rahne Sinclair, making it her first official named appearance. She and the rest of her team use a power enhancing drug known as Banshee, the Ultimate version of Mutant Growth Hormone, which can induce a secondary mutation, or further an existing mutation, for example turning Angel into a large anthropomorphic eagle. While using the drug, Rahne can still revert to a more human appearance. Later in the same issue, she is injured by Nightcrawler, who, while trying to teleport her away, severs half of her right arm.Ultimate X-Men #95. Marvel Comics. In the alternate future of the 2004-2006 X-Men: The End storyline, Wolfsbane is one of the staff at the X-Mansion. She makes brief telepathic contact with the long-lost Danielle. When Skrulls impersonating old X-Men enemies attack the mansion, Wolfsbane sacrifices herself to save many of the surviving children.X-Men: The End Marvel Comics. Rahne appears in the What If? story \\"What If the X-Men Died on their First Mission?\\" Yet a preteen in this incarnation, she joins Moira McTaggert on a journey to look after Moira's old lover, Charles Xavier, following another severe punishment at the hands of Reverend Craig. Meeting Hank McCoy, they learn from him about the X-Men's secret and their deaths on Krakoa, during the events of the 1975 book Giant-Size X-Men #1. They remain at the Xavier institute to look after the Professor, who has grown despondent over the loss of his students. When Count Nefaria and his Ani-Men later attempt to blackmail the United States government, Beast hastily assembles a mutant hero team to engage them, but Rahne is accidentally taken along as well. When Beast's team is brought into dire straits by the Ani-Men, Xavier telepathically awakens Rahne's latent shapechanging potential, which allows her to rescue her friends. Afterwards, Rahne joins the newly formed X-Men as a \\"charter member\\", although she is last seen wearing her own personal costume.What If vol. 2 #9 (1990). Marvel Comics. In \\"What if Some of the X-Men Had Stayed in Asgard?\\", Wolfsbane's actions diverge from those she committed at the end of The Uncanny X-Men Annual #9 (1985), deciding that she cannot be separated from Hrimhari. Although Hrimhari later dies in battle, he leaves her with three children (depicted as a wolf cub, a human baby and a wolf-human hybrid baby) and the rulership over his wolf people.What If? vol. 2 #12.

However, even if there is only one tax bracket, or one remains within the same tax bracket, there will still be bracket creep resulting in a higher proportion of income being paid in tax. That is, although the marginal tax rate remains unchanged with inflation, the average tax rate will increase. Most progressive tax systems are not adjusted for inflation. As wages and salaries rise in nominal terms under the influence of inflation they become more highly taxed, even though in real terms the value of the wages and salaries has not increased at all. The net effect is that in real terms taxes rise unless the tax rates or brackets are adjusted to compensate. Examples Suppose a person earns $20,000 per year and is liable to 20% tax on earnings above a threshold of $5,000 per year. Then they pay ($20,000‚Äì$5,000)*0.2 = $3,000 in taxes, or 15% of their income. Now suppose that due to inflation, their wage goes up by 5%, but the government only increases the tax threshold by 2%. They must now pay ($21,000‚Äì$5,100)*0.2 = $3,180 or 15.14% of their income as tax. Thus the proportion of the person's income that is paid as tax has increased. Note that in this example, the average tax rate went up even though the tax payer remained in the 20% tax bracket. That is, the marginal tax rate did not change. The Alternative Minimum Tax originally (1971) targeted 155 high-income households; based on 2004 law, it would affect 20% of households by 2010. Political dimension Nominal bracket creep can easily be countered by a system of index-linked tax brackets, but this may be politically undesirable. Many voters do not perceive the effects of bracket creep, and so the government may prefer to adjust tax brackets manually once every few years: in effect, restoring the real tax rates to their approximate pre-inflation levels but in a way that gives the government the appearance that they are cutting taxes. Not surprisingly, such changes are usually made right before a general election is to be held.

The plant and the fruit resemble the blackberry more than the raspberry, but the fruit color is a dark red, rather than black as in blackberries. Loganberries - which were an accident of berry breeding by James Harvey Logan, for whom they are named - are cultivated commercially and by gardeners.  Origin  The loganberry was derived from a cross between Rubus ursinus (R. vitifolius) 'Aughinbaugh' (octaploid) as the female parent and Rubus idaeus 'Red Antwerp' (diploid) as the male parent (pollen source); the loganberry is hexaploid. It was accidentally created in 1881 in Santa Cruz, California, by the American judge and horticulturist James Harvey Logan (1841‚Äì1928).www.britannica.com Logan was unsatisfied with the existing varieties of blackberries and tried crossing two varieties of blackberries to produce a superior cultivar. He happened to plant them next to plants of an old variety of red raspberry, 'Red Antwerp', all of which flowered and fruited together. The two blackberry cultivars involved in these experiments were probably 'Aughinbaugh' and 'Texas Early' (a cultivar of Rubus velox), which were two of the three varieties that Logan had planted in his yard that year. Logan then gathered and planted the seed from his cross-bred plants. His 50 seedlings produced plants similar to the blackberry parent 'Aughinbaugh', but larger and more vigorous. One was the loganberry; the others included the 'Mammoth' blackberry.J. H. Logan: \\"The Loganberry and the Mammoth blackberry are the only plants of any value that I have originated\\" in E. J. Wickson, \\"Notes on California Plant Breeding\\", Memoirs of the Horticultural Society of New York (1902). Since Logan's time, crosses between the cultivars of raspberry and blackberry have confirmed the loganberry's parentage, with an earlier theory that the loganberry originated as a red-fruiting form of the common Californian blackberry Rubus ursinus now disproved.Anderson, E. 1952. Plants, man, and life. Little, Brown and Company, Boston page 56 Progeny from Logan's original plant was introduced to Europe in 1897. A prickle-free mutation of the loganberry, the 'American Thornless', was developed in 1933. The tayberry is a similar raspberry-blackberry hybrid. The 'Phenomenal' berry or 'Burbank's Logan', developed by Luther Burbank in 1905, is also a raspberry-blackberry hybrid, but is a second-generation cross (i.e., two first-generation crosses between blackberry and raspberry were then crossed to each other). Other similar hybrids include the nessberry, which is a cross between a dewberry and a red raspberry, and youngberry, a three-way cross between blackberry, raspberry, and dewberry. The loganberry has been used as a parent in more recent crosses between various Rubus species, such as boysenberry (Loganberry √ó raspberry √ó blackberry), the Santiam blackberry (loganberry √ó California blackberry [R. ursinus]), and the olallieberry (Black Logan √ó youngberry). The loganberry is part of the ancestral line leading to the Marionberry, a common and popular berry grown mainly in Oregon.

Due to its high vitamin C content, the loganberry was used by the British navy at the beginning of the 20th century as a source of vitamin C to prevent sailors from getting scurvy, in much the same way as the British did with limes during the late 18th century (hence the American term for the British, \\"limey\\"). During this period at the beginning of the 20th century, the largest proportion of loganberries grown for the British navy (roughly 1/3) were grown on a single farm in Leigh Sinton, near Malvern in Worcestershire, England, run by the Norbury family.  Cultivation  Loganberries in blossom Ripening loganberries Loganberry plants are sturdy and more disease- and frost- resistant than many other berries. However, they are not very popular with commercial growers due to several problems which increase labor costs, since the plants tend to be thorny and the berries are often hidden by the leaves. Additionally, berries of varying maturity may grow on a single plant, making it difficult to completely harvest each plant. Loganberries are therefore more commonly grown in household gardens. A loganberry bush usually produces about ten canes (vines). The canes are not as upright as its raspberry parent, and tend instead to vine more like its blackberry parent. Growth can be undisciplined, with the canes growing five or more feet in a year. Some gardeners train the canes fanwise along a wall or a wire frame. Old canes die after their second year, and should be cut away as they can become diseased, and also hinder harvesting. The loganberry fruits earlier than its blackberry parent. Fruit is produced for about two months, generally from midsummer until mid-autumn, with a plant at a given time mid-season bearing fruit in different stages, from blossom to maturity. The berries are generally harvested when they are a deep purple color, rather than red. Each bush can produce 7 kg to 8 kg (15 lb to 18 lb) of fruit a year. Plants continue to fruit for around 15 years, and can also self-propagate. The cultivars 'Ly 59' and 'Ly 654' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.  Uses  Loganberries are consumed fresh, or used for juice or in jams, pies, crumbles, fruit syrups, and country wines. In the UK, fresh or canned (tinned) loganberries are often paired with English Sherry trifle, or their juice (or syrup) paired with the sherry. Loganberry is a popular beverage flavoring in Western New York and parts of Southern Ontario, beginning there as a drink sold at Crystal Beach Park in Crystal Beach, Ontario. Even though the park has long been closed down, several companies still sell varieties of loganberry drinks through stores throughout the area, which are sold at several local fast-food franchises such as Mighty Taco in Buffalo, Sport of Kings Restaurant in Batavia, New York as well as at supermarkets. There are also milkshakes flavored with loganberry syrup.

It may also attempt to recreate conditions of pre-European arrival, for example by simulating endogenous disturbances such as fire. Bush regeneration attempts to protect and enhance the floral biodiversity in an area by providing conditions conducive to the recruitment and survival of native plants. Bushcare's Major Day Out is an Australian national day of community participation in the care of bushland. In 2012 nearly 100 bushcare sites participated in this annual event. For more information go to www.bushcaresmajordayout.org. History Bradley method In the early 1960s Joan and Eileen Bradleyhttp://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bradley-eileen-burton-9566 developed a series of weed control techniques through a process of trial and error. Their work was the beginning of minimal disturbance bush regeneration in New South Wales. The Bradley method urges a naturalistic approach by encouraging the native vegetation to self-reestablish. The Bradleys used their method to successfully clear weeds from a reserve in Ashton Park, part of Sydney Harbour National Park, NSW. The process demonstrated that, following a period of consecutive 'follow up' treatments of diminishing time requirement, subsequent maintenance was needed only once or twice a year, mainly in vulnerable spots such as creek banks, roadsides, and clearings, to be maintained weed-free. The aim of their work was to clear small niches adjacent to healthy native vegetation such that the each area will regenerate from in-situ soil seed banks or be re-colonised and stabilised by the regeneration of native plants, replacing an area previously occupied by weeds. The Bradley method follows three main principles, #secure the best areas first #minimise disturbance to the natural conditions (e.g. minimise soil disturbance and off-target damage). #don't overclear, let the regenerative ability of the bush set the pace of clearance (Bradley 1988). The priority securing of the best quality vegetation aids in preserving areas of top biodiversity which provide regeneration potential to expand these areas and reclaim areas as bushland. Modern practice The adoption of minimal disturbance bush regeneration increased in the decades that followed the work of the Bradleys. Their principles have guided bushcare programs in Australia, although the inclusion of herbicide in modern bush regeneration is a notable deviation from the ideals of the Bradley sisters. In addition, rather than 'minimal disturbance', a more favoured and ecologically sound trend since the 1990s has been towards more 'appropriate disturbance' as many Australian plant communities require some level of perturbation to trigger germination from long-buried seed banks. This has led to a range of additional disturbance-based techniques (such as burns and soil disturbance) being included in the regenerator's 'tool kit' in dry forest and grassland areas. Field experience has found that, even in rainforest areas, a resilience to disturbance is evident, enabling regenerators to clear weed in a fairly extensive manner to trigger rainforest recovery. This is borne out by a thriving rainforest regeneration industry in northern NSW Australia, modelled on the pioneering work of John Stockard at Wingham Brush (Stockard 1991, Stockard 1999).http://www.aabr.org.au/the-regeneration-of-wingham-brush-nsw/ The rule of thumb in all cases is to constrain clearing to that area that matches the project's follow up resources. The increased awareness and consideration of Australia's biodiversity by citizens has incrementally increased pressure on local governments to adopt conservation programs for remnant vegetation on council land. Most peri urban councils now have some involvement in bush regeneration, either through planning, land management, volunteer support or through employment of bush regeneration practitioners. In NSW the level of coordination of bush regeneration programs through local governments is high, although in some other areas at present a lack of coordination is a serious concern in bush regeneration on public land, with only 40% of councils liaising with other councils. In such areas there may be a need for strategic management at a regional scale through Natural Resource Management Boards or non government organisations such as Trees For Life, which are involved in bushcare programs across wider areas. Purposes The aim of bush regeneration, also known as 'natural area restoration', is to restore and maintain ecosystem health by facilitating the natural regeneration of indigenous flora, this is usually achieved by selectively reducing the competitive interaction with invasive species, or mitigation of negative influences such as weeds or erosion. See also Albert Morris. Invasive plant species are often the greatest threat to remnant vegetation, and therefore bush regeneration is closely associated with weed abatement activities. Weed management as one aim of bush regeneration, is used to increase native plant recruitment. The management of factors such as fire and herbivory can be just as important, depending on the ecosystem being restored. In recent years research and on-ground management has begun to recognize the importance of ecosystem processes rather ecosystem composition and structure and research into other ways of facilitating native plant recruitment is increasing. Technique The original Bradley method of bush regeneration focuses on facilitating native plant recruitment from the seedbank, rather than planting seedlings or sowing seeds, as follows: > \\"Weeding a little at a time from the bush towards the weeds takes the > pressure off the natives under favourable conditions. Native seeds and > spores are ready in the ground and the natural environment favours plants > that have evolved in it. The balance is tipped back towards regeneration. > Keep it that way, by always working where the strongest area of bush meets > the weakest weeds\\" . Currently the term 'bush regeneration' includes activities other than weed removal, such as replanting and introducing species into an area where soil, water, or fire regimes have shifted the type of plant appropriate to the area (e.g. a stormwater drain). Weed species can be important habitat for native fauna (e.g. blackberry is important habitat for wrens and the southern brown bandicoot) and this should be taken into consideration with bush regeneration, for example by not clearing invasive species until adequate habitat alternatives have been established nearby with native vegetation. Problems can occur when insufficient follow-up is conducted as the success of bush regeneration is dependent on allowing the native vegetation to regenerate in the area where weeds have been removed.

It can be considered both as a forerunner of, and a challenge to, the rather better known concept of Max Weber‚Äôs: the ideal type (in German Idealtyp).C. Schl√ºter/L. Clausen eds., Renaissance der Gemeinschaft? (1990) p. 135 T√∂nnies‚Äô distinctions T√∂nnies drew a sharp line between the realm of conceptualization (of sociological terms, including ‚Äònormal types‚Äô) and the realm of reality (of social action). The first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way (pure sociology); the second, empirically and in an inductive way (applied sociology). Following T√∂nnies, reality (the second realm) cannot be explained without concepts, which belong to the first realm, or else you will fail because you try to define x by something derived from x. T√∂nnies‚Äô Normaltyp was thus a conceptual tool created on a logical basis,P. Muljadi ed. Community (nd) p. 11 an almost mathematical concept always open to subsequent refinement from a confrontation with the empirical evidence.W.J. Cahnman et al. Weber and Toennies (1943) pp. 69, 128 The contrast with Weber‚Äôs ‚Äòideal type‚Äô came from the latter‚Äôs ‚Äòaccentuation‚Äô of certain elements of a real social process, which is under sociological (or historical) scrutiny - ‚Äúthe one-sided accentuation of one or more points of view ... of a great many diffuse, discrete, more or less present and occasionally absent concrete individual phenomena‚Äù, as Weber himself put it.Quoted in Alfred Schutz, The Phenomenology of the Social World (1997) p. 243 From T√∂nnies‚Äô point of view, an ideal type cannot explain reality, because it is derived from reality by accentuation, but might help to understand reality. The normal type moved from abstract to concrete; the ideal type from concrete to abstract. Weber's survival Nevertheless, Weber‚Äôs term survived in the sociological community, since his Idealtyp helped to understand social forces, and for him sociology had both to explain and to understand things - a daring combination, but successful in the eyes of many sociologists.

Biography Sullivan was born in Omaha, Nebraska. His father, J. B. Sullivan, moved the family to Douglas, Wyoming, to open a law practice. Mike Sullivan graduated from Douglas High School as the class salutatorian. He continued his education at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, where he earned a bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering and then a law degree. On September 2, 1961, Sullivan married Jane Metzler of Riverton in ceremonies in Powell. They made their home in Casper. Sullivan practiced law with the firm of Brown, Drew, Apostolos, Massey, and Sullivan for twenty years. Sullivan had never sought elective office when, in 1986, he ran for and won the Democratic nomination for governor. Many observers believed that, following three terms with a Democratic governor (Ed Herschler) the chances for another Democrat to gain that post would be remote. Nonetheless, after a hard-fought campaign, Sullivan defeated Republican nominee Peter K. Simpson. In his 1990 reelection, Sullivan defeated the rancher and businesswoman Mary Mead of Jackson, daughter of Republican former Governor and U.S. Senator Clifford P. Hansen. Sullivan received 104,638 votes (65.4 percent) to her 55,471 ballots (34.6 percent). Sullivan tapped the journalist Dennis E. Curran, a native of Wisconsin, to serve from 1987 to 1994 as his press secretary, after which time Curran launched the Wyoming Business Report. He named a Republican, Joseph B. Meyer, as attorney general. Sullivan ran for the U.S. Senate in 1994, but lost 59-39 percent to Representative Craig L. Thomas during the national Republican wave of 1994. Four years after his governorship ended, Sullivan was appointed as United States Ambassador to Ireland by President Bill Clinton, a post he held from 1999 to 2001.Wyoming State Archives official gubernatorial biography His official gubernatorial portrait was painted by artist Michele Rushworth and unveiled in the state capitol by Governor Dave Freudenthal in 2008.

Both of them became independent institutions. However the SBU keeps under control special operation units Alpha with bases in every Ukrainian province. According to British political expert Taras Kuzio the organizational structure of SBU remains to be as bloated in size as the Soviet Ukrainian KGB because the total number of active officers as high as 30,000.

Victory and defeat of the last century, Radio Svoboda (14 January 2018) This was a much more effective agency than its predecessor due to the incorporation of former employees of Okhrana (the secret police force of the Russian Empire). After the fall of the Ukrainian State and the return of power of the Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR) in December 1918, the new UNR authorities destroyed virtually all of the state infrastructure of the Ukrainian State. Therefore, the new secret services founded in January 1919 (with two divisions - domestic and foreign) had to start practically from scratch. \\"Invisible Front\\": Special Forces of the Times of the Ukrainian Revolution, m.dt.ua (November 26, 2018) It never became as well lead, nor successful, as the security services of the Ukrainian State. The security services of the West Ukrainian People's Republic on the other hand were well- organized. The West Ukrainian People's Republic were formed in March 1919 as the Field Gendarmerie of the Ukrainian Galician Army (it also served as military police). There was no cooperation between the West Ukrainian People's Republic and Ukrainian People's Republic security services. In 1924 former (April‚ÄìJuly 1919) head of intelligence of the Ukrainian People's Republic Mykola Chebotarov started intelligence work on his own initiative for the Ukrainian People's Republic government in exile on the territory of the Ukrainian SSR. Soviet era The All-Ukrainian Cheka was formed on December 3, 1918 in Kursk on the initiative from Yakov Sverdlov and Lenin's orders. The commission was formed on the decree of the Provisional Workers' Peasant Government of the Ukrainian SSR and later adopted on May 30, 1919 by the All Ukrainian Central Executive Committee. To support the Soviet government in Ukraine in Moscow was formed a corps of special assignment with 24,500 soldiers as part of the All-Ukrainian Cheka. In spring 1919 there was created the Council in fight against counterrevolution and consisted of Adolph Joffe, Stanislav Kosior, and Martin Latsis. In its early years the security agency fought against the \\"kulak-nationalistic banditry\\" (peasants who resisted having their land confiscated and being forced into collective farms). On August 19, 1920 the All Ukrainian Cheka arrested all members of the All Ukrainian Conference of Mensheviks after accusing them in counterrevolution. On December 10, 1934 the State Political Directorate of Ukraine was dissolved, becoming part of the NKVD of Ukraine. 1990s‚Äì2005 SSU Headquarters in Kyiv The SBU is a successor of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic's Branch of the Soviet KGB, keeping the majority of its 1990s personnel. Many of whom came from the KGB's 5th directorate. It was created in September 1991 following the August 1991 independence of Ukraine. The last Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic's Branch head Colonel-General Nikolai Golushko stayed on as chairman of the newly formed Security Service of Ukraine for four months before moving to Russia. (Golushko headed the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service in Golushko in 1993 and 1994.) Since 1992, the agency has been competing in intelligence functions with the intelligence branch of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. Despite this, a former Military Intelligence Chief and career GRU technological espionage expert, Ihor Smeshko, served as an SBU chief until 2005. According to Taras Kuzio during the 1990s in some regions of Ukraine (Donetsk) the SBU teamed up with local criminals taking part in privatization of state property (so-called prykhvatizatsiya) ignoring its operational objectives and sky-rocketing level of local violence. A notorious incident took place in December 1995 in Western Ukraine when a local citizen Yuriy Mozola was arrested by SBU agents, interrogated and brutally tortured for three days. He refused to confess in trumped up murder charges and died in SBU custody. Later it turned out that the real killer was Anatoly Onoprienko. He was arrested the next year. Reports of SBU involvement in arms sales abroad began appearing regularly in the early 2000s. Ukrainian authorities have acknowledged these sales and arrested some alleged participants. In 2004, the SBU's Intelligence Department was reorganized into an independent agency called Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. It is responsible for all kinds of intelligence as well as for external security. As of 2004, the exact functions of the new service, and respective responsibilities of the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine were not regulated yet. On November 7, 2005 the President of Ukraine created the Ukraine State Service of special communications and protection of information, also known as Derzhspetszvyazok (StateSpecCom) in place of one of the departments of SBU and making it an autonomous agency. The SBU subsumed the Directorate of State Protection of Ukraine (), the personal protection agency for the most senior government officials, which was the former Ninth Directorate of the Ukrainian KGB. The SBU's State Directorate of Personal Protection is known for its former Major Mykola Mel'nychenko, the communications protection agent in President Leonid Kuchma's bodyguard team. Mel'nychenko was the central figure of the Cassette Scandal (2000)‚Äîone of the main events in Ukraine's post-independence history. SBU became involved in the case when Mel'nychenko accused Leonid Derkach, SBU Chief at the time, of several crimes, e.g., of clandestine relations with Russian mafia leader Semyon Mogilevich. However, the UDO was subsumed into the SBU after the scandal, so Mel'nychenko himself has never been an SBU agent. Later, the SBU played a significant role in the investigation of the Georgiy Gongadze murder case, the crime that caused the Cassette Scandal itself. In 2004, General Valeriy Kravchenko, SBU's intelligence representative in Germany, publicly accused his agency of political involvement, including overseas spying on Ukrainian opposition politicians and German TV journalists. He was fired without returning home. After a half-year of hiding in Germany, Kravchenko returned to Ukraine and surrendered in October 2004 (an investigation is underway). Later, the agency commanders became involved in the scandal around the poisoning of Viktor Yushchenko‚Äîa main candidate in the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election. Yushchenko felt unwell soon after supper with SBU Chief Ihor Smeshko, at the home of Smeshko's first deputy. However, neither the politician himself nor the investigators have ever directly accused these officers. It is also important to note that the Personal Protection department has been officially responsible for Yushchenko's personal security since he became a candidate. During the Orange Revolution, several SBU veterans and cadets publicly supported him as president-elect, while the agency as a whole remained neutral. 2005‚Äì2010 In 2005, soon after the elections, sacked SBU Chief Smeshko and other intelligence agents stated their own version of the revolution's events. They claimed to have prevented militsiya from violently suppressing the protests, contradicting the orders of President Kuchma and threatening militsiya with armed involvement of SBU's special forces units. This story was first described by the American journalist C.J. Chivers of The New York Times and has never been supported with documents or legally. The SBU is widely suspected of illegal surveillance and eavesdropping of offices and phones. An episode of human rights abuse by SBU happened during the case of serial killer Anatoly Onoprienko. Yuriy Mozola, an initial suspect in the investigation, died in SBU custody in Lviv as a result of torture. Several agents were convicted in the case. The SBU remains a political controversial subject in Ukrainian politics. 2010‚Äì2014 The former Security Service of Ukraine Head Valeriy Khoroshkovsky was involved in several controversies during his tenure. The rector of the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv Borys Gudziak heavily criticized a visit from the SBU, forcing Khoroshkovskiy to apologize. Later the head of the Kyiv Bureau of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, Nico Lange, was detained for a short while and released only after several high-ranking officials from the German Chancellery vouched for him. The Security Service described the incident as a misunderstanding.Cicero. Berlin. August 2019 p. 38 (in german) Khoroshkovskiy, as the Chairman of the SBU, eliminated the main competition of Ukrainian TV- giant Inter, officially owned by his wife Olena Khoroshkovskiy, in the face of TVi and Channel 5. In July 2010, Konrad Schuller of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote that Khoroshkovskiy had connections with RosUkrEnergo. The most important source of Khoroshkovskiy's came from RosUkrEnergo. The President's spokesperson, Hanna Herman, in an interview with this newspaper, did not dispute that Dmytro Firtash was one of the sponsors of the Presidential Party of Regions, with the help of which Khoroshkovskiy was appointed to the position of the State Security chairman. Khoroshkovskiy denied any connections to RosUkrEnergo. However it is a fact that Firtash possesses certain privileges in Inter. Schuller also stated that the SBU acts in direct association with RosUkrEnergo, arresting their main opponents (see RosUkrEnergo) in order to recover their invested money in the recent presidential campaign. Khoroshkovskiy having declined to give an interview to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Schuller posted a quote from one of his other interviews: When Minister of Finance Fedir Yaroshenko resigned on January 18, 2012, Khoroshkovsky replaced him in the post on the same day. Khoroshkovsky is also the owner of U.A. Inter Media Group which owns major shares in various Ukrainian TV channels including Inter TV. 238 members of the Verkhovna Rada voted for Khoroshkovsky, however the head of the parliamentary committee for the National Security and Defense Anatoliy Hrytsenko stated that the committee accepted the decision to recommend Verkhovna Rada to deny the candidature of Khoroshkovskiy on the post of the chairman of Security Service of Ukraine. Khoroshkovskiy said the SBU's main duty was to protect the president rather than the interests of Ukraine. On July 26, 2010 it arrested an internet blogger, producing a warrant for his arrest the next day. SBU accused the blogger of threatening the President of Ukraine, citing his comment \\"May thunder strike Yanukovych!\\"; he was released after a short discussion. However, SBU showed a rather passive reaction to the statements of the Russian state official who claimed that Crimea and Sevastopol belong to the Russian Federation. Protest group FEMEN said that after the early 2010 election of President Viktor Yanukovych the SBU attempted to intimidate the FEMEN activists. On May 22, 2012 Volodymyr Rokytskyi, Deputy Head of the SBU, was photographed in public wearing a $32,000 luxury wristwatch despite the fact that its price amounts to his yearly official income.

After the overthrow of Yanukovich in the February 2014 Ukrainian revolution the new SBU head Valentyn Nalyvaichenko claimed to have found his new office building empty, saying \\"the agency‚Äôs former leadership had all fled to Russia or Crimea. There were no operative files, no weapons. Institutionally, the place was totally destroyed\\".Ex-Ukrainian Spy Chief: Russian Camps Spreading Chaos, Voice of America (26 July 2015) Nalyvaichenko also claimed that at that time the agency was heavily infiltrated by Russian spies. Indeed, Nalyvaichenko predecessor Oleksandr Yakymenko with about 15 former SBU top officials surfaced in Russia a few days later. Allegedly in the months following the 2014 Ukrainian revolution thousands of Ukrainian spies switched sides and began reporting to Russia during the 2014 Crimean crisis and the pro-Russian unrest in east and south Ukraine. At the end of 2014 235 SBU agents, including the former counterintelligence chief and his cousin, and hundreds of other operatives had been arrested and 25 high treason probes against Yanukovych-era SBU officials had been launched; also all regional directors had been changed, as well as half of their deputies. In July 2015 Nalyvaichenko claimed ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no longer a total infiltration of Russian agents. The danger is no longer widespread‚Äù. The arrested agents were replaced by new recruits from western Ukraine, many of them in their early twenties. To test loyalty, all SBU agents are subjected to recurrent interrogations and lie detector tests. In June 2015, the Kyiv Post reported that a deputy chief of the SBU, Vitaly Malikov, had supported events leading to the annexation of Crimea. According to February 2016 official figures of the Ukrainian parliamentary Committee on National Security, after Russia's annexation 10% of SBU personnel left Crimea. After the annexation left only 10% of staff SBU , Ukrayinska Pravda (8 February 2016) According to the SBU itself (in November 2017) 13% did so. After the annexation, only 217 SBU officers went to the mainland , Ukrayinska Pravda (7 November 2017) In December 21, 2017, two Ukrainian civil servants were arrested by the SBU for spying on behalf of Russia, one of them being an SBU employee while the other, Stanislav Yezhov, worked for various cabinet ministers. In late 2018, the SBU carries out raids across the country targeting the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) churches and priests. On July 8, 2019, the SBU announced that they conducted a raid into Donbass to apprehend Vladimir Borysovich Tsemakh, who was head of the air defense in Snizhne and a 'person of interest' when a Buk missile launcher was used to shoot down MH17. The SBU mentioned that he's a witness to the incident. On April 14, 2020, the SBU announced the arrest of Lt. General Valeriy Shaytanov, who was recruited in 2014 by the FSB during a Russian- Ukrainian anti-terrorist working group under the command of Colonel Igor Egorov. He was known to head the anti-terrorist division who had played a prominent role in negotiating ceasefires and prisoner exchanges with Russia- backed militants in Eastern Ukraine. He had planned the future assassination of Adam Osmayev, a Chechen in the International Peacekeeping Battalion named after Dzhokhar Dudayev which is defending Ukraine against Russia aggression.

It can be verbal (speech patterns, physical activity while speaking, or the tone of voice of an individual) or it can be nonverbal (facial expressions and body language). Some psychologists instead use the term honest signals because such cues are involuntary behaviors that often convey emotion whereas body language can be controlled. Many decisions are based on unconscious communication, which is interpreted and created in the right hemisphere of the brain. The right hemisphere is dominant in perceiving and expressing body language, facial expressions, verbal cues, and other indications that have to do with emotion but it does not exclusively deal with the unconscious. Little is known about the unconscious mind or about how decisions are made based on unconscious communications except that they are always unintentional. There are two types of unconscious communications: intrapersonal and interpersonal. Research has shown that human conscious attention can attend to 5‚Äì9 items simultaneously. All other information is processed by the unconscious mind. For example, the unconscious mind sometimes picks up on and relates nonverbal cues about an individual based on how they have arranged their settings such as their home or place of work.  Unconscious mind  Not much is known about the unconscious mind but it is believed to contain the biological instincts that humans act on every day, such as sex and aggression. A person is completely unaware of what happens within the unconscious mind. Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud made the concept of the unconscious popular; and he based most of his theories on psychoanalysis on the concept. According to Freud, the subconscious mind rests right below the conscious mind, and has easy access to the thoughts and feelings that are kept in this state ‚Äî as opposed to the unconscious mind (access to which is, in Freud's view, impossible). Freud believed that we projected our unconscious emotions onto others.  Intrapersonal  Intrapersonal communication is language use or thought internal to the communicator. It includes many mental activities such as thinking, calculating, planning, talking to one's self, internal monologue, day-dreaming. Intrapersonal communication affects how people perceive themselves: either in a negative or positive way. Joseph Jordania hypothesized that intrapersonal communication was created to avoid silence because as social creatures we feel uncomfortable with extended periods of silence. Intrapersonal unconscious communication is when dreams, previous experiences, or hypnosis affects a person‚Äôs choices or experiences unconsciously.  Interpersonal  Interpersonal communication includes message sending and message reception between two or more individuals. This can include all aspects of communication such as listening, persuading, asserting, nonverbal communication, and more. Interpersonal unconscious communication includes unintentional facial expressions, body language, tone of voice, and speech patterns while interacting with another individual that the other individual interprets for their own knowledge. Studies suggest that when presented with an emotional facial expression, participants instinctively react with movement in facial muscles that are mimicking the original facial expression. There are six different reasons for nonverbal communication: # Complementing: adding extra information to verbal communication # Contradicting: the nonverbal messages contradict one's verbal messages # Repeating: emphasize or clarify the verbal message # Regulating: coordinate the verbal dialogue between people # Substituting: when a nonverbal message is used in place of a verbal message # Accenting: emphasizing a particular point in a verbal message See also References Human communication Unconscious ","title":"Unconscious communication"},{"id":"709237","title":"Royal Academy of Engineering"},{"id":"709239","text":"A single column of the Westgate Bridge during construction. (date unknown) The West Gate Bridge is a steel box girder cable-stayed bridge in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, spanning the Yarra River just north of its mouth into Port Phillip. It is a vital link between the inner city (CBD) and Melbourne's western suburbs, with the industrial suburbs in the west, and with the city of Geelong to the south-west. It is part of one of the busiest road corridors in Australia. The main river span is in length, and the height above the water is . The total length of the bridge is . It is the fifth-longest in Australia, the longest being Melbourne's Bolte Bridge at . The West Gate Bridge is twice as long as the Sydney Harbour Bridge and is one of the highest road decks in Australia, clearing the water at , with the Sydney Harbour Bridge clearing the water at . The bridge passes over Westgate Park, a large environmental and recreational reserve created during the bridge's construction, and carries up to 200,000 vehicles per day. Transportation Motor vehicles The West Gate Bridge is a 10-lane dual-carriageway freeway bridge, carrying five lanes of motor vehicle traffic in each direction. The freeway corridor (including the bridge itself) carries a very high volume and occupancy of traffic: a total of between 180,000‚Äì200,000 cars, trucks, and motorcycles use it per day, according to VicRoads. This makes the West Gate Bridge and West Gate Freeway one of the busiest road corridors in Australia. However, being the only main direct link between Melbourne's CBD and the West, it is frequently congested during the morning and afternoon peaks (despite having five lanes in each direction) and is constantly busy 24/7 due to the number and type of vehicles coming in and out of Melbourne (i.e.) Port of Melbourne. The bridge was originally tolled. Tolls were abolished in 1985, because drivers were using other routes to avoid the toll. The bridge is rather windswept as there are no significant obstructing terrain features for some distance, particularly in the quadrant from south to west, a common wind direction. This can lead to issues for motorbikes, trucks and other high-sided vehicles in higher wind speeds, a common occurrence on this bridge. Previously wind warning lights were present at the bridge approaches to control traffic (Amber - bridge closed to motorbikes and high vehicles, Red - closed to all traffic), but the current practice now is to reduce speed limit to 40 km/h when the wind speed gets too high. Cycling Cyclists are prohibited from using the bridge except for special bicycle events, notably the MS Summer cycle, which is a fundraising event for multiple sclerosis, and the Around the Bay in a Day Bicycle Network event that raises money for The Smith Family charity. The Westgate Punt is a foot ferry that runs directly below the bridge, taking cyclists and pedestrians across the Yarra between a jetty at Fishermans Bend near Westgate Park ‚Äì Bay Trail and a jetty adjacent to Scienceworks Museum ‚Äì Hobsons Bay Coastal Trail. It operates on demand, from Monday to Friday in morning and evening peaks, and on weekends and public holidays from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm.  History   Collapse  ABC report on the collapse. Two years into construction of the bridge, at 11:50 am on 15 October 1970, the 112-metre (367-foot) span between piers 10 and 11 collapsed and fell 50 metres (164 feet) to the ground and water below. Thirty-five construction workers were killed and 18 injured, and it remains Australia's worst industrial accident to this day. Many of those who perished were on lunch break beneath the structure in workers' huts, which were crushed by the falling span. Others were working on and inside the span when it fell. The whole mass plummeted into the Yarra River mud with an explosion of gas, dust and mangled metal that shook buildings hundreds of metres away. Nearby houses were spattered with flying mud. The roar of the impact, the explosion, and the fire that followed, could be clearly heard over away. On the following morning, 16 October, Sir Henry Bolte (Premier of Victoria) announced that a Royal Commission would be set up immediately to look into the cause of the disaster. The Prime Minister, John Gorton, said: \\"I am sure the whole of Australia is shocked and saddened by the serious accident at West Gate Bridge. Please extend my deepest sympathy to all those families to whom this tragic event has brought such grief.\\"'West Gate', Bill Hitchings, 1979, Outback Press. = Cause = The West Gate Bridge as seen from the walkway near the West Gate Bridge Memorial Park A Royal Commission into the collapse was established, which concluded on 14 July 1971. It attributed the failure of the bridge to two causes: the structural design by designers Freeman Fox & Partners, and an unusual method of construction by World Services and Construction, the original contractors of the project. On the day of the collapse, there was a difference in camber of between two half-girders at the west end of the span which needed to be joined. It was proposed that the higher one be weighted down with 10 concrete blocks, each weighing , which were located on-site. The weight of these blocks caused the span to buckle, which was a sign of structural failure. The longitudinal joining of the half-girders was partially complete when orders came through to remove the buckle. As the bolts were removed, the bridge snapped back and the span collapsed. = Collapse memorials = Six twisted fragments of the collapsed bridge can be found adorning the gardens in the engineering faculty of Monash University, Clayton campus. It is said by students that they are to remind engineers of the consequences of their errors. Monash University acquired these when asked to participate in the investigation of the collapse. Commemorations have been held on 15 October every year since the collapse. A West Gate Bridge Memorial Park to workers who lost their lives is located near the bridge. It opened on the 34th anniversary of the collapse, 15 October 2004. It includes the existing West Gate Bridge Memorial and Sculpture, and the memorial for six who died in the Spotswood Yarra Sewer Tunnel collapse of 12 April 1895 (Good Friday). Completion Construction resumed in 1972, but with World Services and Construction continuing to fabricate the boxes and to carry out their sub-assembly, but with John Holland Group completing the construction of the steel portion of the bridge. The bridge was completed in 1978. After 10 years of construction, the bridge, a part of the larger West Gate Freeway, cost $202 million. Speed cameras were erected on the bridge in 2004, but were not activated until September 2005, because of issues with a similar camera on the Western Ring Road. However these speed cameras were switched off in 2005, and currently remain disabled, as the sway of the bridge prevents secondary verification of the alleged speed against a fixed point. In 2006 the State Government spent $1.3 million on erecting railway style boom barriers at each entrance to the bridge to block traffic in the event of a terrorist attack. In March 2007, the State Government announced that two flagpoles would be erected atop the main bridge pylons, to fly the Australian and Victorian flags, each being in size and above sea level. Costing $350,000 to install and $15,000 a year to maintain, the flags were unfurled on 24 September 2008. On 5 August 2007, it was reported that the Victorian Government was planning a $240 million project to identify and eliminate structural weaknesses in the bridge, with specific concerns including crash barriers, cracking, corrosion and potential buckling. News of the work was prompted by the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis. Experts were reported as saying the West Gate was initially designed to carry loads of but now carried B-double trucks weighing up to . The bridge was built to carry 40,000 vehicles a day, but volumes are now more than four times the original amount, approximately 160,000 vehicles on an average day. Expansion On 17 May 2006, the State Government as part of its Meeting Our Transport Challenges plan announced plans to change traffic flow in peak periods on the West Gate Bridge and approaches to it, using a reversible lane to provide five traffic lanes in the peak direction, opposing traffic having three lanes. This was to be done using overhead signals and barriers; the State Government allocated funds to this project in its 2006‚Äì2007 state budget, but the works were never carried out. In 2008 the expansion plans were revised as part of the Victorian Transport Plan, when it was announced that the bridge would be widened to five lanes in each direction, the space being gained by narrowing the existing traffic lanes and closing the emergency lanes, in a move criticised by Victorian fire, police and ambulance unions. Overhead gantries would be used to direct traffic out of lanes when breakdowns and accidents occur. Costed at $240 million, each lane would be wide; by comparison, lanes on the Sydney Harbour Bridge have a width of . Roads Minister Tim Pallas claimed that the plan would allow the bridge to carry 50 percent more vehicles, while reducing crashes by 20 percent. Structural analysis work on the bridge concluded in early 2009, and was completed over a 14-month period. Works to strengthen the bridge commenced in the first half of 2009, with the entire strengthening project scheduled for completion in 2011. On 22 June 2011, all five lanes were finally opened to the public in both directions, with the completion of the required strengthening works. The full cost was $347 million, $107 million more than VicRoads had originally planned, but included considerable additional scope of works. This cost increase was after the deletion of $20 million architectural lighting originally included in the scope of the works. The engineers for the strengthening project, Flint & Neill and Sinclair Knight Merz, won the 2012 Institution of Structural Engineers Supreme Award for structural engineering for the project. Flag On 11 March 2014, a artist-designed flag was raised on the western side of the bridge as part of the 'Melbourne Now' exhibition, ‚ÄòOn Top of the World: Flags for Melbourne‚Äô. The flag was a collaborative design between four contributing artists involved in the show who shared an affinity with the bridge. The flag design is a reference to 1803 maritime communications by Rear Admiral Home Riggs Popham, the symbol on the flag meaning ‚ÄòI can spare what you asked for‚Äô. The flag was flown until the end of the 'Melbourne Now' show on 25 March 2014.http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/melbournenow/projects/007 Melbourne Now Artists Brook Andrew, Helen Johnson, Kate Daw and Jon Campbell were collaborating with Stewart Russell as curator.  Future  The West Gate Bridge at sunset, with Docklands Stadium in the foreground Westgate Park's saltwater lake is near the West Gate Bridge, and turns pink in summer (March 2019) Strong growth in suburbs along the route, and increased freight through the Port of Melbourne, means that the corridor is experiencing traffic congestion during peak periods, is vulnerable to short-term interruptions, and is rapidly approaching capacity. Proposals to abate congestion by allowing more traffic have included bridge widening, a tunnel underneath the river, or adding a second deck to the bridge. Many such plans have come under fire from community groups such as the Public Transport Users Association and Environment Victoria, which advocate investment in alternative forms of transport. A private sector report, made public in February 2006, suggested building a companion tunnel to the West Gate Bridge under the Yarra River, made up of three separate bores to carry traffic in either direction and a freight rail line. The portals would have been north of Williamstown Road in Port Melbourne, and between Blackshaws and Melbourne roads in Altona North. The State Government also assessed options for the development of another east‚Äìwest link in 2008. Sir Rod Eddington, Chairman of the Victorian Major Events Company and former CEO of British Airways, was to head the assessment of the future east‚Äìwest connections and recommend the best way forward for public transport, road and freight travel for the entire Monash-West Gate corridor. By December 2008 the State Government announced it was planning for such a link, anticipated to be a three-kilometre road tunnel under Footscray and the Maribyrnong River. Linking Dynon and Footscray Roads in the Port of Melbourne precinct to Geelong Road in West Footscray, now known as the East- West road connection, its cost is estimated at more than $2.5 billion. Incidents Suicide location Police data show up to one suicide occurs every three weeks at the West Gate Bridge. A 2004 coroner's report recommended anti-suicide fencing or barriers be erected on the bridge to deter people from attempting to end their lives. In 2008, the bodies of a mother in her late 20s and her 18-month-old baby were found on the river bank below the West Gate Bridge; this prompted further calls to erect a suicide barrier. Those who argued for a suicide barrier claimed that most of those who jump from the West Gate Bridge do so through impulse, and that police officers who try to save those who try to jump are putting their own lives in danger. There have been multiple incidents of police officers dangling off the side of the bridge while holding onto would-be jumpers. A 2000 Royal Melbourne Hospital study on people who jumped from the bridge found at least 62 cases between 1991 and 1998. Seven people survived the fall. 74 percent of those who jumped from the bridge were male, with an average age of 33. More than 70 percent were suffering from mental illness. Of those who jumped off the West Gate Bridge, 31 percent fell onto land. Some of those who landed in water drowned afterwards.  Murder of Darcey Freeman  A Melbourne girl, Darcey Freeman, aged 4, was thrown off the bridge by her father, Arthur Freeman, in January 2009, and, after surviving the fall, she later died in hospital. In April 2011, Freeman was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison. The apparent trigger for the incident was his recent separation and apparent fear of loss of access to the children (similar to the 2005 Robert Farquarson case). Following the incident, a temporary suicide barrier of concrete crash barriers topped with a welded mesh fence was erected, starting in February. By June, it was claimed that the fence had prevented two suicides. A permanent barrier was later installed along the length of the bridge. The barriers are costed at $20 million.

In other media Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Giant-Man in Captain America: Civil War. Scott Lang / Ant-Man (portrayed by Paul Rudd) serves as the Marvel Cinematic Universe equivalent of Giant-Man; various interviews with directors Anthony and Joe Russo, Marvel Studios's head Kevin Feige, and Ant-Man director Peyton Reed confirmed this. In Captain America: Civil War (2016), Ant-Man grows in size during a battle against Iron Man's faction of Avengers, allowing Captain America and Bucky Barnes to escape. In Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), Scott Lang goes giant when going after Sonny Burch's gang, becoming extremely fatigued if he is giant for too long. In Avengers: Endgame (2019), he uses the form to break free of the ruin of the New Avengers facility and subsequently joins the Battle of Earth as Giant-Man.

The second Yellowjacket, she is initially a reluctant supervillainess and later superheroine. Publication history Yellowjacket first appeared in The Avengers #264 (February 1986), and was created by Roger Stern and John Buscema. Years later, she was featured as a regular character in the Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers titles. Guardians of the Galaxy writer/artist Jim Valentino reminisced, \\"It was my group's first foray into the 20th Century. I knew they were going to meet the Masters of Evil ... She was a member of the Masters of Evil at the time and I liked her. I thought it would be nice to have someone see the 31st Century through present-day eyes. It would give a new perspective, so I asked if I could have her. They said yes, and even though I never got the chance to write her in, they put her in the group after I was gone.\\" Yellowjacket was one of the feature characters in the 2011 three-issue limited series Chaos War: Dead Avengers. Fictional character biography Criminal career When first seen, Rita DeMara was a reluctant supervillainess who had stolen one of Hank Pym's Yellowjacket costumes, and modified it, making it more feminine (and removing the insect emblem). However, when she clashed with the Wasp, she became terrified upon shrinking, and was captured.Avengers #264 Yellowjacket participates in a takeover of the Avengers Mansion, assisting one of the more powerful versions of the Masters of Evil as a professional criminal.Avengers #273-277 Defeated, Yellowjacket is sent to prison but is freed by the Fixer with amorous intentions. She flees and tries to gain revenge on the Wasp, but is distracted by the sight of Black Knight. Furious at being rejected, the Fixer tries to kill her. Black Knight helps Yellowjacket defeat him and the two part on possibly romantic terms.Solo Avengers #12 During a time when no Avengers were active, her costume receives a call for help from an automated system at an old Avengers base. She finds herself teaming up with the Beast, The Captain, Falcon, Hercules, the Hulk and Jocasta. They battle the High Evolutionary wishing to jumpstart humanity's evolution through worldwide catastrophe. Yellowjacket helps battle through the Evolutionary's underground submarine base, fighting against dozens of his soldiers. Eventually the Evolutionary is defeated by Hercules, the two evolving out of reality.Avengers Annual #17 She later briefly serves as a member of Superia's Femizons.Captain America #389-391 Her second affiliation with the Masters of Evil begins and ends during the Infinity War. Her team, led by Doctor Octopus, confronts the Guardians of the Galaxy inside the Avengers Mansion as the Masters had wished to take it over. Yellowjacket is soon betrayed by her side. Moments later, both teams are overwhelmed by waves of evil aliens. These aliens were impersonating all the super-powered beings involved. Each double wishes to take over the relevant body. Despite many aliens being slain, more show up. The Guardians and the Masters both work together to stay alive. Events in the Infinity War series stop the flow of aliens. When Doctor Octopus desires to continue the fight, his men turn on him, not wanting to hurt those who had helped them. Yellowjacket is left behind and joined the Guardians. Guardians of the Galaxy Yellowjacket went to the 31st century with Guardians of the Galaxy. She further proves her worth when she saved the life of Charlie-27 by shrinking, flying inside his throat, and performing \\"surgery\\" on a massive blood clot with her stings. She forms a close friendship with Nikki. She later uses 31st century technology to redesign her costume, making it look less like Henry Pym's design (she even found a way to fly without installing wings on her costume). She used her powers as a valued member of the team, until, homesick, she attempts to return to the 20th century. On the way, she stops in the near future and learns that a disaster was about to happen to the Avengers in her target time.

It begins in Glasgow at the M8 motorway at Kinning Park, and terminates near Kilmarnock at Fenwick, becoming the A77 dual carriageway. Changes were made in 2005 segregating a lane on the M8 motorway almost as far as the Kingston Bridge, which in January 2006 was extended further onto the bridge itself. It forms the most northerly part of the A77 trunk road which links Glasgow to Stranraer in the South West of Scotland. (The A77 itself continues to Portpatrick in Dumfries and Galloway.)  History  The original M77 was a short spur route which took traffic from the M8 motorway in the Kinning Park area of Glasgow, ending at a roundabout on Dumbreck Road close to Bellahouston Park, although prior to this there had been an unused spur running to roughly Ibrox telephone exchange on Gower Street. A large number of accidents and pollution problems caused in the Giffnock and Newton Mearns districts by commuter traffic and heavy lorries (the A77 is the main route for ferry-bound traffic sailing to Northern Ireland), saw an extension being built to the motorway in 1994 to bypass these areas, which was opened in 1997. This was fiercely opposed by environmentalists, who set up a road protest camp, as it meant that the motorway would cut through the historic Pollok Country Park. Approval for the extension was granted and construction went ahead. A threatening visit in 1995 to the protesters of 'Pollok Free State' by the Conservative Member of Parliament Allan Stewart (then the MP for Eastwood the constituency including Newton Mearns, which the new road would bypass), accompanied by his airgun- wielding son, resulted in a political shot in the foot, contributing to his subsequent resignation, and a fine for his son in Paisley Sheriff Court. The Conservatives lost the Eastwood seat in the next election in 1997. The latest upgrade was instigated in 2003, and involved extending the M77 a further south to the village of Fenwick, near Kilmarnock. This replaced the dangerous 4-lane single carriageway of the A77 that dropped to a two lane single carriageway for the bend just north of the very sharp Mearns Road turn-off, and the A77/B764 (Eaglesham) junction (causing vehicles to queue dangerously on the outside lane on a bend to enter the B764 from the south) which were prone to fatal accidents. The scheme also included the Glasgow Southern Orbital (GSO) which bypasses the B764 Eaglesham Moor road to East Kilbride. This also resulted in the closure of junction 5 on its previous site at Malletsheugh and the creation of a new junction 5 at Maidenhill. The works were completed in April 2005. In 2006, junction 2 was rebuilt in conjunction with the building of the adjacent Silverburn Shopping Centre. The northbound off-ramp and southbound on-ramp are now routed via the access roundabout to the shopping centre. In 2010 a relief lane was constructed between Plantation and junction 1 southbound. The purpose of this was to ease the congestion that regularly occurs during peak rush hour. The original segment of the A77 between Newton Mearns and Fenwick that previously carried the traffic now accommodated by the M77 has been converted into a two-lane single carriageway with cycle lanes. The remainder of the road through Newton Mearns has been converted into a two- lane dual carriageway with cycle lanes. The cycle lanes end at Eastwood Toll in Giffnock.

Following completion in 2011, the motorway is long. Despite being only a two lane motorway, parts of the M80 Stepps Bypass are used by around 60,000 vehicles per day. The M80 was constructed in three sections. The first section, from the village of Haggs to the M9 near Stirling, opened in 1974, followed in 1992 by the section from the M8 to the small town of Stepps. The section from Stepps to Haggs was completed in September 2011, though it partially opened in February 2011 when the Moodiesburn bypass, from Stepps to the M73 at Mollinsburn, was completed; the section of the A80 from Mollinsburn to Haggs was then upgraded.\\"M80 Moodiesburn bypass set to open\\". STV News. 8 February 2011  Route   M8 to Stepps (Junctions 1 to 3)  This section of road was originally envisioned during the M8's construction in the 1960s, but was not realised until 1992), also known as the 'Stepps Bypass' begins at M8 Junction 13 in the Glasgow suburb of Blochairn. It runs to the north of Stepps, under the Cumbernauld Railway Line with exits for Bishopbriggs, Lenzie and Kirkintilloch, where it continues onto the new section, completed in 2011. Blackhill, with the bridge carrying the Cumbernauld-Stepps railway line  Stepps to Haggs (Junctions 3 to 7)  The Stepps to Haggs section was completed in September 2011, completing the M80 route. A short section of offline upgrade takes the route from the former terminus at Junction 3 (Stepps), to a new Junction with the M73. After this, the route follows an on- line upgrade of the former A80 through Cumbernauld. It is mainly 2-lane dual carriageway. Haggs to Pirnhall (Junctions 7 to 9) At the junction with the A803, the road rejoins the older section of the M80 (opened in 1974) and runs for about until it meets the M876 for traffic towards the Kincardine Bridge. The M80 then continues north, passing to the west of Denny and after meets a junction with the A91 (the same roundabout interchange also hosts Stirling Services) and then merges into the M9 just outside Stirling at Bannockburn.  M80 Stepps to Haggs Completion  The M80 Stepps to Haggs Completion Project connected the two halves of the current motorway via an online upgrade of the existing A80, passing through Cumbernauld and Auchenkilns, and the offline creation of new motorway from Stepps to Mollinsburn. Although various plans were considered from the 1970s to 1990s to connect the two sections of motorway, it was not until 2003 that a definitive timeline for proposing, developing and executing a completion plan was announced. Two routes were proposed for development: the so-called Kelvin Valley route, which would create a bypass to the north of the existing line of the A80, and the \\"online\\" upgrade of the existing A80 to motorway grade. In October 2005, the project was put to a public inquiry, which ended in August 2006. The Kelvin Valley route was not chosen as it would have breached the Antonine Wall and destroyed the Castlecary Roman fort; instead the online upgrade of the A80 through Cumbernauld was selected. Originally budgeted to cost ¬£130m to ¬£180m, but was estimated to cost ¬£320m, preparatory works were started in November 2008, and construction work began in January 2009. The project was completed in September 2011. The upgrade plans were set into three discrete phases. Phase one involved the creation of 8 kilometres of road from Stepps, routing north of Muirhead, Moodiesburn and Chryston, and meeting the line of the existing A80 at Mollinsburn with the construction of a new interchange, connecting the M80 with the M73 and the western section of the A80. Phase two required the online upgrade of the A80 between Mollinsburn and Auchenkilns, with the attendant upgrade of adjoining on-slip and off-slip roads, meeting the Auchenkilns Interchange. The interchange was opened in November 2005 after the online grade separation of the Auchenkilns Roundabout from the line of the dual carriageway created a grade separated dumbbell interchange, linking the A80 (and subsequently the M80) with the A73 and B8048. Phase three saw the A80 upgraded online from Auchenkilns to the Haggs Interchange east of Cumbernauld ‚Äì also seeing some junctions being upgraded, but with some being removed ‚Äì completing the connection of the western M80 to the eastern M80, and connecting to the M876 and M9 motorways.

Despite attempting to capture the Avengers with Adhesive X and spreading it over the city, the Avengers find an antidote with the help of Paste-Pot Pete, give it to the Masters in secret (causing them to accidentally free people), and then send most of the members to jail. Zemo is tricked into opening a container filled with tear gas inside his helicopter, but escapes anyway.The Avengers #6 (July 1964). Marvel Comics.

After defeating Zemo, Captain America returns on Zemo's helicopter and stops Zemo from shooting the Avengers. However, the Enchantress casts a spell which gets the helicopter to the rooftop she and the Executioner are on.

A self-aware and highly intelligent robot created by Hank Pym, the character is usually depicted as a dark reflection of his creator and harbors a strong grudge against him. Ultron's goal to destroy humanity has often brought him into conflict with the Avengers, who always managed to thwart and destroy him, but he would return time and time again. While he usually controls a legion of mindless drones known as \\"Ultron Sentries\\" to help him achieve his goals, Ultron has also been part of several supervillain teams. The character is notable for being the first to wield the fictional metal alloy adamantium and creating Vision. Ultron has been featured in several media adaptations over the years, including animated series and video games. Tom Kane and Jim Meskimen are the most prominent actors to provide the character's voice. Ultron made his live-action debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), played by James Spader. Publication history The character Ultron initially appeared as an unnamed character in a cameo in The Avengers #54 (1968), with a first full appearance in Avengers #55 (1968). Ultron was created by writer Roy Thomas and artist John Buscema. Thomas, who has acknowledged he finds naming characters difficult, said he liked the -tron suffix and went from there.The Hollywood Reporter: \\"Marvel Legend Reveals What Stan Lee Initially \\"Hated\\" About 'Age of Ultron' Breakout\\" Thomas said the idea of the character and his appearance were heavily based on Makino, an obscure robotic villain who appeared in an issue of the Captain Video comic book. He liked the robot's malicious looking smile, showing this to Buscema.

When Tony Stark A.I.'s team and Captain America's team confront each other, they are captured by Ultron who forces both teams to sit at a dinner table.

Powers and abilities The visual appearance and powers of the character have varied, but common powers include superhuman levels of strength, speed, stamina, durability, and reflexes; flight at subsonic speeds; and various offensive weapons such as concussive blasts of energy fired from its optical sensors or hands and an \\"encephalo-ray\\", which places victims into a deathlike coma.

Ultron's outer armor is usually composed primarily of adamantium, which is almost completely impervious to damage (the first use of the term \\"adamantium\\" in Marvel Comics was made in reference to Ultron in Avengers #66, published in July 1969). Most Ultron units are powered by a small internal nuclear furnace and incorporate a \\"program transmitter\\" which can beam part or all of Ultron's memory/personality system into other computer systems or duplicate robotic bodies. Ultron can also control other machines remotely. Ultron has occasionally reformed itself with a humanoid appearance above the waist and the appearance of a complex machine, including tractor beam apparatus for flight, below the waist.

While initially conceived to analyze and prevent possible extraterrestrial threats to Earth, Ultron quickly becomes self-aware and concludes that humanity is slowly destroying the planet. After seemingly killing J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron builds himself a crude body using parts left from a destroyed Iron Legion drone and takes control of the Iron Legion to attack the Avengers. He announces his intentions before Thor destroys him and subsequently builds himself a new body and an army of Ultron Sentries using technology from an abandoned HYDRA base in Sokovia. To further his goals, he also recruits Wanda and Pietro Maximoff and threatens arms dealer Ulysses Klaue into providing him with vibranium. The deal is ambushed by Stark, Thor, and Steve Rogers, resulting in Ultron's body being destroyed again. After transferring his conscience into an upgraded body, Ultron focuses on creating an organic body using vibranium, but he is betrayed by the Maximoff twins after they discover his true intentions and the Avengers steal the cradle containing the body following another battle, resulting in Vision's creation.

Early life Hagan was born and grew up in Youngstown, Ohio, as one of fourteen siblings (including a twin brother, James). Hagan's father, Robert Hagan, was a Trumbull County Commissioner and, later, a State Representative. After graduating from Ursuline High School, Hagan attended Youngstown State University (then known as Youngstown State College). He was drafted for military service during the Vietnam War and served in Germany in the late 1960s. After leaving the military, he worked as a baker and steelworker in Youngstown before going on to earn a degree in urban studies from the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University in 1975. He then worked as a social worker in Youngstown. Political career In 1978, Hagan became chairman of the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party, beating Garfield Heights ward leader Henry S. Trubiano. In that position, he became one of the first Democrats to endorse Edward M. Kennedy in the 1980 presidential election over the sitting Democratic President Jimmy Carter. Prior to his endorsement, Hagan had been a guest of Kennedy at his home in Hyannisport. Hagan was appointed Cuyahoga County's county recorder, but he failed to keep the seat in an election. He then ran for a seat on the Cuyahoga County board of commissioners, losing to Republican Virgil Brown. He ran again in 1981, this time successfully. Hagan served on the county commission for 16 years (1982‚Äì1998). In 1989, Hagan made an unsuccessful attempt for the office of mayor of Cleveland, losing the Democratic primary to Ohio State Senator Michael R. White, who went on to defeat Cleveland City Council President George L. Forbes in the general election. In 1992, with White's endorsement, Hagan made an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, losing in the Democratic primary to incumbent U.S. Rep. Mary Rose Oakar. Hagan described himself as an avowed liberal, ingrained by his father's politics, and expressed regret at the conservative trend in the Democratic Party in the 1990s. He was known to quote Albert Camus in his speeches, a habit that did not earn him the affection of blue-collar voters. However, he allowed for compromises with his innate liberalism, agreeing to go along with government funding for the Cleveland Gateway project, which included the construction of Jacobs Field and Gund Arena. Hagan has received praise from both sides of the political aisle. Republican Jim Petro, the state auditor and former fellow county commissioner, called him \\"the most honorable politician I've ever known.\\" He even earned the friendship of former rival Forbes, who, during the 1989 election, had described Hagan as a \\"pimp.\\" Hagan ran into political trouble when it was revealed that Cuyahoga County Treasurer Francis E. Gaul (famous for saying that \\"Most people in Cleveland think Camus is the whale at SeaWorld,\\" in reference to Hagan) had made risky investments using county funds, having assured the Board of Commissioners that the Secured Assets Fund Earnings fund was free of risk. Hagan was called as a witness for the defense in Gaul's trial, saying that he had \\"implicitly\\" trusted Gaul's reassurances that the investments were safe. It was 1994, however, and the booming economy mitigated the county treasury's losses and Hagan managed to win re-election to the board of commissioners. In 1996, Hagan announced that he would retire from electoral politics after his term expired at the end of 1998, stating: \\"I'm in the twilight of a mediocre career. But I'm looking forward to going to the grocery store without someone asking me for a job.\\" In 2002, he ran for the office of Governor of Ohio and lost to the incumbent Republican, Robert A. Taft II. Hagan's campaign against Taft using a duck quacking \\"Taftquack\\" raised trademark issues with the American Family Life Insurance Company's trademarked \\"AFLAC\\" quacking duck. The federal court in the Northern District of Ohio found that Hagan's commercial neither infringed nor diluted the AFLAC mark. 266 F. Supp. 2d 682. In February 2004, Hagan announced his intention to run again for a seat on the Cuyahoga County commission against fellow Democrat and former colleague, Tim McCormack. Hagan easily defeated McCormack in the Democratic primary election and faced no Republican opposition in the November 2004 general election. In November 2008, he was re-elected to the Cuyahoga County commission without opposition. In November 2009, the voters of Cuyahoga County voted to change its governmental structure. Tim Hagan retired as Cuyahoga County Commissioner in 2011, when the county switched to an Executive-Council Form of government. Personal life Mulgrew and Hagan In 1973, Hagan married Jeanne Marie Carney. Carney's father, John Carney, a successful property developer and later judge, helped Hagan to get his start in Democratic politics in his brother James Carney's 1971 campaign for mayor of Cleveland. They had two daughters, Eleanor and Marie. They divorced in 1995. In 1999, Hagan married actress Kate Mulgrew. As of 2014, they had divorced. Hagan has a close relationship with members of the Kennedy family‚Äîhe is a godfather to Kate Kennedy Townsend, one of Robert F. Kennedy's grandchildren, and was a pallbearer at the funeral of Stephen E. Smith, the late husband of Jean Kennedy Smith. Hagan's father, Robert E. Hagan, served as a county commissioner on the board of commissioners of Trumbull County, Ohio, and in the Ohio General Assembly. Hagan's brother Robert F. Hagan was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives.

Along with the 6 preceding and 156 subsequent s, they formed the \\"flush-deck\\" or \\"four-stack\\" type. Only a few were completed in time to serve in World War I, including , the lead ship of the class. While some were scrapped in the 1930s, the rest served through World War II. Most of these were converted to other uses; nearly all in U.S. service had half their boilers and one or more stacks removed to increase fuel and range or accommodate troops. Others were transferred to the British Royal Navy and the Royal Canadian Navy, some of which were later transferred to the Soviet Navy. All were scrapped within a few years after World War II.  Background  The destroyer type was at this time a relatively new class of fighting ship for the U.S. Navy. The type arose in response to torpedo boats that had been developing from 1865, especially after the development of the self-propelled Whitehead torpedo.Friedman, p.8 During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, it was realized that a torpedo boat destroyer was urgently needed to screen the larger warships, so much so that a special war plans board headed by Theodore Roosevelt issued an urgent report pleading for this type of ship.Friedman p.11 A series of destroyers had been built over the preceding years, designed for high smooth water speed, with indifferent results, especially poor performance in heavy seas and poor fuel economy.Friedman p.14‚Äì15 The lesson of these early destroyers was the appreciation of the need for true seakeeping and seagoing abilities.Friedman p.15 There were few cruisers in the Navy, which was a fleet of battleships and destroyers (no cruisers had been launched since 1908) so destroyers performed scouting missions. A report of October 1915 by Captain W. S. Sims noted that the smaller destroyers used fuel far too quickly, and that war games showed the need for fast vessels with a larger radius of action. As a result, the size of U.S. destroyer classes increased steadily, starting at 450 tons and rising to over 1,000 tons between 1905 and 1916.Friedman, p.19-29 The increase in destroyer size has never stopped, with some US s now up to 10,800 tons full load, and the s at 14,564 tons full load. The need for high speed, economical cruising, heavy seas performance, and a high fuel capacity saw larger hulls, the inclusion of oil fuel, reduction geared steam turbines with cruising turbines, and increased fuel capacity.Friedman p.28‚Äì29, 34, 40‚Äì41 With World War I then in its second year and tensions between the U.S. and Germany increasing, the U.S. needed to expand its navy. The Naval Appropriation Act of 1916 called for a navy \\"second to none,\\" capable of protecting both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The Act authorized 10 battleships, 6 s, 10 scout cruisers, and 50 Wickes-class destroyers.Wickes- and Clemson-class flush-deck destroyers A subsequent General Board recommendation for further destroyers to combat the submarine threat resulted in a total of 267 Wickes- and Clemson- class destroyers completed. However, the design of the ships remained optimized for operation with the battleship fleet.Friedman, p.40  Design  The requirements of the new design were high speed and mass production. The development of submarine warfare during World War I created a requirement for destroyers in numbers that had not been contemplated before the war. A top speed of was needed for operation with the Lexington battlecruisers and Omaha cruisers. The final design had a flush deck and four smokestacks. It was a fairly straightforward evolution of the preceding Caldwell class. General dissatisfaction with the earlier \\"1,000 ton\\" designs (Cassin and Tucker classes) led to the fuller hull form of the \\"flush deck\\" type. Greater beam and the flush deck provided greater hull strength. In addition, the Wickes class had ( more than the Caldwell class), providing an extra . The machinery arrangement of some of the Caldwells was used, with geared steam turbines on two shafts.Friedman, p.37-39 The extra power required an extra 100 tons of engine and reduction gears. The design included an even keel and nearly horizontal propeller shafts to minimize weight. As construction was undertaken by ten different builders, there was considerable variation in the types of boilers and turbines installed to meet a guaranteed speed requirement. However, there were in essence two basic designs; one for the ships built by the Bethlehem Steel yards (including Union Iron Works) and another used by the remaining shipyards, which was prepared by Bath Iron Works. The Wickes class proved to be short-ranged, and its bridge and gun positions were very wet. The fleet found that the tapered stern, which made for a nice depth charge deployment feature, dug into the water and increased the turning radius, thus hampering anti-submarine work.Friedman, p.45-46 The Clemson class added 100 tons of fuel tankage to improve operational range, but the issue of range was solved only with the development of underway replenishment in World War II.  Armament  The main armament was the same as the Caldwell class: four /50 caliber guns and twelve torpedo tubes. While the gun armament was typical for destroyers of this period, the torpedo armament was larger than usual, in accordance with American practice at the time. A factor in the size of the torpedo armament was the General Board's decision to use broadside rather than centerline torpedo tubes.Friedman, p. 24,34 This was due to the desire to have some torpedoes remaining after firing a broadside, and problems experienced with centerline mounts on previous classes with torpedoes striking the gunwales of the firing ship.Friedman, p. 24 The Mark 8 torpedo was initially equipped, and probably remained the standard torpedo for this class, as 600 Mark 8 torpedoes were issued to the British in 1940 as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. Most ships carried a /23 caliber anti-aircraft (AA) gun, typically just aft of the stern 4-inch gun. The original design called for two 1-pounder AA guns, but these were in short supply and the 3-inch gun was more effective.Friedman, p. 44 Anti-submarine (ASW) armament was added during World War I. Typically, a single depth charge track was provided aft, along with a Y-gun depth charge projector forward of the aft deckhouse.Friedman, p. 45  Production  8 destroyers of the Wickes class, New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, 1919. The United States Congress authorized 50 destroyers in the 1916 Act. However, the realization of the scope of the U-boat campaign resulted in 111 being built. The ships were built at Bath Iron Works, Bethlehem Steel Corporation's Fore River Shipbuilding Company, Union Iron Works, Mare Island Navy Yard, Newport News Shipbuilding, New York Shipbuilding, and William Cramp & Sons. 267 Wickes and Clemson-class destroyers were built. This program was considered a major industrial achievement. Production of these destroyers was considered so important that work on cruisers and battleships was delayed to allow completion of the program.Friedman, p.41 The first Wickes-class vessel was launched on 11 November 1917, with four more by the end of the year. Production peaked in July 1918, when 17 were launched - 15 of them on 4 July. The program continued after the war ended: 21 of the Wickes class (and all but 9 of the Clemson class) were launched after the armistice on 11 November 1918. The last of the Wickes class was launched on 24 July 1919. This program left the U.S. Navy with so many destroyers that no new destroyers were built until 1932.Friedman, p.47  Ships in class  111 Wickes-class destroyers were built.  Sub- classes  Some of these ships are also referred to as Little class (52 ships), Lamberton class (11 ships), or Tattnall class (10 ships) to signify the yard that built them and to note the slight design differences from the Bath Iron Works ships. Some of these non-Bath Iron Works units were actually commissioned prior to the lead ship, Wickes.  Operations   In U.S. service  A few Wickes class were completed in time for service in World War I, some with the battle fleet, some on convoy escort duty; none were lost. ran aground in 1921; sank after a collision in 1921. Many Wickes-class destroyers were converted to other uses, starting as early as 1920, when 14 were converted to light minelayers (hull classification symbol DM). Six of these were scrapped in 1932, and replaced by five additional conversions. Another four were converted to auxiliaries or transports at that time. Four Wickes- class DM conversions and four Clemson-class DM conversions survived to serve in World War II. During the 1930s, 23 more were scrapped, sold off, or sunk as targets. This was mostly due to a blanket replacement of 61 Yarrow-boilered destroyers 1930-31, as these boilers wore out quickly in service. Flush- deckers in reserve were commissioned as replacements.DestroyerHistory.org Flush-decker page, retrieved 16 Oct 2013 Starting in 1940, many of the remaining ships were also converted. Sixteen were converted to high-speed transports with the designation APD. Eight were converted to destroyer minesweepers (DMS). Most ships remaining in service during World War II were rearmed with dual-purpose /50 caliber guns for better anti-aircraft protection. The AVD seaplane tender conversions received 2 guns; the APD transport, DM minelayer, and DMS minesweeper conversions received 3 guns, and those retaining destroyer classification received 6. Also, half of the torpedo tubes were removed in those retained as destroyers; all torpedoes were removed from the others. Nearly all had half the boilers removed, for increased fuel and range or to accommodate troops, reducing their speed to . The low-angle Mark 9 4-inch guns removed from these ships were transferred to defensively equipped merchant ships for anti-submarine protection.Campbell 1985 p.143 had an eventful career. She was built in record time: her keel was laid on 15 May 1918, launched only 17 days later on 1 June 1918, and commissioned 54 days after that on 24 July 1918. She is credited with firing the first US shots of the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, sinking a Japanese midget submarine with gunfire before the air attack started. The sinking was uncertain until the submarine's wreck was discovered in 2002. As the high- speed transport APD-16, she was damaged beyond repair by a kamikaze attack on 7 December 1944, and was sunk after abandoning ship by gunfire from the destroyer , commanded at the time by Wards former CO from the Pearl Harbor attack.DANFS entry for USS Ward (DD-139) Thirteen Wickes class were lost during World War II in U.S. service. The remainder were scrapped between 1945 and 1947.  In foreign navies  Twenty-three Wickes-class destroyers were transferred to the Royal Navy, along with four to the Royal Canadian Navy, in 1940 under the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. Most of these ships were refitted much like the U.S. destroyers and used as convoy escorts, but some were used very little and were not considered worth refitting. , renamed , was disguised as a German vessel and expended as a blockship in the St Nazaire Raid. (A newer that was involved in the Japanese surrender formalities was a later ship.) One further destroyer was sunk; the remainder were scrapped between 1944 and 1947. In 1944 seven were transferred by Britain to the Soviet Navy, in place of Italian ships claimed by the USSR after Italy's surrender. These vessels all survived the war, and were scrapped between 1949 and 1952.

Originated in 1882 as the University of the Punjab Lahore, it was relocated in Chandigarh in the year 1947 as the East Punjab University after the partition of India, where the university was split between India and Pakistan. The university has 78 teaching and research departments and 10 centres/chairs for teaching and research at the main campus located at Chandigarh. It has 188 affiliated colleges spread over the eight districts of Punjab state and union-territory of Chandigarh, with Regional Centres at Muktsar, Ludhiana and Hoshiarpur cities in Punjab state. It is one of the most well ranked universities in India. The campus is residential, spread over in sector 14 and 25 of the city of Chandigarh. The main administrative and academic buildings are located in sector 14, beside a health centre, a sports complex, hostels and residential housing. History Panjab University featured on a 1989 stamp of India. The present-day Panjab University traces its roots to the University of the Punjab established on 14 October 1882 at Lahore (now in Punjab, Pakistan). Most of the colleges affiliated to University of the Punjab were in the present Indian part of British India. After the partition of India in 1947, the university was split into two for Indian Punjab and Pakistani Punjab. A new university was then established/relocated in the Punjab, India in 1947. To distinguish the two, the name of the university on the Indian side, the spelling for 'Punjab' was changed to Panjab. After 1947 the university had no campus of its own for nearly a decade. The administrative office was in Solan and the teaching departments functioned from Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Delhi, and Amritsar. In 1956 the university was relocated to Chandigarh, on a red sandstone campus designed by Pierre Jeanneret under the guidance of Le Corbusier. Until the re- organisation of Punjab in 1966, the university had its regional centres at Rohtak, Shimla, Jalandhar and its affiliated colleges were in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and U.T. of Chandigarh. With the re- organisation of Punjab, the university became an Inter-State Body Corporate catering to the newly organised state of Punjab and union-territory of Chandigarh. Campus The University's chequerboard layout, devised by Swiss- French Architect Pierre Jeanneret, was a role model for campus design in India. The main campus at Chandigarh is spread over 550 acres in sectors 14 and 25, the teaching area is in the north-east, with the Central Library, Fine Arts Museum, and three-winged structure of the Gandhi Bhawan forming its core; the sports complex, the health centre, student centre and the shopping centre in the middle; 16 university hostel and residential area in the south-east, stretching into the adjacent sector 25 which also houses the University Institute of Engineering and Technology and Dr. Harvansh Singh Judge Institute of dental Sciences and Hospital, UIAMS, Institute of Biological sciences etc. The campus has amenities like a State bank of India branch, Post and Sampark, public transport system, open-air theatre, guest and faculty houses, seminar complexes, staff club, several spacious lawns, botanical and medicinal herbs gardens, a newly laid rose garden, a school and a day-care centre for the employees' children. The campus is adjacent to a medical institution known as the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research. Halls of residence There are eighteen hostels on the campus including eight hostels for men and eleven women hostels including a Working Women Hostel. A Sports Hostel has been built for visiting sports teams. Two more hostels are under construction, one each for boys and girls. There is one International hostel also. All the NRI/Foreign national girls students are accommodated there.http://hostels.puchd.ac.in/hostel-handbook-2019.pdf All the hostels have Wi-Fi internet and multiple messes for students. In addition to this,all the hostels have a common room and a visitor room. There are also shopping centres and ATMs for students and faculty on campus. The Dean, Student Welfare and the Dean Student Welfare (Women) look after the functioning of the university hostels, the conduct of election to the student bodies, planning and organising of cultural and extra-curricular activities on the Campus. They disburse cultural scholarships and financial assistance to campus students. Health services The University Health Centre offers consultancy, clinical and emergency services. There are five full-time doctors, including one medical specialist, one surgical specialist and one dental specialist. Part-time consultants include a gynaecologist, a paediatrician, a radiologist, an eye specialist, an Ayurvedic doctor and two general physicians. They are supported by a large paramedical staff. Beside regular consultancy, medicines and emergency attention, employees and students have access to facilities like the clinical tests, ECG, X-Ray, ultrasonic treatment, diathermy and Yoga. The centre runs a Family Welfare Clinic with facilities of family planning, vaccination and immunisation of children (DPT, Polio and BCG).

He criticized the world history of his contemporary monk Panodorus of Alexandria for relying too much on secular sources rather than biblical sources for his dates. As a result, Annianus developed his own chronology which placed Creation on . This created the Alexandrian Era whose first day was the first day of the proleptic Alexandrian civil year in progress, . This year was eleven Paschal cycles of 532 years each before the Alexandrian year beginning , which itself was four 19-year cycles after the epoch of the Diocletian Era on . The former is known as the Era of Grace in the Coptic Church, whereas the latter is known as the Era of Martyrs. He was the first computist to recognize the 532-year cycle of Easters in the Julian calendar. This cycle is often attributed to Victorius of Aquitaine in 457, the first to recognize such a cycle in the West. None of Annianus's writings have survived. He is principally known from the discussion of his works by George Syncellus during the 9th century, though lesser fragments appear elsewhere. Elijah of Nisibis cites him in his 11th-century Chronography. However, Annianus‚Äô Paschal table of 532 years, containing a 532-year Paschal cycle based on a Metonic 19-year lunar cycle, has survived.Neugebauer (1979) 59-63 Its Metonic 19-year lunar cycle was adopted by bishop Cyril of Alexandria, who used it in his own (Greek language and Alexandrian calendar) Paschal table of 114 years.Mosshammer (2008) 202-203 Shortly before Cyril‚Äôs death (AD444), a beginning was made with a Latin language and Julian calendar Paschal table probably intended for use in the Latin part of Europe; this resulted in a similar Paschal table of 95 years, referred to as ‚Äòthe Paschal table attributed to Cyril‚Äô, which covered time interval .Declercq (2000) 80 A century later this Paschal table was continued by Dionysius Exiguus to a Paschal table covering time interval , two centuries hereafter his Paschal table was extended to Bede‚Äôs Easter table covering time interval and containing a 532-year Paschal cycle. We conclude that it is precisely Annianus‚Äô variant of the Metonic 19-year lunar cycle (invented by Anatolius) which from the sixth to the sixteenth century has been the core of the computus paschalis in the Latin Christian world, because it was not earlier than in the year 1582 that the Julian calendar was replaced with the Gregorian calendar. As far as Victorius of Aquitaine is concerned, Jan Zuidhoek, pretending to mention explicitly all relevant Metonic 19-year lunar cycles, has missed an opportunity to mention Victorius‚Äô one.Zuidhoek (2019) 72 However, Alden Mosshammer has mentioned it explicitly.Mosshammer (2008) 242 In principle, each date of the 532-year Paschal cycle of Victorius‚Äô Paschal table can be calculated by applying the old Roman rule ‚ÄúPaschal Sunday is the first Sunday after the first day after the Paschal full moon‚Äù to the corresponding date of the Paschal full moon of its lunar cycle (if desired with the help of the number indicating the weekday of ).Declercq (2000) 86‚àí87 References Bibliography * William Adler.

Celeste was vocal about concerns regarding a bill to replace overtime with comp time. \\"I think we've gone in the wrong direction,\\" he said before voting against the bill. Along with Nickie Antonio, Celeste has introduced legislation to end the death penalty in Ohio. Celeste has cited the financial burden that death row brings to the taxpayers, and that there should be a discussion on the death penalty included in the upcoming budget deliberations. Celeste has pointed to evidence that the penalty has been discriminatory toward minorities. Celeste has stated that he believes Republicans have embarked upon a \\"starve the beast\\" strategy, with their main intent being to hurt the future financial support of the Democratic Party with Senate Bill 5, and the voter-ID bill will make it harder for the traditional base to collect votes. He also stated the influence they will be able to gain through redistricting. With Andrew Brenner, Celeste has sponsored a bill that aims to support children with dyslexia. His legislation sought to demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of early reading assistance programs for children with dyslexia and to evaluate whether those programs can reduce future special education costs.

The film is based on Ira Levin's 1972 novel The Stepford Wives (filmed the first time in 1975). The 2004 version grossed $103 million worldwide on a $90 million budget. Plot Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) is a successful reality television executive producer, whose career suddenly ends after an attempted shootout by a disillusioned reality show participant. After being fired Joanna had a complete mental breakdown and she has even forgotten her wedding anniversary. With her husband, Walter (Matthew Broderick), and their two children, she moves from Manhattan to Stepford, a quiet Fairfield County, Connecticut, suburb. Joanna becomes friends with Roberta \\"Bobbie\\" Markowitz (Bette Midler), a writer and recovering alcoholic, and Roger Bannister (Roger Bart), a flamboyant gay man who has moved to town with his long-time partner, Jerry (David Marshall Grant). Joanna, Bobbie, and Roger witness an incident in which Sarah Sunderson (Faith Hill), violently dances and then collapses. Joanna argues with Walter about the incident with Sarah. He tells her that her children barely know her, their marriage is falling apart, and she is so domineering that people literally want to kill her. Walter tries to walk out of their marriage, but Joanna appeases him by trying to fit in with the other Stepford wives. Joanna changes her look and tries to become a housewife. Joanna, Bobbie, and Roger go to Sarah's home to check up on her. Sarah has left the door open and they hear her upstairs, screaming in ecstasy while having sex with her husband. As they scramble to sneak out, they find a remote control labeled SARAH. They do not notice that pressing a button causes Sarah's breasts to enlarge and makes her walk backwards robotically. They run away to Bobbie's messy, disorderly home. Roger confides to them that he and his husband are having marital issues and went to Stepford to get better like Bobbie (court order), Joanna (as a last resort) and their husbands. The Stepford women appear extremely vapid and shallow; in the Stepford book club, their \\"story\\" is a catalogue of Christmas, Chanukah collectibles, and decoration tips. In the Men's Association, Walter tells the other husbands that Joanna is planning to change. They show Walter that Ted's wife is a robot. Joanna and Bobbie sneak into the men's association to spy on the husbands. They discover a hall filled with family portraits and are caught by Roger. Roger tells them that there is nothing wrong and the women leave. The next day, Joanna and Bobbie discover Roger's favorite flamboyant clothes, playbills, and a photo of Orlando Bloom and a shirt with Viggo Mortensen's face in the garbage bin. Jerry tells them to meet him in the town hall and they see Roger, apparently running for State Senate, with a bland, conventional look and conformist personality. Joanna wants to leave and Walter agrees with her, saying that they will go the next day. At night, a robo-dog gives her a remote with her name. Joanne goes into Walter's study and discovers that all the Stepford wives were once working women in high power positions and that a champion terrier vanished and is believed to be the robo- dog. The next day, Joanna visits Bobbie and she notices that her house is spotless. Bobbie is now blonde, dressed in a Sunday dress, and blends in with the other Stepford wives. Bobbie says that she is a whole new person and the most important thing is her cookbook. While telling Joanna that she can help her change, Bobbie puts her hand over the stove's burner and does not even notice. Joanna wants to leave and calls the camp for her kids, but she finds out that they were taken by Walter. She goes back to the Men's Association and finds that in her family picture, she now looks like a Stepford wife. Walter has gathered with the other husbands and confesses that after marrying Joanna, he has felt undermined and all the husbands feel the same. Mike (Christopher Walken) shows how they insert nanochips into their wives' brains and turn them into Stepford wives. The men corner Joanna and Walter and force them toward the transformation room, but before Joanna enters, she makes a final appeal by asking whether the new wives really mean it when they tell their husbands that they love them. The next scene shows all of the Stepford wives, including Joanna, now blonde and dressed in Sunday dresses, at the grocery store. With Joanna and Walter as the guests of honor, Stepford hosts a formal ball. During the festivities, Joanna distracts Mike and entices him into the garden, while Walter slips away. Walter returns to the transformation room, where he destroys the software that makes the women obedient. Walter returns to the ball, where the baffled husbands are cornered by their vengeful wives. Walter reveals that Joanna never received the microchip implant because her argument during the struggle had won him over. Out of his love for and loyalty to the human being he married, he joined her plan to infiltrate Stepford, with her pretending to be a cyborg. Mike threatens Walter, but before Mike can attack, Joanna hits Mike with a candlestick, decapitating him and revealing that he is a robot, and not even partially biological. Claire (Glenn Close) explains that she created Stepford because she, too, was a bitter, career-minded woman; in her case, a tired brain surgeon. When she discovered that Mike was having an affair with her research assistant, she murdered them in a jealous rage. When Joanna wonders aloud why Claire did not simply make the men into cyborgs, she replies that she planned to turn the whole community into cyborgs. Claire then electrocutes herself by kissing Mike's severed robotic head. Six months later, Larry King is interviewing Joanna, Bobbie, and Roger, with Walter also in attendance. They have all met with success; Joanna has made a documentary, Bobbie has written a book of poetry, and Roger broke up with Jerry and won his State Senate seat as an Independent. As King asks about the fate of the other husbands of Stepford, Roger and Bobbie explain that they are still in Stepford, under house arrest, and are being retrained to become better people. The closing scene of the film reveals that the irate wives have taken over Stepford and are forcing their husbands to atone for their crimes by making them do housework and shop for them.

In a 2003 interview, Oz stated \\"Tension on the set? Absolutely! In every movie I do, there's tension. That's the whole point. And working people hard, that's exactly what they expect me to do... Bette has been under a lot of stress lately... She made the mistake of bringing her stress on the set.\\" In a 2007 interview with Ain't It Cool News, Oz's take on the film was \\"I had too much money, and I was too responsible and concerned for Paramount. I was too concerned for the producers. And I didn't follow my instincts.\\" In a 2005 interview, Matthew Broderick stated, \\"Making that film wasn't enjoyable. It was nobody's fault, but my part was not terribly interesting... It was not a thrilling film. I would hate it if it were my last.\\" The majority of the film was shot in Darien, New Canaan, and Norwalk, Connecticut. Reception Critical reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 26%, based on 172 reviews with an average rating of 4.65/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"In exchanging the chilling satire of the original into mindless camp, this remake has itself become Stepford-ized.\\" * Rolling Stone said, \\"Buzz of troubles on the set... can't compare to the mess onscreen.\\" * Entertainment Weekly said, \\"The remake is, in fact, marooned in a swamp of camp inconsequentiality.\\" * The New York Times said, \\"the movie never lives up to its satiric potential, collapsing at the end into incoherence and wishy- washy, have-it-all sentimentality.\\" Some critics were more receptive to the film. Roger Ebert called Paul Rudnick's screenplay \\"rich with zingers\\" and gave the film three stars. However, in the \\"Worst Movies of 2004\\" episode of At the Movies with Ebert and Roeper, he admitted that, while he gave the film \\"thumbs up\\", it wouldn't be \\"the first movie that [he] would defend.\\" The film's teaser won several Golden Trailer Awards, in the categories of \\"Summer 2004 Blockbuster\\" and \\"Most Original\\", as well as \\"Best of Show\\". Box office The U.S. opening weekend's gross was a respectable $21,406,781; however, sales fell off quickly and that one weekend would ultimately represent over one-third of the film's domestic gross of $59,484,742. The film grossed $42,428,452 internationally; its production budget was an estimated $100,000,000, plus a further $46,000,000 for marketing and distribution costs.

Her research has focused on the treatment of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. She is also interested in the neuroscience of consciousnessPrivate Life of the Brain (2000), susangreenfield.com; accessed 5 April 2016. and the impact of technology on the brain. Greenfield is a senior research fellow at Lincoln College, Oxford,University of Oxford> Department of Pharmacology> Baroness Susan Greenfield Accessed 12 June 2015. and was a professor of Synaptic Pharmacology. She was chancellor of Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh between 2005 and 2013. From 1998 to 2010, she was director of the Royal Institution of Great Britain. In September 2013, she co-founded the biotech company Neuro-bio Ltd, where she is Chief Executive Officer. Education Greenfield's mother, Doris (n√©e Thorp), was a dancer and a Christian, and her father, Reginald Myer Greenfield, was an electrician who was the son of a first-generation Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrant from Austria; her grandmothers never spoke and she said of them, \\"the prejudice was equally vociferous on both sides\\". She attended the Godolphin and Latymer School, where she took A levels in Latin, Greek and ancient history, and maths. The first member of her immediate family to go to university, she was initially admitted to St Hilda's College to read Philosophy and Psychology, but changed course and graduated with a first-class degree in experimental psychology. As a Senior Scholar at St Hugh's College, Oxford, she completed her DPhil degree in 1977 under the supervision of Anthony David Smith on the Origins of acetylcholinesterase in cerebrospinal fluid. She then held a junior research fellowship at Green College, Oxford between 1981 and 1984. Career Greenfield's research is focused on brain physiology, particularly on the brain mechanisms of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. She is also known for her role in popularising science. Greenfield has written several books about the brain, regularly gives public lectures, and appears on radio and television. Since 1976, Greenfield has published approximately 200 papers in peer-reviewed journals, including studies on brain mechanisms involved in addiction and reward, relating to dopamine systems and other neurochemicals. She investigated the brain mechanisms underlying attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as well as the impact of environmental enrichment. In 1994, she was the first woman to give the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, then sponsored by the BBC. Her lectures were titled \\"Journey to the centre of the brain\\". She was appointed Director of the Royal Institution in 1998.Profile , rigb.org; accessed 5 April 2016. The post was abolished in 2010. The Royal Institution had found itself in a financial crisis following a ¬£22m development programme led by Greenfield and the Board. The project ended ¬£3 million in debt. Greenfield subsequently announced that she would be taking her employers to an employment tribunal and her claim would include discrimination. The case was settled out of court. Greenfield's two main positions at Oxford were Tutorial Fellow in Medicine at Lincoln College Oxford, and Professor of Synaptic Pharmacology. Between 1995 and 1999, she gave public lectures as Gresham Professor of Physic in London. Greenfield was Adelaide's Thinker in Residence for 2004 and 2005. As a result of her recommendations, South Australian Premier Mike Rann made a major funding commitment, backed by the State and Federal Governments and the private sector, to establish the Royal Institution of Australia and the Australian Science Media Centre in Adelaide.$15m to form Royal Institution of Australia The Advertiser, 15 May 2009; accessed 10 September 2014. She has explored the relevance of neuroscience knowledge to education and has used the phrase \\"mind change\\", an umbrella term comparable to \\"climate change\\", encompassing diverse issues involved in the impact of the 21st-century environment on the brain. In 2013 she co-founded the biotech company Neuro-bio Ltd which develops diagnostic tests and therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease. The company has found that the C terminus of acetylcholinesterase can be cleaved and that the resulting peptide can kill neurons; the company has also found that a cyclic peptide analogue could prevent that neuronal death. The company raised around $4 million in 2017. Politics Greenfield in 2013 Greenfield sits in the Parliament of the United Kingdom in the House of Lords as a crossbencher, having no formal political affiliation. Records of Greenfield's activity in the House of Lords indicate abstention on a range of issues. She has spoken on a variety of topics, including education, drugs, and economic empowerment for women. Books In 2013, Greenfield published a dystopian science-fiction novel, 2121: A Tale from the Next Century, telling the story of videogame- playing hedonists and their conflict with \\"Neo-Puritans\\". In 2014, Greenfield published a popular science book called Mind Change: How Digital Technologies are Leaving their Mark on our Brains, describing her ideas about the impact of digital technology. Impact of digital technology controversy Greenfield has expressed concerns that internet usage may modify the brain structures of youngsters. She noted that Public Health England had related social networking and multiplayer online games to \\"lower levels of wellbeing\\", and believed that evidence pointed to a \\"dose response\\" relationship, \\"where each additional hour of viewing increases the likelihood of experiencing socio-emotional problems\\". She believed this raised questions about where to draw the boundaries between beneficial and harmful use of such technology, saying that \\"it would be surprising if many hours per day of screen activity did not influence this neuroplasticity\\". Honours As of 2016, Greenfield has 32 honorary degrees,Profile, theaustralian.com.au; accessed 5 April 2016. and has received awards including the Royal Society's Michael Faraday Prize. She has been elected to an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians and the London Science Museum. In 2006 she was made an Honorary Fellow of the British Science Association and was the Honorary Australian of the Year. In January 2000, Greenfield received a CBE for her contribution to the public understanding of science. Later that year, she was named Woman of the Year by The Observer. In 2001, she became a Life Peer under the House of Lords Appointments Commission system, as Baroness Greenfield, of Ot Moor, Oxfordshire. Like the other people's peers she was self-nominated. In 2003, she was appointed a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'Honneur by the French Government. In 2010 she was awarded the Australian Society for Medical Research Medal. She received the British Inspiration award for Science and Technology in 2010. Patronage She is a patron of Alzheimer's Research UK and of Dignity in Dying.

Riddick, more commonly known as Riddick, is a fictional character and the antiheroic protagonist of the Chronicles of Riddick series, including the animated short movie Dark Fury and the video games Escape from Butcher Bay and Assault on Dark Athena. Actor Vin Diesel has played the title role in all of the Riddick-based films and video games thus far. Within the canon of the series, Riddick is shown to have a vast number of skills, which include mobility, stealth, murdering, surviving, prison breaking, and piloting. Despite his criminal nature and background, he is sometimes shown to perform moral or even atypically heroic actions, usually against his own better judgment and survivalist nature. Riddick is Furyan, a member of a warrior race of adapted humans obliterated by a military campaign that left Furya desolate, and is one of the last of his kind. One of his most defining features are his eyes, a characteristic inherent in a certain caste of his species (the Alpha- Furyans), although he implies in Pitch Black that they were \\"shined\\" by a back-alley surgical operation. This allows him to see clearly in the dark, but also makes him vulnerable to strong light; he wears tinted welding goggles for protection. Riddick was once a mercenary, then part of a security force,The Chronicles of Riddick, Special Features and later a soldier. Biography  Early life Riddick was born on Furya. Before Riddick's birth, a Necromonger officer named Zhylaw (who would eventually become the Lord Marshall) consulted an Elemental seer, who told him that a Furyan male would be born that would be responsible for his downfall. This prompted Zhylaw to attack Furya and attempt to massacre all male children, going so far as to personally strangle newborn infants with their own umbilical cords. Riddick was among those presumably strangled, but he survived. In later life, Riddick repressed his memories of Furya, including those of the massacre. He came to believe that when he was born, his mother attempted to strangle him and left him in a trash bin behind a liquor store. Despite this, he periodically received visions and messages from a Furyan survivor named Shirah, which he thought were signs of mental instability. Little is known about Riddick's childhood, save that he had no formal education and seemed to have been in trouble with the law from an early age. He claims to have been \\"educated\\" in the penal system. Pitch Black In the premiere installment in the franchise, Riddick is introduced as a notorious convict en route to a penal institution with his captor, a bounty hunter named William J. Johns. By impersonating a cop and traveling with a group of settlers aboard the nondescript transport cruiser Hunter Gratzner, Johns hopes to safely convey Riddick back to a prison colony and collect the outlaw's enormous bounty. However, the ship inadvertently passes through a comet's tail while on autopilot, forcing it to crash land on an unknown planet with three suns. Soon the survivors find themselves fighting for their lives against a predatory species called Bio-Raptors, and by the end of the film there are only three survivors: Riddick, a young girl called Jack, and Imam. Dark Fury Shortly after escaping the planet from Pitch Black, Riddick, Jack, and the Imam are picked up by a Mercenary spacecraft. Although Riddick attempts to conceal his identity from the mercenaries by impersonating William J. Johns (in Pitch Black) over the intercom, they quickly voice-print and identify him. Captured by the mercenaries, the trio of survivors discover that their captors have unusual plans for Riddick. The ship's owner, Antonia Chillingsworth, collects criminals, whom she freezes and keeps as statues that are, in her view, art. Although the criminals are frozen, they are alive and conscious. To her Riddick is the ultimate \\"masterpiece\\" for her collection. Riddick, Jack, and Imam must fight their way through the army of human and alien creatures at her disposal or they will meet a fate crueler than death. Once they have killed most of the mercs on the ship, the trio takes one of Antonia's shuttles and head for New Mecca (although at one point the navicomp shows a potential course for Furya), where Riddick leaves them before heading for the planet UV 6. The Chronicles of Riddick Five years later, Riddick has remained in hiding on an Arctic planet called U.V. for its harsh Ultraviolet light. Meanwhile, Imam, learning that his own planet, Helion Prime, will be invaded by the twisted religious crusade of the Necromongers, recalls the story Riddick told him of his Furyan origins, and betrays Riddick's location to the Helion Prime leaders. Initially, Riddick is reluctant to become involved in the struggle between the Necromongers and the world they seek to conquer. But when Imam is killed, Riddick sets out on a mission to avenge him, eventually overthrowing the Lord Marshal (with help from Jack) and inheriting his office.simply read original article and watched the series Riddick Dissatisfied with his role as Lord Marshal, Riddick attempts to find Furya, but is instead abandoned on a desolate planet. After spending some time on this world, Riddick finds that he will soon be overtaken by a vicious storm that provides cover for countless predators. Using the communication system from a mercenary outpost, Riddick lures two ships to the planet, intending to commandeer one of them; but his plan is complicated when he finds that one of the arriving mercenaries is the father of his old enemy, Johns the bounty hunter. Riddick uses the approaching storm to force the mercenaries to cooperate, but he is left surrounded by enemies and nearly killed. To his surprise, the elder Johns rescues him and allows him to leave. Riddick praises Johns for being a better man than his son. Powers and abilities Eyeshine According to Riddick, while in Butcher Bay he received eye surgery (a \\"surgical shine job\\", as he calls it) from a doctor who gave him permanent night vision in exchange for \\"20 menthol KOOLs\\". The surgery made his eyes more sensitive to normal light, requiring him to wear welding goggles to protect them (although he has also been shown without the goggles in a regularly illuminated room). In the flash movie on the Pitchblack.com website, Riddick gets the eye-shine to give him more of an advantage following an encounter with humanoids called \\"shiners\\". Referring to Riddick as \\"darkeye\\", they have had the same operation to see in the dark bowels of the Ursa Luna prison where the guards do not tend to go. The eye-shine surgery seems to be performed by a bovine veterinarian on board a prison facility where Riddick arrived only a few hours before and from which he is already in the process of escaping. Riddick elects to have no anesthetic, despite the procedure involving cutting the cornea and drilling through the eye to inject a reflective substance behind the retina. The cost quoted to Riddick is 1000 creds. Having no cash, Riddick offers down payment of a pack of Kool cigarettes which he earlier took from a guard. He also takes some welder's goggles from the facility. The video game, The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay (which serves as a prequel to Pitch Black), clarifies that Riddick's eyeshine is more than just something he picked up in a prison. After helping a character called \\"Pope Joe\\" retrieve his \\"blessed voice box\\", a radio that picks up religious programming (including a Necromonger Talk Show), Riddick goes into a den to get stitches for an injury. After he is finished receiving stitches, Joe tells him how to escape, and, perhaps coincidentally, warns Riddick not to \\"trust [his] eyes\\"; at that moment, a ghostly voice informs Riddick that he has \\"been blind for far too long...\\" and that he is to receive a gift. It is at this moment that Riddick receives his eyeshine. The mysterious voice belongs to a character named \\"Shirah\\", who appears to serve as a sort of spiritual guide to Riddick, helping him awaken the Furyan abilities that lie dormant within him. In the Chronicles of Riddick film, Jack/Kyra angrily tells Riddick that when she was sent to prison, she found out that it is impossible to find anyone who can perform a \\"surgical shine job\\" at any price, and accuses him of lying about how he received his night vision. Light amplification surgery, somewhat similar in effect to Riddick's eyeshine, has been patented in real life.New Scientist - Vision AmplifierMETHOD FOR STIMULATING RETINAL RESPONSE USING PHOTOACTIVE DEVICES Wrath of the Furyans Aside from helping Riddick unlock his eyeshine, the character Shirah also either allows or helps Riddick discover his ability to unleash a sort of energy wave. It is shown in the director's cut of The Chronicles of Riddick after she lays her hand on Riddick's chest, leaving a glowing blue hand print, and says, \\"this mark carries the anger of an entire race... but it's going to hurt\\". After either receiving a shot from Vaako's energy handgun or a fraction of a second before the discharge of said weapon, she immediately emits a large blast of blue energy from Riddick (or Riddick himself does so with her guidance), leaving the group of surrounding Necromongers dead. This ability is also displayed off screen in Escape from Butcher Bay. Physical abilities Aside from his more supernatural skills, Riddick is in superlative physical condition and is an exceptional fighter with or without the use of his eyes. Whether as a result of his Furyan heritage or simply training, Riddick is stronger, faster, more agile, tougher, more resistant to damage and injury, possessing more acute senses, immense stamina, and superior healing when compared to most humans; he is shown on more than one occasion dislocating his limbs for brief moments with only slight signs of discomfort, although he was in more obvious pain when his leg was broken in a fall, and had to use a heated rock to cauterize a wound when he was impaled in the chest by a creature's sharpened tooth. In general, Riddick possesses an abnormally high threshold of pain and psychologically channels what pain he does feel into anger. His ability to cope with toxins is also heightened; when a merc team was attempting to take him out with horse tranquilizers, it took four darts just to make Riddick stop running, and he still remained conscious until he was hit in the head. His ability to cope with pain, stress and situational panic is most likely the main reason behind his success, which combined with his sharp intelligence gives Riddick the ability to escape from any situation. Riddick's abilities at hand-to-hand combat is a mix of Krav Maga, Hapkido, Eskrima, and Ninjutsu; he uses his formidable fighting skills while confronting one of the night-creatures of Pitch Black with only his bare hands and a shiv he had made, killing it with relative ease, as well as defeating one of the Lord Marshal's best Necromonger warriors in a matter of seconds in Chronicles. Also, he was able to hold off the Lord Marshal and even injure him which the Lord Marshal admitted hadn't happened in a long time. While Riddick was no match for him in speed, he was able to hold off the Lord Marshal for several minutes. Intelligence Despite his harsh upbringing and violent attitude, Riddick has been shown to have a certain knack for deduction, rapidly deducing what had happened to the original inhabitants of the mining base where he and the other crash survivors had been staying, as well as finding the creature's blind spot in Pitch Black and swiftly deducing what had caused the firefight between the Warden's and Toombs' men in The Chronicles of Riddick. He has also been described as having \\"a knack for escape\\", surviving not only the Lord Marshall's purge of the Furyans when he was an infant but subsequently escaping from various prisons over the course of his life. He is also able to quickly judge the quality of, and find even seemingly minor flaws in most weaponry, down to very specific details. In one case, Riddick concluded that the prized dagger of a Necromonger was \\"a half gram too heavy on the back end\\" after an inspection lasting all of a couple of seconds, although the tone of voice in which he delivered this appraisal suggested pre-fight bravado rather than abstract fact. His only weakness (other than light sensitivity, leaving him in pain when in daylight without his goggles), as stated in the Pitch Black DVD, is his soft spot for children and anyone who really grows on him (those people become his friends), which resulted in his capture by the bounty hunter Johns (Cole Hauser). While he may be a ruthless killer when necessary, Riddick has never been shown to kill anyone who was not actively trying to kill him first, and has been known to help people in need only if they don't slow him down or make him vulnerable. The only exception to this was when, in Pitch Black, he returned with Carolyn to help the others, after she pleaded with him. He also mentions on board the Dark Athena that people he helps often end up dead. In The Chronicles of Riddick, he considered it an insult, when he discovered the bounty placed on him was around a million of the currency for most planets, and when Toombs has a small crew to capture him (it was originally four crew members, then it was five). In addition to raw analytical power, Riddick is generally an astute judge of character, especially in the dark side of human nature. A killer himself and resident of several maximum security facilities, he is often able to predict an individual's negative impulses before they act on them. He has been known to be surprised on occasion, such as when Carolyn Fry in Pitch Black altruistically gave up a fast escape to save Jack and Imam from the alien creatures. Riddick was also surprised when he underestimated Jack's (Kyra's) affection toward him between Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick, only learning of it after she had become a mercenary and resident of a maximum security prison in order to see him once again. Otherwise, he correctly predicted which of the group in Pitch Black would turn on each other (in particular that Johns would try to double-cross Fry), and that the mercs and guards on Crematoria would turn on each other prior to his escape attempt. In Riddick, he appeared pleasantly surprised to learn that Johns' father was a better man than his son, complimenting Johns' nerve when he came back to help Riddick when he didn't have to. Willpower One major characteristic of Riddick is his indomitable will. Despite finding himself in situations where the odds of survival and/or escape would seem insurmountable, Riddick always pushes forward and never gives up. Faced with several creatures far more powerful than himself, or any human for that matter, he has shown himself to be capable of evading, killing, or even taming them. He has escaped out of prisons when most prisoners would resign themselves to captivity. When Riddick was mentally probed by the Quasi-Dead of the Necromongers, he not only resisted them, but also retaliated, the Quasi-Dead's containers actually exploding from the strain of trying to process Riddick. Given the Necromongers' apparent faith in and respect for the power of the Quasi-Dead, this is a very impressive feat. Perhaps even greater was his ability to resist the Lord Marshall's attempt to steal his soul. The one time his will seemed to waver was when Kyra was killed, sacrificing herself to save him and help him defeat the Lord Marshal, and even then he channeled his loss into new strength. Weapons Riddick is deadly with any weapon that he can get his hands on, but his weapon of choice is undoubtedly a knife. However, Riddick's most famous weapons are surely a pair of Ulak blades that he is seen using during his escape from Crematoria in The Chronicles of Riddick. He has also been known to use anything from Necromonger gravity rifles, teacups and anything in between. Riddick can also kill efficiently without using a weapon. In the second film, he used the knife he took from Irgun as his weapon during his fight with him and the Lord Marshall, killing both with it. The third film sees him predominately relying on a bone-sword he made from the remains of a creature he had killed. Other appearances Riddick's first appearance outside Pitch Black was a guest appearance and potential recruit in Fallout Tactics. He appears in the game during a random special encounter, aptly titled Pitch Black. Like his movie origin, Riddick is a stealth focused melee fighter with advanced hand-to-hand fighting skills and the ability to see in the dark. Riddick has appeared as a playable character in the Xbox game Deathrow. He is one of the final players available on the Convicts team and has the highest amount of strength and aggression of all recruitable Convict players, although he has the equal-lowest teamplay rating in the game. Behind the scenes Richard B. Riddick first appeared in Pitch Black: Slam City, a Shockwave prequel comic on the official Pitch Black website, one month before the release of the movie. In the film, and in all subsequent appearances the character has been portrayed by Vin Diesel. In Jim and Ken Wheat's original script for Pitch Black, the Riddick character was a woman named Taras Krieg.

He is the founder of Hyatt Legal Services, in which capacity he became a household name for many years, as he was featured in his firm's nationwide television commercials which always ended with the slogan, \\"I'm Joel Hyatt and you have my word on it.\\" Hyatt is also co-founder of Current TV. Life and career Hyatt graduated from Dartmouth College and Yale Law School. He briefly practiced law as an associate at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. Hyatt co-founded Hyatt Legal Services in 1977 as a low- cost legal service, making legal services available to millions of hitherto disenfranchised middle- and lower-class Americans. He later founded Hyatt Legal Plans, which became the country's largest provider of employer-sponsored group legal services, pioneering the concept of Legal Services as a fringe benefit (provided in the same manner as, for example, dental insurance). Hyatt Legal Plans was acquired by MetLife in 1997. Hyatt was a founding member of the U.S. Senate Democratic Leadership Circle and was a member of that group from 1981 to 1986. He was the Democratic National Committee's assistant treasurer from 1981 to 1983. He is the son-in-law of former U.S. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-OH), functioning as campaign manager on Metzenbaum's first two successful bids for the Senate. In 1994, when Metzenbaum decided to retire from the Senate, Hyatt ran to replace him. Hyatt won the Democratic nomination, but lost to then Lieutenant Governor Michael DeWine in the general election in a campaign year in which Republicans swept all twelve of the Senate vacancies and unseated many incumbents. In 1990, Hyatt Legal Services paid a $157,000 settlement for having illegally fired an attorney in their Philadelphia offices, Clarence B. Cain, in reference to his AIDS diagnosis. Some attribute to this case the premise for the 1993 film Philadelphia, alongside the more renowned Geoffrey Bowers case three-years prior. Hyatt is known to have expressed his disappointment in his own firm's handling of the case, and of its treatment of Mr. Cain. Hyatt was appointed to the California Public Utilities Commission in June 1999, by Governor Gray Davis. He served six months of a six-year term, resigning in December 1999. Hyatt served as National Finance Chair for the Democratic party in 2000, and is a business partner of former U.S. Vice President Al Gore In 2004, Hyatt and Gore purchased Newsworld International, a cable news channel, programmed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which aired news programming from around the world. On August 1, 2005, Gore and Hyatt relaunched the network as Current TV, a young adult-programmed news and information service which pioneered the concept of user generated content on cable TV. Hyatt and Gore later sold the channel to Al Jazeera Media Network on January 2, 2013 for a reported $500 million. In August, 2014, Hyatt and Gore sued Al Jazeera for fraud and breach of contract in connection with a residual payment of $65 million that remained unpaid. The allegations were denied by Al Jazeera as \\"blatantly false\\" and \\"potentially misleading.\\" Hyatt taught entrepreneurship at Stanford University Graduate School of Business from 1998 to 2003 and at Stanford Law school.

It was Holden's version of GM's J-body family of cars‚ÄîGM's third \\"global\\" car platform. The name \\"Camira\\" comes from an Aboriginal word meaning \\"wind.\\" After an initial good sales run, Camira sales dropped significantly and the model was discontinued in 1989. The Holden Apollo, a rebadged Toyota Camry was introduced as the Australian market replacement, with New Zealand instead offering the European-sourced Opel Vectra. In all 151,807 Camiras were built (85,725 JBs; 36,953 JDs; and 29,129 JEs).Jeeves (2008), p. 197. __TOC__  JB (1982‚Äì1984)  JB Camira SLX sedan (Australia) JB Camira SL/X wagon (New Zealand) The original Camira, the JB series, was introduced in 1982 with a major trans-Tasman marketing campaign. The Camira replaced the Sunbird and Torana, although an interim four-cylinder version of the Commodore bridged the two-year production gap.. A station wagon version was introduced the following year, and its bodywork was exported to Vauxhall in the United Kingdom for the Cavalier wagon.Autocar, Volume 209, 1996, page 13 Some Camiras were also exported to right-hand drive markets in Southeast Asia, such as Indonesia and Singapore. The wagon variant was specifically a Holden design, which Holden insisted should be part of the overall \\"J-car\\" program. A five-door hatchback, based on the Opel Ascona/Vauxhall Cavalier \\"J-car\\" was proposed for the Camira, but never made it to the production stage due to Holden's financial losses at that time. There was only one engine, the carburettored, naturally aspirated, transversely mounted 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine delivering . The transaxle offering was a four-speed manual on the SL and SL/X, with a five-speed unit specified to SJ and SL/E variants. A three-speed automatic was optional on all models. Power steering was optional from early 1984 The Camira was Wheels magazine's Car of the Year for 1982. While superior to most other cars of the day in terms of ride and handling, the 1.6-litre Family II (16LF) engine, marketed as Camtech, was regarded as \\"underpowered\\" by much of the motoring media. While partly true, the powerplant produced similar power levels to many of its rivals, although the actual power delivery differed. Unlike traditional Australian engines that had reserves of low down torque, the Camira required a very different driving style that involved revving the engine. Early models of the Camira suffered from a litany of quality control problems, which included smoking engines, insufficient drainage holes in the doors, poor paint quality and lack of adequate fan cooling, resulting in overheating in JB Camiras fitted with air conditioning. This tarnished the Camira's reputation and led to its withdrawal from the New Zealand market, where a rebadged version of the Isuzu Aska, known as the JJ Camira, was sold instead. There are several models within the JB range that are seen as \\"more desirable\\" and were produced in very limited numbers.These are the Formular & SJ in sedans only. There were also some modified by the Country Dealer Team Performance Vehicle company based in Victoria. These JB's were available in 3 versions. All had full fibreglass body kits and mag wheels (S1). The S2 had a full range of options. The 1.6 engines were modified with extractors, Weber carbie and the S3 was fitted with a turbo charger. They also have very distinctive decals. There was very limited Camira produced. CDT versions are seen as the rarest and most desirable. Gemini & Commodore were also available  Specification levels  * SL: entry-level variant, with no air conditioning or power steering, though it is possible to find some with dealer-fitted air conditioning. * SJ : sporty version based on SL with a five- speed manual transmission. Other changes constrained to cosmetic upgrades. Available in three colours - Electron Blue, Super Maranello Red and Quasar Orange. * SL/X: received several additional extras over SL including cloth trim, extra chrome, and other cosmetic upgrades. * SL/E: top-of-the-line model with richer trim, full instrumentation, and alloy wheels as standard. These alloy wheels were styled similarly to those of the VH Commodore SL/E wheels (but using a four spoke/four stud design rather than the Commodore's five). Despite being available in all other \\"J-car\\" models, power windows were not available in the Australian Camira models until the JE version. However air conditioning and cruise control were optional, as was a trip computer.  JD (1984‚Äì1987)  The second series JD Camira, released in 1984 received a facelift, with a more aerodynamic front-end and the absence of a conventional front grille. The differences were not only cosmetic, the engine was upgraded from 1.6 to a multi-point fuel injected 1.8-litre on the SL/X and SL/E models (the 1.6-litre remained for the SL). These changes combined allowed the engine to deliver . The new 1.8-litre engine was mated with a close ratio five-speed manual transmission, as opposed to the four-speed fitted to the 1.6. In mid-1986 new emissions regulations required that all cars manufactured in Australia run on unleaded petrol. Firstly, Holden dropped the base 1.6-litre engine. For the 1.8-litre, Holden was forced to engineer another reworking of the engine (all variants prior to this ran on leaded petrol), during which time Holden was operating at a loss. The result was that Holden dropped the multi-point injection for the 1.8-litre and reverted to single-point, akin to a carburettor, and altered the tuning of the engine to suit. A power-robbing catalytic converter was fitted, and power output was reduced by to . This engine was also used in Holden's locally manufactured compact car, the LD Astra (1987‚Äì1989), a badge engineered Nissan Pulsar (N13; 1987‚Äì1991), as well as the Pulsar itself. This was the result of a model sharing alliance between Holden and Nissan at the time, where the Nissan body was used in conjunction with GM powertrains. Running on unleaded petrol, this engine had an output of . The Pulsar's 1.8-litre engine contained the same basic internals as the JD Camira's 1.8-litre engine, with the main exception being the block casting and smaller ports/valves on the head, and smaller intake manifold. Both the Camira and Astra/Pulsar engines were powered by a Delco Electronics engine control unit. This caused problems of its own, as with age, the fine tolerance of the circuitry and componentry have a tendency to fail unexpectedly, and on failing, the engine will cease to operate, or operate with a crippling loss of power due to incorrect tuning and fuel delivery. The external engine mounts are better placed on the Pulsar, and hence result in longer engine mount life.  Specification levels  * SL, SL/X, and SL/E: as for JB. * Executive: introduced in 1986 as an option pack for the SL/X. The Executive was first seen on the VK Commodore in 1984. * Formula: first seen on the JD model, the Formula pack was optional to any model which had special pin striping and side skirts, this pack sold in limited numbers.

This consisted of two entirely different J-cars: the sedan version was a rebadged version of the Isuzu Aska from Japan. This decision was made by General Motors New Zealand as sales figures of the Camira JB were poor for this market, however the wagon version which was built and sold in Australia was retained and assembled locally. File:1985 Holden Camira 2.0L Saloon (7151739709).jpgHolden Camira (JJ) sedan File:1984-1987 Holden Camira (JJ) sedan 02.jpgHolden Camira (JJ) sedan  JE (1987‚Äì1989)  Released in April 1987, the JE was the final series of Camira.Norm Darwin, 100 Years of GM in Australia, 2002, page 352 By this time, many of the Camira's early quality problems had been overcome, and Holden now fitted the multi- point fuel-injected 2.0-litre engine to replace the 1.8-litre unit. The 2.0-litre unit delivered at 5200 rpm and of torque at 3200 rpm. The automatic transaxle in the JE, the Turbo-Hydramatic 125 C, sported a lockup torque converter. Styling changes were minor from the JD with the addition of a thin grille up front, revised bonnet, larger 14-inch wheels and new wheel trims. After Camira production wound up during 1989, Holden replaced the Camira with the Apollo, a rebadged Toyota Camry, a result of the Button car plan introduced by the Australian Government, which encouraged a reduction in the number of Australian car-makers and models.The Bulletin, Volumes 109-110, page 20 General Motors New Zealand was not affected by this scheme and instead replaced the Camira with the European-sourced Opel Vectra, which after 1994 was rebadged as the Holden Vectra. Holden continued to produce the Family II engine for export well after the Camira was discontinued. Over three million variants were produced, in 1.6-, 1.8- and 2.0-litre configurations, with the 1.8- and 2.0-litre variants being fuel injected.  Specification levels  * SL, SLX, Executive, SLE: as for JB and JD series, except the SLX and SLE nameplates no longer featured the \\"/\\" symbol, as in SL/X. * Vacationer: was a special edition, based on the Executive, painted light blue metallic (an HT Monaro colour) with red and white decals, SLX trim, and SLE roof racks (wagons). * SLi 2000: was unique to the JE, being a \\"sports\\" package based on the SLX. Major differences were the addition of side skirts, a small spoiler and distinctive orange and silver pin striping. In somewhat of a marketing ploy, the SLi was only available in red (although one report of a white 1988 SLi 2000 purchased from new exists in NZ) in the sedan body shell with a five- speed manual transaxle, and with a grey interior from the SLX. Despite its sports-oriented nature, the SLi 2000 was powered by the same Family II engine fitted to all other JEs, hence providing no extra performance. * Formula: was, like the SLi 2000, and could be optioned across the entire sedan range. Skirting and pin striping were also options. Buyers did have the freedom to choose the colour, however all versions had manual transmission and \\"Formula\\" headrest inserts. The Vacationer, SLi 2000 and the Formula were sold in limited numbers and are subsequently rare today, as were cars built with power windows, central locking and automatic boot lid releases.

On wagon models, rust usually occurred in the bottom of the rear door due to inadequate water drainage. * Models equipped with a manual transmission had a firewall cracking problem, because the clutch mount tore the firewall mounting structure. This was easily rectified or prevented early on, but advanced stages of cracking were difficult to repair due to the awkward location and the need to weld. * On models fitted with an automatic transmission, the lockup torque converter switch malfunctioned, keeping the torque converter locked in third gear when slowing down and stalling the engine when the car came to standstill. This was due to the poor durability of the plastic switch. * The engine control unit was notorious for problems. Cracks in the printed circuit board often caused the engine to stall at speed if the board bent, for instance through heat expansion. * Engine mount breakages were known to occur, especially when the car was driven roughly. This problem was particularly evident in the later fuel injected engines, because the increased engine power correspondingly increased the stress on the Camira's rubber engine mounts. * The water manifold at the rear of the engine was made of hard polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and splits could occur after many heating and cooling cycles, resulting in a loss of engine coolant. * The cylinder head was prone to warping, especially when the car was driven frequently. This problem was more pronounced in the later fuel injected models, due to increased engine temperatures and greater stress on that component. * The JB and early JD which were carburettor equipped, suffered from premature failure of the \\"sandwich mount\\" located between the carburettor and intake manifold. * The instrument panel gauges and their fascias would crack and buckle when exposed to continual sunlight and hot days, more than most makes and models. * The alloy optional wheels on upgrade models, had very sharp internal surfaces, precluding the possibility of fitting inner tubes to rectify any air leaks/punctures. * models with power steering had issues with power steering pumps being beneath the engine which were easily damaged driving over speed bumps.  Safety  The Used Car Safety Ratings, published in 2008 by the Monash University Accident Research Centre, found that 1982‚Äì1989 Holden Camiras provide a \\"significantly worse than average\\" level of safety in the event of an accident, in a comparison to other \\"medium cars\\". The safety rating was not calculated solely on the basis of the protection of the vehicle's occupants, but also included protection for \\"cyclists, pedestrians and drivers of other vehicles\\" to give a \\"better guide to the total community impact of vehicle safety.\\"  Notes   References  *  External links  * Camira Cars introduced in 1982 1980s cars Cars of Australia Front-wheel-drive vehicles Mid-size cars Sedans Station wagons ","title":"Holden Camira"},{"id":"709355","text":"The Carson Sink Case is a UFO incident alleged by John L. McGinn and John R. Barton, two United States Air Force Colonels, to have taken place near Carson Sink in western Nevada in the United States while they were en route from California to Colorado in a B-25 on July 24, 1952. Both colonels worked at the Pentagon at the time with assignments that would have made them very familiar with military aircraft of the era, both domestic and foreign. The aircraft were also reported as being seen by hundreds of residents. Event A B-25 flying over Poland.On July 24, 1952, two Air Force colonels requisitioned a twin-engine B-25 bomber at Hamilton Field north of San Francisco for a flight to Colorado Springs, Colorado. At 3:40 P.M. Mountain Time, while flying at with a speed of over Carson Sink, the two pilots saw three unknown aircraft ahead of them and to their right. At first, the two thought the aircraft were F-86 jets but determined that the aircraft were flying too high for that to be the case. On top of this, the pilots reported the aircraft to be flying in a V-formation, which was abnormal for military aircraft at the time. Within seconds, the aircraft had come close enough to the B-25 that the pilots could determine the unidentified aircraft to be bright silver, delta wing aircraft that were lacking tails and pilot's canopies. The colonels also reported that the aircraft had a ridge that ran from nose to tail. The aircraft then made a sharp left turn, passing within of the B-25 before flying off in what the pilots estimated to be a speed that was three-times the speed of an F-86, placing them out of sight within four seconds. Upon landing in Colorado Springs, the pilots reported the incident to Air Defense Command headquarters, who told them that no civilian or military aircraft had been anywhere near Carson Sink at the time they were passing over the area. The closest known delta wing aircraft were on the West Coast at the time. On top of this, the Navy aircraft were painted to be dark blue. Aftermath Air Defense Command reported the incident to Project Blue Book, but it remained unexplained. In his subsequent book, The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, Edward Ruppelt characterized it as a \\"good UFO report with an unknown conclusion\\". Both pilots continued to dismiss the idea that the aircraft were F-86s. The investigation also looked into balloons, both weather balloons and research balloons that can be up to wide, but there were no known balloons in the area, either. Both of the pilots had friends who themselves had reported flying saucers. McGinn and Barton expressed skepticism of these reports previous to the incident, but upon being interviewed in Colorado Springs they reported they had changed their opinions.

In other words, it is a racket that sells security, traditionally physical security but now also computer security. Through the credible threat of violence, the racketeers deter people from swindling, robbing, injuring, sabotaging or otherwise harming their clients. Protection rackets tend to appear in markets in which the police and judiciary cannot be counted on to provide legal protection, because of incompetence (as in weak or failed states) or illegality (black markets). Protection rackets are indistinguishable in practice from extortion rackets and distinguishable from private security by some degree of implied threat that the racketeers themselves may attack the business if it fails to pay for their protection. A distinction is possible between a \\"pure\\" extortion racket in which the racketeers might agree only not to attack a business and a broader protection racket offering some real private security in addition to such extortion. The criminals might agree to defend a business from any attack by either themselves or third parties (other criminal gangs). However, in reality, that distinction is doubtful, because extortion racketeers may have to defend their clients against rival gangs to maintain their profits. By corollary, criminal gangs may have to maintain control of territories (turfs), as local businesses may collapse if forced to pay for protection from too many rackets, which then hurts all parties involved. Certain scholars, such as Diego Gambetta, classify criminal organizations engaged in protection racketeering as \\"mafia\\", as the racket is popular with both the Sicilian Mafia and Italian-American Mafia. Overview A protection racket is an operation where criminals provide protection to persons and properties, settle disputes and enforce contracts in markets where the police and judicial system cannot be relied upon. Gambetta's The Sicilian Mafia (1996) and Varese's The Russian Mafia (2001) define the mafia as a type of organized crime group that specializes in the provision of private protection. Protection racketeers or mafia groups operate mostly in the black market, providing buyers and sellers the security they need for smooth transactions; but empirical data collected by Gambetta and Varese suggests that mafia groups are able to offer private protection to corporations and individuals in legal markets when the state fails to offer sufficient and efficient protection to the people in need. Two elements distinguish racketeers from legal security firms. The first element is their willingness to deploy violent forms of retribution (going as far as premeditated murder) that fall outside the limits the law normally extends to civilian security firms. The other element is that racketeers are willing to involve themselves in illegal markets. Recent studies show that mafia groups or gangs are not the only form of protection racket or extra-legal protector, and another important form of protection racket is corrupt networks consisting of public officials, especially those from criminal justice agencies. For example, Wang's The Chinese Mafia (2017) examines protection rackets in China and suggests two types of extra-legal protectors, namely the Black Mafia (local gangs) and the Red Mafia (networks of corrupt government officials). Wang's narrative suggests that local gangs are quasi law enforcers in both legal and illegal markets, and corrupt public officials are extra-legal protectors, safeguarding local gangs, protecting illegal entrepreneurs in the criminal underworld, offering protection to businesspeople, and selling public appointments to buyers. Territorial monopolies A protection racketeer cannot tolerate competition within his sphere of influence from another racketeer. If a dispute erupted between two clients (e.g. businessmen competing for a construction contract) who are protected by rival racketeers, the two racketeers would have to fight each other to win the dispute for their respective clients. The outcomes of such fights can be unpredictable, and neither racketeer would be able to guarantee a victory for his client. This would make their protection unreliable and of little value; their clients would likely dismiss them and settle the dispute by other means. Therefore, racketeers negotiate territories in which they can monopolize the use of violence in settling disputes. These territories may be geographical, or they may be a certain type of business or form of transaction. Providing genuine protection Sometimes racketeers will warn other criminals that the client is under their protection and that they will punish anyone who harms the client. Services that the racketeers may offer may include the recovery of stolen property or punishing vandals. The racketeers may even advance the interests of the client by forcing out (or otherwise hindering or intimidating) unprotected competitors. Protection from theft and vandalism is one service the racketeer may offer. For instance, in Sicily, mafiosi know all the thieves and fences in their territory, and can track down stolen goods and punish thieves who attack their clients. Protection racketeers establish what they hope will be indefinitely long bonds with their clients. This allows the racketeers to publicly declare a client to be under their protection. Thus, thieves and other predators will have little confusion as to who is and is not protected. Protection racketeers are not necessarily criminals. In A Short History of Progress, Ronald Wright notes on p.49, \\"The warrior caste, supposedly society's protectors, often become protection racketeers. In times of war or crisis, power is easily stolen from the many by the few on a promise of security. The more elusive or imaginary the foe, the better for manufacturing consent.\\" Examples *During the late medieval and early modern era in the Scottish Marches, local farmers would often need to make payments to the Border Reivers as a form of protection money to ensure they were not attacked. These agreements were called \\"Black mal\\", where \\"mal\\" was an Old Norse word meaning agreement. The word blackmail entered the English language in 1530 as a result, but the word's meaning has changed since. *In Melbourne, Australia, Alphonse Gangitano ran a protection racket along the famous Lygon Street during the 1990s. *In Sicily, Italy, officials say that 80% of businesses in the city of Palermo pay pizzo, or protection money, to the Sicilian Mafia. *In Ciudad Ju√°rez, Mexico, when the Mexican Drug War escalated in 2008, criminal groups like the Ju√°rez Cartel saw their financial backbone threatened and began asking for protection money from businesses ranging from convenience stores to clubs and restaurants with the threat of burning down the business, kidnapping the owners or killing everyone inside with assault rifles.El Diario de Juarez - Suben 57% denuncias por extorsiones 10 August 2009 *In the early history of post-Soviet Russia, law enforcement was too underfunded and poorly trained to protect businesses and enforce contracts.

Payment may also show up indirectly in the form of a campaign contribution. Stopping governments agencies as a whole, and buying protection in the government is called regulatory capture.

This is in contrast to mutations, which are changes in the genomes of organisms. Environmental differences that can affect an organism's characteristics (phenotype) include substrate, light, warmth, stress, exercise, and so on. Modifications are typically not heritable, however in some cases epigenetic modifications can be inherited. In both cases, there is no change to the primary DNA sequence (genotype), rather an influence on gene expression which is the cause of the altered phenotype. Modifiability In ideal heredity, the genes of the parents are passed on to their offspring unchanged. That is why the organisms which carry the same genotype should be identical in every feature. However, this is not the case. Due to environmental conditions they can mutate, resulting in variation of organisms from each other up to a certain point. There are two types of modifications: the continuous modification and the switching modification. To illustrate the modifiability you can take a look at our cultivated plants. The harvest of those plants do not only depend on the quality of the seeds but also greatly on environmental factors like the condition of the soil, the nutrient content of the soil, the fertilization, the humidity and temperature as well as the interference of other plants. Genetic engineering is a type of intentional genetic modification, which uses biotechnology to alter an organism's genome. This type of modification can involve insertions or deletions of DNA bases into the existing genetic code.  Methods  Image depicts the CRISPR genome editing process. This image depicts the general method of biotechnological genome editing using bacterial vectors. Genetic modifications can occur naturally, through aforementioned mutations that can occur in an organism's genome, or through biotechnological methods of selecting a gene of interest to manipulate. In biotechnological methodology, the first step is to identify a trait of interest. The next step is to compare genomes of organisms in the same species, with and without the trait, to isolate the sequence of the specific trait of interest. The third step is to utilize the sequence and various enzymes to insert the trait's genes into a plasmid vector, which can then be inserted into bacteria to propagate the preferable gene. The following steps mainly consist of researchers testing the organism to ensure that the trait was transmitted successfully, and that no detriments are caused to the organism due to the new modification. CRISPR methods are a specific variation of the aforementioned process of genome editing, which is the most accepted method, today. Examples This image shows an example of genetic modification utilized for agricultural benefits. In the example of the dandelion: most have long stems, but some have adapted to their environment by genetically modifying the stem length to be much shorter; to avoid being cut by lawnmowers. Because the shorter-stemmed dandelions had the genetic strength of living past the long-stemmed dandelions, the genetic frequency of a population can be altered, and thereby genetically modified. In a synthetic example in a laboratory, scientists isolated the gene that caused Alzheimer's in humans, the Amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, and transmitted it into the nerve cells of worms. In doing this, scientists aimed to study the progression of Alzheimer's disease in worms by tagging the APP protein, so that scientists could visualize it as the worm aged; the ultimate goal was to apply their new understandings of the APP gene and its role in Alzheimer's disease to human research. Insulin that humans inject for medical need is the first medical use of genetically modified bacteria, and an example of a product of synthetic genetic modification. Through the following steps, scientists are able to genetically engineer a medical product that millions of people rely on worldwide: # A small piece of DNA is extracted from a circular form of bacterial or yeast DNA called a plasmid. A scientist will extract this DNA through using specific restriction enzymes. # Then, a scientist will insert the human gene for insulin into the gap left by the extracted DNA. This plasmid is now considered a genetically modified entity. # Then, the genetically modified entity is reintroduced into a new bacterial or yeast cell. # This cell will then undergo mitosis and divide rapidly, producing insulin suitable for human needs. # Scientists grow the genetically modified bacteria or yeast in large fermentation vessels, which contain all of their necessary nutrients, and allow large amounts of insulin to be cultivated. # When fermentation is complete, the mixture is filtered to produce the final the insulin. # The insulin is then purified and packaged into bottles and insulin pens for distribution to patients with diabetes.  Ethics  Ethical considerations regarding gene editing are largely controversial in society. The scientific community generally advocates on the side of caution when it comes to whether or not to utilize genome-edited organisms in everyday life. As aforementioned, genetic modifications are studied by researchers under controlled conditions after they are inserted into an organism, which allows for enhancement of the scientific understanding of the effects of certain gene modifications and certain organism responses, and can then be translated into more generalized research for further understanding. Scientists and policymakers are in agreement that public deliberations should decide the legality of germ line genome editing. The ethical issues of genetic modifications are highly debated, and there are many arguments that can be considered legitimate on both sides. A major argument over the accepted ethics for genetic modifications includes whether the genetic modifications are safe for humans and our environment to endure. While some individuals infer that if genetically modified organisms are tested under controlled laboratory conditions and ensured to be safe, then they will be safe for all purposes; other individuals feel that if genetically modified organisms are unnatural, then they will automatically cause detriment to our society, or they have uncertain potential for harm.

It is a form of partitioning cryptanalysis that exploits unevenness in how the cipher operates over equivalence classes (congruence classes) modulo n. The method was first suggested in 1999 by John Kelsey, Bruce Schneier, and David Wagner and applied to RC5P (a variant of RC5) and M6 (a family of block ciphers used in the FireWire standard). These attacks used the properties of binary addition and bit rotation modulo a Fermat prime. Mod 3 analysis of RC5P For RC5P, analysis was conducted modulo 3. It was observed that the operations in the cipher (rotation and addition, both on 32-bit words) were somewhat biased over congruence classes mod 3. To illustrate the approach, consider left rotation by a single bit: : X \\\\lll 1=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} 2X, & \\\\mbox{if } X < 2^{31} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2X + 1 - 2^{32}, & \\\\mbox{if } X \\\\geq 2^{31}\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. Then, because : 2^{32} \\\\equiv 1\\\\pmod 3,\\\\, it follows that : X \\\\lll 1 \\\\equiv 2X\\\\pmod 3. Thus left rotation by a single bit has a simple description modulo 3. Analysis of other operations (data dependent rotation and modular addition) reveals similar, notable biases. Although there are some theoretical problems analysing the operations in combination, the bias can be detected experimentally for the entire cipher. In (Kelsey et al., 1999), experiments were conducted up to seven rounds, and based on this they conjecture that as many as 19 or 20 rounds of RC5P can be distinguished from random using this attack. There is also a corresponding method for recovering the secret key. Against M6 there are attacks mod 5 and mod 257 that are even more effective.

It was released internationally in 2004. The movie was directed and written by Byambasuren Davaa and Luigi Falorni. The plot is about a family of nomadic shepherds in the Gobi Desert trying to save the life of a rare white bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) after it was rejected by its mother. Plot During Spring, a family of nomadic shepherds assists the births of their camel herd. The last camel to calve this season has a protracted labor that persists for two days. With the assistance and intervention of the family, a rare white calf is born. This is the mother camel's first calving. Despite the efforts of the shepherds, the mother rejects the newborn, refusing it her milk and failing to establish a care-bond with it. To restore harmony between the mother and calf, the nomadic family call upon the services of a group of lamas who perform a ritual with bread or dough 'effigies' () of the mother, the calf and the individual members of the family. The rite opens with the sound of a sacred conchshell horn followed by bells in the hands of lamas, some of whom wield vajra. The rite takes place with members of the extended nomadic community and a number of lama at a sacred place that consists of one end of a log, or wooden pole, set in the earth, with the other end raised to the sky: a stylized 'victory banner' () with a piece of blue fabric entwined around it, functioning as a prayer flag (darchor-style). The log is supported by a cairn of rocks at its base as foundation. The ritual, however, does not re-establish harmony between the mother and calf. The family then resolve to secure the services of an indigenous 'violinist' to play the music for a Mongolian 'Hoos' ritual. They send their two young boys on a journey through the desert to the community marketplace to locate a musician. The 'violinist' ‚Äîwho plays more precisely a morin khuur ‚Äî is summoned to the camp and a ritual of folk music and chanting is enacted. The musician first drapes the morin khuur on the first hump of the camel to establish a sympathetic magical linkage between the mother and the state of harmony represented by the instrument. Once this is done he removes the instrument and commences playing. As the musician sounds the Mongolian 'violin', the female family member who lulled her child to sleep with a lullaby earlier in the documentary, repeatedly intones the calming sounds and beautiful melody of the 'hoos'. At this point, the mother camel starts to weep, tears visibly streaming from her eyes. Immediately after the rite the mother and calf are reconciled and the calf draws milk from her teat. Reception The Story of the Weeping Camel received generally positive reviews; on Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 94% 'fresh' rating, with the consensus \\"Delightful and strangely moving\\"; on Metacritic, which uses an average of all critics' reviews, the film has an 81/100, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".

The House of Broglie (, also ; , or ) is a French noble family, originally Piedmontese, who migrated to France in the year 1643. History () was the name of an old Piedmontese family, from which were descended the counts of Casalborgone, Mombello and Revello, and the lords of Arignano, Cortandone, Fontanetto Po, Chieri, Cocconato, Monale, Montaldo,There are several places called Montaldo in Piedmont. None of the sources seems to say which one was associated with the Broglia family. The best that can be said is, that many of the Broglia holdings were near Turin, and that Montaldo Torinese both borders the Broglia holding of Chieri and seems to be the only Montaldo to contain a mediaeval castle Pont Canavese and Santena. The first reference to the name is dated 1245, mentioning one Ardizzone Broglia, father of Guglielmo, decurione of Chieri.C. Tenivelli, Biografia piemontese, III, Torino 1787. Luigi Cibrario, \\"Delle storie di Chieri\\", Librairie Dell'Accad delle Sc., 1827. The founder of the French de Broglie line was Francesco Maria, count of Revello, of the Broglia di Chieri family. Born in 1611 in Piedmont, he took service in the French army in the Thirty Years' War and was naturalized in France after 1643. He is now known as Fran√ßois-Marie, comte de Broglie. After distinguishing himself as a soldier, he died, a lieutenant-general, at the siege of Valenza on 2 July 1656. His son, Victor-Maurice, comte de Broglie (1647‚Äì1727), served under Cond√©, Turenne and other great commanders of the age of Louis XIV. He became mar√©chal de camp in 1676, lieutenant-general in 1688, and finally marshal of France in 1724. His grandson, Fran√ßois-Marie, was made duc de Broglie and a peer of France in 1742. His great-grandson, Victor- Fran√ßois, 2nd duc de Broglie, was created prince of the Holy Roman Empire in 1759 by Emperor Francis I. All junior members of the House of Broglie bear the title of prince de Broglie, while the head of the family is the duc de Broglie. A junior line used the title of prince de Broglie-Revel, after one of its lordships.

He established a Slavic kingdom on the Elbe (in the area of present-day northeastern Germany) in the mid-11th century. His object in life seems to have been to collect the scattered tribes of the Slavs into one kingdom, and to make that kingdom Christian.Cambridge, 806. \\"A pious and god-fearing man\\",Adam of Bremen Gottschalk effected the Christianisation of the Slavic tribes of the Elbe. He organised missions of German priests and founded monasteries at Oldenburg, Mecklenburg,North, Michael. The Baltic, Harvard University Press, 2015, Ratzeburg, L√ºbeck, and Lenzen, erecting the first three into dioceses. He himself often accompanied the missionaries on their work and augmented their message with his own explanations and instructions. In all this, he was supported by the efforts of Adalbert, Archbishop of Hamburg. However, the Obotrite nobility and peasantry largely remained pagan. Life Gottschalk's father Udo was a poor Christian (male christianus according to Adam of BremenMon. Germ. SS., VII, 329) whose own father, Mistiwoi, had renounced the new religion for the old Slavic paganism. Udo sent his son to be educated at the monastery of St Michael at Lenzen and later at L√ºneburg. After a Saxon murdered Udo in 1028, Gottschalk renounced Christianity and took over the leadership of the Liutizi to avenge his father. He killed many Saxons before Duke Bernard II of Saxony defeated and captured him; his lands went to Ratibor of the Polabians. Re-converted to Christianity, Gottschalk was released and sent to Denmark with many of his people to serve King Canute the Great in his wars with Norway. He was sent to England with Canute's son Sweyn. Sven Estridson, Jarl of Denmark, desired independence from King Magnus I of Norway in 1042. Because Magnus was supported by his brother-in-law, Bernard II, Sven achieved an alliance with the Obotrites through the mediation of Gottschalk. However, the Obotrite chief Ratibor was killed in a siege by Magnus in 1043. The death of Ratibor and his sons allowed Gottschalk, who married Sven's daughter Sigrid, to seek the inheritance of his father Udo as Prince of the Obodrites. During the so-called Liutizi Civil War (Lutizischer Bruderkrieg) of 1057, Gottschalk conquered the Circipani and Kessini. He secured the territory through the building of new fortresses; the old fortifications of the conquered tribes were removed. He subdued the Liutizi and the diocese of Bremen \\"feared him as king\\" and paid him tribute. He nurtured alliance with his Christian neighbours, Scandinavian and German and joined in an alliance with Duke Bernard and King Magnus to defeat the Liutizi in battle. Allied with the Lutici, the Obotrites murdered Gottschalk in a 1066 rebellion, capturing the castle of Lenzen and forcing his sons Henry and Budivoj to flee to Denmark and to L√ºneburg respectively. Initially the Lutici-Obotrie alliance was led by Blus, but after his death in 1066, Kruto, whose power-base was Wagria, replaced him. Budivoj campaigned against Kruto with Saxon assistance, but was killed at Pl√∂n in 1075. Henry succeeded in avenging his father's death by killing Kruto at a feast in 1090. Gottschalk's feast is the day of his death, according to the Carthusians of Brussels in the Martyrology of Usuardus. The primary sources for his life are Adam of Bremen and Helmold. \\"Had he lived, he would have brought all pagans to the Christian faith.\\" His son Henry later championed the missionary work of Vicelinus.

He also served in the Ohio House of Representatives and Senate from 1943 to 1951. Early life and education Metzenbaum was born June 4, 1917 in Cleveland, Ohio, to a poor family, the son of Anna (n√©e Klafter) and Charles I. Metzenbaum. His paternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Poland and France, and his maternal grandparents were Hungarian Jews. He attended Glenville High School, where he ran track, while also working odd jobs after hours. He graduated from Ohio State University, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1939 and a law degree in 1941. During the 1940s, he practiced law in Cleveland. After initially facing discrimination due to his Jewish heritage, he found acceptance representing large labor unions, first with the Communications Workers of America and later the International Association of Machinists. Business career Metzenbaum became independently wealthy through investments, particularly in real estate near what became the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, which Metzenbaum and his partner, Alva \\"Ted\\" Bonda, correctly envisioned would make for extremely profitable, 24-hour, well-lit parking lots. The business expanded to become Airport Parking Company of America (APCOA), the world's largest parking lot company. By 1970, he had sold his interest in APCOA Parking for US$20 million. In the early 1970s, Metzenbaum also co-owned the Sun Newspapers chain of weeklies which covered the Cleveland suburbs, a venture undertaken after his first senatorial election defeat.\\"Sun Newspapers,\\" Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, David D. VanTassel, ed., 1997. Retrieved 13 Mar. 2008 Political career Ohio legislature Metzenbaum served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1943 to 1947. He then served in the Ohio Senate from 1947 to 1951. In 1958, he served as the campaign manager for future U.S. Senator Stephen M. Young, who, in a major upset, narrowly unseated incumbent Senator John Bricker, the Republican Party's 1944 Vice Presidential nominee. He returned to assist Young in his successful reelection campaign in 1964. U.S. Senate John Glenn, former rival and later ally to Metzenbaum In 1970, Metzenbaum ran for the Senate seat vacated by Young, who chose not to run for a third term. He narrowly beat astronaut John Glenn in the Democratic primary by a 51% to 49% margin, but narrowly lost to Robert Taft, Jr. in the general election. In 1974, when Senator William B. Saxbe (R-OH) resigned from his seat to accept the nomination as U.S. attorney general, Governor Jack Gilligan appointed Metzenbaum to serve the remainder of Saxbe's term. Metzenbaum ran for election to the seat, but in a bitter Democratic primary, lost to Glenn, who subsequently won the general election by a landslide. In the primary, Metzenbaum contrasted his strong business background with Glenn's military and astronaut credentials, saying his opponent had \\"never worked for a living.\\" Glenn's reply came to be known as the \\"Gold Star Mothers\\" speech. He told Metzenbaum to go to a veterans' hospital and \\"look those men with mangled bodies in the eyes and tell them they didn't hold a job. You go with me to any Gold Star mother and you look her in the eye and tell her that her son did not hold a job\\". Many felt the \\"Gold Star Mothers\\" speech won the primary for Glenn, which he won by 54% to 46%. In 1976, Metzenbaum sought a rematch against Taft. The race was close again, but this time he won, riding on Jimmy Carter's coattails. Taft resigned the seat a few days before his term ended, allowing Metzenbaum to be sworn in a few days early and hence have a small edge in seniority over other senators newly elected in 1976. He was reelected in 1982, comfortably defeating Republican state Senator Paul Pfeifer. That same year, Metzenbaum's cousin, Harriet Woods, ran against Metzenbaum's Republican colleague, John Danforth, for Danforth's U.S. Senate seat in Missouri. Danforth defeated Woods by a margin of less than two percent. In 1981 Metzenbaum was insulted on the floor of the Senate when Senator Ernest Hollings of South Carolina called him the \\"senator from B'nai B'rith\\". Some interpreted this as a slur on Metzenbaum's Jewish faith. Hollings later apologized to Metzenbaum and the remarks were stricken from the record. On December 2, 1981, Metzenbaum was one of four senators to vote against an amendment to President Reagan's MX missiles proposal that would divert the silo system by $334 million as well as earmark further research for other methods that would allow giant missiles to be based. The vote was seen as a rebuff of the Reagan administration. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Glenn and Metzenbaum had strained relations. There was a thaw in 1983 when Metzenbaum endorsed Glenn for president. In 1988 Metzenbaum was opposed by Cleveland mayor George Voinovich. Voinovich accused Metzenbaum of being soft on child pornography. Voinovich's charges were criticized by many, including Glenn, who recorded a statement for television refuting Voinovich's charges. Metzenbaum won the election by 57% to 43%, even as George H. W. Bush won Ohio's electoral votes by 11 percent. Ten years later, Voinovich was elected to Glenn's U.S. Senate seat after Glenn's retirement. Issues Metzenbaum did not run for reelection in 1994. His son-in-law Joel Hyatt was nominated by the Democrats to replace him, but Hyatt lost to Lieutenant Governor Mike DeWine, who had been elected as Voinovich's running mate in 1990. While in the Senate, Metzenbaum was a powerful liberal. He was known as \\"Senator No\\" (a nickname shared by Republican Jesse Helms of North Carolina) and \\"Headline Howard\\" and a \\"headline hog\\" due to his ability to filibuster bills by offering scores of amendments as well as blocking hidden special-interest legislation. Metzenbaum took a particular interest in antitrust and consumer protection issues, often threatening to repeal the antitrust law exemption given to Major League Baseball. Since his retirement, the issue has gone largely unaddressed. Metzenbaum became well known for his service on the Senate Judiciary Committee, particularly because of his efforts to keep stringent antitrust laws and his pro-choice stance on abortion. Metzenbaum was skeptical of corporations and agencies promoting aspartame. An allegation was that the G. D. Searle & Company was trying to bring aspartame to market and get it approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by submitting false data. Metzenbaum berated Searle's fabricated tests and also faulted the American Medical Association (AMA), whose Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) reported, with some significant disclaimers, that aspartame was safe for most people. Of the report, Metzenbaum said, \\"I wish that this [JAMA] report could ease my concerns. It does not. It merely restates the FDA position, which relies solely on the Searle tests. As I have indicated these tests are under a cloud. In addition, the concerns raised recently by the scientists...were not even included in the report.\\" In 1985, the U.S. Senate heard testimony relating to an amendment by Metzenbaum that would require the quantity of aspartame in a product to be labeled. Cleveland Stokers In January 1968 Metzenbaum and Bonda purchased the Cleveland Stokers soccer club from Cleveland Indians executives Vernon Stouffer and Gabe Paul. Under their leadership, the team played one year in the North American Soccer League, and even won their division, before departing the league due to differences in business philosophy with the other owners. Retirement After leaving the Senate in 1995, Metzenbaum served as the chairman of the Consumer Federation of America. He died at his home in Aventura, Florida on March 12, 2008.Howard M. Metzenbaum, Who Battled Big Business as Ohio Senator, Dies at 90 He was buried at Mayfield Cemetery in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. Denying urban legends to the contrary, Metzenbaum said he was never affiliated with the Communist Party.Personal correspondence, Jan. 5, 2006, from Harold S. Stern, Metzenbaum's law partner after 1953 When the National Republican Senatorial Committee suggested in 1987 that he had \\"Communist sympathies\\", Chairman Rudy Boschwitz apologized for the insulting smear. Metzenbaum's cousin James Metzenbaum was an Ohio attorney who wrote a text on zoning law and once ran for a seat on the Ohio Supreme Court. Legacy The Old Federal Building and Post Office, now Howard M. Metzenbaum United States Courthouse Metzenbaum was behind several pieces of enacted legislation during his senatorial career.

For more than a decade, until June 30, 2012, Fitzgerald was the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. Prior to his appointment, he served as Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York from 1988 to 2001, and as Chief of the Organized Crime-Terrorism Unit since December 1995, where he participated in the prosecutions of Osama Bin Laden, Abdel Rahman, and Ramzi Yousef. As special counsel for the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel, Fitzgerald was the federal prosecutor in charge of the investigation of the Valerie Plame Affair, which led to the prosecution and conviction in 2007 of Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff Scooter Libby for perjury. As a federal prosecutor, he led a number of high-profile investigations, including those which led to convictions of Illinois Governors Rod Blagojevich and George Ryan, media mogul Conrad Black, several aides to Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley in the Hired Truck Program, and Chicago police detective and torturer Jon Burge. Personal Fitzgerald was born into a Roman Catholic family of Irish descent in Brooklyn.

There, he served on a team of prosecutors investigating Osama bin Laden. He also served as chief counsel in prosecutions related to the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. Illinois On September 1, 2001, Fitzgerald was nominated for the position of U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois on the recommendation of U.S. Senator Peter Fitzgerald (no relation), a Republican from Illinois. On October 24, 2001, the nomination was confirmed by the Senate. The Senator urged the selection because Patrick Fitzgerald is not from Chicago; Patrick said that he had visited Chicago only one day, for a wedding in 1982, before his selection.U.S. \\"Attorneys Patrick Fitzgerald of Chicago and James Comey of Manhattan are both tough-minded career prosecutors. They're also best friends\\", American Lawyer, December 11, 2008 Soon after becoming U.S. Attorney for Northern Illinois, Fitzgerald began an investigation of political appointees of Republican Illinois Governor George Ryan, who were suspected of accepting bribes to give licenses to unqualified truck drivers. Fitzgerald soon expanded this investigation, uncovering a network of political bribery and gift-giving, and leading to more than 60 indictments. Ryan was indicted in December 2003. At the conclusion of the trial in April 2006, Ryan was found guilty on all eighteen counts against him. Ryan's co-defendant, Chicago businessman Larry Warner, then 67 years old, was convicted of racketeering conspiracy, fraud, attempted extortion, and money laundering. The two were sentenced on September 6, 2006: Ryan received a sentence of six and one half years, and Warner received a sentence of three years and five months.Former Illinois Gov. George Ryan Heading to Prison; NPR; November 6, 2007 Against criticism that these cases were based on circumstantial evidence, Fitzgerald responded: \\"People now know that if you're part of a corrupt conduct, where one hand is taking care of the other and contracts are going to people, you don't have to say the word 'bribe' out loud. And I think people need to understand we won't be afraid to take strong circumstantial cases into court.\\" Fitzgerald's early official portrait On July 18, 2005, his office indicted a number of top aides to Democrat Richard M. Daley, the mayor of Chicago, on charges of mail fraud, alleging numerous instances of corruption in hiring practices at City Hall. In March 2006, former Chicago City Clerk James Laski pleaded guilty to pocketing nearly $50,000 in bribes for steering city business to two trucking companies. Laski was the highest-ranking Chicago official and Daley administration employee brought down by Fitzgerald's office in conjunction with the Hired Truck Program scandal. Beginning in April 2007, Fitzgerald oversaw Operation Crooked Code, the investigation and prosecution of over two dozen defendants for bribery and related charges in City of Chicago's Departments of Buildings and Zoning. On December 9, 2008, federal agents arrested Governor Blagojevich for conspiring to profit from his authority to appoint President Barack Obama's successor to the U.S. Senate. Fitzgerald said Blagojevich \\"put a 'for sale' sign on the naming of a United States Senator.\\" United States Senator Peter Fitzgerald chose not to run for reelection in 2004, leaving Patrick Fitzgerald without a congressional patron. In the summer of 2005, there were rumors that he would not be reappointed to a second four-year term in retaliation for his investigations into corruption in Illinois and Chicago government, as well as for his investigation of the Plame scandal. On May 23, 2012, Fitzgerald held a press conference informing the public that he was stepping down from his position and retiring as the US Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois Federal Court effective June 30, 2012. Long-time prosecutor Gary S. Shapiro was named US Attorney until a replacement had been selected. In 2013, Fitzgerald was appointed by Governor Patrick Quinn (D-IL) to the Board of Trustees for the University of Illinois. Private practice Fitzgerald is now a partner with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in the firm's Chicago office. Notable cases Fitzgerald announces drug trafficking charges at the Department of Justice in 2009. Plame investigation On December 30, 2003, after then-Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself from the CIA leak grand jury investigation of the Plame affair due to conflicts of interest, Deputy Attorney General James B. Comey, acting as Attorney General in Ashcroft's place, appointed Fitzgerald to the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel in charge of the investigation. Fitzgerald was well-known to Comey and was in fact already godfather to one of Comey's children. On December 30, 2003, three months after the start of the Plame investigation, Fitzgerald was appointed Special Counsel. Through this, Fitzgerald was delegated \\"all the authority of the Attorney General\\" in the matter. In February 2004, Acting Attorney General Comey clarified the delegated authority and stated that Fitzgerald has plenary authority. Comey also wrote \\"further, my conferral on you of the title of 'Special Counsel' in this matter should not be misunderstood to suggest that your position and authorities are defined and limited by 28 CFR Part 600.\\" On October 28, 2005, Fitzgerald brought an indictment for 5 counts of false statements, perjury, and obstruction of justice against Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby, U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney's Chief of Staff. Libby resigned to prepare for his legal defense. In his first press conference after announcing Libby's indictment, Fitzgerald was asked about comments by Republicans such as Kay Bailey Hutchison, who said \\"I certainly hope that if there is going to be an indictment that says something happened, that it is an indictment on a crime and not some perjury technicality ...\\" to which Fitzgerald responded, \\"That talking point won't fly ... The truth is the engine of our judicial system. If you compromise the truth, the whole process is lost ... if we were to walk away from this, we might as well hand in our jobs.\\" Robert Novak's testimony in Libby's perjury trial made it known that the two senior administration sources he cited in his article were Richard Armitage and Karl Rove. A month later Armitage claimed Fitzgerald had instructed him not to go public with this information. Journalist Michael Isikoff received confirmation from Rove's lawyer and from lobbyist Richard F. Hohlt that Rove was also faxed an advance copy of the article revealing a CIA covert agent's identity several days before it was published.A Man of Mystery; MSNBC - Newsweek reproduction; Michael Isikoff; February 26, 2007 On March 6, 2007, Libby was convicted of 4 out of 5 charges of lying under oath. Fitzgerald announced on the courthouse steps that while he is always open to receiving new information related to the case, he expects to file no further charges, and the prosecutors would \\"return to their day jobs\\". Libby was sentenced to a $250,000 fine, 2 years of probation and a 2¬Ω year prison term. After a court of appeals rejected Libby's attempt to delay the prison sentence while he appealed the verdict, President George W. Bush commuted the prison portion of Libby's sentence but did not commute the fine. Two days after the verdict, Congressman Henry Waxman, chair of the U.S. House Committee on Government Reform, announced that his committee would ask Plame to testify on March 16, in an effort by his committee to look into \\"whether White House officials followed appropriate procedures for safeguarding Plame's identity.\\"Plame to testify to Congress on leak; Reuters; Jim Young; March 9, 2007 In March 2007, Fitzgerald \\"was ranked among prosecutors who had 'not distinguished themselves' as opposed to \\"'strong U.S. Attorneys ... who exhibited loyalty' to the administration\\" on a Justice Department chart sent to the White House in March 2005 ...\\" This was revealed in light of an investigation of the December 2006 firings of several U.S. Attorneys by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, perceived as being politically motivated and despite his previous Attorney General's Award for Distinguished Service in 2002. Two other prosecutors so ranked were dismissed. On July 2, 2007, President Bush provided a statement on his decision to commute Mr. Libby's prison sentence and noted: > After the investigation was under way, the Justice Department appointed > United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois Patrick > Fitzgerald as a Special Counsel in charge of the case. Mr. Fitzgerald is a > highly qualified, professional prosecutor who carried out his > responsibilities as charged. Libby was eventually pardoned by President Donald Trump on April 13, 2018. Conrad Black and Hollinger On November 17, 2005, Fitzgerald brought criminal fraud charges against former Canadian media mogul, Conrad Black, as well as against three other Hollinger executives. The trial of Lord Black began at the Federal Court in Chicago in March 2007. Black was convicted on July 13, 2007 and later sentenced to serve 78 months in federal prison, pay Hollinger $6.1 million and a fine of $125,000.BBC News Business: \\"Conrad Black convicted of fraud\\" July 13, 2007. RISCISO Indictments On February 1, 2006, the U.S. Attorney's Office under Fitzgerald announced that it was indicting nineteen members of Risciso, a software and movie piracy ring, in U.S. District Court in Chicago. The lead prosecutor for the Government in this case was Assistant U.S. Attorney Pravin Rao. This prosecution was the result of an undercover investigation, Operation Jolly Roger, that was part of Operation Site Down‚Äîa law enforcement initiative by the FBI and law enforcement agents from ten other countries to disrupt and dismantle many of the leading warez groups that distribute and trade in copyrighted software, movies, music, and games on the Internet. Blagojevich corruption arrest On December 9, 2008, Fitzgerald confirmed in a press conference in Chicago that Illinois state governor Rod Blagojevich and his chief of staff, John Harris, had been arrested by the FBI early that morning on charges of corruption. Fitzgerald described Blagojevich's actions as the \\"kind of conduct [that] would make Lincoln roll over in his grave.\\" Blagojevich was charged with mail fraud and solicitation of a bribe. According to Fitzgerald, Blagojevich attempted to sell off President-elect Barack Obama's open U.S. Senate seat to the highest bidder, as well as pressuring the Chicago Tribune to fire editors critical of the Blagojevich administration in exchange for state assistance in selling Wrigley Field. Fitzgerald said at the news conference that, \\"I laid awake at night\\", worrying about the possible firing of Tribune editors. Larry Nassar investigation In 2014, Fitzgerald was hired by Michigan State University to conduct an internal MSU investigation to discover whether and when university officials knew about sexual assault allegations against Dr. Larry Nassar. Fitzgerald reported directly to university officials that no MSU official \\"believed\\" that Nassar had committed sexual assault, but did not provide any written report detailing the evidence for this claim.Justin Hinkley, MSU lawyer tells Bill Schuette officials didn't know about Nassar until 2016, Detroit Free Press, December 8, 2017; Michael Campbell, Dr. Larry Nassar: A history of preying on people, Lansing State Journal and IndyStar timeline, http://interactives.indystar.com/news/standing/OutofBalance/NassarTimeline/LSJ.html See also *Rod Blagojevich federal corruption scandal *CIA leak grand jury investigation *Operation Crooked CodeFitzgerald Named \\"Fed of The Year\\" by ticklethewire.com *Plame affair timeline *U.S. Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel References External links *USDOJ Office of Special Counsel Homepage *Interview with Fitzgerald on the Patriot Act at the Pritzker Military Museum & Library *M.J.

Byrd Jr. of Virginia). Early life and career Saxbe's law offices, in Mechanicsburg, Ohio Saxbe was born 1916 in Mechanicsburg, Ohio, the son of Faye Henry \\"Maggie\\" (n√©e Carey) Saxbe, and Bart Rockwell Saxbe.William B. Saxbe, Peter D. Franklin, Diana Britt Franklin I've seen the elephant page 7 (Accessed February 14, 2010) He received a bachelor's degree, from The Ohio State University, Class of 1940, where he was a member of the Chi Phi Fraternity. He served in the U.S. Army Air Forces, during World War II, from 1940 to 1945, and Korean War, from 1951 to 1952. When he returned from World War II, he entered Ohio State University law school. However, while still in law school, he campaigned for the Ohio House of Representatives during 1947, and won. During 1948, when Saxbe was near the end of second term, he received a law degree. He remained in the Ohio National Guard and was on active duty during the Korean War, from 1951 to 1952. He was discharged from the reserve with the rank of colonel during 1963. He served as the Ohio House majority leader during 1951 and 1952, and as speaker of the House during 1953 and 1954. Higher political office During 1957, Saxbe was elected Ohio Attorney General, defeating Democrat Stephen M. Young. He was re- elected three times and had that office until 1968. In this capacity, Saxbe argued the murder case of Doctor Sam Sheppard before the United States Supreme Court during 1966, against Sheppard's attorney F. Lee Bailey. He was a member of the Ohio Crime Commission from 1967 to 1968. During 1968, Saxbe was elected to the U.S. Senate, defeating the Democratic candidate, former Ohio Rep. (1965‚Äì67) John J. Gilligan. During his campaign, he became a prominent supporter of a national health insurance system. When President Nixon resumed bombing North Vietnam in late 1972, Saxbe stated that the President had 'lost his senses'.https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/us/25saxbe.html He served in the Senate until January 4, 1974, when Nixon appointed him U.S. Attorney General. Saxbe was the permanent replacement for Elliot Richardson, who had been dismissed by Nixon during the Watergate scandal's so-called \\"Saturday Night Massacre\\". Saxbe took over from Solicitor General Robert Bork, who had served as acting Attorney General after the \\"Massacre\\". There was some minor controversy regarding Saxbe's appointment and the Ineligibility Clause of the Constitution. That provision states that a legislator cannot be appointed to an executive position during the same term that the legislature had voted to increase the salary of said position. Nixon addressed the problem by having Congress reduce the salary of the Attorney General to $35,000,Deseret News, 8 December 1973, p. A1 as it was before Saxbe's term in the Senate began. This maneuver had only occurred once before, when Senator Philander C. Knox had been appointed Secretary of State during 1909, and has since become known as the \\"Saxbe fix\\". Because there was not any perception that anything intentional had been done to benefit Saxbe, the matter was largely ignored. As Attorney General for Nixon, Saxbe supervised the antitrust suit that ended the Bell System telephone monopoly. Gilligan, who had been elected Governor of Ohio during 1970, appointed Howard Metzenbaum to serve Saxbe's vacated term. Later that year, former astronaut John Glenn, another Democrat, was elected to replace Saxbe. Saxbe served as U.S. Attorney General for the first few months of the President Ford Administration, before resigning in early 1975, when he was appointed United States Ambassador to India. He served in that capacity until 1977. After that, Saxbe returned to Mechanicsburg and resumed the practice of law. Personal life During 1940, Saxbe married the former Ardath Louise \\"Dolly\\" Kleinhans.West's Encyclopedia of American Law (accessed February 14, 2010) They had three children: William Bart Saxbe Jr., Juliet Louise \\"Juli\\" Saxbe Spitzer, and Charles Rockwell \\"Rocky\\" Saxbe. Charles Saxbe served four terms in Ohio House of Representatives, and later as an attorney in private practice. Saxbe was known for his quips. Asked about Sen. Robert Dole, he commented that Dole was so unpopular with his fellow senators that he \\"couldn't sell beer on a troop ship\\". He died in his hometown of Mechanicsburg, Ohio at the age of 94 on August 24, 2010.

Subsequently, the Ardeatine Caves site (Fosse Ardeatine)Fosse (plural of fossa ‚Äì \\"ditch\\"), is the Italian word used for \\"mass gravesite\\". was declared a Memorial Cemetery and National Monument open daily to visitors. Every year, on the anniversary of the slaughter and in the presence of the senior officials of the Italian Republic, a solemn state commemoration is held at the monument in honour of the fallen. Each year, 335 names are called out, a simple roll call of the dead, to reinforce that 335 discrete individuals symbolise a collective entity. Historical background In July 1943, the Allies landed on the island of Sicily, preparing to invade the mainland, and Rome was bombed for the first time. On 24 July, the Fascist Grand Council, which the dictator Benito Mussolini had not convened since 1939, met and overwhelmingly voted no confidence in Mussolini. The following day, anxious to extricate his country from an unsustainable war, King Victor Emanuel III, the titular head of the Italian government and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces under Mussolini, appointed Marshal Pietro Badoglio to head a new military government. He then ordered his gendarmerie, the Carabinieri, to arrest and imprison Mussolini. In August 1943, Rome was bombed again, and the Badoglio government began secret surrender negotiations with the Allies in Sicily, although still outwardly allied to Germany. In accordance with the Pope's wishes, the Italian government also unilaterally declared Rome an open city, i.e., a demilitarized zone, a declaration the Allies would refuse to recognise and the Germans to respect. The Germans, anticipating an Italian defection, meanwhile began moving more and more troops into Italy (Operation Achse). Foreseeing a German invasion, a coalition of Anti-Fascist parties and Monarchists formed the Committee of National Liberation (CLN). On 3 September the Badoglio government signed an unconditional surrender, which U.S. General Eisenhower made public on the eve of the Fifth Army's amphibious landing at Salerno (8 September). At the same time, Badoglio issued the Badoglio Proclamation, directing Italian troops to end hostilities against the Allies but to oppose attacks \\"from any other quarter\\". The following day, the German army began moving in on Rome, and that night the King and Badoglio fled the city for Pescara and then to Bari, leaving a leadership vacuum. The Royal Italian Army, although outnumbering the German soldiers three to one, was leaderless, poorly equipped, and in chaos. After a failed resistance at the Pyramid of Cestius by remaining loyalist soldiers, carabinieri (including a school of cadets), and civilians, the Germans occupied Rome. They announced the imposition of German military law with summary execution for violators. Three days later (on 12 September), Nazi commandos tracked down and rescued Mussolini from his hidden prison in the Gran Sasso and set him up in the puppet regime of the so-called \\"Republic of Sal√≤\\" in Northern Italy. In October they rounded up and deported the Jews of Rome for extermination at Auschwitz and also made numerous mass roundups of non-Jewish male civilians for forced labor. Meanwhile, General Mark Clark's Fifth Army in Salerno suffered severe setbacks, and General Eisenhower and other Allied leaders began concentrating their attention on the imminent invasion of France, temporarily neglecting Italy. In December, the armed Partisan Resistance began to strike German forces in Rome. The Germans responded with raids carried out by mixed Gestapo and Italian Fascist police militias on Vatican institutions known to be harbouring prominent CNL members and other Anti-Fascists.. In January news of the surprise Allied landing behind enemy lines at Anzio (Operation Shingle), only 30 miles from Rome, created temporary euphoria among the Roman populace along with a dangerous relaxation of caution on the part of Resistance members that enabled the Nazis to arrest and torture many of its most important leaders. In the meantime, General Clark's attempt to link up the Fifth Army with the Anzio troops was unsuccessful, as the Anzio forces were held back by a line of German fortifications hastily constructed using forced civilian labour. Partisan attack in Via Rasella A body lies in the Via Rasella during the roundup of civilians by Italian soldiers and German troops after the partisan bombing on 23 March 1944. On 23 March 1944, a column of the German 11th Company, 3rd Battalion, SS Police Regiment Bozen, was attacked by an ambush of Partisans while marching and singing on a prescribed route that led through the Piazza di Spagna into the narrow street of Via Rasella. Organised by the Nazis to intimidate and suppress the Resistance, the battalion had been raised in October 1943 from ethnic German-speakers of the northern Italian province of South Tyrol, a territory that Hitler had annexed to the German Reich after the September \\"betrayal\\" by the Italian government. Many of its citizens had since opted for German citizenship.For a discussion of the role played by South Tyrol in the aftermath of the war, see Gerald Steinacher's Nazis on the Run (Oxford University Press, 2012) and Robert Knight, \\"Not Quite Divine Providence\\", Times Literary Supplement, 6 January 2012, p. 10. The soldiers of the battalion were veterans of the Royal Italian Army who had seen action on the Russian Front and had chosen service in the SS rather than face another tour in the East with the Wehrmacht.. The attack was carried out by 16 partisans of the Communist-dominated resistance organisation Gruppo d'Azione Patriottica (\\"Patriotic Action Group\\") or GAP. An improvised explosive device was prepared consisting of 12 kilogrammes of TNT packed in a steel case. This was inserted into a bag containing an additional six kilograms of TNT and TNT filled iron tubing. Although reported as having been thrown from a building, the bomb had actually been hidden in a rubbish cart, pushed into position by a Partisan disguised as a street cleaner, while others acted as lookouts. The fuse was lit when the police were forty seconds from the bomb. The blast caused the immediate deaths of 28 SS policemen and may have killed two civilian bystanders, one of whom, Piero Zuccheretti, was an eleven-year-old boy, although he might have been killed by the Germans firing in response; it is unknown. More would die over the next few days. All sixteen Partisans‚Äîsome of whom fired on the German column‚Äîsucceeded in melting away into the crowd unscathed.. Preparations for the reprisal German troops and Italian soldiers of the Decima Flottiglia MAS round-up of civilians in front of the Palazzo Barberini, Rome, in March 1944. The German police attach√© and commander of the Security Police in Rome, SS Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Herbert Kappler was on the scene soon afterwards to supervise the investigation. That evening he was summoned to the headquarters of the German Armed Forces Commandant in Rome, Luftwaffe Generalmajor Kurt M√§lzer, who had decided that the killings called for reprisals. They agreed that the execution of ten Italians for each German policeman killed was a suitable ratio. M√§lzer, who also proposed burning down part of Rome, passed this on to General Eberhard von Mackensen, the commander of the Fourteenth Army, whose jurisdiction included Rome. General Mackensen endorsed the recommendation. In turn, the staff of the German Commander-in-Chief South (Oberbefehlshaber S√ºd), passed this on to the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW). That night, Adolf Hitler authorised the reprisal, stipulating that it be carried out within 24 hours.. Commander-in-Chief South Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, considered this an order, one he interpreted as calling for the execution of Italians who had been previously sentenced to death. He was assured by Kappler that sufficient prisoners were available.. However, Kappler had only four prisoners sentenced to death in his Hausgef√§ngnis (private prison) at SS headquarters in the German Embassy on 145 Via Tasso (now the Museum of the Liberation of Rome); plus 17 serving long sentences; 167 deemed \\"worthy of death\\"; and two to four civilians who had been rounded up in the Via Rasella area on suspicion of involvement. Kappler's superior, SS Brigadef√ºhrer und Generalmajor der Polizei Wilhelm Harster, suggested making up the numbers from the 57 Jews also in Nazi custody. By noon on 24 March, Kappler had a list of 271 victims, each with his crime listed against his name, except for the Jews, simply listed as \\"Jew\\". By this time the death toll from the Via Rasella bombing had risen to 32. (One more would die while the reprisal was under way; the death toll eventually reaching 33.) To make up the numbers, Questore Pietro Caruso, chief of the Fascist police in Rome, offered some Italians from his Regina Coeli prison, one of whom, Maurizio Giglio, had been one of his own Lieutenants, before being unmasked as a double agent working for the American OSS in charge of radio communications with the Fifth Army.Code named \\"Cervo\\", Giglio, from a prominent Roman family, had been subjected to horrific torture, see Katz (2003), pp. xvi and passim. Because of the time limit that Hitler had imposed, M√§lzer and Kappler agreed that the victims would have to be shot in the back of the head at close range rather than by conventional firing squad.. The men of the regiment Bozen, the unit which was hit in the attack, were offered to avenge their comrades but they refused to do it in that way. Massacre The massacre was perpetrated without prior public notice in a little-frequented rural suburb of the city, inside the tunnels of the disused quarries of pozzolana, near the Via Ardeatina. By mistake,Jewish Virtual Library, Priebke file. a total of 335 Italian prisoners were taken, five in excess of the 330 called for. On 24 March, led by SS officers Erich Priebke and Karl Hass, they were transported to the Ardeatine caves in truckloads and then, in groups of five, put to death inside the caves. Because the killing squad mostly consisted of officers who had never killed before, Kappler had ordered several cases of cognac delivered to the caves to calm the officers' nerves. The officers were ordered to lead the doomed prisoners into the caves with their hands tied behind their backs and then have them kneel down so that the soldiers could place a bullet directly into the cerebellum, ensuring that no more than one bullet would be needed per prisoner. Many were forced to kneel down over the bodies of those who had been killed before them because the cave had become filled with dead bodies. During the killings, the existence of the five extra prisoners was discovered, and it was decided to kill them anyway, in order to prevent news of the location of the place of execution from becoming known. A German officer, named Amon, testified at Kappler's trial, which took place in Italy in 1948;Trial against Herbert Kappler and others for the Ardeatine Massacre, 12 June 1948 hearing. claiming that once he entered the cave and saw the piles of dead bodies, he fainted and was replaced by a comrade who pushed him aside and shot another victim. The bodies of the victims were placed in piles, typically about a metre in height, and then buried under tons of rock debris when German military engineers set explosives to seal the caves and hide the atrocity. They remained summarily buried and abandoned for over a year inside the caves. Families of the victims were notified with excruciating slowness by individual letter, if at all, a strategy of cover-up and concealment‚Äî\\"Night and Fog\\"‚Äîdesigned to confuse, grieve, and intimidate surviving relatives, according to Robert Katz.See \\"Night and Fog Decree\\", Document retrieved from the archives of the Avalon Project at the Yale Law School, on website, A Teacher' Guide to the Holocaust, fcit.usf.edu; \\"Nacht und Nebel\\", German for \\"Night and Fog\\" (a direct reference to a \\"Tarnhelm\\" spell, from Wagner's Rheingold) was a directive (German: Erlass) from Hitler on 7 December 1941 that was originally intended to winnow out all political activists and resistance \\"helpers\\", ‚Äúanyone endangering German security‚Äù (\\"die deutsche Sicherheit gef√§hrden\\") throughout Nazi Germany's occupied territories. .. . The decree was meant to intimidate local populations into submission by denying friends and families of the missing any knowledge of their whereabouts or their fate. The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg held that the disappearances committed as part of the Nacht und Nebel program were war crimes which violated both the Hague Conventions and customary international law. Only after Rome was liberated by the Allies on 4 June 1944, were the bodies found, by Armando Della Valle and another fireman who were sent to search in the caves after a tip off, exhumed, and given proper burial. Victims Plaque dedicated to Don Pietro Pappagallo, on the house in which he lived on the Via Urbana, Rome: IN THIS HOUSE IN THE DARK TIME OF THE NAZI OCCUPATION THERE SHONE THE LIGHT OF THE GENEROUS HEART OF DON PIETRO PAPPAGALLO TERLIZZI (BARI) 28¬∑6¬∑1888 ROME ARDEATINE CAVES 24¬∑3¬∑1944 HE RECEIVED WITH LOVE THE PERSECUTED OF EVERY FAITH AND CONDITION UNTO THE SACRIFICE OF HIS OWN SELF HE FELL IN THE ULTIMATE SIGN OF REDEMPTION AND THE FORGIVENESS OF GOD THE CITY OF ROME ON THE 53RD ANNIVERSARY OF THE MASSACRE REMEMBERS THAT THOSE WHO DIED FOR FREEDOM ARE THE LIVING SEEDS OF A BETTER HUMANITY Misconceptions about the Fosse Ardeatine Massacre abound. Foremost among these is the notion that the Partisans responsible for the Via Rasella attack were ordered to come forward and turn themselves in to the SS and wilfully declined to do so.For example, see Alessandro Portelli, in Katharine Hodgkin and Susannah Radstone, editors, Memory, History, Nation: Contested Pasts (Transaction Publishers, 2005), p. 30. Although it is sometimes claimed that the reprisal victims were predominantly Jewish, only 75 of the 335 victims selected for death in the caves were Jewish, this having been a criterion for selection (because Jews were known to be marked for death anyway).For example, Groliers Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 23, (1993), p. 699 erroneously states that the Ardeatine victims were \\"mostly Jews\\". In fact, the victims comprised, in [Robert Katz]'s words, \\"rich, and poor, doctors and lawyers, workers and shopkeepers, artists and artisans, teachers and students, men and teenage boys from every walk of life, and even a man of God to walk among them\\".. The main concern of the SS had been speedy fulfilment of the quota. Some were residents of Via Rasella who were home at the time of the Partisan attack; others had been arrested and tortured for suspected Resistance and other anti-Fascist activities, while still others had been casually picked up on the streets or arrested at their homes on the basis of tips from Fascist informants. The youngest of them was 15 years old.see section \\"Lista dei martiri delle Fosse Ardeatine\\" listing of 323 victims by name Political prisoners included members of the GAP, the PA, and the Monarchist Clandestine Military Front of the Resistance (FMRC), which included many policemen. Members of the Bandiera Rossa (\\"Red Flag\\") a dissident Communist Resistance group, constituted the largest group. One political prisoner, Padre Pietro Pappagallo, was one of the models for the character of Padre Pietro in Roberto Rossellini's pioneering neo-realist film Rome, Open City, filmed in 1944. Another, perhaps the most celebrated, was the aristocratic Colonel Giuseppe Montezemolo (age 44), who, after the flight of the King and Badoglio, had elected to stay and go underground in Rome, disguised in mufti as a professor or Ingegnere (engineer), to organize and lead the FMRC, representing the Badoglio Government, with which he had been in continual radio contact up until his arrest on 25 January 1944.The FMCR operated under the directive of \\"war against the German and the maintenance of public order\\", see . Colonel Giuseppe Montezemolo's incredible courage under torture that included having his nails and teeth pulled out, became legendary. Another was General Simone Simoni (it), a war hero aged 64, who had endured torture with a blowtorch. The old soldier had replied to his captors, \\"My only regret is that I was not younger because there was so much more I could have done [for my country]\\". Neither man ever talked or in any way betrayed their network.See German wikipedia entry on Giuseppe Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo and . In March 2011, on the eve of Pope's visit to the monument commemorating the massacre, Colonel Montezemolo's son, Cardinal Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo (born 1925), told interviewer Giampolo Mattei of the Osservatore Romano: \\"This is a memorial that brings everyone into agreement: Christians and Jews, believers and non-believers. The memorial conveys the sense of brotherhood even in death. There has only been reciprocal respect, and never any room for vengeful thoughts or religious conflict. Memorial events have been organized without any problem, in full solidarity and collaboration. Death really brought diverse people together and made even the living brothers. I remember that during the recovery and identification process, a Catholic priest as well as a rabbi were with us to give the blessings.

The massive bronze gate by Mirko Basaldella used the ubiquitous barbed wire of battle fields and concentration camps as inspiration, merging it with the moving curlicues of a Tree of Life. The curved lines morph into a tangle of limbs reaching out across each other at those awkwardly bent angles characteristic of corpses. Also at the entrance is a colossal concrete statue by Francesco Coccia of three male figures standing together as one. Hands tied behind their backs, the three ages of man are bound together by ideals and fate‚Äîthe youngest Fosse victim was 15, the oldest 70. Each face has a distinct expression portraying the range of emotions the men likely felt marching to their deaths in the quarry: despair, eyes half-closed in resignation, a resolute distant stare. Each face on the statue directs its gaze towards an important element of the memorial complex: the burial slab, the old quarries, and the forecourt. The memorial plaque outside the entry to the caves reads: WAYFARERS THIRSTY FOR LIBERTY ‚Äì WE WERE ROUNDED UP AT RANDOM ‚Äì IN THE STREET AND IN JAIL ‚Äì AS A REPRISAL CAST IN EN MASSE ‚Äì SLAUGHTERED AND WALLED WITHIN THESE PITS ‚Äì ITALIANS, DO NOT CURSE ‚Äì MOTHERS, BRIDES, DO NOT WEEP ‚Äì CHILDREN, CARRY WITH PRIDE ‚Äì THE MEMORY ‚Äì OF THE HOLOCAUST OF YOUR FATHERS ‚Äì IF OUR SLAUGHTER ‚Äì WILL HAVE HAD A PURPOSE BEYOND REVENGE ‚Äì IT IS TO ENSHRINE THE RIGHT OF HUMAN EXISTENCE ‚Äì AGAINST THE CRIME OF MURDER Inside the former quarries themselves, there are two more plaques. One in the tunnel: WE WERE SLAUGHTERED IN THIS PLACE BECAUSE ‚Äì WE FOUGHT AGAINST INTERNAL TYRANNY ‚Äì FOR FREEDOM AND AGAINST THE FOREIGNER ‚Äì FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE HOMELAND ‚Äì WE DREAMT A FREE, JUST ‚Äì AND DEMOCRATIC ITALY. MAY OUR SACRIFICE AND OUR BLOOD ‚Äì SOW THE SEED AND ACT AS WARNING FOR ‚Äì GENERATIONS TO COME. And another in the 'cave' at the very end where the massacre actually took place: HERE WE WERE SLAUGHTERED ‚Äì VICTIMS OF A HORRENDOUS SACRIFICE ‚Äì MAY OUR SACRIFICE GIVE RISE TO A BETTER HOMELAND ‚Äì AND TO LASTING PEACE AMONG THE PEOPLES. FROM THE DEPTHS, I HAVE CRIED OUT TO YOU, O LORD. The last phrase, taken from Penitential Psalm 130, was most likely chosen for its parallel significance in Christianity and Judaism, simultaneously speaking for 260 Christians and 75 Jews killed and buried side by side. The text in the cave is written in both Latin: clamavi ad te, domine, and Hebrew: ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î ◊ß◊®◊ê◊™◊ô◊ö ◊û◊û◊¢◊û◊ß◊ô◊ù ◊î◊û◊¢◊ú◊ï◊™ ◊©◊ô◊® Legacy For a number of reasons, including (but not limited to): the large number of victims; the fact that many of them were innocent civilians casually taken only to make up the number of those to be killed; the cruel methods implemented (even by Nazi standards) to carry out the massacre; the fact that the reprisal order had come directly from Adolf Hitler, and the hiding of the bodies, which were buried summarily instead of being returned to their families, the slaughter became a symbol of the various massacres carried out against civilians in Italy from 8 September 1943 until the German surrender on 8 May 1945. In December 2007, Giorgio Bettio, a city councillor of Treviso, Italy and member of the Northern League party, suggested that \\"With immigrants, we should use the same system the SS used, punish 10 of them for every slight against one of our citizens\\" in reference to Italy's current debate over immigration policies. This comment was met with public condemnation, and Bettio later said, \\"I certainly made a mistake in citing the SS.\\" He claimed the incident had been \\"sensationalized\\" by the media.. The Vatican The Vatican's role in the massacre came under particular scrutiny following the publication of Robert Katz's first book, Death in Rome (1967), in which he speculated that Pope Pius XII had advance knowledge of the Nazi orders and did little to forestall it. This was vigorously disputed by the Pope's defenders. In an update to his book, Katz cited a document released by the Vatican in 1980‚Äîa message dated 25 March to the Papal Secretariat from an engineer called Ferrero warning of imminent bloody reprisals‚Äîin support of his claim. According to Katz, the Vatican has yet to release exonerating documentation, if any exist. Katz elaborated on this in 2003 in The Battle for Rome: The Germans, The Allies, The Partisans, and The Pope, September 1943 ‚Äì June 1944, using evidence from recently released OSS and Vatican sources that certain German diplomats, notably Eugen Dollmann, Himmler's representative in RomeBorn, like Father Pankratius, in Bavaria, S.S. Standartenf√ºrer Eugen Dollmann later worked as a spy for the CIA and was interviewed extensively by Katz. According to , \\"Dollman was undoubtedly a rogue, a wastrel, and a former S.S. officer, but he was neither a brute nor a killer\\". and German Consul Eitel M√∂llhausenGerman Consul Eitel M√∂llhausen was the ranking German diplomat in Rome. He lobbied strenuously and courageously but vainly against the deportation of the Roman Jews. See Breitman, et al. (2005), p. 80. had gone to Pope Pius' personal liaison to the German occupational authorities, Pankratius Pfeiffer, asking him to urge the Pope to intervene and limit reprisals on the grounds that they would inflame the Roman population and make the occupation (and negotiations for a separate peace with the Allies they all fervently wished for) even more difficult.: \\"Whether the Vatican first learned of a looming reprisal from Father Pankratius Pfeiffer on the night of the 23rd or from Ferrero, the official of the Governatorio, the following morning, seems only marginally relevant now, but, as already noted, until the 1980 release of the Vatican document by which it was informed that a ten-for-one reprisal was foreseen, it had maintained having no knowledge whatsoever of a German retaliation plan.\\" According to Katz, the Secretariat of the Vatican believed that \\"the attack on Via Rasella had been undertaken to provoke the occupiers into an excessively repressive act and increase the people's hatred of the Germans.. \\"This was what the Pope's liaison Padre Pancrazio had been told in the Vatican the night before [the reprisal]. It was also the opinion held by Dollman and M√∂llhausen. None of them seemed to believe that the Partisans meant to hurt the Germans as never before to extend the popularity of the Resistance\\" nor did they view the Via Rasella attack as a legitimate act of war. Instead, they viewed it as a tragic act of terrorism by Communists, as did the Vatican, and as some of its defenders still do. According to Joseph Lichten, author of a monograph defending Pius XII written after the publication of Rolf Hochhuth's play, The Deputy: In the aftermath of the massacre, Pope Pius XII debated whether to protest against the massacre but decided not to because, as one of his defenders reported, \\"all the convents, all the religious houses of Rome were full of refugees, Communists, Jews, democrats and anti-Fascists, ex-generals, etc. Pius XII had even suspended the rules for the cloister. If Pius XII had made a public protest, there would have been searches in all these houses and catastrophe would have ensued\\".Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, S.D.B., Vatican Secretary of State, Hitler's Pope? A Judgment Historically Unsustainable: A look past exploitative polemics to the greatness of the man Eugenio Pacelli, Secretary of State and Roman Pontiff (speech), reproduced in the Osservatore Romano weekly edition in English (19 November 2008), p. 11. Instead, a special editorial entitled \\"The Deeds in Via Rasella\\" appeared in the \\"semi-official\\" Vatican newspaper, the Osservatore Romano, deploring the violence of \\"the guilty parties who escaped arrest\\" (presumably the Partisans, however Stephen Walker in his book Hide and Seek writes that \\"the wording is worthy of examination\\" and speculates that this is a reference to \\"the Nazis who rounded up over 300 people and then butchered them.\\") and urging Roman citizens to continue to exercise restraint to prevent further sacrifices of innocent people. \\"In the face of such deeds every honest heart is left profoundly grieved in the name of humanity and Christian sentiment. Thirty-two victims on the one hand, and on the other, three-hundred-and-twenty persons sacrificed for the guilty parties who escaped arrest.\\", calls this a \\"perverse declaration of good and evil\\". Subsequently, the Nazi Occupation forces stepped up their hunt among Roman civilians for suspected Resistance supporters, whom it rounded up and tortured. Controversy In 1952, the new Italian Supreme Court declared the Via Rasella attack to have been a legitimate act of war after an appeal by Kappler's lawyers of his conviction of guilt in the Ardeatine Massacre. This decision was reaffirmed in 1999, when the Italian Supreme Court declared the Partisans immune from prosecution after a Roman prosecutor had unsuccessfully attempted to bring a suit against them for the death of the boy Piero Zuccheretti, who had been killed in Via Rasella.Katz (2005), n. 31, p. 390. Historian Robert Wolfe finds \\"persuasive\\" Katz's characterisation of the Pope's decision to condemn the Partisans for the Via Rasella attack, rather than the Nazis for the reprisals, as evidence of \\"a moral failure\\" resulting from one of the \\"great misreadings of history\\".. In the 1990s, there was a revisionist campaign by Il Giornale, a newspaper owned by Paolo Berlusconi, brother of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, to re-label the World War II Partisans responsible for the attack on Via Rasella as \\"terrorists\\". In response, the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation officially ruled that the act in Via Rasella had been a legitimate act of war and not a terrorist attack and ordered the publisher to pay punitive damages of 45 thousand euro.See Via Rasella: the truth and the liar. Silvio Berlusconi's election in 1994 was the motivation for Alessandro Portelli to write his seminal 1999 work, L'ordine √® stato eseguito [The Order Has Been Carried Out] (). , decries the continuing denial of the nature of the massacre in the following terms: \\"We are up against something that is close to a mythical, semi- religious belief in the guilt of the partisans and in the innocence of the Nazis. I think this is an amazing situation. Italy is probably the only country in the world that goes to the length of lying to itself in order to absolve its occupiers and massacrers.\\" Nevertheless, some historians, such as Richard Raiber and Istv√°n De√°k, continue to imply that the Partisans were the equivalent of terrorists and were, moreover, responsible for avoidable suffering, thus offering some support for the official judgment of the Vatican at the time.For a review of Raiber's book see the History Network website. For De√†k see Istv√°n De√°k, \\"Resistance\\", The New Republic, 22 March 2004, and infra. Historian Patrick Gallo, however, in For Love and Country: The Italian Resistance (2003), posited that the Rome-based Resistance not only undermined German morale but also achieved important strategic objectives and was hence not a useless provocation, as contended by critics, but an act of legitimate military significance in furthering the Allied victory.Patrick Gallo, For Love and Country: The Italian Resistance, Lanham, Md., University Press of America, 2003. Reviewing Katz's book, The Battle for Rome, Istv√°n De√°k, on the other hand, cautions that although \\"armed resistance during World War II was romanticised because the Nazis were such an appalling enemy, and because in that war the guerrillas' targets were still mainly soldiers\\", it is increasingly hard to draw the line between freedom fighting and terrorism. In his opinion, Hague Conventions regulating irregular warfare has been \\"more a failure than success.\\" \\"What is needed,\\" De√°k stresses, \\"is a recognition of reality, namely that future wars will increasingly consist of civilians shooting at soldiers from hiding and frightened soldiers killing innocent civilians. And what is needed, in the aftermath of such a sobering recognition, is an attempt to create a new international law for the more efficient regulation of this type of horrible warfare.\\" Robert Katz's book, The Battle for Rome, De√°k concludes, \\"provides fine arguments for this necessary debate\\". Istv√°n De√°k, \\"Resistance\\", The New Republic, 22 March 2004. Post-war fates of leading figures in the events Immediately after the war Roman Partisan leaders, including Rosario Bentivegna, the medical student who had set off the Via Rasella bomb, were recipients of medals conferred by the post-war Italian government. Both Priebke and Kappler sought Vatican assistance after the war. Priebke escaped from a British prison camp in 1946 and fled, first to the Tyrol and then back to Rome, whence, using false papers supplied by the Vatican \\"ratline\\", he emigrated to Argentina. He was unmasked on camera in 1994 during a television interview by ABC television reporter Sam Donaldson, brought back to Italy for trial, and sentenced to house arrest in the home of his lawyer, Paolo Giachini. He died on 11 October 2013 from natural causes at age 100. His last request to have his remains returned to Argentina to be buried alongside his wife was denied by Argentina. The Vatican issued an \\"unprecedented ban\\" on holding the funeral in any Catholic church in Rome.\\"Nazi war criminal Priebke's funeral halted amid protests\\", BBC News, 16 October 2013. But the Society of St Pius X, a Catholic splinter group often accused of having far-right and anti-Semitic leanings, offered to hold the ceremony in the city of Albano Laziale. During the funeral service, violent clashes broke out between fascist sympathisers and anti-fascist protesters. Don Florian Abrahamowicz, a priest expelled from the Society of St Pius X for his extreme right-wing views, told Italy's Radio 24: \\"Priebke was a friend of mine, a Christian, a faithful soldier.\\" Kappler, a Protestant until his late conversion in life, unsuccessfully sought asylum within the Vatican. Tried by the British and sentenced to life imprisonment in Gaeta, in 1977 he successfully escaped from a Roman military hospital where he had been undergoing treatment for cancer. He died unmolested the following year at his home in Soltau, West Germany, the West Germans having refused Italian requests to extradite him. Dramatisations The event was recreated in the 1962 film Dieci italiani per un tedesco (Via Rasella) (Ten Italians for One German (Rasella Street)) directed by Filippo Walter Ratti and starring Gino Cervi. In 1973, the feature film Massacre in Rome by George Pan Cosmatos was released starring Marcello Mastroianni and Richard Burton. American composer William Schuman subtitled his Ninth Symphony, from 1968, \\"Le fosse Ardeatine\\" (\\"The Ardeatine Caves\\") in memory of the victims. The 2017 novel entitled From Sand and Ash by Amy Harmon details a fictional account of the massacre.

A perpetrator in the Ardeatine massacre, in which 335 civilians were murdered, he was tried and convicted in Italy in 1998. He spent the last years of his life under limited house arrest in \\"the splendor of the beautiful Swiss Alps\\". Espionage Hass was born in Kiel. In 1934, Hass joined the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), the SS's intelligence service, where his ruthlessness brought promotion. After the downfall of Benito Mussolini and the occupation of Italy by Nazi Germany, Karl Hass was sent to Rome to set up a network of radio operators and to organize saboteurs behind the invading Allied lines. While in Rome, serving under SS- Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Herbert Kappler, Karl Hass aided in the deportation of more than 1,000 Jews to Auschwitz. Hass was also the officer who had Princess Mafalda of Savoy, the daughter of King Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy, placed into German military custody, which eventually resulted in her death. He reputedly lured her to his headquarters in Rome by the suggestion that there was a message from her husband who was then being held in Berlin. On her arrival at the German command, Hass had the princess arrested and sent for questioning to Munich in Germany. She was subsequently sent to Berlin and then to Buchenwald concentration camp, where she was later wounded in an Allied bombing raid. Despite receiving medical attention at the camp, she died following an operation to amputate her infected arm. Ardeatine massacre Following a 23 March 1944 bomb attack in the Via Rasella by Italian resistance fighters that killed 33 soldiers, Hass, Capt. Erich Priebke and fellow officers rounded up 335 Italians and the next day transported them to the Ardeatine caves at the outskirts of Rome. Hass, Priebke, and their soldiers systematically executed each captive with a shot to the back of the head. The Ardeatine massacre is one of the most notorious in the Italian history of World War II. Post-war After the war, SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Hass was taken prisoner by the Allies, but rather than being brought to justice for his war crimes, he was apparently employed by the United States Army Counter Intelligence Corps to spy on the Soviet Union. Only Kappler was charged with the Ardeatine cave massacre. In the early 1990s, Priebke, who had helped Hass with the executions, was interviewed in Argentina by an American television crew and as a result of the ensuing uproar in Italy was eventually extradited to stand trial. Hass returned to Italy to testify against Priebke. However, on the night before he was due to testify, Hass decided against testifying against his old colleague, and attempted to flee from his hotel room by climbing down from an outside balcony. He seriously injured himself after slipping and falling from the balcony and was taken to hospital where he ultimately gave testimony to Court officials. In the court records, Hass admitted the execution of two civilians, but defended his actions by claiming he was only following orders, a defense which has been ruled invalid ever since the Nuremberg trials. Tried and convicted for his role in the Ardeatine action, he was sentenced to life in prison in 1998. Considered to be in poor health, Hass was held under limited house arrest in what was described as \\"a retirement villa in his favorite area of Switzerland\\" until his death in 2004.Obituary, independent.co.uk, 24 April 2004; accessed 7 December 2014.

The concept that black holes may exist that are smaller than stellar mass was introduced in 1971 by Stephen Hawking. It is possible that such quantum primordial black holes were created in the high- density environment of the early Universe (or Big Bang), or possibly through subsequent phase transitions. They might be observed by astrophysicists through the particles they are expected to emit by Hawking radiation. Some hypotheses involving additional space dimensions predict that micro black holes could be formed at energies as low as the TeV range, which are available in particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider. Popular concerns have then been raised over end-of-the-world scenarios (see Safety of particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider). However, such quantum black holes would instantly evaporate, either totally or leaving only a very weakly interacting residue. Beside the theoretical arguments, the cosmic rays hitting the Earth do not produce any damage, although they reach energies in the range of hundreds of TeV.  Minimum mass of a black hole  In principle, a black hole can have any mass equal to or above about or 22 micrograms (the Planck mass). To make a black hole, one must concentrate mass or energy sufficiently that the escape velocity from the region in which it is concentrated exceeds the speed of light. This condition gives the Schwarzschild radius, , where is the gravitational constant, is the speed of light, and the mass of the black hole. On the other hand, the Compton wavelength, , where is the Planck constant, represents a limit on the minimum size of the region in which a mass at rest can be localized. For sufficiently small , the reduced Compton wavelength (, where is the reduced Planck constant) exceeds half the Schwarzschild radius, and no black hole description exists. This smallest mass for a black hole is thus approximately the Planck mass. Some extensions of present physics posit the existence of extra dimensions of space. In higher- dimensional spacetime, the strength of gravity increases more rapidly with decreasing distance than in three dimensions. With certain special configurations of the extra dimensions, this effect can lower the Planck scale to the TeV range. Examples of such extensions include large extra dimensions, special cases of the Randall‚ÄìSundrum model, and string theory configurations like the GKP solutions. In such scenarios, black hole production could possibly be an important and observable effect at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It would also be a common natural phenomenon induced by cosmic rays. All this assumes that the theory of general relativity remains valid at these small distances. If it does not, then other, presently unknown, effects might limit the minimum size of a black hole. Elementary particles are equipped with a quantum-mechanical, intrinsic angular momentum (spin). The correct conservation law for the total (orbital plus spin) angular momentum of matter in curved spacetime requires that spacetime is equipped with torsion. The simplest and most natural theory of gravity with torsion is the Einstein‚ÄìCartan theory. Torsion modifies the Dirac equation in the presence of the gravitational field and causes fermion particles to be spatially extended. In this case the spatial extension of fermions limits the minimum mass of a black hole to be on the order of , showing that micro black holes may not exist. The energy necessary to produce such a black hole is 39 orders of magnitude greater than the energies available at the Large Hadron Collider, indicating that the LHC cannot produce mini black holes. But if black holes are produced, then the theory of general relativity is proven wrong and does not exist at these small distances. The rules of general relativity would be broken, as is consistent with theories of how matter, space, and time break down around the event horizon of a black hole. This would prove the spatial extensions of the fermion limits to be incorrect as well. The fermion limits assume a minimum mass needed to sustain a black hole, as opposed to the opposite, the minimum mass needed to start a black hole, which in theory is achievable in the LHC under some conditions.  Stability   Hawking radiation  In 1975, Stephen Hawking argued that, due to quantum effects, black holes \\"evaporate\\" by a process now referred to as Hawking radiation in which elementary particles (such as photons, electrons, quarks, gluons) are emitted. His calculations showed that the smaller the size of the black hole, the faster the evaporation rate, resulting in a sudden burst of particles as the micro black hole suddenly explodes. Any primordial black hole of sufficiently low mass will evaporate to near the Planck mass within the lifetime of the Universe. In this process, these small black holes radiate away matter. A rough picture of this is that pairs of virtual particles emerge from the vacuum near the event horizon, with one member of a pair being captured, and the other escaping the vicinity of the black hole. The net result is the black hole loses mass (due to conservation of energy). According to the formulae of black hole thermodynamics, the more the black hole loses mass, the hotter it becomes, and the faster it evaporates, until it approaches the Planck mass. At this stage, a black hole would have a Hawking temperature of (), which means an emitted Hawking particle would have an energy comparable to the mass of the black hole. Thus, a thermodynamic description breaks down. Such a micro black hole would also have an entropy of only 4 nats, approximately the minimum possible value. At this point then, the object can no longer be described as a classical black hole, and Hawking's calculations also break down. While Hawking radiation is sometimes questioned, Leonard Susskind summarizes an expert perspective in his book The Black Hole War: \\"Every so often, a physics paper will appear claiming that black holes don't evaporate. Such papers quickly disappear into the infinite junk heap of fringe ideas.\\"  Conjectures for the final state  Conjectures for the final fate of the black hole include total evaporation and production of a Planck-mass- sized black hole remnant. Such Planck-mass black holes may in effect be stable objects if the quantized gaps between their allowed energy levels bar them from emitting Hawking particles or absorbing energy gravitationally like a classical black hole. In such case, they would be weakly interacting massive particles; this could explain dark matter.  Primordial black holes   Formation in the early Universe  Production of a black hole requires concentration of mass or energy within the corresponding Schwarzschild radius. It was hypothesized by Zel'dovich and Novikov first and independently by Hawking that, shortly after the Big Bang, the Universe was dense enough for any given region of space to fit within its own Schwarzschild radius. Even so, at that time, the Universe was not able to collapse into a singularity due to its uniform mass distribution and rapid growth. This, however, does not fully exclude the possibility that black holes of various sizes may have emerged locally. A black hole formed in this way is called a primordial black hole and is the most widely accepted hypothesis for the possible creation of micro black holes. Computer simulations suggest that the probability of formation of a primordial black hole is inversely proportional to its mass. Thus, the most likely outcome would be micro black holes.  Expected observable effects  A primordial black hole with an initial mass of around would be completing its evaporation today; a less massive primordial black hole would have already evaporated. Under optimal conditions, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope satellite, launched in June 2008, might detect experimental evidence for evaporation of nearby black holes by observing gamma ray bursts. It is unlikely that a collision between a microscopic black hole and an object such as a star or a planet would be noticeable. The small radius and high density of the black hole would allow it to pass straight through any object consisting of normal atoms, interacting with only few of its atoms while doing so. It has, however, been suggested that a small black hole of sufficient mass passing through the Earth would produce a detectable acoustic or seismic signal.The Schwarzschild radius of a black hole is approximately (), which is much smaller than an atom but larger than an atomic nucleus.  Human-made micro black holes   Feasibility of production  In familiar three- dimensional gravity, the minimum energy of a microscopic black hole is (equivalent to 1.6 GJ or 444 kWh), which would have to be condensed into a region on the order of the Planck length. This is far beyond the limits of any current technology. It is estimated that to collide two particles to within a distance of a Planck length with currently achievable magnetic field strengths would require a ring accelerator about 1,000 light years in diameter to keep the particles on track. Stephen Hawking also said in chapter 6 of his A Brief History of Time that physicist John Archibald Wheeler once calculated that a very powerful hydrogen bomb using all the deuterium in all the water on Earth could also generate such a black hole, but Hawking does not provide this calculation or any reference to it to support this assertion. However, in some scenarios involving extra dimensions of space, the Planck mass can be as low as the TeV range. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has a design energy of for proton‚Äìproton collisions and 1,150 TeV for Pb‚ÄìPb collisions. It was argued in 2001 that, in these circumstances, black hole production could be an important and observable effect at the LHC or future higher-energy colliders. Such quantum black holes should decay emitting sprays of particles that could be seen by detectors at these facilities. A paper by Choptuik and Pretorius, published in 2010 in Physical Review Letters, presented a computer-generated proof that micro black holes must form from two colliding particles with sufficient energy, which might be allowable at the energies of the LHC if additional dimensions are present other than the customary four (three spatial, one temporal).  Safety arguments  Hawking's calculation and more general quantum mechanical arguments predict that micro black holes evaporate almost instantaneously. Additional safety arguments beyond those based on Hawking radiation were given in the paper, which showed that in hypothetical scenarios with stable black holes that could damage Earth, such black holes would have been produced by cosmic rays and would have already destroyed known astronomical objects such as the Earth, Sun, neutron stars, or white dwarfs.  Black holes in quantum theories of gravity  It is possible, in some theories of quantum gravity, to calculate the quantum corrections to ordinary, classical black holes. Contrarily to conventional black holes, which are solutions of gravitational field equations of the general theory of relativity, quantum gravity black holes incorporate quantum gravity effects in the vicinity of the origin, where classically a curvature singularity occurs. According to the theory employed to model quantum gravity effects, there are different kinds of quantum gravity black holes, namely loop quantum black holes, non-commutative black holes, asymptotically safe black holes. In these approaches, black holes are singularity-free. Virtual micro black holes were proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1995 and by Fabio Scardigli in 1999 as part of a Grand Unified Theory as a quantum gravity candidate.

He represented Victoria a record 31 times in interstate football, and was named as one of the inaugural Legends when the Australian Football Hall of Fame was established in 1996. Nicholls played most of his football as a ruckman, and although at 189 centimetres he was not especially tall, he compensated his lack of height with his intelligence and imposing physical presence, which earned him the nickname 'Big Nick'. His rivalry with fellow Australian football legend Graham Farmer raised the standard of ruck play during the 1960s. Carlton career The Carlton Football Club recruited Nicholls from the Maryborough Football Club in 1957 after recruiting his elder brother, Don, the previous year their father ensured that both brothers would play together at one club. Don played 77 senior games as a centreman for Carlton from 1956, when he was Carlton's best first-year player, to 1961.Don Nicholls Profile Nicholls enjoyed an outstanding season in 1966, winning his second consecutive Robert Reynolds Trophy, and finishing second in the Brownlow Medal count, four votes behind St Kilda champion Ian Stewart. Success as captain-coach In his first year as captain-coach, Nicholls led the Blues to the minor premiership with 18 wins and a draw, followed by with 18 wins. 1972 was the first season in which the McIntyre \\"Final Five\\" system was used, and so because Carlton finished on top of the ladder, this meant that they had to wait until the semi-final, in which they faced Richmond. The match was drawn, which in those days meant that a replay was required the following week, thus shifting every other match back another week. Richmond won the replay by 41 points, but in the post-match interviews Nicholls refused to panic: > Carlton has not hit a form slump. We just had a dismal day ‚Äì our worst for > the season. [...] There'll be no panic just because we went down by 41 > points. There won't be more than one or two changes. [...] We will be > sticking to the same players because it was they who put us where we > finished at the end of the home-and-away games. [...] I know the players > will redeem themselves next week. We just won't beat St. Kilda ‚Äì we will win > well. And if we team together as I know we can I know we are good enough to > take the premiership. Robert Walls, who was serving as vice-captain, recalled that the day after the semi-final defeat, the players arrived at training feeling flat, but Nicholls revealed to them the outline of his plan to win the premiership with all-out attacking football. But first, Carlton had to defeat in the Preliminary Final. The Saints had played in the previous year's Grand Final and still boasted a strong team. Nicholls chose not to implement his plan, trusting that his players would get the job done. The Blues prevailed by 16 points and earned the right to redeem themselves against their arch-rival. Richmond went into the Grand Final as clear favourites, but this would be the day when Nicholls established once and for all his reputation as one of the greats of the game. The element of surprise in Nicholls' plan lay in his team selection; he handed the rucking responsibilities to \\"Percy\\" Jones, whilst stationing himself in the forward pocket with the intent of kicking goals. He also deployed Barry Armstrong in the centre while Vin Waite was given the task of minding Barry Richardson. Finally, in the lead-up to the match, Nicholls had given his players three simple instructions: get to the ball first, kick long into attack and contest for 100 minutes. The plan succeeded in the most spectacular fashion possible. In an enthralling spectacle of attacking football from both teams, Carlton piled on the goals to lead at half time with an incredible score of 18.6 (114) to 10.9 (69). The shell-shocked Tigers tried to claw their way back into the game, but every goal they scored was met with a Carlton reply. When the final siren sounded, Carlton had registered a record score of 28.9 (177) while Richmond's score of 22.18 (150), enough to win most games, remains the highest losing score in a Grand Final. While every Carlton player contributed, Nicholls himself had a field day, kicking six goals on Ray Boyanich. He said afterwards that had he not kicked six, he felt he would have failed in the position. Walls, who also kicked six goals, was nominated best on ground. Stung by their defeat, Richmond didn't have to wait long to avenge their humiliation as the two rivals squared off again in the following season's Grand Final. On a hot and blustery day, Richmond prevailed in a match that would be remembered for two major incidents. The first occurred at the three- minute mark of the first quarter, when Nicholls was sensationally felled by Richmond back pocket Laurie Fowler while juggling a mark. Both players had their eyes on the ball and didn't see each other until it was too late. Fowler, who was airborne, hit Nicholls with his shoulder and emerged from the collision unscathed, but Nicholls went to ground and had to be helped to his feet by the club trainers. The sight of their fallen leader stunned the Carlton players; Robert Walls recalled that \\"[t]here was a bit of disbelief when Nicholls went down because we'd never seen the big bloke hurt like that before.\\" Nicholls was awarded a 15-metre penalty, and goaled from the free kick, but suffered double vision from the collision, and had little further impact on the game. The second incident came in the second quarter, when Ian Stewart kicked the ball deep into Richmond's attacking zone to a contest involving Carlton full- back Geoff Southby and Richmond forward Neil Balme. What happened next would sour Carlton's already bitter relations with Richmond for many years. Going for the ball after it spilled off a pack contest, Southby was floored by a round-arm punch from Balme. The hit broke Southby's jaw, and he would not return to the field after half time. Just moments later, Balme would lash out again, this time at Vin Waite. Reflecting on the incident many years later, Nicholls angrily labelled Balme a \\"cheat\\": > I didn't respect him as a player because I reckon he was a cheat. He used to > dwell on players and with his big, strong frame, he should have been doing > more courageous things. People over the years say Balmey knocked a couple > out, but he basically king-hit people. Controversies While playing for Carlton, Nicholls served a 3-month jail term at Pentridge Prison in 1960, having been found guilty of the embezzlement of ‚Ç§5,558 from the Collins Street Branch of the E.S.&A.; Bank, and larceny as a servant, and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment (with an eligibility for parole after three months),Star Footballer Gaoled for Embezzlement, The Age, April 8, 1960, p.4. he missed the first eleven games of the 1960 season, returning to play against Richmond on July 16, 1960.Fiery Quarter Lifts Dull Game, The Age, July 18, 1960, p.18. Retirement and Further coaching Nicholls finished his VFL career with a then-record 331 games (three state games played during Carlton games were added to his 328 Carlton games). Following his retirement, he served as non-playing coach at Carlton in 1975, but then resigned three days before the start of the 1976 VFL season, citing mental and physical exhaustion.Cartledge, 2013, p. 59 Nicholls then went to South Australia, where he coached Glenelg Football Club, from 1977‚Äì1978, and then returned to Melbourne to coach Coburg Football Club in 1981. Life after Football Nicholls has remained loyal to Carlton, even through the recent lean years. In August 2010, at a function to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Carlton's memorable 1970 premiership, Nicholls took the opportunity to voice his displeasure at the way Carlton had been run by previous administrators since the 1995 premiership, which eventually led, among other things, to the club's first wooden spoon in 2002: > The thing that annoys me more at the moment about Carlton is our lack of > respect, generally, in the footballing public. I know that, without going > right through all the 50-odd years, I have seen a lot of good committees > come and go. I have seen a lot of good players come and go, but there is a > lack of respect and, to me, a trashing of the Carlton brand in the past 10 > or 15 years. During Carlton's 150th anniversary celebration in June 2014, at which he was named the club's greatest player, Nicholls went further, saying that the club needed to lose its arrogant image: > But I must say, if I have one regret about the image of Carlton, who I love, > it is the fact that we have probably taken over from Collingwood as being > the most hated side in the league. I say that because people think we were > arrogant, which we were ‚Äì thanks to a couple of presidents. Without > mentioning any names, they were arrogant. When we won, they didn‚Äôt know how > to win properly. I believe that's the thing about sport ‚Äì you have got to > know how to win and how to lose and do both properly. We were arrogant. I > think that helped create an image of the club, being an arrogant club, which > I don‚Äôt think we are. Honours and Tributes Nicholls won the Robert Reynolds Trophy for Carlton's best and fairest player on five occasions: 1959, only his third season, and then in 1963, 1965, 1966 and 1967. In the eleven seasons from 1959 to 1969, Nicholls never placed outside the top three for the award. The trophy was renamed in Nicholls' honour in 2004. He was also named in Carlton's Team of the Century in the first ruck.Team of the Century Besides being named as one of the twelve inaugural \\"Legends of the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, Nicholls was also named in the AFL Team of the Century, as the resting ruckman in the back pocket, with Graham Farmer taking the first ruck position.AFL Record Guide to Season 2005; Lovett, Michael (editor); p493 He is depicted contesting a boundary throw-in against Farmer in Jamie Cooper's painting the Game That Made Australia, commissioned by the AFL in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the sport. Teammate and fellow Legend Alex Jesaulenko rated Nicholls the best he had seen or played with, \\"because he could have two marks and four kicks and still win a game.\\" Former Collingwood captain Des Tuddenham said that Nicholls had the best football brain of anyone he had met. Carlton rover Rod Ashman recounted the impact Nicholls had during his early years at the club: > Playing alongside \\"Big Nick\\" was an absolute godsend. I got him at the end > of his career, but I'll never forget one day at Carlton at a boundary throw- > in, right in front of the social club in the forward pocket.

Henry Award winner. Early years The granddaughter of a publisher, Boyle was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, and grew up in several cities but principally in Cincinnati, Ohio. Her father, Howard Peterson Boyle, was a lawyer, but her greatest influence came from her mother, Katherine Evans, a literary and social activist who believed that the wealthy had an obligation to help the financially less fortunate. In later years Kay Boyle championed integration and civil rights. She advocated banning nuclear weapons, and American withdrawal from the Vietnam War. Boyle was educated at the exclusive Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, then studied architecture at the Ohio Mechanics Institute in Cincinnati. Interested in the arts, she studied violin at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music before settling in New York City in 1922 where she found work as a writer/editor with a small magazine. Marriages and family life That same year, she met and married a French exchange student, Richard Brault, and they moved to France in 1923. This resulted in her staying in Europe for the better part of the next twenty years. Separated from her husband, she formed a relationship with magazine editor Ernest Walsh, with whom she had a daughter, Sharon, named for the Rose of Sharon, in March 1927, five months after Walsh's death from tuberculosis in October 1926. In 1928 she met Laurence Vail, who was then married to Peggy Guggenheim. Boyle and Vail lived together between 1929 until 1932 when, following their divorces, they married. With Vail, she had three more children - daughters Apple-Joan in 1929, Kathe in 1934, and Clover in 1939. During her years in France, Boyle was associated with several innovative literary magazines and made friends with many of the writers and artists living in Paris around Montparnasse. Among her friends were Harry and Caresse Crosby who owned the Black Sun Press and published her first work of fiction, a collection titled Short Stories. They became such good friends that in 1928 Harry Crosby cashed in some stock dividends to help Boyle pay for an abortion. Other friends included Eugene and Maria Jolas. Boyle also wrote for transition, one of the preeminent literary publications of the day. A poet as well as a novelist, her early writings often reflected her lifelong search for true love as well as her interest in the power relationships between men and women. Boyle's short stories won two O. Henry Awards. In 1936, she wrote a novel, Death of a Man, an attack on the growing threat of Nazism. In 1943, following her divorce from Laurence Vail, she married Baron Joseph von Franckenstein, with whom she had two children - Faith in 1942 and Ian in 1943. After having lived in France, Austria, England, and in Germany after World War II, Boyle returned to the United States. McCarthyism, later life In the States, Boyle and her husband were victims of early 1950s McCarthyism. Her husband was dismissed by Roy Cohn from his post in the Public Affairs Division of the United States Department of State, and Boyle lost her position as foreign correspondent for The New Yorker, a post she had held for six years. She was blacklisted by most of the major magazines. During this period, her life and writing became increasingly political. She and her husband were cleared by the United States Department of State in 1957. In the early 1960s, Boyle and her husband lived in Rowayton, Connecticut, where he taught at a private girls' school. He was then rehired by the State Department and posted to Iran, but died shortly thereafter in 1963. Boyle was a writer in residence at the New York City Writer's Conference at Wagner College in 1962. In 1963, she accepted a creative writing position on the faculty of San Francisco State College, where she remained until 1979. Kay Boyle with Bay Area historian Connie Young Yu in San Francisco, 1976. During this period she became heavily involved in political activism. She traveled to Cambodia in 1966 as part of the \\"Americans Want to Know\\" fact-seeking mission. She participated in numerous protests, and in 1967 was arrested twice and imprisoned. In 1968, she signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.Writers and Editors War Tax Protest page 2. In her later years, she became an active supporter of Amnesty International and worked for the NAACP. After retiring from San Francisco State College, Boyle held several writer-in-residence positions for brief periods of time, including at Eastern Washington University in Cheney and the University of Oregon in Eugene. Boyle died at a retirement community in Mill Valley, California on December 27, 1992. Legacy In her lifetime Kay Boyle published more than 40 books, including 14 novels, eight volumes of poetry, 11 collections of short fiction, three children's books, and French to English translations and essays.

It drains a timber-producing area of the Northern Oregon Coast Range west of Portland. Rising in the mountains of western Yamhill County, it is impounded near its headwaters to create McGuire Reservoir, the primary water source for the city of McMinnville. The river flows generally west through Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land and the Siuslaw National Forest, past Beaver, then southwest past Hebo and Cloverdale. It enters Nestucca Bay, on the Pacific Ocean, from the north at Pacific City. The Little Nestucca River does not join the Nestucca but enters Nestucca Bay from the south.

It flows generally northwest, through the Siuslaw National Forest and enters Nestucca Bay on the Pacific near Pacific City. The Little Nestucca River crosses under the U.S. Route 101 just three miles south of Pacific City and is paralleled for much of its length by County Road 130. It enters Nestucca Bay at the south end, independently of the Nestucca River which enters from the north end. They flow approximately parallel, and at their nearest, are about two miles apart. Fishing The Little Nestucca River offers steelhead. A few stray hatchery steelhead are present throughout the winter season. Wild fish may be caught and released through the winter, with the run peaking in March. Limited public access is available along Little Nestucca River Road between Highway 22 and Highway 101. The Little Nestucca River joins the Nestucca River from the south just before it flows into the Pacific Ocean. Only the headwaters are in public ownership‚Äîbeing managed by the Forest Service‚Äîwith most of the primary fishing areas located on private lands.

Upton Falls Upton Falls was historically the upstream limit of migration for native fish, but the falls have been altered to include a fish ladder and a small embankment dam to divert the water to the ladder. There is a swimming hole downstream of the falls. The waterfall was originally most likely similar to Stella Falls, located a mile upstream. The falls apparently were named for James B. Upton, a nearby homesteader who owned and operated a farm in the area. Upton Falls is adjacent to the Little Nestucca Highway, just over three miles inland from Highway 101. The falls are clear to westbound traffic. Parking is available for only a few cars. Scramble paths lead down from the road to the river, but they are steep and generally unstable.

It is located in southwestern Tillamook County, approximately southwest of Tillamook, just south of Netarts Bay. The promontory extends perpendicular to the coast, and is approximately wide at its base, tapering as it extends outward from the coast. Cape Lookout State Park is located on the north side of the promontory, which is part of the Siuslaw National Forest. Cape Lookout Road travels past the base of the cape. Cape Lookout is a member of Tillamook's Three Capes Scenic Drive. The Cape Lookout Trail is a popular hiking trail, extending through Sitka spruce forest to the tip of the promontory. The cliff-top hiking trail offers views of Cape Kiwanda and Cascade Head to the south as well as Cape Meares, Three Arch Rocks, and Neahkahnie Mountain to the north. Migrating whales can also be seen, generally from December through June, as they pass the end of the cape. The cape was named on July 6, 1788 by British fur trader John Meares, who was sailing south from Nootka Island, Canada in search of trade. During World War II, the cape was the location of a notable crash of a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber. There was one survivor (the bombardier), Wilbur L. Perez.

It has numerous common names, including dame's rocket, damask- violet, dame's-violet, dames-wort, dame's gilliflower, night-scented gilliflower, queen's gilliflower, rogue's gilliflower, summer lilac, sweet rocket, mother-of-the-evening, and winter gilliflower. These plants are biennials or short-lived perennials, native to Eurasia and cultivated in many other areas of the world for their attractive, spring-blooming flowers. In some of those areas, it has escaped from cultivation and become a weed species. The genus name Hesperis was probably given because the scent of the flowers becomes more conspicuous towards evening (Hespera is the Greek word for evening). Description Hesperis matronalis grows 100 cm or taller, with multiple upright, hairy stems. Typically, the first year of growth produces a mound of foliage, and flowering occurs the second year; the plants are normally biennials, but a number of races can be short-lived perennials. The plants have showy blooms in early to mid spring. The leaves are alternately arranged on upright stems and lanceolate-shaped; they typically have very short or lack petioles and have toothed margins, but sometimes are entire and are widest at the base. The foliage has short hairs on the top and bottom surfaces that give the leaves a somewhat rough feel. The larger leaves are around 12 cm long and over 4 cm wide. In early spring, a thick mound of low- growing foliage is produced; during flowering the lower parts of the stems are generally unbranched and denuded of foliage and the top of the blooming plant might have a few branches that end in inflorescences. The plentiful, fragrant flowers are produced in large, showy, terminal racemes that can be 30+ cm tall and elongate as the flowers of the inflorescence bloom. When stems have both flowers and fruits, the weight sometimes causes the stems to bend. Each flower is large (2 cm across), with four petals. Flower coloration varies, with different shades of lavender and purple most common, but white, pink, and even some flowers with mixed colors exist in cultivated forms. A few different double-flowered varieties also exist. The four petals are clawed and hairless. The flowers have six stamens in two groups, the four closest to the ovary are longer than the two oppositely positioned. Stigmas are two-lobed. The four sepals are erect and form a mock tube around the claws of the petals and are also colored similarly to the petals. Some plants may bloom until August, but warm weather greatly shortens the duration on each flower's blooming. Seeds are produced in thin fruits 5‚Äì14 cm long pods, containing two rows of seeds separated by a dimple. The fruit are terete and open by way of glabrous valves, constricted between the seeds like a pea pod. Seeds are oblong, 3‚Äì4 mm long and 1‚Äì1.5 mm wide. In North America, Hesperis matronalis is often confused with native Phlox species that also have similar large showy flower clusters. They can be distinguished from each other by foliage and flower differences: dame's rocket has alternately arranged leaves and four petals per flower, while phloxes have opposite leaves and five petals. Stand of dame's rocket in a forested setting Naturalized Sweet Rocket, Whitelands Wood, Butser Hill, England Cultivation Hesperis matronalis has been a cultivated species for a long time, and grows best in full sun to partial shade where soils are moist with good drainage. It is undemanding and self-seeds quickly, forming dense stands. Extensive monotypic stands of dame's rocket are visible from great distances; these dense collections of plants have the potential to crowd out native species when growing outside of cultivated areas. The successful spread of dame's rocket in North America is attributed to its prolific seed production and because the seeds are often included in prepackaged \\"wildflower seed\\" mixes sold for \\"naturalizing\\". The plants typically produce a low-lying rosette of foliage the first year; in subsequent years, blooming and seed production occurs in tandem throughout the blooming season. This species is commonly found in roadside ditches, dumps and in open woodland settings, where it is noticed when in bloom. Although it makes an attractive, hardy garden plant, it has been found to be ecologically invasive in North America. Hesperis matronalis is propagated by seeds, but desirable individuals, including the double-flowering forms, are propagated from cuttings or division of the clumps. Young leaves are high in vitamin C and can be eaten in salads and have a slightly bitter taste. Seeds can be sprouted and also eaten in salads.https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/hesperis- matronalis/https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Hesperis+matronalis Distribution A garden escape, H. matronalis is found in many areas of Ireland,Scannell, M.

Summary The essay is based on Weber's observations of American businessmen in 1904, during a trip he took to visit relatives in Ohio and North Carolina, and to do research in the libraries of American universities that had Protestant affiliations. Despite the strict Separation of Church and State in the US, businessmen never failed to ask (casually) about each other's religious affiliations. Weber eventually realized that this odd custom (from a European point of view) acted as a kind of \\"credit check\\". Protestant Sects and The Spirit of Capitalism, p1. This worked for two reasons. First, membership in a Protestant sect was voluntary (unlike the state-sponsored Churches in Europe), and they only accepted members who had demonstrated a certain standard of behavior. Any member who failed to behave as expected would face pressure to reform, or lose his membership. Therefore, any member in good standing could be trusted in business (regardless of which sect he belonged to). Protestant Sects and the Spirit of Capitalism, p3. Second, the Protestant sects were run by their members, and the pastor was their employee (unlike state-sponsored Churches, where the pastor might be a political appointee). If a pastor became lax or corrupt, the members could replace him. Congregations also insisted that their pastors should preach ethics, rather than the finer points of religious dogma (which they considered to be less important than ethical behavior). Protestant Sects and The Spirit of Capitalism, p7-8. As the influence of religion declined (particularly in the larger cities), this function had been taken up by secular businessmen's organizations. Again, these organizations only accepted members who demonstrated a certain standard of behavior, and that standard was enforced by the members rather than the hierarchy. Traveling salesmen would always be sure to wear a lapel pin indicating membership in one organization or another, because without such an affiliation, people wouldn't trust them. Joining such an organization was often a sign that an immigrant was becoming assimilated into American culture. Protestant Sects and The Spirit of Capitalism, p7. Both the religious and secular versions of this phenomenon were already dying out in the larger cities. In his book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Weber theorized that having a large number of businessmen who could be counted on to behave ethically was important to the growth of Capitalism, and that this had its origins in the Protestant Reformation (particularly in Calvinism and its spiritual descendants), although it had later become secularized.

The second lecture was \\"Politics as a Vocation\\" which was delivered in January 1919, also in Munich. Summary In Science as a Vocation, Weber weighed the benefits and detriments of choosing a career as an academic at a university who studies science or humanities. Weber probes the question \\"what is the value of science?\\" and focuses on the nature of ethics underpinning the scientific career. Science, to Weber, gives methods of explanation and means of justifying a position, but it cannot explain why that position is worth holding in the first place; this is the task of philosophy. No science is free from suppositions, and the value of a science is lost when its suppositions are rejected. Weber reasons that science can never answer the fundamental questions of life, such as directing people on how to live their lives and what to value. Value he contends can only be derived from personal beliefs such as religion. He further argues for the separation of reason and faith, noting that each has its place in respective field but if crossed over cannot work. Weber also separates fact from value in politics. He argues that a teacher should impart knowledge to students and teach them how to clarify issues logically - even political issues - but teachers should never use the classroom to indoctrinate or preach their personal political views. Weber also makes some practical comments about research and teaching. He notes that good scholars can be poor teachers, and that qualities that make one a good scholar, or a good thinker, are not necessarily the same qualities that make for good leaders or role models. Dating There has been some debate about when Weber delivered this lecture. Older sources often give the year as 1918. But based on a range of evidence scholars now think that Weber gave these lectures in 1917.Josephson-Storm, \\"A note on the dating of Max Weber‚Äôs Science as a Vocation‚Äù https://absolute-disruption.com/2017/10/24/a-note-on-the- dating-of-max-webers-science-as-a-vocation/ Translations Weber, Max (1946).

It originated in the second lecture of a series (the first was Science as a Vocation) he gave in Munich to the \\"Free (i.e. Non- incorporated) Students Union\\" of Bavaria on 28 January 1919. This happened during the German Revolution when Munich itself was briefly the capital of the Bavarian Socialist Republic. Weber gave the speech based on handwritten notes which were transcribed by a stenographer. The essay was published in an extended version in July 1919, and translated into English only after World War II. The essay is today regarded as a classic work of political science and sociology. Summary Weber defines the following: ‚ÄúThe state is seen as the sole grantor of the 'right' to physical force. Therefore, 'politics' in our case would mean the pursuit for a portion of power or for influencing the division of power whether it is between states, or between groups of people which the state encompasses.‚ÄùWeber 2015:136 Following this definition, Weber notes that there are three principles justifying the legitimacy of political domination of the state: traditional authority, charismatic authority, and legal authority.Weber 2015: 137-138 Much of the middle part of \\"Politics as a Vocation\\" consists of Weber‚Äôs definitions of charisma and leaders, and of the type of people who are called to the profession of politics.Weber 2015: 138-147 This is developed by lengthy historical descriptions of how modern politics emerged. Emphasis is placed on the historical examples of Great Britain, the United States, and Germany,Weber 2015: 148-179 though examples from France, China, Rome, Ancient Greece, and elsewhere are mentioned. In developing these examples, Weber demonstrates the extent of his grasp of comparative historical research. To do this, Weber describes the relationship between politicians, political parties, and the bureaucracies they create. In this section, Weber‚Äôs writing in ‚ÄúPolitics as a Vocation‚Äù is similar to his writing in another of his well-known essays, ‚ÄúBureaucracy.‚Äù In the final sectionWeber 2015:179-178 of \\"Politics as a Vocation\\", Weber returns to the description of the politician. His main point is that the politician needs to balance an ‚ÄúEthic of Moral Conviction‚Äù with an ‚ÄúEthic of Responsibility.‚Äù The Ethic of Moral Conviction refers to the core unshakeable beliefs that a politician must hold. The Ethic of Responsibility refers to the day-to-day need to use the means of the state‚Äôs violence in a fashion which preserves the peace for the greater good. A politician, Weber writes, must make compromises between these two ethics. To do this, Weber writes, \\"Politics is made with the head, not with the other parts of body, nor the soul\\".Weber 2015:181 The most effective politician is one who can excite the emotions of the people who follow, while governing strictly with a cold hard reason--the head. But, he believes, this is a task normal humans cannot do, because they are vain. Weber writes that vanity creates unique problems for politicians because they do indeed control the tools of legitimate violence.Weber 2015: 181-182 Common vanity, Weber writes, means that politicians are tempted to make decisions based on emotional attachments to followers and sycophants, and not on the rational reasoning needed to govern justly and effectively. Weber finds this to be a common characteristic among politicians. As a result, Weber claims, the danger of politics is rooted in the relationship of the politician to the means of violence which are intrinsic to the state, and which will be misused by any vain politician. This is why Weber emphasizes that the practice of politics is so difficult, and not a task for someone who seeks salvation for their eternal soul through the practice of peace and brotherhood. In developing these points, he makes reference to the two kingdoms doctrine of Martin Luther, and the Holy Hindu Upanishads. In the concluding sentences of the essay,Weber 2015:197-198 Weber comments on the German Revolution of 1919 which was underway when he wrote the essay. He gloomily predicts that the emotional excitement of the moment in 1919 will bring only ‚Äúpolar nights with an icy darkness and harshness, no matter what group will successfully seize power at present.‚Äù After saying this, Weber ends on a mildly optimistic note, writing that ‚ÄúOnly the person who is sure that he will not despair when the world, from his standpoint of view, is too simpleminded and wicked to accept what he has to offer, and only the person is able to say ‚ÄòIn Spite of it All!‚Äô has the calling for the profession of Politics!‚Äù Weber 2015:198  Three grounds for legitimate rule  Weber defines politics as a form of \\"independent leadership activity\\". In this essay, the \\"state\\" serves as the placeholder for the analysis of political organizations. The grounds for the legitimate rule of these political organizations, according to Weber, fall into three major categories, or types:Weber 2015:137-138 ;Traditional Authority: The authority of \\"eternal past,\\" based on habit. Weber defines custom as largely patriarchal, patrimonial, and traditional in scope. ;Charisma Authority (Gift of Grace): The authority of the \\"revelations, heroism, or other leadership qualities of an individual\\". Associated with \\"charisma\\" of prophets, demagogues, and popular vote. ;Legal Authority: Legal rational authority, legality based on valid statutes which are enforced by technically trained civil servants. Legal authority assumes a rational competence and conditioned obedience of both the civil servants and the people to the legal apparatus.  The two forms of the state  Weber focuses his analysis on \\"political organizations\\", i.e. \\"states\\", and identifies two general forms of the state, supposedly encompassing all state forms at the most general level: # The administrative staff beneath the ruler in status and power has its own means of administration separate from those of the ruler. This can include various forms of wealth and possessions, as well as means of production and control over labor. This administrative staff is essentially aristocratic, subdivided into distinct estates; # The administrative staff is completely or partially separated from the actual tools of administration, similar to Marx's conception of how the proletariat is separated from the means of production. This staff become confidants without means in a patriarchal organization of deference and delegation. Weber delineates two different ideas of the \\"state\\" based on the relationship between the administrators and their access to the actual means of administration. The first form is \\"patrimonialism\\" and dependent on the personality of the ruler, and the loyalty of his followers. There is no emphasis on technical capacity as there is in the second form of the state, which is considered to be modern. In the modern form, the administrators do not personally own the money, buildings, and organizations they direct, Executive decisions often remain with political figures, even though they do not have the technical ability that the modern professional administrators do.

Marriage, World War II, and career Celebrezze began working for the Ohio Unemployment Commission in Columbus, Ohio. In 1938, he passed the bar and returned to Cleveland, where he entered the general practice of law. That same year, he married Anne M.

Upon his discharge at the end of the war, he returned to private practice. Political career In 1950, Celebrezze ran for a seat in the Ohio State Senate, vacated by Howard Metzenbaum, and won. He served as an Ohio state senator from 1951 to 1953. One of the few Democrats to serve in the Senate at the time, Celebrezze cultivated a friendly relationship with the Republican majority. Governor Frank J. Lausche, a Democrat and former Mayor of Cleveland, did not have a good relationship with the Democratic leadership in the Senate. Lausche thus relied heavily on Celebrezze to represent his interests in the Senate. In 1952, when Celebrezze sought re- election to the state senate, he ran into trouble when he crossed the Democratic party chairman, Raymond T. Miller, by supporting fellow Italian American Michael DiSalle for the United States Senate instead of James M. Carney. Celebrezze was renominated by his party and won the general election. Six years later in his gubernatorial campaign, he ran against DiSalle. Mayor of Cleveland In 1952, after continuing battles with the Democratic leadership in the Senate, Celebrezze resigned to run for Mayor of Cleveland. The office was open because sitting Mayor Thomas A. Burke had decided not to seek another term. The Democratic party organization chose Albert S. Porter, Engineer of Cuyahoga County, to succeed Burke. Although lacking support from Party Chairman Miller, Celebrezze had the backing of Governor Lausche. Mayor Burke did not favor either candidate. In the open primary among Porter, Celebrezze, and Republican juvenile court Judge William J. McDermott, Celebrezze won a decisive victory, having a substantial lead over McDermott. Porter came in third. In the general election, Celebrezze again defeated Republican McDermott. He was endorsed by the Cleveland Press editor Louis B. Seltzer. After that, Celebrezze was elected for an unprecedented five two-year terms as mayor, serving from 1953 to 1962. At the time, Cleveland was the fifth-largest city in the nation. Celebrezze drove efforts to build or upgrade the city's infrastructure, and conducted a massive $140 million urban-renewal program. Major portions of the rapid-transit system were constructed during this time, most notably the Red Line, which connected much of the city to the existing Blue and Green lines. There was also extensive work done on the city's freeway system, the Port of Cleveland, and Burke Lakefront Airport. In 1958 Celebrezze was elected president of the American Municipal Association (now the National League of Cities) in 1958. That same year, he sought the Democratic nomination for Governor of Ohio, but lost to Michael DiSalle. In 1960, he launched the Erieview urban renewal plan, designed by architect I. M. Pei. The most prominent result of the plan was the Erieview Tower. He also spurred several building projects, most notably a federal office building (which was later named after him after his death), and the Garden Valley housing project. In 1961, after years of denying rumors that he sought a higher public office, Celebrezze was offered a federal judgeship by President John F. Kennedy, which was a lifetime appointment to a federal judgeship. Celebrezze turned it down to run for a record-breaking fifth consecutive term as mayor, which he won by an unprecedented 73.8 percent, sweeping every one of the city's thirty-three wards. Kennedy appointed him also to serve on the Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity and the Commission on the Status of Women. In 1962, Celebrezze was selected as the president of the United States Conference of Mayors. Cabinet Secretary Celebrezze and John F. Kennedy In 1962, President Kennedy returned to Celebrezze with an offer of a cabinet appointment as United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (now the Department of Health and Human Services). Celebrezze resigned as mayor in 1962 before his appointment on July 31, 1962. He continued his service under President Lyndon Johnson following Kennedy's assassination in November 1963. During this time, Celebrezze contributed to the enactment of landmark social legislation, most notably the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Social Security Act of 1965. One of Celebrezze's most important achievements as secretary of HEW was separating the public assistance and child health and welfare functions from the Social Security Administration, and transferring these programs to a new Welfare Administration. Celebrezze shaped HEW to fit Johnson's initiatives, including getting power from Congress to deny funds for any federal HEW program to any state or institution that practiced racial segregation. Celebrezze found it difficult to maintain two households on his $25,000 salary and apart from his family, and asked Johnson to return to Cleveland. \\"We are going to lose the house in Cleveland if I continue to live here, Mr. President,\\" Celebrezze told Johnson. The President replied that Celebrezze was too honest for Washington because he was the first cabinet secretary \\"to go broke while working for the White House.\\" Celebrezze resigned as HEW Secretary on August 17, 1965. Federal judicial service Celebrezze was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson on July 27, 1965, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which had been vacated by Judge Lester Lefevre Cecil. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 19, 1965, and received his commission on August 19, 1965. After more than fifteen years of service, Celebrezze assumed senior status on October 1, 1980. His service terminated on October 29, 1998, due to his death. Notable cases Celebrezze authored numerous opinions, including Beasley v. United States, which established a fair and progressive standard of \\"effective assistance of counsel\\" under the sixth amendment, Hill v. Tennessee Valley Authority, Gabriele v. Chrysler Corp., and Krause v. Rhodes. Death In the last three years of his life, Celebrezze was mostly inactive on the court, and spent most of his time organizing his personal papers. In the summer of 1998, he became easily fatigued, and advanced throat cancer was diagnosed about September. He was hospitalized briefly at Lakewood Hospital and at the Cleveland Clinic before transferring to the Corinthian Skilled Nursing Center in Cleveland about October 22, 1998. He died there on October 29, 1998. His funeral was held at the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Cleveland, and he was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Brook Park, Ohio. Celebrezze political family Celebrezze and his wife Anne had three children: Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr., Jean Ann (Celebrezze) Porto, and Susan Marie (Celebrezze) Sullivan. Anthony Jr. became an attorney and served as Ohio Attorney General; he also ran for governor. The pair are the only father and son to both run as candidates for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Ohio. His grandson Anthony J. Celebrezze III (son of Anthony Jr.), also became an attorney. Celebrezze's older brother Frank D. Celebrezze I (b. 1899) also became an attorney and was active in civic service. He served as Cleveland Safety Director and later was appointed as a Cleveland Municipal Court judge. His descendants also became attorneys and active politically. Frank Celebrezze became Ohio Chief Justice, and James Celebrezze became an Ohio Supreme Court Judge. Frank D. Celebrezze Jr. (grandson to the first Frank) became an Ohio Appeals Court Judge, and Leslie Ann Celebrezze became Domestic Relations Judge of Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. Legacy Anthony J. Celebrezze fireboat on the Cuyahoga River *In 1964, Celebrezze received the Alumni Medal from his alma mater, John Carroll University. In 1978, JCU conferred him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. He also had honorary degrees from Fenn College, Boston College, LaSalle College, Ohio Northern University, Rhode Island College, Bowling Green State University, Wilberforce University, Miami University (Ohio) and Cleveland State University. *The federal building in Cleveland is named after Celebrezze, as well as an archives room at Ohio Northern University law school (Ada, Ohio).

Modified versions of the Soviet legal system operated in many Communist states following the Second World War‚Äîincluding Mongolia, the People's Republic of China, the Warsaw Pact countries of eastern Europe, Cuba and Vietnam. Soviet concept of law Soviet law was rooted in pre-revolutionary Russian law and Marxism-Leninism. Pre-revolutionary influences included Byzantine law, Mongol law, Russian Orthodox Canon law, and Western law. Western law was mostly absent until the judicial reform of Alexander II in 1864, five decades before the revolution. Despite this, the supremacy of law and equality before the law were not well- known concepts, the tsar was still not bound by the law, and the \\"police had unlimited authority.\\" Marxism-Leninism viewed law as a superstructure in the base and superstructure model of society. \\"Capitalist\\" law was a tool of \\"bourgeois domination and a reflection of bourgeois values.\\" Since law was a tool \\"to maintain class domination\\", in a classless society, law would inevitably disappear. Like all other government institutions, the judiciary was officially subordinated to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. In 1917, the Soviet authorities formally repealed all Tsarist legislation and established a socialist legal system. According to a critic, Richard Pipes, this system abolished Western legal concepts including the rule of law, the civil liberties, the protection of law and guarantees of property.For Pipes, the Soviet legal system regarded law as an arm of politics and courts as agencies of the government. Crime was determined not as the infraction of law, but as any action which could threaten the Soviet state. Extensive extra- judiciary powers were given to the Soviet secret police agencies.The purpose of public trials was \\"not to demonstrate the existence or absence of a crime‚Äîthat was predetermined by the appropriate party authorities‚Äîbut to provide yet another forum for political agitation and propaganda for the instruction of the citizenry. Defense lawyers, who had to be party members, were required to take their client's guilt for granted ...\\" Richard Pipes (2001) Communism Weidenfeld & Nicolson. Richard Pipes (1994) Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime. Vintage. ., pages 401‚Äì403. For example, profiteering could be interpreted as a counter-revolutionary activity punishable by death.

Constitutional law * 1918 Soviet Russian Constitution * 1924 Soviet Constitution * 1936 Soviet Constitution * 1977 Soviet Constitution Court structure Soviet criminal and civil cases involve trials that were \\"primarily[...]official investigation[s] of the truth of the claims and defenses presented\\". Soviet law is very similar in this respect to civil law of European countries like France and Germany. Criminal cases Criminal cases consisted of a preliminary examination before the indictment and the actual trial. In the preliminary examination, the sledovatel (or \\"investigator\\") \\"interrogate[d] the accused and the witnesses and examine[d] evidence\\". The accused was informed of his/her rights before the examination. Before 1958, counsel was only available during the trial. After 1958, counsel was available at the last stage of the preliminary examination after the accused was indicted. The examiner was prohibited from using force though the accused could be confined for long durations: up to 10 days before being charged, up to 9 months during the preliminary investigation (with the approval of the Procurator General) The testimony to be used in the trial was presented to the accused. The sledovatel was subordinate to the procurator (prokuratura) that was tasked with the prosecution, \\"'general supervision' of legality\\", and reporting illegal administrative actions. The indictment that included the preliminary examination was considered the \\"official record\\" at trial. The trial court consisted of a professional judge with a 5-year term and two assessors (lay judges) from the population with a 2.5-year term. The proceedings were informal compared to United States standards. The judges first questioned accused and witnesses, then the procurator and defense counsel to corroborate the evidence in the indictment. The accused and the victim could question each other or the witnesses. The accused was presumed innocent, though not in the common law sense. The court decided by majority vote. The accused or the procurator could appeal decisions to a higher court consisting of three professional judges that reviewed the facts and the law. If the procurator appealed, the higher court could set aside the judgment and remand the case. Although the decision of the appeals court was \\"final\\", higher courts could review them as \\"supervision\\". Here, the accused or his/her counsel could submit briefs, but they could not appear in person. During the trial, the judges had the additional responsibility of educating the people for example revealing and removing the causes and conditions that led to the crime. Judges kept legal technicalities to a minimum; the court's stated purpose was to find the truth, rather than to protect legal rights. Although most hearings were open to the public, hearings could also be held privately, if the Soviet Government deemed it necessary. Civil court Soviet civil court process did not entail a high degree of physical interference. There was no sudden arrest or detention during a preliminary investigation phase. The trial was conducted entirely by a counsel and, if need be, a stay was obtained. Human rights In Soviet law, rights were granted by the state and thus were subordinate to the state. Rights were commitments by the state to enact laws that would secure benefits for the citizens. However, if the state failed to do so, citizens had no legal remedy. Soviet law emphasized economic and social rights over civil and political rights. The 1977 Constitution enshrined the rights work, health, education and extended freedoms of speech, the press, assembly, and others.

It features an ensemble cast with Clive Owen as the title character, Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot and Keira Knightley as Guinevere, along with Mads Mikkelsen, Joel Edgerton, Hugh Dancy, Ray Winstone, Ray Stevenson, Stephen Dillane, Stellan Skarsg√•rd and Til Schweiger. The film is unusual in reinterpreting Arthur as a Roman officer rather than a medieval knight. Despite these departures from the source material, the Welsh Mabinogion, the producers of the film attempted to market it as a more historically accurate version of the Arthurian legends, supposedly inspired by new archaeological findings. The film also replaces the sword in the stone story with a more dark and tragic backstory of how Arthur claimed his sword Excalibur. The film was shot in Ireland, England, and Wales. Plot In the 5th century AD, the declining Roman Empire is withdrawing from Britannia, where the native Woads, led by Merlin, stage an insurgency. A group of Sarmatian knights and their half-British Roman commander Artorius Castus, known as \\"Arthur\\", have fulfilled their duties to Rome and are preparing to return home until Bishop Germanus orders them to complete one final mission: evacuate an important Italian family from north of Hadrian's Wall, saving them from an advancing army of invading Saxons, led by the ruthless Cerdic and his son, Cynric. Alecto, the son of the family patriarch, is a viable candidate to be a future Pope. Arthur and his remaining men - Lancelot, Tristan, Galahad, Bors, Gawain, and Dagonet - reluctantly accept the mission. Arriving at their destination, they find that the Roman patriarch Marius, who refuses to leave, has enslaved the local population, enraging Arthur. He discovers a cell complex containing a number of dead Woads and two tortured survivors ‚Äî a young woman named Guinevere and her younger brother Lucan. Arthur frees them and gives Marius an ultimatum ‚Äî leave with them willingly or otherwise be taken prisoner. He and his knights commandeer the homestead, and liberate its exploited people. The convoy flees into the mountains with the Saxons in pursuit. Marius leads an attempted coup but is slain by Guinevere. Arthur learns from Alecto that Germanus and his fellow bishops had Arthur's childhood mentor and father figure, Pelagius, executed for his beliefs. This further disillusions Arthur from the Roman way of life, a process that matures when Guinevere and Merlin remind Arthur of his connection to the island of Britain through his Celtic mother. Arthur leads the pursuing Saxons, led by Cynric, through a pass crossing a frozen lake. As battle ensues, Dagonet sacrifices himself to crack the lake ice with his axe, disrupting the Saxon advance. The knights safely deliver Alecto and his mother to Hadrian's wall and are officially discharged. Arthur, having concluded that his destiny lies with his mother's people, decides to engage the Saxons despite Lancelot's pleas to leave with them. The night before the battle, he and Guinevere make love and on the following day, Arthur meets Cerdic under a white flag of parlay, vowing to kill him. He is soon joined by Lancelot and his fellow knights, who decide to fight. In the climactic Battle of Badon Hill, the Woads and knights whittle the Saxon army. Guinevere engages Cynric, who overwhelms her. Lancelot aids her and kills Cynric but is fatally wounded. Cerdic kills Tristan before facing off against Arthur, who kills the Saxon leader, condemning the invaders to defeat. Arthur and Guinevere marry and Merlin proclaims Arthur as king of Britain. United by their defeat of the Saxons and the retreat of the Romans, Arthur promises to lead the Britons against future invaders. Three horses that had belonged to Tristan, Dagonet and Lancelot run free across the landscape, as the closing narrative from Lancelot describes how fallen knights live on in tales passed from generation to generation. Cast Production The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Antoine Fuqua; David Franzoni, the writer of the original draft script for Gladiator, wrote the screenplay. The historical consultant for the film was John Matthews, an author known for his books on esoteric Celtic spirituality, some of which he co-wrote with his wife Caitlin Matthews. The research consultant was Linda A. Malcor, co-author of From Scythia to Camelot: A Radical Reinterpretation of the Legends of King Arthur, the Knights of the Round Table, and the Holy Grail, in which possible non-Celtic sources for the Arthurian legends are explored. The film's main set, a replica of a section of Hadrian's Wall, was the largest film set ever built in Ireland, and was located in a field in County Kildare. The replica was one kilometre long, which took a crew of 300 building workers four and a half months to build.'Making of' featurette on DVD release of the film The fort in the film was based on the Roman fort named Vindolanda, which was built around 80 AD just south of Hadrian's Wall in what is now called Chesterholm in Northern England. Relationship with Arthurian legend Cinematic versus traditional portrayal Guinevere's warrior persona is closer to the ancient Queen Medb (romanticised above) of the Irish T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge than the Guinevere of Arthurian legend. By J.C. Leyendecker, 1916 The film's storyline is not taken from the traditional sources, but is a work of creative fiction. The only notable exception to this is the inclusion of the Saxons as Arthur's adversaries and the Battle of Badon Hill. Most traditional elements of Arthurian legend are dropped, such as the Holy Grail and Tristan's lover Iseult. The film barely includes the love triangle between Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere; whilst Guinevere and Arthur are romantically involved, only a few sequences depict a possible relationship between Lancelot and Guinevere. The film does not feature Kay and Bedivere. Along with Gawain, they already appear as Arthur's companions in very early Welsh sources, like Culhwch and Olwen in the Mabinogion. The knights' characterisations in Arthurian legend are also dropped. For example, the film's portrayal of a boorish and lusty Bors, the father of many children, differs greatly from his namesake whose purity and celibacy allowed him to witness the Holy Grail according to legend. The cinematic portrayal of Bors is therefore much closer to the traditional depiction of Sir Kay than his legendary namesake. Lancelot and Galahad are portrayed as having similar ages, whereas according to traditional versions they are father and son respectively (the film's approach is also found in modern Arthurian fiction ‚Äî such as Bernard Cornwell's The Warlord Chronicles, in which they are brothers). The cinematic portrayal of Guinevere as a Celtic warrior who joins Arthur's knights in battle is a drastic alteration from the demure \\"damsel in distress\\" of courtly romance.Rowland, Robin (2004). \\"Warrior queens and blind critics.\\" CBC News Although there is historical and mythological precedent for \\"sword-swinging warrior queens\\", such as the British Boudica of the Iceni, Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd of Wales, or the various Celtic war goddesses, the film's portrayal of Guinevere is actually closer to the Queen Medb of the Irish T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge. However, no source, early or late, describes Guinevere as either a warrior or a rustic Celt; in fact, in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, which contains one of the oldest accounts of the character, Guinevere has Roman blood while Arthur is an indigenous Celt. Despite the film's alleged historical angle, Merlin was not originally part of the legends. It is generally agreed that he is based on two figures‚ÄîMyrddin Wyllt (Myrddin the Wild), and Aurelius Ambrosius, a highly fictionalised version of the historical war leader Ambrosius Aurelianus. The former had nothing to do with Arthur and flourished after the Arthurian period. The composite Merlin was created by Geoffrey of Monmouth. Differences between the film and the Arthurian legend In the film, Arthur's father is a Roman general from the Imperial Roman army and his mother is a Celtic woman. In the historical notes of the legend, Arthur's father is Uther Pendragon, a famous Romano-British commander and one of Britain's earlier kings, and his mother is Igraine, a beautiful young woman who was once the wife of Gorlois, the Duke of Cornwall and one of Uther's loyal subjects. Arthur's knights are described differently in the film and the legend. In the film, Lancelot, Tristan, Bors and the other Knights of the Round Table are Sarmatian knights fighting for the glory of the Roman Empire. In historical notes, the Knights of the Round Table are Britons, knights of Romano-Celtic Britain fighting for the freedom of Britain against the Saxons. A round table is briefly present in the movie, where Arthur's knights regularly meet in equality, and which flummoxes the bishop Germanus when he cannot find a place at the table to distinguish his stature. Other references to Arthurian legend Dagonet, a self-sacrificing warrior in the film, has Arthur's court jester as his namesake. The character appears in Le Morte d'Arthur and Idylls of the King. Also in the film, Lancelot fights using two swords. This may be a reference to the ill-fated Sir Balin, the \\"Knight with Two Swords\\", but this epithet refers to his cursed sword rather than his fighting style. Tristan has a pet hawk. In Welsh legends, a figure named Gwalchmai is commonly considered identical with Gawain (both are nephews of Arthur); a popular though unlikely proposed meaning of his name is \\"hawk of May\\".Bromwich, Rachel. Trioedd Ynys Prydein, pp. 367‚Äì371. The role of traitor, typically ascribed to Mordred, is given a smaller part in the form of a young British scout, played by Alan Devine, who betrays his people to the Saxons. The character is unnamed, but called \\"British Scout\\" in the credits. Tristan kills the traitor with an arrow from the other side of Hadrian's Wall during the climactic battle. Relationship with other works Italian historian and novelist Valerio Massimo Manfredi claimed that the movie was almost a plagiarism of his 2002 novel The Last Legion, due to several similarities between the two works. These similarities include the reuse of some tropes and happenings present in the book and, especially, the attempt to give historical reliability to the main characters with the concept of King Arthur having Roman origins. Indeed, the events of the movie suggest a theory that is largely different from the one on which Manfredi's novel is based, in which Artorius Castus isn't even mentioned, and neither is the Sarmatian auxiliary army. According to Manfredi, King Arthur's release and its commercial failure were among the main causes of the problems related to the movie adaptation of his novel, which was in development hell until its release in 2007. Historical notes Despite the film's supposedly historically grounded approach, much artistic licence is taken regarding historical figures, peoples, events, religion, wardrobe, and weaponry. The film places the story of Arthur not in its better-known medieval setting, but in the (still plausible) earlier times of antiquity, the early dawn of the Middle Ages ‚Äì as did the earliest versions of the Arthur story. It would appear that the Arthur depicted in the film is based most closely upon Ambrosius Aurelianus, the Romano-Briton who fought against the Saxons in the 5th century, and was probably the leader of the Romano-British at the Battle of Mons Badonicus (Mount Badon). Nevertheless, Arthur's full name in the film is Artorius Castus, referring to Lucius Artorius Castus, a historical Roman active in Britain in the 2nd or 3rd century.Riederer, Chris. King Arthur - Key historical facts.. Retrieved September 9, 2007. It is specified that Arthur was given the ancestral name of a legendary leader. The film is loosely based on the \\"Sarmatian hypothesis\\", formulated by C. Scott Littleton and Ann C. Thomas in 1978, which holds that the Arthurian legend has a historical nucleus in the Sarmatian heavy cavalry troops stationed in Britain,C.Scott Littleton - A.C. Thomas: \\"The Sarmatian Connection: New Light on the Origin of the Arthurian and Holy Grail Legends.\\" Journal of American Folklore 91, 1978, pp. 512-527 referencing the similarities between the legends of king Arthur and the older legends of Nartian king Batraz. In the 2nd century, 5,500 Iazyges were transported there as auxiliaries during the Marcomannic Wars. However, the hypothesis is not accepted by scholars who say it lacks a solid base.Richard Wadge, \\"A British or Sarmatian Tradition,\\" Folklore, Vol. 98, No. 2 (1987), pp. 204-215. Roman political issues In the film, the Roman legions withdraw from Britain in AD 467; in reality, this was completed in the year 410, nearly 60 years before. Similarly, the opening text dictates that \\"King Arthur and his Knights rose from a real hero who lived [...] in a period often called the Dark Ages\\". The film, however, is set in 467. Some count the Dark Ages as being in Sub-Roman Britain after the last Emperor of the Western Roman Empire, Romulus Augustus, was deposed by Odoacer in 476, nine years after the date for the setting of the film. The current Roman Emperor in the film's time would have been Anthemius. The Roman family which Arthur rescues lives north of Hadrian's Wall. This mission would be unlikely because the Wall represented the extent of Roman rule in Britain, except for brief periods of occupation during the 2nd century AD during which time they got as far north as Falkirk in the Central Lowlands of Scotland, where pieces of the Antonine Wall are still visible; particularly in Callendar Park. Romanized client states such as that of the Votadini did exist north of the wall even into the Sub-Roman era. At times there were Roman forts in Cawdor as far north as Inverness. Britons and Saxons The Picts are called \\"Woads\\".Cathy Schultz, \\"KING ARTHUR: Romans and Saxons and Picts, oh my! ,\\" History in the Movies This word is a reference to one plant the Picts may have used to make blue paint; however, the use of woad by the Picts is contested by scholars, and the historical Picts were never known by this name.Lambert, Kym (2004) The Problem of the Woad. Retrieved 1-27-07. In an interview Antoine Fuqua stated that they used \\"Wodes\\" (sic) instead of \\"Picts\\" because they thought the latter sounded \\"a little weird\\".Gilchrist, Todd \\"Interview: Antoine Fuqua, Keira Knightley and Clive Owen revisit the round table with King Arthur\\". \\"It was a little weird in the dialogue when we did a reading, to hear people say 'picts'. It came off kind of odd, for some reason, when they spoke it. So we went with Wodes.\\" Retrieved December 18, 2006. Nevertheless, John Matthews said in an online article that the name substitution was \\"meant to echo similar belittling titles given to enemies\\". The 9th century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle mentions the arrival of the Saxon leaders Cerdic and Cynric in Britain (in Hampshire) in 495.Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, A.D. 458 - A.D. 500 According to the Chronicle Cynric succeeded Cerdic as king of Wessex in 534 (Cerdic was the founder of the kingdom).Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, A.D. 501 - A.D. 560 Thus the two could not have died at the battle of Mount Badon. The battle is thought to have been fought sometime between 490 and 516.O'Sullivan, Thomas D., The De Excidio of Gildas, 1978. These dates are not universally accepted, as some scholars argue for a date in the mid 5th century. Cf. Lapidge, Michael, \\"Gildas's Education and the Latin Culture of Sub-Roman Britain\\" in Gildas: New Approaches, 1984. The Saxons are shown attacking Hadrian's Wall from the north. By 467 the Saxons were already occupying parts of Britain far south of the wall.Gildas, De Excido Britanniae Later in the film, Cerdic stops a warrior from raping a woman because it would lead to less-than-pure Saxon blood. This scene references the long-held belief that the Anglo-Saxons eradicated the Romano-Britons from the eastern part of the island. This contention, largely based on linguistic evidence, has been challenged by modern genetic analysis, which suggests extensive mixing between Anglo-Saxon and Briton populations. Some historians (and fiction writersCf. Alfred Duggan, Conscience of the King; Stephen Lawhead, Pendragon Cycle series; David Drake, The Dragon Lord) have even suggested that Cerdic himself was at least part Briton. His name \\"Cerdic\\" has been argued to be a Germanised form of a Celtic name such as Ceretic or Caradoc. Military technology Historically, Sarmatians were armoured in the manner of cataphracts (full-length coats of scale armour); the film's Sarmatians are armoured with a mishmash of pseudo- Roman, Turkish, Mongol and Hunnic designs. The Saxons historically used bows (to a limited extent) and spears instead of crossbows during the period. Though there is evidence for the use of some form of crossbows by Romans (calling them manuballistae) and, some claim, the Picts, the weapon was still not widely used in England until much later. Similarly, the Woads use a trebuchet-like weapon to hurl flaming missiles at the Saxons, though the trebuchet was not re-introduced to Britain until the Siege of Dover in 1216. The Romans, however, reportedly used an early form of the trebuchet in their sieges. Roman soldiers displayed in the film are depicted as legionaries with 2nd century armour. By AD 400, legionaries were no longer in use and comitatenses were the new replacements. Religious inaccuracies The real Pelagius was a monk, not a bishop. He engaged Saint Augustine of Hippo in a debate on the theological issue of the relationship between grace and free will. However, the film confuses the issue of political freedoms and social choices (which were not issues in political debate in the 5th/6th centuries) with the principle of free will in relationship to God. When Arthur informs the people that \\"You ...were free from your first breath!\\", Roger Ebert notes that he is both \\"anticipating by a millennium or so the notion that all men are born free, and overlooking the detail that his knights have been pressed into involuntary servitude.\\"Ebert, Roger. \\"King Arthur\\", July 7, 2004, RogerEbert.com The Pelagian heresy denied original sin with its doctrine of the bondage of the will and the need for healing by God's grace. Nor was Pelagius executed for heresy in Rome as the film indicates. He is believed to have died decades before 467 AD, likely of old age.\\"Pelagius and Pelagianism\\", Catholic Encyclopedia St. Germanus of Auxerre's second (and last) mission to Britain was twenty years before (447 AD) and he died the following year.\\"St. Germain\\", Catholic Encyclopedia Germanus is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church and Anglican Communion and, although portrayed in the film as a cruel and pompous aristocrat, historically he \\"extended his hospitality to all sorts of persons, washed the feet of the poor and served them with his own hands, while he himself fasted.\\"Thurston, Herbert, S.J. Butler's Lives of the Saints, c1956, p251-252 The film implies that the Pope (who in 467 was Pope Hilarius) was in control of the Western Roman Empire, although it was actually ruled by the Emperor and de facto controlled by the Magistri Militum and other regional governors. The Pope would not gain the political power to grant lands and other comparable privileges until centuries after the setting of the film. The film seems to be implying a literal interpretation of the Donation of Constantine, a document purportedly written in the 4th century, but in actuality an 8th-century forgery. Promotion Elements of the film's promotion have likewise been criticized as historically unsound. Its tagline \\"The True Story Behind the Legend\\" has been criticised as false.Schultz, Cathy (2004). \\"KING ARTHUR: Romans and Saxons and Picts, oh my! ,\\" History in the MoviesYoungs, Ian (2004). \\"King Arthur film history defended.\\" BBC News Online. A trailer for the film claims that historians now agree that Arthur was a real person because of alleged \\"recent\\" archaeological findings, yet there is no consensus amongst historians on Arthur's historicityN. J. Higham, King Arthur, Myth- Making and History (London: Routledge, 2002), pp.11-37 has a good summary of the debate on Arthur's existence. and no recent archaeological find proves Arthur's existence; the so-called \\"Arthur stone\\", discovered in 1998 in securely dated 6th century contexts amongst the ruins at Tintagel Castle in Cornwall, created a stir but has subsequently been of little use as evidence.\\"Early Medieval Tintagel: An Interview with Archaeologists Rachel Harry and Kevin Brady\\" , The Heroic Age, 1999Green, Thomas. (1998 [2008]) Notes to \\"The Historicity and Historicisation of Arthur.\\" www.arthuriana.co.uk Reception Box office King Arthur grossed $51.9 million in the United States and Canada and $151.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $203.6 million, against a production budget of $120 million. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 31% based on 190 reviews being positive with the critics consensus being \\"The magic is gone, leaving a dreary, generic action movie\\". On Metacritic the film has a score of 46 out of 100 based on reviews from 41 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". David Edelstein of Slate called the film \\"profoundly stupid and inept\\" and added, \\"it's an endless source of giggles once you realise that its historical revisionism has nothing to do with archeological discoveries and everything to do with the fact that no one at Disney would green-light an old-fashioned talky love triangle with a hero who dies and an adulterous heroine who ends up in a nunnery.\\" A. O. Scott of the New York Times further remarked that the film was \\"a blunt, glowering B picture, shot in murky fog and battlefield smoke, full of silly-sounding pomposity and swollen music (courtesy of the prolifically bombastic Hans Zimmer). The combat scenes, though boisterous and brutal, are no more coherent than the story, which requires almost as much exposition as the last Star Wars film. Luckily there is an element of broad, brawny camp that prevents King Arthur from being a complete drag.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times had a more positive response to the film and awarded it three out of four stars, writing, \\"That the movie works is because of the considerable production qualities and the charisma of the actors, who bring more interest to the characters than they deserve. There is a kind of direct, unadorned conviction to the acting of Clive Owen and the others; raised on Shakespeare, trained for swordfights, with an idea of Arthurian legend in their heads since childhood, they don't seem out of time and place like the cast of Troy. They get on with it.\\" Robin Rowland criticised critics who disliked the film for its Dark Age setting. Rowland pointed out that several Arthurian novels are set in the Dark Ages, like Rosemary Sutcliff's Sword at Sunset and Mary Stewart's Merlin trilogy (The Crystal Cave, The Hollow Hills and The Last Enchantment). However, these works have little in common with the film's story and Sarmatian angle. In response to criticism of the setting, consultant on the film Linda A. Malcor said: \\"I think these film-makers did a better job than most could have done when it comes to giving us something besides knights in tin foil and damsels in chiffon.... [they] deserve a lot of praise for the effort that they made.\\" Fellow Arthurian scholar Geoffrey Ashe's opinion was negative. Director's cut An unrated director's cut of the film was released; it has extra footage of battle scenes as well as more scenes between Lancelot and Guinevere, whose traditional love triangle with Arthur is only hinted at here. The battle scenes are also bloodier and more graphic. Several scenes are also omitted from the director's cut, including one where the knights sit around a camp fire asking about their intended Sarmatian life, in which Bors reveals that his children do not even have names, most simply have numbers. In addition, a sex scene between Guinevere and Arthur is shifted to be chronologically before he is informed of the incoming Saxons towards Hadrian's Wall. This seemingly minor change arguably helps the story flow more smoothly. In the original film he is seen in full battle armour, contemplating a broken image of Pelagius on his floor, and then is disturbed by a call to come outside. When he comes outside, he is hastily putting on a shirt, and his hair is disheveled. In the Director's Cut, after an intimate moment between Arthur and Guinevere explaining Arthur's morals, they carry on into their sexual encounter, and are thus disturbed so that Arthur can be briefed on the Saxons. During the sexual encounter, he is wearing the same outfit he wears during the briefing. The scene where he is examining Pelagius's image is removed. Marketing Despite these many drastic diversions from the source material (including the Welsh Mabinogion), the producers of the film attempted to market it as a more historically accurate version of the Arthurian legends. Other liberties were taken with the actors' appearances: Keira Knightley's breasts were enlarged for the US theatrical film poster. This practice angered Knightley, who says that it \\"comes from market research that clearly shows that other women refuse to look at famous actresses and stars with small breasts.\\" Later in 2006, Knightley claimed she is \\"not allowed to be on a magazine cover in the US without at least a C cup because it 'turns people off'.\\" Video game See also * List of films based on Arthurian legend * List of historical drama films References External links  2000s historical films 2000s war films 2004 films 2000s action drama films American films American historical films American war drama films Arthurian films British action drama films British films British historical films British war drama films English-language films Fiction narrated by a dead person Fiction set in Roman Britain Films set in the Roman Empire Films set in the 5th century Fictional-language films Films set in classical antiquity Scottish Gaelic-language films Films produced by Jerry Bruckheimer Latin-language films Touchstone Pictures films Films shot at Pinewood Studios Films directed by Antoine Fuqua Films scored by Hans Zimmer Picts in fiction 2004 drama films ","title":"King Arthur (2004 film)"},{"id":"709512","text":"The Canadian Federation of Students (CFS) is the largest student organization in Canada, representing over 530,000 students from across Canada. Formed in 1981, the stated goal of the Federation is to represent the collective voice of Canadian students and work at the federal level for high quality, accessible post-secondary education. The CFS has its roots in Canada's long tradition of having national student organizations, such as formerly the National Union of Students (Canada), the Canadian Union of Students, the National Federation of Canadian University Students, the Canadian Student Assembly, and the Student Christian Movement of Canada (SCM). CFS is composed of member local student unions. All members of the Canadian Federation of Students pay membership dues as a part of their membership. In Canadian student politics, the decision of whether a student union should be a member of the Federation is a contentious issue, and the organization's processes for joining or leaving its membership has been the subject of much debate. Structure The name \\"Canadian Federation of Students\\" is generally used to designate three legally distinct organizations: the national CFS, one of the provincial components of the Federation, and/or CFS-Services. CFS and CFS- Services share the same bylaws and decision-making structures. These structures include biannual general meetings, where every member students' union receives one vote regardless of the size of their local membership, and an executive, which includes representatives of each provincial affiliate. In provinces where a significant number of students' unions are members of the CFS, the affiliated component (e.g. CFS-Ontario, CFS-NS) has its own general meetings and executive, the latter being formed by representatives of the local students' unions. In October 2009 CFS-Quebec ceased to operate as a recognized provincial affiliate of the CFS. History The CFS was officially formed on October 18, 1981, from the merger of two national organizations - the National Union of Students in Canada and the Association of Student Councils - and student federations from five Canadian provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Saskatchewan).Canadian Federation of Students, National general meeting minutes, October 1981. The goal of the merger was to create a united student movement in Canada that could provide student-oriented services and political representation at the federal and provincial levels of government. Part of the impetus to organize came from the federal government's announcement of $2 billion of cuts from Established Program Financing (including cuts to federal transfer payments for health and education). Another impetus was raising tuition fees, which had been a major issue for CFS' precursor organization. the NUS, starting in the late 1970s. Founding conference The founding conference was held at Carleton University between October 14‚Äì19, 1981. Mike McNeil was elected as the organization's first Chairperson, along with Mike Walker (Treasurer), former NUS treasurer Kirk Falconer (International Affairs Commissioner), Kathie Cram (Women's Commissioner), Brian Robinson (Graduate Student Representative), Ben Freedman (Member at Large), and Leslie Neilson (Member at Large).Nancy Boyle, \\"CFS: Working together for change\\" The Charlatan, October 22, 1981. The Federation's bylaws and constitution were finalized and over 50 motions were passed during the plenary. After hearing speeches by Salvadoran and Chilean students, delegates passed motions condemning human rights violations and anti-student policies in those countries.Ben Schaub \\"International policy workshop focuses on human rights\\", The Charlatan, October 22, 1981 A campaign strategy was also launched to oppose the federal government's planned cut to Established Program Financing (EPF). The slogan for the campaign was \\"Access not axe us\\" and it called for an establishment of an all-grant system and a public inquiry into the future of post-secondary education. The campaign also called for alliance building with community groups and public sector workers to gain support and fight against cutbacks to social programs. The campaign was named after a research report of the same name, by Bruce Tate. The report focused on effects of the Government of Canada's cutback to education and highlighted issues such as access and tuition fee levels.Bob Cox, \\"Access not axe us\\" The Charlatan, October 22, 1981 The conference ended with a student presence in Question Period in the House of Commons of Canada, a meeting with Secretary of State Gerald Regan, and a one-on-one debate between Chairperson Mike McNeil and Member of Parliament John Evans (parliamentary secretary to Finance Minister Allan MacEachen) in the Snake Lounge at Carleton University.Susan Sherring, \\"Evans spars with hostile crowd of students\\", The Charlatan, October 22, 1981 Delegates attending Question Period were denied entry by security guards.Susan Sherring, \\"Students not welcome to sit in House of Commons\\" The Charlatan, October 22, 1981 Mike McNeil and delegates were not satisfied with the outcome of the meeting with Gerald Regan. Evolution of membership =1992-1995= In 1992, the CFS resolved that it would be a \\"partner in the International Student Trade, Environment and Development Program.\\" Member locals were urged \\"to consider hosting international guests from the US.A and Mexico during the fall of 1992 to contribute to the national dialogue of the effects on the education system of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\\" (CFS Minutes, May 24-3th Centre Universitaire Saint-Louis Maillet, Edmundston, New Brunswick). The CFS reached a membership of 440,000 students from 65 member students' unions in 1993-1994. Overall, 20 membership votes were held in 1994-1995, with the net result that 59 member students' unions formed the CFS in September 1996. =1995-2007= Between 1995 and 2007, over twenty students' unions joined the CFS, including many graduate students' associations and part-time students' associations. Several large undergraduate students' associations voted to join CFS during the same period. In 2002, the University of Toronto Students' Administrative Council, which had never been part of a national students' union before, voted to join the CFS. At the November 2005 Annual General Meeting of the Federation, the positive result of the votes at both University of Manitoba Students' Union and the University of Saskatchewan Students' Union were ratified. The latter vote result was challenged by former USSU director, and in 2007, the courts ruled the vote to be of no force or effect. The CFS website continues to list the USSU as Local 17. In October 2007, USSU voted to keep prospective membership in the CFS and hold a referendum in the next two years; however, in September 2009 the USSU voted to rescind that motion and claims that its affiliation with CFS is void. =2008= In March 2008, students at four campuses (Cape Breton University, Simon Fraser University, Kwantlen University-College, and Graduate students at University of Victoria) held votes to leave the CFS. The negative media coverage of the CFS was one of the reasons listed by the Kwantlen Student Association representatives for calling the votes. Members at CBU, the SFU and the UVic (graduate students) voted to leave. CFS representatives did not participate in the Cape Breton referendum, noting that the CBUSU failed to give proper notice. Fellow CFS members from other campuses participated in the Simon Fraser vote to leave CFS, but then national chairperson Amanda Aziz stated that problems with the voting process could result in the outcome not being recognized by the CFS. The UVGSS result was not contested by the CFS. The Canadian Federation of Students petitioned the BC Supreme Court to postpone the Kwantlen referendum after Kwantlen Students Association representatives hired Schiffner Consultants to run the vote (contrary to CFS bylaws but in accordance with KSA standard operating procedures). Then-KSA chairperson Laura Anderson claimed that the Federation was attempting to stall the vote, but the court granted the CFS the injunction and the vote to leave CFS was rescheduled for April 2008. Three weeks after the referenda at SFU and UVic (graduate students), Kwantlen students voted to remain members of the CFS. In the fall of 2008, the largest bilingual student association in Canada, the Student Federation of the University of Ottawa, re- joined the CFS. However, in December 2018 the SFUO will no longer be recognized as a student union by the Universities governing bodies, following a termination of their agreement.https://media.uottawa.ca/news/university- ottawa-terminates-agreement-sfuo#QA =2009= In October 2009 students at Carleton, Guelph, and Concordia organized a drive to leave CFS, resulting in petitions meeting the threshold necessary to initiate decertification votes. Students at the University of Victoria Students' Society, and the Graduate Student Association at the University of Calgary collected enough signatures to initiate a decertification vote. =2010= In the spring of 2010, undergraduate students at the University of Guelph and the Alberta College of Art and Design and graduate students at the University of Calgary and McGill University attempted to hold decertification votes. Only the Alberta College of Art and Design vote followed the applicable CFS bylaws. Several irregularities in the conduct of the students' unions at McGill and Calgary were cited by the CFS as reasons for invalidating the decertification votes. =2011= In March 2011, undergraduate students at the University of Victoria voted to leave the CFS. =2012= In January 2012, students of Laurentian University at Georgian College in Barrie joined the CFS as the Laurentian Students' Union (Local 111). In a February 7, 2012 article that appeared in The Concordian, it was reported that the CFS was alleging that the Concordia Students' Union owed $1.8 million in unpaid membership dues going back as far as the 1990s. Lex Gill, then-president of the CSU firmly denied the CFS' claim. =2018= In June 2018, after a lengthy conflict between the CFS and the British Columbia Federation of Students (BCFS) over unpaid membership dues, the CFS voted to expel all member unions belonging to the CFS and the BCFS. Current campaigns Fight the Fees The CFS actively lobbies on tuition-related issues, including meeting with MPs and organizing \\"days of action\\" to address such issues as eliminating tuition fees and reductions in interest rates on student loans. In Newfoundland and Labrador, the only province where all public college and university students' are members of the CFS, students pay the lowest average undergraduate tuition fees in Canada. There, tuition fees were reduced by 25% in the 1990s and have remained frozen. The current Progressive Conservative government has pledged to keep the freeze in place until the end of their mandate, and recently eliminated the interest on the provincial portion of student loans. In 2015 the provincial government in Alberta froze tuition fees. In British Columbia, the CFS successfully lobbied the former New Democratic Party (NDP) government to introduce tuition fee freezes and reductions.  Fairness for International Students  In 2017, the CFS launched a campaign in support of international students. On average, international students pay $25,589.00 per year for a general arts degree in Canada; an amount close to four times more than domestic students. In March 2018 the CFS held a lobby week for international students, where students met with MPs and senators to lobby on the three pillars of the campaign: eliminating all differential tuition fees, providing universal public healthcare, and ensuring clear pathways to permanent residency. Indigenous student issues The Circle of First Nations, Metis and Inuit Students \\"Circle\\" is the mechanism with the CFS by which Indigenous students can organize campaigns. The Caucus has its own budget and runs campaigns such as Where's the Justice, Not Your Stereotype, No More Stolen Sisters, and ReconciliAction. One of ReconciliAction's, the Circle's most recent campaign, main goal's is to fulfill the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 16th recommendation by increasing support for indigenous language education at post-secondary institutions. After extensive lobby by CFS members on increased funding for the Post-Secondary Student Support Program, the federal government announced in 2017 an increase of $90 million to the program for indigenous learners. Coty Downey Zacheriah after serving as the Chair of circle for two years, became the first Indigenous National Chairperson of the Canadian Federation of students, and is currently serving his second term. Prior to 2017 the caucus was named \\"NAC\\" National Aboriginal Caucus.  Sexualized and Gender Based Violence  One of the CFS's longest-standing campaigns is the 'No Means No' campaign, now called 'Consent is Mandatory.' The CFS works closely with on-campus sexual assault centres to challenge rape culture, educate students about sexual consent and combat gender-based violence. In 2018 the federal government announced a National framework to address gender based violence in post-secondary education sector. In 2016, governments in Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia passed legislation requiring post-secondary institutions to have stand-alone sexual assault and harassment policies.  Mental Health  The CFS campaigns for increased support for on-campus mental health services and overall access to medication and counselling. The campaign saw early success. In 2017 colleges and universities received an additional $6 million of federal funding annually (promised for three years) to provide mental health services and supports for students, bringing the total amount of mental health funding to $15 million a year. In 2018, the Ontario government announced a $2.1 billion investment in mental health services.  End the Ban  In 1998, the CFS launched a campaign to change Canadian Blood Services' policy of prohibiting any man who has had sex with a man from donating blood. The campaign garnered significant media attention. In May 2013, Canadian Blood Services changed their lifetime ban to a five year deferral if, during those five years, men do not have sex with men. In the spring of 2016, Canadian Blood Services changed the deferral to one year.  United for Equity  The United for Equity campaign \\"aims to challenge all forms of discrimination and oppression on our campuses, in our communities, and in our student organizing spaces.\\" The CFS produces a number of materials on challenging racism, sexism, abelism, homophobia, transphobia, islamaphobia and anti-semitism. The organization also helps student unions educate their members about these issues through workshops and awareness-raising. In 2006, the CFS completed a Taskforce on the Needs of Muslim Students. Graduate student issues The Canadian Federation of Students is the only student organization in Canada with a distinct graduate caucus that elects its own executive and operates with its own budget. Known as the National Graduate Caucus (NGC), it consists of 90,000 graduate students at 29 campuses across Canada.National Graduate Caucus, Canadian Federation of Students. Accessed July 27, 2008:<> =Commercialization of research= The NGC campaigns to oppose commercialization of university research because its research shows that pressures from industry partners can threaten academic freedom and the public interest.CFS - National Graduate Caucus It points to cases such as those of Nancy Olivieri and David Healy as examples of commercialization run amok.Alex Kazia, Naushad Ali Husein, Jade Colbert, \\"Welcome to your corporate campus\\" The Varsity, Accessed July 27, 2008. =Whistleblowers campaign= In 2006 the NGC began working with Christopher Radziminski, alumnus from the University of Toronto, to support his battle with the University of Toronto and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) over research conducted with ERCO Worldwide. The former student alleges that a drinking water experiment in Wiarton, Ontario was not accurately reported in scholarly journals, posing a serious health risk to Canadians.Feds draw on study of controversial chemical for new drinking water guidelines The NGC is supporting a judicial review of NSERC's decision not to press for an investigation at the University of Toronto.CFS - Media =Post-residency fees= The NGC has an active campaign to reduce fees charged to graduate students after their residency period. Graduate student unions affiliated to the NGC urge graduate students to sign pledges that they will not make alumni donations until their university reduces post-residency fees. =Copyright renewal= The NGC has been lobbying the federal government in partnership with several organizations over current reform of the Canadian Copyright Act. This involves a letter writing campaign to MPs and participation in developing the Creative Commons project. =Research funding= The NGC advocates for increased graduate student funding in the form of scholarships and training programmes. In the 2016 federal budget, the Government of Canada allocated an additional $95 million towards public research through the Tri-Council granting agencies. =BDS= Although BDS is controversial, the union officially endorsed the campaign in November 2018. Services The Canadian Federation of Students-Services (CFS-Services) is a legally separate branch of the Federation, founded in the early 1980s as the successor organization to the Association of Students' Councils Canada (AOSC). Services made available to individual student members or member students' unions of the CFS include:CFS - Services * the International Student Identity Card (see below); * the StudentSaver Discount Card; * the Student Work Abroad Program (SWAP); * the National Student Health Network (NSHN), a non-profit health and dental benefits buying consortium; * a handbook and dayplanner producing service, which aims to reduce the cost per handbook to the individual students' unions, through economies of scale; * Digital services, including web services, a comprehensive web authoring solution for students' unions that allows them to easily publish and maintain database driven websites; *Sexual health products, where members can purchase products for their membership at reduced cost; * UFile, a partnership that allows students to file their taxes for free; * Ethical Purchasing Network (EPN), which uses members' collective purchasing power to buy goods that are ethically sourced. Products are fair trade, union- made, or sweatshop-free. Travel CUTS Travel CUTS (Canadian Universities Travel Service) is a travel agency that was majority-owned and operated by CFS-Services (CFS-S), which operates in Canada and the United States. In 2009, Travel CUTS was sold to Merit Travel Group. In 1996, the University Students' Council at the University of Western Ontario initiated a lawsuit against CFS- Services, to be later joined by three other student societies (Alma Mater Society of the University of British Columbia, Queen's Alma Mater Society and University of Alberta Students' Union). The plaintiffs \\"alleged the CFS- Services illegally transferred assets from the AOSC, including Travel CUTS, to itself at a 1987 meeting\\". A settlement was reached in 2006 through which the plaintiffs acquired 24 per cent of Travel CUTS and two seats on its board of directors.  International Student Identity Card  The CFS is the Canadian issuing agent for the International Student Identity Card (ISIC), an internationally recognized student identification that provides access to discounts on travel and other products. Only CFS members can obtain an ISIC at no charge. The ISIC sells for $20 to students who are not CFS members. The ISIC is considered to be the most direct financial benefit associated with CFS membership. Government relations A large part of the CFS' mandate is to lobby the federal government from its national office in Ottawa. Over the years, CFS representatives have testified to dozens of House of Commons committees, including the Standing Committee on Finance and the Standing Committee on Humans Resources Development and Persons with Disabilities (student loans). In 2009, the CFS national chairperson was invited to deliver a workshop on lobbying policy-makers at a conference hosted by the Federated Press. The 2016 federal budget included several of the CFS' lobbying recommendations, including a 50% increase to the Canada Student Grants program, a $165 million investment in the Youth Employment Strategy, and additional public research funding. In addition to the ongoing testimonies and meetings, the CFS holds an annual Lobby Week that brings together dozens of students from across Canada to meet with their local Members of Parliament and Senators. In 2017, over 150 meetings were held to lobby for eliminating domestic & international student tuition fees, student debt relief, investing in indigenous learners, and more graduate research funding. Legal cases (advocacy) Student loan bankruptcy In 1999 the CFS challenged the legality of the student loan bankruptcy prohibition. Translink and free speech The legally separate but closely related affiliate, the Canadian Federation of Students-British Columbia (CFS-BC), in participation with the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association and British Columbia Teachers' Federation, won a case against Translink for refusing to put CFS-BC Vote Education advertising on buses that Translink deemed to be partisan advertising during an election. The case was appealed all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, where it ruled that Translink's actions violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and in doing so, the Court set the precedent that \\"arms-length\\" government agencies such as Translink do come under Charter scrutiny. Injunction against Fair Elections Act In 2014, The Council of Canadians and the Canadian Federation of Students launched a challenge against the Fair Elections Act, which the organizations believed would disenfranchise Canadians and prevent the most marginalized people in our society from voting. While the matter is still before the courts, the Liberal government has promised to repeal the changes implemented by the Conservatives, which was the basis of the court challenge.http://main.cfs- fcee.ca/elections-act-changes-a-win-for-democracy/ Membership disputes Historically, the federation has had numerous legal disputes with student unions over its membership rules. Under its rules, student unions are contractually required to pay membership fees to the CFS, even if the student union leadership does not want to remain members of the organization. This arrangement has led to numerous legal battles between the federation and student unions wanting to leave or enter the organization. Cape Breton University In March, 2008, students at Cape Breton University held a vote to leave the CFS, with 92% of voting students supporting exiting the organization. Arguing that the vote failed to follow the organization's bylaws regarding notification of referenda, the CFS declined to recognize the results of the vote. After the referendum, the Cape Breton University Students Union (CBUSU) ceased collecting membership fees on behalf of the CFS. In 2009, the CFS filed suit for dues owed, and in 2015 the Ontario Superior Court ordered the CBUSU to pay $293,000 in unpaid membership fees, plus the CFS' legal expenses. In August, 2015, the CBUSU announced its decision to appeal. In September, 2015, a fourth year CBU student delivered a petition to the CBUSU signed by approximately 30% of the CBU student body seeking a new vote on exiting the CFS. However, the CFS' bylaws do not allow a member organization to hold an exit referendum while dues remain outstanding. Capilano University In March 2014, Capilano university students voted by referendum to terminate their membership. Concordia University The CFS is a defendant in a suit launched by the Concordia Students' Union seeking recognition of a vote to leave CFS in 2011. The National Executive refused to grant a disaffiliation vote before $1.8 million in alleged outstanding membership fees were remitted. The then-president of the Concordia Students' Union, Lex Gill, firmly denied this claim: \\"I am completely firm in my conviction that we do not owe the CFS $1.8 million and never have.\\" In 2015, CFS Entities and CSU reached an agreement that the CSU \\"membership has been terminated.\\" The Concordia Graduate Student Association (GSA) has also terminated its membership. The details of the agreement remain confidential. Post-Graduate Students‚Äô Society of McGill University In April 2010, members of the Post-Graduate Students‚Äô Society of McGill University (PGSS) voted 86% in favour of ending association with the CFS. The CFS did not recognize the results of this vote, leading the PGSS to file suit. The PGSS' lawsuit is still in progress. In January 2015, a second referendum on membership was held, following a court order against the CFS in response to a separate lawsuit filed by McGill Student Ge Sa seeking recognition of an exit petition forwarded by Sa in 2014. In the 2015 referendum, McGill graduate students voted 2014 to 56 in favour of leaving the CFS. Simon Fraser University The CFS was a defendant in a case brought by the Simon Fraser Student Society (SFSS) at Simon Fraser University over the validity of a vote to leave CFS in March 2008. After a summary trial was rejected, the judge ruled that the SFSS had the option of holding another vote or continuing to resolve the legality of the disputed referendum through a trial. The judge urged both parties to consider settling the matter out of court before spending large amounts of money on a full length trial.https://etacanadaonline.com/ (Article title unknown) In early January, 2012, the CFS/CFS-Services/CFS-British Columbia and the SFSS agreed to an undisclosed settlement and ceased all court action. University of Guelph The Central Student Association representing undergraduate University of Guelph students submitted an injunction on February 16, 2010 against the CFS and its affiliates for denying the student association a vote to leave CFS as a result of a dispute over the validity of a petition required to initiate the referendum. Justice O'Connor of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ordered that a vote be conducted and administered by a referendum oversight committee (ROC) based on CFS bylaws (consisting of two representatives selected by the CFS and two representatives selected by the student association). Justice O'Connor modified the committee by appointing former Ontario Superior Court Justice James Chadwick as a fifth member of the committee to act as an independent third party to break deadlocks should the two parties disagree on administration of the vote. The court-ordered referendum was conducted online in early April 2010. Guelph students allegedly voted 73.5% in favour of leaving CFS in an online poll conducted by the university administration. CFS and CFS-O appealed Justice O'Connor's decision and the matter was held on May 31, 2011 though the application Judge, Justice O'Connor, failed to provide any reasons for the decision, making it impossible to review the appeal. The Appeals Court Judges ordered the matter be heard by a different Judge. University of Victoria The University of Victoria Students' Society (UVSS) representing undergraduate University of Victoria students submitted legal action against the CFS in November 2010 to seek a vote to leave the Federation. The dispute centered around a petition submitted by UVic student Jose Barrios in the Fall of 2009 that had the required 10% of signatures needed to initiate a referendum. In Spring 2010, the CFS National Executive rejected this petition because hundreds of students signed a second petition calling for their names to be removed from Barrios' petition list. In November 2010, Barrios initiated legal action against the CFS. Mr. Justice Malcolm D. Macaulay of the Supreme Court of British Columbia heard oral arguments from both sides on January 6 and 7, 2011. On February 1, 2011, Justice Macaulay ruled that the use of a 'counterpetition' to nullify the original petition 'must fail' and ordered that the process to hold a referendum on continued membership must move forward. On the applicability of the second 'counterpetition', Justice Macaulay wrote: \\"The national executive of the CFS invoked a process that was not contemplated by the bylaws in effect at the time and, as a result, applied an irrelevant consideration in determining that the petition was not in order. The adoption of a process outside the bylaws amounted to an excess of jurisdiction.\\" The CFS refused to grant a decertification vote until the UVSS paid $100,000+ in outstanding membership dues. The UVSS rejected the claim that it owed money and took the CFS to court on February 17. The UVSS argued that by bringing up this issue so late, the CFS was making an intentional move to delay a vote from occurring before the end of the 2010-2011 academic year. Justice Macaulay ruled for the vote to take place regardless of outstanding dues. In March 2011 UVic undergraduate students voted to leave the Canadian Federation of Students. The National Federation recognized the result, but the CFS-BC refused, claiming the vote did not apply to the provincial affiliate. A subsequent legal battle ensued, leading to a new successful UVSS petition effort to trigger a CFS-BC membership vote. In 2013, one month before the UVSS was scheduled to vote on its CFS-BC membership, the CFS-BC voted to terminate the UVSS's membership, marking the official end of all UVSS membership ties to the Canadian Federation of Students. Selkirk College The Selkirk College Students' Union representing all Selkirk College students submitted a petition for a vote on continued membership in the CFS in December 2016. The CFS verified that the petition was valid in early 2017. However, no referendum was scheduled by the Canadian Federation of Students at Selkirk College. The Students' Union asserts that its members followed the process, and that there is no reason not to move forward with a referendum. The CFS asserts that its ongoing dispute with the British Columbia Federation of Students means that students at Selkirk College cannot have a vote on continued membership. BCFS Expelled After years of dispute, a motion expelling all 12 members of the BCFS was unanimously passed, in the opening plenary of the 71 Semi- annual NGM. Resolving conflict.  Criticism  The CFS has been criticized and remains a controversial topic in student politics. The CFS has been labeled as anti-semitic by many Canadian Jewish organizations. During the 2019 CFS Referendum at Carleton University, B‚Äônai Brith Canada, StandWithUs Canada, Hasbara Fellowships Canada, and Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity released a letter calling on Ontario university students to opt-out of paying dues to CFS due to the organization's support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctioning of Israel. The CFS has been criticized for its management of the mandatory student-paid fees that it collects. For instance, a forensic audit conducted by accounting firm Grant Thornton LLP uncovered a hidden bank account controlled by the CFS with over $260,000 inside. The CFS failed to release the full forensic review as to what these unauthorized funds were spent on between July 2010 and December 2014. Another area of criticism has been the CFS's strict processes for decertification. The CFS is also criticised for being ineffective, with one student stating that \\"They don‚Äôt put enough emphasis on focused lobbying of elected officials, and continue to prefer the protests and sit-ins.\\" This criticism has been dismissed by many given the organization's annual Lobby Week where students from across the country meet with MPs and senators to push for affordable post-secondary education, and the CFS's presence on a variety of government committees. On the other hand, some Quebec student unions criticized the CFS for being too focused on government lobbying. The more radical protest focused culture of Quebec student politics was seen are incommensurate with the moderate CFS agenda. When student unions hold referendums on joining the CFS, many CFS staff members campaign on campuses, despite not being students. In instances where students have voted to leave the CFS, the federation has opted to use student money to sue these schools for democratically choosing to leave the organization.

It drains a rugged region of the Klamath Mountains along the Pacific north of Port Orford. It rises in the mountains of northern Curry County, south of Sugarloaf Mountain in the Rogue River ‚Äì Siskiyou National Forest. It flows generally west, through Grassy Knob Wilderness and the small community of Sixes, and eventually enters the Pacific just north of Cape Blanco, the westernmost point in Oregon. The mouth of the river is along the coast in Cape Blanco State Park. Name Accounts vary as to the origin of the name \\"Sixes\\". One local postmaster said Sixes was named for a Native American chief. Another source said that in 1851, the river was usually called the \\"Sikhs River\\" after the Chinook Jargon word for \\"friend\\", and on maps it was called the \\"Sequalchin River\\". Another source says the Native American name for the river was \\"Sa-qua-mi\\". Hodge's Handbook of American Indians says that one of the variants of the name of the local tribe, the Kwatami (a subdivision of the Tututni), was \\"Sik-ses-tene\\", which is said to mean \\"people by the far north country\\". Though this is most likely the real source of the name, the spelling \\"Sixes\\" was probably used by miners drawn to the Oregon gold rush who were familiar with the Chinook word \\"sikhs\\". The current spelling was used as early as 1855. Copper Salmon Wilderness In 2009, along the north and south forks of the Elk River and the upper Middle Fork Sixes River were designated as the Copper Salmon Wilderness. The area contains one of the nation's largest stands of low-elevation old-growth forest. Wildlife species include salmon, steelhead, coastal cutthroat trout, marbled murrelets, northern spotted owls, and Roosevelt elk, among others. Tributaries Named tributaries from source to mouth are Murphy Canyon, Haines Creek, North Fork Sixes River, Sugar and Sucker creeks, followed by the Middle Fork Sixes River. Below this come Big and Otter creeks, then the South Fork Sixes River. Further downstream are Elephant Rock, Little Dry, Pipeline, Dry, Edson, Koch, Jenny, Beaver, and Crystal creeks.

He was the tenth Governor of North Dakota. Biography Burke was born in Keokuk County, Iowa of Irish ancestry to John and Mary (n√©e Ryan) Burke. He graduated from the University of Iowa with a law degree in 1886. He married Mary E. Kane, a teacher, on August 22, 1891, and they had a son, Thomas, and two daughters, Elizabeth and Marian. Career Burke's legal career was established in Iowa and Minnesota before he moved to the Dakota Territory. After North Dakota was admitted to the union, he served in the state's House of Representatives in 1891 and in its Senate from 1893 to 1896. He served three terms (1907‚Äì1913) as the tenth Governor of North Dakota. At the 1912 Democratic National Convention in Baltimore, Burke enthusiastically supported the candidacy of Woodrow Wilson. Burke swung all of North Dakota's votes to Wilson on the first ballot. William Jennings Bryan, himself a supporter of Wilson and also a good friend of Burke's, wanted Burke to run for Vice-President. Burke demurred, however, due to a promise he had given Indiana delegates for their votes. As a result, Thomas R. Marshall of Indiana was chosen for Vice-President. Burke was named United States Treasurer following Wilson‚Äôs election victory in November 1912. From 1913 to 1921 Burke was Treasurer of the United States, under President Woodrow Wilson. Burke ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate in 1916. Death and legacy He later served as a justice of the North Dakota Supreme Court from 1924 until his death on May 14, 1937. Burke County, North Dakota is named in his honor. His remains are interred in Saint Mary's Cemetery, Bismarck, North Dakota. The State of North Dakota donated a statue of Burke to the United States Capitol's National Statuary Hall Collection in 1963.

In addition, Kyocera released in September 1999 the Kyocera VP-210 Visual Phone which had a front-facing 110,000-pixel CMOS camera for video calling and selfie photos. The VP-210 could send its still images as mail attachments or send video at 2 frames per second over a PHS network.

In the study of religion, orthopraxy is correct conduct, both ethical and liturgical, as opposed to faith or grace. Orthopraxy is in contrast with orthodoxy, which emphasizes correct belief, and ritualism, the practice of rituals. The word is a neoclassical compound‚Äî (orthopraxia) meaning 'right practice'. While orthodoxies make use of codified beliefs, in the form of creeds, and ritualism more narrowly centers on the strict adherence to prescribed rites or rituals, orthopraxy is focused on issues of family, cultural integrity, the transmission of tradition, sacrificial offerings, concerns of purity, ethical system, and the enforcement thereof. In Hinduism, orthopraxy and ritualism are not easily disentangled. Judaism is also considered both a religion and orthopraxy as it guides its adherents in both practice and belief.Biale, David, Not in the Heavens: The Tradition of Jewish Secular Thought, Princeton University Press, 2011, p.15 Etymology From the Greek orthos \\"straight\\" + praxis \\"action\\", first used in 1851,Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 3rd ed there are two versions of the term: \\"orthopraxis\\" and \\"orthopraxy\\".Oxford English Dictionary \\"Orthopraxy\\" is the older and more common term. Christianity Ten Commandments monument at the Texas State Capitol. Although traditionally Christianity is seen as primarily orthodoxical (as in the Nicene Creed's \\"I believe in ...\\"), some Christian denominations and leaders today, from Roman Catholic to Evangelical Christians, have started to describe their religions as both orthodoxical and orthopraxic. The premise is correct belief compels correct action, and incorrect action is caused by incorrect beliefs.See also: John 5:1‚Äì18; 8:13‚Äì19; 10:24‚Äì33; 11:45‚Äì54; 18‚Äì19:16 (Demonstrates how correct/incorrect belief causes correct/incorrect action from a biblical perspective.) Taking this combination of \\"correct belief\\" and \\"correct action\\" a step further, prosperity theology, found in charismatic and Pentecostal traditions, teaches correct religious belief and behavior receives material reward and physical healing, in addition to being a necessary component for accepting God's grace. Prosperity theology is a concept known as reciprocity when discussing traditional or ethnic religions such as that in Ancient Greece, but is limited to correct behavior over any one theological idea. The applicability of biblical law in Christianity is disputed. Most Christians believe that some or all of the Ten Commandments are still binding or have been reinstituted in the law of Christ. A minority of Christians are Torah-observant and at the other extreme are antinomian and Christian anarchistic views. Eastern Christianity Praxis is a key to understanding the Byzantine tradition, which is observed by the Eastern Orthodox Church and some Eastern Catholic Churches. This is because praxis is the basis of the understanding of faith and works as conjoint, without separating the two. The importance of praxis, in the sense of action, is indicated in the dictum of Saint Maximus the Confessor: \\"Theology without action is the theology of demons.\\"Virginia Fabella, Sergio Torres (editors), Doing Theology in a Divided World (Orbis Books 1985 ), p. 15Paul W. Chilcote, Wesley Speaks on Christian Vocation (Wipf and Stock 2001 ), p. 67Mission among Other Faiths: An Orthodox Perspective Union with God, to which Christians hold that Jesus invited man, requires not just faith, but correct practice of faith. This idea is found in the Scriptures (1 Cor 11:2, 2 Thes 2:14) and the Church Fathers, and is linked with the term praxis in Byzantine theology and vocabulary. In the context of Orthodoxy, praxis is mentioned opposite theology, in the sense of 'theory and practice'. Rather, it is a word that means, globally, all that Orthodox do. Praxis is 'living Orthodoxy'. Praxis is perhaps most strongly associated with worship. \\"Orthopraxis\\" is said to mean \\"right glory\\" or \\"right worship\\"; only correct (or proper) practice, particularly correct worship, is understood as establishing the fulness glory given to God. This is one of the primary purposes of liturgy (divine labor), the work of the people. Some Byzantine sources maintain that in the West, Christianity has been reduced \\"to intellectual, ethical or social categories,\\" whereas right worship is fundamentally important in our relationship to God, forming the faithful into the Body of Christ and providing the path to \\"true religious education.\\" A \\"symbiosis of worship and work\\" is considered to be inherent in Byzantine praxis. Hinduism In the case of Hinduism orthopraxy and ritualism are conflated. Emphasis on ritual vs. personal salvation (moksha) was a major division in classical Hindu philosophy, epitomized by Purva Mimamsa vs. Uttara Mimamsa (Vedanta). Ritual (puja) continues to play a central role in contemporary Hinduism, but the enormous complexity of ancient ritual (yajna) only survives in a tiny minority of Shrauta practitioners. Even Hindus who diligently practice a subset of prescribed rituals are called orthoprax, to contrast them with other Hindus who insist on the importance of correct belief or understanding. The correctness of one's interpretation of the scripture is then considered less important than following traditions. For example, Srinivasa Ramanujan was a well-known example of an orthoprax Hindu. In terms of \\"proper conduct\\" and other ethical precepts within the Hindu framework, the core belief involves the divinity of each individual soul (jivatma). Each person harbors this \\"indwelling God (divinity)\\"; thus, conduct which unifies society and facilitates progress is emphasized. Self-centered existence is discouraged as a result of this jivatma concept. The Uttara Mimamsa philosophical school explicates this concept eloquently. Moreover, within the context of Uttara Mimamsa the role of puja (ritual) also involves bringing the individual jivatma closer to the Paramatma (the Transcendent Divinity or God). Individuals who have attained this merging then become the spiritual guides to the community. Later developments within the Hindu religious and philosophic tradition thus try to unify these concepts of ritual, proper conduct, and personal salvation instead of leaving them in mutually conflicting terms. The movement inspired by Pandurang Shastri Athavale termed Swadhyaya seems to be one manifestation of this syncretism. However, other movements within the contemporary Hindu scene are also moving towards this union of external activity and internal development. Islam Islam generally stresses orthopraxy over orthodoxy, but since the practice is held to come from doctrine, this is essentially orthodoxy applied to practice. Jainism Karma as action and reaction: if we sow goodness, we will reap goodness. Jain orthopraxy is based on two factors: Jain siddhanta (teachings of the Tirthankara) and kriya (practices prevalent at the time of the Tirthankaras). According to Jains, the Tirthankaras based their teachings and philosophy after knowing the realities on this universe (like dravya and tattva). Based on these realities, they propounded true and eternal principles like ahimsa, truth, karma etc. that govern the universe. Jain rituals were codified on the basis of these principles to give effect to the teachings of the Tirthankaras. Judaism certified as kosher by the Orthodox Union. Judaism attaches primary importance to the practice of the mitzvot, and that each act of daily life comply with the ethical and ritual teachings of the Torah. However, these gestures are intended to be motivated by the system of values and ethics of which they are a part, so that orthodoxy is not seen as simply a way of thinking according to established dogmas. Shema Yisrael recitation Moreover, Maimonides codifies his 13 principles of faith as a binding theological dogma, and according to Maimonides some laws of the Torah require the acceptance of certain basic beliefs, such as the first and second positive commandments in Maimonides' Sefer Hamitzvot, which mandate the belief in God and his indivisible unity, or the recitation of the Shema. Maimonides' codification of Jewish law even contains a section entitled Yesodei HaTorah, which delineates the required beliefs of Judaism. Neopaganism British Traditional Wicca is highly orthopraxic, with \\"traditions\\" (as denominations in Wicca are called) being precisely that‚Äîdefined by what is traditionally done, rather than shared beliefs.SilverWitch, Sylvana (1995). \\"A Witch in the Halls of Wisdom: Northwest Legend Fritz Muntean Discusses School, Theology, and the Craft\\", in Widdershins Vol. 1, Issue 3 (Lammas 1995). Other Neopagans may or may not share this quality, as noted by James R. Lewis, who draws a distinction between \\"Religious Neo-Pagans\\" and \\"God/dess Celebrants.\\" Lewis states the majority of the neopagan movement is strongly opposed to religionist traditions that incorporate any form of orthopraxy or orthodoxy. In fact, many Neopagan organizations, when discussing orthopraxy, limit themselves solely to ritualism. Polytheistic reconstructionism Reconstructionist religions make full use of orthopraxy, defining their practices as a lifestyle, and identifying correct action as living life in accord with specific ideals and principles, rather than focusing solely on ritual or promoting a single cosmology, metaphysical idea, or theological theory as absolute truth.

Temple Emanu-El Cemetery, a Reform Judaism burial ground is within the Mount Royal grounds. The burial ground shares the mountain with the much larger adjacent Roman Catholic cemetery, Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery, and the Shaar Hashomayim Cemetery, an Ashkenazi Jewish cemetery. Mount Royal Cemetery is bordered on the southeast by Mount Royal Park, on the west by Notre-Dame-des- Neiges Cemetery and on the north by Shaar Hashomayim Cemetery. Although the cemetery is non-denominational today, it continues to be governed by its original charter with a board of trustees representing the founding Protestant denominations. The cemetery is a private non-profit organization. Burial rights have always been offered in perpetuity, with the commitment that no graves would ever be reused or abandoned. The founding charter stipulates that all profits should be entirely devoted to the embellishment and improvement of the property. Mount Royal Cemetery is in operation and even the old portion of the cemetery still has some burial sites available. Design A memorial laid in honour of veterans at the War Graves section of the cemetery. Crematory The first crematory in Canada was built by Sir Andrew Taylor in 1901 on the eastern side of the Mount Royal Cemetery property with funds donated by Sir William Christopher Macdonald, a well-known tobacco tycoon and great philanthropist. This building is the oldest of its kind in the country and it remained the only crematorium in Quebec until 1975. The first cremation took place on April 18, 1902. Built with Montreal limestone, the original building had a chapel, a room for the cremation chambers, a large winter storage vault and a conservatory filled with exotic plants. In the 1950s, for maintenance reasons, the conservatory was demolished but the original chapel, on the left of the building, is still intact with a beautiful hand made mosaic floor. War Graves section The cemetery contains 459 war graves of Commonwealth service personnel, 276 from World War I and 183 from World War II, most of which form two War Plots in Section G. A Cross of Sacrifice stands on the boundary with Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery. Military graves at Mount Royal did not take significance until World War I, when Canada lost over 60 000 soldiers. After this event, the population of the city started looking toward public memory more seriously, and gave an entire section to war veterans and fallen soldiers.Young, Brian with photographs by Geoffrey James.

It was built as a private residence for Isaac Singer (1811‚Äì1875), and rebuilt by his son Paris Singer in the style of the Palace of Versailles. History 19th century Around 1871, the Fernham estate in Paignton was purchased by Isaac Singer, the founder of the Singer Sewing Machine Company. The old buildings on the site were demolished and he commissioned a local architect, George Soudon Bridgman, to build a new mansion as his home. As part of the designs, Singer instructed Bridgman to build a theatre within the house. Bridgman was at that time being apprenticed by a young Frank Matcham, who had just returned from London where he had been studying architecture in a surveyors office.\\"Growing Up On The English Riviera\\" by Gorel Garlick; Wilmore, pp. 44‚Äì49. In an edition of The Builder, dated 1873, Matcham was named in the request for tender section as being the accepted party to work alongside Bridgman on the Oldway Mansion project.\\"Tenders\\", The Builder, 1 March 1873, p. 176. The architectural historian Gorel Garlick considers it entirely possible that Matcham was given sole responsibility by Bridgman for the theatre's design because of his educational experiences in London. Singer spared no cost in terms of Oldway Mansion's construction; he sourced the finest materials from around the world and instructed Bridgman to design the interior in exuberant French style. Garlick notes that it was highly likely that Singer's exuberance would have influenced someone as architecturally impressionable as Matcham, whose later theatres used such extravagant decoration. The work was completed in 1873 Singer died on 23 July 1875, shortly before work on the original mansion was completed. The grand staircase at Oldway Mansion with The Crowning of Josephine by Napoleon after David. Paris Singer, a son of Isaac Singer, supervised the alterations at Oldway Mansion between 1904 and 1907. The rebuilding work was modelled on the Palace of Versailles, and the eastern elevation of the building was inspired by the Place de la Concorde in Paris. The interior of the building is noted for its grand staircase made from marble, and balusters of bronze. The ceiling of the staircase is decorated with an ornate painting based on an original design for the Palace of Versailles for Louis XIV by the French painter and architect Charles Le Brun. Above the grand staircase, there is a reproduction of the first version of Jacques-Louis David's painting The Crowning of Josephine by Napoleon. The original was purchased by Paris Singer in the late 19th century; the painting was sold to the French government in 1946 and now hangs in the Palace of Versailles. The reproduction at the mansion, which hangs in the same place as the original did, is a copy made by Rutters Scanachrome and was unveiled in 1995. The gallery on the first floor is a reproduction of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, and it is floored in parquet. The gallery leads into the ballroom, which contains walls of gilt panelling and mirrors. Above the fireplace, there is an oil painting of Louis de Bourbon dating from 1717. Oldway Mansion is set in of gardens, which were laid out on an Italian theme by the French landscape gardener Achille Duchesne. Beneath the eastern elevation of the building is the maze, which consists of dwarf box hedging and flower beds. To the south of the mansion, there is a grotto garden, where a waterfall passes over a rocky cave into a pool below. The grounds of the mansion contain many sub-tropical plants and shrubs. The eastern and northern elevations of Oldway Mansion Opposite the main entrance to the mansion is a large round building known as The Rotunda. This was built in 1873, and it was used originally as a horse riding pavilion and exercise area. Isaac Singer gave this building the nickname of \\"The Wigwam\\". The formal gardens and parkland are Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. 20th century A rock garden was laid out between 1900 and 1902 by Devon landscape gardener FW Meyer using 1,000 tonnes of stone. Following the end of an affair with the dancer Isadora Duncan in 1917, Paris Singer became an American citizen and went to live in the United States. This was done partly for tax reasons, and after 1918, Oldway Mansion was no longer the permanent home of the Singer family. During the period of the First World War from 1914 to 1918, Oldway Mansion was transformed into the American Women's War Relief Hospital. The Rotunda was converted to house rows of beds for the wounded soldiers being brought back to England from the trenches of France and Belgium. King George V visited the mansion in 1915. Oldway Mansion became the Torbay Country Club in 1929. During this period, tennis courts and a bowling green were added to the grounds. Torbay Golf & Country Club opened in 1933. Oldway Mansion was used as the club house, with the course in the hills above the Mansion. The course closed in the mid-1950s.Torbay Golf & Country Club, \\"Golf's Missing Links\\". Retrieved 8 November 2014. During the Second World War from 1939 to 1945, Oldway was used in the war effort by housing RAF cadets training to be aircrew. In 1943, Oldway was damaged in an air raid, along with many other buildings in Paignton. Modern history and disuse of the building Paignton Urban District Council purchased Oldway Mansion from the Singer family in 1946 for ¬£46,000. It is estimated that around ¬£200,000 was spent on building the mansion. Until 2013, the building was used as council offices and for civil marriage ceremonies. Oldway Mansion has been a Grade II* listed building since 1993. In January 2007, Torbay Council announced that it was considering selling the mansion, as it had become too expensive to maintain. The suggestion was controversial since local residents argued that the mansion was sold at a reduced price on the understanding that it would be open to the public. On 30 April 2012, plans for Oldway Mansion to be converted into a luxury hotel and sheltered retirement flats were approved by Torbay Council. The deal was finalised in September 2012. Oldway Mansion has been closed since Torbay Council stopped using the buildings in 2013, although the grounds have remained open to the public. The bowling green is still in use, but the tennis courts are closed. In January 2016, it was reported that the property developer Akkeron had filed a claim for more than ¬£8 million in damages against Torbay Council, due to a dispute over the leases which it said had caused a delay in starting work on the redevelopment. Torbay Council rejected the claim and said that it would defend itself against the allegations \\"robustly\\". On 15 August 2016, it was reported that the agreement between Torbay Council and Akkeron to develop the mansion had been terminated. The legal dispute brought an end to the redevelopment plans, and the work on the site was never started. A 2018 proposal by the elected Mayor of Torbay to sell the building was rejected by councillors. In January 2019, it was announced that Torbay Council had begun the process of setting up a charitable trust to allow community management of the building, with the aim of re- opening it. In March 2019, it was reported that planned open days allowing the public to see inside the mansion had been scrapped, as the building was in an unsafe condition. A bid was submitted to the National Lottery Heritage Fund for approximately ¬£10 million to support a restoration scheme. By 2020 the grotto, which is made of steel and concrete and lined with limestone, had deteriorated and become subject to vandalism leaving it at risk of collapse. As a result of this Torbay Council applied for planning permission to temporarily seal up the grotto using steel mesh. Other uses Oldway Mansion has been used as a film location on several occasions. During the spring of 2004, it doubled as Buckingham Palace for the filming of Churchill: The Hollywood Years, starring Christian Slater and Neve Campbell. Pink gravel, guard houses and period vehicles were used to recreate the royal courtyard. The 1968 film Isadora starring Vanessa Redgrave and telling the life story of the dancer Isadora Duncan also used Oldway Mansion as one of its locations. On 21 December 2005, the ballroom at Oldway Mansion was the location for Devon's first civil partnership. The registration was officially witnessed by the Mayor of Torbay and his dignitaries.\\"Gay couples among first to 'wed'\\", BBC News. 21 December 2005.

It is native across Europe. The species is widely cultivated and has escaped into the wild in many regions. Ribes rubrum is a deciduous shrub normally growing to tall, occasionally , with five-lobed leaves arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are inconspicuous yellow- green, in pendulous racemes, maturing into bright red translucent edible berries about diameter, with 3‚Äì10 berries on each raceme. An established bush can produce of berries from mid to late summer. Cultivation Redcurrant berries There are several other similar species native in Europe, Asia and North America, also with edible fruit. These include Ribes spicatum (northern Europe and northern Asia), Ribes alpinum (northern Europe), R. schlechtendalii (northeast Europe), R. multiflorum (southeast Europe), R. petraeum (southwest Europe) and R. triste (North America; Newfoundland to Alaska and southward in mountains). While Ribes rubrum and R. nigrum are native to northern and eastern Europe, large berried cultivars of the redcurrant were first produced in Belgium and northern France in the 17th century. In modern times, numerous cultivars have been selected; some of these have escaped gardens and can be found in the wild across Europe and extending into Asia.Verlag, Orbis \\"Orbis Naturf√ºhrer\\", 2000, The white currant is also a cultivar of Ribes rubrum. Although it is a sweeter and albino variant of the redcurrant, not a separate botanical species, it is sometimes marketed with names such as Ribes sativum or Ribes silvestre, or sold as a different fruit. Close-up of blossom Currant bushes prefer partial to full sunlight and can grow in most types of soil. They are relatively low-maintenance plants and can also be used as ornamentation. Cultivars Many redcurrant and whitecurrant cultivars are available for domestic cultivation from specialist growers. The following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit:- *‚ÄòJonkheer van Tets‚Äô *‚ÄòRed Lake‚Äô *‚ÄòStanza‚Äô *‚ÄôWhite Grape‚Äô (whitecurrant) Culinary uses A fruiting redcurrant bush near an abandoned house in a semi-deserted village in Yaroslavl Oblast, Russia at 59 degrees northern latitude With maturity, the tart flavour of redcurrant fruit is slightly greater than its blackcurrant relative, but with the same approximate sweetness. The white- fruited variant of redcurrant, often referred to as white currant, has the same tart flavour but with greater sweetness. Although frequently cultivated for jams and cooked preparations, much like the white currant, it is often served raw or as a simple accompaniment in salads, garnishes, or drinks when in season. Redcurrant cuttings In the United Kingdom, redcurrant jam is a condiment often served with lamb, game meat including venison, turkey and goose in a festive or Sunday roast. It is essentially a jam and is made in the same way, by adding the redcurrants to sugar, boiling, and straining. In France, the highly rarefied and hand-made Bar-le-duc or 'Lorraine jelly' is a spreadable preparation traditionally made from white currants or alternatively redcurrants.T. K. Lim The pips are taken off by hand, originally by Monks, with a goose feather, before cooking.Heather Arndt Anderson In Scandinavia and Schleswig-Holstein, it is often used in fruit soups and summer puddings (r√∏dgr√∏d, rote gr√ºtze or rode gr√ºtt). In Germany it is also used in combination with custard or meringue as a filling for tarts. In Linz, Austria, it is the most commonly used filling for the Linzer torte.Haywood, A and Walker, K \\"Upper Austria - Linz\\", Lonely Planet - Austria p. 207 It can be enjoyed in its fresh state without the addition of sugar. In German-speaking areas, syrup or nectar derived from the redcurrant is added to soda water and enjoyed as a refreshing drink named Johannisbeerschorle. It is so named because the redcurrants (Johannisbeeren, \\"John's berry\\" in German) are said to ripen first on St. John's Day, also known as Midsummer Day, June 24. In Russia, redcurrants are ubiquitous and used in jams, preserves, compotes and desserts. It is also used to make 'Kisel or Kissel' (a sweet healthy drink). Mixed with fresh berries or fruits (such as red currants, cherries, cranberries, apples). The leaves have many uses in traditional medicine, such as making an infusion with black tea.Thomas Andrew Also the plants were cultivated in Russian monastery gardens in the 11th century. Nutrition and phytochemicals In a 100 gram serving, redcurrants (or white) supply 56 calories and are a rich source of vitamin C, providing 49% of the Daily Value (DV, table). Vitamin K is the only other essential nutrient in significant content at 10% of DV (table). Phytochemicals Redcurrant fruits are known for their tart flavor, a characteristic provided by a relatively high content of organic acids and mixed polyphenols. As many as 65 different phenolic compounds may contribute to the astringent properties of redcurrants, with these contents increasing during the last month of ripening. Twenty-five individual polyphenols and other nitrogen-containing phytochemicals in redcurrant juice have been isolated specifically with the astringent flavor profile sensed in the human tongue.

Prior to his appointment at JFNA, he served as president and CEO of Hillel International from 2013 to 2019.Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life Earlier, he served as the corporate Vice President of Education and STEM Learning business at Battelle Memorial Institute, Chancellor of the Ohio Board of Regents, Ohio state senator and member of the United States House of Representatives for one term. Fingerhut was appointed Chancellor of the Ohio Board of Regents on March 14, 2007 by Governor Ted Strickland. This position is a member of the Ohio Governor's Cabinet. On February 22, 2011, he submitted his resignation to Gov. John Kasich, effective March 14, 2011, after serving four years of his five-year term. Chancellor Fingerhut earned a reputation as an innovative leader and ardent advocate of the value of higher education.  Early life and education  Fingerhut earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Northwestern University in 1981 and a law degree from Stanford University in 1984. He practiced law at Hahn Loeser & Parks LLP in Cleveland until becoming associate director of Cleveland Works, where he served from 1987 to 1989.  Career  In 1989 Fingerhut served as the campaign manager for Michael R. White, then a candidate for Mayor of Cleveland. After the successful campaign, Fingerhut became the director of White's mayoral transition team. Fingerhut served as member of the Ohio Senate from 1991 to 1993. In 1992, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Ohio's 19th congressional district and took office in 1993. In his re-election bid in 1994, however, Fingerhut was defeated by Lake County Prosecutor Steve LaTourette. After losing his seat in Congress, Fingerhut easily won a seat again in the Ohio Senate, representing district 25. He served two full terms from 1999 through 2007, retiring due to term limits. In 2004, Fingerhut was the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate seat of Republican George V. Voinovich, who was seeking a second term in that office after previous service as mayor of Cleveland and governor of Ohio. Both candidates were from the Cleveland area, but Fingerhut apparently could not dent Voinovich's longstanding popularity there and elsewhere in the state. Voinovich was handily re-elected, defeating Fingerhut 64%-36%.  Support for Israel  While representing Ohio's 19th congressional district in the 103rd Congress, Fingerhut was the co-sponsor of four bills in support of Israel. Including: H.R. 1407 confronted a boycott of the State of Israel by aiming \\"To prohibit government-to-government and commercial arms sales to any country that is participating in or cooperating with the boycott of Israel by Arab countries.\\" H.R. 3656 unequivocally voiced its support for Israel seeking to \\"restrict sales and leases of defense articles and defense services to any country or international organization which as a matter of policy or practice is known to have sent letters to United States firms requesting compliance with, or soliciting information regarding compliance with, the secondary or tertiary Arab boycott.\\"  Tenure at Hillel International  Very quickly after beginning his tenure as CEO of Hillel International, the organization experienced a major controversy. The Hillel chapter at Swarthmore College declared itself an \\"Open Hillel,\\" choosing to welcome all guest speakers and student organizations, whether or not they support Zionism. Fingerhut responded, stating \\"Let me be very clear ‚Äì \\"anti-Zionists\\" will not be permitted to speak using the Hillel name or under the Hillel roof, under any circumstances.\\" This controversy is widely seen as a key part of a broad conversation in the American Jewish community regarding whether or not Zionism is, or should be, a consensus issue. Beginning in March 2015, Fingerhut was involved in a controversy with J Street U, the student arm of J Street. Fingerhut initially accepted an invitation to speak at the national student group meeting, but subsequently withdrew. Fingerhut then issued a statement saying he had withdrawn out of \\"concerns regarding my participation amongst other speakers who have made highly inflammatory statements against the Jewish state.\\" Several people involved in US Jewish student life noted that in an era when the number of Jewish students engaging with Jewish and Israel-related campus groups is shrinking, it might be unproductive to alienate the 3,000 participants in the J Street conference, a population that included 40 Hillel professionals, and that Hillel donor pressure was the likely cause of Fingerhut's withdrawal.Hillel faces backlash after CEO Fingerhut withdraws from J Street Conference Haaretz, 19 March 2015 On March 23, 250 J Street students marched to Hillel headquarters, leaving letters for Fingerhut demanding a meeting with him and sharing their view that he caved to the demands of \\"more conservative donors instead of engaging with the full range of student voices ‚Äî including those on the more liberal end.\\"Tensions among U.S. Jews over Israel on display as Hillel leader pulls out of speech The Washington Post, 23 March 2015 Fingerhut then wrote to Benjy Cannon, the board president of J Street U and a senior at the University of Maryland, to arrange a meeting between the students and members of Hillel International‚Äôs board of directors. In his letter, Fingerhut said that there was \\"work to do in the Jewish community at large to be one people that respects, honors and celebrates its diversity rather than fearing it. This incident taught me just how deep the divide is. I don‚Äôt yet have all the answers to how we will bridge this divide, but as Hillel‚Äôs president, I am committed to working with you to find them and I have no doubt we will be successful.\\"Hillel Chief Eric Fingerhut to Meet with J Street Students The Jewish Daily Forward, 25 March 2015  Personal life  Eric Fingerhut is married to Amy Fingerhut and has two sons, Sam and Charlie.

It extends for approximately in a north‚Äìsouth direction through the U.S. state of Wyoming, east of the Idaho state line. It is south of Yellowstone National Park and most of the east side of the range is within Grand Teton National Park. One theory says the early French voyageurs named the range ' (\\"the three nipples\\") after the breast-like shapes of its peaks. Another theory says the range is named for the Teton Sioux (from Th√≠t»üu≈ãwa≈ã), also known as the Lakota people. Ullrich, Jan. (2008). New Lakota Dictionary. Lakota Language Consortium. It is likely that the local Shoshone people once called the whole range ', meaning \\"many pinnacles\\". The principal summits of the central massif, sometimes referred to as the Cathedral Group, are Grand Teton (), Mount Owen (), Teewinot (), Middle Teton () and South Teton (). Other peaks in the range include Mount Moran (), Mount Wister (), Buck Mountain () and Static Peak (). Geology Between six and nine million years ago, stretching and thinning of the Earth's crust caused movement along the Teton fault. The west block along the fault line rose to form the Teton Range, creating the youngest mountain range in the Rocky Mountains. The fault's east block fell to form the valley called Jackson Hole. The geological processes that led to the current composition of the oldest rocks in the Teton range began about 2.5 billion years ago. At that time, sand and volcanic debris settled into an ancient ocean. Additional sediment was deposited for millions of years and eventually heat and pressure metamorphosed the sediment into gneiss. Subsequently, magma was forced up through the cracks in the gneiss to form granite, anywhere from inches to hundreds of feet thick. Other intrusive igneous rocks are noticeable as the black dikes of diabase, visible on the southwest face of Mount Moran and on the Grand Teton. Starting during the Cambrian period, deep deposits of sedimentary rock were deposited in shallow seas over the metamorphic basement rocks. Erosion and uplift have exposed the metamorphic and intrusive igneous rocks now visible on the east slope of the range and in the Cathedral Group and the Paleozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rocks on the west slope. As recently as 2.1 million years ago the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff was deposited along the west slope of the north part of the range. The Teton Range rises dramatically above Jackson Hole One reason the Teton Range is famous is because of the dramatic elevation profile visible from the eastern side, which rises sharply from above the valley floor. Unlike most mountain ranges, the east side of the Teton Range lacks significant foothills or lower peaks which might obscure the view. This is due to the presence of the Teton Fault at the base of the east slope as well as the range being too young to have eroded into soft hills. The Snake River flows southward through the valley before turning to the west and entering Idaho. As a filming location The Tetons and Jackson Hole have been the setting for a number of films, including John Wayne's film acting debut in The Big Trail in 1930 and the western film classic Shane in 1953. Mount Moran and the surrounding mountains were used as a backdrop for the lake/swamp setting in the original television series Land of the Lost.

Course The Grande Ronde River rises in the Blue Mountains near the Anthony Lakes recreation area in the Wallowa‚ÄìWhitman National Forest in southwestern Union County approximately south of La Grande. It flows generally north along the east side of the Blue Mountains, then east, past La Grande, then generally northeast through the Grande Ronde Valley in a meandering course between the Blue Mountains and the Wallowa Mountains, receiving Catherine Creek east of La Grande. Approximately northwest of Minam it receives the Wallowa River from the southeast, then receives the Wenaha River at Troy just south of the Washington border. It crosses into southeastern Washington, traversing the extreme southeast corner of the state and entering the Snake at Rogersburg Washington, approximately north of the Oregon border and downstream from the mouth of the Salmon River. It receives Joseph Creek from the south upstream from its mouth on the Snake.

History The Grande Ronde River at Elgin, Oregon In the early 19th century, the valley of the river was inhabited by Nez Perce, Umatilla, Walla Walla, and Cayuse tribes of Native Americans. Numerous archaeological sites are on the public land around the river. The Grande Ronde River was given its name sometime before 1821 by French Canadian voyageurs working for the Montreal-based fur trading North West Company. Grande Ronde is a French name meaning \\"great round\\". A portion Grande Ronde and its valley were part of the Oregon Trail. It was first used by settlers in 1844 when Moses \\"Black\\" Harris led his party to the river from Fort Hall and then turned northwest to cross the Blue Mountains. Harris' navigation would be subsequently repeated, becoming a regular part of the Oregon Trail. The river was called the \\"Grand Round River\\" by at least one English-speaking traveler. In 1988, the United States Congress designated about of the river, from its confluence with the Wallowa River to the Oregon‚ÄìWashington border, as the Grande Ronde Wild and Scenic River, as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The river today is a popular destination for hunting, especially for game animals such as mule deer, elk, black bear, cougar, and bighorn sheep. Fishing, rafting and hiking are also popular along the designated Wild and Scenic portion of the river. Most of the middle reaches of the river are inaccessible to motor vehicles. Fish The Grande Ronde River supports populations of spring chinook salmon, summer steelhead, bull trout, mountain whitefish, as well as other species. The river has a sport steelhead fishery and has some tribal fishing for spring chinook.

He is perhaps best known for his work with Frank Sinatra in the 1940s at Columbia Records. With his sophisticated orchestrations, Stordahl is credited with helping to bring pop arranging into the modern age. Early years Stordahl was born in Staten Island, New York, United States, to Norwegian immigrant parents. He began his career as a trumpeter in jazz bands which played around Long Island and the Catskills during the late 1920s and early 1930s. He also began arranging around this time, and in 1933 he joined Bert Bloch's orchestra in both capacities. Over the next couple of years, Stordahl sang on the side in a vocal trio dubbed the Three Esquires. Big bands In 1936, he joined Tommy Dorsey's new orchestra and soon became the band's main arranger. The same year appeared their first big hit, \\"I'm Getting Sentimental Over You\\". The tune quickly became Dorser's theme song. In January 1940, Frank Sinatra joined the group as vocalist, and it became apparent that Stordahl's arrangements were particularly well suited to the singer's voice. Stordahl and Sinatra In January 1942, when Sinatra convinced Dorsey to let him record four songs without Dorsey, Stordahl arranged Sinatra's very first commercial solo recordings for the RCA Victor subsidiary label Bluebird, and when Sinatra left Dorsey later that year to go solo, Stordahl went with him and became his music director. In the subsequent decade, Sinatra cut around three hundred sides for Columbia Records, of which three quarters were arranged by Stordahl. In addition, Stordahl provided the orchestral backings, both as arranger and conductor, for several hundreds of songs in various Sinatra radio programs. He was the credited orchestrator for the 1945 Academy Award-winning picture Anchors Aweigh which starred Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. His most successful songs of that time were the likes of \\"You'll Never Know,\\" \\"Saturday Night Is the Loneliest Night of the Week,\\" \\"They Say It's Wonderful,\\" and \\"Mam'selle.\\" In 1946 they recorded the album The Voice which was the first album with 8 ballads. His other songs as a composer such as \\"I Should Care\\" (1945), \\"Day by Day\\" (1946), and \\"Night after Night\\" (1949) were written with Paul Weston and Sammy Cahn. Stordahl was admired for his skills in framing Sinatra's voice, creating a soft, opulent sound with swirling strings, understated rhythms and woodwinds. He was one of the first American arrangers to tailor his accompaniments to the vocal qualities of a specific singer. When Sinatra moved to Capitol Records in 1953, Stordahl arranged his first recording session there. Afterwards, however, Sinatra worked extensively with Nelson Riddle, who cultivated his jazz-oriented qualities, as well as Gordon Jenkins, Billy May, Don Costa, Neal Hefti, Quincy Jones, and others. Stordahl went on to work with other singers such as Bing Crosby, Doris Day, Eddie Fisher, Dinah Shore, Nat 'King' Cole and Dean Martin, among others. Although best known as an arranger, Stordahl also composed a number of songs of which Day by Day with music by Axel Stordahl and Paul Weston and lyrics by Sammy Cahn, is the best known. In 1961, Sinatra returned to collaborate with an ailing Stordahl for his final Capitol concept album, Point of No Return. Television Stordahl worked with Eddie Fisher's television program for four years and composed and orchestrated the theme to the popular television comedy series McHale's Navy. Alex Stordhal as Music Director for the Gisele MacKenzie TV Show, his credit appears on the credit roll. In 1953, Fisher was signed to do a twice-weekly 15-minute program on NBC television with Coca-Cola as sponsor. Audio of the program was recorded and broadcast on a delayed basis on NBC's radio network. Radio In addition to his work as conductor on Sinatra's radio program, Stordahl conducted the orchestra on Eddie Fisher's Coke Time show and worked on the radio version of Your Hit Parade. Personal life Stordahl married singer June Hutton (of the Pied Pipers) in 1951. They made some joint recordings for Capitol records. Honors In 1967, the Los Angeles chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences established a scholarship in Stordahl's memory at the University of California, Los Angeles. Only graduate students were eligible for the $300 scholarship through the music department. Death Stordahl died August 30, 1963, at the age of 50 of cancer in Encino, California. He was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

In 2013, she was recognized by Guinness World Records as \\"the most prolific video game voice actor (female)\\". Hale is featured in animation such as Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego?, The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest, The Powerpuff Girls, Codename: Kids Next Door, The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy, Brandy & Mr. Whiskers, Totally Spies! and Avatar: The Last Airbender as well as its continuation The Legend of Korra. She also voices Cinderella and Princess Aurora in various Disney Princess media of the 2000s and 2010s. Biography Early life and education Hale was born in Happy Valley- Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada. Her mother was what she called \\"a wandering master's degree pursuer\\", and her stepfather was a microbiologist. In an interview with Tom Bissell of The New Yorker, she described her biological father, James Learning, as an outdoorsman, he was also a prominent NunatuKavut elder and prominent environmental activist. She grew up in the American South, residing mainly in Montgomery and Birmingham, Alabama. When she was a teenager, she got a voice-over spot at a local radio station where she was paid 35 dollars just for talking. In 1982 she graduated from Alabama School of Fine Arts where she was in the theatre department and had interests in being in a rock band: \\"I started doing voice-over to pay for life and a PA system and everything else, and ended up that just sort of took over, acting took over.\\" While in high school she did more voice-over work for commercials and at age 17, she also worked as a production assistant. She attended Birmingham- Southern College, where she found the program's style was broader than what she wanted to do, and she was more interested in film acting than theatre acting; she graduated there with a business degree. She worked as an actress and continued doing voice-overs, commuting frequently between Birmingham and Atlanta, Georgia. Acting, voice-over in cartoons Her first big break in acting was in 1988 for the made-for-television movie A Father's Homecoming, which was an NBC movie of the week. She was also selected among a group of about six thousand girls in a nationwide search to be in several episodes of the Santa Barbara soap opera television series. After doing more regional work, she eventually moved to Los Angeles, where she took on sporadic guest roles typical for young actresses on shows such as Melrose Place, ER, and Charmed. Her first major voice-over role in cartoons was the main character Ivy in Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego? which was based on the computer game series. As it was her first cartoon, she sought extra classes and training. The show spanned multiple seasons until its final broadcast in 1999. Hale enjoyed the project and noted that it was one of the first network TV cartoons that met the educational requirements. Hale's next animation project was Skeleton Warriors where \\"there were ten cast members, [two] of whom were girls, and we blew stuff up and cartoon maimed each other every week.\\" The development of a tie-in video game for Carmen Sandiego gave her the opportunity to do her first ever voice-over for a video game. She describes her time with the game as a \\"really confusing experience\\" as it required a lot more lines and time than the show did. Her next major video game was with BioWare on their Baldur's Gate series on various roles, which would eventually lead to large roles in Mass Effect and other titles. Hale has been involved in many other cartoons. In 1994, she was cast as Felicia Hardy/Black Cat in Spider-Man, the first in a long line of Marvel Comics characters she has voiced. She plays Cinderella and Princess Aurora in various Disney projects. In 2003, Hale voiced Mrs. Little in the short-lived Stuart Little. Hale has provided the voice of lead character Sam and rival character Mandy in the French and Canadian-produced animated television series Totally Spies. In a 2004 interview, she said \\"I'm so happy that David (Michel, creator and producer), Jamie (Simone, voice director) and everyone gave me the opportunity to be part of the show, it's been one of my absolute favorite experiences.\\" She describes Sam as \\"smart and adventurous, but now you see more of her wacky side and her girly side as well,\\" and Mandy as a \\"total snot, which is fun too.\\" She voiced the two characters as well as others for the show's six seasons and its feature movie.  Further video game voice acting  She voiced Bastila Shan in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and returned for a brief appearance in the sequel Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II ‚Äì The Sith Lords. She later voiced the female version of Jaden Korr in Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy. In the BioWare MMOPRG Star Wars: The Old Republic, Hale voiced the Republic Trooper Female as well as the recurring NPC Jedi Grand Master Satele Shan. Hale interpreted the voices of Fall-From-Grace and Deionarra in the computer-role-playing-game Planescape: Torment. She is also known as the \\"voice\\" of Samus Aran in all three games in the Metroid Prime trilogy, providing grunts and screams as the player moves and takes damage. Hale is also known for playing several voices in the Metal Gear Solid series (Naomi Hunter in Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, and Emma Emmerich in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty). Hale was also the voice of Jean Grey in Wolverine and the X-Men and Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds as well as a small role in Swat Kats. She also voiced British mercenary Jennifer Mui in Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction and Mercenaries 2: World in Flames. In 2011, she was the voice of Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers) on Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes. She provided the voice of Leah in Diablo III, and appeared as Rosalind Lutece in BioShock Infinite. Hale also played the role of Krem, a trans man character in BioWare's Dragon Age: Inquisition.https://kotaku.com/bioware-put-a-lot-of-work-into-dragon- ages-trans-charac-1666924495 Hale was selected to voice Commander Shepard, the main player character in the Mass Effect series. She had said that she is very invested in helping to \\"create\\" the stories of video games, though she herself is not a gamer. Although Hale does object to certain lines if they seem out- of-character in other works, she prefers not to mess with the words for Shepard and BioWare. Although reports showed that only 18% of players chose to play as a female Shepard in Mass Effect 2, vocal support for her character was high, leading to the fan-driven nickname \\"FemShep\\", and an e-mail campaign to put her character on the cover of Mass Effect 3. She was nominated for \\"Best Performance by a Human Female\\" at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards, in 2012, she was nominated again for Mass Effect 3. Hale and fellow Commander Shepard voice actor Mark Meer in 2011.  Reception and influences  In an interview with The Geek Forge regarding her influences, Hale cited her peers in the voice acting world including Dee Baker, Frank Welker, Grey DeLisle, Tress MacNeille, Kath Soucie, April Winchell, and especially Phil LaMarr. She also admires the work of Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell in the Battlestar Galactica series, and Judi Dench's film and theater roles. Her peers and critics have noted her versatility in her roles: Michael Abbott, a professor at Wabash College who blogs about video games, said that she has made herself untraceable despite having voiced dozens of roles. Tom Bissell has noted that she has been referred as \\"a kind of Meryl Streep of the form\\". In another interview she said, \\"I love the anonymity. I could walk through Comic Con, and no matter how many people who might be a fan of what I do, we‚Äôre in proximity and no one knew. I‚Äôm invisible. If I‚Äôd have done as many on-camera roles as I‚Äôve done voiceover I couldn‚Äôt go to the grocery store in peace.\\" Hale also stated in the same interview that \\"as cheesy as it sounds, the player is the star of the game. That‚Äôs the beauty of games ‚Äì that it‚Äôs you that inhabits it. It‚Äôs not about someone else, it‚Äôs about that you get to be that person, and if I do my job right, I as a person disappear. Your experience is primary.\\" Personal life Hale lives in the Los Angeles, California area. She has a son. She has several pets. She enjoys the outdoors and has mentioned that she might have become an architect, because she likes to redo houses.

Tribute acts include individual performers who mimic the songs and style of an artist, such as Elvis impersonators covering the works of Elvis Presley or groups like The Iron Maidens, an all-female band that pays tribute to Iron Maiden. Many tribute bands, in addition to playing the music of an artist or group, also try to emulate the vocal styles and overall appearance of that group, to make as close an approximation as possible. Others introduce a twist on the original act; for example, Dread Zeppelin plays Led Zeppelin songs in a reggae style with a lead singer dressed up as Elvis Presley, while Gabba perform the songs of ABBA in the style of the Ramones. Tribute bands usually name themselves based on the original band's name (sometimes with a pun), or on one of their songs or albums. History The first tribute acts to emerge may have been Beatles tribute bands, such as The Buggs, who attempted to look and sound like The Beatles while playing their songs. However, one might argue that Elvis impersonators qualify as well. Neil Innes's band \\"The Rutles\\", a humorous take on the Beatles, achieved tremendous success with a film, All You Need Is Cash backed by George Harrison. In the Autumn of 1991 United Kingdom promoter Robert Reed was invited by John Tyrrell & Rod Stephen to Gothenburg, Sweden to watch a one-off show performed by their group Bjorn Again. This was due to Robert‚Äôs links with the Australian comedian Col Elliott. They were absolutely the finished product. London based agents were not interested in this tribute act performing ABBA songs. They did not understand that most people who liked ABBA were closet fans. Robert, with his experience of working with the group DOLLAR, realised that ABBA music was alive and well in gay venues. Combining this with the Aussie backpackers phenomenon in London, Robert invited Bjorn Again to the United Kingdom for a tour in the Spring of 1992. He came up with the idea for the group to change into their stage clothing before entering the arrival hall at Heathrow Airport. The paparazzi were alerted & in attendance. At the same time, a large group of Japanese tourists who had landed earlier were mingling with their tour guide. The only ‚Äòhook‚Äô Robert needed was to shout ‚ÄòABBA, ABBA‚Äô as he pointed to the door & the flashbulbs did the rest. Bjorn Again became a household name during the tour & the rest is history. Robert, also promoted The Australian Doors Show later the same year. Although initially created to honor the original bands, many tribute bands have grown to have their own fan base. Only One Direction have performed to hundreds of thousands of fans, have completed four UK theatre tours, and debuted in their own show on London's West End in October 2015. Those bands and artists that have inspired a cult following in their fans tend to have a significant tribute band presence as well, such as Lynyrd Skynyrd, Black Sabbath, Journey, Genesis, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Styx, Pink Floyd, AC/DC, Iron Maiden, Kiss, Madonna, The Misfits, Queen, Alice in Chains, Grateful Dead, Van Halen, ABBA, The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Cars, R.E.M., Rammstein, Neil Diamond, and Steely Dan. Tribute Act to Queen More recently, tribute acts have looked to capitalize on the success of the pop genre, with a heavy focus on newer acts such as One Direction, Adele, Take That, The Wanted, Taylor Swift, Britney Spears and Beyonc√©. In 1997, the British journalist Tony Barrell wrote a feature for The Sunday Times about the UK tribute-band scene, which mentioned bands including Pink Fraud, the Pretend Pretenders and Clouded House. In the piece, Barrell asserted that \\"the main cradle of the tribute band...is Australia. Starved of big names, owing to their reluctance to put Oz on their tour itineraries, Australians were quite unembarrassed about creating home-grown versions. Then, like an airborne seed, one of these bands just happened to drift to Britain.\\" The band in question was the ABBA tribute Bj√∂rn Again, who staged a successful publicity stunt in the early 1990s, arriving at Heathrow Airport in white one- piece outfits similar to the ones worn by ABBA on the cover of their 1976 album, Arrival. Other tribute acts such as The Beatnix (Beatles), Zeppelin Live, and The Australian Pink Floyd Show have experienced continued popularity for over a decade. In 1998, two men who were in a Blues Brothers tribute band changed their names officially by deed poll to Joliet Jake Blues and Elwood Jake Blues. They also are the only men in the UK to have their sunglasses on in their passport and driving licence photos. In 2000, filmmakers Jeff Economy and Darren Hacker produced the documentary film ...An Incredible Simulation, which examined the tribute band phenomenon. Produced separately and independently in 2001 was the documentary Tribute by directors Kris Curry and Rich Fox, which also covered the movement. In 2007, producers Allison Grace and Michelle Metivier produced a four-part documentary series called \\"Tribute Bands\\" for Global TV which features tributes to The Police, Queen, Rush and The Tragically Hip. In 2002, the first biography of a tribute band was published by SAF in London. Titled Being John Lennon, the book is a humorous account of life on the road in The Beatles' tribute \\"Sgt. Pepper's Only Dart Board Band\\", written by the group's founder, Martin Dimery. In 2003, Mandonna, an all-male tribute to Madonna, was formed in response to the rise of all- female tribute acts such as The Iron Maidens, Lez Zeppelin and AC/DShe. In 2005, original Lynyrd Skynyrd members Ed King (co-author of \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\"), drummers Artimus Pyle and Bob Burns, and \\"Honkettes\\" Leslie Hawkins and JoJo Billingsley all played with The Saturday Night Special Band, a Lynyrd Skynyrd tribute from New York. This was the first tribute band to be composed of more original members than the current touring lineup of Lynyrd Skynyrd. In 2005, tribute band Beatallica received attention when they were threatened with a lawsuit by Sony Music Entertainment over their unique interpretation of Beatles songs done in a Metallica style. With the help of Metallica drummer/co-founder Lars Ulrich, Beatallica won their legal battle, and still record and tour today. Original Deep Purple drummer Ian Paice has played with members of the Deep Purple tribute band Purpendicular in 2002, 2004 and 2007, and the whole band on European tours in December 2008, March 2012 (which included a surprise appearance of original Deep Purple bassist Roger Glover in Switzerland), October 2014, March 2015, March 2016, December 2018 and August 2019. David Brighton, (whose act \\"Space Oddity ‚Äì David Brighton's Tribute to David Bowie\\" tours each year) featured in a short 2004 promo film with Bowie himself, together promoting the new Bowie album \\"Reality\\". The late soul singer Charles Bradley had considerable success in his own right after starting his career as a James Brown tribute act. Not all tribute acts use the impersonation style. An example is The Muffin Men, who play the music of Frank Zappa in their own style, do not look like, or attempt to look like original members, and often tour with former band members. Jimmy Carl Black was a regular in the band, and they have in the past played, recorded, and toured with Ike Willis and Don Preston. \\"From the Jam\\" regularly play compositions by Paul Weller and the Jam featuring bassist Bruce Foxton and previously Rick Buckler. Despite being seen as a tribute act even with an original member, they have recorded original material at Weller's studios. Tribute acts are not always welcomed by the original acts they are patterned after. In April 2009, Bon Jovi sued the Los Angeles-based all-female tribute Blonde Jovi for copyright infringement. After temporarily using the name Blonde Jersey, the band reverted to Blonde Jovi before disbanding in February 2010. In 2012 the first ever television show dedicated to tribute bands called The Tribute Show made its debut on Australian cable channel Aurora Community Channel (channel 183) on Foxtel in Australia. The show is still currently on air. In 2013 through 2017, a television series titled The World's Greatest Tribute Bands appeared on American cable television network AXS TV. From tribute to the genuine article There have been several instances where members of a tribute band have been called up to join the actual band they were paying tribute to, or a related band that features members of that band, after a current member dies or leaves the group. This is often seen as a great way for bands to carry on since tribute band members have usually studied their part and can closely replicate the musical parts of the original artists. Some examples include: *Lead singer Rob Halford left Judas Priest in 1992 and was replaced by Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens from the tribute band British Steel in 1996. This was the first publicised example of a tribute performer joining the band they were paying tribute to and was the inspiration for the 2001 film Rock Star. Owens eventually left Judas Priest in 2003 when Halford rejoined the band. *Tommy Thayer, who once played with the Kiss cover band Cold Gin as Ace Frehley, became Frehley's replacement in Kiss in 2002. Prior to these events, Thayer had worked with Kiss as a songwriter on their 1989 album Hot in the Shade and a session guitarist on the 1998 album Psycho Circus, and had assisted Frehley in re-learning his guitar parts to old Kiss songs for a reunion tour after the latter's long long hiatus from the band. *When original drummer for The Jam Rick Buckler formed the band The Gift in 2006, which performed Jam material, guitarist Russell Hastings joined on guitar. Hastings had been a member of a Jam tribute band. Later that year original Jam bassist Bruce Foxton joined the band as well and they changed their name to From The Jam. Even though Buckler has left, Hastings still performs in the band with Foxton. *In 2007 Journey's then lead singer Jeff Scott Soto left the band. They approached Jeremey Hunsicker of the Journey tribute band Frontiers and had him audition for the group. While he did not ultimately end up performing or formally recording with the band, he did rehearse with them and got a songwriting credit on their album Revelation. *When singer Jon Anderson was unable to rejoin progressive rock band Yes in 2008 due to health problems, Beno√Æt David replaced him after bassist Chris Squire discovered a video of him performing with a Yes tribute band called Close to the Edge.Hard Rock Hideout ‚Äì Yes to Tour With Replacement Singer David left the band in 2012 and was replaced by Jon Davison, who was with the Yes tribute band Roundabout. *In 2009, original Grateful Dead members Bob Weir and Phil Lesh formed the band Furthur, whose repertoire consists primarily of Grateful Dead songs. They selected guitarist John Kadlecik from the renowned Dead tribute band Dark Star Orchestra to play the parts of the late Jerry Garcia. Since Furthur's breakup in 2014 Kadlecik has occasionally performed with Phil Lesh & Friends. *In 2010 singer Dave Brock joined Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger of The Doors in their reformation project Manzarek- Krieger. Brock had performed in The Doors cover band Wild Child for over 20 years. Manzarek-Krieger ceased to exist in 2013 following the death of Ray Manzarek.

Issues with ease of use, robustness, and security of the company's software are common targets for critics. In the 2000s, a number of malware mishaps targeted security flaws in Windows and other products. Microsoft was also accused of locking vendors and consumers in to their products, and of not following or complying with existing standards in its software. Total cost of ownership comparisons between Linux and Microsoft Windows are a continuous point of debate. The company has been the subject of numerous lawsuits, brought by several governments and by other companies, for unlawful monopolistic practices. In 2004, the European Union found Microsoft guilty in the Microsoft Corp. v. Commission case, and it received an 899 million euro fine.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement ties  On September 14, 2019, Microsoft's flagship store was shut down by protestors as part of a direct action organized by Close the Camps NYC. The action was in response to Microsoft's $19.4 million contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Microsoft's relationship with the immigration enforcement agency was revealed by executive Tom Keane, through a company blog post that describes ICE's use of the company's high-security cloud storage product Azure Government. He went on to say the company is \\"proud to support\\" the work of ICE. Microsoft has stated it \\"is not working with the U.S. government on any projects related to separating children from their families at the border.\\" Military ties In February 2019, some of Microsoft employees protested the company's war profiteering from a $480 million contract to develop augmented reality headsets for the United States Army.  Vendor lock-in  From its inception, Microsoft defined itself as a platform company and understood the importance of attracting third-party programmers. It did so by providing development tools, training, access to proprietary APIs in early versions, and partner programs. Although the resulting ubiquity of Microsoft software allows a user to benefit from network effects, critics and even Microsoft itself decry what they consider to be an \\"embrace, extend and extinguish\\" strategy of adding proprietary features to open standards or their software implementations, thereby using its market dominance to gain unofficial ownership of standards \\"extended\\" in this way. Microsoft software is also presented as a \\"safe\\" choice for IT managers purchasing software systems. In an internal memo for senior management Microsoft's head of C++ development, Aaron Contorer, stated: More recently, Microsoft had their OOXML specification approved by the ISO standards body in a manner consistent with previous attempts to control standards. With the release of Windows 8, Microsoft began requiring OEM devices to ship with UEFI system firmware, configured by default to only allow the execution of operating system binaries digitally signed by Microsoft (UEFI secure boot). Concerns were raised that this requirement would hinder the use of alternate operating systems such as Linux. In a post discussing secure boot on the Building Windows 8 blog, Microsoft developer Tony Mangefeste indicated that vendors would provide means to customize secure boot, stating that \\"At the end of the day, the customer is in control of their PC. Microsoft's philosophy is to provide customers with the best experience first, and allow them to make decisions themselves.\\" As such, vendors were required to provide means for users to re-configure or disable secure boot (although devices running Windows RT, a variation of Windows 8 for ARM architecture, have locked firmware where this cannot be disabled). No mandate is made regarding the installation of third-party certificates that would enable running alternative programs.  Copyright enforcement  When Microsoft discovered that its first product, Altair BASIC, was subject to widespread unauthorized copying, Microsoft founder Bill Gates wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists that openly accused many hobbyists of stealing software. Gates' letter provoked many responses, with some hobbyists objecting to the broad accusation, and others supporting the principle of compensation. This disagreement over whether software should be proprietary continues into the present day under the banner of the free software movement, with Microsoft characterizing free software released under the terms of the GPL as being \\"potentially viral\\" and the GNU General Public License itself as a \\"viral license\\" which \\"infects\\" proprietary software and forces its developer to have to release proprietary source to the public. The Halloween documents, internal Microsoft memos which were leaked to the open source community beginning in 1998, indicate that some Microsoft employees perceive \\"open source\\" software ‚Äî in particular, Linux ‚Äî as a growing long-term threat to Microsoft's position in the software industry. The Halloween documents acknowledged that parts of Linux are superior to the versions of Microsoft Windows available at the time, and outlined a strategy of \\"de-commoditize[ing] protocols & applications.\\" Microsoft stated in its 2006 Annual Report that it was a defendant in at least 35 patent infringement lawsuits. The company's litigation expenses for April 2004 through March 2007 exceed $4.3 billion: over $4 billion in payouts, plus $300 million in legal fees. Another concern of critics is that Microsoft may be using the distribution of shared source software to harvest names of developers who have been exposed to Microsoft code, as some believe that these developers could someday be the target of lawsuits if they were ever to participate in the development of competing products. This issue is addressed in published papers from several organizations including the American Bar Association and the Open Source Initiative. Starting in the 1990s, Microsoft was accused of maintaining \\"hidden\\" or \\"secret\\" APIs: interfaces to its operating system software that it deliberately keeps undocumented to gain a competitive advantage in its application software products. (public comment on US v. Microsoft under the Tunney Act) Microsoft employees have consistently denied this; they claim that application developers inside and outside Microsoft routinely reverse-engineered DOS and 16-bit versions of Windows without any inside help, creating legacy support problems that far exceeded any alleged benefit to Microsoft. In response to court orders, Microsoft has published interfaces between components of its operating system software, including components like Internet Explorer, Active Directory, and Windows Media that sell as part of Windows but compete with application software. On October 10, 2018, Microsoft joined the Open Invention Network community despite holding more than 60,000 patents.  Ignoring unauthorized copying  Microsoft ignored unauthorized copying of its own software for their benefit on the long term. While talking about users in China who don't pay for the software they use in 2006, to an audience at the University of Washington, Bill Gates said ‚ÄúAnd as long as they‚Äôre going to steal it, we want them to steal ours. They‚Äôll get sort of addicted, and then we‚Äôll somehow figure out how to collect sometime in the next decade.‚Äù The practice allowed Microsoft to gain some dominance over the Chinese market and only then taking measures against unauthorized copies. In 2008, by means of the Windows update mechanism, a verification program called ‚ÄúWindows Genuine Advantage‚Äù (WGA) was downloaded and installed. When WGA detects that the copy of Windows is not genuine, it periodically turns the user's screen black. This behavior angered users and generated complaints in China with a lawyer stating that \\"Microsoft uses its monopoly to bundle its updates with the validation programs and forces its users to verify the genuineness of their software\\".  Licensing agreements  A common complaint comes from those who want to purchase a computer that usually comes preinstalled with Windows without a copy of Windows pre-installed and without paying extra for the license either so that another operating system can be used or because a license was already acquired elsewhere, such as through the MSDN Academic Alliance program. Microsoft encourages original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to supply computers with Windows pre-installed by presenting their dominance in computer sales and arguing that consumers benefit by not having to install an operating system. Because the price of the license varies depending on discounts given to the OEM and because there is no similar computer that the OEM offers without Windows, there is no immediate way to find the size of the refund. In 2009, Microsoft stated that it has always charged OEMs about $50 for a Windows license on a $1,000 computer. While it is possible to obtain a computer with no or free operating systems, virtually all large computer vendors continue to bundle Microsoft Windows with the majority of the personal computers in their ranges. The claimed increase in the price of a computer resulting from the inclusion of a Windows license has been called the \\"Windows tax\\" or \\"Microsoft tax\\" by opposing computer users. The Findings of Fact in the United States Microsoft antitrust case of 1998 established that \\"One of the ways Microsoft combats piracy is by advising OEMs that they will be charged a higher price for Windows unless they drastically limit the number of PCs that they sell without an operating system pre-installed. In 1998, all major OEMs agreed to this restriction.\\" Microsoft also once assessed license fees based on the number of computers an OEM sold, regardless of whether a Windows license was included; Microsoft was forced to end this practice due to a consent decree. In 2010, Microsoft stated that its agreements with OEMs to distribute Windows are nonexclusive, and OEMs are free to distribute computers with a different operating system or without any operating system. Microsoft does not provide refunds for Windows licenses sold through an OEM, including licenses that come with the purchase of a computer or are pre-installed on a computer. According to Microsoft's End User License Agreement for Windows 7 the ability to receive a refund for the operating system is determined by the hardware manufacturer: Acer Inc. has a policy of requiring the customer to return items at his or her own expense, and the balance received by the customer can be as low as ‚Ç¨30. In other cases, vendors have asked that customers requesting refunds sign non- disclosure agreements. Older versions of Microsoft Windows had different license terms with respect to the availability of a refund for Windows: Based on the updated language, vendors refused to issue partial refunds for Windows licenses, requiring that the computer be returned altogether. In some countries, this practice has been ruled a violation of consumer protection law. Additionally, the EULA for Windows Vista was criticized for being too restrictive.  Litigation  Microsoft's market dominance and business practices have attracted widespread resentment, which is not necessarily restricted to the company's competitors. In a 2003 publication, Dan Geer argued the prevalence of Microsoft products has resulted in a monoculture which is dangerously easy for viruses to exploit.  Labor practices  The entrance to Microsoft Redmond campus in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft has been criticized for the use of permatemp employees (employees employed for years as \\"temporary,\\" and therefore without medical benefits), use of forced retention tactics, where departing employees would be sued to prevent departure, as well as more traditional cost-saving measures, ranging from cutting medical benefits to not providing towels in company locker rooms. Historically, Microsoft has also been accused of overworking employees, in many cases, leading to burnout within just a few years of joining the company. The company is often referred to as a \\"Velvet Sweatshop\\", a term which originated in a 1989 Seattle Times article, and later became used to describe the company by some of Microsoft's own employees. This characterization is derived from the perception that Microsoft provides nearly everything for its employees in a convenient place, but in turn overworks them to a point where it would be bad for their (possibly long-term) health. For example, the kitchenettes have free beverages and many buildings include exercise rooms and showers. However, the company has been accused of attempting to keep employees at the company for unreasonably long hours and working them too much. This is detailed in several books about Microsoft, including Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire. A US state lawsuit was brought against Microsoft in 1992 representing 8,558 current and former employees that had been classified as \\"temporary\\" and \\"freelance\\", and became known as Vizcaino v. Microsoft. In 1993, the suit became a US Federal Class Action in the United States District Court Western District Of Washington At Seattle as No. C93-178C. The Final Settlement came in 2005. The case was decided on the (IRS- defined) basis that such \\"permatemps\\" had their jobs defined by Microsoft, worked alongside regular employees doing the same work, and worked for long terms. After a series of court setbacks including three reversals on appeal, Microsoft settled the suit for US$97 million. A side effect of the \\"permatemp\\" lawsuit is that now contract employees are prevented from participating in team morale events and other activities that could be construed as making them \\"employees\\". They are also limited to 18-month contracts and must leave after that time for 6 months before returning under contract. Microsoft is the largest American corporate user of H-1B guest worker visas and has joined other large technology companies like Google in recently lobbying for looser H-1B visa restrictions. Jesse Jackson believes Microsoft should hire more minorities and women. Jackson has urged other companies to diversify their workforce. He believes that Microsoft made some progress when it appointed two women to its board of directors in 2015.  Advertising and public relations  Critics have alleged that Microsoft has used funding to drum up support from think tanks and trade organizations such as the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution (AdTI), the Independent Institute, and Americans for Technology Leadership (ATL). During the antitrust case United States v. Microsoft, ATL sent a poll to 19 state attorneys general purporting to show that \\"the public believes state AGs should devote their energy to causes other than Microsoft\\". Also during the case the Independent Institute ran full-page advertisements in The New York Times and The Washington Post defending Microsoft, which was later revealed to have funded the ad campaign. The institute published Winners, Losers, and Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology shortly thereafter. In June 2002, the AdTI published a report, quickly pulled under the argument that it was a draft version, which contained criticism of the copyleft model and the GNU General Public License. A May 2002 press release for the report stated that it would contain arguments suggesting that governments could be threatened by hackers and terrorists (who could study potential vulnerabilities due to source availability) if it used open source software. However, the draft contained no references to these topics. Open Source Initiative (OSI) founder Bruce Perens felt that the report had \\"Microsoft's paws all over [it]\\". Microsoft argued that its funding was for AdTI's operations as a whole, and not relevant to any specific research by the organization. \\"Champagne\\", a 2002 British television advert for the Xbox, received 136 complaints from viewers to the Independent Television Commission (ITC) over its content. The advert featured a newborn baby being launched out of its mother‚Äîaging as it flies through the air, and crashing into a gravestone. It contained the tagline \\"Life is short, play more.\\" The advert was banned from television by the ITC, who considered it to be \\"offensive, shocking and in bad taste\\", noting complaints citing the advert's themes of death and the \\"traumatic experience\\" the person was facing in the ad. In August 2004, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ordered Microsoft to pull ads in Britain that claimed that the total cost of ownership of Linux servers was ten times that of Windows Server 2003. The comparison included the cost of hardware, and put Linux at a disadvantage by installing it on more expensive but poorer-performing hardware compared to that used for Windows. On January 22, 2007, Rick Jelliffe made a claim on his blog that a Microsoft employee offered to pay him to make corrections in English Wikipedia articles concerning Office Open XML. Microsoft spokesperson Catherine Brooker expressed the belief that the article had been \\"heavily written\\" by IBM employees who supported the rival OpenDocument format, though she provided no specific evidence. Internet entrepreneur and Wikimedia Foundation founder Jimmy Wales described Microsoft's offer as unethical. In 2009, it was found that a photo on the Polish version of Microsoft's business productivity website‚Äîwhich depicted three people of various races during an office meeting‚Äîhad been edited to replace the head of an African-American man with that of a Caucasian, whilst also failing to edit the person's hand to match the different skin color. Microsoft apologized and quickly removed the image. In 2011, Moneylife.in alleged that two \\"anonymous comments boosting their product\\"‚Äîone by a Nokia employee and another by a Microsoft employee‚Äîwere posted on their review of Nokia Lumia 800, which was based only on the \\"technical specifications\\" and the reviewer \\"hadn't laid a finger on the phone\\". In conclusion, Charles Arthur argued \\"Nobody has come out of the episode looking good. Sapkale was accused of breaking his own site's privacy policy by posting the IP and email addresses of the commenters, while the commenting duo's failure to declare any interest looked, at best, like astroturfing.\\" In 2014 details on a partnership between Machinima.com and Microsoft came to light regarding a marketing campaign for Xbox One. Machinima would offer some of its users $3 per thousand views if the user showed 30 seconds of an Xbox One game and mentioned the system by name. Controversy arose when it was reported that, under the terms of the promotion, participants were not allowed to disclose that they were being paid for said endorsements, which Ars Technica said conflicted with FTC regulations requiring recipients to fully disclose when such actions occur. Machinima stated that the confidentiality clause only applied to the terms of the agreement, and not to the existence of the agreement, and Microsoft ended the promotion and directed Machinima to add disclosures to the videos involved. In September 2015, Machinima settled with the FTC over charges that the ad campaign failed to comply with FTC endorsement guidelines; the FTC decided not to take action against Microsoft since it already has \\"policies and procedures designed to prevent such lapses\\".  Blacklisting of journalists  John C. Dvorak said that in the 1980s, Microsoft classified journalists as \\"Okay\\", \\"Sketchy\\", or \\"Needs work\\" and targeted \\"Needs work\\" journalists in an attempt to have them terminated. Dvorak said that he was denied information about Windows because he was on a blacklist. Mary Jo Foley stated that she was denied interviews with Microsoft personnel for several years following the publication of a story based on a memo describing the number of bugs in Windows 2000 at release.Mary Jo Foley: The Exit Interview - Robert McLaws: Windows Vista Edition  Censorship in China  Microsoft (along with Google, Yahoo, Cisco, AOL, Skype, and other companies) has cooperated with the Chinese government in implementing a system of Internet censorship. Human rights advocates such as Human Rights Watch and media groups such as Reporters Without Borders criticized the companies, noting for example that it is \\"ironic that companies whose existence depends on freedom of information and expression have taken on the role of censor.\\"  Privacy issues   Collaboration with the NSA on internet surveillance  Microsoft was the first company to participate in the PRISM surveillance program, according to leaked NSA documents obtained by The Guardian and The Washington Post in June 2013, and acknowledged by government officials following the leak. The program authorizes the government to secretly access data of non-US citizens hosted by American companies without a warrant. Microsoft has denied participation in such a program. In July 2013, The Guardian elaborated that leaked documents show that: * Microsoft helped the NSA to circumvent its encryption to intercept web chats on Outlook.com and gave it unencrypted access to Outlook.com and Hotmail email. * Microsoft provided the NSA with access to users' data on its cloud storage service OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive). * After Microsoft bought Skype, the NSA tripled the number of Skype video calls being collected through PRISM. In a statement, Microsoft said that they \\"provide customer data only in response to legal processes.\\"  Telemetry and data collection  Windows 10 was criticized on-launch for having default settings that send various information regarding user behaviors to Microsoft and its \\"trusted partners\\", such as data regarding user contacts and calendar events (to optimize text and speech input), location data and history, \\"telemetry\\" (diagnostics data that is used by Microsoft to help service and optimize the operating system; this could not be fully disabled on non-enterprise versions of Windows 10), an \\"advertising ID\\", as well as further data when the Cortana assistant is enabled in full. Microsoft faced criticism from France's data protection commission and the European Union for its practices in regards to Windows 10. On subsequent iterations of the OS, Microsoft has clarified its data collection policies, and made its out-of-box experience provide clearer information on Windows privacy settings, and the effects they have on the overall user experience. Microsoft also simplified its \\"telemetry\\" options to only consist of \\"Basic\\" and \\"Full\\" modes, and reduced the amount of system information collected in \\"Basic\\" mode. In November 2018, the Dutch government issued a report stating that telemetry implementations in Office 365 violated the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In July 2019 the company tasked with investigating the privacy risks reported that Microsoft had adequately addressed these issues in Office 365 ProPlus, while the other concerns still remained. Robot Journalism In May 2020, Microsoft announced that a number of its MSN contract journalists would be replaced by robot journalism leading to criticism about which stories would be displayed and their quality.  Xbox Live prohibition on use of the word \\"gay\\"  Microsoft has come under some criticism for its attitude to homosexuality and Xbox Live. Users may not use the string \\"gay\\" in a gamertag (even in a non-homosexual context, for example as part of a surname), or refer to homosexuality in their profile (including self-identifying as such), as the company considers this \\"content of a sexual nature\\" or \\"offensive\\" to other users and therefore unsuitable for the service. After banning 'Teresa', a lesbian gamer who had been harassed by other users for being a homosexual, a senior Xbox Live team member, Stephen Toulouse, has clarified the policy, stating that \\"Expression of any sexual orientation [...] is not allowed in gamertags\\" but that they are \\"examining how we can provide it in a way that won't get misused\\".\\"Xbox LIVE policy and Gamertags/Profiles Redux\\" GLAAD weighed in on the controversy as well, supporting the steps that Microsoft has taken over the years to engage the LGBT community.

The ensuing scandal was one of the several causes of the fall of the Republican government and the polarization of the parliament, which finally led to the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939). Name The name had its origin in the names of the Dutch partners, one of whom was Daniel Strauss, but sources differ on the exact name or names of the others. Some sources say that there was just one other, called Jules Perel. Others state that there was a third female partner, Lowann, the wife of Strauss,Estraperlo in the Diccionario cr√≠tico etimol√≥gico de la lengua castellana, by Joan Corominas, pag. 445 (10), Francke-Bern, 1954. . but Paul Preston holds Perlowitz as the second partner. According to other sources, the name was in reference to the roulette machines (extra pearl). Scandal Rafael Salazar Alonso Partial view of the Kursaal Casino in San Sebasti√°n In 1934, Rafael Salazar Alonso was the conservative Minister of Interior in Spain. He was one of several prominent Radical Party figures to accept bribes in order to legalize the fixed roulette. He received a gold watch and 100,000 pesetas (¬£35,000 at present values).Preston, Paul (2013), 102 Other high-ranking officials in his Ministry also accepted them. Still, Salazar Alonso considered it too little, demanded more, and eventually arranged a police raid into the Grand Casino Kursaal of San Sebasti√°n on the inauguration day. To get back at him, the inventors leaked documents on the matter to President Niceto Alcal√°-Zamora.Preston, Paul (2013), 102 A complementary version notes that since they had invested a lot of money in the venture, they tried to recover it by blackmailing Prime Minister Alejandro Lerroux, whose nephew was involved in the scheme and influence peddling. Lerroux refused to get involved, and Strauss denounced the affair to President Alcal√°-Zamora, who made it public. The matter was debated at the Spanish Cortes in October 1935, which exonerated Salazar Alonso 140-137, with the help of CEDA. Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera went on to shout, \\"Long live the Straperlo!\\" However, the Radical Party was doomed and Salazar Alonso's reputation was over although he hung onto his position as mayor of Madrid.Preston, Paul (2013), 102 Consequences The reaction of the parties in the opposition caused the fall of Lerroux and his Radical Republican Party government. The new elections were won by the Popular Front and supported by the Spanish Communist Party, amid great instability. It ultimately resulted in the coup d'√©tat promulgated by General Francisco Franco's Nationalists in July 1936. Usage After the scandal, especially after the Spanish Civil War, the word was incorporated as \\"estraperlo\\" into the Spanish language with the meaning of any scheme which is illegal or corrupt, particularly smuggling.estraperlo in the Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa√±ola.

Sienkiewicz's work in the 1980s was considered revolutionary in mainstream US comics, due to his highly stylized art that verged on abstraction and made use of oil painting, photorealism, collage, mimeograph, and other forms generally uncommon in comic books. Early life Sienkiewicz was born May 3, 1958, in Blakely, Pennsylvania. When he was five years old, he moved with his family to the Hainesville, New Jersey section of Sandyston Township, New Jersey, where he attended elementary and secondary school. Sienkiewicz began drawing \\"when [he] was about four or five\\", and continued doing and learning about art throughout his childhood. His early comic book influences include artist Curt Swan Superman comics, and artist Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four. Sienkiewicz received his classical art education at the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Arts in Newark, New Jersey. After art school, he showed a portfolio of his work to DC Comics' art director Vince Colletta, which led to his entering the comics field at age 19. The artist recalled in 1985, \\"They didn't have any work for me, but that didn't bother me. I just figured that if comics didn't work out I'd have done advertising or illustration. Vinnie called [renowned comics and advertising artist] Neal Adams, who put me in touch with [Marvel Comics editor-in-chief] Jim Shooter. Soon after that I was drawing Moon Knight, in The Hulk [black-and-white comics] magazine\\". His early art style was heavily influenced by Neal Adams. Career Comics Sienkiewicz, drawing during a 1997 appearance in Gij√≥n, Spain Sienkiewicz continued as the artist of the Moon Knight color comics series, starting with the first issue (November 1980). His eclectic art style helped shed the early perception of Moon Knight as a mere Batman clone. Four years later, after a stint as artist on the Fantastic Four, he became the artist on Marvel's X-Men spin-off New Mutants, beginning with issue No. 18 (August 1984), producing cover paintings and character designs. From this period on, Sienkiewicz's art evolved into a much more expressionistic style, and he began experimenting with paint, collage, and mixed media. He illustrated New Mutants from 1984 to 1985. Sienkiewicz produced covers for a range of Marvel titles, including Rom, Dazzler, The Mighty Thor, Return of the Jedi and The Transformers, and drew the comic adaptation of Dune. Sienkiewicz's own first writing credit was for the painted story \\"Slow Dancer\\" in Epic Illustrated in 1986. Sienkiewicz both wrote and illustrated the 1988 miniseries Stray Toasters, an idiosyncratic work published by Epic Comics about a criminal psychologist investigating a series of murders. His first major interior work for DC Comics was contributing to Batman #400 (October 1986). He illustrated the 1986-87 eight-issue Elektra: Assassin limited seriesDeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 228: \\"Produced by Frank Miller and illustrated by Bill Sienkiewicz, Elektra: Assassin was an eight-issue limited series...published by Marvel's Epic Comics imprint.\\" and the Daredevil: Love and War graphic novel which were both written by Frank Miller. After this, he collaborated with writer Andy Helfer on the first six issues of DC Comics' The Shadow series. In 1988, he contributed to the Brought to Light graphic novel with writer Alan Moore. In 1990, Sienkiewicz and Moore published the first two issues of the uncompleted series Big Numbers. Sienkiewicz painted the Classics Illustrated adaptation of the novel Moby- Dick. Sienkiewicz was the subject of a 2008 full-length documentary/interview produced by Woodcrest Productions, The Creator Chronicles: Bill Sienkiewicz. In 2007, Sienkiewicz penciled 30 Days of Night: Beyond Barrow. In 2008, Sienkiewicz illustrated a story for The Nightmare Factory - Volume 2 graphic novel. That same year, he inked the Reign in Hell limited series for DC.Cowsill, Alan \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 334: \\"DC's version of Hell erupted into all-out war when the rulers of Purgatory, Blaze and Satanus invaded Neron's infernal domain. Written by Keith Giffen with art by Tom Derenick and Bill Sienkiewicz.\\" In 2010-2012, he inked several issues of Neal Adams' Batman: Odyssey project for DC Comics. In October 2012, Sienkiewicz teamed with fellow artists Klaus Janson and David W. Mack on the eight-issue Marvel mini-series Daredevil: End of Days. Regarding the contrast in art styles, Sienkiewicz related that it was deliberate, in order to \\"give a very definite break from the ‚Äúeveryday reality‚Äù that Klaus‚Äô art is meant to portray, as well as the impression of a flashback.\\" In June 2014, Sienkiewicz was the guest of honor at ceremony for the 2014 Inkwell Awards at HeroesCon in Charlotte, North Carolina. Other work In addition to his work in comics, Sienkiewicz has also worked in numerous other media, especially in the music and trading card industries. His artwork has been published in magazines including Entertainment Weekly and Spin. In 1998, he collaborated with writer Martin I. Green to produce the children's book Santa, My Life & Times. In 1989, Sienkiewicz painted the art for the Friendly Dictators card set published by Eclipse Comics which portrayed various foreign leaders such as Mobutu Sese Seko, Ferdinand Marcos, and Anastasio Somoza Debayle. This card set was followed by Coup d'etat : the assassination of John F. Kennedy (1990), a 36 card set including his meticulously detailed and stylized imagery of Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald, and Marylin Monroe. Sienkiewicz has illustrated cards for the Magic: The Gathering collectible card game. In 2004, Sienkiewicz contributed to card art for VS System, a collectible card game published by Upper Deck Entertainment. In 1995, he illustrated Voodoo Child: The Illustrated Legend of Jimi Hendrix the biography of Jimi Hendrix by Martin I. Green. In 1996, he provided the artwork for the Bruce Cockburn album The Charity of Night. Additional Sienkiewicz album covers include RZA's Bobby Digital in Stereo (1998), EPMD's Business as Usual (1990), and Kid Cudi‚Äôs Man on the Moon: The End of Day (2009). Also in 2006, Sienkiewicz teamed with Neal Adams to create art for former Pink Floyd bassist Roger Waters. Their artwork was utilized as video projections for live performances of Waters' song \\"Leaving Beirut\\". Sienkiewicz has worked on character design for animation. His work on the television series Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego? received two Emmy Award nominations in 1995 and 1996. In 2006, Sienkiewicz designed the layout and art for The Venture Bros. season one DVD set. He designed the cover art for the season three DVD and Blu-ray set.

Unfortunately, this only happened years later, after the name phpAdsNew was too well established to be changed. During the time period between 2001 and 2002, Wim Godden led the phpAdsNew project and later received help from developers such as Niels Leenheer and Phil Hord, continually adding new features and improving the existing ones. After the release of version 1.9, a completely revised version 2.0 was created. This task was led by Niels Leenheer. The new version included many new features as well as a revised graphical user interface. After gaining in popularity and earning support from the open-source community, the project was renamed to OpenAds. Features that were built for phpAdsNew 2.0 were also integrated into the latest OpenAds software, which at this point had reached version 2.3. When version 2.4.4 was released in 2007, OpenAds was once again rebranded under a new name: OpenX. The final 2.4 version is v2.4.11 and was released in March 2009. In 2011, the OpenX company disabled direct downloads of the software (a form must be filled out). Wim Godden subsequently made all GPL versions from phpAds 1.2.0 to OpenX 2.8.11 available.http://www.opensource.be/openx/ Revive Adserver can be extended with help of plug-ins.

George W. Cass, circa 1875  Family  George Washington Cass was born near Dresden, Ohio, March 12, 1810, to George W. and Sophia (Lord) Cass. He married Louisa Dawson in 1842.  Education  Cass attended Detroit Academy, 1824 to 1827, in Detroit, Michigan, while living with his uncle Lewis Cass, governor, Michigan Territory. He then graduated from U.S. Military Academy, West Point, New York, class of 1832.  Career  Cass joined United States Army Corps of Engineers circa 1832, working on improvements to the Cumberland Road. Cass helped design the first cast iron bridge in the United States at Brownsville, Pennsylvania, later designated a National Civil Engineering Landmark. Cass left the Army as a first lieutenant in 1836 and settled into private business in Brownsville, Pennsylvania. From 1836 to 1855 Cass organized steamboat and stagecoach lines. Due to his efforts, he was appointed president of Adams & Co., predecessor to Adams Express. He expanded the Boston-based shipping company to points as far away as St. Louis, Missouri, and Richmond, Virginia. From Adams, Cass went into railroading, becoming president of the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad in 1856, and the successor Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad (PFW&C;) in 1857. He held the latter position until 1883. During this period the PFW&C; became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Cass joined the Northern Pacific Railway as a director in 1867, four years before the company laid its first rail near Carlton, Minnesota. He was appointed president in 1872, and saw the company through the difficult years following the failure of Jay Cooke and Company and the Panic of 1873. He remained as president until 1875, when the company succumbed to its first bankruptcy. Cass was named its receiver and remained until Frederick Billings reorganized the company circa 1878. He died March 21, 1888 in New York City. Legacy Cass County, North Dakota was named after him, as was the city of Casselton, North Dakota.

In the Bah√° º√≠ calendar, it begins at sunset on the 13th of Jal√°l, which translates to the 20th or 21st of April, depending on the date of the March equinox (exactly one month on the Gregorian calendar after the equinox). On the first, ninth and twelfth days of Ridv√°n, work and school should be suspended. \\"Ridv√°n\\" means paradise, and is named for the Garden of Ridv√°n outside Baghdad, where Bah√° ºu'll√°h stayed for twelve days after the Ottoman Empire exiled him from the city and before commencing his journey to Constantinople. It is the holiest Bah√° º√≠ festival, and is also referred to as the \\"Most Great Festival\\" and the \\"King of Festivals\\". History Context In 1844 Siyyid  ªAl√≠-Muhammad of Shiraz proclaimed that he was the \\"B√°b\\" (), after a Shi ªa religious concept. His followers were therefore known as B√°b√≠s. The B√°b's writings introduced the concept of \\"He whom God shall make manifest\\", a Messianic figure whose coming, according to Bah√° º√≠s, was announced in the scriptures of all of the world's great religions. Bah√° ºu'll√°h claimed that his mission as the Promised One of the B√°b, was revealed to Him in 1852 while imprisoned in the S√≠y√°h-Ch√°l in Tehran, Iran. After his release from the S√≠y√°h-Ch√°l, Bah√° ºu'll√°h was banished from Persia, and he settled in Baghdad, which became the centre of B√°b√≠ activity. Although he did not openly declare this prophetic mandate, he increasingly became the leader of the B√°b√≠ community. Bah√° ºu'll√°h's rising prominence in the city, and the revival of the Persian B√°b√≠ community, gained the attention of his enemies in Islamic clergy and the Persian government. They were eventually successful in having the Ottoman government summon Bah√° ºu'll√°h from Baghdad to Constantinople (present-day Istanbul). Najibiyyih garden Garden of Ridv√°n, Baghdad Before Bah√° ºu'll√°h left for Constantinople, many visitors came to visit him. To allow his family to prepare for the trip, and to be able to receive all these visitors, he decided to move to the Najibiyyih garden across the Tigris river from Baghdad. He entered the garden on 22 April 1863 (31 days after Naw R√∫z, which usually occurs on 21 March) accompanied by his sons  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, M√≠rz√° Mihd√≠ and M√≠rz√° Muhammad  ªAl√≠, his secretary Mirza Aqa Jan and some others, and stayed there for eleven days. After his arrival in the garden, Bah√° ºu'll√°h announced his mission and station for the first time to a small group of family and friends. The exact nature and details of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's declaration are unknown. Bah√≠yyih Kh√°num is reported to have said that Bah√° ºu'll√°h stated his claim to his son  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and four others. While some B√°b√≠s had come to the realization that Bah√° ºu'll√°h was claiming to be the Promised One through the many remarks and allusions that he had made during his final few months in Baghdad, it appears that most other B√°b√≠s were unaware of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's claim until a few years later while he was in Edirne. For the next eleven days Bah√° ºu'll√°h received visitors including the governor of Baghdad. Bah√° ºu'll√°h's family was not able to join Him until 30 April, the ninth day, since the river had risen and made travel to the garden difficult though lasting only nine days was a comparatively mild flooding of the river. On the twelfth day of their stay in the garden, Bah√° ºu'll√°h and his family left the garden and started on their journey to Constantinople. Festival In the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas, written during 1873, Bah√° ºu'll√°h ordains Ridv√°n as one of two \\"Most Great Festivals\\", along with the Declaration of the B√°b. He then specified the first, ninth, and twelfth days to be holy days; these days mark the days of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's arrival, the arrival of his family and their departure from the Ridv√°n garden, respectively. The Festival of Ridv√°n is observed according to the Bah√° º√≠ calendar, and begins on the thirty-second day of the Bah√° º√≠ year, which falls on 20 or 21 April. The festival properly starts at two hours before sunset on that day, which symbolises the time that Bah√° ºu'll√°h entered the garden. On the first, ninth, and twelfth days, which are Bah√° º√≠ Holy Days, work is prohibited. Currently, the three holy days are usually observed with a community gathering where prayers are shared, followed with a celebration. Significance The time that Bah√° ºu'll√°h spent at the Garden of Ridv√°n in April 1863, and the associated festival and celebration, has a very large significance for Bah√° º√≠s. Bah√° ºu'll√°h calls it one of two \\"Most Great Festivals\\" and describes the first day as \\"the Day of supreme felicity\\" and he then describes the Garden of Ridvan as \\"the Spot from which He shed upon the whole of creation the splendours of his Name, the All-Merciful\\". The festival is significant because of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's private declaration to a few followers that he was \\"Him Whom God shall make manifest\\" and a Manifestation of God, and thus it forms the beginning point of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, as distinct from the Babi religion. It is also significant because Bah√° ºu'll√°h left his house in Baghdad, which he designated the \\"Most Great House\\", to enter the Garden of Ridv√°n. Bah√° ºu'll√°h compares this move from the Most Great House to the Garden of Ridv√°n to Muhammad's travel from Mecca to Medina. Furthermore, during Bah√° ºu'll√°h's first day in the garden, he made three further announcements: (1) abrogating religious war, which was permitted under certain conditions in Islam and the B√°b√≠ faith; (2) that there would not be another Manifestation of God for another 1,000 years; and (3) that all the names of God were fully manifest in all things. These statements appear in a text written some years after 1863, which has been included in the compilation Days of Remembrance (section 9). Nader Saiedi states that these three principles are \\"affirmed, expounded, and institutionalized\\" in Bah√° ºu'll√°h's Kitab-i-Aqdas, which was completed in 1873. Related texts Throughout his life, Bah√° ºu'll√°h wrote several tablets and prayers on the occasion of Ridv√°n, among which are the following. * H√∫r-i- ªUj√°b (Tablet of the Wondrous Maiden) * Lawh-i- ª√Åshiq va Ma ªsh√∫q (Tablet of the Lover and the Beloved) * S√∫riy-i-Qalam (S√∫rih of the Pen) These and several others are published in the volume titled Days of Remembrance Bah√° º√≠ elections The Ridv√°n period is also the time when Bah√° º√≠ elections for the local and national Spiritual Assemblies take place every year, as well as the election of the Universal House of Justice, every five years. Ridv√°n messages Annually, during Ridv√°n, the Universal House of Justice sends a 'Ridv√°n message' to the worldwide Bah√° º√≠ community, which generally looks back on the previous year, and provides further guidance for the coming year.All Ridv√°n messages can be found at Bahai.org and Bahaiprayers.net/Ridvan (multi-lingual).

In a depraved-heart murder, defendants commit an act even though they know their act runs an unusually high risk of causing death or serious bodily harm to a person. If the risk of death or bodily harm is great enough, ignoring it demonstrates a \\"depraved indifference\\" to human life and the resulting death is considered to have been committed with malice aforethought.Commonwealth v. Malone, 354 Pa. 180, 47 A.2d 445 (1946). In some states, depraved-heart killings constitute second-degree murder,Bonnie, R.J. et al. Criminal Law, Second Edition. Foundation Press, New York, NYL 2004, p. 797 while in others, the act would be charged with \\"wanton murder,\\" varying degrees of manslaughter, or third-degree murder. If no death results, such an act would generally constitute reckless endangerment (sometimes known as \\"culpable negligence\\") and possibly other crimes, such as assault. Common law background > It [\\"depraved heart\\" murder] is the form [of murder] that establishes that > the wilful doing of a dangerous and reckless act with wanton indifference to > the consequences and perils involved is just as blameworthy, and just as > worthy of punishment, when the harmful result ensues as is the express > intent to kill itself.

The common law treats such a state of mind as just as > blameworthy, just as anti-social and, therefore, just as truly murderous as > the specific intents to kill and to harm.Robinson v. State, 307 Md. 738, 517 > A.2d 94 (1986), quoting DeBettencourt v. State, 48 Md. App. 522, 530, 428 > A.2d 479, 484 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1981) The common law punishes unintentional homicide as murder if the defendant commits an act of gross recklessness. A classic example of depraved-heart murder under the common law is in the case Commonwealth v. Malone, a Pennsylvania case in which the court affirmed the second-degree murder conviction of a teenager for a death arising from a game of modified Russian roulette in which each player pointed and fired the gun at the other, eventually resulting in the death of one of them. Under the Model Penal Code Depraved-heart murder is recognized in the Model Penal Code ¬ß 210.2(1)(b).American Law Institute Model Penal Code (Official Draft, 1962) The Model Penal Code considers unintentional killing to constitute murder when the conduct of the defendant manifests \\"extreme indifference to the value of human life\\". International equivalents Canada The Canadian Criminal Code categorises murder as first- and second-degree for sentencing purposes. However, the Supreme Court held that murder requires, at minimum, subjective knowledge that death is a likely consequence of the defendant's actions.R v Martineau, [1990] 2 SCR 633. Mere recklessness, no matter how extreme, is not sufficient to burden the defendant with the stigma of being labeled a murderer. The circumstances that give rise to depraved-heart second-degree murder in the US only constitute manslaughter in Canada. England and Wales Murder is not classified into degrees, unlike in Canada, but sentences are more severe in cases where there are more aggravating than mitigating factors. The guidelines start with the recommended sentence for murder being 12 years if the offender is under 18 (see Starting points for murder). An offender 18 years of age or older, will receive a minimum non- parole period of 15 years. Penalties increase when at least one aggravating factor (as defined in the Criminal Justice Act) can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. In cases involving multiple murders, a second (multiple) murder conviction(s), or the murder of a police officer, then the detention term can be the prisoner's whole life. In English criminal law, however, murder requires intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. Recklessness as to harm will not suffice. In a case where death results from recklessness, the defendant will be guilty of reckless manslaughter. Germany A similar concept is :de:Eventualvorsatz, also called dolus eventualis or bedingter Vorsatz (literally: ‚Äúconditional intent‚Äù). Under this concept, a court can treat the result of a criminal act as intentional if the defendant did not explicitly intend this result, but realized it was likely and knowingly accepted this risk. While Eventualvorsatz can apply to any crime, it is usually only applied in cases involving bodily harm or murder. Typical cases where courts recognized Eventualvorsatz (in this case for murder) include setting fire to an inhabited house and reckless speeding in an urban area. Well-known cases  1946 Russian roulette case  In the 1946 case, Commonwealth v. Malone, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the conviction of a teenager on the charge of second degree murder using the depraved-heart doctrine. The teenager in question had set up a game of Russian roulette which ended in the death of another teenager, a friend of the defendant. When tried for the crime of murder, his defense argued that since he had no intent to kill, the defendant could not be convicted of murder. The prosecution successfully argued using the depraved-heart doctrine that his recklessness and carelessness amounted to a level of negligence sufficient to serve as evidence of criminally culpable intent.

It is situated in the Kalmar Strait, between the mainland province of Sm√•land and the island province of √ñland. Administratively, the uninhabited island is part of the municipality of Oskarshamn and covers an area of approximately with a mean height above sea level of . Home to black guillemots and a Swedish National Park since 1926, freedom to roam at Bl√• Jungfrun is limited with visitors prohibited from staying overnight on the island or making fires. The island consists partly of bare rock with the remainder covered in dense hardwood forest. There are several caves and an ancient stone labyrinth from which it is forbidden to remove stones. Geologically the island is an ancient inselberg rising from the Sub-Cambrian peneplain. After its formation in the Precambrian time Bl√• Jungfrun was buried in sandstone being shielded for erosion. It was freed from its sandstone cover in geologically recent times.  Legends  Detail of the stone labyrinth on Bl√• Jungfrun. The island plays an important role in Swedish folklore, where it is viewed as an evil and magical place. The name Bl√• Jungfrun was originally used by sailors to avoid provoking the evil spirits who dwelt on the island. According to a widespread belief, related already by Olaus Magnus in 1555, witches meet there each Maundy Thursday. Carl Linnaeus, who visited the island in 1741, was sceptical: Women and fairy-tales ... generally say that all witches will go here (truly a rather difficult journey) each Maundy Thursday; but those who have visited the place once are not likely to return, and should find out the reason for the fable: If any place in the world looks hideous, this is surely one of the most cruel. The many water polished stones on the beaches of Bl√• Jungfrun are illegal to remove from the island because of its national park status. And according to tradition, anyone who steals a stone from the island will suffer from bad luck until it is returned. The town of Oskarshamn yearly receives stones from former Bl√• Jungfrun visitors, often with an accompanying letter describing misfortunes and disasters which happened to the letter writers after removing them. In May 2004, over 160 such stones were publicly brought back to the island on a ferry from Oskarshamn.\\"Curse of the Stones\\", Fortean Times #219, February 2007, pp 44-48 Modern traditions A girl dressed up as an Easter witch In Sweden and Swedish-speaking parts of Finland, to commemorate the travel of witches to :sv:Bl√•kulla or according to some traditions Bl√• Jungfrun, children dress as witches, old women and old men on Easter and go door-to-door for treats similar to the trick-or-treating tradition of halloween.

Park establishment and tourism  Between 1904 and 1925 the red granite of Bl√• Jungfrun was extracted in three quarries on the south of the island. It was exported chiefly to Germany as decorative stone. The destruction led to efforts to protect the island. A donation from the Swedish entrepreneur Torsten Kreuger made it possible to acquire the island and stop the quarrying.

The strategy-stealing argument applies to any symmetric game (one in which either player has the same set of available moves with the same results, so that the first player can \\"use\\" the second player's strategy) in which an extra move can never be a disadvantage. The argument works by obtaining a contradiction. A winning strategy is assumed to exist for the second player, who is using it. But then, roughly speaking, after making their first move ‚Äì which by the conditions above is not a disadvantage ‚Äì the first player may then also play according to this winning strategy. The result is that both players are guaranteed to win ‚Äì which is absurd, thus contradicting the assumption that such a strategy exists. Strategy-stealing was invented by John Nash in the 1940s to show that the game of hex is always a first-player win, as ties are not possible in this game.. However, Nash did not publish this method, and credits its first publication to Alfred W. Hales and Robert I. Jewett, in the 1963 paper on tic-tac-toe in which they also proved the Hales‚ÄìJewett theorem.. Other examples of games to which the argument applies include the m,n,k-games such as gomoku. In the game of Sylver coinage, strategy stealing has been used to show that the first player wins, rather than that the game ends in a tie.  Example  A strategy-stealing argument can be used on the example of the game of tic-tac- toe, for a board and winning rows of any size. Suppose that the second player is using a strategy, S, which guarantees them a win. The first player places an X in an arbitrary position, and the second player then responds by placing an O according to S. But if they ignore the first random X that they placed, the first player finds themselves in the same situation that the second player faced on their first move; a single enemy piece on the board. The first player may therefore make their moves according to S ‚Äì that is, unless S calls for another X to be placed where the ignored X is already placed. But in this case, the player may simply place his X in some other random position on the board, the net effect of which will be that one X is in the position demanded by S, while another is in a random position, and becomes the new ignored piece, leaving the situation as before. Continuing in this way, S is, by hypothesis, guaranteed to produce a winning position (with an additional ignored X of no consequence). But then the second player has lost ‚Äì contradicting the supposition that they had a guaranteed winning strategy. Such a winning strategy for the second player, therefore, does not exist, and tic-tac-toe is either a forced win for the first player or a tie. Further analysis shows it is in fact a tie. The same proof holds for any strong positional game.  Chess  There is a class of chess positions called Zugzwang in which the player obligated to move would prefer to \\"pass\\" if this were allowed. Because of this, the strategy-stealing argument cannot be applied to chess.. See in particular Section 22.2.2.2, The Strategy-Stealing Argument, p. 376. It is not currently known whether White or Black can force a win with optimal play, or if both players can force a draw. However, virtually all students of chess consider White's first move to be an advantage and statistics from modern high-level games have White's winning percentage about 10% higher than Black's.  Go  In Go passing is allowed. When the starting position is symmetrical (empty board, neither player has any points), this means that the first player could steal the second player's winning strategy simply by giving up the first move. Since the 1930s, however, the second player is typically awarded some compensation points, which makes the starting position asymmetrical, and the strategy-stealing argument will no longer work. An elementary strategy in the game is \\"mirror go\\", where the second player performs moves which are diagonally opposite those of this opponent. This approach may be defeated using ladder tactics, ko fights, or successfully competing for control of the board's central point.  Constructivity  The strategy-stealing argument shows that the second player cannot win, by means of deriving a contradiction from any hypothetical winning strategy for the second player. The argument is commonly employed in games where there can be no draw, by means of the law of the excluded middle. However, it does not provide an explicit strategy for the first player, and because of this it has been called non-constructive. This raises the question of how to actually compute a winning strategy. For games with a finite number of reachable positions, such as chomp, a winning strategy can be found by exhaustive search.

This compound is a white crystalline solid which dissolves in water to give free hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide - urea contains solid and water-free hydrogen peroxide, which offers a higher stability and better controllability than liquid hydrogen peroxide when used as an oxidizing agent. Often called carbamide peroxide in the dental office, it is used as a source of hydrogen peroxide for bleaching, disinfection, and oxidation.  Production  For the preparation of the complex, urea is dissolved in 30% hydrogen peroxide (molar ratio 2:3) at temperatures below 60 ¬∞C. upon cooling this solution, hydrogen peroxide - urea precipitates in the form of small platelets. Determination of the hydrogen peroxide content by titration with potassium permanganate solution gives a value of 35.4% which corresponds to 97.8% of the theoretical maximum value. The remaining impurity consists of urea. Akin to water of crystallization, hydrogen peroxide cocrystallizes with urea with the stoichiometry of 1:1. The compound is simply produced (on a scale of several hundred tonnes a year) by the dissolution of urea in excess concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution, followed by crystallization. The laboratory synthesis is analogous. Structure and properties The solid state structure of this adduct has been determined by neutron diffraction. Hydrogen peroxide-urea is a readily water-soluble, odorless, crystalline solid, which is available as white powder or colorless needles or platelets. Upon dissolving in various solvents, the 1:1 complex dissociates back to urea and hydrogen peroxide. So just like hydrogen peroxide, the (erroneously) so- called adduct is an oxidizer but the release at room temperature in the presence of catalysts proceeds in a controlled manner, thus the compound is suitable as a safe substitute for the unstable aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide. Because of the tendency for thermal decomposition, which accelerates at temperatures above 82 ¬∞C, it should not be heated above 60 ¬∞C, particularly in pure form. The solubility of commercial samples varies from 0.05 g/mLSigma- Aldrich specification sheet to more than 0.6 g/mL.Chemicalland data sheet Applications Disinfectant and bleaching agent Hydrogen peroxide - urea is mainly used as a disinfecting and bleaching agent in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. As a drug, this compound is used in some preparations for the whitening of teeth.Toothwhitening from the UMD of New Jersey website It is also used to relieve minor inflammation of gums, oral mucosal surfaces and lips including canker sores and dental irritation,Center for Integrative Medicine: Carbamide Peroxide from the University of Maryland Medical Center website and to emulsify and disperse earwax. Carbamide peroxide is also suitable as a disinfectant, e.g. for germ reduction on contact lens surfaces or as an antiseptic for mouthwashes, ear drops or for superficial wounds and ulcers. Reagent in organic synthesis In the laboratory, it is used as a more easily handled replacement for hydrogen peroxide.Harry Heaney, Francesca Cardona, Andrea Goti, \\"Hydrogen Peroxide‚ÄìUrea\\" Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis 2008. It has proven to be a stable, easy-to-handle and effective oxidizing agent which is readily controllable by a suitable choice of the reaction conditions. It delivers oxidation products in an environmentally friendly manner and often in high yields especially in the presence of organic catalysts such as cis-butenedioic anhydride or inorganic catalysts such as sodium tungstate. Reaktionen mit Carbamidperoxid It converts thiols selectively to disulfides, secondary alcohols to ketones, sulfides to sulfoxides and sulfones, nitriles to amides, N-heterocycles to amine oxides. Reaktionen von Methoxyphenolen mit UHP Hydroxybenzaldehyde are converted to dihydroxybenzenes (Dakin reaction) and gives under suitable conditions the corresponding benzoic acids. Baeyer-Villiger-Oxidation mit UHP It oxidizes ketones to esters, in particular cyclic ketones, such as substituted cyclohexanones or cyclobutanones to give lactones (Baeyer-Villiger oxidation). The epoxidation of various alkenes in the presence of benzonitrile yields oxiranes in yields of 79 to 96%. Epoxidierung von Cyclohexen mit UHP The oxygen atom transferred to the alkene originates from the peroxoimide acid formed intermediately from benzonitrile. The resulting imidic acid tautomerizes to the benzamide.  Safety  The compound acts as a strong oxidizing agent and can cause skin irritation and severe eye damage.

Established as a Lutheran seminary in 1861 by Norwegian immigrants, the school today is an institution of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.http://www.luther.edu/ir/assets/luther_college_enrollments__2009_2013__20130917__CENSUS_.pdf History On October 10, 1857, the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church (NELC) created a seminary to supply ministers for Norwegian congregations in the Upper Midwest. Until the seminary was established in 1861, students studied at Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri. On October 14, 1859, the Rev. Peter Laurentius Larsen was appointed professor to the Norwegian students at Concordia by the NELC. Upon the closing of the seminary in April 1861, at the start of the Civil War, the NELC decided to open its own college that fall in a former parsonage at Halfway Creek, Wisconsin, just north of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and close to present day Holmen, Wisconsin. On September 1, 1861, classes officially began with an enrollment of 16. The following year classes moved to Decorah, Iowa, with NELC Pastor Ulrik Vilhelm Koren successfully arranging the college's relocation and permanent settlement. In 1866, a group of students signed a \\"bill of rights\\" criticizing the rigid schedule, the rules about going downtown, the lack of windows in some of the sleeping rooms, and the woodcutting and shoe-shining chores, concluding that \\"there was not enough freedom.\\" The leader of the group, 18-year-old Rasmus Anderson, was expelled. This event was viewed as a rebellion and \\"the worst of sins\\" by the pastors assembled in a pastoral conference shortly after. Campus House, built in 1867, is the oldest building on campus. Originally a parsonage for Nils O. Brandt (1824-1921), pastor of the campus, it was soon purchased by the College. In 1905, Dr. Carlo A. Sperati, an 1888 graduate of Luther, became the music director of the college and developed the Luther College Concert Band, founded in 1878, on the model of the wind ensemble pioneered by John Philip Sousa. Under Sperati, the band undertook several tours of Europe, their first in 1914, earning international acclaim for their musical talent. Sperati remained on the faculty until his death in 1945. In 1932, Luther College dropped its mandatory study of the classics and embraced the modern concept of the liberal arts education. Due to financial constraints associated with the Great Depression, the college decided to admit women as students in 1936. During the 1960s Luther constructed several new campus buildings and adopted a 4-1-4 semester schedule. Luther's current Main Building is the third to stand in the same location; fire destroyed the previous two. In 1964, Luther's museum collection became separate from the college and was established as the Norwegian-American Museum. Now known as Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum, it is the largest and most comprehensive museum in the United States devoted to a single immigrant group. Nordic Fest, started in 1967, grew from Luther College Women's Club's annual celebration of Norwegian Constitution Day. Campus Luther lies at the edge of Decorah, a small town situated in the hilly driftless region of the Upper Midwest. The Upper Iowa River flows through the lower portion of the nearly central campus. The college owns an adjoining devoted to environmental research, biological studies, and recreation. Luther student housing includes residence halls (Miller Hall, Dieseth Hall, Ylvisaker Hall, Farwell Hall, Brandt Hall, Larsen Hall, Olson Hall) and several houses, townhouses, and apartment buildings. Ninety-five percent of Luther students live on campus all four years. Koren building, one of the oldest on campus, houses Luther's social sciences departments. In the 2000s, the college engaged in extensive building projects. A renovation of residence halls and the Dahl Centennial Union was completed in 2006, and Sampson Hoffland Laboratories, an extension of Valders Hall of Science, was completed in 2008. The Center for Faith and Life is Luther's largest and primary performing arts facility. Academics Luther is an exclusively undergraduate institution, enrolling 2,337 students and employing 177 full- time faculty in 2015-16.http://www.luther.edu/ir/assets/IPEDS_profile_Luther_2012_13.pdf The college is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. It is a member institution of the Associated Colleges of the Midwest and the Annapolis Group. Among liberal arts colleges, Luther was ranked 90th by the 2016 edition of U.S. News and World Report. Luther enrolled 624 first-year students for the entering class of 2015. Thirty-one percent of first-year students were in the top 10 percent of their high school class, the average high school grade point average was 3.7, and the interquartile range for ACT scores was 23-29. Tuition and fees are shown as $40,040 for 2016-17,url=http://www.luther.edu/financialaid/tuition/ with 98 percent of students receiving need- and/or merit-based financial aid. Music Luther College campus Luther has a number of music organizations that tour and sell recordings internationally. The Nordic Choir, Concert Band, Symphony Orchestra and Jazz Orchestra are the college's four internationally touring ensembles, which have performed in many of the major concert halls and music centers of Europe, as well as Russia, China, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, and the Caribbean. About 40 percent of the students participate in at least one of the college's six choirs, three concert bands, three string orchestras, and two jazz ensembles. \\"Christmas at Luther,\\" Luther's annual Christmas concert, is broadcast nationwide each year. The concert broadcast is updated annually, with a current stream of the concert each December. Much of Luther's musical heritage can be largely attributed to the influence of two long-serving individuals. The 40-year tenure of Dr. Carlo A. Sperati, Class of 1888, fostered the college's Lutheran musical tradition beginning in 1905 and developed the Luther College Concert Band into one of the first nationally touring music ensembles. Sperati's Concert Band quickly achieved national acclaim, and famed bandmaster John Philip Sousa canceled a performance of his own touring ensemble just so that he could attend a performance of the Luther College Concert Band, which was scheduled to appear in a nearby city. Sperati's foundation was built upon by Weston Noble '43, himself a student of Sperati. Following three years of U.S. Army enlistment in World War II, Noble returned to his alma mater to conduct the Concert Band and the Nordic Choir, direct Christmastime performances of George Frederic Handel's Messiah, and teach in the Music Department. Noble's bands (which he conducted until 1973) and choirs completed coast-to-coast tours and international appearances. Ensembles under his direction performed solo concerts at such venues as Lincoln Center and Town Hall in New York; the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC; the Mormon Tabernacle in Salt Lake City; Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles; Orchestra Hall at Symphony Center in Chicago; Orchestra Hall and the State Theatre in Minneapolis; and the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts in Saint Paul. Under Noble's direction, Luther ensembles also appeared at historic cathedrals and concert halls throughout Europe, Russia, and Scandinavia, as well as on the programs of many national conventions of the American Bandmasters Association, the American Choral Directors Association, and the Music Educators National Conference. The Nordic Choir was featured in the film The Joy of Bach, and in four weekly international broadcasts of The Hour of Power from the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, California. Weston Noble retired from the faculty at the close of the academic year in 2005, having served continuously for 57 years, from 1948 to 2005. A new film documentary \\"To This Day\\" about the first international tour of the Nordic Choir in 1967 was released in October 2017. The Sampson Hoffland Laboratories expanded Valders Hall of Science. The Nordic Choir, which tours internationally, is one of the five choral ensembles at Luther. Collegiate Chorale is a mixed choir composed of juniors and seniors. Cathedral Choir is a mixed choir that draws exclusively from the sophomore class. Aurora and Norskkor, featuring soprano-alto and tenor-bass voices, respectively, are composed entirely of first-year students. In addition to the five choirs, students have opportunities with Collegium Musicum and Vocal Jazz Ensemble. Collegium Musicum is an early music ensemble specializing in the music of the medieval, Renaissance, and baroque periods. The ensemble focuses more on instrumental works, but incorporates vocal music throughout the academic year. The ensemble is open to singers of all years at Luther. The Vocal Jazz Ensemble is open to all students and often performs jointly with Luther's instrumental jazz ensembles. Symphony Orchestra, Jazz Orchestra, and Concert Band also tour internationally. Symphony Orchestra establishes residency in Vienna every four years, and Jazz Orchestra has toured in the Caribbean and Brazil. Concert Band travels to Japan and China following spring semester every four years. Other instrumental ensembles include Chamber Orchestra, Philharmonia, Jazz Band, Varsity Band, Brass Ensemble, and Wind and Percussion Ensemble. Currently, Joan deAlbuquerque conducts the Concert Band, and Andrew Last has succeeded Allen Hightower and Craig Arnold (who succeeded Weston Noble) as director of choral activities and conductor of Nordic Choir. Daniel Baldwin conducts the Luther College Symphony Orchestra, and Juan-Tony Guzm√°n directs Jazz Orchestra. Luther students also participate in faculty- coached student chamber ensembles ranging from piano trios to a full flute choir. Some of these ensembles include the Luther Ringers student handbell choir; the 40+ member Trombone Choir; five student-led, small-group a cappella ensembles; the Luther College Balalaika ensemble; and the student-led Luther Gospel Choir. In 1996, musician Dave Matthews appeared in concert with Tim Reynolds at Luther College in the Center for Faith and Life, which resulted in their 1999 album Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds Live at Luther College. In 2002, the Empire Brass, with college organist William Kuhlman, appeared in concert and recorded an album, Baroque Music for Brass and Organ, in the Center for Faith and Life. In 2008, musician Ben Folds appeared for his second time in concert at Luther College in the Center for Faith and Life. Study abroad Each year, between 400 and 500 Luther students expand their worldviews through international study, ranking Luther among the top baccalaureate colleges in the nation for the percentage of students who study abroad prior to graduation‚Äîover two-thirds. Over the years, more than 150 Luther faculty have led Luther students on programs in more than 70 countries. Athletics The Luther Norse have been a member of the Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (commonly called the Iowa Conference or IIAC) since its founding in 1922. Luther competes in 10 men's and nine women's intercollegiate athletic programs. Since joining the Iowa Conference, Luther has won 237 IIAC titles. Three hundred thirty-eight All-American honors have been earned by Luther student-athletes, and twenty-nine athletes have been crowned national champions. Sixty-eight student-athletes have been awarded the CoSIDA Academic All-American honor, and forty-two have received the distinguished NCAA Postgraduate Scholarship. Since 1993-94, the first year of the award, 1,929 academic all-conference honors have been earned by Luther student-athletes. To earn academic all-conference honors, a student-athlete must have a grade point average of 3.50 or greater on a 4.0 scale, have attended the school for a full year, and have competed in a varsity sport. About 20 percent of Luther students participate in one of the 19 varsity sports offered. Forty-five percent of students participate in the school's intramural sports program, which ranges from sand volleyball to Wii bowling. Outdoor Recreational Services is an extension of the Recreational Services program in which students/staff lead outdoor activities such as slacklining and kayak trips on the Upper Iowa River and fall break trips rock climbing and whitewater rafting.

He was a supporter of dictator Rafael Trujillo, and was also rumored to be a political assassin under his regime. Rubirosa made his mark as an international playboy for his jetsetting lifestyle and his legendary sexual prowess with women. His five spouses included two of the richest women in the world. Early life Porfirio Rubirosa Ariza was born in San Francisco de Macor√≠s, Dominican Republic, the third and youngest child of an upper-middle-class family. His parents were Pedro Mar√≠a Rubirosa and Ana Ariza Alm√°nzar. The eldest child was named Ana and the elder son was named C√©sar. His father, also a womanizer, was at one time a \\"general\\" of a group of heavily armed men in the mountainous Cibao region working with the government.Levy (2005), p. 6f Don Pedro advanced to become a diplomat, and after a stint at St. Thomas was made Chief of the Dominican Embassy to Paris in 1915.Levy (2005), p. 16 Rubirosa thus grew up in Paris, France and returned to the Dominican Republic at the age of 17 to study law. But he soon changed course and enlisted in the military. Diplomat In 1931, Rubirosa met Rafael Trujillo at a country club. Trujillo asked to see him the next morning, and made him a lieutenant of his Presidential Guard.Levy (2005), p. 37 Their relationship lasted throughout their lives, went up and down, mostly close, but not without episodes of danger for Rubirosa, and defined his professional career when he became a diplomat of the Dominican Republic in 1936. In this role, he was sent to embassies, first at Berlin (during the 1936 Olympic Games) and soon to Paris, where he spent most of his time; he also served at the embassies at Vichy, Buenos Aires, Rome, Havana (witnessing the Cuban Revolution), and Brussels. He was a frequent visitor to New York, Washington, Florida, and California. Rubirosa, who defined himself a Trujillista, moved freely among the rich and famous, made the connections, and kept the secrets. His 1938 divorce of Trujillo's daughter seemed, at least on the surface, to have little influence over his erstwhile father-in-law's affection for, or trust in, him. However, at times, when his escapades stirred up too much notoriety, Trujillo would dismiss him - as from his post in Paris in 1953 - or move him to another place. Trujillo recognized what an asset Rubirosa was for his regime, remarking: \\"He is good at his job, because women like him and he is a wonderful liar.\\"Levy (2005), p. 160 After Trujillo's assassination on May 30, 1961, Rubirosa supported his son as successor and attempted to persuade John F. Kennedy to help his government. When Ramfis Trujillo and his family fled the Dominican Republic, Rubirosa's career came to an end. On January 2, 1962, the Council of State removed him from his unique appointment as \\"Inspector of Embassies\\".Levy (2005), p. 294f After he lost his diplomatic immunity, he was questioned by the New York District Attorney concerning the disappearance of Trujillo opponents Sergio Bencosme in 1935 and Jesus Gal√≠ndez in 1956, but was never charged. Personal life Rubirosa was linked romantically to Dolores del R√≠o, Eartha Kitt, Marilyn Monroe, Ava Gardner, Maria Montez, Rita Hayworth, Dorothy Dandridge, Lupe V√©lez, Soraya Esfandiary, Peggy Hopkins Joyce, Joan Crawford, Veronica Lake, Kim Novak, Judy Garland, and Eva Peron. He dallied with his ex-wife Flor de Oro Trujillo Ledesma during his marriage to Doris Duke. He and Zsa Zsa Gabor were seen together during her marriage to George Sanders. When she would not marry him, despite the fact George was divorcing her, Rubi married Barbara Hutton. He was named a co- respondent in George Sanders' divorce suit from Gabor. Rubirosa was married five times, but never had any children. His wives were: * Flor de Oro Trujillo, Rafael Trujillo's eldest daughter, December 3, 1932‚Äì1938 * Danielle Darrieux, French actress, September 18, 1942 ‚Äì May 21, 1947 * Doris Duke, American heiress, September 1, 1947 ‚Äì October 1948; with marital gifts and final settlement he received an alimony ($25,000 per year until remarriage), a fishing fleet off Africa, several sports cars, a converted B-25 bomber (La Ganza), and a 17th-century house in Rue de Bellechasse, Paris.Levy (2005), p. 143, 154f * Barbara Hutton, American heiress, December 30, 1953 ‚Äì February 20, 1954; in the settlement he received a coffee plantation in the Dominican Republic, another B-25, polo ponies, jewelry, and a reported $2.5 million.Levy (2005), p. 214 * Odile Rodin, French actress, October 27, 1956 ‚Äì July 5, 1965 (his death). His playboy lifestyle was matched by stories of his sexual prowess. His reputedly larger than average penis size inspired Parisian waiters at Maxim's to name gigantic pepper mills \\"Rubirosas\\". The name stuck and has been in use all over the world. Polo and car racing After World War II, Rubirosa became engaged in two major passions, polo and car racing, both expensive sports that would be supported in years to come by his wives. He organized and led his own polo team Cibao-La Pampa that was an often successful contender for the Coupe de France. Rubirosa played polo until the end of his life. In the same period, he started to acquire fast cars and form friendships with racing car drivers. He would own a number of Ferraris. His first race at 24 Hours of Le Mans took place in June 1950 with his partner Pierre Leygonie, and his second race, this time with Innocente Baggio, was four years later; in both races his car did not finish. Rubirosa participated in a number of races at Sebring, all but once as a private entry.Levy (2005), p. 150ff Rubirosa entered one Formula One race, in 1955, the Grand Prix de Bordeaux on April 25. He planned to drive his own Ferrari 500, identical to the one which brought Alberto Ascari the and Drivers' World Championship. However, he fell ill before the race and did not drive. Death Rubirosa died in the early morning of July 5, 1965, at the age of 56, when he crashed his silver Ferrari 250 GT cabriolet into a horse chestnut tree in the Bois de Boulogne after an all-night celebration at the Paris nightclub \\"Jimmy's\\" in honor of winning the polo Coupe de France.

Life prior to Abu Ghraib  Steven Stefanowicz grew up in the suburban Philadelphia town of Telford, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Souderton Area High School in 1988. He was a center on the boys' basketball team, and a class leader. He graduated with a B.S. from the University of Maryland in 1995. He moved to Australia in 1999 following his Australian then-girlfriend Joanna Buttfield. A naval reservist, following the September 11 attacks, he sought full-time deployment with the Navy in 2002. He left the Navy in September 2003 and found employment with CACI.  Activity related to Abu Ghraib  Stefanowicz was \\"a contract interrogator for the 205th Intelligence Brigade.\\" He was known in the prison by the nickname \\"Big Steve\\". It has been alleged that he ordered and oversaw abusive interrogations which some have labelled as torture. According to the New York Times, \\"In mid-August, a team of civilian interrogators led by Steven Stephanowicz, a former Navy petty officer and an employee of a Virginia company called CACI International, began work at Abu Ghraib under a classified one-year military contract. ... Their job was to conduct interrogations in conjunction with military police and military intelligence units, according to a company memorandum.\\" In the report by Major General Antonio M. Taguba regarding the alleged acts of brutality, abuse, and torture at the Enemy Prisoner of War facility at Abu Ghraib and other Enemy Prisoner of War Camps in Iraq and Afghanistan, Taguba said, \\"'Specifically I suspect that Col. Thomas M. Pappas, Lt. Col. Steve L. Jordan, Mr. Steven Stephanowicz and Mr. John Israel were either directly or indirectly responsible for the abuses at Abu Ghraib and strongly recommend immediate disciplinary actions ...\\" In an interview with a military investigator, Col. Thomas Poppas described Stefanowicz as \\"out of control\\" in his commission of abuses. Poppas claims to have spoken to his superiors about this multiple times. Taguba said that Stefanowicz \\"should be given an official reprimand, have [his security clearance] reviewed, and, in the case of Stephanowicz, have his security clearance revoked and his employment as a civilian contractor terminated.\\" However, the online diary of another CACI interrogator at Abu Ghraib, Joe Ryan, reveals that a \\"Steve Stefanowicz\\" was still working at the prison on April 26, 2004, suggesting that Taguba's conclusions were ignored until the prison abuse scandal broke in the media.  Alleged abuses  According to testimony given by military policeman Pvt. Ivan Frederick II at the court-martial of Sgt. Michael J. Smith, Stefanowicz ordered the use of unmuzzled dogs to scare prisoners. The Fay Report finds this allegation \\"highly plausible\\". \\"In an interview with Army investigators on April 6 and 7, 2005, Cpl. Charles Graner accused Stefanowicz of leading abuse...Under Stefanowicz's direction, according to Graner, prisoners could be put on sleep plans: 20 hours awake, four hours of rest. They could be put in stress positions. They could be sexually humiliated.\\" Stefanowicz allegedly ordered women's underwear put on a prisoner's head, and tying that same prisoner's hands above his head to a window until the prisoner passed out. It is also alleged that Stefanowicz ordered a prisoner apparently suffering from appendicitis not be given his prescribed pain medication.  Credibility of abuse allegations  Stefanowicz and his attorney denied these allegations, and claimed that Stefanowicz had even attempted to address a case of suspected abuse. General Taguba considers Stefanowicz's denials false, saying he \\"made a false statement to the investigating team regarding the locations of his interrogations, the activities of his interrogations and his knowledge of abuses.\\" Taguba's report further states, \\"He also allowed and possibility instructed MPs who had no knowledge of interrogation techniques to facilitate the activities by setting conditions which he 'clearly knew his instructions equated to physical abuse'\\". Army Chief Warrant Officer John D. Graham ‚Äì an interrogation operations officer at Abu Ghraib ‚Äì supports Stefanowicz and says Stefanowicz expressed concern of the treatment of prisoners and took the issue of mistreatment to superiors.  Legal repercussions  Stefanowicz has not been criminally prosecuted based on the allegations. A court martial is not possible because Stefanowicz was a civilian. Standard criminal prosecution may not be possible due to legalities surrounding private military contractors in Iraq, including the fact that the CACI contract was with the Department of the Interior. On July 30, 2004 the Al Rawi v. Titan Corporation class-action civil suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California naming Stefanowicz as a defendant. On May 5, 2008, Stefanowicz was named as a defendant in the civil suit \\"Emad Khudhayir Shahuth Al-Janabi v. Steven A.

The species is subdivided into multiple subspecies, including Pararge aegeria aegeria, Pararge aegeria tircis, Pararge aegeria oblita, and Pararge aegeria insula. The color of this butterfly varies between subspecies. The existence of these subspecies is due to variation in morphology down a gradient corresponding to a geographic cline. The background of the wings ranges from brown to orange, and the spots are either pale yellow, white, cream, or a tawny orange. The speckled wood feeds on a variety of grass species. The males of this species exhibit two types of mate locating behaviors: territorial defense and patrolling. The proportion of males exhibiting these two strategies changes based on ecological conditions. The monandrous female must choose which type of male can help her reproduce successfully. Her decision is heavily influenced by environmental conditions. Taxonomy The speckled wood belongs to the genus Pararge, which comprises three species: Pararge aegeria, Pararge xiphia, and Pararge xiphioides. Pararge xiphia occurs on the Atlantic island of Madeira. Pararge xiphioides occurs on the Canary Islands. Molecular studies suggest that the African and Madeiran populations are closely related and distinct from European populations of both subspecies, suggesting that Madeira was colonized from Africa and that the African population has a long history of isolation from European populations. Furthermore, the species Pararge aegeria comprises four subspecies: Pararge aegeria aegeria, Pararge aegeria tircis, Pararge aegeria oblita, and Pararge aegeria insula. These subspecies stem from the fact that the speckled wood butterfly exhibits a cline across their range. This butterfly varies morphologically down the 700 km cline, resulting in the different subspecies corresponding to geographical areas. Description The average wingspan of both males and females is , although males tend to be slightly smaller than females. Furthermore, males possess a row of grayish-brown scent scales on their forewings that is absent in the females. Females have brighter and more distinct markings than males. The subspecies P. a. tircis is brown with pale yellow or cream spots and darker upperwing eyespots. The subspecies P. a. aegeria has a more orange background and the hindwing underside eyespots are reddish brown rather than black or dark gray. The two forms gradually intergrade into each other. Subspecies P. a. oblita is a darker brown, often approaching black with white rather than cream spots. The underside of its hindwings has a marginal pale purple band and a row of conspicuous white spots. The spots of subspecies P. a. insula are a tawny orange rather than a cream color. The underside of the forewings has patches of pale orange, and the underside of the hindwing has a purple-tinged band. Although there is considerable variation with each subspecies, identification of the different subspecies is manageable.

The northern butterflies in this species have a bigger size, adult body mass, and wing area. These measurements decrease as one moves in a southerly direction in the speckled wood's range. Forewing length on the other hand increases moving in a northerly direction. This is due to the fact that in the cooler temperatures of the northern part of this butterfly's range, the butterflies need larger forewings for thermoregulation. Finally, the northern butterflies are darker than their southern counterpart, and there is a coloration gradient, down their geographical cline. Habitat and range The speckled wood occupies a diversity of grassy, flowery habitats in forest, meadow steppe, forest, woods, and glades. It can also be found in urban areas alongside hedges, in wooded urban parks, and occasionally in gardens. Within its range the speckled wood typically prefers damp areas. It is generally found in woodland areas throughout much of the Palearctic realm. P. a. tircis is found in northern and central Europe, Asia Minor, Syria, Russia, and central Asia, and the P. a. aegeria is found in southwestern Europe and North Africa. Two additional subspecies are found within the British Isles: the Scottish speckled wood (P. a. oblita) is restricted to Scotland and its surrounding isles, and the Isles of Scilly speckled wood (P. a. insula) is found only on the Isles of Scilly. P. a. tricis and P. a. aegeria gradually intergrade into each other.

First instar (newly hatched) and fourth instar (fully grown) are shown next to a human finger for scale. Pupa The eggs are laid on a variety of grass host plants. The caterpillar is green with a short, forked tail, and the chrysalis (pupa) is green or dark brown. The species is able to overwinter in two totally separated developmental stages, as pupae or as half-grown larvae. This leads to a complicated pattern of several adult flights per year. Food sources Larval food plants include a variety of grass species such as Agropyron (Lebanon), Brachypodium (Palaearctic), Brachypodium sylvaticum (British Isles), Bromus, (Malta), Cynodon dactylon, (Spain), Dactylis glomerata (British Isles, Europe), Elymus repens, (Lebanon), Elytrigia repens (Spain), Holcus lanatus (British Isles), Hordeum (Malta), Melica nutans, (Finland), Melica uniflora (Europe), Oryzopsis miliacea (Spain), Poa annua (Lebanon), Poa nemoralis (Czechoslovakia), Poa trivialis (Czechoslovakia), but the preferred species of grass is the couch grass (Elytrigia repens). The adult is nectar feeding. Growth and development The growth and development of the speckled wood butterfly is dependent on the larval density and the sex of the individual. High larval densities result in decreased survivorship as well as a longer development and smaller adults. However, females are much more adversely affected by this phenomenon. They depend on their larval food stores during oviposition, so a high larval density in the larva stage can result in lower fecundity for females in the adult stage. Males can compensate for their smaller size by feeding as adults or switching mate-locating tactics, so they are less affected by high larval densities. A high growth rate can also negatively affect larval survivorship. Those with high growth rates will also have high weight-loss rates if food becomes scarce. They are less likely to survive if food becomes available once again. Mating behavior In the speckled wood butterfly females are monandrous; they typically only mate once within their lifetime. On the other hand, males are polygynous and typically mate multiple times. In order to locate females, males employ one of two strategies: territorial defense and patrolling. During territorial defense, the male defends a sunny spot in the forest, waiting for females to stop by. Another strategy is patrolling, during which males fly through the forest actively searching for females. Then, the female must make a choice between mating with a patrolling male or a territorial male. By mating with a territorial male, a female can be sure that she has chosen a high quality male, as the ability to defend a territory reflects the genetic quality of a male. Therefore, by choosing a territorial male, the female is being more picky about which male she chooses to mate with. The choice is most likely dependent on the search costs associated with finding a mate. When actively searching for a male, a female must spend her precious time and energy, which results in search costs, especially when she has a limited life span. As search costs increase, female choosiness for a mate decreases. For example, if a female's life span is shorter, she has a higher cost associated with searching for the ideal mate. Therefore, she is likely to mate within a day of her emergence as an adult, and will most likely mate with a patrolling male, as they are easier to find. However, if a female lifespan is longer, then the search costs associated with finding a mate are lower. The female is then more likely to actively search for a territorial male. Since the search costs vary depending on environmental conditions, strategies vary from population to population. Males employing different strategies, territorial defense or patrolling, can be differentiated by the number of spots on their hindwings. Those with three spots are more likely to be patrolling males, while those with four spots are more likely to be defending males. The frequency of the two phenotypes depends on the location and time of year. For example, there are more territorial males in areas where there are many sunny spots. Furthermore, the development of wingspots is influenced by environmental conditions. Therefore, the strategy employed by males is heavily dependent on environmental conditions. Territorial behavior Territorial defense involves a male flying or perching in a spot of sunlight that pierces through the forest canopy. The speckled wood butterfly spends the night high up in the trees, and territorial activity commences once sunlight passes through the canopy. The males often remain in the same sunspot until the evening, following the sunspot as it moves across the forest floor. The males often perch on vegetation near the forest floor. If a female flies into the territory, the resident male flies after her, the pair drops to the ground, and copulation follows. If another species flies through the sunspot, the resident male ignores the intruder. However, if a conspecific, a male of the same species, enters the sunspot, the resident male flies towards the intruder almost bumping into him, and the pair flies upwards. The winner flies back towards the forest floor within the sunspot, while the defeated male flies away from the territory. The pattern of flight during this encounter depends on the vegetation. In an open understory, the pair flies straight upwards. In a dense understory, this flight pattern is not possible, so the pair spirals upwards. In most of these interactions, the conflict is relatively short, and the resident male wins. The intruder most likely backs down as a serious confrontation could be costly, and there is an abundance of equally desirable sunspots. However, if both males believe they are the \\"resident\\" male, the conflict escalates. If a previous owner of the sunspot tries to reclaim his territory after he has left for mating, a longer and more costly fight ensues. In these serious fight, the winner of the contest is not predictable. The abundance of territorial behavior depends on the environmental conditions. At the beginning of the mating season, fights over ownership of a sunspot territory are lengthy. The duration of the conflict quickly decreases during a period of two weeks. This pattern is correlated with the progression of the season, as temperature and male density rise. Sunspots are more attractive when temperatures are low, as they provide the warmth needed for higher levels of activity. As male density increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to hold onto a territory, so territoriality decreases and more males exhibit patrolling behavior. Asymmetry and territoriality In butterflies, asymmetrical wings are observed in three different ways: fluctuating (small, random variations from the standard bilateral symmetry), directional (variations that are biased towards a particular side so one wing is larger than the other), and antisymmetry (similar to directional but half of the individuals of the species find that a particular wing, such as their left, is larger, and the other half of the individuals find that their right is larger. Both genders of the speckled wood butterfly exhibit asymmetrical wings; however, only males show directional asymmetry (likely to be caused by genetic factors). Also, females show more asymmetry in general compared to males. Within male speckled wood butterflies, the melanic form shows greater directional asymmetry and grows more slowly than the pale, territorial males. Furthermore, males that are most successful in territorial disputes are only slightly asymmetrical, as opposed to complete symmetry or asymmetry; this indicates that sexual selection affects asymmetry. Reproduction and offspring A female's fecundity is dependent on body mass, as females deprived from sucrose during their oviposition period have reduced fecundity. Therefore, heavier females will produce a larger number of eggs. In addition to body mass, the number of eggs laid by a female may also be related to the time spent searching for an oviposition site. The number of eggs laid is inversely proportional to egg size. However, egg size was not found to have any influence on egg or larval survival, larval development time, or pupal weight under experimental conditions. One explanation may be that there is a tradeoff between the number of eggs laid and the time spent searching for the optimal oviposition site. A female would produce more eggs in an optimal environment, so she can produce more offspring and increase her reproductive fitness. Paternal investment During copulation in butterfly species, the male deposits a spermatophore in the female consisting of sperm and a secretion high in proteins and lipids. The female uses the nutrients in the spermatophore in egg production. In a polyandrous mating system, where sperm competition is present, it is beneficial for males to deposit a large spermatophore in order to fertilize the largest amount of eggs possible and possibly prevent the female from mating again. Since most females in the speckled wood butterfly behave monandrously, there is decreased sperm competition, and the male's spermatophore is much smaller relative to other species. The speckled wood male's spermatophore size increases as body mass of the male increases. The spermatophore in the second copulation is significantly smaller, so copulation with a virgin male results in a higher number of larval offspring. Therefore, there is a cost to females associated with mating with a non-virgin male.

Lee Thompson. It is the fifth and final installment in the original Planet of the Apes series, produced by Arthur P. Jacobs, following Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. It stars Roddy McDowall, Claude Akins, Natalie Trundy, Severn Darden, Lew Ayres, Paul Williams, and John Huston. The second and third films in the 2010s reboot series, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) and War for the Planet of the Apes (2017), have a similar premise to Battle, but they are not officially remakes. Plot Told as a flashback to the early 21st century, with a wraparound sequence narrated by the orangutan Lawgiver in \\"North America ‚Äì 2670 A.D.\\", this sequel follows the ape leader Caesar years after a global nuclear war has destroyed civilization. Living with his wife, Lisa and their son, Cornelius, Caesar creates a new society while trying to cultivate peace between the apes and remaining humans. Caesar is opposed by a gorilla named Aldo, who wants to imprison the humans who freely roam Ape City while doing menial labor. After defusing followers of Aldo who attacked a human teacher for saying \\"No\\" to apes, Caesar ponders if his own parents could have taught him how to make things better. MacDonald, Caesar's human assistant and the younger brother of MacDonald (from Conquest of the Planet of the Apes) reveals to Caesar that his brother told him of archived footage of Cornelius and Zira within the underground, now radioactive ruins of what is known as the Forbidden City from the last film. Caesar travels with MacDonald and his orangutan advisor Virgil to the Forbidden City to find the archives. It is revealed that mutated and radiation-scarred humans are living within the city, under the command of Governor Kolp, the man who once captured Caesar. Caesar and his party view the recordings of his parents, learning about the future and Earth's eventual destruction before they are forced to flee when Kolp's soldiers attempt to kill them. Fearing the mutant humans may attack Ape City, Caesar reports his discoveries. When Caesar calls MacDonald and a select group of humans to the meeting, Aldo leads the gorillas away. Kolp's scouts find Ape City. Believing Caesar is planning to finish off all mutant humans, Kolp declares war on Ape City despite his assistant M√©ndez's attempt to get him to see reason. Aldo plots a coup d'√©tat in order for the gorillas to take control. Cornelius overhears from a nearby tree, but is critically wounded when Aldo spots him and hacks off the tree branch he is on with his sword. The next day, after a gorilla scouting pair are attacked by Kolp's men, Aldo takes advantage of a grieving Caesar's absence to have all humans corralled while looting the armory. Cornelius eventually dies from his wounds, leaving a devastated Caesar with the revelation that Cornelius was not hurt by humans. When Kolp's ragtag force launches their attack, Caesar orders the defenders to fall back. Finding Caesar lying among dozens of fallen apes, Kolp expresses his intention to personally kill him. The apes, however, are merely feigning death and launch a counterattack that captures most of the mutant humans. Kolp and his remaining forces try to escape, only to be slaughtered by Aldo's troops once they are out in the open. Aldo confronts Caesar about releasing the corralled local humans and orders the gorillas to kill them. When Caesar shields the humans and Aldo threatens him, Virgil (having learned the truth from MacDonald) reveals Aldo's role in Cornelius's death and that he broke their community's most sacred law ‚Äì \\"Ape shall never kill ape\\". An infuriated Caesar pursues Aldo up a large tree, their confrontation resulting in Aldo falling to his death. With Caesar realizing that apes are no different than their former human slaveowners, he agrees to MacDonald's request for humans to be treated as equals, co-existing in a new society. They store their guns in the armory; Caesar and Virgil reluctantly explain to the armory's overseer, an orangutan named Mandemas, that they will still need their weapons for future conflicts and can only wait for the day when they will no longer need them. The scene returns to the Lawgiver, saying it has now been over 600 years since Caesar's death. His audience is revealed to be a group of young humans and apes, the Lawgiver noting that their society still waits for a day when their world will no longer need weapons, while they \\"wait with hope\\". A closeup of a statue of Caesar shows a single tear falling from one eye. Cast Production Development Initially, writer Paul Dehn, who had provided the script for every previous sequel, was hired to provide a story treatment for the fifth film in the series. Dehn withdrew from the project prior to completing the screenplay due to health reasons. Screenwriters John William Corrington and Joyce Hooper Corrington were brought in after the success of their film The Omega Man, although prior to that, neither one of them had written any science fiction films. Joyce Carrington later admitted they had never seen any of the Apes films prior to being hired to write the script for Battle.Russo, Joe; Landsman, Larry and Gross, Edwards. Planet of the Apes Revisited. St. Martins' Griffin. August 2001. Dehn was unavailable for the initial rewrites, but was hired to come in and do a final polish on the script, making minor changes to the script that the Corringtons had written. Dehn was given a story credit despite an appeal to the Writer's Guild of America for shared credit on the screenplay. Dehn claimed to have rewritten 90% of the dialogue and he altered the ending. The original script by the Corringtons ended on a playground with ape and human children fighting. Dehn chose to go with a close up of a statue of Caesar with a tear falling from its eye which Joyce Corrington characterized as \\"...stupid. It turned our stomachs when we saw it.\\"Russo, Joe; Planet of the Apes Revisited. The Writer's Guild of America ruled in favor of the Corringtons for sole screenplay credit. Filming Principal photography took place on the Fox Movie Ranch for an estimated budget of $1.7 million. Heading into filming, director J. Lee Thompson was unhappy with both the script and the scope of the production, which he felt could have used a bigger budget to assist in the portrayal of Battle. Thompson had agreed to direct without a script in place and regretted that Paul Dehn could not have been on the project throughout the writing process. Battle for the Planet of the Apes was the second-to-last film produced by Arthur P. Jacobs. He died June 27, 1973 at age 51, less than two weeks after its release. Extended cut The syndicated television version adds a few scenes cut from the theatrical release. One scene takes place after Aldo chases teacher Abe, where MacDonald reminds him why humans should not say \\"no\\" to an ape. Another scene towards the end of the film shows the beginnings of the House of Mendez cult, as the humans in the city are about to fire off the doomsday bomb (as seen in Beneath the Planet of the Apes), but decide not to, as it would destroy the world. In Beneath, one can see many signs of Mendez in the Forbidden Zone, a hymnal on the pipe organ reading \\"Mendez II\\", busts of past leaders of the mutant society (such as Mendez XIV), and the mutant leader in Beneath is also named Mendez. It is clear that Governor Mendez is a different leader than his predecessors, Breck and Kolp, since he is more sympathetic to the apes, as long as they do not invade their territory. In 2006, the Planet of the Apes movies were re-released separately and in a new box set. This version was earlier released in a Japanese laserdisc boxset. Listed are the additional scenes: * Near the end of the opening credits, the score continues to its original ending for 25 seconds, with extra footage of General Aldo approaching Ape City on his horse. * The chase of the teacher of the apes is longer by 20 seconds. * The mutant chief is walking around in his HQ, and has more dialogue. * The entry into the ruins of the Forbidden City of the ape scout party with Caesar is 40 seconds longer, with more dialogue. * The escape from the Forbidden City shows more footage and dialogue involving the apes. * The scene where Cornelius is \\"shot\\" by a human boy begins slightly earlier, making it clear that the shooting is a game ‚Äì which makes more sense, since no mutant party had yet even approached Ape City. * DELETED SCENE: In this edited scene, Governor Kolp tells his lieutenant to fire an atomic missile on Ape City when he gives the signal. * The mutant assault is 45 seconds longer. In this sequence, there were three more smaller cuts that reduced the battle scene by 40 additional seconds, and originally there was no musical score. * The scene where Governor Kolp calls \\"Sergeant York\\" is missing. * There are additional shots and dialogue before the mutants lay down the smoke screen. * 355 more seconds of the battle were cut. * The scene where Aldo kills Governor Kolp and his followers in the school bus has been restored. * The fight between Aldo and Caesar is longer. * DELETED SCENE: Mendez has become the new governor and talks the mutant lieutenant out of firing the atomic missile. As they argue, they discover it is the Alpha-Omega bomb from Beneath the Planet of the Apes. Reception Battle for the Planet of the Apes grossed a domestic total of $8.8 million, making it the lowest-grossing film in the series. The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics. The film holds a 36% \\"Rotten\\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 28 critical reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars out of four, stating, \\"Battle looks like the last gasp of a dying series, a movie made simply to wring the dollars out of any remaining ape fans.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded one star out of four and wrote, \\"The fifth and last in the successful Apes series is the worst of the lot, a bloody bore.\\"Siskel, Gene (July 18, 1973). \\"Scream, Blacula\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 8. Variety noted, \\"This is the fifth and last feature film of the 'Apes' series, and the fact shows too obviously in the Arthur P. Jacobs production, which is routine programmer material for fast playoff ... J. Lee Thompson's perfunctory direction both reflects and sets the sluggish tone pervading the 86-minute film.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Battle For The Planet Of The Apes\\". Variety. May 23, 1973. 28. Vincent Canby of The New York Times opined that director J. Lee Thompson \\"will not win any awards for 'Battle,' but the film's simplicity defuses criticism. The chimpanzee and orangutan make-up remains remarkable, and the lines are occasionally bright and funny. There are far worse ways of wasting time.\\"Canby, Vincent (July 13, 1973). \\"Planet of Apes Goes Into Battle\\". The New York Times. 19. Tom Shales of The Washington Post wrote that the film \\"ends it all with more of a thud than a bang‚Äîprolonging the concept but, again, failing to extend the idea.\\"Shales, Tom (July 6, 1973). \\"Going 'Ape' Again\\". The Washington Post. B7. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote in a positive review that although the film \\"is launched from a more thinly contrived premise than any of its predecessors it becomes just as involving as they were, thanks to the strong appeal of the series' allegorical underpinnings and to the adroit direction of J. Lee Thompson, who stages several spectacular (rather than gory) battle scenes with the same finesse he displays in the film's more intimate moments.\\"Thomas, Kevin (June 12, 1973). \\"'Battle' Completes Ape Cycle\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 18. David McGillivray wrote that \\"almost every line of the Corringtons' thin script attests the strain of having to find anything new for the apes to say or do.\\" Legacy In the 2012 film Argo, based on the 1980 \\"Canadian Caper\\" rescue from Iran of U.S. diplomats hiding at the Canadian ambassador's residence, Tony Mendez gets the idea for the fictitious Argo cover story from watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes on television. This was a nod to the role of Planet of the Apes make-up artist John Chambers in the Canadian Caper.

Retrieved April 18, 2011 After a rescue mission in Earth orbit was depicted in the 1969 film Marooned, the company revived the concept in November 1970. Marshall Space Flight Center issued a formal Mission Requirements document on 17 May 1972, with subsequent revisions. Skylab 3 astronauts Alan Bean and Jack Lousma helped design the \\"field modification kit\\" to use a standard CSM for rescue, and would have flown the CSM for their mission to rescue Skylab 2 if necessary. The standard Skylab Command Module accommodated a crew of three with storage lockers on the aft bulkhead for resupply of experiment film and other equipment, as well as the return of exposed film, data tapes and experiment samples. To convert the standard CSM to a rescue vehicle, the storage lockers were removed and replaced with two crew couches to seat a total of five crewmen. The biggest risk in a rescue was the three upper seats \\"stroking\\" or collapsing onto the two lower seats in a rough landing, but no stroking occurred in previous missions. AS 208 Soon after Skylab 3's launch the crew's CSM developed a problem with Quad B, one of its four reaction control system thrusters. On August 2, 1973, six days later, a snowstorm-like effect outside the station startled the crew during breakfast. What appeared to be \\"a real blizzard\\" was fuel leaking from Quad D, opposite from Quad B. The malfunctions left two available quads, and while the spacecraft could operate with just one, the leaks posed a possible risk to other systems. The fuel for all quads and the main service propulsion system (SPS) engine were from the same batch; if the SPS fuel was contaminated, the CSM might not be able to deorbit. NASA considered bringing the crew home immediately, but because the astronauts were safe on the station with ample supplies and because plans for a rescue flight existed, the mission continued while the Saturn IB rocket AS 208 with CSM 119Wade, Mark. \\"Apollo Rescue CSM \\".

NASA announced on August 4 that Skylab 3 and Skylab 4 backup crewmen Vance Brand and Don Lind would fly any rescue mission; they had immediately begun training for the flight once the second quad had failed on August 2. After engineers found that the leaks would not disable the spacecraft, the two men used simulators to test reentry using two quads.

Lind oral history transcript, NASA Johnson Space Center Oral History Project, May 27, 2005. Human urine and feces samples and Apollo Telescope Mount and other film were the priorities. Although Skylab had two docking ports the primary one would be used if possible, jettisoning the Skylab crew's CSM if necessary. While many within NASA believed that the rescue mission would occur, within hours of the failure of the second quad the agency canceled the rescue mission. Beyond NASA's conclusion that the failed quads would not disable the Skylab 3 CSM and the SPS fuel was uncontaminated, Brand and Lind had already shown during their training as backup Skylab crewmen that a reentry with failed quads was safe. They also devised a method to deorbit with the command module's attitude control system. Later joking that they were \\"very efficient but perfectly stupid, because we have literally worked ourselves out of the mission\\", Brand and Lind continued to train for a rescue mission, as well as for their backup roles, but the Skylab 3 crew was able to complete its full 59-day mission on the station and safely return to Earth using the two functional RCS thruster quads,Belew, Leland.

AS 209 CSM is removed from its Saturn IB Launch vehicle in the Vehicle Assembly Building, following the successful recovery of Skylab 4. After the Skylab 4 launch, another rescue flight was assembled as a backup contingency. The Saturn IB rocket AS 209 was assembled in the Vehicle Assembly Building at Launch Complex 39 for possible use. It also used the CSM 119 Command Module that was to be launched with Brand and Lind. There were also plans for a short 20-day Skylab 5 flight that would use this backup CSM. The crew, likely consisting of Brand, Lind, and Skylab backup Science Pilot William B. Lenoir, would have performed some scientific research and closed out the station until the Space Shuttle was operational. However, the extension of Skylab 4 from fifty-six to eighty-four days obviated the need for the additional mission. AS 209 and CSM 119 were later used as a backup to the ASTP mission. Both are now on display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. CSM 119 is located in the Apollo/Saturn V Center. The Saturn IB booster for AS 209 is currently located in the Visitor Complex's Rocket Garden. It is displayed horizontally, mated to an Apollo FVV (Facilities Verification Vehicle) which was formerly displayed at the VAB's Visitor Complex c. October 1968.

She is the second ship named for the Battle of Vella Gulf, a naval engagement in the Solomons campaign of World War II, the first being an escort carrier commissioned in 1945. She was laid down on 22 April 1991 at Pascagoula, Mississippi, by Litton Industries, Ingalls Shipbuilding Division; launched on 13 June 1992; sponsored by Mary A. McCauley, wife of Vice Admiral William F. McCauley (Ret.); and commissioned alongside Pier 12, Naval Operating Base (NOB) Norfolk, Virginia, on 18 September 1993. Designed as a multi-mission ship, Vella Gulf is capable of sustained combat operations in Anti-Air, Anti-Submarine, Anti-Surface, and Strike warfare environments. She is employed in support of carrier battle groups, amphibious assault groups, ballistic missile defense, as well as in interdiction and escort missions. Her diverse combat capability is orchestrated by the Aegis Combat System, a fully integrated electronic detection, engagement, and fire control system. Aegis enables Vella Gulf to detect, evaluate, and engage an enemy with great firepower and accuracy. Ship history 1990s Vella Gulf successfully completed sea trials during the month of February 1998. In the months of May and June, she completed a two-month BALTOPS Cruise, taking part in the 26th annual maritime exercise U.S. Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) '98 in the Western Baltic Sea from 8 ‚Äì 19 June 1998. During the exercise, the commander, Carrier Group Eight, commanded the exercise from the ship. She then completed an underway replenishment, her LAMPS helicopters moved aboard, she completed a successful command and control exercise (C2X), and had made a port call at Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands. Upon the completion of C2X, Vella Gulf continued pre- deployment work-ups. Aerial view aft of Vella Gulf during a high-speed turn, torpedo evasion exercise, 7 December 2008 In January 1999, after winning her fifth consecutive \\"Battle \\"E\\",\\" the ship commenced training operations while hosting the week-long course Force Air Defense Commander training. Vella Gulfs successful completion, in February 1999, of Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX) '99 marked the end of a ten-month work-up. The vessel headed out for deployment to the Adriatic Sea on 26 March 1999. After a six-day transit, Vella Gulf took her position in the Adriatic Sea and participated in everything from Tomahawk Strike Ops to Fast-track Logistics Ops as part of Operation Noble Anvil. In May and June, Vella Gulf continued to participate in support of combat operations, fired Tomahawks, assumed warfare commander duties (ADC, ASUWC, ASWC and Launch Area Coordinator), and conducted numerous at-sea refueling and stores replenishment events until the relaxation of weapons posture and cessation of hostilities. Vella Gulf began the month of August engaged in multi-ship exercises, where she participated in DIVTACS, LeapFrogs, Tomahawk exercises, submarine exercises, Flight Ops, and Gunnery practice. On 22 September 1999 she returned home, then in November sailed to Yorktown, Virginia for a complete weapons offload. 2000s As part of the Carrier Battle Group (CVBG), and in response to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the ship set sail in support of defense and humanitarian efforts off the coast of New York. A week later, she deployed as part of the Carrier Battle Group, to the Mediterranean, and South-Asia in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Battle Group transited the Suez Canal on 13 October and arrived in the Arabian Sea on 15 October, before returning home in April 2002. In March 2003 she was assigned to Carrier Strike Group Eight. On 5 January 2007, Vella Gulf departed on a six-month cruise as part of the Expeditionary Strike Group (BATESG). She conducted operations in the Persian Gulf, Northern Arabian Sea with the French aircraft carrier (in support of Operation Enduring Freedom), Gulf of Oman and Gulf of Aden. She participated in multi-national exercises, including AMAN '07, hosted by Pakistan. Vella Gulf visited Agadir, Morocco and Gaeta, Italy as liberty ports of call, and twice visited Manama, Bahrain. She returned to her home port in Norfolk, Virginia on 3 July 2007. ;Anti-piracy service Suspected pirates surrendering to Vella Gulf Vella Gulf was identified as one of the U.S. Navy ships surrounding , a Ukrainian-owned, Belizean-registered ship carrying 33 T-72 tanks, RPGs and other munitions, after she was seized by pirates off Somalia on 25 September 2008. Several photographs used by news services were sourced as having been taken onboard Vella Gulf. Ultimately the ship was not recaptured, and a ransom was paid. On 11 February 2009 Vella Gulf responded to a distress call from the tanker Polaris in the Gulf of Aden. Polaris reported that pirates in a single skiff were attempting to board the tanker with ladders, though Polariss crew was able to thwart their efforts. Upon arriving in the area, Vella Gulf intercepted a skiff with seven men aboard. The crew aboard Polaris identified them as the attackers, and they were taken aboard Vella Gulf, transferred to the supply ship for processing, and sent to Kenya for trial. MV Faina as observed from Vella Gulf The following day, 12 February, Vella Gulf responded to a distress call from the Indian freighter Premdivya which reported that she had been pursued by pirates who had fired at the ship. Vella Gulf dispatched a helicopter to the scene which fired warning shots and chased the pirate skiff down. Vella Gulf launched a boarding party in two RHIBs (inflatable boats) and captured nine pirates, who were again transferred to Lewis and Clark for processing. 2010s In 2012 Vella Gulf Petty Officer 2nd Class Daniel Wilt sexually assaulted a female sailor while at sea, telling her he planned to kill her and dispose of her body overboard. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. In December 2015 the ship's website listed her as assigned to Carrier Strike Group Twelve.USS VELLA GULF (CG 72) On 23 April 2017, Vella Gulf left for an eight-month deployment to support maritime security operations in the Persian Gulf.\\" In July, she joined Carrier Strike Group 11 for three months, conducting air strikes against ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria. She returned on 15 December. 2020s In 2020, a US Navy budget plan proposed putting Vella Gulf, as well as her sisters , , and , on a path to early decommissioning, as they had not been modernized.

In Hinduism Bhairava with his consort, Bhairavi Aakash Bhairab in Kathmandu. Bhairava originates from the word bhƒ´ru, which means \\"fearful\\". Bhairava means \\"terribly fearful form\\". It is also known as one who destroys fear or one who is beyond fear. One interpretation is that he protects his devotees from dreadful enemies, greed, lust and anger. Bhairava protects his devotees from these enemies. These enemies are dangerous as they never allow humans to seek God within. There is also another interpretation: Bha means creation, ra means sustenance and va means destruction. Therefore, Bhairava is the one who creates, sustains and dissolves the three stages of life. Therefore, he becomes the ultimate or the supreme.Hiltebeitel, Alf, ed. Criminal Gods and Demon Devotees: Essays on the Guardians of Popular Hinduism. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1989 The origin of Bhairava can be traced to a conversation between Brahma and Vishnu which is recounted in the Shiva Mahapuranam.The ≈öiva Purana, ≈öatarudra Samhita, chapter-8, The ≈öiva Purana, part-III, (English translation), Motilal banarsidass Publishers Private Limited, Delhi, edition (reprint)-2002, p.1097-1103. In it, Vishnu inquired of Brahma, \\"Who is the supreme creator of the Universe?\\" Arrogantly, Brahma told Vishnu to worship him as Supreme Creator. One day, Brahma thought \\"I have five heads. Shiva also has five heads. I can do everything that Shiva does and therefore I am Shiva.\\" Brahma became a little egotistical as a result of this. Additionally, he began to forget the work of Shiva and also started interfering in what Shiva was supposed to be doing. Consequently, Mahadeva (Shiva) threw a small nail from his finger which assumed the form of Kala Bhairava and casually went to cut off one of Brahma's heads. The skull (Kapala) of Brahma is held in the hands of Kala Bhairava, Brahma's ego was destroyed and he became enlightened. From then on, he became useful to himself and to the world, and deeply grateful to Shiva. In the form of the Kala Bhairava, Shiva is said to be guarding each of these Shaktipeeth (Shakti temples). Each Shaktipeeth is accompanied by a temple dedicated to Bhairava.Chalier-Visuvalingam, Elizabeth. ‚ÄúBhairava‚Äôs Royal Brahmanicide: The Problem of the MahƒÅbrƒÅhma·πáa.‚Äù In Criminal Gods and Demon Devotees: Essays on the Guardians of Popular Hinduism.

There was one demon by name DahurƒÅsura·πá who got a boon that he could be killed only by a woman. Parvati took the form of Kali to kill him. The wrath of Kali killed the demon. After killing the demon, her wrath metamorphosed as a child. Kali fed the child with her milk. Shiva made both Kali and the child to merge with him. From this merged form of Shiva, Bhairava appeared in his eight forms (A·π£·π≠ƒÅ·πÖga Bhairavas).

Trika System Trika and Kashmiri Shaivism names the Absolute Reality (Para Brahman) as Bhairava. The Vij√±ƒÅna Bhairava Tantra is a key Tantra text of the Trika System. Cast as a discourse between the god Bhairava and his consort Bhairavi it briefly presents 112 Tantric meditation methods or centering techniques (Dharana). The text is a chapter from the Rudrayamala Tantra, a Bhairava Agama. Bhairavi, the goddess, asks Bhairava to reveal the essence of the way to realization of the highest reality. In his answer Bhairava describes 112 ways to enter into the universal and transcendental state of consciousness. References to it appear throughout the literature of Trika, Kashmir Shaivism, indicating that it was considered to be an important text in the schools of Kashmir Shaiva philosophy and Trika. .Jaideva Singh Vijnanabhairava or Divine Consiousness List of Bhairavas The list of manifestation of Shiva: *Trisandhyeshwar *Vishvesh *Bhiruk *Vakranath *Lambkarna *Vaman *Varaha (Baraha) *Rudra Mahadev *Chakrapani *Vikritaksh *Bhimlochan *Kramadishwar *Chanda *Unmatta Bhairav *Nakuleshwar *Umananda or Bhayaanand *Ruru *Nimish *Abhiru *Sanwart *Ghanteshwar *Ambar *Amar *Sarvanand *Mahodar *Rakshaseshwar (Nayanair) *Kapali *Chandrashekhar *Maharudra *Vakratund *Bhava *Sthanu *Nandikeshwar *Vatsnabh or Dandpani *Krodhish *Bhadrasen *Sambaranand *Sanhar *Trayambak *Tripuresh *Kapilambar *Marthanda *Kaal bhairav *Sarvanand *Amritaksha *Bhutesh *Bhishan *Baidyanath *Ksheer Kantak *Batuk Bhairav *Kapalbhairav *Tumbeswar *Jogesh *Kanpur Kaal Bhairava Mandir(Bhairava Ghat) *Ruru bhairav *Shri Khutkuni Bhairav *Shai Bhairav *Matang bhairav  In Buddhism  Thangka Depicting Vajrabhairava, ca. 1740s. Buddhism also adopted Bhairava (Tibetan: 'Jigs byed; Chinese: Buwei) as a deity and a dharmapala or dharma protector.\\"Bhairava\\" in Robert E. Buswell Jr., Donald S. Lopez Jr. The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism. The various buddhist forms of Bhairava (variously called Herukas, Vajrabhairava, MahƒÅkƒÅla and Yamantaka) are considered fierce deities and yidams (tantric meditational deity) in Tibetan Buddhism. They also have their own set of buddhist tantras, the Vajrabhairava tantras.Bulcsu Sikl√≥s, The Vajrabhairava tantras: Tibetan and Mongolian versions, English translation and annotations, Institute of Buddhist Studies, 1996 According to Tibetan tradition, these tantras were revealed to Lalitavajra in Oddiyana in the 10th century.Matthew Kapstein, Buddhism Between Tibet and China, p. 307. These texts play a particularly important role in the Sarma (new translation) traditions of Tibetan Buddhism, especially among the Gelug school where Vajrabhairava is one of the three central highest yoga tantra practices of the lineage.T. Skorupski, The Buddhist Forum, Volume 4, pp. 186‚Äì187 Because of this, it is also popular in Mongolia as a protector deity and was also popular among the Manchus. The deity is also central to Newar Buddhism.John C. Huntington, Dina Bangdel, The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art, p. 468. The tantric practices associated with Bhairava focus on the transformation of anger and hatred into understanding. Worship Kala Bhairava attended by devotees at thumb Temples or shrines to Bhairava are present within or near most Jyotirlinga temples. There are also the sacred twelve shrines dedicated to Shiva which can be found all across India including the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, Varanasi and the Kal Bhairav temple, Ujjain. The Patal Bhairav and Vikrant Bhairav shrines are located in Ujjain as well. One of the ancient temples of Kaal Bhairava is situated in Dhuri city (District Sangrur), Punjab. The idol of Kaal Bhairava in the temple was found hundreds of years ago. The temple has been managed by \\"Baba Shri Pritam Muni Ji\\" for many years. It is believed that Kaal Bhairava Ji resides here. Gorat Kashmiris are known to worship Bhairava during Shivratri. The renowned Hindu reformer, Adi Sankara composed a hymn on Kala Bhairava called \\"Sri Kalabhairava Ashtakam\\" in the city of Kashi. Observances Bhairava Ashtami, commemorating the day Kala Bhairava appeared on earth, is celebrated on Krishna paksha Ashtami of the Margashirsha month of the Hindu calendar. It is a day filled with special prayers and rituals. Iconography Rakta Bhairava Bhairava is depicted as being ornamented with a range of twisted serpents, which serve as earrings, bracelets, anklets, and sacred thread (yajnopavita). He wears a tiger skin and a ritual apron composed of human bones.Bhairava statuette in copper from 15th-16th century Nepal, in collection of Smithsonian Institution. Accessed August 11, 2007. Bhairava has a dog (Shvan) as his divine vahana (vehicle).

Bhairava is known as Bhairavar or Vairavar in Tamil, where he is often presented as a Grama devata or village guardian who safeguards the devotee in eight directions (ettu tikku). Known in Sinhalese as Bahirawa, he is said to protect treasures. Lord Bhairava is the main deity worshiped by the Aghora sect.Harper, Katherine Anne, and Brown, Robert L. (Eds) (2002).

Kala Bhairava temples can also be found around Shaktipeeths. It is said that Shiva allocated the job of guarding each of the 52 Shaktipeeths to one Bhairava. There are said to be 52 forms of Bhairava, which are considered a manifestation of Shiva himself. Traditionally, Kala Bhairava is the Grama devata in the rural villages of Maharashtra, where he is referred to as \\"Bhairava/Bhairavnath\\" and \\"Bairavar\\". In Karnataka, Lord Bhairava is the supreme God for the hindu community commonly referred to as Vokkaligas (Gowdas). Especially in the Jogi Vokkaliga, he is considered the caretaker and punisher.

It borders the counties of Leicestershire and Staffordshire, south-east of Burton upon Trent and north- west of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and south-west of Derby. It also covers Newhall, Oversetts, Midway and the villages of Church Gresley and Woodville, with the sub-district of Goseley. It has a population of 36,000. Castle Gresley is to the south-west and Albert Village to the south. History Swadlincote's name is derived from the Old English ', ' being a man's name and ' meaning cottages. Past forms of the name include Sivardingescote and Swartlincote.Lysons & Lysons, 1817, pp. 165‚Äì172. Local residents sometimes shorten its name to \\"Swad\\". The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded Swadlincote as a small manor. It was part of the parish of Gresley (latterly Church Gresley) until the 19th century.Lewis, 1848, pp. 280‚Äì283.Lewis, 1848, pp. 338‚Äì340. The first record of mineral extraction in the area is from the end of the 13th century, but the area remained rural until the industrialisation in the 18th century. The presence of coal and clay in the area led to urbanisation, as collieries, brickworks and potteries came to dominate. These industries continued to expand until the Second World War. One traditional bottle-shaped kiln survives in Alexandra Road.Pevsner & Williamson, 1978, page 336 The fire- clay strata in the coal measures has a high alumina content. Swadlincote is one of only six places in Britain with clay deposits of such quality. This makes it particularly suitable for salt glazing. The properties of the clay mean it is easily shaped into pipes that are resistant to sewage. The Public Health Act 1875 created a huge demand for locally produced pipes.James Woodward Limited, Swadlincote; South Derbyshire District Council, 2003 Emmanuel Church of England parish church is a Gothic Revival building consecrated in 1846, designed by Henry Isaac Stevens and completed in 1848. Swadlincote also had a Wesleyan chapel by then. Today the town has also the Roman Catholic church of Saints Peter and Paul. The first local-government body for the town was Swadlincote District local board of health, formed in 1871. Its area consisted of three civil parishes: Church Gresley, Stanton and Newhall and Swadlincote. Under the Local Government Act 1894, this became Swadlincote and District Urban District, renamed Swadlincote Urban District in 1951. In 1974 the urban district was merged with Repton Rural District and part of South East Derbyshire Rural District to form the present South Derbyshire District. left The urban district council was granted a coat of arms in 1947, in a design that reflected how Swadlincote was formed of part of the ancient parish of Church Gresley. Round the edge of the shield was a bordure or border in a \\"vairy\\" pattern of red and ermine, from the arms of the Gresley family, who took their name from the parish. The dedication of Gresley parish church to Saint George and Saint Mary was represented by their symbols: a cross and a fleur de lys respectively. The quartered ermine and red field of the shield was taken from the arms of the Stanhope family, Earls of Harrington. The Tudor roses were taken from the arms of Derbyshire County Council. Above the arms was a crest depicting a human arm holding a billet or: a yellow brick for the local brick-making industry. The arm rose from flames, indicative of mining of fireclay and coal. The Latin motto adopted: ' (\\"Riches from the earth\\") also referred to the mineral industries of Swadlincote. The current arms of South Derbyshire District Council, which bear the motto \\"The Earth Our Wealth\\" and also reflect this heritage. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s the town's Rink venue (now demolished and the site of industrial units) hosted major British and American pop stars. Gene Vincent appeared on 7 September 1963, and Ringo Starr in 1962, while he was drummer for Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. Governance Swadlincote covers four of the 17 wards of South Derbyshire District, returning 11 of the 36 district councillors: Church Gresley (two councillors), Newhall and Stanton (three), Midway (three) and Swadlincote (three). Of the eleven elected in 2007, ten are Labour Party and one a Conservative. Swadlincote forms part of the South Derbyshire parliamentary constituency. Between 1997 and 2010 its MP was Mark Todd (Labour). In the 2010 General Election, the seat was won by the Conservative Party candidate Heather Wheeler, an ex-leader of the Conservative group on South Derbyshire District Council. A notable previous MP is Edwina Currie (Conservative). Until 1983 the area was part of the Belper constituency. Geography The town is located within the Leicestershire and South Derbyshire Coalfield. Its landscape is marked by shallow valleys and ridges, shaped particularly by the mining activity which once dominated the area. Swadlincote lies within the National Forest, and there has been significant tree planting around Gresley Common, Swadlincote Woodlands and Church Gresley. The suburbs of Newhall and Stanton to the north-west lie along the Burton upon Trent and Swadlincote Green Belt, as a curb to development which could have caused Swadlincote to merge with the Winshill and Stapenhill districts of Burton-on-Trent. Most of the green belt lies in Derbyshire, with small tracts in Staffordshire. Hence most of Swadlincote's 21st-century expansion has been to the south and east of the centre, particularly adjacent to Woodville and Church Gresley. Swadlincote is encircled by several villages and hamlets including Hartshorne, Albert Village, Blackfordby, Overseal, Moira, Linton, Boundary, Norris Hill and Spring Cottage Economy The town originally had a prominent manufacturing heritage that made pipes and earthenware. It was the centre of the South Derbyshire coalfield, but mining ceased when Rawdon Colliery closed in 1993. Light manufacturing and service companies are sited on large industrial estates. Swadlincote has a moderate-sized town centre typical of the Midlands, containing national chain stores and small local businesses. It had a branch of Somerfield before the Co-operative Group took over the chain in 2009. The opening of a large chain supermarket on Coppice Side has been blamed as a factor behind the closure of several small independent shops. The shops that lined West Street and High Street from 1901 had disappeared by the early 21st century.A Century of Shopping in Swadlincote, 2011, pub. The Magic Attic Hepworth Retail Park is a fairly modern development with a restaurant, cinema and various shops. Plans were announced in 2008 for a new retail complex consisting of a cinema, DIY store and a nationally recognised clothing store. A link road called Sir Herbert Wragg Way has been built, named after the area's mid-20th century Member of Parliament and pipe-yard owner. A pub bar and restaurant opened on the former Empire Cinema site in April 2007, named The Paramount after Paramount Cars, a manufacturer based in the town in the 1950s. The pub closed in June 2013. Transport Swadlincote is near the junction of the A514 (Derby to A444) and A511 (Burton-upon-Trent to Ashby-de-la-Zouch) roads. In 1804 the Ashby Canal opened, with its northern terminus at Moira, Leicestershire. Also built were tramways to carry coal and ceramics from Swadlincote and elsewhere to the canal for shipment. The Midland Railway opened its Leicester to Burton upon Trent Line in 1845, with Gresley railway station to serve the area. It later built a branch with two stations, at Swadlincote itself and the neighbouring village of Woodville. In 1947 passenger services were withdrawn from both lines. British Railways closed Gresley railway station in 1964. Swadlincote remains one of the UK's largest towns to lack a railway station. Today the nearest station is , some away. The Leicester to Burton upon Trent Line remains open for goods traffic and in the 1990s there was a plan to restart the passenger service as the second phase of Leicestershire's Ivanhoe Line. This plan was shelved after the privatisation of British Rail and has not re- emerged. Swadlincote is served by the Arriva Midlands and Midland Classic bus companies. Swadlincote is on National Cycle Network Route 63. Though currently under development, it is signed from Civic Way through to Church Gresley via Maurice Lea Park with links onward to the heart of the National Forest. Education Schools in Swadlincote include Granville Academy at Woodville, William Allitt School at Newhall, St George's School and Pennine Way Junior Academy in Church Gresley, Belmont and Springfield Junior Schools and The Pingle Academy on Coronation Street, which with 1,200 pupils is Swadlincote's largest secondary school. The closest university is the University of Derby, 18 miles (29 km) to the north, with Staffordshire University's Lichfield campus an equal distance to the south-west. Amenities thumb Sharpe's Pottery Museum The main attractions in Swadlincote are local parks, such as Maurice Lea at Church Gresley and Eureka, Green Bank Leisure Centre, a large dry ski slope, and a '50s American Diner, said to be the largest such establishment in the UK. All are within easy reach of the town centre. Swadlincote Woodlands Forest Park is an 80 acre site, with more than 40,000 trees, two recreational forest trails and has a number of view points across the town. It is also the proposed site for the Pipeworks arts and media project, a charity-based community theatre and media production facility. The town's one museum is the Sharpe's Pottery Museum, devoted to the town's ceramic heritage.Sharpe's Pottery Centre, It contains a caf√© and the town's Tourist Information Centre is based there. Gresley F.C., formerly Gresley Rovers, is a semi-professional football team based at Moat Street, Church Gresley. Local youth organisations include No. 1211 (Swadlincote) Squadron of the Air Training Corps in Eureka Park. Accent and dialect The area around Swadlincote has historically had a distinct dialect. It shares terms and pronunciations common in Burton-upon-Trent (West Midlands) and Derby (East Midlands). Recently, people have been moving to the town from south Staffordshire (Tamworth, Rugeley, Lichfield, etc.), who use Swadlincote as a dormitory site, working elsewhere. This West Midlands accent can be heard alongside the traditional one.

Located a mile from the centres of Hendon and Golders Green, the area also contains the Brent Cross Shopping Centre, a major retail facility which opened in 1976,London Transport Museum View of shopping centre, 1977 as well as Brent South Shopping Park opposite of it. The \\"Brent Cross Flyover\\" A41 runs to the east of the shopping centre over the A406 North Circular Road, while the M1 motorway and A5 Edgware Road are to the west at Staples Corner interchange. In addition, the Northern line (Edgware branch) and Thameslink rail routes run on viaducts. The River Brent passes through the area, flowing from east to west in a man-made channel. The Shopping Centre falls within the NW4 postcode district; the Brent South Retail Park falls within NW2; and the Brent Cross tube station is within NW11.  History  Holiday Inn at Brent Cross \\"Brent Cross\\" was originally the name of a crossroads in the vicinity of the current Brent Cross Flyover. By 1944, the term was being used to describe addresses north of the A406 North Circular Road and west of the A41 Hendon Way and after the eponymous shopping centre was built it was also used to describe business addresses south of the North Circular. Previously the area had been known as Renters Farm, a name dating from 1309, and it remained largely farmland until the nineteenth century. In the late nineteenth century a sewage works was built there and Hendon Greyhound Stadium stood there from 1935 to 1972. In 1976 the Brent Cross Shopping Centre was opened, the first stand-alone shopping centre to be built in the United Kingdom. In the 1920s and 1930s, two major roads through the area were constructed, the east‚Äìwest A406 North Circular Road and the north‚Äìsouth A41 Hendon Way. In 1923 the Northern line (Edgware branch) was extended on a short viaduct over the River Brent. The River Brent at Brent Cross. The Ordnance Survey 1:50,000 scale mapping shows a sea of dark green here as the A406 North Circular Road and the A41 Hendon Way meet at the Brent Cross Flyover. A small weir impounds a head of water as the river flows down towards the Brent Reservoir. In 1964/65 the Brent Cross Flyover was built to carry the Hendon Way over the North Circular. During its construction on Saturday 20 June 1964 a fatal accident occurred while erecting a large crane at the site. The crane jib buckled and collapsed onto a coach travelling east on the North Circular Road killing seven passengers on board. A question was raised in parliament about the accident on 22 June. In the 1970s, the North Circular Road was upgraded with a huge east‚Äìwest flyover rising from Brent Cross above both the A5 road and the railway line. The M1 motorway was extended south to meet the North Circular Road slip roads below this flyover. That same decade, the shopping centre opened. Brent South Shopping Park, a 94,000 square feet retail park,https://completelyretail.co.uk/scheme/Brent- South-Shopping-Park-Brent-Cross was built in 2004. The park has 10 retail stores including Dorothy Perkins, DFS and Sports Direct.https://www.hammerson.com/destinations/retail-parks/brent-south- shopping-park-london/  Brent Cross Cricklewood development  Brent Cross Bus Station Northern Line viaduct over the North Circular Road in Brent Cross Brent Cross Cricklewood is a planned new town centre development in Hendon and Cricklewood. The development is planned to cost around ¬£4.5 billion to construct and will include 7,500 homes, of offices, four parks, transport improvements and a extension of Brent Cross Shopping Centre. The developers of the scheme are Hammerson and Standard Life Aberdeen. 200 new retail stores are included in the original plan. To counter the disruption of the area by the building works, the developers have offered to 'green up' the bridge over the North Circular and maintain it as a 'living bridge' making a horticultural contribution to the basic scheme. As market for new retail stores changes and demand is expected to decline with the shift to online shopping, BXS is changing its delivery plan and intends to focus on residential development first. Construction was planned to start in 2018 and be completed in 2021-22 but the retail development has currently been put on hold.

These calcium deposits decrease the size of cranial foramina, and can decrease the circumference of the cervical spinal canal. In the few cases recorded, most of the sufferers died in childhood. Cause The underlying genetics are uncertain. Diagnosis Among the medical signs are dacryocystitis, seizures, intellectual disability, and paralysis, each of which is a complication resulting from the diminutive foramina. A common sign reported as a result of the disease has been a difference of the size of the eyes. Society Peter Bogdanovich's 1985 drama film Mask drew public attention to the case of Roy L. \\"Rocky\\" Dennis, an American boy who died of the disorder in 1978.

It is the northern island of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago. It was historically called L√ºtke Land after Friedrich Benjamin von L√ºtke who explored it. It lies approximately 400 km north of the Russian mainland. It has an area of , making it the 30th-largest island in the world. It is part of Russian Arctic National Park. Geography Severny Island is separated from Yuzhny Island (Southern) by the narrow Matochkin Strait. Forty percent of the island is covered by the Severny Island ice cap, which is the largest glacier by area and by volume in Europe (if counted as part of it). Severny Island is known for its numerous glaciers. Cape Flissingsky is the easternmost point of Severny Island. Ice cap and glaciers Unlike Yuzhny Island, Severny has an inner ice cap with numerous glaciers, most of which have their terminus on the eastern or western shore of the island.J. J. Zeeberg, Climate and Glacial History of the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago, Russian Arctic. History Sukhoy Nos cape, located at the southern end of the island, was used for nuclear weapons testing between 1958 and 1961. The Tsar Bomba hydrogen bomb test (October 30, 1961) destroyed all buildings in the village of Severny (both wooden and brick). The village was located 55 kilometres (34 miles) from ground zero within the Sukhoy Nos test range. Tsar Bomba was the most powerful nuclear weapon detonated and was the most powerful anthropogenic explosion in human history. It had a yield of 50 megatons of TNT, scaled down from its maximum 100 megaton design yield. Severny is now the site of a Russian Army base and has a harbor. There is a meteorological station at Cape Zhelaniya, Severny's northernmost cape.  Gallery  File:Kap Zhelanyia 2 2014-09-03.jpgView of Cape Zhelaniya.

Bradbury (1956‚Äì2011Remembering Robert Bradbury, March 6, 2011, by George Dvorsky, Sentient Developments, 2011, issue 3.), based on the Dyson sphere, of immense computational capacity. It is an example of a Class B stellar engine, employing the entire energy output of a star to drive computer systems. This concept derives its name from the nesting Russian Matryoshka dolls. The concept was deployed by its inventor, Robert Bradbury, in the anthology Year Million: Science at the Far Edge of Knowledge. Concept The concept of a Matrioshka brain comes from the idea of using Dyson spheres to power an enormous, star-sized computer. The term \\"Matrioshka brain\\" originates from Matryoshka dolls, which are wooden Russian nesting dolls. Matrioshka brains are composed of several Dyson spheres nested inside one another, the same way that Matryoshka dolls are composed of multiple nested doll components. The innermost Dyson sphere of the Matrioshka brain would draw energy directly from the star it surrounds and give off large amounts of waste heat while computing at a high temperature. The next surrounding Dyson sphere would absorb this waste heat and use it for its computational purposes, all while giving off waste heat of its own. This heat would be absorbed by the next sphere, and so on, with each sphere radiating at a lower temperature than the one before it. For this reason, Matrioshka brains with more nested Dyson spheres would tend to be more efficient, as they would waste less heat energy. The inner shells could run at nearly the same temperature as the star itself, while the outer ones would be close to the temperature of interstellar space. The engineering requirements and resources needed for this would be enormous. The term \\"Matrioshka brain\\" was invented by Robert Bradbury as an alternative to the Jupiter brain‚Äîa concept similar to the Matrioshka brain, but on a smaller planetary scale and optimized for minimal signal propagation delay. A Matrioshka brain design is concentrated on sheer capacity and the maximum amount of energy extracted from its source star, while a Jupiter brain is optimized for computational speed. Possible uses Some possible uses of such an immense computational resource have been proposed. One idea suggested by Charles Stross, in his novel Accelerando, would be to use it to run perfect simulations or uploads of human minds into virtual reality spaces supported by the Matrioshka brain. Stross even went so far as to suggest that a sufficiently powerful species utilizing enough raw processing power could launch attacks upon, and manipulate, the structure of the universe itself. In Godplayers (2005), Damien Broderick surmises that a Matrioshka brain would allow simulating entire alternate universes. The futurist and transhumanist author Anders Sandberg wrote an essay speculating on implications of computing on the massive scale of machines such as the Matrioshka brain, published by the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies. Matrioshka brains and other megastructures are a common theme in the fictional Orion's Arm universe where they are used by superintelligences as processing nodes connected via artificial wormholes.
