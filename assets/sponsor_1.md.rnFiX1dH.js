Occupational hazards can encompass many types of hazards, including chemical hazards, biological hazards (biohazards), psychosocial hazards, and physical hazards. In the United States, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conduct workplace investigations and research addressing workplace health and safety hazards resulting in guidelines. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) establishes enforceable standards to prevent workplace injuries and illnesses. In the EU a similar role is taken by EU-OSHA. Occupational hazard as a term signifies both long-term and short-term risks associated with the workplace environment and is a field of study within occupational safety and health and public health. Short term risks may include physical injury, while long-term risks may be increased risk of developing cancer or heart disease.  Chemical hazards  Chemical hazards are a subtype of occupational hazards that involve dangerous chemicals. Exposure to chemicals in the workplace can cause acute or long-term detrimental health effects. There are many classifications of hazardous chemicals, including neurotoxins, immune agents, dermatologic agents, carcinogens, reproductive toxins, systemic toxins, asthmagens, pneumoconiotic agents, and sensitizers. NIOSH sets recommended exposure limits (REL's) as well as recommends preventative measures on specific chemicals in order to reduce or eliminate negative health effects from exposure to those chemicals. Additionally, NIOSH keeps an index of chemical hazards based on their chemical name, Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CAS No.), and RTECS Number. This is evidence that workplace exposure to hazards such as silica dust, engine exhausts or welding fumes, among others are associated with increased prevalence of heart disease. Other workplace hazards have been shown to increase risk of pulmonary heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure.  Biological hazards  Biological agents, including microorganisms and toxins produced by living organisms, can cause health problems in workers. Influenza is an example of a biohazard which affects a broad population of workers. Those who work outdoors encounter numerous biological hazards, including bites and stings from insects, spiders, snakes and scorpions, contact dermatitis from exposure to urushiol from poisonous Toxicodendron plants, Lyme disease, West Nile virus, and coccidioidomycosis. According to NIOSH, outdoor workers at risk for these hazards \\"include farmers, foresters, landscapers, groundskeepers, gardeners, painters, roofers, pavers, construction workers, laborers, mechanics, and any other workers who spend time outside.\\" Health care professionals are at risk to exposure to blood-borne illnesses (such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C) and particularly to emerging infectious diseases, especially when not enough resources are available to control the spread of the disease. Veterinary health workers, including veterinarians, are at risk for exposure to zoonotic disease. Those who do clinical work in the field or in a laboratory risk exposure to West Nile virus if performing necropsies on birds affected by the virus or are otherwise working with infected tissue. Other occupations at risk to biological hazard exposure include poultry workers, who are exposed to bacteria; and tattooists and piercers, who risk exposure to blood-borne pathogens.  Psychosocial hazards  Psychosocial hazards are occupational hazards that affect someone's social life or psychological health. Psychosocial hazards in the workplace include occupational burnout and occupational stress, which can lead to burnout.  Physical hazards  Physical hazards are a subtype of occupational hazards that involve environmental hazards that can cause harm with or without contact. Physical hazards include ergonomic hazards, radiation, heat and cold stress, vibration hazards, and noise hazards.  Noise  Each year in the US, twenty-two million workers are exposed to noise levels that could potentially harm their health. Occupational hearing loss is the most common occupational illness in the manufacturing sector. Workers in certain fields, such as musicians, mine workers, and even those involved with stock car racing, are exposed to higher levels of noise and therefore are at a higher risk of developing hearing loss. While permanent, noise-induced hearing loss is preventable. As such a widespread issue, NIOSH has been committed to preventing future hearing loss for workers by establishing recommended exposure limits (RELs) of 85 dB(A) for an 8-house time-weighed average (TWA). The Buy Quiet program was developed by NIOSH to encourage employers to reduce workplace noise levels by purchasing quieter models of tools and machinery. Additionally, a partnership with the National Hearing Conservation Association (NHCA) has resulted in the creation of the Safe-in-Sound Award to recognize excellence and innovation in the field of hearing loss prevention.

She is the largest ferry in the fleet and the 5th vessel to carry the name Smyril, which is the Faroese word for Merlin. The ferry takes 200 cars and 975 passengers. The ferry services Suðuroy. It has 2-3 daily arrivals to Krambatangi, the Suðuroy ferry port. The trip from Tórshavn to Tvøroyri takes 2 hours. It is then possible to go by bus from the harbour of Krambatangi to all other villages on the island. History The current Smyril was built at the IZAR shipyard in San Fernando, Spain. She entered service on the 15 October 2005. Previous vessels Since the 1890s the Strandfaraskip Landsins have operated five different ships named Smyril. Smyril (I) Smyril I was built in the 1890s and began as a smaller transport boat in Tvøroyri in the Faroe islands. Smyril (II) Smyril II was built in Frederikshavn in Denmark in 1931, arriving in the Faroe Islands in 1932. It was much more modern than the first Smyril, it had a large saloon with sofas, and it even had a small saloon for smokers. The ferry was welcomed with song and music on the harbour of Tórshavn. Two days after arrival, the ferry started to sail on route between the islands. It sailed from Tórshavn, the capital, to many villages, i.e. to the villages on the eastern side of Eysturoy, to the villages on the eastern side of Sandoy and to several of the villages on the eastern side of Suðuroy, to the village Vestmanna, which is on the west coast of Streymoy and to Vágar island and sometimes also to smaller island like Mykines and Nólsoy. Smyril II also sailed to Klaksvík. Smyril I left the Faroe Islands on the same day as the new ferry started on her route, after sailing between the islands in 35 years. Smyril (III) Smyril III was built in Tórshavn, at the shipyard Tórshavnar Skipasmiðja, in 1967. It was a modern fast-moving and seaworthy vessel. With the new Smyril the sailing time between Torshavn and Tvøroyri was reduced from four to three hours. Smyril III could accommodate 300 passengers, but with the changes that were made in the infrastructure in the Faroes in the 1970s, the need for a larger vessel, a real car-ferry, grew to cover the community’s requirements. Smyril (IV) Smyril IV was built in 1969 as MV Morten Mols for the Danish shipping company Mols-Linien and bought by Strandfaraskip Landsins in 1975. It began to show signs of wear against the strong Faroese elements in the mid 1990s and by 2003 it was facing extreme difficulties in sailing through the strong currents of the islands. It was eventually replaced and taken out of operation in October 2005 with Smyril V. New harbour The new harbour at Krambatangi under construction in 2003. A new harbour was built to accommodate the newer larger version of the Smyril in 2004. The new harbour is called Krambatangi. The former harbour was a few hundred metres further east, on the same side of the fjord of Tvøroyri, the southern side. The old harbour was called Drelnes. The new harbour Krambatangi is located between the villages of Trongisvágur and Øravík, and is in Øravíkarlíð, not far from Trongisvágur. The villages around the fjord of Trongisvágsfjørður are Øravík, Trongisvágur, Tvøroyri and Froðba. Tvøroyri, which is one of the largest villages on Suðuroy, is just on the opposite side of the fjord.

This monastery is believed to have been founded by St. Euphemius, an Orthodox missionary in the Karelian lands. In 1419, the Swedes burnt down the Nikolo-Korelsky Monastery. The abbey stood in ruins until 1471, when two sons of Marfa Boretskaya were killed by a vicious storm and their bodies were recovered on the beach near the monastery twelve days later. At the urging of Boretskaya, the monastery was restored and her sons were buried there. Entrance to the Karelian Monastery of St. Nicholas (1691), now in the Kolomenskoe Museum of Moscow On 24 August 1553, a ship of Richard Chancellor reached the salt-mining settlement of Nenoksa, which is still famous for its traditional wooden architecture. The British sailors proceeded to the Nikolo-Korelsky Monastery, where they were surprised to find a community of \\"sailors in soutanes\\" and a pier large enough to accommodate several ships. The main church of this extraordinary establishment was dedicated to Saint Nicholas, the holy patron of sailors; hence, the whole White Sea became known in the 16th-century English maps as \\"St. Nicholas Bay\\". The St. Nicolas Cathedral after the restoration works in 2000s The Nikolo- Karelsky Monastery flourished after the establishment of the Muscovy Company, as the bulk of their trade passed through the local harbour. In late 1613, the complex was captured and looted by Polish-Lithuanian vagabonds, the Lisowczycy. In August 1618, the harbour was visited by John Tradescant the elder, who conducted a survey of an island situated opposite the monastery. The extant buildings of the monastery were constructed at the close of the Muscovite period. The five-domed cathedral of St. Nicholas was built in 1670–74, preceded by the Assumption church (1664–67), to which it is joined by a gallery. Several decades later, the walls and towers were built of timber; the best preserved of these towers was transported by the Soviets to Kolomenskoe, Moscow, where it may be seen to this day. After the Revolution, the Monastery was abolished. The 17th-century buildings of the Nikolo-Korelsky monastery were adapted and are still used for shipbuilding purposes.

Some toxic agents that are known to alter the immune system include: industrial chemicals, heavy metals, agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, drugs, ultraviolet radiation, air pollutants and some biological materials. The effects of these immunotoxic substances have been shown to alter both the innate and adaptive parts of the immune system. Consequences of xenobiotics affect the organ initially in contact (often the lungs or skin). Some commonly seen problems that arise as a result of contact with immunotoxic substances are: immunosuppression, hypersensitivity, and autoimmunity.The toxin-induced immune dysfunction may also increase susceptibility to cancer. The study of immunotoxicology began in the 1970s. However, the idea that some substances have a negative effect on the immune system was not a novel concept as people have observed immune system alterations as a result of contact toxins since ancient Egypt. Immunotoxicology has become increasingly important when considering the safety and effectiveness of commercially sold products. In recent years, guidelines and laws have been created in the effort to regulate and minimize the use of immunotoxic substances in the production of agricultural products, drugs, and consumer products. One example of these regulations are FDA guidelines mandate that all drugs must be tested for toxicity to avoid negative interactions with the immune system, and in-depth investigations are required whenever a drug shows signs of affecting the immune system. Scientists use both in vivo and in vitro techniques when determining the immunotoxic effects of a substance. Immunotoxic agents can damage the immune system by destroying immune cells and changing signaling pathways. This has wide-reaching consequences in both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Changes in the adaptive immune system can be observed by measuring levels of cytokine production, modification of surface markers, activation, and cell differentiation. There are also changes in macrophages and monocyte activity indicating changes in the innate immune system.  Immunosuppression  Some common agents that have been shown to cause immunosuppression are corticosteroids, radiation, heavy metals, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, drugs, air pollutants and immunosuppressive drugs. These chemicals can result in mutations found in regulatory genes of the immune system, which alter the amount of critical cytokines produced and can cause insufficient immune responses when antigens are encountered.These agents have also been known to kill or damage immune cells and cells in the bone marrow, resulting in difficulty recognizing antigens and create novel immune responses. This can be measured by decreased IgM and IgG antibody levels which immune suppression. T regulatory cells, which are critical to maintaining the correct level of response in the immune system, also appear to be altered by some agents. In the presence of certain immunotoxic substances, granulocytes of the innate immune system have also been observed to be damaged causing the rare disease agranulocytosis. Vaccine effectiveness can also be decreased when the immune system is suppressed by immunotoxic substances. In vitro T-lymphocyte activation assays have been useful when determining which substances have immunosuppressive properties.  Hypersensitivity  Hypersensitive or allergic reactions, such as asthma, are commonly associated with immunotoxic agents and the number of people exhibiting these symptoms is increasing in industrial countries.This partially due to the increasing number of immunotoxic agents. Nanomaterials are commonly absorbed through the skin or inhaled and are known for causing hypersensitive responses by recruiting immune cells. These nanomaterials are often encountered when a person is in contact with chemicals in an occupational, consumer, or environmental setting. Agents that are known for creating a hypersensitive response include poison ivy, fragrances, cosmetics, metals, preservatives, and pesticides. These molecules that are so small, they act as haptens and bind to larger molecules to induce an immune response. An allergic response is induced when T lymphocytes recognize these haptens and recruit professional antigen- presenting cells. IgE antibodies are important when looking at hypersensitive reactions but cannot be used to definitively determine the effects of an immunotoxic agents. Because of this, in vivo testing is the most effective way to determine the potential toxicity of nanomaterials and other agents that are believed to cause hypersensitivity.  Autoimmunity  Immunotoxic agents can increase the occurrence of immune system attacks on self molecules. Although autoimmunity mostly occurs as a result of genetic factors, immunotoxic agents such as asbestos, sulfadiazine, silica, paraffin and silicone can also increase the chance of an autoimmune attack. These agents are known for causing disturbances to the carefully regulated immune system and increasing the development of autoimmunity. Changes in the circulating regulatory and responder T cells are good indicators of an autoimmune response induced by an immunotoxic agent. The effects of autoimmunity have been examined primarily through studies with animal models. Currently, there is not a screen to determine how agents affect human autoimmunity, because of this much of the current knowledge about autoimmunity in response to immunotoxic agents comes from the observations of individuals who have been exposed to suspected immunotoxic agents.

Plot summary The film is about a debutante who follows the man she loves and hopes to marry to Zurich where he studies violin at a conservatory. There she meets a piano student who falls madly in love with her. She must then choose between this man who loves her more than his music and the violinist who loves his music more than anything else. Rhapsody features music by Franz Liszt, Sergei Rachmaninov, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Felix Mendelssohn, Claude Debussy, and Pablo de Sarasate. Detailed Plot The film opens with debutante Louise Durant (Elizabeth Taylor) announcing to her haughty father (played by Louis Calhern) that she is leaving their luxurious home to go to Zurich with her lover—an aspiring violinist, Paul Bronte (Vittorio Gassman). Her father disapproves. She cannot leave, because he needs her as hostess of his luncheon of VIPs. He sees no reason to waste time with aspiring artists, when he has the cream of the crop at the luncheon she is about to miss. Besides, she lacks the discipline to study piano at the conservatory. She scoffs, \\"You'll see. Have you ever stopped me from doing what I want?\\" He replies \\"No\\". The couple joyfully motor to Zurich in a convertible. Bronte playfully muses how crazy it is to take her, when he must work. In Zurich, the couple bring Durant's bags to her elegant furnished flat. Paul inquires about the \\"For Rent\\" sign that the matron (played by Celia Lovsky) had just removed from the front window. She explains that the attic had just been rented to an American (James Guest, played by John Ericson). When the affable Guest shows, Bronte tries unsuccessfully to convince Guest that he must give his room to Bronte because of seniority. Guest won't be conned. Guest is immediately infatuated with Durant, but she doesn't notice, while Bronte lets him know she is off-limits. Durant goes to the conservatory to audition. While waiting, she is enraptured with the piano player before her. She is pleased to discover it is Guest. The professor who oversaw the audition ushers in Bronte. They practice while Durant impatiently waits. Tension mounts as Bronte prioritizes practice over companionship with Durant. When Bronte learns he is scheduled to perform at the Zurich Symphony in three weeks, he tells a deeply disappointed Durant he will have no time for her until the concert. Meanwhile a grand piano arrives for Durant. Guest joins Duarant to try out the new piano, becoming friends. Durant's father visit her in Zurich. When she introduces him to Bronte, the father's disdain is palpable. When she asks her father if he will go to Bronte's Tchaikovsky concert at the symphony, he replies, \\"No. I have already heard Tchaikovsky.\\" Yet, Father asks Bronte for a serenade. Bronte quips, \\"No. I only perform for pleasure or money. Something you would understand.\\" Father admits he doesn't like Bronte's arrogance; Daughter retorts \\"You dislike him because he is like you and doesn't crumple like all the other men.\\" Father correctly predicts their relationship is doomed, because Bronte can't give her the attention she needs, and he is a hummingbird that can't be caged. Bronte's solo at the Symphony is a smashing success During the concert Durant unsuccessfully tries to capture his attention, but he is oblivious, engrossed in the music, like everyone else but her. When she goes back stage, the joyous crowd surrounds him and she can't get near, but sees him spontaneously kiss another woman in ecstatic celebration. When music agents shuffle him off to a back room to make deals, Durant calls out to him, but he waives her off. When he leaves the room hours later, she is sulking. Energized and happy to see her, he spouts off all his future plans for a tour with a finale in Rome, but indicates she can't go with as she would be a distraction. The couple fight. He has no time for her; she is ruining the day his music career takes off. The next day Durant sees him leave on the tour with another woman. She tries to kill herself with pills, but Guest intervenes. Guest nurses Durant to health, giving her the cloying affection she needs. Her fathers approves. She is determined to leave Zurich and the awful memories. Guest, head over heals in love with a woman who only views him as a friend, is determined to go with her—even though it means giving up his music studies. She lets him follow her to Paris, where she marries him to try to get over Bronte. Bronte bumps into Durant in Paris, and the two admit they have not fallen out of love. Meanwhile, Guest is floundering, squandering Durant's money on booze—undoubtedly not getting the romantic attention he desires. Bronte is disgusted that Durant has allowed his talent to go rot. When Durant tells her father she must divorce Guest, he urges her to wait. \\"Don't kick him when he is down. Help him get up first.\\" She does. She moves back with him to Zurich and puts all of her focus on his musical development. Guest eventually secures a solo performance at the Symphony—nearly identical to Bronte's. But just prior to the important concert, Durant refuses to give him a token of herself for good luck. She insists he doesn't need her to succeed, that his talent is from his work alone. She confesses that she intends to leave with Bronte after the performance. Guest is devastated. At the concert, Guest is distraught throughout performance. He repeatedly looks at the empty chair reserved for his wife. Despite his anguish, he pulls off a standing ovation.

It was used contemporaneously with Elamite Cuneiform and possibly records the Elamite language. Overview It was in use for a brief period of time during the last quarter of the 3rd millennium BC. It is often claimed that Linear Elamite is a syllabic writing system derived from the older Proto-Elamite writing system, although this has not been proven. Linear Elamite has not been deciphered.Francois Desset. Linear Elamite writing, in The Elamite world, eds. J. Alvarez-Mon, G.-P. Basello et Y. Wicks, Routledge World Series, Taylor and Francis, Abington, 2018 Early attempts by Carl Frank (1912) and Ferdinand Bork (1924) made limited progress.Walther Hinz, Problems of Linear Elamite, The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland No. 2 (1975), pp. 106-115 Later work by Walther Hinz and Piero Meriggi furthered the work.Piero Meriggi, La scritura proto-elamica.

Parte IIIa: Testi (Rome, 1974)Walter Hinz, Altiranische Funde und Forschungen (Berlin 1969) Demise It is thought that the use of Linear Elamite ended circa 2100 BC with the death of King Kutik-Inshushinak, last ruler of the Awan Dynasty in Susa. After his death the linear script fell into disuse, and Susa was overrun by the Third dynasty of Ur, while Elam fell under control of the Shimashki dynasty (also Elamite of origin).Encyclopedia Iranica: Elam - Simashki dynasty, F. Vallat Influences Scholars have been comparing the Indus valley script with Linear Elamite. The two languages were contemporary to each other. Scholars gained knowledge of the Elamite language from a bilingual monument called the \\"Table of the Lion\\" in the Louvre museum. The monument contained the same text in Akkadian, a known writing system, and in Linear Elamite. On comparing this ancient language to the Indus script, a number of similar symbols have been found. Discovered texts There are only 22 known documents in Linear Elamite; they are identified by letters A-V (Hinz, 1969, pp. 11–44; Andre‚ and Salvini, 1989, pp. 58–61); of these, 19 are on stone and clay objects excavated in the acropolis at Susa (now kept in the Louvre in Paris). Other objects are held at the National Museum of Iran. Akkadian inscription of king Kutik-Inshushinak, \\"Table au Lion\\", Louvre Museum Sb 17 The most important longer texts, partly bilingual, appear in monumental contexts. They are engraved on large stone sculptures, including a statue of the goddess Narunte (I), the \\"table au lion\\" (A), and large votive boulders (B, D), as well as on a series of steps (F, G, H, U) from a monumental stone stairway, where they alternated with steps bearing texts with Akkadian titles of Puzur-Inšušinak. A unique find is item Q, a silver vase with a single line of perfectly executed text, kept in the Tehran Museum. There are also a few texts on baked-clay cones (J, K, L), a clay disk (M), and clay tablets (N, O, R). Some objects (A, I, C) include both Linear Elamite and Akkadian cuneiform inscriptions. The bilingual and biographic inscriptions of the monumental stairway as a whole, and the votive boulder B have inspired the first attempts at decipherment of Linear Elamite (Bork, 1905, 1924; Frank, 1912). Nine texts have also been found on silver beakers (X, Y, Z, F’, H’, I’, J’, K’ and L’).Francois Desset, Nine Linear Elamite Texts Inscribed on Silver “Gunagi” Vessels (X, Y, Z, F’, H’, I’, J’, K’ and L’): New Data on Linear Elamite Writing and the History of the Sukkalmaḫ Dynasty, Iran, Journal of the British Institute of Persian Studies, Volume 56, 2018 - Issue 2 Note that some of the extant Linear Elamite inscriptions are suspected of being forgeries.

It is owned by the Faroese government and runs ferries (Oyggjaleiðir - Island links) and buses (Bygdaleiðir - Village links, with blue-painted buses). Until February 2008 the administration of Strandfaraskip Landsins was located in Tórshavn, but in 2007 Jacob Vestergaard, who was minister at that time decided to move the administration to the island Suðuroy (the southernmost island) in order to get more public jobs there and also because the largest ferry of the company is Smyril M/F which is on daily route between Tórshavn and Krambatangi on Suðuroy.  The Ferries   M/F Smyril - the ferry to Suðuroy  The ferry MS Smyril takes up to 975 passengers and up to 200 cars; it was built in Spain in 2005.SSL.fo M/F Smyril The trip with Smyril takes two hours. Smyril disembarks from Krambatangi ferry port near Tvøroyri in Suðuroy every morning except for Saturday morning when it starts from Tórshavn. Monday morning Smyril's first trip starts at 6 in the morning, so that people can be in time for work, if they spend the weekend in Suðuroy and start work or school in Tórshavn at 8 or 9. In 2007 the number of daily departures were increased so that there were now 3 daily departures from Suðuroy (and three from Tórshavn) on Mondays and Wednesdays, and one extra departure from Suðuroy on Friday evening.Aktuelt.fo Smyril fer nú at sigla fleiri túrar Because the trip takes two hours and the ferry is so large, it is very expensive to run, the extra departure on Wednesday has been taken away in wintertime, so that Smyril now only has two daily departures from Suðuroy at 7 in the morning and on 15:30, and 2 departures from Tórshavn at 13:00 and at 18:30, almost every day has only two daily departures in wintertime, Monday is the exception, it still has three departures from Suðuroy daily and three departures from Tórshavn, the schedule on Monday has been like this since 2007: From Krambatangi, Suðuroy at 6:00, from Tórshavn at 8:30, from Suðuroy at 11:00, from Tórshavn at 16:00, from Suðuroy at 18:30 and the last departure from Tórshavn is at 21:00 (it may have changed since this was written, please check on the ssl.fo website). The people who live in Suðuroy wish that they had more departures like the Sandoy and Kalsoy, but the politicians say that it is not possible. There have been three daily departures every Wednesday, which was very good for tourism, because tourists (both foreign tourists and Faroese tourists from other islands) could make a one-day trip to Suðuroy by leaving Tórshavn at 8:30 in the morning, arriving in Suðuroy at 10:30 and spend a day in Suðuroy and take the ferry back to Tórshavn at 18:30. This is still possible on Mondays, but Wednesday which was a very popular day for one-day island hoppers is not an option for 2013, the trip will not come back they say. The trip was taken off the schedule from 1 September 2012 for the winter period in order to save some money,Aktuelt.fo Suðuroyingar og kalsoyingar missa ein túr (in Faroese) but it may not come back again when the summer period starts 1 April 2013. Many politicians who were not in the political parties of the coalition, and especially politicians from Suðuroy and Sandoy were strongly against that Smyril and Teistin would have to cut down their budget and therefor also cut down one or more weekly departures.Aktuelt.fo Tinglimir í øðini inn á skerjingar (in Faroese)  M/F Teistin - the ferry to Sandoy  Next after Smyril the ferry to Skopun on Sandoy island is the second largest, it is called Teistin and takes up to 288 passengers and up to 33 cars. M/F Teistin was built on Skála Skipasmiðja in the Faroe Islands in 2001.ssl.fo, M/F Teistin  M/F Ritan – previously the ferry to Nólsoy – since 2010 the ferry to Svínoy and Fugloy  For many years the ferry Másin sailed the route from the village of Hvannasund on Viðoy (Northern Islands) to the two smaller islands of Svínoy and Fugloy. But it is not in use anymore. Instead the ferry Ritan, which earlier used to be on the route between Tórshavn and Nólsoy now sails between Hvannasund, Svínoy and Fugloy.  M/F Ternan - earlier the ferry to Vágar, later to Sandoy and now to Nólsoy  Ternan M/F in Tórshavn The Nólsoy ferry is now M/F Ternan, which earlier was on route to Skopun on Sandoy, and before the subsea tunnel to Vágar was built it was on route to Vágar together with M/F Sam. The ferry to the island Sandoy also goes to the small island Hestur, but only on request. (The Faroese word Tilkalling means by request)ssl.fo, the time schedule of Teistin M/F Teistin departs from Gamlarætt, which is not so far from Tórshavn, it takes only 15 minutes by car. Gamlarætt is near the villages Kirkjubøur and Velbastaður on the south west coast of Streymoy island. Teistin has a frequent schedule, it goes up to 9 times daily each way (9 times from Skopun and 9 times from Gamlarætt).  Earlier sea routes replaced by subsea tunnels  Earlier there were ferries between Vestmanna on Streymoy and the island of Vágar to the west, where the airport is, and there was a ferry connection from Leirvík on Eysturoy island to Klaksvík on Borðoy in the Northern Islands, but after the undersea tunnels between these areas came, there was no longer any need for the ferries. The Norðoyatunnilin now connects Eysturoy with Klaksvík, and the Vágatunnilin connects Streymoy with Vágar.

Halliwell started his career in the youth team at London side Wimbledon, before moving in the Scottish Football League with Clyde. After leaving the Cumbernauld side in 2005, Halliwell spent the next six years playing for seven different Scottish clubs, culminating in a loan spell back at Clyde from former rivals Partick Thistle. After being released by the Glasgow side, Halliwell moved into the Junior ranks with Sauchie, then Shettleston. Career He began his career at the now defunct Wimbledon, but it was at Clyde, whom he joined in 2000, where he established himself. Halliwell remained with Clyde for five years, and in 2005 signed for Dunfermline Athletic. During Halliwell's Dunfermline career, Allan McGregor was signed on loan from Rangers, meaning the Englishman slipped to being second-choice goalkeeper. However, since Rangers would not permit McGregor to play against them, Halliwell would take his place whenever the Pars played the Glasgow club. Halliwell signed for St Johnstone in August 2006. He made his league debut for Saints on 5 August 2006, against Clyde, his former club. He kept a clean sheet in a goalless draw. After leaving St Johnstone he teamed up with his former manager at Clyde, Billy Reid, at Hamilton Academical where he went on to make a useful contribution to the team's successful season in the First Division, gaining promotion to the Scottish Premier League. Halliwell was offered a new contract by Accies but rejected it and left the club. After a successful trial spell, Halliwell was signed by Queen of the South manager Gordon Chisholm minutes before their first pre-season game against Scottish Football League newcomers Annan Athletic on 12 July 2008. In July 2009, Halliwell joined Greenock Morton on a month-long contract as cover for the injured Kevin Cuthbert. He made his competitive début in the Challenge Cup against Dumbarton on 26 July. At the end of his month-long deal, Halliwell was released before the transfer window shut allowing him to sign for another club at any time outwith the window. In the middle of November 2009, Halliwell signed for Forfar Athletic, subsequently moving to Partick Thistle in January 2010. In February 2011, having lost his place in the Partick team, Halliwell returned to his former club Clyde, on loan till the end of the season. He was released by Thistle at the end of the season. In August 2011, after 11 seasons in the senior ranks, the Englishman signed for Clackmannanshire Junior side Sauchie. On 20 August 2014, he signed a short-term contract with Hearts to provide emergency cover during a goalkeeping crisis.Bryn Comes In After a spell in the junior ranks with Gartcairn, Halliwell appeared for Forfar Athletic as a trialist on 11 March 2017 in a 2–1 defeat to Edinburgh City following a suspension to regular keeper Grant Adam.

Stephanie is known for her marriages to the famed fashion designer, Eric Forrester, and for her rivalries with Brooke Logan, who has been involved with Eric and her sons, Ridge and Thorne, and with competing designer Sally Spectra. Both of these rivals later became two of her closest friends. She has been portrayed since the show's inception in 1987 by Emmy-winning actress Susan Flannery. Stephanie's lung cancer diagnosis played a central role in the series, and the character died of the disease on November 26, 2012. http://soaps.sheknows.com/boldandbeautiful/news/id/29511/BandBs_Susan_Flannerys_Surprise_Salute_Video/ Casting and creation  The role of Stephanie was originally created for actress Susan Seaforth Hayes (Julie Olson Williams, Days of Our Lives) fame but, after Hayes turned it down, the producers contacted Hayes' former Days co-star, Susan Flannery, and she eventually won the role. Jane Elliot was contacted by producer Gail Kobe for the role but, lost to Flannery at the request of creator Bill Bell. Hayes did, however, appear in 2003 as Joanna Manning (Lauren Fenmore´s mother) in one episode. Stephanie has been played since the show's beginning in 1987 by Flannery, who, besides playing Stephanie, has also directed some of the show's episodes. In September 2007, Flannery asked the show for a medical leave, as she was suffering with fibromyalgia. Flannery, along with John McCook as Eric Forrester, Katherine Kelly Lang as Brooke Logan and Ron Moss as Ridge Forrester were referred to as the \\"Core four\\", having been still present on the series since the show's beginning. However, on August 11, 2012, it was announced that after twenty- five years, Moss would be leaving the show, thus breaking up the core four, leaving only Susan Flannery, Katherine Kelly Lang, and John McCook as the sole remaining characters from the show's inception. On October 10, 2012, it was announced that Flannery had made the decision to quit the show as well after twenty-five years. During an interview with TV Guide, Bradley Bell announced that Stephanie's character will be killed off after she loses her battle with cancer. Bell said: \\"It is huge. And amazing. I knew this day was coming but I've been in denial about it. I've been loving and treasuring every one of these last few days we have with Susan.\\"http://www.tvguide.com/News/Bold- Beautiful-Susan-Flannery-Exit-1054465.aspx Flannery signed a contract that would allow the show to build a storyline surrounding her exit. Stephanie last appeared on-screen via flashback on November 26, 2012, and video recording on December 7 and 10, 2012. On February 9, 2018, Flannery returned for a cameo as the voice of Stephanie on Brooke and Ridge's wedding day. Character development Bradley Bell said that Stephanie: \\"has always been a woman of great strength and character.\\" She is known for her long-running feud with Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang). However, in recent times, it has calmed down and they are extremely close. Bell has stated that: \\"Stephanie and Brooke are the true supercouple of B&B.;\\" During a confrontation with Brooke, Stephanie collapsed. On September 24, 2010, after being taken to the hospital, Stephanie was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. Brooke became the only person to know this secret; instead of \\"rejoicing\\" that her nemesis and arch- rival may soon be out of the picture, she became a confidant and motivator to Stephanie. At first, Stephanie refused treatment. Head writer and executive producer of The Bold and the Beautiful, Brad Bell, said that this was because she felt that her family and the family company (Forrester Creations) no longer needed her. Bell also said that \\"She'd rather die than be the center of attention.\\" When asked about the development of the storyline, Flannery said that the advice she offered head writer Brad Bell—having survived through colon cancer herself—was for Stephanie to keep her sense of humor while diagnosed with Cancer. Stephanie then created a goofy bucket list; Bell said that this was all a part of her denial, and wanting to focus on something else other than her cancer. In a second-level to the story, Stephanie meets a young woman, Dayzee Leigh (Kristolyn Lloyd) who gives her a new lease on life, and convinces her to undergo treatment. Dayzee lived on skid row in Los Angeles; Stephanie wanted to survive her cancer to advocate for poverty after learning more about it. Stephanie has since overcome her cancer. Prior, there was much speculation that Flannery was leaving the show, and that Stephanie would be killed off. During an interview with TV Guide in February 2011, she explained: The storyline not only raised awareness about cancer, it also raised awareness about the Union Rescue Mission through Dayzee's character. In 2012, she was diagnosed again, and according to Bell: \\"She receives the diagnosis that the cancer has spread and that there is no chance for survival.\\" Stephanie decided to throw a party which would be the last time she sees her loved ones. Storylines Stephanie Douglas Forrester is the matriarch of the Forrester fashion dynasty and the mother of five children: Ridge, Thorne, Kristen, Felicia, and Angela. Eventually her husband Eric Forrester became interested in other women such as Margo Lynley and his former college love, Beth Logan. Eric dated Beth years earlier in college but left her when Stephanie became pregnant. Eric found Beth catering a party one night and reconnected with her. Stephanie decided against an affair with gigolo Clarke Garrison, whom Stephanie had hired to date Kristen. Stephanie was also enraged when Ridge began romancing Beth's daughter Brooke. Stephanie had mysterious absences. It was revealed she was visiting a comatose brain damaged girl; It was Angela, the daughter Stephanie had, whom she said died at birth. The couple grew closer over Angela. However, it was revealed that the doctor hired an actress to play Angela to get money from the Forresters; and the real Angela had in fact died. The fake Angela escaped. Stephanie also had to deal with her warring sons, Thorne and Ridge, who were both in love with Caroline Spencer, Thorne's wife. Stephanie lost it when her other son, Thorne, got involved with Brooke. Stephanie terrorized Brooke at the Big Bear cabin with a fire poker before punching her and trying to strangle her. But Thorne proposed to Brooke, and Stephanie had a stroke. In the hospital, Stephanie again tried to choke Brooke. The stroke made Eric reevaluate his feelings for Stephanie, and he remarried Stephanie at her bedside. Brooke tried to make inroads with the wheelchair-bound Stephanie by massaging Stephanie's feet. Brooke and Thorne's ex-wife, Macy Alexander, were battling over Thorne and got into a car accident, where Macy died in an explosion. Macy's mother, Sally, exposed Thorne's continuing involvement with Brooke at Macy's funeral, and Stephanie suffered a second stroke. Stephanie softened toward Brooke a bit when Brooke gave Stephanie a photo album documenting Stephanie's life. Years before, Stephanie had forced teenaged Morgan DeWitt to abort Ridge's baby. Morgan came back and befriended Ridge's wife, Taylor, in a scheme to again carry Ridge's child. Morgan faked a series of e-mails between Ridge and Taylor to make it seem like Taylor gave Ridge \\"permission\\" to impregnate Morgan. After Taylor found out and Morgan lost the baby, Morgan kidnapped Taylor's daughter, Steffy Forrester, and imprisoned Taylor. Morgan escaped after Ridge rescued Taylor and Steffy, but showed up as a clown for a Forrester kiddie party. Morgan fell into the pool and Stephanie left her to drown, but later Morgan tried to drown Stephanie in her bathtub. Stephanie survived, and later mended fences with her daughter, Kristen, after Kristen got involved with the HIV-positive Antonio Dominguez. Massimo Marone, Stephanie's childhood friend and first love, came back to romance Stephanie, who wasn't interested. But when Ridge lost blood in an accident, it turned out that Ridge and Eric's blood types didn't match, and Massimo was revealed as Ridge's father. Stephanie hid the truth from Eric and Ridge. Meanwhile, Brooke, who couldn't have Ridge, had an affair with Deacon Sharpe, her daughter's husband. Stephanie was outraged, but later, Stephanie tried to help Brooke turn over a new leaf and even helped deliver baby Hope at the Big Bear cabin with Bridget. Stephanie and Massimo saved Amber after Sheila kidnapped Amber to make way for Sheila's daughter, Erica Lovejoy. But when Taylor died in an altercation with Sheila, Stephanie was devastated, and the repercussions included Ridge, who'd been told of his paternity by Massimo, considering a relationship with Bridget, which forced the issue of Ridge's paternity. Stephanie finally told Eric that Massimo was Ridge's father, and Eric walked out on her. Stephanie warned Jackie Marone to stay away from Eric, although Stephanie encouraged Jackie's son, Nick Marone, to be with Brooke, and arranged for Nick and Brooke to be stranded on an island together. After Sally and Stephanie, who had become friends, drowned their sorrows, a soused Sally gave Stephanie a sloppy haircut. For Christmas, Stephanie gave Sally a locket with both their pictures inside. Stephanie and Brooke bonded briefly when Ridge was believed to be dead. Later, when Thorne defected to Spectra, Stephanie apologized for having always played favorites with Ridge. Stephanie worried when Ridge claimed he had seen Taylor, but Taylor was indeed alive, having been spirited away from the hospital by Prince Omar, who healed Taylor in his palace and held her prisoner. Stephanie paid off a doctor and faked a heart attack to manipulate Ridge into returning to Taylor. The ploy worked, but when Brooke uncovered it, the entire Forrester family turned their backs on Stephanie. Stephanie was about to leave Los Angeles when she found papers in Eric's safe that said Stephanie was the true owner of Forrester Creations. When it came out that Eric had known about it for decades, Stephanie kneed Eric in the groin, fired him, and installed Thorne as president. Meanwhile, Bridget was hurt when Brooke moved on with Bridget's ex-husband, Nick. Stephanie responded by giving Brooke a gift-wrapped gun with which to shoot herself. Instead, Brooke fired at Stephanie, but missed. Stephanie was stunned when Eric remarried Brooke to keep her away from Nick. But Eric and Stephanie drew together and remarried for the sake of their daughter, Felicia, who had cancer. Felicia \\"died,\\" but Stephanie secretly forced an unconscious Felicia to have chemotherapy against Felicia's wishes, and the treatment was successful. The low point of the Forrester-Logan feud was when Stephanie convinced Ridge to go for full custody of Ridge Jr and Hope Logan. Stephanie was convinced that Brooke would get in bed with a guy because he was available and Brooke was easy. So after following Brooke Logan to a bar she told a stranger, Andy, Brooke was lonely and needed company. When the stranger seemed hesitant, Stephanie let it be known that Brooke was a girl from the Valley and revealed Brooke kept a house key under the doormat. Within a week Brooke was raped when Andy used the house key. Ridge dropped the custody case. When Eric, Ridge, and Brooke found out Stephanie's role in Brooke's attack, Stephanie left town, to coincide with Susan Flannery's medical leave. Stephanie came back to ask for forgiveness and everyone soon learned about Brooke being raped and Stephanie's hand in it. In the end, Stephanie would be shot at the end of Forrester Creations Fashion show by Storm Logan, who had suppressed years of anger and resentment toward his father for abandoning his family decades earlier. After Eric had an affair with Donna Logan he divorced Stephanie and married Donna then forced Stephanie out of Forrester Creations. Stephanie became a partner at Jackie M Designs. Stephanie attended the reading of the will of her good friend Bill Spencer. Bill's daughter Karen Spencer delivered a note that offered his respect to Stephanie over the years and asked that she mentor Karen just as she did Karen's twin sister Caroline. Stephanie enacted her revenge on Eric and Donna via a webcast titled The Logan Chronicles at Spencer Publications by working with Bill Spencer, Jr. Bill eventually took over Forrester Creations obeying his father's final wishes to avenge Stephanie. Ridge's daughter Steffy regained control of Forrester Creations by nearly seducing him and split the ownership between Ridge, Eric, Stephanie, and Taylor. Stephanie felt compelled to leave Jackie M and return to Forrester. Eric let Stephanie stay at the Forrester mansion, where she encountered Donna's mother, Beth, who was suffering from the latter stages of Alzheimer's disease. Stephanie and Beth had an argument at the Forrester pool that resulted in Beth drowning after Stephanie walked away. Donna wanted Stephanie arrested, a conflict which ended Donna and Eric's marriage and sent Eric back to Stephanie. Stephen tried to avenge Beth by seducing Stephanie's sister Pam into going off her medication. Stephen put a gun in Pam's hand and pushed for Pam to shoot Stephanie, but Stephanie got the gun away from Pam and shot Stephen instead. Stephanie fought for her granddaughter Steffy's marriage to Liam Cooper, who was revealed to be Bill Spencer, Jr.'s son, warning him to think carefully but to finally choose between Hope and Steffy. Eric was looking for a way to celebrate 50 years with Stephanie, so when Sally's old friend, Gladys Pope (Phyllis Diller), arrived as a gardener who could also perform marriages, Stephanie remarried Eric in an impromptu and very informal ceremony at the Forrester mansion. In October 2012, Doctor Lewis told Stephanie that her lung cancer has returned. Despite the desperate pleas of her family and friends, Stephanie refused to accept treatment; she decided instead that she would like to enjoy her final days. An Irish-themed party was thrown in her honor. She was last left under Brooke's care after saying good- bye to all her loved ones. On November 26, 2012, Stephanie lost her battle with cancer lakeside at Big Bear cabin after asking Brooke to sing her to sleep in her arms.

This can include tasks such as determining who is allowed to enter the market and/or what prices may be charged.Encyclopedia of Management, Pennsylvania State University, Gale, 2009, p. 31. The majority of financial markets such as stock exchanges are regulated, whereas over-the-counter markets are usually not at all or only moderately regulated. One of the reasons for regulation can be the importance of the regulated activity - meaning the harm suffered should the industry fail would be so fatal that regulators (governments, legislators) cannot afford the risk. This includes fields like banking or financial services. Secondly, it is common for some markets to be regulated under the claim that they are natural monopolies, or that a monopoly would very likely appear should there be no regulation. It is crucial to prevent misuse of monopoly power, as this can lead to delivery of poor services with very high prices. This includes for example the telecommunications, water, gas, or electricity supply. Often, regulated markets are established during the partial privatisation of government controlled utility assets. A variety of forms of regulations exist in a regulated market. These include controls, oversights, anti-discrimination, environmental protection, taxation, and labor laws. In a regulated market, the government regulatory agency may legislate regulations that privilege special interests, known as regulatory capture.  Changes in regulation  Regulation is subject to changes over time, due to both technological advances as well as the change in attitude towards regulation in general. An example for industries that are no longer regulated is the rail service or airlines in the US. On the other hand, there are also industries that did not need regulation in the past, but are in need of it now. This includes for example the real estate market. Another category are the markets that encountered major changes in regulatory approaches due to various crises. A prime example are stock exchanges following stock market crashes. The practice of regulating markets dates back centuries when ancient societies relied on standardised weights and measurements and practised punishment for theft and fraud. For the most part, market regulations have been imposed by the central governments and to a lesser extent by interest groups. One notable example of such interest groups is medieval guilds. They were associations of merchants and artisans that controlled the practise of their profession in their particular area. Guilds defined requirements for practising their profession, which usually meant that only guild members could practise their profession or sell their goods within their city. Since the beginning of the 20th century, labour groups at times have had regulatory roles in some markets.  Controversy  Generally, regulation is a very polarising issue. Those who are in favour of regulating usually see it as beneficial to the wider society. This has to do for example with regulations targeting ecological, racial, or religion related issues. On the contrary, those against regulation see it as a tool for lobbying or as a source for creating unfair competition, be it intentional or not. Some advocates of free market generally see any regulation except for the most essential ones as costly and inefficient.

He played all or part of seven seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), from 1983 to 1989, for the Houston Astros, Chicago White Sox, St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies, and Oakland Athletics. Dawley was used exclusively as a relief pitcher during his major league career, appearing in 275 games as a reliever.  Professional career   Reds farm system  Dawley was drafted out of Griswold High School in the seventh round of the 1976 Major League Baseball Draft by the Cincinnati Reds. Over the next six seasons, he worked his way up through the Reds' farm system as a starting pitcher, pitching substantially in relief only in 1980 with the Indianapolis Indians. During spring training in 1983, he was traded to the Astros along with infielder Tony Walker in exchange for backup catcher Alan Knicely.  1983: All-Star rookie  Dawley made the Astros roster out of spring training as a relief pitcher. Despite having little experience out of the bullpen, Dawley got off to a great start, being chosen for and playing in the All-Star Game after going 5–2 with a 1.88 earned-run average before the All-Star break. Dawley finished his rookie season with a 6–6 record and a 2.82 ERA and 14 saves. In the All-Star Game itself, Dawley took the mound for the National League with two outs in the bottom of the third inning after the American League's Fred Lynn hit the first grand slam in All-Star history off Atlee Hammaker. Dawley retired Jim Rice on a pop fly to end the third, then retired George Brett on a flyout and struck out Lance Parrish. After giving up a single to Dave Winfield, he got Manny Trillo to fly out to end the inning. Dickie Thon, his teammate with the Astros, then batted for him in the fifth inning.Jul 6, 1983, NL All-Stars at AL All-Stars Play by Play and Box Score  Remaining career  In 1984, Dawley set career highs in several categories, going 11–4 with a 1.93 ERA. However, he never again matched the success of his first two seasons. After slumping to a 5–3 record and a 3.56 ERA in 1985, he was released at the end of spring training in 1986. He signed with the White Sox, and although his ERA did bounce back slightly to 3.32, he failed to win a game, going 0–7 with 2 saves. During the next offseason, Dawley was traded to the Cardinals for infielder Fred Manrique. Dawley's numbers continued to decline as he posted an ERA of 4.47 while losing a career-high eight games against five wins, and he was left off the team's postseason roster. He was released by the Cardinals that winter, signing with the Phillies. He started the season with two losses in his first five appearances, posting an ERA of 17.05 before being sent to the minors in mid- May. He spent most of 1988 season with the minor league Maine Phillies before returning to the majors in September, but appeared in just three more games, then was released again. Prior to the 1989 season, Dawley signed a minor league contract with Oakland. He started the season with the Tacoma Tigers, where he earned a return trip to the majors by posting a 3–1 record with 3 saves and a 2.56 ERA along with 44 strikeouts in 38.2 innings pitched. On June 23, he threw four scoreless innings against the Toronto Blue Jays. On July 4, however, he gave up four runs in just two-thirds of an inning against the Kansas City Royals. He was returned to Tacoma, then released on July 27. He was signed by the Milwaukee Brewers the next day. He finished the season with their top farm club, the Denver Zephyrs and became a free agent after the season, ending his professional career.

In 2019 he was appointed Chair of the Edward James Foundation, which owns a large estate in the South Downs and runs West Dean College of Arts and Conservation . Between 2004 and 2019 he was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Roehampton in south-west London, where he was also Professor of Modern Literature. Life and career O'Prey was born in Southampton in 1956, the youngest of five children. He attended St George Roman Catholic Comprehensive School until the age of 16, when he transferred to King Edward VI School, Southampton, then a grant maintained grammar school. He won a place to study English Language and Literature at Keble College, Oxford. He obtained his PhD from the University of Bristol, where his supervisor was Charles Tomlinson. In 1977, O'Prey left Oxford University to work for the author Robert Graves at his home in Deia, Mallorca. Professor O'Prey assisted him in various ways, most notably working with Graves' wife, Beryl (died 2003), on the creation of a major archive of Graves's papers which is now housed at St John's College, Oxford. That work led him to publish a biographical study of Graves told through his letters with other eminent writers such as Siegfried Sassoon, T.S. Eliot and Gertrude Stein, published in two volumes: In Broken Images (Hutchinson, 1982) and Between Moon and Moon (Hutchinson, 1984). O'Prey's edition of Graves's Selected Poems (Penguin Books, 1986), published just after Graves's death in 1985, reinstated a number of poems which Graves himself had previously suppressed, including some of his youthful war poetry written during World War I. O'Prey's other books include First World War: Poems from the Front, published in 2014 by the Imperial War Museum, to coincide with the centenary of the war. It takes a new approach in focusing on a small number of poets who saw active service on the Western Front, including three women. O'Prey translated with Lucia Graves the first English translation of the Spanish nineteenth century classic novel, Los Pazos de Ulloa by Emilia Pardo Bazan (Penguin Classics, 1991, reissued 2013). The book was later serialised by Channel 4. O'Prey wrote the first full critical study of the novels of Graham Greene, and edited the Penguin edition of Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad (Penguin Books, 1983). He edited the first collection of poems by the American First World War nurse and novelist Mary Borden (Dare-Gale Press, 2015). His media appearances include BBC Two's War of Words: Soldier Poets of the Somme, broadcast in 2014 and a Channel 4 programme on drugs and art. Affiliations O'Prey has served on a number of bodies, the current or most recent of which include: Universities UK Board and Chair of the Longer Term strategy Group (2010–2019); the Edward James Foundation and West Dean College Trustee (2015–present), Froebel Trust Trustee (2013–19), Higher Education Funding Council for England Strategic Advisory Committee on Leadership Governance and Management (2005–11); Higher Education Careers Services Unit Board (2006–13); London Higher Board (2006–09); Sport England Higher Education Stakeholder Group (2008–present); Putney High School, Governor (2004–09); Editorial Board of Despatches, journal of the Imperial War Museum; the War Poets Association (Board member 2007–present; President 2007-13); and Worldwide Universities Network Academic Board (2002–04). Career Prior to joining the University of Roehampton as Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive when it gained independent university status in 2004, O'Prey spent 16 years at the University of Bristol, where he worked in a variety of capacities, latterly as Director of Academic Affairs. At Bristol he played a seminal role in the introduction of Entrepreneurship as an academic discipline and in the establishment of Enterprise and Knowledge Transfer as key themes in the University's mission. He played a key role in the development of the University's Research Strategy and Education Strategy, and in the development of initiatives to improve access to the University for students from non- traditional backgrounds. He was also warden of the University of Bristol hall of residence Goldney Hall until 2004. According to the University's website, during O'Prey's tenure as Vice-Chancellor, the University of Roehampton has adopted a strategy to establish a strong academic reputation. In 2014 Roehampton was ranked the most research intensive modern university in the UK, with two-thirds of research rated 'world leading' or 'internationally excellent'. Awards In 2011, O'Prey received honorary doctorates from the University of Bristol and Manhattanville College (New York). Honours O'Prey was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to higher education and the literary history of the First World War.

The district serves 13 communities: All of Anoka, Champlin and Coon Rapids, and parts of Andover, Blaine, Brooklyn Center, Brooklyn Park, Dayton, Fridley, Ham Lake, Nowthen, Oak Grove and Ramsey. The district's name refers to its geographic span over two counties: it covers the southern portion of Anoka County and the northeast part of Hennepin County. The district was formed in 1920 and in 1952 after dozens of small rural school districts voted to consolidate. The superintendent is Mr. David Law. As of the 2012–13 school year, it is the largest school district in Minnesota with an enrollment of 37,880, http://www.twincities.com/stpaul/ci_21828151/st-paul-replaces-anoka-hennepin- has-minnesotas-largest students in grades K–12. Additional students attend pre-k programs as well as adults who are earning a diploma or GED through the district's Adult Basic Education program. School Board Anoka-Hennepin is governed by a board whose members are elected to four-year terms. Allegations of tolerance of homophobic bullying and suicide controversies Between 2009 and 2011, nine students in Anoka-Hennepin committed suicide; the area is designated by state health officials as a \\"suicide contagion area.\\" Many of these students were gay or perceived by their classmates to be gay, leading to bullying. The district is the subject of a federal investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Office for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education over the climate of anti-gay harassment and discrimination based on sex, including peer-on-peer harassment based on not conforming to gender stereotypes. Anoka-Hennepin is in the congressional district represented by Tom Emmer. The district received criticism for its Sexual Orientation Curriculum Policy (Feb. 2009) because it stated that teachers should be neutral when addressing issues of sexual orientation in their classrooms. Critics said this \\"neutrality policy\\" prevented acceptance and open discussion of LGBT people and issues in schools, and was essentially a \\"gag order\\" on teachers.Birkey, Andy.

The Sexual Orientation Curriculum Policy stated teachers can address issues of sexual orientation in their classes provided the discussion is age-appropriate, fact-based and connected to the curriculum. In July 2011, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the National Center for Lesbian Rights filed a lawsuit against the district because of this policy. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of five current and former students who say that they were discriminated against because of their real or perceived sexual orientation and that teachers and district officials facilitated said violence and discrimination; a sixth student was added to the lawsuit a month later. On February 13, 2012, the policy was repealed and replaced by a vote of 5–1 with a new Respectful Learning Environment Policy. The former policy required district staff to \\"remain neutral on matters regarding sexual orientation,\\" while discussing such topics \\"in a respectful manner that is age-appropriate, factual, and pertinent to the relevant curriculum.\\" By comparison, the new policy states, \\"It is not the District's role to take positions on these issues. Teachers and educational support staff shall not attempt in the course of their professional duties to persuade students to adopt or reject any particular viewpoint with respect to these issues.\\" It states that such discussions, \\"shall be appropriate to the maturity and developmental level of students; be of significance to course content; and be presented in an impartial, balanced and objective manner, allowing respectful exchange of varying points of view.\\" Finally, the new policy states that, \\"In the course of discussions of such issues, district staff shall affirm the dignity and self-worth of all students, regardless of their race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex/gender, marital status, disability, status with regard to public assistance, sexual orientation, age, family care leave status or veteran status.\\"Respectful Learning Environment Policy [Official Text Pending Publication] Schools and facilities Elementary schools * Adams Elementary School * Andover Elementary School * Brookside Elementary School * Champlin Elementary School * Crooked Lake Elementary School * Dayton Elementary School * Eisenhower Elementary School * Evergreen Park World Studies Elementary School * Franklin Elementary School * Hamilton Elementary School * Hoover Elementary School * Jefferson Elementary School * Johnsville Elementary School * Lincoln Elementary School for the Arts * L.O.

Background In the public religion of ancient Rome, men and women of the social elite served as priests of the state cultus. Most priesthoods for men allowed the officeholder to lead an active political and military life as well; a few of the most archaic offices, such as that of the Flamen Dialis or high priest of Jupiter, served under strict religious prohibitions. Through interpretatio graeca and romana, the religions of other peoples incorporated into the Roman Empire coexisted within the Roman theological hierarchy. The cult of the Phrygian goddess Cybele, for instance, was imported from Galatia and integrated into Roman state religion as a result of the Second Punic War, at the end of the 3rd century BC. Six centuries later, as the Empire was becoming Christianized, the Calendar of Filocalus records the official observance of other international deities such as Isis. Individuals also might choose to undergo initiation into mystery religions such as the rites of Mithras, as a matter of private devotion. These forms of religious observance were not considered mutually incompatible. But just as pharaoh Akhenaten's monotheistic cult of Aten collided with the polytheistic traditions of Egypt, the Judeo-Christian insistence on Yahweh being the only God, believing all other gods were false gods, could not be fitted into the system. The spread of Christians, first looked on merely as Jewish schismatics, over most provinces and Rome itself, and most of all their scruples in refraining from the loyalty oaths directed at the emperor's divinity and their refusal to pay the Jewish tax,Historians debate whether or not the Roman government distinguished between Christians and Jews prior to Nerva's modification of the Fiscus Judaicus in 96. From then on, practising Jews paid the tax, Christians did not. Dunn, James D.G., Jews and Christians: The Parting of the Ways, A.D. 70 to 135, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing (1999), , Pp 33-34.; Boatwright, Mary Taliaferro & Gargola, Daniel J & Talbert, Richard John Alexander, The Romans: From Village to Empire, Oxford University Press (2004), , p. 426.;Wylen, Stephen M., The Jews in the Time of Jesus: An Introduction, Paulist Press (1995), , Pp 190-192. was perceived as a threat not just to the state cult, but to the state itself, leading to various forms of persecution. In the third century, the Church as such was made the object of attack. The emperor Decius (249 - 251) issued edicts that imposed hard restrictions on Christians, a policy continued by his successor Valerian. The accession of Gallienus (r. 253–268), however, ushered in a period of nearly 40 years with no official sanctions against Christians, which Eusebius described as the \\"little\\" peace of the Church. The Tetrarchy In 293 Constantius Chlorus, former Praetorian prefect, was appointed Caesar to Maximian. After his Mauretanian campaign, Maximian, in 299, returned to the north of Italy, living a life of leisure in palaces in Mediolanum (modern-day Milan) and Aquileia, and leaving warfare to his subordinate Constantius.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 16; Barnes, New Empire, 56. In 303, Diocletian (284-305) and the tetrarchy launched the last and bloodiest persecution, the enforcement of religious conformity being part of his program to restore stability and unity in the wake of the Crisis of the Third Century. The campaign was avidly pursued by Galerius, who noticed that Constantius was well-disposed towards the Christians, and who saw it as a method of advancing his career prospects with the aging Diocletian. Of the four Tetrarchs, Constantius made the least effort to implement the decrees in the western provinces that were under his direct authority,Southern, Pat. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine, Routledge, 2001, p. 168 limiting himself to knocking down a handful of churches. In May 305, Valerius Severus was appointed Caesar to Constantius, now Augustus of the western half of empire. According to Donald Spence Jones, Severus, under the direction of Constantius, gave up persecuting Christians in Italy and North Africa.Spence Jones, Henry Donald. Early Christianity and Paganism, A.D. 64 to the Peace of the Church in the Fourth Century, Cassell, limited, 1902, p. 440 As Constantius was dying in July 306, he recommended his son to the army as his successor;Potter, David Stone, The Roman Empire at Bay, AD 180-395, Routledge, 2004, p. 346 consequently Constantine was declared emperor by the legions at York. In 311, Galerius published an edict from Nicomedia officially ending the persecutions. Constantine's Edict Complete amnesty and freedom were attained two years later when Emperor Constantine, after defeating Maxentius, published early in 313 with his colleague Licinius the famous Edict of Milan by which Christians were guaranteed the fullest liberty in the practice of their religion. In addition to removing the ban from the Christians, Constantine ordered that the property of which they had been deprived during the persecutions by seizure or confiscation should be returned to them at the expense of the State. For the Christians the immunities and guaranties contained in this act had most important results. Then for the first time it became possible to observe publicly the liturgy in its fullness, and seriously and earnestly to attempt to mould the life of the empire according to Christian ideals and standards. The joy of the Christians at this change in their public status is admirably expressed by Eusebius in his \\"Church History\\" (X, ii). Other uses The term \\"Peace of the Church\\" is also applied in England and Ireland to the end of persecution that followed the Acts of Catholic Emancipation (1778-1926); in Germany, after the Kulturkampf.

It appears as the closing track on their 1971 album Sticky Fingers. Recording and composition \\"Moonlight Mile\\" was the last song recorded for Sticky Fingers. Recording took place during the end of October 1970 at Stargroves. The song was the product of an all-night session between Jagger and guitarist Mick Taylor. Taylor had taken a short guitar piece recorded by Richards (entitled \\"Japanese Thing\\") and reworked it for the session. Jagger performs the song's prominent acoustic guitar riff. Jagger felt it easier to extemporize with Taylor, as Richards was not present. It was Taylor's idea to add a string arrangement by Paul Buckmaster to the song. Jim Price—the Rolling Stones' usual trumpeter—plays piano. Taylor claims he was promised some songwriting credit, but found himself surprised that he did not when the song was released on Sticky Fingers. Richards and Jagger took credit for the song. The lyrics are elliptical and mysterious, but touch on the alienation of life on the road: Reception Many consider \\"Moonlight Mile\\" one of the Rolling Stones' most underappreciated ballads. In a review of the song, Bill Janovitz says, \\"Though the song still referenced drugs and the road life of a pop-music celebrity, it really is a rare example of Jagger letting go of his public persona, offering a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the weariness that accompanies the pressures of keeping up appearances as a sex-drugs-and-rock & roll star.\\" Rock critic Robert Christgau said the song, \\"re-created all the paradoxical distances inherent in erotic love with a power worthy of Yeats, yet could also be interpreted as a cocaine song.\\"Christgau, Robert. \\"The Rolling Stones\\".

It was meant to be about coming down from a cocaine high. However, Mick Jagger later dismissed any suggestions of the song being an allegory for drug use, and stated \\"The feeling [he] had at that moment was how difficult it was to be touring and how [he] wasn’t looking forward to going out and doing it again.

Both were abolished after protests, in 2000 and 2006 respectively.  Origins  The system of bonded labour existed in Nepal since the 18th century; following the unification of Nepal, members of the ruling elite received land grants in the Terai and were entitled to collect revenue from those who cultivated the land. The Kamaiya system bonds males to labour, and the Kamlari system bonds females.  Kamaiya system   Kamaiya history  Traditionally, people without land or work could get loans from landowners allowing them to sustain a minimum livelihood. In exchange to this, they had to live and work on the landowner's land as quasi slaves. Exorbitant debts were charged, and whole families were forced to slave labour for years and even generations, bonded by indebtedness to the landowner and bonded by unequal social relations to sell labour in lieu of the loan taken. Following the eradication of malaria in the Terai region in the 1950-60s, the large influx of hill migrants marginalized traditionally landowning Tharu people by occupying their lands. While the Tharus had no records of the land they were cultivating, the settlers registered the land in their name, forcing the Tharus to work as agricultural labourers. The customary practice of obtaining a \\"helping hand for family business\\" was gradually replaced by the forced labour system called Kamaiya, which in Tharu parlance is tantamount to hardworking hired farm labour. The Kamaiya system existed in particular in western Nepal and affects especially the Tharu people and Dalits.  Kamaiya abolition  Increasing protests against the kamaiya system, organized by the \\"Kamaiya movement\\", led to its abolition in 2000. On 17 July that year, the Government of Nepal announced the Kamaiya system be banned, all Kamaiyas be freed and their debts be cancelled. Although most Kamaiya families were freed, the system has persisted. Many Kamaiyas were evicted by their former landlords and released into poverty without any support. Others received land that was unproductive. To alleviate the poverty of the affected people – the main cause of the system – rehabilitation and distribution of land were promised to ex-Kamaiya families. To put action behind the attempts to discuss the land issue with the government, the ex-Kamaiyas started occupying land in Kailali and Bardiya districts in the winter of 2005-06. But a decade after being liberated, the freed Kamaiyas are forced to live a very difficult life as the government has still not fulfilled its promises of providing a proper rehabilitation and relief package.  Kamlari system   Practice  In its modern form, girls and young women are sold by their parents into indentured servitude under contract for periods of one year with richer, higher-caste buyers, generally from outside their villages.  Campaigns for kamlari abolition  Several activist groups including the Nepal Youth Foundation (NYF) and the Friends of Needy Children (FNC) have campaigned for abolition of the system since 2000, and worked to free kamlaris by paying off their parents' debts. On 10 September 2006, the Supreme Court of Nepal affirmed that this practice known as kamlari was illegal, and that former kamlaris were entitled to governmental compensation, education and rehabilitation. However, the interim- government of Nepal (formed during the last stage of the Nepalese Civil War following the successful April 2006 revolution against the autocratic monarchy) failed to comply with the Supreme Court's ruling, and the practice continued to exist. Anti-kamlari organisations launched new campaigns and protests to demand the government to comply, which in 2009 resulted in financial compensation for freed kamlaris. The system was still not abolished, however, and thousands of girls served forcefully for several more years. Various charitable organizations have mitigated the kamlari practice by offering grants larger than prospective masters to families who promise not to sell their daughters, as well as funds for the girls' education. The next year the Freed Kamlari Development Forum (FKDF) was formed by former slave girls with the help of NYF and FNC. The suspicious death 12-year-old kamlari Srijana Chaudhary in March 2013 revived the movement and saw mass protests taking place to demand the practice's immediate end. After images of police hitting the protesting girls were seen in national and international media, outrage against the Nepalese government soared. In June 2013, the government finally gave in and officially abolished the kamlari system and agreed to a 10 point plan involving compensation, rehabilitation and justice for victims of abuse.  Post-abolition practice  Despite the 2013 official prohibition on putting girls into indentured servitude, the NYF estimated in October 2017 that hundreds of girls were still living in slave-like conditions, many in the homes of prominent politicians and businessmen.

They quickly enlarged the hotel and renamed it the Royal Bath Hotel because the Prince of Wales had stayed there in 1856. Civic activities Russell-Cotes was elected to the Board of Commissioners in 1883 and fought hard to enhance the town's reputation as a health resort. He called for a direct railway link from Brockenhurst to Bournemouth to avoid having to change trains at Ringwood. He also campaigned for 'Undercliff Drive' to enable invalids to take a carriage drive beside the sea. When Bournemouth became a borough in 1890, he presented the mace—a replica of that presented to Wolverhampton by Queen Elizabeth I. Mayor of Bournemouth Russell-Cotes was offered the mayoralty in 1893 but declined it due to temporary ill health. He became mayor in 1894. East Cliff Hall When Undercliff Drive opened in 1907, it was announced that Annie and Merton wanted to give their recently completed home, East Cliff Hall, and its contents to the people of Bournemouth. Russell-Cotes amassed a large collection of works of art and curios. Those donated to the town are displayed in the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum, Bournemouth's principal museum, which is located in East Cliff Hall and is named in his honour. He was a friend of the actor, Sir Henry Irving, who stayed with him on several occasions. Freedom of the Borough The Russell-Cotes were granted the Freedom of the Borough of Bournemouth in 1908.

It has rough, finely fibrous bark on the trunk and larger branches, smooth bark above, lance-shaped or curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of eleven or more, white flowers and cup-shaped, hemispherical or conical fruit.juvenile foliageflowersfruit Description Eucalyptus dives is a tree that grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. The bark on the trunk and larger branches is rough, finely fibrous and greyish and smooth grey on the thinner branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves arranged in opposite pairs, egg-shaped to heart-shaped or curved, long and wide and sessile. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, lance-shaped to curved, the same slightly glossy or dull green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are usually arranged in groups of eleven or more in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to club-shaped, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from September to January and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped, hemispherical or conical capsule, long and wide and sessile or on a pedicel up to long with the valves near the level of the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus dives was first formally described in 1843 by Johannes Conrad Schauer and the description was published in Walpers' book Repertorium Botanices Systematicae (Volume 2). The specific epithet (dives) is a Latin word meaning \\"rich\\" referring to the rich oil content of the leaves. Distribution and habitat Broad-leaved peppermint usually grows in poor, dryish soils in open forest and woodland, usually in poor, shallow, stony soils in higher places. It is found in New South Wales south from Niangala in New South Wales and in south-eastern Victoria. Uses Essential oils This eucalypt is a source of Eucalyptus oil and yields up to 12.75% by weight of partly dried leaves. Some forms of E. dives contain mostly the essential oils phellandrene and piperitone, some also contain eucalyptol and the remainder eucalyptol, terpineol, geraniol and citral. In the early post-war years there was a shortage of menthol and several manufacturers were able to produce this oil from piperitone but gradually this method was displaced by production of the oil from Mentha arvensis. The form rich in cineole is still harvested in New South Wales while the seeds imported into Africa are mostly from the piperitone/phellandrene form.

The village comprises fewer than 30 dwellings, two farms and the parish church. There are no shops and few local facilities in the village. The village has only been accessible by car via a single narrow lane since the through route was cut off in the late 1960s by the building of the Bournemouth Spur Road (A338). There is no public transport. Although the village itself has always been small, the civil parish at one time included the greater part of what is now Bournemouth. The civil parish was subsumed into Bournemouth County Borough in 1931, but a new civil parish called Holdenhurst Village was created on 1 April 2013. However, the ecclesiastical parish still exists; it encompasses Hurn, East Parley and Bournemouth International Airport, as well as the Townsend and adjacent areas of Bournemouth.Map of Holdenhurst parish Etymology Holdenhurst is recorded in the Domesday Book as Holeest suggesting an etymology of Old English holegn meaning \\"holly \\"and hyrst meaning \\"grove, wood\\", giving a meaning of \\"wood where holly (Ilex aquifolium) grows. In succeeding centuries it was spelt Holeherst (12th century), Holhurst (13th century), Hollehurst (14th century), Holnehurst (15th century), Holnest (16th century) and Holnirst (17th century).'The liberty of Westover: with Holdenhurst and Bournemouth', A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 5 (1912), pp. 133-37. Date accessed: 17 March 2007. Early history The location of Holdenhurst on the edge of the flood plain of the lower Stour valley made it an ideal location for early farmers. There have been a large number of archaeological finds in the area including coins of the Durotriges tribe of Celtic Britain, and Roman coins have also been discovered making it likely that the Romans also settled in the area.History of the Saxon Village of Holdenhurst - Location and Settlers The hundred of Holdenhurst existed in 1176, but was soon extended and became known as the hundred of Christchurch; with that part west of the Stour (the original hundred of Holdenhurst) being known as the district of West Stour, or Westover. By 1263, however, the hundred of Christchurch with Westover had again become known as the hundred of Holdenhurst.'The hundred of Christchurch: Introduction', A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 5 (1912), pp. 81-2. Date accessed: 17 March 2007. 19th and 20th centuries Although there were many boundary and name changes over the years, even by the start of the 19th century the parish of Holdenhurst (also known as the Liberty of West Stour) encompassed the whole area between Christchurch in the east and Poole in the west. The area was still a remote and barren heathland, and much of it was common land used by the inhabitants for livestock and by the poor for wood and turves.The 1802 Inclosure of The Liberty of West Stour In 1802, however, the Christchurch Inclosure Act, entitled An Act for dividing, allotting and inclosing certain Commonable Lands and Waste Grounds within the Parish or Chapelry of Holdenhurst in the County of Southampton was passed in Parliament. Commissioners were appointed to divide up the land and allot it according to an individual's entitlement, and to set out the roads and to sell plots of land in order to pay for their work. In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Holdenhurst like this: :HOLDENHURST, a village and a parish in Christchurch district, Hants. The village stands on the river Stour, 3 miles NW of Christchurch r. station. The parish contains the tythings of Redhall, Moordown, Charminster, Stronden, Great Dean and Little Down, Muccleshell, Muscliffe, and Throop; extends to the coast: and is all included in Christchurch borough.A Vision of Britain Through Time: Holdenhurst Hampshire.

Only nine completed LPs are known to exist on this label - as well as one unfinished album by Smith Casey in 1963 which did not reach the release stage. The rarity of this label is compounded by the fact that most LPs on the label were only issued as limited editions (99 copies), which makes it difficult to locate any of them.

The episode first aired in the United States on October 7, 1994 on Fox. The episode was written by supervising producer Howard Gordon, and directed by Rob Bowman. \\"Sleepless\\" earned a Nielsen rating of 8.6 and was viewed by 8.2 million households. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder is assigned a new partner, Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea). The two investigate a case where doctors and marines who were part of a sleep deprivation experiment are being killed off. \\"Sleepless\\" featured what would become the recurring character of Alex Krycek, portrayed by Nicholas Lea. Krycek would progress from Mulder's partner to one of his enemies. Howard Gordon, the episode's writer, was inspired by various cases of insomnia. During the first season, Chris Carter had written a similar themed episode, but stopped working on it when he became \\"unhappy\\" with the result.  Plot  In New York City, Dr. Saul Grissom finds a fire outside his apartment. Firefighters arrive and evacuate the building. One man who is being evacuated has a distinctive horizontal mark on the back of his neck; as he is being evacuated, he looks up at Grissom's apartment and smiles knowingly. The firefighters find no fire or any related damage, but discover Grissom's lifeless body in his apartment. Fox Mulder anonymously receives a tape cassette of Grissom's 9-1-1 call. He tries to take the case, only to learn that another FBI agent, Alex Krycek, has opened it first. Deciding to leave Krycek out of the loop, Mulder calls Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and asks her to conduct Grissom's autopsy. Mulder then heads to Grissom's clinic in Stamford, Connecticut, where he is confronted by an angered Krycek. The two travel back to Quantico to see Scully, who says that Grissom's body showed no signs of a fire, but yet seems to have biologically believed it was burning. Meanwhile, in a Brooklyn apartment, Vietnam veteran Henry Willig is approached by a fellow ex-Marine, Augustus Cole. Suddenly a group of wounded Vietnamese appear and gun him down. Examining Willig's corpse, Mulder and Krycek find a scar on his neck and realize he was in the Special Forces stationed in Vietnam in 1970, and one of only two survivors, the other being Cole. They head to the VHA hospital in New Jersey where they discover that Cole was discharged, despite the fact that his doctor does not remember doing so. Mulder meets a mysterious informant named \\"X\\", who gives him information on a secret military project that Grissom performed where he eradicated the need for sleep through lobotomy. X provides him with the name of Salvatore Matola, a squad member who was mistakenly reported as killed in action. A man matching Cole's description robs a drug store. Mulder and Krycek arrive, but not before two gunshots are heard from the room where Cole is believed to be. It appears that the two officers in the room with him shot each other. Cole escapes. Mulder believes that Cole's years of sleeplessness have provided him with illusionary abilities. Mulder and Krycek meet with Matola soon afterwards, who says that he has not slept in twenty-four years due to the experiment. He reveals that there was another doctor who was part of the squad, Dr. Girardi, and that he was the one who actually performed the lobotomies. Mulder and Krycek head to a subway station, where Dr. Girardi is expected to arrive for Grissom's funeral. Mulder sees Cole there, and Cole seems to shoot Girardi, but this is shown to be in Mulder's head. In reality, Cole has captured Girardi and holds him hostage, about to show him a similar fate as his other victims. By searching surveillance footage, the agents track his location and find Girardi wounded. Mulder finds Cole, who is ready to kill himself. Krycek, believing Cole is holding a gun instead of the Bible he is actually holding, shoots him, and Cole dies of his wounds. Mulder and Scully find both of their files on the case missing. Krycek reports to the Smoking Man and others, telling them that the dissolution of the X-Files and the separation of Mulder and Scully has been ineffective, and their determination is only stronger. He also notes that Scully is a bigger problem than they anticipated.Lowry, pp. 169–170Lovece, pp. 114–116  Production  thumb Writer Howard Gordon was initially inspired to write this episode based on insomnia he was suffering at the time. Gordon, who wrote many episodes with Alex Gansa in season one made his solo writing debut with this episode. Originally Chris Carter had written a script for the first season, which shared the same theme as \\"Sleepless.\\" The original conceit for Carter's episode was \\"What makes the perfect soldier?\\" He also liked the twist on sleep, noting that \\"sleep is where demons are released in our dreams.\\" He explained that the characters in \\"Sleepless\\" were haunted by their memories in real life because they were not able to sleep. Carter sees this episode as one of his favorites. This episode marked the first appearance of Nicholas Lea as Alex Krycek. Carter had much interest in Krycek, because he replaced Dana Scully as Mulder's new partner. Lea had previously appeared as a different character in the first season episode, \\"Gender Bender.\\" Bowman, who had directed \\"Gender Bender,\\" thought that Lea \\"was a [...] strong choice for a fresh-out-of-Quantico FBI agent.\\" When creating him, the writers always had in mind that he would be a recurring character, while they agreed if the character did not work they would kill him off. \\"Sleepless\\" marked the first on screen appearance of Steven Williams as Fox Mulder's new source, \\"X.\\" The character was originally intended to be a woman, and an actress was cast in the role, but after shooting her first scene the role was recast with Williams, an actor who had previous experience with writers Glen Morgan and James Wong.Lovece, p. 116 Natalija Nogulich, the actor who originally earned the role, was replaced because the writing staff felt she was not able to create the \\"right chemistry\\" between her co-stars.Rabwin, Paul.

We had a good cast; Tony Todd was wonderful\\"Edwards, p. 98 and saying it was \\"beautifully directed by Rob Bowman. Entertainment Weekly rated \\"Sleepless\\" with a B+, considering that Tony Todd's performance \\"elevates a just-good story into a great one.\\" John Keegan Critical Myth gave the episode 7 out of 10, saying it was best remembered for its introduction of Alex Krycek. The web site further stated that the episode was decent and was a \\"fairly standard exploration\\" for the early season episodes. Dave Golder from SFX named the episode one of the \\"20 TV Sci-Fi Gamechangers\\" due to its introduction of Krycek. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five.Shearman and Pearson, pp. 34–35 The two noted that Gordon was able to make \\"the cliche of Vietnam war guilt\\" feel \\"very personal and even sorrowful.\\" However, Shearman and Pearson noted that the revelation of Krycek as an enemy was \\"the biggest shame\\" in the episode. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club wrote that, while the episode is \\"your standard MotW riff\\", it is important because it features the on-screen introduction of both Krycek and X.

Hinds is a jewellery retailing chain, operating in England and Wales. There are currently 116 F Hinds stores within the United Kingdom. History Beginnings (1856-1990) The chain is an independent retailer which was founded in 1856 by George Henry Hinds, although his father Joseph was also a clockmaker in Stamford, Lincolnshire and his great uncle was also a Stamford clockmaker in the early years of the 1800s. Shortly after the First World War, brothers Frank and William divided the business in two. William Hinds diversified into theatres and also into films as he was one of the two founders of Hammer Film Productions, the studio famous for horror films. Frank continued with the jewellery business and eventually, in 1990, F. Hinds took over the one remaining shop owned by the other half of the family in Worthing, Sussex. Unlike most companies established 150 years ago, the sixth and seventh generations of the Hinds family still own and manage the business. Diamond buyer Andrew Hinds is personally responsible for selecting the diamonds sold by the company. He is a fellow of the Gemmological Association of Great Britain. Brands operated by F. Hinds include My Diamonds diamond jewellery, the Night and Day black and white diamond collection and the Kilimanjaro Tanzanite collection. Opening of online store (1997-2005) The chain was one of the first click and mortar jewellers, having launched its first e-commerce site in 1997. Its online store www.fhinds.co.uk has operated since. F. Hinds stores stock a wider than average range of jewellery, watches, clocks, collectables and gift ranges . They are usually to be found within shopping centres, or on High Streets. The stores can be found in many towns and out of town malls. They provide a comprehensive design and repair service and also specialise in recycling unwanted gold jewellery into new pieces, offering over 100% of the value of the gold exchanged.  RJC Certification (2008-2018) In 2008, F Hinds joined the Responsible Jewellery Council, the international not-for-profit organisation established to reinforce consumer confidence in the jewellery industry by advancing responsible business practices throughout the supply chain, and in August 2011 they were one of the first members to become fully accredited following an independent audit. In 2014 Andrew Hinds was elected Chairman of the UK jewellery trade body the National Association of Goldsmiths.  Acquisition of Chapelle Jewellery (2019-present)  In 2019, Hinds Ltd purchased the UK's leading outlet centre specialist, Chapelle. Chapelle had traded successfully for several decades but had struggled under Hilco which lead to its eventual administration; however, Hinds saved 12 of the stores. The outlet centre stores continue to operate under the Chapelle brand name.

It ran from August 2, 1972, to June 18, 1981, often devoting space to counterculture and alternative politics of the early '70s. The offices were in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

An agreement was reached within two weeks, without Barnes' reinstatement. Soon afterwards, the staff was informed of the purchase of the paper – its name and goodwill – by Stephen Mindich, owner of the more established (and more commercial) competitor Boston After Dark. Hoping to eliminate his direct competition. Mindich renamed his paper The Boston Phoenix After Dark, later shortened back to The Boston Phoenix. The entire former staff of The Phoenix was now unemployed, the lone exception being the late sportswriter George Kimball, who went to work for Mindich.https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1972/9/18/boston- now-has-two-new-weeklies/ Because of the solidarity developed before and during the strike, the Cambridge group decided to continue publication as The Real Paper (by implication, \\"The Real Phoenix\\") and organized themselves as an employee-run cooperative.https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1972/8/1/phoenix- rises-from-ashes-staff-issues/x-Phoenix staffers join to publish The Real Paper, Joe Pilati, July 31, 1972 Bob L.

Though no capital was ever invested, The Real Paper cooperative became self-sustaining within several months. Two years of growth followed, accompanied by some employee turnover. Notable hires included reporters Joe Klein, Bo Burlingham, Anita Harris,http://brokenpatternsbook.com/about/anita-harris/ Burt Solomon and Ed Zuckerman, the late movie critic Stuart Byron, and columnists Kay Larson, aka Nora Lasky (art), and Mark Zanger (food, as \\"The Red Chef\\"), and music writers James Miller and Dave Marsh. As freelancers, the noted civil rights attorney Harvey A. Silverglate wrote on legal matters; Lita Lepie, author of the murder mystery Black Lotus, wrote one of the country's first Lesbian columns under the pseudonym Lilith Moon; movie critic Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote about classical music, among other subjects; Fred Hapgood covered science.http://fhapgood.fastmail.fm/ Eventually, however, the strains of operating as a worker-owned firm without having learned how to handle cooperative management led to staff divisions. Published accounts of the split include one in the Harvard Crimson.https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1975/5/7/crawling-out-of-the- snakepit-at/ Another appeared in a 1983 book, Life and Death on the Corporate Battlefield, by former editor Solman and former Managing Editor Thomas Friedman. Le Anne Schreiber, writing in The New York Times (January 3, 1983) discussed and quoted from the book's chapter on the paper's early history; :Lessons emerge from case histories of actual companies and individuals. Although it is told without hand-wringing, the saddest of these stories is what happened to the staff of The Real Paper...Lines were drawn, and suddenly everybody was a close friend of somebody who was now the enemy of another close friend. :In a traditional organization, the conflicts that arose would have been solved by firings or resignations; but at The Real Paper, which had been set up as an egalitarian business – with every employee holding an equal number of shares as long as he or she worked for the paper – there was no way to settle or to escape internal conflict. The fact that the paper had become profitable meant that no one wanted to leave and relinquish shares; but by staying together, given the bitter factionalism that had developed, the staff insured that the paper would become progressively less profitable.\\"Books of the Times,\\" The New York Times, January 3, 1983. Journalists, authors and others Ad from The Real Paper (June 13, 1973). The Real Paper served as a springboard for many prominent journalists, authors and members of the music industry.

Landau wrote: :But tonight there is someone I can write of the way I used to write, without reservations of any kind. Last Thursday at the Harvard Square theatre, I saw my rock and roll past flash before my eyes. And I saw something else: I saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen. And on a night when I needed to feel young, he made me feel like I was hearing music for the first time.Campbell, Michael and Brody James. Rock and Roll: An Introduction. Schirmer G Books, 2007. pp. 326 :When his two-hour set ended I could only think, can anyone really be this good; can anyone say this much to me, can rock'n'roll still speak with this kind of power and glory? And then I felt the sores on my thighs where I had been pounding my hands in time for the entire concert and knew that the answer was yes. :Springsteen does it all. He is a rock'n'roll punk, a Latin street poet, a ballet dancer, an actor, a joker, bar band leader, hot-shit rhythm guitar player, extraordinary singer, and a truly great rock'n'roll composer. He leads a band like he has been doing it forever. I racked my brains but simply can't think of a white artist who does so many things so superbly.Musician Guide: Bruce Springsteen Biography Between the lines In 1975, The Real Paper was purchased by Ralph I.

It is endemic to New Zealand, where it is generally found on the sea floor at a depth of . Seldom exceeding in length, this species has a thick, oval pectoral fin disc and a short, stout tail with a single dorsal fin. It is blind, as its tiny eyes are covered by skin. Its pelvic fins are divided in two, with the anterior portion forming a limb-like appendage. These appendages likely allow the ray, which may not be able to swim at all, to \\"walk\\" along the bottom. The claspers of adult males extend beyond the disc. Polychaete worms are known to be part of its diet, and its reproduction is aplacental viviparous. It can produce an electric shock for defense. The International Union for Conservation of Nature presently lacks the data to assess its conservation status. Taxonomy The oval electric ray was described by William John Phillipps of the Dominion Museum, in a 1929 volume of the New Zealand Journal of Science and Technology. The type specimen was collected off Island Bay, Wellington. A specimen of this ray had been illustrated earlier by Augustus Hamilton, in his 1909 description of the related T. aysoni. Hamilton obtained the specimen at the fish market at Dunedin and made note of its different shape, but did not recognize it as a distinct species. Along with T. aysoni, this species may also be called the blind electric ray. Distribution and habitat Confusion between the two Typhlonarke species has led to uncertainty regarding the extent of the oval electric ray's distribution. Both species are found off the eastern coast of New Zealand, between the East Cape of North Island and the Snares Shelf south of South Island, including the Cook and Foveaux Straits and the Stewart and Chatham Islands. Bottom-dwelling in nature, this species is generally found at a depth of but has been recorded from as shallow as and as deep as . Description The oval electric ray differs in disc shape from the related T. aysoni. The pectoral fin disc of the oval electric ray is ovoid in shape, tapering smoothly towards the rear, and has a very thick margin. The eyes are minute and located beneath the surface of the skin; though not visible externally, their positions are marked by small white patches. The spiracles follow the eyes and are oval with smooth rims. The nostrils are closely together, with their outer rims curled to nearly form tubes and their inner rims expanded and fused together into a fleshy skirt-shaped curtain, that nearly conceals the small, deeply recessed mouth. The teeth number 11 rows in either jaw and are arranged with a quincunx pattern to form narrow plates restricted to the front of the jaws. The teeth in the back have a single sharp cusp, while those at the front are worn down and blunt. There are five pairs of short, curved gill slits, with the first and fifth pairs smaller than the others. Each pelvic fin is divided: the anterior portion is formed into a long appendage resembling a finger, while the posterior portion is merged smoothly with the pectoral fin to form part of the disc. The trailing margins of the pelvic fins join the body evenly, without a notch. Adult males have cylindrical claspers that extend past the disc margin. The single dorsal fin has a rounded margin and originates just ahead of where the disc margin meets the body. The tail is short and thick, with faint lateral skin folds running along the sides, and ends in a nearly circular caudal fin. The skin is completely smooth. The oval electric ray is dark brown above, lightening towards the disc margins and on the underside. The area around the mouth and nostrils, and the underside of the pelvic appendages, are white. This species can grow to long, but most do not exceed . Biology and ecology Thick and flabby with a rudimentary tail, the oval electric ray seems virtually incapable of swimming. Instead, it likely relies on its mobile pelvic fin appendages, which are better developed than those of T. aysoni, to push it along the bottom. Like other electric rays, it can produce a defensive electric shock from a pair of kidney-shaped electric organs placed on either side of its head. Each organ consists of 180-200 relatively large, fluid- filled hexagonal columns, which essentially act as batteries connected in parallel. The oval electric ray is sightless and captures prey via suction; it is known to feed on polychaete worms. It is aplacental viviparous, with females bearing litters of up to 11 pups. The newborns measure long. Human interactions The oval electric ray is susceptible to capture in bottom trawls, and the presence of major commercial fishing activity within its range may merit concern. However, given insufficient data the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Data Deficient. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the oval electric ray as \\"Not Threatened\\" with the qualifier \\"Data Poor\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

The original station was built by the Philadelphia, Newtown and New York Railroad in 1893 and burned in 1905. It was replaced with a station that was moved from Huntingdon Valley, further down the Newtown Branch. That station was demolished in 1971. A cinder 'platform' was used as a flagstop by both the Reading Railroad and SEPTA Regional Rail. SEPTA closed the station and several others in 1983 when train service was suspended. History George School Station was a stop on the Reading Railroad's Newtown Line. The Philadelphia, Newtown and New York Railroad built the station as an inducement for the George School founders to choose this site, originally the Worth Farm, over 3 others in final consideration. The PN&NY; also offered to haul all the building materials for the Main building, shown in the background of the photo below, at their cost, as an additional incentive. There was also a passing siding and a coal trestle at the site. The stone piers for the trestle still remain, although the tracks and steel supports were removed during the 1960s. The PN&NY; was later absorbed into the Reading Railroad system. It later became a part of SEPTA's Fox Chase Rapid Transit Line. The station, and all of those north of Fox Chase, was closed on January 18, 1983 due to failing diesel train equipment. In addition, a labor dispute began within the SEPTA organization when the transit operator inherited 1,700 displaced employees from Conrail. SEPTA insisted on utilizing transit operators from the Broad Street Subway to operate Fox Chase-Newtown diesel trains, while Conrail requested that railroad engineers continue to run the service. When a federal court ruled that SEPTA had to use Conrail employees in order to offer job assurance, SEPTA cancelled Fox Chase-Newtown trains. SEPTA must use Conrail workers rather than its own personnel to run trains over the region's 13 commuter lines, a special federal court has ruled in a decision that offers some job assurance for 1,700 Conrail employees next year. The special court, in an opinion issued Wednesday, ruled that SEPTA had acted legally in October when it replaced Conrail workers with its former subway operators on the line. Service in the diesel-only territory north of Fox Chase was \\"temporarily suspended\\" at that time, and George School station still appears in publicly posted tariffs.SEPTA Tariff No. 154; effective July 1, 2009 Although rail service was initially replaced with a Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus, patronage remained light, and the Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus service ended in 1999.newtownline.pa-tec.org/history References External links *Newtown Line.pa-tec.org – PA-TEC study on resuming SEPTA commuter service between Fox Chase and Newtown *George School website Railway stations in the United States opened in 1905 Railway stations closed in 1983 Former SEPTA Regional Rail stations Former Reading Company stations Railway stations in Bucks County, Pennsylvania 1905 establishments in Pennsylvania 1983 disestablishments in Pennsylvania Former railway stations in Pennsylvania ","title":"George School station"},{"id":"6390729","text":"U.S. Route 15 (US 15) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that runs from Walterboro, South Carolina to Painted Post, New York. In Virginia, the U.S. Highway runs from the North Carolina state line near Clarksville north to the Maryland state line at the Potomac River near Lucketts. US 15 is a major north-south highway through the Piedmont of Virginia, connecting Clarksville and Farmville in Southside Virginia with Culpeper, Warrenton, and Leesburg in Northern Virginia. Route description Clarksville to Farmville US 15 enters Mecklenburg County, Virginia at the North Carolina state line several miles south of Clarksville. The U.S. Highway continues south toward Oxford and the Research Triangle. US 15 heads north as two-lane National Highway, which parallels the Virginia Southern Railroad north across the Grassy Creek branch of Kerr Lake. The U.S. Highway expands to a four-lane divided highway in an industrial area adjacent to Marks Municipal Airport. US 15 passes through a partial cloverleaf interchange with the US 58 bypass, then becomes an undivided highway on entering the town of Clarksville as College Street and crossing over the rail line. The U.S. Highway turns east onto Virginia Avenue, which also carries US 58 Business and SR 49. After passing through the Clarksville Historic District, US 15, US 58 Business, and SR 49 leave the town of Clarksville by crossing the John H. Kerr Reservoir, an impoundment of the Roanoke River that is also known as Buggs Island Lake, on the Phillip Saint Julian Wilson Bridge and a causeway. The bridge, which contains lights underneath used for nighttime fishing, includes a brief passage through Halifax County due to the thalwegs of the Roanoke and Dan Rivers, which were used to set the county boundaries, converging just south of Clarksville. At the east end of the causeway, access to US 58 is provided at a four-way intersection. Ramps to US 58 west and US 58 east form the southern and eastern legs of the intersection, which mainline US 58 avoids via a pair of flyover ramps just east of its bridge over the reservoir. US 15 and SR 49 turn north, cross over the Virginia Southern rail line, and parallel the eastern shore of the lake until the two highways split at the hamlet of Dortch Store. US 15 heads north, crossing the Bluestone Creek arm of the reservoir and entering Charlotte County, where the road becomes Barnesville Highway. The U.S. Highway intersects SR 92 (Jeb Stuart Highway) at Barnes Junction and US 360 (Kings Highway) at Wylliesburg.

US 15 meets the southern end of SR 20 (Constitution Route) then passes through the town of Dillwyn as Oak Street and Main Street. The U.S. Highway parallels the Buckingham Branch Railroad out of town and passes through the community of Alpha, where the highway passes by Buffards Mountain and veers away from the railroad. After passing through Arvonia, the highway crosses the James River at New Canton on the John H. Cocke Memorial Bridge. The bridge passes over the Buckingham Branch Railroad on the south side of the river just south of its bridge across the river to join CSX's Rivanna Subdivision, which parallels the north bank of the river through the hamlet of Bremo Bluff. US 15 continues north through the Fluvanna County communities of Weber City and Fork Union. The U.S. Highway becomes concurrent with SR 6 (River Road) adjacent to Fork Union Military Academy. The two highways diverge at Dixie, from which US 15 passes through Carysbrook. The highway meets the eastern end of SR 53 (Thomas Jefferson Parkway) just south of the U.S. Highway's crossing of the Rivanna River into Palmyra. US 15 passes through Wildwood and Hunters before intersecting US 250 (Three Notch Road) at Zion Crossroads at the Fluvanna-Louisa county line.

US 15 continues north along the edge of the Green Springs National Historic Landmark District to its intersection with SR 22 (Louisa Road) at Boswells Tavern. The U.S. Highway meets US 33 (Spotswood Trail) just south of Gordonsville. The two highways run together north onto Orange County and the town of Gordonsville, where the highways parallel CSX's Piedmont Subdivision along Martinsburg Avenue. US 15 and US 33 veer onto Main Street and pass the Exchange Hotel at their underpass of the Washington Subdivision, the Charlottesville-Orange rail line owned by the Buckingham Branch Railroad. US 15 leaves Main Street at the Gordonsville Roundabout; US 33 and SR 231 head northwest as Main Street, SR 231 heads southwest along Gordon Avenue toward Cismont, and US 15 heads northeast along Gordon Avenue, which becomes James Madison Highway at the town limit. North of Gordonsville, US 15 expands to a four-lane divided highway that parallels the Washington Subdivision and the eastern flank of the Southwest Mountains, and passes Gordonsville Municipal Airport. The U.S. Highway becomes an undivided highway and passes the historic home Mayhurst at the southern limit of the town of Orange, where the highway becomes Caroline Street. US 15 meets SR 20 (Berry Hill Road) and runs concurrently with the state highway as a two-lane street under Norfolk Southern Railway's Washington District. SR 20 continues north on Caroline Street while the US 15 veers northeast onto four-lane Madison Road, which intersects SR 20 Business (Main Street) before leaving Orange as a two-lane road. US 15 crosses the Rapidan River into Madison County and meets the eastern end of SR 230 (Orange Road) at Madison Mills. The U.S. Highway passes through Five Forks, home of the Woodberry Forest School. North of Locust Dale, US 15 crosses the Robinson River and its tributary Crooked Run; at the latter stream, the U.S. Highway enters Culpeper County. The highway passes to the west of Cedar Mountain and meets the southern end of SR 299 (Madison Road) before reaching a diamond interchange with US 29 (James Monroe Highway), where US 15 Business continues north into the town of Culpeper. Culpeper to Maryland US 15/US 29 northbound at SR 793 north of Warrenton US 15 and US 29 run concurrently as a four-lane divided highway around the east side of Culpeper, where the highways cross over the Washington District rail line and meet US 522 and SR 3 (Germanna Highway) at a diamond interchange. US 15 and US 29 pass under the rail line and meet the northern end of US 15 Business and US 29 Business at a partial cloverleaf interchange. The highways parallel the Washington District through Brandy Station and by Culpeper Regional Airport to the town of Remington, where the road crosses the Rappahannock River into Fauquier County. US 15 and US 29 pass to the north of the town, which is directly served by US 15 Business and US 29 Business (James Madison Street). Immediately north of the northern junction with the business routes, US 15 and US 29 meet the southern end of SR 28 (Catlett Road), which follows the rail line toward Manassas. US 15 and US 29 become concurrent with US 17, which heads southeast as Marsh Road toward Fredericksburg, at Opal on their way to Warrenton. South of the town, the U.S. Highways' respective business routes split northwest and the U.S. Highways bypass the town on a freeway to the east. US 15, US 17, and US 29 have a diamond interchange with SR 643 (Meetze Road/Lee Street) before reaching a directional interchange where US 17 diverges from the other U.S. Highways toward Winchester and US 15 and US 29 receive their business routes. US 15 and US 29 head northeast as Lee Highway, which passes through New Baltimore and intersects SR 215 (Vint Hill Road) just west of Buckland, where the highways enter Prince William County cross Broad Run. Just east of the county line, US 29 continues east as Lee Highway toward Washington while US 15 turns north onto two-lane James Madison Highway. US 15 northbound between SR 600 and SR 615 in southern Loudoun County US 15 continues north through Haymarket, where the highway expands to a four- lane divided highway immediately south of its intersection with SR 55 (John Marshall Highway). The U.S. Highway passes through a diamond interchange with I-66 and runs through a suburban area between Catharpin to the east and the Bull Run Mountains to the west. At Woolsey, US 15 meets the northern end of SR 234 (Sudley Road) and reduces to two lanes. North of Bull Run, where the road enters Loudoun County, the highway passes through a pair of roundabouts at Gilberts Corner. US 15 meets US 50 (John Mosby Highway) at the second roundabout. The U.S. Highway runs along the east flank of the Bull Run Mountains as it passes James Monroe's estate of Oak Hill just south of the Little River and Oatlands Plantation in the community of Oatlands at its crossing of Goose Creek. At Virts Corner east of Hogback Mountain, US 15 enters the town of Leesburg as South King Street. At SR 7 (Leesburg Bypass), US 15 Business continues straight into the downtown area while US 15 joins the eastern side of the four-lane divided bypass. US 15 and SR 7 meet the western end of SR 267 (Dulles Greenway) at a trumpet interchange before the two highways diverge at a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 7 Business (Harry Byrd Highway) that contains a flyover ramp for westbound SR 7. US 15 reduces to two lanes shortly before it meets the northern end of US 15 Business (North King Street) west of Ball's Bluff Battlefield and National Cemetery. Just north of the business route, the highway intersects SR 655 (Whites Ferry Road), which serves White's Ferry, the last remaining ferry crossing of the Potomac River that connects Leesburg with Poolesville, Maryland. US 15 passes by the historic homes Rockland and Temple Hall and through the community of Lucketts, which is home to the historic Lucketts School. North of Lucketts, the U.S. Highway veers to the west and runs along the eastern flank of Furnace Mountain. The road meets SR 672, which provides access to Lovettsville, before crossing the Potomac River on the Point of Rocks Bridge, a camelback truss bridge, into the Maryland village of Point of Rocks. History US 15 generally follows the Old Carolina Road, which connected North Carolina (at what was then North Carolina Highway 75) with Frederick, Maryland through Virginia. It was added to the state highway system in 1918 as State Route 2 and renumbered State Route 32 in the 1923 renumbering. In 1926, US 15 was designated along the whole of SR 32. The SR 32 designation was dropped in the 1933 renumbering, and was immediately reused on another route south of Petersburg. The number was again reused on its current alignment in the early 1940s to match North Carolina Highway 32. From June 2013 to February 2014, the Virginia Department of Transportation converted the existing interchange between US 15 and I-64, in Zion Crossroads, to a diverging diamond (DDI), the first in the state, with final construction completed by mid-April 2014. A similar interchange between US 15 and I-66 was completed in January 2017.

It was released in the US as Those Fantastic Flying Fools, in order to capitalise on the success of Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines two years earlier. Director Don Sharp shot second unit on Magnificent Men. Plot summary In Victorian England, everyone is trying to make new scientific discoveries, including such failures as the Duke of Barset's attempt to create the first house in England illuminated by electricity (leading to its going up in flames), Sir Charles Dillworthy's suspension bridge (which falls apart directly Queen Victoria cuts its inaugural ribbon) and, in Germany, Siegfried von Bulow's powerful new explosive (which is intended to require only a minute quantity)'s disastrous recoil. In the US, meanwhile, when Phineas T. Barnum's \\"Greatest Show on Earth\\" burns to the ground, he heads to England with his star, Tom Thumb. Barnum and Thumb are invited to a scientific lecture by Von Bulow who proposes the idea of sending a projectile to the Moon using his powerful new explosive. Von Bulow is ridiculed, but Barnum thinks the idea has the potential to make him money. He sets about finding the financial backing in order to build a giant cannon to fire the projectile, carrying a reluctant Tom Thumb. The project attracts investment from all over the world; however, the spaceship designed by Sir Charles Dillworthy proves useless since it does not provide a means for returning to Earth. Barnum then meets an American aeronaut, Gaylord Sullivan, who has run off with his girlfriend, Madelaine, on her wedding day to another man, the wealthy Frenchman Henri. Upon arriving in Wales and meeting Barnum, Gaylord claims that he has designed a projectile equipped with round-trip rockets. Henri offers to finance Gaylord's missile if he agrees to take Tom Thumb's place. Meanwhile, Dillworthy and his shady brother-in-law, Harry Washington-Smythe, who have already embezzled most of Barnum's funds, immediately plot to sabotage Gaylord's flight in order to win large wagers on the failure of the moonship expedition. When Madelaine discovers their plan, she is kidnapped and taken off to Angelica's Home for Wayward Girls. She escapes, however, and arrives back at the launching pad, located on a mountain in Wales, just as Gaylord is being removed from the sabotaged moonship. Dillworthy, Washington-Smythe, and a Russian spy, Bulgeroff, sneak into the spaceship to continue their sabotage. Bulgeroff pulls the takeoff lever, and the three men are sent soaring on a one-way trip. They land in what is presumably barren wasteland to find inhabitants singing in Russian. The befuddled Washington-Smythe can only conclude that the Russians are already on the Moon; Washington-Smythe and Dillworthy find themselves as part of the Burlak work brigade hauling barges under the knout of the foreman [Bulgeroff].

The film was originally announced as going to star Bing Crosby as Phineas T. Barnum and Senta Berger, along with Terry-Thomas, Gert Fröbe and Wilfred Hyde-White. AIP said it would be a \\"wild adventure laced with comedy.\\" In the end Lionel Jeffries replaced Hyde-White and Burl Ives and Daliah Lavi stood in for Crosby and Berger. The film was almost entirely shot in Ireland starting 6 August 1966. The rocket launch was shot at the site of a disused copper mine in Avoca in Co.Wicklow, other exterior scenes were shot in the sand dunes of Brittas Bay, and the interior scenes were shot at Ardmore Studios, just south of Dublin.IMDb: Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon, Filming Locations Linked 2014-03-01 Director Don Sharp who had made several films for the producer Harry Alan Towers recalled that the film was Towers' most expensive. Attempting to obtain more funds for the projected US$3 million budget, Towers approached several international film studios who planned to release the films in their home countries; Constantin Film in West Germany, Anglo-Amalgamated in Great Britain and American International Pictures in the United States of America. In exchange, each of the film studios provided funds with the provisos that their national stars of Gert Fröbe, Terry-Thomas and Troy Donohue received more screen time expanding the originally much tighter screenplay. Release British Release During production, the film was known as Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon, but when it was screened by the British censors on 21 February 1967, it was registered as Rocket to the Moon (unusually, it was presented to the BBFC by the producer, Harry Towers, instead of the distribution company, which indicates that no distribution deal had been struck at the time).BBFC: Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon (1967) Linked 2014-03-01 However, by the time it was released, on 13 July 1967, it was once again known as Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon.

US Release In the United States, the film was first released by American International Pictures in Los Angeles on 26 July 1967 as Those Fantastic Flying Fools,AMPAS Index to Motion Picture Credits: Those Fantastic Flying Fools Linked 2014-03-02 in order to capitalise on the success of Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965), which also starred Terry- Thomas and Gert Fröbe, and where the director Don Sharp was responsible for the aerial sequences. However, it wasn't the hit that the distributors expected, so it was cut down to 95 minutes and released as Blast-Off elsewhere in the US – but that version was no success either. The Los Angeles Times said the film had a \\"leisurely, not to say soporific pace... it takes its time which is risky in a slapstick enterprise. Still it does retain an easy sauntering tone of amiable nonsense, with enough pratfalls and explosions to keep the small fry happy.\\" The New York Times said \\"it's all been done before, and better, but there are still some smiles.\\" See also First Men in the Moon (1964 film) References External links   1967 films 1960s science fiction films British science fiction films British films Films about space programs Films based on French novels Films based on works by Jules Verne Films directed by Don Sharp Films set in the 19th century British alternative history films Cultural depictions of P.

It is situated between Boscombe and Christchurch, in the unitary authority of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole. The area was previously known as Stourfield. Strictly, Southbourne refers to the area near to the coast; areas further inland are West Southbourne, Tuckton and Wick. History Southbourne was the creation of Thomas Armetriding Compton, an enterprising young physician, who set up general practice in Bournemouth in 1866 and could see the area's potential as a health resort. Prior to his arrival the clifftop land here had been part and parcel of Tuckton Farm, Southbourne being founded precisely where the piggeries had stood.A. McKinstry, The Village of Tuckton, 35,000 BC - 1926 (Christchurch: Natula Publications, 2015, ), p. 21. This area of clifftop land was purchased by Compton in 1871 and was later developed by the Southbourne- on-Sea Freehold Land Company, founded in 1882 with Compton as principal shareholder. Some older properties did exist on the outskirts of the area. Around 1766, for instance, Edmund Bott had built a Georgian mansion to the east of Pokesdown village, commanding views of Christchurch Harbour; he named it Stourfield House. One of the most celebrated inhabitants of Stourfield House was Mary Eleanor Bowes, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne, a notorious eccentric who used to set places for her pet dogs at the dinner- table. Stourfield House later became a care home, mainly for servicemen who had been injured in the Great War. Today only the front steps survive, leading to a block of flats in Douglas Mews; the steps are marked by a Blue Plaque. The original, extended building was demolished in 1990. Southbourne also had a short-lived pier. It was built by Compton's company in 1888 at a cost of £4,000 and was 300 feet long. There were regular boat-trips between the pier at Southbourne and the pier at Bournemouth. Unfortunately the pier, promenade and nearby sea wall built by Dr. Compton (to rival the resort at Bournemouth) were heavily damaged by storms in December 1900 and January 1901. A buyer for the pier was unable to be found and it was eventually demolished in 1909 due to public safety concerns. On 11 July 1910, Britain’s first international aviation meeting was held on a specially laid out aerodrome consisting of a mile of grassland between Tuckton and the \\"Double Dykes\\" near Hengistbury Head. Aviators from around the world competed in a variety of contests, including spot landing, altitude tests, and speed trials (both for the fastest and slowest circuit).Bournemouth’s flying circuses  Dorset Life - The Dorset Magazine Charles Stewart Rolls, co-founder of Rolls-Royce and pioneer aviator was killed on the second day of the meeting, while attempting a precision landing.Hengistbury Head from the Romans to the 20th Century The event was Britain’s earliest fatal flying accident involving a powered aircraft. Today Southbourne is a more relaxed, but still bustling locale for tourists keen to escape the busier areas of Bournemouth town centre, although the number of guest houses in the area has declined in recent years. The main area of Southbourne is Southbourne Grove, a long shopping street that has some unique and individual shops rather than high street chain shops. Another local centre is Southbourne Crossroads, which is further east towards Hengistbury Head. Seafield Gardens is a public open space which has, since 2001, won a Green Flag Award; it offers various outdoor facilities, including bowls and tennis. It also features a watertower. The easternmost part of the area is called Hengistbury Head. Southbourne's primary attraction is its sandy Blue Flag beach, which provides a quieter retreat from the more crowded beach along the coast at Bournemouth. Between the clifftop coastal road and the promenade and beach is the Fisherman's Walk Cliff Railway, a funicular railway that provides very easy access to Southbourne beach, and from where it is possible to reach the beaches at Boscombe and Bournemouth. In recent years there has been an increase in the construction of apartment buildings and holiday homes near the sea, examples including the Saltaire Building which was constructed in the early 2000s.

Primarily, high-quality music is made available to purchase, access and play back using software on the Apple Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, set-top boxes and mobile devices from an available distribution point, such as a computer host or server located at a telephone, cable TV or wireless data center facility. In 1992, computer modem speeds were limited to less than 28 thousand bits per second (28 kbit/s), compared with uncompressed music on compact disc (CD) that required 150 thousand bytes per second. As a result, additional bandwidth is required to accommodate delivering audio at CD quality standards: 16-bit frame, 44.1 kHz sampling rate, stereophonic (two channel audio). This prompted telephony, CATV, cellular and satellite providers to consider changing standards, assisting in creating the information superhighway, in terms of building higher capacity for existing telecommunications infrastructures. Early attempts at designing and developing music-on-demand technology, in accordance with the laws of the United States such as the Home Recording Act of 1992, include Access Media Network (AMN) by inventor Dale Schalow. Schalow, born in Virginia, was an independent audio engineer and programmer in Los Angeles, California, who helped record albums and music scores for David Bowie, Tin Machine, Cypress Hill, House of Pain, Beastie Boys, Interscope, and Warner Brothers. A multiplexed music-on-demand model was deployed using PCM audio sampling devices, Apple IIci, the KERMIT computer file transfer protocol, and SCSI storage systems by Schalow to validate processing 16-bit multi-channel audio from point-to-point in a professional recording studio environment, including his own independently operated Dascha company and 38 Fresh Recordings. The model conceived was introduced by Schalow to Apple Computer in 1992 after he submitted an entry into the \\"I Changed the World\\" contest, essentially describing how an Apple computer helped shape and change the world forever based upon its usage. Apple acknowledged the \\"Accessible Music Network\\" (AMN) by awarding Schalow Honorable Mention and sending him a simple gray T-shirt with the Apple logo on it. Stand-alone software created by AMN for consumer-based access was then developed for the Microsoft Windows computer operating system, as well as set-top box design prototypes conceptualized with 3D prototype imaging that required a telephone connector located next to a coaxial cable TV connector to converge low speed data uplinking with high speed downloading interactive communications. Presently, music-on-demand is still the center of controversy with a focus on illegal music downloading, peer-to-peer file swapping and the lag of legislation for rapidly changing technology on the Internet. Record labels represented by the RIAA, as well as publishers and songwriters, have vigorously defended copyrighted materials and have been successful in enforcing current laws for protecting their intellectual property. As of 2006, the new music industry has seen a rapid growth in overall revenues for legal digital music sales that has resulted in hitting and surpassing one billion dollars annually.

They are usually considered to be safer than vaccines from bacterial cultures. Creating vaccines synthetically has the ability to increase the speed of production. This is especially important in the event of a pandemic. History The world's first synthetic vaccine was created in 1982 from diphtheria toxin by Louis Chedid (scientist) from the Pasteur Institute and Michael Sela from the Weizmann Institute. In 1986, Manuel Elkin Patarroyo created the SPf66, the first version of a synthetic vaccine for Malaria. During the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, vaccines only became available in large quantities after the peak of human infections. This was a learning experience for vaccination companies. Novartis Vaccine and Diagnostics, among other companies, developed a synthetic approach that very rapidly generates vaccine viruses from sequence data in order to be able to administer vaccinations early in the pandemic outbreak. Philip Dormatizer, the leader of viral vaccine research at Novartis, says they have \\"developed a way of chemically synthesizing virus genomes and growing them in tissue culture cells\\". Phase I data of UB-311, a synthetic peptide vaccine targeting amyloid beta, showed that the drug was able to generate antibodies to specific amyloid beta oligomers and fibrils with no decrease in antibody levels in patients of advanced age. Results from the Phase II trial are expected in the second half of 2018.http://www.bioworld.com/content/alz-players-stand-united-new-beta- bids-also-fall References External links *Article on synthetic Hib vaccine *CRISP Thesaurus entry on Synthetic Vaccines *Web Health Centre: History of Vaccines Vaccines Synthetic biology ","title":"Synthetic vaccine"},{"id":"6390804","text":"Anthony Fleming is an American actor who is probably best known for his role as Trumpets on Fox's television series Prison Break.

Early life Sullivan was born on 15 June 1788, the son of John Sulivan (1749 –1839), of Richings Park, Iver, Buckinghamshire, the second son of Benjamin Sulivan of Cork (1720–67), Clerk of the Crown for Waterford and Cork [Kinsman of Laurence Sulivan, Chairman and Director of the East India Company] and Lady Henrietta Hobart, daughter of George, 3rd Earl of Buckinghamshire and sister of Robert, Lord Hobart, one of Pitt's Secretaries of State. He was christened 7 July 1788 – St. Georges Hanover Square. He came out to India as a writer with the EIC at age 15 and was appointed the Collector of Coimbatore in 1817, India. He married Henrietta Cecilia Harington, a daughter of Rev. William Harington (1768–1821) and of Anne Collet (1772–1820) on 2 February 1820 in Madras. John Sullivan is best known as the founder of the British settlement at Ootacamund. But he never became the Governor of Madras Presidency. Expedition to Nilgiris In 1819, he set out to explore the Nilgiris after obtaining an order from the British East India Company charging him with investigating the \\"origin of the fabulous tales that are circulated concerning the Blue Mountains to verify their authenticity and to send a report to the authorities\\". With a detachment of Europeans and Madras sepoys, he set out on his mission on 2 January 1819. The journey involved crossing rough and harsh terrain, ascending steep precipices and risking danger from wild animals. After an expedition that lasted for six days and the loss of the lives of some of the expedition members, Sullivan finally reached a plateau from where he proudly hoisted the British flag. After touring the area in 1819, John Sullivan began a personal campaign to persuade the government of Madras that the location's \\"unusually temperate and healthy\\" climate made it ideal as a \\"resort of invalids,\\" primarily soldiers. In 1821 the Medical Board of the presidency ordered three assistant surgeons to investigate these claims. Their reports persuaded the Board that \\"we fully anticipate very great advantages from a resort to these Hills,\\" and it recommended that fifty invalid soldiers be sent there to test the region's salubrity. Independently, Sullivan and other officials from neighbouring districts established summer residences at Ootacamund, in the heart of the Nilgiris. This nascent community soon attracted a stream of visitors in search of health, comfort and leisure. Colony of Ooty Memorial of John Sullivan in Kotagiri Sullivan was driven by a spirit of innovation and enterprise. He was the first to introduce horticulture in the Nilgiris. Potato, barley and other \\"English\\" agricultural products are some of the crops he introduced. In 1822, John Sullivan, began construction of his residence, called the 'Stonehouse', on property he had purchased from the Todas. His wife, who had the distinction of being the first European woman in the Nilgiris, moved into the house in 1823 along with his infant son and others who made Ooty their abode including Sir Thomas Munro, the governor of Madras, who stayed at Ootacamund. The Ooty Lake was created between 1823 and 1825 by Sullivan as a source of irrigation. Years later. He explained to his superiors: \\"the climate is particularly salubrious, and I rejoice to say my health has derived infinite benefit from my residence in it.\\"[9] This retreat quickly became a magnet for invalided officers and other Europeans in upper India seeking rest cures. Considering the age in which he lived, his attitudes towards the local population were remarkably progressive, arguing that the native people should be allowed to govern their own affairs. He also held that the Toda tribe had total proprietary rights over the Nilgiris, which set him at odds with East India Company officials. By 1828 there were some 25 houses, not to mention churches and the housing of immigrants from the plains. This was also the year when Ooty was made a military cantonment. Sullivan's dream of making it a sanatorium for British troops had been fulfilled, but the Government's action meant that Ooty would no longer be in his control but in that of his rival Major William Kelso. But Sullivan wasn't through with Ooty. After he finished his tenure as Collector of Coimbatore, he returned in his capacity as the Senior Member of the Board of Revenue of the Madras Presidency. Return to England Grave of wife Henrietta and daughter Harriet in Ooty In 1838, Sullivan's wife and daughter died within weeks of each other. John Sullivan's wife's and daughter's funeral were held at the St. Stephen's church and the graves can be seen even today. A grieving Sullivan left the hill station which he dearly loved and developed and returned to England with his eight children. He died 16 January 1855 and was buried in the churchyard of St Laurence, Upton-cum-Chalvey, Berkshire, where his grave may still be seen. The west window of the church is a memorial to him. The grave is shared by Frances, his second wife (1799–1876). Legacy The first house which Sullivan built at the village Hosatti, near Kotagiri, is currently the only memorial left in the Nilgiris save for the font donated in his name to St. Stephen's Church by Col. & Mrs. Gilhlan in 1872. The house is known as the \\"Sullivan's Bungalow\\" and is located in a village called Kannerimukku, near Kotagiri town. Sullivan contributed to the diversified commercial crops in the region, introducing potatoes and other European vegetables to the local community at that time to Badagas and Kotas, and played a very important role in developing the district as well as its headquarters – Ootacamund [now called Udhagamandalam, in short Ooty] which is an important Hill Station. Under Sullivan's influence local roads, a market, and such civic buildings as a courthouse, a hospital, a post office, a bank and a jail arose. He also played an important role in developing the economy of several local tribes. John Sullivan is regarded with great respect by the locals even today, for his contribution to the district of the Nilgiris (also known as the Blue Mountains}. His son, Henry Edward Sullivan, also became a Collector at Coimbatore and is noted in the memoirs of Madame Helene Blavatsky whom he entertained at Ooty in 1869.TAT Foundation, vol. 2. A second son, Augustus William Sullivan, also served in the Madras Civil Service, born in 1813; he died in 1858 and is buried at St. John's Cemetery in Tellicherry.

The musical style of the group is called kalindula, a distinctive Zambian popular style with traditional African roots. Chali died 30 May 2003, but the band has continued with Fraser Chilembo as their leader. Amayenge has received worldwide attention from WOMAD in London to Asia and the Americas.

It flows into the English Channel at Bournemouth, taking its name simply from Middle English bourn or burn, a small stream, and giving it to the town at its mouth. The Bourne comprises two main tributaries totalling just over of waterway; of this total length is culverted and is open stream. Its drainage catchment is some , about 70% of which lies within the Borough of Poole. The stream is fed from a number of sources but there is little documentary evidence and the actual origins of some are unknown. The head of the stream consists of three culverts emerging from below Ringwood Road; it is believed that one drains Canford Heath, one is fed from the Bournemouth and West Hampshire Water works at Francis Avenue and the third is supplied by road run-off. After flowing across Alderney Recreation Ground the stream is culverted for and re-emerges at Coy Pond Gardens. The stream is also fed by natural seeps and flushes, and there are 62 documented surface water discharges to the watercourse. In the upper reaches, the catchment boundaries are approximately defined by Ringwood Road to the west, Wallisdown Road to the north and Ashley Road/Poole Road to the south. In the lower reaches, the catchment width gradually narrows towards the outfall at Bournemouth Pier. The overall fall between the highest levels in the upper catchment to the Poole Bay outfall is approximately , giving an overall gradient of approximately 1:100 which is considered to be steep. Reaching Bournemouth, it flows through public gardens, known as the Upper, Central and Lower Gardens. It goes underground at The Square (which divides the Central Gardens from the Lower Gardens) and again just before it reaches the beach immediately east of Bournemouth Pier, so that its mouth is no longer visible.

Description and outcome  Despite having far fewer troops than the Soviets, the Finnish forces (12th Division) repelled the Red Army because the Soviets were only prepared to proceed along roads. The Kollaa area had very few roads, all of them guarded by Finnish troops; and the Soviets were not able to proceed cross-country without skis. Finnish military leaders of the battle of Kollaa. Kollaa is often considered to have been one of the most difficult places to defend during the Winter War. It has been estimated that the Red Army fired almost 40,000 artillery rounds at the defence line during a single day, whereas the Finnish artillery could fire only 1,000 rounds per day at the very most. Although the Finnish 12th Division stopped the 8th Red Army, with both sides suffering heavy losses, the Battle of Kollaa continued until the end of the Winter War. The Red Army managed to penetrate the Finnish defence line in Kollaa several times, thus pushing the Finns out of their positions, but the Finns systematically counter-attacked to restore the integrity of their defence line. The Finnish defence came close to collapse at the very end of the war; in fact, the Soviets managed to form a 0.5–1.5 kilometre deep fracture point in the Finnish defence line on March 12. As a result, the commander of the 12th Division of the Finnish Army considered abandoning the main defence line at Kollaa. However, as the news from the sector was that the situation was \\"not yet that alarming\\", the commander ordered a counter-attack for the defence line to be retaken the following day. As the news of the concluded peace treaty then reached the front, those orders were cancelled and the men were told to hold their current positions until the end of hostilities.  New expression of Finnish resolve  A famous quote from the Battle of Kollaa is Major General Hägglund's question, \\"Will Kollaa hold? (Kestääkö Kollaa?)\\", to which Lieutenant Aarne Juutilainen replied, \\"Kollaa will hold (Kollaa kestää), unless the orders are to run away.\\" The simple question and reply have entered Finnish lexicon as an expression of perseverance and resolve in the face of impending difficulty or crisis. The Finnish punk band uses the name.  The \\"White Death\\"  The legendary Finnish sniper Simo Häyhä, nicknamed the \\"White Death\\", served on the Kollaa front. He is credited with only 200 confirmed kills according to Finnish military records. The true number may amount to 800 kills in total.

The design history file, or DHF, is part of regulation introduced in 1990 when the U.S. Congress passed the Safe Medical Devices Act, which established new standards for medical devices that can cause or contribute to the death, serious illness, or injury of a patient. Prior to this legislation, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) auditors were limited to examining the production and quality control records of the device. Requirements The regulation requires medical device manufacturers of Class II and Class III devices to implement design controls. These design controls consist of a development and control plan used to manage the development of a new product, and a design history file where these activities are documented. These controls are specifically intended to manage a medical device company's new product development activities. Research and development processes aimed at developing new underlying technologies are not subject to these regulations. The requirements for a DHF are documented in FDA Regulation CFR 21 820. Design controls Each manufacturer of either a class II or class III medical device (as well as a select group of class I devices) needs to establish and document procedures on the design and design requirements. These design controls include: Also available in hardcopy, as *Design input - Design inputs are typically the initial requirements that describe the medical device to be produced. *Design output - Design outputs are the results of the design and engineering efforts. These are normally the final specifications for the device. Including the manufacturing process and the in-coming, in-process and finished device inspection, measurement or test methods and criteria. The outputs are normally documented in models, drawings, engineering analysis and other documents. The output needs to be directly traceable to the input requirements. Design verification and validation should demonstrate that the final output specifications conform to the input requirements and meet user needs and intended uses. *Design review - The design review is a formal review of the medical device design by representatives of each design function participating in the design efforts as well as other interested parties (e.g. marketing, sales, manufacturing engineering, etc.). The design review must be documented in the DHF and include review date, participants, design version/revision reviewed and review results. *Design verification - Design verification is the process that confirms that the design output conforms to the design input. Design verification should demonstrate that the specifications are the correct specifications for the design. Design verification must be documented in the DHF and include the verification date, participants, design version/revision verified, verification method and verification results. *Process validation - Process validation is the process in which the device design is validated using initial/low volume production processes. The purpose for the process validation is to confirm that the design functions according to design inputs when produced using normal production processes rather than prototype processes. The process validation must be documented in the DHF. *Design validation. Each manufacturer shall establish and maintain procedures for validating the device design. Design validation shall be performed under defined operating conditions on initial production units, lots, or batches, or their equivalents. Design validation shall ensure that devices conform to defined user needs and intended uses and shall include testing of production units under actual or simulated use conditions. Design validation shall include software validation and risk analysis, where appropriate. The results of the design validation, including identification of the design, method(s), the date, and the individual(s) performing the validation, shall be documented in the DHF. *Design transfer - Design transfer is the process in which the device design is translated into production, distribution, and installation specifications. *Design changes - Design changes is the process in which the design changes are identified and documented. Also known as engineering change or enterprise change. *Design history file - The DHF is a formal document that is prepared for each medical device.

He was one of the first generation of writers who established television, taking over from radio, as the most popular medium for comedy. A prolific practitioner, he was a master of the pun and double entendre. During the small screen's Golden Age, he wrote scripts for comedians including Benny Hill, Tony Hancock, Ted Ray, Terry Scott, Spike Milligan, Eric Sykes, Peter Sellers, Charlie Drake, Arthur Askey, Sid James, Leslie Crowther, Roy Hudd, Jimmy Edwards, Tommy Cooper, Harry Worth and Frankie Howerd. Early life Dave Freeman was born in Marylebone, London. He trained as an electrician before joining the Royal Naval Fleet Air Arm at the outbreak of the Second World War. His service with the Pacific fleet took him to Ceylon, India, South Africa, Kenya and finally Australia where he met and married his wife, Alberta. Upon return to England in 1946, he joined the Metropolitan Police as a police constable in Paddington rising to a Special Branch detective at Scotland Yard. After a period back at Special Branch, he became a journalist, then took a job as a security officer for the American Officers' Club in Regent's Park, London. One of his tasks was to book entertainment acts and when he struck up a friendship with Benny Hill, the pair started writing together. Career Benny Hill Freeman co-wrote with Benny Hill from 1955 to 1968 for The Benny Hill Show on BBC. The early series were notable for spoofs of popular television personalities of the time, such as the quiz and talent-show host Hughie Green, the globe-trotting journalist Alan Whicker, and the undersea explorers Hans and Lotte Hass. Freeman was teamed with Hill from the second series, in 1956, and also appeared on screen when the star made one-off shows for ITV (1957–60) under a special contract with Bernard Delfont. He was later responsible for most of the scripts when Hill starred in three series of a BBC sitcom titled simply Benny Hill (1962–63), featuring the comedian in a different role each week in self-contained playlets.  Television, Film and Radio  Alongside his success with Benny Hill, he contributed to sketch-based programmes such as The Ted Ray Show (1955–59), and Great Scott - It's Maynard! (starring the comedy duo Terry Scott and Bill Maynard, 1955–56). In 1955 he joined Associated London Scripts, an agency representing the leading comedy and television writers of the 1950s and 1960s. There he teamed up with John Junkin and Terry Nation to write two series for Elsie and Doris Waters, Gert and Daisy. He then went on to contribute sketches to Spike Milligan's The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d (1956) starring Peter Sellers, the first successful attempt to transform the comedy of The Goon Show from radio to television. Television became Freeman's medium. Moving back and forth between BBC and ITV, Freeman wrote the sitcoms Charlie Drake in . . . (co-scripted with Charlie Drake, who played a different character each week, 1958–59) and both Arthur's Treasured Volumes (1960) and The Arthur Askey Show (1961). He also created and wrote sitcoms for Roy Kinnear and Jimmy Edwards. In A World of His Own (1964–65), Kinnear played the daydreaming Stanley Blake, an outwardly ordinary husband lost in his own fantasies. The Fossett Saga (1969) was a spoof on The Forsyte Saga and starred Edwards as an author of penny-dreadfuls, bon viveur and patron of the arts in Victorian London. Freeman wrote the fantasy serial Knock Three Times (1968), starring Hattie Jacques and based on the children's book by Marion St John Webb. In 1968 he wrote the screenplay to Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon. He also scripted episodes for The Avengers (1968) and It's Tommy Cooper (1970). After contributing to \\"Carry On\\" television specials, Freeman also wrote the feature film Carry On Behind (1975) and Carry On Columbus (1992). Much of his subsequent career was spent contributing episodes to some of television's most popular sitcoms, including Bless This House (1971–76), Robin's Nest (1977–81) and Keep It in the Family, writing nine episodes with his scriptwriter son Greg Freeman, between 1980 and 1983. He wrote, too, for Terry and June (1979–87), which starred Terry Scott and June Whitfield as husband and wife, a pairing that had begun on the sketch show Scott On . . ., for which Freeman wrote the entire third and fourth series in 1970–71.  Theatre  A theatrical collaboration between Benny Hill and Freeman, Fine Fettle opened at the Palace Theatre in 1959. Freeman's stage farce A Bedfull of Foreigners opened at the Victoria Palace in 1973, starring Terry Scott and June Whitfield. In 1974, it transferred to the Duke of York's Theatre starring David Jason. In 1982, Key For Two co-written with John Chapman was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Comedy after opening at the Vaudeville Theatre starring Moira Lister. His third play Kindly Keep It Covered opened in 1987 at the Churchill Theatre starring Terry Scott and Amanda Barrie. All three plays have since been performed all over the world.  Commercials  Freeman wrote over 50 advertisements in a series of television commercials for the soft-drinks company Schweppes starring Benny Hill. The commercials became the first from Britain to win the Grand Prix de la Télévision at the 1961 Cannes International Festival of Publicity Films. Following the success of the Schweppes adverts, Freeman was asked to write a series of television commercials for the Egg Marketing Board starring Tony Hancock and Patricia Hayes.

Van Heerden has also played for the national team, the Springboks. Before his move to the Bulls, he was the captain of the Cats (now known as the Lions). Van Heerden is known for his high work rate, toughness as well as his leadership experience, despite having captained perpetually unsuccessful teams (such as the Cats/Lions during the 2004-6 Super 12/14 seasons in which, only 4 games from 35 were won). He announced his retirement during the 2012 Currie Cup Premier Division season. Career Van Heerden made his debut for the Springboks on 7 June 2003 as flanker against Scotland at Kings Park in Durban. South Africa won the match 29 points to 25. He played at flanker for the second Test against the Scottish a week later at Ellis Park, which South Africa also won, 28 to 19. He was subsequently including in South Africa's 2003 Tri Nations Series squad. He played against the Wallabies at Newlands, which the Springboks won 26 to 22. He also played against the All Blacks at Loftus Versfeld, and was a reserve in another match against Australia at Suncorp Stadium, both of which the Springboks lost. Van Heerden had a good 2007 Super 14 campaign with the Bulls as the team's specialist fetcher. His best game was in the Bulls’ 92–3 win against the Reds at Loftus, scoring two tries in the process. This led to him being selected into the Springboks. In July 2007, Van Heerden played his first Test in four years, against the Wallabies in Sydney. He played very well in this match, being regarded as the best Bok forward, albeit in a second string Springbok XV. He was equally impressive in the match against the All Blacks in Christchurch a week later. These performances lead to his inclusion in the Springbok's victorious 2007 Rugby World Cup squad. On 16 May 2008 it was confirmed that he would join Guinness Premiership side Saracens in November 2008 following his Currie Cup commitments with the Bulls. He scored a try on his debut for Saracens in a 27–14 defeat against London Irish at the Madejski Stadium on 23 November. On 18 March 2010, it was confirmed that Saracens had released him to return to South Africa where he would play for the Lions. This was a surprise, as Saracens had indicated he would see out the season with the club. In his first super rugby season back in South Africa he broke his arm but was back for the first match of the Curriecup. Unfortunately he broke his arm again in exactly the same place in this match, putting him out for several weeks. His father is former Springbok Lock Moaner van Heerden.

History Initially formed by singer/guitarist Simon Williams (aka Crayola), drummer James Higgott (formerly of HOST) and bass player Joe Morris (also of The Reverse), the group played their debut show in central London after having rehearsed only once before going into the studio to record their first record, The Miniest Album. Much was made of the debut record being a 7\\" vinyl single containing 7 songs and so the band decided to release a series of such records. After the second release, The Big Flame (named in honour of their favourite band), James was replaced on drums by Simon Poole, a longtime musical colleague of Crayola. The new line-up recorded two further 7 track 7\\" records, The Feminist Third and The June Bride, before having all four records compiled into a single CD release entitled The Completist's Library by the record label Wrath in the UK and HHBTM in the US. All four records were produced by Anthony Chapman, formerly of Collapsed Lung, who has also produced Bis, Spearmint, Ten Benson, Klaxons, The Keatons and Crazy Gods of Endless Noise. The June Bride takes its name from another of the band's favourite bands and featured guest appearances from Big Flame's Alan Brown and The June Brides' Phil Wilson. The collection has been described as \\"an awful lot of fun\\".Sarandon - The Completist's Library In October 2006 the band were joined by Stephen Gilchrist, replacing Simon Poole on drums - Stephen is best known as Graham Coxon's drummer. He also performs in his own group, Stuffy & the Fuses, as well as working as a drum tutor. In January 2007 Joe decided to take a sabbatical and was replaced by Alan Brown - a founder member of Big Flame and The Great Leap Forward, who has played drums with A Witness and more recently performed as one third of Marshall Smith. Stephen got too busy for his own good and in September 2007 was replaced by Tom Greenhalgh on drums. The new line-up immediately recorded a cover version of an old June Brides song, \\"Every Conversation\\" and a new studio album entitled Kill Twee Pop!, which was released early in 2008 on Slumberland Records. The album was positively received by critics, and has been described as \\"a campaign ad to return to the avant punk rock intonations of the late 70’s and early 80’s.\\",Frances, Susan (2008) \\"Sarandon - Kill Twee Pop\\" (review), absolutepunk.net \\"outlandish, concise and exuberant enough to attract many lovers of rhythmically and lyrically sharp rock\\", and \\"like an XTC album played by bonkers Ritalin unachievers\\",Weingarten, Christopher R. (2008) \\"SARANDON - “Mike's Dollar”\\" (review), paperthinwalls with SoundsXP saying \\"both for restoring the reputation of a certain strand of 80s indiepop and in making refreshingly askew new music with a wicked sense of humour, Sarandon ought to be applauded\\".\\"Sarandon Kill Twee Pop!\\" (review), SoundsXP Sarandon have recorded sessions for BBC Radio 1's One Music show and Marc Riley’s BBC 6 Music show, Rocket Science. In October 2009 John Robb's book Death To Trad Rock was published by Cherry Red Books. It includes a whole chapter devoted to Crayola and Sarandon and their place in the history of the UK independent music scene. As a celebration of the book a 7\\" single was released by Slumberland Records, a split between Sarandon and Robb's former band The Membranes. August 2010 saw the band go into the new studio complex at Bucks University, again with Anthony Chapman producing, to record a new album. Entitled Sarandon's Age Of Reason, the album is something of a concept album with narration provided by The Shend of The Cravats and The Very Things. They were joined on piano by Rhodri Marsden and the album is introduced by Robert Lloyd of The Nightingales.

Criminal justice systems often deal with young offenders differently from adult offenders, but different countries apply the term \\"young offender\\" to different age groups depending on the age of criminal responsibility in that country. United Kingdom The United Kingdom has three separate and distinct criminal justice systems: England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. Young offenders are often dealt with by the Youth Offending Team. There is concern young adult offenders are not getting the support they need to help them avoid reoffending.Offenders aged 18-25 need more attention to deter crime, say MPs BBC In England and Wales the age of criminal responsibility is set at 10. Young offenders aged 10 to 17 (i.e. up to their 18th birthday) are classed as a juvenile offender. Between the ages of 18 and 21 (i.e. up to their 21st birthday) they are classed as young offenders. Offenders aged 21 and over are known as adult offenders. In Scotland the age of criminal responsibility was formerly set at 8, one of the lowest ages of criminal responsibility in Europe. It has since been raised to 12 by the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010, which received Royal Assent on 6 August 2010. In Northern Ireland it is 10. Northern Europe In Sweden, the age of criminal responsibility is set at 15 since 1902.  United States  In the United States, the age of criminal responsibility for federal crimes is set at 11. While this has been set at the federal level, each state is responsible for setting their own age of criminal responsibility. Thirty-three states have no minimum age for criminal responsibility, while the remaining 17 do. North Carolina has the lowest responsibility age of 7 years old and Wisconsin has the highest of 10 years old. There are 1.5 million cases per year in the US that handle status offenses or criminal offenses by young offenders. However, only 52 juveniles were fully sentenced to prison-time between 2010-2015. Recidivism is common among young offenders, with 67% becoming repeat offenders.  Brazil  In Brazil, the age of criminal responsibility is set at the age of 18. Anyone that is found guilty of committing crimes prior to the age of 18 is treated to other options rather than jail. These include, for children under 12, foster care options in order to get them a safer family, and, for young offenders over 12, being sentenced to complying with a range of socioeducative measures that can go from a warning to communitary work and even to internment in specialized facilities, which include basic schooling and profissionalizing courses that aim at preventing the offenders from resorting to crime to support themselves, although conditions in such facilities are often subpar. With a spike in crime rates among young offenders occurring in 2015, along with an almost 40% increase in internments of young offenders, there was a push to lower the age of criminal responsibility to 16, which ultimately failed.

It originally aired in the United Kingdom on BBC Two in March 2007. The series consists of three 60-minute programmes which explore the modern concept and definition of freedom, specifically, \\"how a simplistic model of human beings as self-seeking, almost robotic, creatures led to today's idea of freedom.\\" Production The series was originally to be called Cold Cold Heart and was scheduled for broadcast in 2006. Although it is not known what caused the delay in transmission, nor the change in title, it is known that a DVD release of Curtis's previous series The Power of Nightmares had been delayed due to problems with copyright clearance due to the large quantity of archive material used in Curtis's montage technique. Another documentary series (title unknown) based on very similar lines--\\"examining the world economy during the 1990s\\"--was to have been Curtis's first BBC TV project upon moving to the BBC's Current Affairs unit in 2002, shortly after producing Century of the Self.  Episodes  Part 1. \\"F**k You Buddy\\" In part one, Curtis examines the rise of game theory during the Cold War and the way in which its mathematical models of human behaviour filtered into economic thought. The programme traces the development of game theory, with particular reference to the work of John Nash (the mathematician portrayed in A Beautiful Mind), who believed that all humans are inherently suspicious and selfish creatures that strategize constantly. Building on his theory, Nash constructed logically consistent and mathematically verifiable models, for which he won the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences, commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Economics. He invented system games that reflected his beliefs about human behaviour, including one he called 'Fuck You Buddy' (later published as \\"So Long Sucker\\"), in which the only way to win was to betray your playing partner, and it is from this game that the episode's title is taken. These games were internally coherent and worked correctly as long as the players obeyed the ground rules that they should behave selfishly and try to outwit their opponents, but when RAND's analysts tried the games on their own secretaries, they were surprised to find that instead of betraying each other, the secretaries cooperated every time. This did not, in the eyes of the analysts, discredit the models, but proved that the secretaries were unfit subjects.U.S. Air Force Project RAND Memorandum RM-789-1, \\"Some Experimental Games,\\" Merill M. Flood, 20 June 1952, pp. 15–16: \\"This is in contrast to the proposed theoretical solution in which the two secretaries would have shared the amount g only, with the first secretary receiving m in addition. Upon inquiry, it developed that they had entered into the experiment with the prior agreement to share all proceeds equally!\\" It was not known at the time that Nash was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, and as a result, he was deeply suspicious of everyone around him—including his colleagues—and was convinced that many were involved in conspiracies against him. It was this mistaken belief that led to his view of people as a whole that formed the basis for his theories. Footage of an older and wiser Nash was shown in which he acknowledges that his paranoid views of other people at the time were false. Curtis examines how game theory was used to create the US's nuclear strategy during the Cold War. Because no nuclear war occurred, it was believed that game theory had been correct in dictating the creation and maintenance of a massive American nuclear arsenal--because the Soviet Union had not attacked America with its nuclear weapons, the supposed deterrent must have worked. Game theory during the Cold War is a subject that Curtis examined in more detail in the To the Brink of Eternity part of his first series, Pandora's Box, and he reuses much of the same archive material in doing so. Archive interview with R.D. Laing during episode 1 Another strand in the documentary is the work of R.D. Laing, whose work in psychiatry led him to model familial interactions using game theory. His conclusion was that humans are inherently selfish and shrewd and spontaneously generate stratagems during everyday interactions. Laing's theories became more developed when he concluded that some forms of mental illness were merely artificial labels, used by the state to suppress individual suffering. This belief became a staple tenet of counter-culture in the 1960s. Reference is made to an experiment run by one of Laing's students, David Rosenhan, in which bogus patients, self-presenting at a number of American psychiatric institutions, were falsely diagnosed as having mental disorders, while institutions, informed that they were to receive bogus patients, misidentified genuine patients as imposters. The results of the experiment were a disaster for American psychiatry, because they destroyed the idea that psychiatrists were a privileged elite that was genuinely able to diagnose, and therefore treat, mental illness. Curtis credits the Rosenhan experiment with the inspiration to create a computer model of mental health. Input to the program consisted of answers to a questionnaire. Curtis describes a plan of the psychiatrists to test the computer model by issuing questionnaires to \\"hundreds of thousands\\" of randomly selected Americans. The diagnostic program identified over 50% of the ordinary people tested as suffering from some kind of mental disorder. According to Dr. Jerome Wakefield, who refers to the test as \\"these studies\\", the results it found were viewed as a general conclusion that \\"there is a hidden epidemic.\\" Leaders in the psychiatric field never addressed whether the computer model was being tested or used without having been validated in any way, but rather used the model to justify vastly increasing the portion of the population they were treating. In an interview, the economist James M. Buchanan decries the notion of the \\"public interest\\", asking what it is and suggesting that it consists purely of the self-interest of the governing bureaucrats. Buchanan also proposes that organisations should employ managers who are motivated only by money. He describes those who are motivated by other factors--such as job satisfaction or a sense of public duty--as \\"zealots\\". At the start of the 1970s, the theories of Laing and the models of Nash began to converge, leading to a popular belief that the state (a surrogate family) was purely and simply a mechanism of social control which calculatedly kept power out of the hands of the public. Curtis shows that it was this belief which allowed the theories of Hayek to look credible, and underpinned the free- market beliefs of Margaret Thatcher, who sincerely believed that by dismantling as much of the British state as possible--and placing former nationalised institutions into the hands of public shareholders—a form of social equilibrium could be reached. This was a return to Nash's work, in which he proved mathematically that if everyone pursued their own interests, a stable, yet perpetually dynamic, society would result. The episode ends with the suggestion that this mathematically modelled society is run on data—performance targets, quotas, statistics—and these figures, combined with the exaggerated belief in human selfishness, have created \\"a cage\\" for Western humans. The precise nature of the \\"cage\\" is to be discussed in part two. =Contributors= * John Nash, 1994 winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences * Friedrich von Hayek, Nobel-winning economist and political philosopher * James M.

This was not presented as a conspiracy theory, but as a logical (although unpredicted) outcome of market-driven self-diagnosis by check-list based on symptoms, but not actual causes, discussed in part one. People with standard mood fluctuations diagnosed themselves as abnormal. They then presented themselves at psychiatrist's offices, fulfilled the diagnostic criteria without offering personal histories, and were medicated. The alleged result is that vast numbers of Western people have had their behaviour and mental activity modified by SSRIs without any strict medical necessity. The episode also showed a clip of a fight in a Yanomami village from the film The Ax Fight by Napoleon Chagnon and Tim Asch. According to Chagnon the fight is an example of the impact of kin selection on humans, since the people fighting chose sides on the basis of kinship. Curtis interviews Chagnon and puts to him the assertion of fellow anthropologist Brian Ferguson that much of the Yanamamo violence, particularly its intensity, was very strongly influenced by the presence of Westerners handing out goods which the tribesmen fought over; in this case the goods were highly prized and useful machetes. Chagnon, however, insists that his presence had had no influence whatsoever on the situation, citing the fact that similar fights happened when he wasn't present, which he also documented through informants. Curtis asked, \\"You don't think a film crew in the middle of a fight in a village has an effect?\\" Chagnon replied, \\"No, I don't,\\" and immediately stopped the interview. Footage of Richard Dawkins propounding his gene-centered view of evolution is shown, with archive clips spanning two decades to emphasise how the severely reductionist ideas of programmed behaviour have slowly been absorbed by mainstream culture. (Later, however, the documentary gives evidence that cells are able to selectively replicate parts of DNA dependent on current needs. According to Curtis, such evidence detracts from the simplified economic models of human beings.) This brings Curtis back to the economic models of Hayek and the game theories of the Cold War. Curtis explains how, with the \\"robotic\\" description of mankind apparently validated by geneticists, the game theory systems gained even more currency with society's engineers. The programme describes how the Clinton administration gave in to market theorists in the US and how New Labour in the UK decided to measure everything it could by introducing such arbitrary and unmeasurable targets as: * Reduction of hunger in Sub-Saharan Africa by 48% * Reduction of global conflict by 6% It also introduced a rural community vibrancy index in order to gauge the quality of life in Britain's villages and a birdsong index to measure the apparent decline of wildlife. In industry and public services, this way of thinking led to a plethora of targets, quotas and plans. It was meant to set workers free to achieve these targets in any way they chose. What the government did not realise was that the players, faced with impossible demands, would cheat. Curtis describes how, in order to meet arbitrary targets: * Lothian and Borders Police reclassified dozens of criminal offences as \\"suspicious occurrences\\" in order to keep them out of crime figures; * Some NHS hospital trusts created the unofficial post of \\"The Hello Nurse,\\" whose sole task it was to greet new arrivals in order to claim for statistical purposes that the patient had been \\"seen\\", even though no treatment or examination took place during the encounter; * NHS managers took the wheels off trolleys and reclassified them as beds, while simultaneously reclassifying corridors as wards, in order to falsify Accident & Emergency waiting times statistics. In a section called 'The Death of Social Mobility', Curtis describes how the theory of the free market was applied to education. In the UK, the introduction of school performance league tables was intended to give individual schools more power and autonomy, to enable them to compete for pupils, the theory being that it would motivate the worst-performing schools to improve; it was an attempt to move away from the rigid state control that had offered little choice to parents while failing to improve educational standards, and towards a culture of free choice and incentivisation, without going as far as privatising the schools. Following publication of the school league tables, wealthier parents moved into the catchment areas of the best schools, causing house prices in those areas to rise dramatically--ensuring that poor children were left with the worst-performing schools. This is just one aspect of a more rigidly stratified society which Curtis identifies in the way in which the incomes of working class Americans have actually fallen in real terms since the 1970s, while the incomes of the middle class have increased slightly, and those of the highest one percent of earners (the upper class) have quadrupled. Similarly, babies in the poorest areas in the UK are twice as likely to die in their first year as children from prosperous areas. Curtis ends part two with the observation that game theory and the free market model is now undergoing interrogation by economists who suspect a more irrational model of behaviour is appropriate and useful. In fact, in formal experiments the only people who behaved exactly according to the mathematical models created by game theory are economists themselves, and psychopaths. = Contributors= * James M.

Curtis briefly explains how negative liberty could be defined as freedom from coercion and positive liberty as the opportunity to strive to fulfill one's potential. Tony Blair had read Berlin's essays on the topic and wrote to himletterstoberlin in the late 1990s, arguing that positive and negative liberty could be mutually compatible. As Berlin was on his deathbed at the time, Blair never got a reply. The programme begins with a description of the Two Concepts of Liberty and Berlin's opinion that, since it lacked coercion, negative liberty was the safest of the two concepts. Curtis then explains how many political groups that sought their vision of freedom ended up using violence to achieve it. For example, the French revolutionaries wished to overthrow a monarchical system which they viewed as antithetical to freedom, but in doing so they ended up with the Reign of Terror. Similarly, the Bolshevik revolutionaries in Russia, who sought to overthrow the established order and replace it with a society in which everyone is equal, ended up creating a totalitarian regime which used violence to achieve its objectives. Using violence, not simply as a means to achieve one's goals, but also as an expression of freedom from Western bourgeois norms, was an idea developed by Afro-Caribbean revolutionary Frantz Fanon. He developed it from the existentialist ideology of Jean-Paul Sartre, who argued that terrorism was a \\"terrible weapon, but the oppressed poor have no others.\\"Sartre: The Philosopher of the Twentieth Century, Bernard-Henri Lévy, p. 343 These views were expressed, for example, in the revolutionary film The Battle of Algiers. This part also explores how economic freedom had been introduced in Russia through a series of problematic experiments. A set of policies known as \\"shock therapy\\" (also described in the 2007 book The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein) were brought in mainly by outsiders, with the effect of destroying the social safety net. Sudden removal of subsidies caused hyperinflation, and economic crisis escalated during the 1990s until some people were being paid in goods rather than money. The Russian parliament attempted to revolt, to which then- president Boris Yeltsin responded with military force, subsequently removing parliament's power in favour of autocracy. State-owned industries were sold to private businesses, often at a fraction of their real value. Ordinary people, often in financial difficulties, would sell shares, which to them were worthless, for cash, without appreciating their true value. This culminated with the rise of the \\"Oligarchs\\"--super-rich businessmen who attributed their rise to the sell-offs of the 90s. It resulted in a polarisation of society into the poor and ultra-rich, and increasing autocracy under Vladimir Putin, with promises to provide dignity and basic living requirements. There is a similar review of post-war Iraq, in which an even more extreme \\"shock therapy\\" was employed--the removal from government of all Ba'ath party employees and the introduction of economic models following the simplified economic model of human beings outlined in the first two parts--this resulted in the immediate disintegration of Iraqi society and the rise of two strongly autocratic insurgencies: one based on Sunni-Ba'athist ideals and another based on revolutionary Shi'a philosophies. Curtis also looks at the neoconservative agenda of the 1980s. Like Sartre, they argued that violence is sometimes necessary to achieve their goals, except they wished to spread what they described as democracy. Curtis quotes General Alexander Haig, then-US Secretary of State, as saying that, \\"Some things were worth fighting for.\\" However, Curtis argues, although the version of society espoused by the neoconservatives made some concessions towards freedom, it did not offer true freedom. Although the neoconservatives, for example, forced the Augusto Pinochet regime in Chile and the Ferdinand Marcos regime in the Philippines to hold democratic elections, these transformations to democracy essentially replaced one elite with another, and the gap between those who have power and wealth, and those who have neither, remained; the freedom the change provided was therefore relatively narrow in concept. The neoconservatives wanted to change or overthrow the Sandinistas—a socialist group in Nicaragua—who were seen as tyrannical, destabilising, and a threat to US security; the US therefore supported anti-communist rebels known collectively as the Contras, who, Curtis states, carried out many violations of human rights, including the torture and murder of civilians. US Government financial support to the Contras had been banned by the US Congress, so other means were used to continue financing them, including the CIA allegedly providing aircraft for the rebels to fly cocaine into the United States, as well as the Iran–Contra affair in which the US illegally supplied weapons to the Iranian government, originally in exchange for assistance to gain the release of US prisoners in Lebanon, but also allegedly for cash which was then given to the Contras. Curtis uses this as another example of how the neoconservatives had fallen into the trap that Berlin had predicted: although they wanted to spread negative freedom, because they saw their ideology as an absolute truth they were able to justify using coercion and lies and also to support violence in order to perpetuate it. However such policies did not always result in the achievement of neoconservative aims and occasionally threw up genuine surprises. Curtis examines the Western-backed government of the Shah in Iran, and how the mixing of Sartre's positive libertarian ideals with Shia religious philosophy led to the revolution which overthrew it. Having previously been a meek philosophy of acceptance of the social order, in the minds of revolutionaries such as Ali Shariati and Ayatollah Khomeini, Revolutionary Shia Islam became a meaningful force to overthrow tyranny. The programme examines the government of Tony Blair and its role in achieving its vision of a stable society. In fact, argues Curtis, the Blair government had created the opposite of freedom, in that the type of liberty it had engendered wholly lacked any kind of meaning. Its military intervention in Iraq had provoked terrorist actions in the UK and these terrorist actions were in turn used to justify restrictions on liberty. In essence, the programme suggests that following the path of negative liberty to its logical conclusions, as governments have done in the West for the past 50 years, results in a society without meaning populated only by selfish automatons, and that there was some value in positive liberty in that it allowed people to strive to better themselves. The closing minutes directly state that if Western humans are ever to find their way out of the \\"trap\\" described in the series, they would have to realise that Isaiah Berlin was wrong, and that not all attempts to change the world for the better necessarily lead to tyranny. = Contributors= * Isaiah Berlin, political philosopher * Kenneth Clark, historian, presenter of BBC TV series Civilisation * Malcolm Muggeridge, British journalist * Stuart Hall, cultural historian * Jean-Paul Sartre, existentialist philosopher * Frantz Fanon, psychoanalyst, revolutionary * Jim Howard, field director, OXFAM * Michael Ledeen, advocate of US regime change policy * Alexander Haig, first US Secretary of State under Ronald Reagan * Samuel P.

Since physical boundaries no longer interfere with buy/sell decisions, the world has grown into several industry specific marketspaces which are integration of marketplaces through sophisticated computer and telecommunication technologies. The term marketspace was introduced by Jeffrey Rayport and John Sviokla in 1994 in their article \\"Managing in the Marketspace\\" that appeared in Harvard Business Review. In the article the authors distinguished between electronic and conventional markets. In a marketspace, information and/or physical goods are exchanged, and transactions take place through computers and networks. These networks consist of blogs, forum threads, and micro- blogging services like Twitter; although their article predates Twitter. Businesses and their customers are enabled to create conversations and two-way communications about products and services. These conversations may also happen outside the sphere of control of a given business, when a marketing campaign or customer-service issue captures the attention of web-savvy consumers. Marketspace vs Marketplace A Marketspace is an online space that facilitates bi-directional commerce. Here not only sellers can list their goods, but buyers can list their needs. The role of the Marketspace is to match buyers and sellers whose contexts have sufficient similarity - if the product being offered and being requested has a high degree of match and the buyer and seller can come to agreement on price, location and timing, then a successful match can be made that will culminate in a transaction. Online Marketplaces like Etsy or eBay allow vendors to display and sell products taking advantage of the traffic to the site. The marketplace owner typically takes a commission on the sale. In 1999, the book The Cluetrain Manifesto (The Cluetrain Manifesto) discussed the notions surrounding how the traditional marketplace (or bazaar) was adapting itself to the age of the webwhere \\"markets were conversations\\". By 2010, we see the emergence of numerous online marketplaces: Amazon, eBay, Facebook, and a number of other large online retailersyet these were still largely inventories of supply that consumers would browse and purchase from. However, a new concept of a marketspace is emergenta bi-directional medium which is able to inventory both supply and demand, allow both parties in a transaction to find each other, establish a temporary \\"buyer-seller\\" relationship, and then execute the transaction.  Impact  The marketspace article by Jeffrey Rayport and John Sviokla in Harvard Business Review led to various subsequent Academic investigations in the field of business and marketing. Especially in the field of international business, with its geographic distance sensitivity that the global concept of the marketspace obliterates, the concept of marketspace in the form of the Internet received Academic interest. Jim Hamill, a reader in the marketing department at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland, U.K., at the time, was one of the first to note this link in his 1997 paper. Three years later, a PhD student at the same department investigated the link between marketspace and international business explicitly. However, at present, the term Internet is commonly used to refer to what the term marketspace is referring to.

He won an Oscar in 1972 for Best Original Screenplay, for writing The Candidate. Childhood Jeremy Larner grew up in Indiana in the 1950s, and had some playground rep as a basketball player in Indianapolis, where he encountered Oscar Robertson and other future stars on the playground courts of that city. Education and influences Larner graduated from Brandeis University in 1958 (where he was close to Herbert Marcuse, Irving Howe, Philip Rahv, and a fellow student named Abbie Hoffman, who later, running a small bookstore in Worcester, Massachusetts, became an early champion of Larner's first novel.) Early career In 1959, Larner began a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship at UC Berkeley, but finding himself unsuited for academic life he left graduate school in his first year and came to New York City at 22. He stayed there throughout the 1960s, writing five books in that period. In 1962, Larner was assigned by Dissent magazine to cover the teacher's strike, and spent several months going to elementary school classes in Harlem. His long account of what he discovered was widely anthologized, having come to the attention of Michael Harrington, author of the book, the Other America: Poverty In The United States, which inspired John F. Kennedy & Robert F. Kennedy. Larner's first published piece was a critique of J.D. Salinger, published in Partisan Review in 1961. Also in that year he journeyed south to cover the lunch-counter sit-in strikes organized at black universities, and wrote several pieces for The New Leader and Dissent. In '63, Larner edited a taped collection of interviews with heroin addicts at the Henry Street Settlement in New York. The harrowing stories told in these interviews became the basis of one of the first books from tape: The Addict in the Street, which remained in print for 20 years. Grove Press celebrated its publication in early '65 with a party for Larner and William S. Burroughs, where Norman Mailer challenged Larner to a fight. First novel, Drive, He Said; Writing prizes Larner's first novel, Drive, He Said, won the Delta Prize for first novels in 1964. The prize had gone unclaimed for several years and by then had reached $10,000. The judges were Walter van Tilburg Clark, Mary McCarthy and Leslie Fiedler. For the title of this novel, Larner chose a line from the poem I Know a Man by Robert Creeley.Corman, Cid. \\"On 'I Know a Man.'\\" http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/a_f/creeley/man.htm The heroes of Drive, He Said were a college basketball star who has mixed feelings about his stardom and what is expected of him and his revolutionary roommate, who eventually burns the campus down. The reviewer in Playboy magazine echoed the establishment verdict when he said, \\"Nothing like this could happen in America.\\" In 1964, Larner won the Aga Khan Prize from The Paris Review, for the best short story of the year, \\"O the Wonder!\\" Journalism After 1964, Larner worked as a freelance journalist and published articles, essays and stories in many magazines, including Harpers, The Paris Review, and Life. Larner reported on the trial of Dale Noyd, a decorated fighter pilot who had refused to train other pilots for the war in Vietnam. The account, which ran in Harper's, was selected for an anthology of the best journalism of the year. Academics In 1965, Larner began teaching in the English Department at Stony Brook, State University of New York, although he had no degrees beyond the B.A. He taught classes in poetry and in the modern novel from '65 through '69, taking the year off in 1968, when he won an N.E.A. grant in the first year they were given to individual artists. He would later teach, for one year, at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Eugene McCarthy campaign, 1968 In March 1968, Larner became a principal speechwriter for Eugene McCarthy in his campaign for President, working with him closely from the Wisconsin primary (when LBJ, knowing he was about to lose, announced he would not run for re-election), through the California primary (at the end of which Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated), through the convention in Chicago, where the police were rioting in the streets as Larner wrote and faxed the famous seconding speech which Julian Bond gave for McCarthy, just in time to save Bond (who had never met McCarthy) embarrassment, and help to put him on the map politically. Afterwards Larner wrote a book, Nobody Knows, about his travels with the McCarthy Campaign, and most of it was serialized in Harpers Magazine in April & May 1969. This book got good reviews and was widely read by many who participated in the campaign and wondered what happened to McCarthy after the assassination of Robert Kennedy. Drive, He Said: The movie In 1971, Drive, He Said, was made into a movie directed by Jack Nicholson, who collaborated with Larner on the screenplay. This film constituted Nicholson's directorial debut,Canby, Vincent. \\"Drive He Said\\" [Review] New York Times (June 14, 1971) and is available as part of the Criterion edition \\"America Lost and Found: The BBS Story.\\" http://www.criterion.com/films/27530-drive-he-said Vietnam Peace Movement Larner continued his work with the peace movement in 1969. During the Moratorium which mobilized hundreds of thousands of people around the country, he wrote speeches for Sam Brown, the chief organizer and spokesperson of the Moratorium, and also for Paul Newman, who gave a statement on behalf of several actors who were advocating that war protesters miss a day of work. During this time and afterwards, Larner spoke at many college campuses, first in behalf of the anti-Vietnam-war movement, later on movies and politics. He has spoken at one hundred universities around the country. The Candidate In April 1971, Larner wrote a documentary-style script for a feature film directed by Michael Ritchie and starring Robert Redford about a campaign for Senator of California. The Candidate was released during the election of 1972, and was critically acclaimed; the film holds a score of 95% on Rotten Tomatoes based on eighteen critical reviews. Academy Award In 1973, Larner got an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for his script of The Candidate. Political implications Some politicians, like Dan Quayle, did not seem to realize the movie was ironic. Quayle spoke frequently about how the movie had inspired him, causing Larner, during the 1988 elections, to write an op-ed for The New York Times, saying, \\"Mr. Quayle, this was not a how-to movie, it was a watch-out movie. And you are what we should be watching out for!\\" Larner, Jeremy. \\"Politics Catches up to 'The Candidate.'\\" New York Times (October 23, 1988): p. E23. During this time, Larner occasionally wrote speeches for politicians, like Bill Bradley, when he gave his basic position on Israel, or stars like Robert Redford, when he spoke in behalf of environmentalism. Later work In 1987 Larner began to write poetry, and in 1989 began to have public readings. In 1992, he wrote a long story, titled \\"Rack's Rules\\", the only piece of fiction in an anthology titled Sex, Death & God in Los Angeles. After losing his home in the 1991 Oakland Hills fire, he contributed an article to Fire in the Hills, a compilation of responses to the fire, and became a regular contributor to New Choices magazine. Sleep Apnea Larner moved back to New York City in the 90's, where he reached a point of severe disorientation before being diagnosed with sleep apnea, and wrote an article about the condition (not diagnosed or treatable until the 1980s) and his experience of it, that caused many people to recognize and recover completely from a state that otherwise can lead to sudden death. Chicken on Church It was in New York that Larner was inspired to write Chicken on Church, both a mock-epic and a love poem to the city, particularly to the neighborhood on the end of Manhattan Island, Whitmanesque but full of specific detail and classical allusions. He first wrote the poem in 1992, and has revised it frequently since then. \\"Chicken on Church\\" and selected other poems have recently been published by Big Rooster Press. Present activities Jeremy Larner now lives outside of San Francisco, continuing to write poetry, finishing a Hollywood novel based on \\"Rack's Rules\\", and making notes for his memoirs.

Woodland This is ancient woodland and has a canopy comprising mainly ash (including coppiced stools), pedunculate oak and field maple, and some crab apple and holly. There has been some interplanting with beech, Scots pine, spruce and larch. The understorey is dominated by hazel. This also contains goat willow and dogwood. Plants The ground layer includes herb paris, green hellebore and lily- of-the-valley which grow amongst bluebell, yellow archangel, wood anemone, ramsons (wood garlic), wood-sorrel and many ferns. The stream (Kilcott Brook). which is one of the features of the reserve, is edged by opposite-leaved golden-saxifrage and pendulous sedge. It has small waterfalls. Some of them are petrified with calcaerous tufa deposits. The damp valley bottom below Saddlewood Roughs supports butterbur in the spring and meadow saffron in the autumn. There are small glades in the hawthorn and blackthorn thickets in Back Common which indicates this area's past use as common grazing land. The rough banks in the north of the reserve have a typical limestone grassland flora including wild thyme, common rock-rose and early-purple orchid. Other species There are good populations of butterflies including chalkhill blue, marbled white, green hairstreak and the Duke of Burgundy fritillary. The bird life is supported by the diverse habitat. In the woods treecreeper, little owl, lesser spotted woodpecker, nuthatch, marsh tit, wood warbler and goldcrest have been recorded. In the stream area dipper and grey wagtail have been recorded. In the rough grassland areas meadow pipit and yellowhammer have been recorded. Other notable species are yellow-necked field mouse, common dormouse and fallow deer. Nest boxes support the dormouse population. Conservation Conservation work in the reserve includes coppicing of hazel, thinning of young ash, and clearing of invasive scrub such as hawthorn, blackthorn and oak in areas designated as open grassland.

The preservation service enables verifiability of claims supported by the cited sources even when the original web pages are being revised, removed, or disappear for other reasons, an effect known as link rot. As of July 2019, WebCite no longer accepts new archiving requests but continues to serve existing archives.  Service features  All types of web content, including HTML web pages, PDF files, style sheets, JavaScript and digital images can be preserved. It also archives metadata about the collected resources such as access time, MIME type, and content length. WebCite is a non-profit consortium supported by publishers and editors, and it can be used by individuals without charge. It was one of the first services to offer on- demand archiving of pages, a feature later adopted by many other archiving services. It does not do web page crawling.  History  Conceived in 1997 by Gunther Eysenbach, WebCite was publicly described the following year when an article on Internet quality control declared that such a service could also measure the citation impact of web pages. In the next year, a pilot service was set up at the address webcite.net. Although it seemed that the need for WebCite decreased when Google's short term copies of web pages began to be offered by Google Cache and the Internet Archive expanded their crawling (which started in 1996),Fixing Broken Links on the Internet, Internet Archive blog, October 25, 2013. WebCite was the only one allowing \\"on-demand\\" archiving by users. WebCite also offered interfaces to scholarly journals and publishers to automate the archiving of cited links. By 2008, over 200 journals had begun routinely using WebCite.  Profile at Resarchgate WebCite used to be, but is no longer, a member of the International Internet Preservation Consortium. In a 2012 message on Twitter, Eysenbach commented that \\"WebCite has no funding, and IIPC charges €4000 per year in annual membership fees.\\" WebCite \\"feeds its content\\" to other digital preservation projects, including the Internet Archive. Lawrence Lessig, an American academic who writes extensively on copyright and technology, used WebCite in his amicus brief in the Supreme Court of the United States case of MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.  Fundraising  WebCite ran a fund-raising campaign using FundRazr from January 2013 with a target of $22,500, a sum which its operators stated was needed to maintain and modernize the service beyond the end of 2013. This includes relocating the service to Amazon EC2 cloud hosting and legal support. it remained undecided whether WebCite would continue as a non-profit or as a for-profit entity. Compare:  Usage  WebCite allows on-demand prospective archiving. It is not crawler-based; pages are only archived if the citing author or publisher requests it. No cached copy will appear in a WebCite search unless the author or another person has specifically cached it beforehand. To initiate the caching and archiving of a page, an author may use WebCite's \\"archive\\" menu option or use a WebCite bookmarklet that will allow web surfers to cache pages just by clicking a button in their bookmarks folder.WebCite Best Practices Guide .pdf One can retrieve or cite archived pages through a transparent format such as : \`http://webcitation.org/query?url=URL&date;=DATE\` where \`URL\` is the URL that was archived, and \`DATE\` indicates the caching date. For example, : \`http://webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMain_Page&date;=2008-03-04\` or the alternate short form \`http://webcitation.org/5W56XTY5h\` retrieves an archived copy of the URL \`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\` that is closest to the date of March 4, 2008. The ID (5W56XTY5h) is the UNIX time in base 62. WebCite does not work for pages which contain a no-cache tag. WebCite respects the author's request to not have their web page cached. One can archive a page by simply navigating in their browser to a link formatted like this: : \`http://webcitation.org/archive?url=urltoarchive&email;=youremail\` Compared to Wayback Machine : \`https://web.archive.org/urltoarchive\` replacing \`urltoarchive\` with the full URL of the page to be archived, and \`youremail\` with their e-mail address. This is how the WebCite bookmarklet works. Once archived on WebCite, users can try to create an independent second-level backup copy of the starting URL, saving a second time the new WebCite's domain URL on web.archive.org, and on archive.is. Users can more conveniently do this using a browser add-on for archiving.  Business model  The term \\"WebCite\\" is a registered trademark. WebCite does not charge individual users, journal editors and publishers any fee to use their service. WebCite earns revenue from publishers who want to \\"have their publications analyzed and cited webreferences archived\\", and accepts donations. Early support was from the University of Toronto.  Copyright issues  WebCite maintains the legal position that its archiving activities are allowed by the copyright doctrines of fair use and implied license. To support the fair use argument, WebCite notes that its archived copies are transformative, socially valuable for academic research, and not harmful to the market value of any copyrighted work. WebCite argues that caching and archiving web pages is not considered a copyright infringement when the archiver offers the copyright owner an opportunity to \\"opt-out\\" of the archive system, thus creating an implied license. To that end, WebCite will not archive in violation of Web site \\"do- not-cache\\" and \\"no-archive\\" metadata, as well as robot exclusion standards, the absence of which creates an \\"implied license\\" for web archive services to preserve the content. In a similar case involving Google's web caching activities, on January 19, 2006, the United States District Court for the District of Nevada agreed with that argument in the case of Field v. Google (CV-S-04-0413-RCJ-LRL), holding that fair use and an \\"implied license\\" meant that Google's caching of Web pages did not constitute copyright violation. The \\"implied license\\" referred to general Internet standards. DMCA requests According to their policy, after receiving legitimate DMCA requests from the copyright holders, WebCite removes saved pages from public access, as the archived pages are still under the safe harbor of being citations. The pages are removed to a \\"dark archive\\" and in cases of legal controversies or evidence requests there is pay-per-view access of \\"$200 (up to 5 snapshots) plus $100 for each further 10 snapshots\\" to the copyrighted content.

The premier library in the United States Department of Defense, the AU Library holds especially strong collections in the fields of warfare, aeronautics, United States Air Force and DOD operations, military sciences, international relations, military education, leadership and management. Named for General Muir S. Fairchild, the founder and first commander of Air University, the library serves as the focal point of faculty and student research, holding more than 2.9 million items. History In April 1946 the newly formed Air University Library (AUL) was located at building 37, preparing for the AU's opening in September, as part of what was expected to be “the most progressive and forward looking system of military education in the entire world.” The AUL was organizationally structured as its predecessor, the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics Library, at Orlando, Florida. The organizational structure consisted of five divisions and six branches located at Maxwell and the now-defunct Craig Air Force Base, in Alabama, and at the School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Field in Texas. By 1951 the AUL had expanded to six divisions in order to accommodate and service its branches. In August 1949, Headquarters United States Air Force changed the designation of the AUL to the “Department of the Air Force Library.” The following month, the Air Historical Group (later to become the Air Force Historical Research Agency moved from Washington, D.C. to Maxwell Air Force Base. After several administrative changes had occurred due to the merger the Library once again became the “Air University Library” in March 1950. On January 17, 1951, Building 37 was designated “Fairchild Memorial Hall” and a commemorative plaque was installed to honor Fairchild, Air University’s first commander, who had since been promoted to the rank of General and was at the time of his death (March 17, 1950) the vice-Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force. By the end of the 1940s the problems of scattered and decentralized collections were becoming apparent. A request for a newer building was submitted in 1950 and summarily disapproved. Later the Air University Board of Visitors championed the cause of a newer and centralized facility, and on April 28, 1955 a formal groundbreaking ceremony was held in what was to become the center of the Air University Academic Circle (Chennault Circle) . The new Fairchild Memorial Hall (Building 1405) was formally dedicated on October 18, 1956.

Area code 270 serves the Commonwealth of Kentucky's western and south central counties. Area code 270 was split from area code 502 on April 19, 1999. Planning for the introduction of a second area code for the region, area code 364, began in 2007. After several years of delay, it was announced in December 2012 that the second code would be introduced as an overlay in August 2013, with mandatory 10-digit dialing within the geographic region beginning on February 1, 2014. Numbers in area code 364 were made available for assignment on March 3, 2014. Major cities in the region include Hopkinsville, Paducah, Henderson, Murray, Bowling Green, Owensboro, Elizabethtown, and Madisonville. It also includes Kentucky's share of Fort Campbell. History Area code 270 split off from area code 502 in 1999. The split generally followed the boundary between the Eastern and Central time zones; generally, Kentucky's share of the Central Time Zone became 270. The creation of 270 was intended as a long-term solution. However, within only six years, 270 was already close to exhaustion due to the proliferation of cell phones and pagers. In 2006, Kentucky officials announced that 270 would run out of numbers in late 2007. On May 31, 2007, the Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) announced that 270 would be split along the Pennyrile Parkway, with a newly created area code serving western Kentucky (Paducah, Hopkinsville, Henderson, Madisonville, Murray, and the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell), with west-central Kentucky (Bowling Green, Owensboro and Elizabethtown) retaining 270. The PSC did note that mandatory number pooling, recently imposed on the region, may delay the implementation of the new code-- and thus spare customers in the territory slated to move to 364 the expense and burden of having to change their numbers for the second time in a decade. Surprisingly, Kentucky's two most urbanized area codes, 502 (Louisville) and 859 (serving Lexington and Northern Kentucky), were not expected to exhaust until 2017 at the earliest, even though they have fewer numbers than 270. On June 13, 2007, the PSC announced that the new area code will be 364, but also announced that the previously announced implementation would be delayed in favor of number conservation measures including expanded number pooling. On June 15, 2007, the PSC postponed the permissive dialing of the new 364 area code to October 1, 2008. Mandatory dialing to the new area code was changed as well, but the actual date was to be determined later by the PSC. On November 1, 2007, the PSC again postponed permissive dialing of the new 364 area code, this time to January 1, 2009. On March 31, 2008, the PSC again postponed permissive dialing of the new 364 area code, to April 1, 2010. A date for mandatory dialing to 364 was left undetermined. On June 2, 2009, the PSC again postponed permissive dialing of the new 364 area code, to January 1, 2012. Mandatory dialing to 364 was still left undetermined. The split was suspended indefinitely on August 13, 2010 with no permissive dialing date. In December 2010, relief was suspended completely and was believed to be dead. These subsequent delays of the implementation of the 270 / 364 area code split were due to further use of number conservation measures, including mandatory and expanded number pooling, as well as a weakened economy and a reduced usage of telephone numbers dedicated for use by computer and fax modems. On September 27, 2012, the PSC announced that all number conservation options had been exhausted, and the implementation of 364 could no longer be delayed. According to the PSC, NANPA projected the 270 region would exhaust by the first quarter of 2014. NANPA recommended that instead of the original proposal for a split, 364 should be implemented as an overlay for the 270 region. Under the NANPA proposal, existing 270 numbers would be retained by customers, but 10-digit dialing for local calls would be required across western Kentucky. The PSC would also consider an alternate proposal to split the 270 area code region. \\"Splitting the area code in two avoids ten digit dialing but requires changing all current area code 270 numbers within the new area code to 364. That includes numbers assigned to wireless devices,\\" said Andrew Melnykovych, Director of Communications for the PSC. The commission announced plans to hold public meetings throughout the 270 region the next month to explain the options and receive public comment. The commission also said that it will accept comments on the industry's overlay proposal for the 270 region up through November 16.

The numbers 859 spell out \\"UKY\\" on a standard keypad—a nod to Lexington being home of the University of Kentucky. When an area code is split, normal practice calls for the largest city to retain the old area code in order to minimize disruption. Thus, conventional wisdom would have suggested that Lexington and Northern Kentucky would have retained 606 in the 1999 split. Lexington was by far the largest city in the old 606 territory. Combined, Lexington and Northern Kentucky accounted for two-thirds of the old 606's population, along with the great majority of its landlines and cell phones. However, several counties in eastern Kentucky are among the poorest in the nation. The Kentucky Public Service Commission and BellSouth (now part of AT&T;), then the region's main telephone carrier, decided to let the rural portion retain 606 in order to spare this notoriously impoverished area the added expense and burden of switching to a new area code.

Ribeira Palace (; ) was the main residence of the Kings of Portugal, in Lisbon, for around 250 years. Its construction was ordered by King Manuel I of Portugal when he found the Royal Alcáçova of São Jorge unsuitable. The palace complex underwent numerous reconstructions and reconfigurations from the original Manueline design, ending with its final Mannerist and Baroque form. The Ribeira Palace, as well as most of the city of Lisbon, was destroyed in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. After the earthquake, the reigning monarch, King José I, suffered from claustrophobia and chose to live the rest of his life in a group of pavilions in the hills of Ajuda, and thus the palace was never rebuilt. Today, Lisbon's primary square, the Praça do Comércio, is situated on the site of the former palace. The square is still popularly referred to as the Terreiro do Paço (\\"Palace Yard/Square\\"), reminiscent of the now destroyed royal residence.  History   Manueline era  A 16th-century painting of the Holy Martyrs of Lisbon uses Ribeira Palace in the background as a metonym for the city: King Manuel I's original palace, done in the Manueline style, was the head of his royal and imperial administration. After the Siege of Lisbon, in 1147, the monarchs of Portugal had used the Palace of Alcáçova, in the São Jorge Castle, as their residence while in Lisbon, which did not become Portugal's definite capital until 1225. Over the years, various Portuguese monarchs added to the Palace of Alcáçova, and by the time King Manuel I of Portugal succeeded the throne, the Palace of Alcáçova was a large, but cramped, complex, not fitting with the tastes of King Manuel I. With his lucrative profits from Portugal's monopoly on the spice trade, King Manuel I set off on a building spree, renovating the Lisbon landscape, and starting with the construction of a new royal palace. The groundbreaking of the palace was in 1498. The new palace was not to be located on a high and easily protected fortress hill, like the Palace of Alcáçova was, but instead was built on the river shore of the Tagus river, giving it the name of Ribeira Palace, or Palace of the Riverside. The new royal palace was located in the heart of renaissance Lisbon, which had become one of the most important cities and ports in all Europe, on account of its importance in the spice trade and Age of Discoveries. Ribeira palace was situated next to the Ribeira das Naus shipyard and near all the major Lisbon trading houses. In 1502, the palace had been built large enough so that the Portuguese Royal Court could begin moving into the palace. In 1508, King Manuel I started expansion works on the palace, which ended in 1510, and appointed Diogo de Arruda as head architect of the project. The King was an absolutist in all manners, and sought to concentrate all his powers in Ribeira Palace, by holding the Portuguese Cortes and installing the Casa da Índia, the imperial administration, in the palace's walls. John III's renovations. Alterations can be seen in the King's Tower. The palace of King Manuel I, and his successors until King Henry I of Portugal, was a true palace of the Portuguese Renaissance. Done in the Manueline style, among others, the palace included various wings, loggia, balconies, gardens, and courtyards. The main loggia of the palace, facing the Terreiro do Paço, followed the style employed by King Manuel I at many of his palaces, most notably at the Royal Palace of Évora. The hallmark of the palace, not just in the Manueline era but in all its history, was its Tower of the King, in the southern wing. During the Manueline era, the Casa da Índia was installed in the tower, which hoisted a large sculpture of the Royal Coat of Arms of Portugal on the exterior of the tower, facing the river. Starting in 1525, King John III sponsored a set of enlargements and renovations to the palace, which, most notably, altered the Tower of the King, expanding it and opening a large balcony, faced towards the Tagus. It was during the Manueline era, when the House of Aviz ruled Portugal, that the Portuguese Renaissance truly flourished, and Ribeira Palace was one of its centers. It was a beacon for artists, scientists, navigators, and noblemen from all over Portugal and Europe alike. It was at Ribeira Palace, in 1515, that Gil Vicente, the father of Portuguese and Spanish theatre, first performed his play Quem Tem Farelos? for King Manuel I. The palace was also where other great Portuguese and European artists and scholars presented themselves, including Luís de Camões, Portuguese playwright, Cristóvão de Morais, Portuguese painter, and Pedro Nunes, Portuguese mathematician and royal tutor.  Philipine era  Philippine era, the palace changed hugely, scrapping the original Manueline for a Mannerist style. Catherine of Braganza departs from the Palace Square, en route to England, 23 April 1662 When the House of Habsburg seized the throne, in 1580, the newly acclaimed King Philip I of Portugal started a large series of constructions and renovations throughout Portugal, seeking to rehabilitate the kingdom after the War of the Portuguese Succession. During his three-year stay in Lisbon, from 1580 to 1583, King Philip I, who also ruled as King of Castile, Aragon, and Naples, considered turning Lisbon into the imperial capital of his trans- European monarchy and empire. To better suit Lisbon for King Philip I's extravagant court, the King ordered the remodeling and expansion of Ribeira Palace, under the authority of Filipe Terço, the Master of the Royal Works. King Philip I decided to modernize the palace, stripping it of its early renaissance, Manueline style and planning and converting Ribeira Palace into a monumental, organized Mannerist complex. The highlight of the Philippine renovations was the reconstruction and enlargement of the Tower of the King, which transformed a three-story Manueline tower, which housed the Casa da Índia, into a five-story Mannerist tower, complete with an observatory and one of the largest royal libraries in all of Europe.To beautify the palace the monarch commissioned several artists, such as Correggio, Rubens and, most famously, Titian, who made a massive painting on the ceiling of the Royal Library portraying Philip II holding a globe and being crowned. When King Philip I left Lisbon, in 1583, Ribeira Palace became the official seat of the Council of Portugal and the residence of the Viceroys of Portugal. King Philip I's successors, King Philip II, and King Philip III, did not continue his legacy of stressing the importance of Lisbon, and instead visited their Portuguese capital only on rare ceremonial occasions. However, each time King Philip II and King Philip III visited Ribeira Palace, they ordered the construction of a ceremonial arch for the palace's Terreiro do Paço, culminating in a large series or triumphal and ceremonial arches by the end of the Philippine era.  Brigantine era  Brigantine era was a vast and modern palatial complex, including an opera and cathedral. Another King to improve the Palace was John V, who invested great sums – derived from the gold mines in colonial Brazil – to enlarge and embellish the Ribeira Palace. The original manueline chapel was turned into a magnificent baroque church, and the Palace gained another wing for the Queen, parallel to the previous one, commissioned to the Italian Antonio Cannevari. Later in the century, King Joseph I built a Royal Opera House by the Palace, designed by the Italian Giuseppe Bibiena. Washing of the Feet by John V of Portugal\\", one of the few representations of the interior of the Ribeira Palace (1748). The Ópera do Tejo, inaugurated in 1755, lasted only a few months. On 1 November 1755, a huge earthquake, and resulting tsunami and fire destroyed the palace and most of Lisbon. The 70,000-volume royal library housed within the palace, as well as hundreds of works of art, were lost. The royal archives disappeared together with detailed historical records of explorations by Vasco da Gama and other early navigators. King Joseph I was not at the palace and survived. His Prime Minister, the 1st Marquis of Pombal, coordinated a massive reconstruction effort that would give rise to the Pombaline Downtown of Lisbon. The royal family abandoned the Ribeira area and moved to palaces in the areas of Ajuda and Belém. The old Palace Square (Terreiro do Paço) gave rise to a new square, the Pombaline Commerce Square (Praça do Comércio). The two towers at the corners of the square are still reminiscent of the old tower of the Ribeira Palace. 1755 earthquake, enough of Ribeira Palace's frame stood to reconstruct, but it was demolished.

After the earthquake, the square was completely remodeled as part of the rebuilding of the Pombaline Downtown, ordered by Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal, who was the Minister of the Kingdom of Portugal from 1750 to 1777, during the reign of Dom José I, King of Portugal.

Terreiro do Paço in 1575 Terreiro do Paço in 1662, by Dirk Stoop Urban development of the banks of the Tagus river (the Ribeira) was given a definitive impulse in the early 16th century, when King Manuel I built a new royal residence – the Ribeira Palace – by the river, outside the city walls. The area was further developed with the building of a port, shipbuilding facilities (the Ribeira das Naus), the Casa da Índia and other administrative buildings that regulated the commerce between Portugal and other parts of Europe and its colonies in Africa, Asia and the Americas. On 1 November 1755, during the reign of King Dom José I, a great earthquake followed by a tsunami and fire destroyed most of Lisbon, including the Ribeira Palace and other buildings by the river. José I's Prime Minister, the Marquis of Pombal, coordinated a massive rebuilding effort led by Portuguese architect Eugénio dos Santos. He designed a large, rectangular square in the shape of a \\"U\\", open towards the Tagus. The buildings have galleries on their ground floors, and the arms of the \\"U\\" end in two large towers, reminiscent of the monumental tower of the destroyed Ribeira Palace, still vivid in the architectural memory of the city. His plan was realised almost completely, although decorative details were changed and the east tower of the square and the Augusta Street Arch were only finished in the 19th century. This triumphal arch was designed by the Portuguese architect Santos de Carvalho and was completed in 1873. The top section includes statues representing important Portuguese figures such as Vasco da Gama and the Marquis of Pombal.https://www.lisbon.net/commerce- square, Commerce Square The square was named Praça do Comércio, the Square of Commerce, to indicate its new function in the economy of Lisbon. The symmetrical buildings of the square were filled with government bureaux regulating customs and port activities. The centrepiece of the ensemble was the equestrian statue of King José I, inaugurated in 1775 in the centre of the square. This bronze statue, the first monumental statue dedicated to a king in Lisbon, was designed by Joaquim Machado de Castro, Portugal's foremost sculptor of the time.

This arch, usually called the Arco da Rua Augusta, was designed by Veríssimo da Costa. It has a clock and statues of Glory, Ingenuity and Valor (by the French sculptor Calmels) and those of Viriatus, Nuno Álvares Pereira, Vasco da Gama and, of course, the Marquis of Pombal. On 1 February 1908, the square was the scene of the assassination of Carlos I, the penultimate King of Portugal. On their way back from the palace of Vila Viçosa to the royal palace in Lisbon, the carriage containing Carlos I and his family passed through the Terreiro do Paço. While crossing the square, shots were fired from the crowd by at least two men: Alfredo Luís da Costa and Manuel Buiça. The king died immediately, his heir Luís Filipe was mortally wounded, and Prince Manuel was hit in the arm. The assassins were shot on the spot by police and later recognized as members of the Republican Party – which two years later overthrew the Portuguese monarchy. The wealth of Portugal was channeled through this plaza and port. It serves as not only a transportation hub but also as a hub for commercial businesses, having two main directions of travel, west and south. The northern side tram leads to the district of Belem and the southern port is a ferry that goes across the River Tagus. The destruction of the palace led to the loss of the greatest archive of Portuguese literature. The library housed over 200,000 thousand books.

The area incorporates most of the region defined as the Knoxville-Sevierville-La Follette Combined Statistical Area. Cities in the 865 area include Knoxville, Alcoa, Bean Station, Clinton, Gatlinburg, Harriman, Jefferson City, Kingston, Lenoir City, Maryville, Maynardville, Norris, Oak Ridge, Pigeon Forge, Plainview, Rockwood, Rutledge, Sevierville and Townsend. History When planning of the area code system concluded in 1947, area code 901 was assigned as the sole area code for Tennessee. In 1954, the numbering plan area was restricted to West Tennessee, while everything east of the Tennessee River received the new area code 615. This division remained in place for 41 years, until area code 423 was created as the area code for most of East Tennessee, with 615 restricted to Middle Tennessee. The state's three area codes were now roughly coextensive with the Grand Divisions of Tennessee. This was intended as a long-term solution. However, within only three years, 423 was already on the brink of exhaustion due to the proliferation of cell phones and pagers. With the prospect of 423 being exhausted by 1999, it soon became apparent that East Tennessee needed another area code, even though this would have forced some residents to change their numbers for the second time in a decade. The Tennessee Regulatory Authority requested that the code 865 be assigned to Knoxville when the area was split from 423. This was because on a standard telephone keypad, the numbers 865 correspond to the letters VOL, the commonly used short version of Volunteers, which is the formal nickname of the sports teams at the University of Tennessee.http://www.greenevillesun.com/news/article_ec25a9f2-a55b-5f03-9f2a-49a096d34751.html Normally, when an area code is split, the largest city in an existing numbering plan area keeps the original code—in this case, Knoxville. When plans were drawn up for the split, it was decided that the Tri-Cities were not large enough for their own area code, but were too large to follow Knoxville into 865. This left the Tennessee Regulatory Authority with two options–turn 865 into an overlay for all of East Tennessee, or make two non-contiguous sections of 423. Overlays were a new concept at the time, and met with some resistance due to the need for ten-digit dialing. The Regulatory Authority chose the second option. 865 began its split on October 1, 1999; permissive dialing of 423 continued throughout East Tennessee until February 1, 2000.See Brewer, Bill. \\"423 Area Code To Become VOL In 9 ET Counties.\\" Knoxville News- Sentinel.

The area covers approximately , mostly occupied by housing, and includes Branksome Chine which leads to the award-winning blue-flagged beaches of Poole. Description Branksome Park is one of Poole's most affluent areas alongside Sandbanks, Canford Cliffs, Evening Hill, Lilliput, and Salterns Marina. It is on the border of Poole, with Bournemouth being on the other side of The Avenue. It is less than two miles (3 km) from the shopping areas of Westbourne and The Square in the centre of Bournemouth. House prices vary widely in the area; there are small 1960s flats costing just under £200,000 and mansions costing well over £3 million. A new mansion called Sleon House, with of living accommodation, was recently built with a price tag of £5,250,000. The area is a contrast to neighbouring Sandbanks, whilst although being affluent, the community is not focused towards development based around the beach; there are very few properties directly on the waterfront. Instead most of the residential zone of Branksome Park is inland. Demographically a large percentage of the elderly people live in the area (Poole Town and Parkstone also have a high percentage). The population of elderly people (mainly over 85) in the area is expected to rise even more by 2025. Although Branksome Park is geographically part of Poole, its origin, like those of Canford Cliffs, Sandbanks, and Lilliput, is a direct result of overspill of the rapidly expanding town of Bournemouth at the turn of the 20th century. Wealthy landowners had settled originally on the East Cliff, then on the West Cliff, and later in Talbot Woods. A lack of remaining land suitable for opulent dwellings, combined with the popularity of Bournemouth as the leading seaside resort during the late Victorian and Edwardian eras, meant that the privileged classes would need to build on the heathland that extended to the Bournemouth boundary. As late as the 1970s, it was common for residents of Branksome Park and Canford Cliffs Village, to refer to themselves as living in Bournemouth. Such residents included Tolkien, Mantovani, and Max Bygraves. This dramatically fast expansion to the Town of Bournemouth, facilitated by the need for a main railway line from London to Bournemouth, gave rise to hundreds of working- class labourers and their families seeking work in the area, serving the wealthy landowners, working at the resort's newly built hotels, and on the railway. Housing was also required for these working-class families, and so Branksome, and Upper Parkstone quickly developed in the areas least likely to be seen by the wealthy. Until the late 1970s, the railway tracks beyond Bournemouth were not electrified. Local facilities include a sports area with tennis courts and a bowling green. Branksome Park also has a small public library and is home to the All Saints Church constructed in 1877, and a school for disabled children which is located on the outskirts of the area. Branksome Chine There are many beautiful walks along many of the paths to the sea; called \\"Chines\\". Some of these have now been built on such as Monkey Chine, but many are still used by walkers and cars such as Branksome and Alum Chine. The appellation \\"Chine\\" is peculiar to the Hampshire and Dorset coast, from Walkford to the Purbecks, and also to the Isle of Wight, and describes a deep wooded ravine, with, or without a stream or brook, leading to the sea. Recent development Branksome Park has seen much residential development in recent years. However, the styles of new buildings remain much less controversial than other places such as Sandbanks. However, the architect Eddie Mitchell (owner of Seven Developments), received planning permission and has recently finished construction of a controversial building development known as the 'Thunderbird' which is a residential development. The building has also received many awards, making it one of the best-known residential buildings of Dorset. Because the style and architecture of existing housing stock is much older, new plans for developments must fit in with existing properties and styles. According to the rules on development in Branksome Park, one can only build more than one property on a plot that is 3/4 of an acre or larger. In 2006, two large Victorian houses were demolished to make way for a controversial new housing development with 20 three storey homes. Famous residents A noted resident of Branksome Park was Wilfred Rhodes, who died there. a house in Branksome Park called Cerne Abbas (named after the historic village in Dorset), which was later turned into a retirement home for war veterans. This building has now been demolished. Other people who have resided in Branksome Park include Bob Monkhouse, Max Bygraves, J. R. R. Tolkien, Mantovani, Tony Blackburn, Gerry Marsden, Ed Stewart, Archibald Matthias Dunn and Tom Jones.

The Ababil comes in two main lines, the Ababil-2 and the Ababil-3, of which the former has a number of variants. It is considered a long-range, low-technology drone. The Ababil program was begun during the Iran–Iraq War. The Ababil-2, developed in the 1990s, has rudimentary surveillance capabilities and can be used as a loitering munition, but is mainly used as a target drone. The larger and more capable Ababil-3, introduced in the 2000s, was designed for Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance use and has improved surveillance capabilities. Overall, the Ababil is \\"a pretty rough-and-ready system\\": cheap, simple, and easy to use. The Ababil-2 and Ababil-3 have been widely exported to governments and non- state actors in the Middle East and elsewhere. The Ababil has been used in the 2006 Lebanon War, the Iraq War, and the Sudanese, Syrian, Iraqi, and Yemeni civil wars.  Development  The early history of the Ababil is unclear. Jane's reports that the Ababil program was begun at Qods Aviation Industries in 1986 and the first delivery was in 1993. Iranian military expert Galen Wright writes that the program began at Iran Electronics Industries in the mid-1980s and began mass production in 1986, with possible use in the Iran–Iraq War.  Design  Artist's impression of an Ababil-R being launched from a pneumatic truck launcher. The Ababil has a cylindrical fuselage, a sweptback vertical fin, and a pusher engine. It is powered by a simple two- bladed pusher propeller with a rear-mounted wing and a front canard for good stall, stability and maneuverability characteristics. All variants have a range of over 100 km and all variants have all-metal construction, except for the Ababil-T, which is composite (fiberglass). The Ababil can be launched from a zero-length JATO platform or a Mercedes Benz 911 pneumatic truck launcher. The rocket launch system can be used from a ship deck and can be assembled or broken down for portability. For recovery, a parachute provides a descent rate of 4 m/s, or skids can be used for conventional landings on a runway or field. Some airframes have also been seen with landing gear.  Variants  The Ababil is built in a number of poorly documented variants.  Ababil-1  The Ababil-1 was an obscure loitering munition built in the 1980s. Its specifications are not known, there are no known photographs, and it is unknown if it was ever used in combat. It is believed to be out of service.  Ababil-2  Artist's impression of Ababil-2 The Ababil-2 has an improved flight-control system. Jane's reports that the Ababil-2 had its first flight in 1997 while Galen Wright writes that it entered production in 1992. Both sources agree the Ababil-2 was publicly revealed in 1999. Some sources also designate the Ababil-2 as the Ababil-II. = Target drone = The most common Ababil-2 variant is a target drone variant used for training air- defense crews. The name of Ababil variants is unclear, but Jane's reports that this variant is called the Ababil-B. The Ababil-B's mission payloads are acoustic miss-distance-indicators, IR devices, and radar reflectors. This variant is the oldest Ababil-2 variant and it apparently entered service in 2001.Interavia: Business & Technology, Issues 649-659 (2001) = Surveillance = An Iranian Ababil-B on a JATO launcher. The name of the Ababil-2 surveillance variant is similarly unclear, but Jane's reports that this is called the Ababil-S. Some sources may also designate this the Ababil-R. Galen Wright assesses it as having \\"only rudimentary\\" surveillance capabilities in contrast to other intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance UAVs. = Twin-tail variant = The Ababil-2 also exists in a twin-tail variant, which some (but not all) sources name the Ababil-T. This variant can be fitted with surveillance, target drone, or disposable strike munition payloads. It is probably coterminous with the \\"Mirsad-1\\" UAV operated by Hezbollah and may have been renamed \\"Qasef-1\\" in Houthi service. = Ababil-CH = The Ababil- CH has two rear tails, like the Ababil-T, but is used as a target drone like the Ababil-B. It is slightly larger than the Ababil-T. = Qasef-1 = The Qasef-1 loitering munition is based on the Ababil-2 airframe and has a 30-kg warhead. It has been solely operated by Yemeni Houthis, who have mostly used it to attack the radar components of MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missiles. The Qasef-1 has been in use since late 2016 and some examples have been intercepted in transit to Yemen. It is possibly a renamed or modified Ababil-T with an installed explosive charge or a warhead. The Houthis claim that they manufacture Qasef-1s themselves, but this claim has been disputed and there is widespread suspicion that it is Iranian-built. An Iranian Ababil-3. Note that with a mid-body wing, twin tailbooms, and horizontal tail, the Ababil-3 is very different from other Ababils.  Ababil-3  The Ababil-3 is a complete redesign of the Ababil with an improved airframe used solely for surveillance: it carries better equipment and can stay aloft for longer. Some sources also designate the Ababil-3 as the Ababil-III. The Ababil-3 is thought to be based on the South African Denel Dynamics Seeker, and possibly the Seeker-2D model in particular. It is more widely exported than the Ababil-2, and is known to have entered production by 2008, with specific parts manufactured by 2006. The Ababil-3 can collect real-time video. The Ababil-3 has a cylindrical body, with wings mounted on top while at the end of the body is an H-shaped twin boom. The wing design is a rectangle which after half its lengths tapers toward the wing tips. The Ababil-3's wingspan is about 7 meters, compared to 3 meters for the Ababil-2. It uses an engine from German company Limbach Flugmotoren, possibly the Limbach L550E. Other sources suggest the Ababil-3 is powered by Chinese or Iranian clones of the L550. Other particular parts inside the Ababil-3 were sourced from Irish defense contractors. The Ababil-T's fiberglass construction, seen here in a Qasef-1 recovered from Houthis in Yemen, is clearly visible. Analysis of an Ababil-3 downed over ISIS-held territory in Iraq, apparently due to mechanical failure, finds that the Ababil-3 is built out of composite materials. The powerplant had plain- surfaced cylinder heads; it was unclear if the engine was manufactured in Iran or China. Overall, the manufacture was \\"very economical\\" and the Ababil-3 was designed for low cost. There were also a number of defects in the downed Ababil-3 model, which could suggest poor manufacture or handling in the field. Ababil-3s are based at an airstrip outside of Minab, a town near Bandar Abbas. Ababil-3s are also known to be based at Bandar Abbas International Airport. The Ababil-3 is comparable with the RQ-2. The Ababil-3's max airspeed is , its range is (roundtrip), and it has a service ceiling of . It has an endurance of 4 hours. An estimated 217 Ababil-3s have been built as of July 2019.https://twitter.com/imp_navigator/status/1153016472479916032 In 2014 Iran announced that they had developed night vision capabilities for the Ababil-3.Iranian-made Ababil-3 Swallow-3 drone is now equipped with night vision capability – Armyrecognition.com, 2 July 2014 Previous Ababil variants were most effective in daytime.

Operational history   Lebanon  Wreckage of the Hezbollah Ababil-2 launched August 7, 2006. Hezbollah acquired Ababil-2 drones (twin-tail variant) in 2002, and operated them under the Mirsad-1 designation. Israel has said that Hezbollah received at least 12 Ababils before the 2006 Lebanon War. Three Ababils were launched during the conflict. The first Ababil was shot down by an Israeli F-16 on 7 August 2006 off the coast of Northern Israel. The second Ababil crashed inside Lebanon on 13 August. The third Ababil deployed by Hezbollah was shot down by another F-16 hours later just inside Israel's northern border. Hezbollah was assessed as having several Ababil UAVs in 2009, although other estimates have ranged from 12 to 24-30. By 2018, Hezbollah stated that the Mirsad-1 had been retired from service. Hezbollah has also built a large airstrip in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. There is speculation that the airstrip could support larger, runway- launched Ababil-3 UAVs. Hezbollah is not definitively known to operate the Ababil-3.  Sudan  The Ababil-3 is in service with Sudan. In 2008, an Ababil-3 crashed or was shot down while on a surveillance mission. On March 13, 2012 another Sudanese Ababil was lost in action near Toroji, South Kordofan. Sudanese rebels of the SPLA-N said they downed it using ground fire, while the Sudanese government said it was due to mechanical failure.  Iraq  The underside of an Ababil-2. On 16 March 2009, an American F-16 operating in Iraq shot down an Iranian Ababil 3 drone on 25 February 2009 that had been flying through Iraqi airspace for \\"almost an hour and 10 minutes.\\" The drone crashed about 60 miles northeast of Baghdad, 12 miles inside Iraqi territory near the town of Balad Ruz in Diyala Governorate. Officials at Iraq's Defence and Interior ministries suggested that the drone might have been scouting for routes to smuggle Iranian weapons into the country.Shadid, Anthony, \\"U.S. Downed Iranian Drone Over Iraq\\", The Washington Post, p. 9. The New York Times, however, speculated that the drone was monitoring Iranian dissidents in Iraq, such as those at Camp Ashraf, which is located near where the drone crashed.Nordland, Rod, and Alissa J. Rubin, \\"U.S. Says It Shot Down An Iranian Drone Over Iraq\\", The New York Times, March 17, 2009. Abdul Aziz Mohammed Jassim, head of military operations at the Iraqi defence ministry stated that since the drone, \\"crossed 10 km into Iraq, it's most likely that its entrance was a mistake.\\" More recently, Ababil-3 UAVs have been used extensively in the Iraqi Civil War. Their use began in summer 2014, shortly after the Fall of Mosul, from Rasheed Air Base.  Iran  Iran is the primary operator of Ababil UAVs. Iran operates large numbers of Ababil-2 UAVs, mostly for training air defense crews, and operates Ababil-3 UAVs for surveillance use.  Syria  Ababil-3 UAVs have been used in the Syrian Civil War since 2012.Dan Gettinger, (December 2016) Drones Operating in Syria and Iraq. Bard College They have been used heavily and are some of the most commonly used UAVs in the war. They are especially commonly seen over Damascus.  Palestine  On 14 December 2014, Hamas militants flew an unmanned air vehicle over a parade in the Gaza Strip marking the 27th anniversary of the organization's establishment. Israeli sources identified the aircraft as an Iranian-made Ababil.  Yemen  Wreckage of a Qasef-1 from Yemen. Houthi rebels have operated Ababil-T loitering munitions under the name \\"Qasef-1\\" to target Saudi and Emirati radar batteries. According to the Houthis, a new variant of the drone named \\"Qasef-2K\\" has been designed to explode from a height of 20 meters in the air and rain shrapnel down on its target and has been used to kill 6 people in the coalition controlled Al Anad Air Base in Yemen.

Etymology The name is first attested in 1195 as \\"Burteg\\" and, around 1200, as \\"Burcheleia\\" which is more representative of other medieval attestations. The name derives from Old English burh, a 'fortification' and lēah an 'open space in woodland'.A. H. Smith, The Place-Names of the West Riding of Yorkshire, English Place-Name Society, 30–37, 8 vols (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1961–63), IV 140-41. History Cardigan Arms Burley grew from a village in the late industrial revolution, and there are several streets including the word 'village' including The Village Street. The area from The Village Street in the west to the railway line in the east, and north of Burley Road forms the Village Conservation Area. Parts of the original village can still be seen at the junction of Burley Road and Haddon Road, and around Burley Lodge. Most houses constructed in Burley were of red-brick, but were generally smaller and largely back-to-backs. Industrial and commercial buildings were also largely brick-built. There are some larger stone-built buildings on Kirkstall Road such as the ornate Cardigan Arms public house—although this largely pre-dates most of the buildings in the area—which at the time of its construction only Burley Village existed, with the Arms somewhat outside. Mills along the River Aire were built towards the end of the 19th century, some of which remain standing. Housing for mill workers and others in surrounding areas followed, and homes were built further up the bank. Other industries in the area included printing, clock-making,History of Potts of Leeds , accessed 24 February 2018 dairies and chemicals. Before 1904, local government was handled by the civil parish of Headingley-cum-Burley. Thereafter, the area was incorporated into the parish of Leeds.1911 Census of England and Wales, Table 13, 'Changes in the boundaries of civil parishes during the intercensal period 1901-11; effected under the provisions of the Local Government Acts of 1888 and 1894, and by Local Acts'.; LGBO 45137 via The ecclesiastical parish of Burley still exists. The boundaries of the ecclesiastical parish are very close to those of the postcode area LS4, so LS4 is often used as an indicator of being in Burley, although LS4 also includes a small area that is in the ecclesiastical parish of Kirkstall. The area remained working class for many decades but the growth of the University of Leeds and Leeds Metropolitan University in the late 20th century brought a growing student population to Burley and the surrounding areas of Hyde Park, and Headingley. In the mid- to late 2000s student halls were built along the lower parts of Burley Road. The opening of the Leeds Studios in 1968 by Yorkshire Television provided the first major non-manufacturing employer. Yorkshire Television and Radio Aire broadcast studios, and the Home Office's Immigration offices, are on Kirkstall Road in Burley. Community Village Shop St Matthias' Church is situated to the south-east of the old village. Built in 1854, it is a stone church with spire, and was designated a Grade II listed building on 5 August 1976.\\"Church of St Matthias\\", British Listed Buildings St. Simon's Church, funded by Edmund Denison-Beckett MP, was located on Ventnor Street History of St. Chad's, accessed 25 December 2017 but was closed as part of a clearance scheme in the 1960s.Leodis - a photographic archive of Leeds, St. Simon's Church of England School Rugby League Team, accessed 24 February 2018 Burley public houses and members' clubs include The Cardigan Arms, Bridgewater Arms, The Merry Monk (now closed),Housing plan for the Leeds Merry Monk pub site, 12 January 2018 accessed 24 February 2018 Burley Social Club and Burley Conservative Club. There are three gyms, a 5-aside football centre and a nine-hole golf course. Burley Branch Library was open on Cardigan Road between 1926 and 2016, closing due to the poor condition of the building. The area is served by small supermarkets (Iceland, Asda, Co-op and Aldi), and small chains such as One- Stop, Costcutter and Premier. The main shopping area is on Kirkstall Road and Burley Hill, where there are shops and restaurants. Cardigan Fields leisure park complex contains a multi-screen cinema, a nightclub, a gymnasium, a 10-pin Bowling, a public house, and an ALDI supermarket. Restaurants include Pizza Hut, McDonald's and Nando's. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal and River Aire form Burley's southern boundary, and are popular with walkers, cyclists and fishermen. Burley Model Allotments, in what was once a quarry, has more than 100 plots and is bisected by Beechwood Crescent. The allotments have existed since 26 August 1892 when Leeds City Council acquired the site. It was replanned in 1956 and 1957 and on 26 June 1958 they were re-opened as Burley Model Allotments by the Lord Mayor of Leeds. Local artists open their homes as galleries to display their work as part of Triangle Art Day. Housing Village Terrace Burley is characterised by red brick Victorian terraces including small back-to-back houses and through terraces. In the 20th century private houses were built including semi-detached houses around the Burley Wood. There are pockets of 20th-century council houses including a small estate of prefabricated concrete houses on Burley Road near the Yorkshire Television studios and an estate closer to Kirkstall. Burley has a student population in private rented accommodation and in the mid- to late 2000s large scale student halls were built on Burley Road and owned and operated by the Opal Group. Transport Burley is linked to Leeds city centre by the A65 and Burley Roads. The railway came to Burley with the opening of the Harrogate Line in 1848 but Burley Park railway station was only opened in 1988; until then the nearest station was Headingley railway station. The station connects Burley with the city centre, Headingley, Horsforth, Harrogate, Knaresborough and York. First Leeds' 15, 19, 19A, 33, 33A, 49, 50 and 50A bus services link Burley with the city centre, Bradford, Farsley, Horsforth, Ireland Wood, Tinshill, Kirkstall, Headingley, Bramley, Garforth, Guiseley, Menston, Otley, St James' Hospital and Seacroft. Until 1959 the Leeds Tramway ran through Burley. Sport Queens ARLFC play in the Pennine League Premier Division and have headquarters at Burley Social Club. Burley United play their games at West Park football fields, playing in Division 1 of the Sunday League. Burley RUFC play in Yorkshire Division 4 and play their matches next to Kirkstall Abbey.

From its official opening on 1 July 1904 initial thematical leanings were towards the natural sciences, although galleries of the local Linthorpe Pottery, work by eminent Victorian industrial designer Christopher Dresser and the history of Middlesbrough, have largely replaced this emphasis. The remains of the original Victorian/Edwardian collection of stuffed and mounted animals is now in a single room, the Nelson Room, and consists of various taxidermied birds in their original cases with painted decorative backgrounds, and a variety of birds' eggs. The museum was founded by Sir Arthur Dorman of the Dorman Long engineering company in honour of his son George Lockwood Dorman, who died of enteric fever at Kroonstad in the Second Boer War. It is one of two cultural institutions run by Middlesbrough Borough Council along with the Captain Cook Birthplace Museum. Having undergone major refurbishment and extension it reopened in 2003 and is home to a wide variety of collections. Visiting the museum The Dorman Museum is a free venue, however there may be small charges applied for special events and activities. Opening times are Tuesday to Sunday 10:30 am to 3:30 pm. The Dorman Museum has 8 permanent display galleries and a changing temporary exhibition spaces on the ground floor. Small exhibitions also take place within the ground floor corridor. Access to the upper floor is by the main staircase or lift.http://www.dormanmuseum.co.uk/visit/ The museum also benefits from a Victorian style tearoom on the ground floor, named Dresser's Tea Room, which serves sandwiches, cakes, hot and cold drinks, and afternoon tea. Original collection The original collection included items such as a stuffed and mounted eagle owl in the act of taking a hare, a stuffed lion in a \\"rampant\\" pose, and many birds' eggs, butterflies, and insects preserved under glass and in drawers, with covers over the glass to avoid the effects of light on the specimens. One particular specimen case could shock the unwary, as it contained a model, at least 100 times normal size, of a human head louse. At about the same time, the museum possessed a fossil of an ichthyosaur. There was also a stuffed ribbonfish, of a species a few metres in length. One of the first contributors to the museum was Henry Bolckow, founder of Middlesbrough's largest ironworks, Bolckow Vaughan, who paid for some stuffed birds in 1874. Christopher Dresser Dresser Cruet Set Christopher Dresser was a pivotal figure in the Aesthetic Movement and deeply involved in the Linthorpe Art Pottery, which stood less than a mile from Dorman Museum. The museum has a significant Dresser collection and a Heritage Lottery Fund project exists to draw attention to this. In 2014, the newly refurbished gallery dedicated to Christopher Dresser opened, showcasing 160 works produced directly from his designs, as well as those produced by others influenced by his work, and the collection continues to be extended. The extensive collection was purchased from a private collector with the financial support of Heritage Lottery Fund, Art Fund and Victoria and Albert Museum Purchase Grant Fund, bringing a significant collection into the public domain and safeguarding it for future generations. The Linthorpe Art Pottery gallery also reopened after extensive work and now showcases the largest public collection of Linthorpe wares in the world. The museum also runs an education and activity programme relating to the Dresser and Linthorpe collections. Other artefacts Roseberry Topping hoardA popular seasonal item in the 1960s was a beehive in an acrylic glass case with an exit through a side window, allowing visitors to the museum to see the bees at work in the hive. The Dorman Museum has material including a library of archaeological journals and photographs taken by Frank Elgee during his excavations. Principally at The Bronze Age Hill fort at Eston Nab and burial grounds at Loose Howe, also, a dug-out canoe recovered from the River Tees at a depth of eight feet in 1926 is on view at the museum. A green plaque dedicated to Frank Elgee, the curator between 1923 and 1932, is on view at the entrance.

At the corner of Vulcan Streethttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vulcan_Street_- _geograph.org.uk_-_90459.jpg and Dock Street, buildings stood in the mid-19th century directly facing on to the river bank which is now perhaps 100 m away across land reclaimed from waste slag created by Bolchow and Vaughan Ironworks, the first on Middlesbrough. The first building (up to the double gates) was original a sail loft for servicing the sailing vessels coming into the docks. Prior to demolition a hoist was discovered in the roof space which would have been used to lift the sails from ground to first floor level where large windows provided plenty of natural light. The hoist has now been removed to Dorman Museum. Archive and Ephemera – The museum has archived materials related to the wider collections.

Estaus Palace is the large building in the upper left corner of the square. Baroque-style Inquisition Palace before burning in 1836. The Estaus Palace (; ) in Rossio Square, in Lisbon, was the headquarters of the Portuguese Inquisition. The original palace was built on the north side of the square around 1450 as lodging for foreign dignitaries and noblemen visiting Lisbon. Portuguese Inquisition In 1536, during the reign of King John III, the Inquisition was installed in Portugal, and the palace eventually became the seat of the institution. The palace had a prison and tribunal where the accused of heresy, witchcraft, and, particularly of secretly practising the Jewish faith (New Christians), were subjected to trial, persecution, torture, and execution. Rossio square and nearby St. Domingos square were frequently used as setting for public executions. The first official auto-da-fé took place in 1540. Among the thousands of people accused by the Inquisition and held in the prison of the Estaus are important personalities like historian Damião de Góis, poet Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage and dramatist António José da Silva, nicknamed \\"the Jew\\", executed by the Inquisition in 1737. The Inquisition Palace was heavily damaged in the catastrophic 1755 Lisbon earthquake, but was rebuilt under designs by Carlos Mardel. This building was destroyed by fire in 1836. The Inquisition was not abolished in Portugal until 1821. Teatro Nacional D. Maria II Thanks to the efforts of writer Almeida Garrett, the palace was replaced in 1842 by the Teatro Nacional D.

Donaldson, the second book of the first trilogy of The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant series. It is followed by The Power that Preserves. Plot summary Several weeks after returning to his world from The Land, the leper Thomas Covenant is taking a phone call from his ex-wife Joan when he falls and hits his head, waking to find himself back in the Land, in the chamber of the Council of Lords of Revelstone. Angered by the fact that he has been transported away from \\"reality\\", Covenant nevertheless believes he is once again experiencing a dream or delusion due to his head injury. His hypothesis is supported by the fact that the Land has seen the passing of forty years compared to the few weeks that have passed in his own world: the High Lord of the Council is Elena. Much later he learns that she is his daughter, born of his rape of Lena. Due to the trauma, Lena has disassociated from life and reverted to a childlike mentality, fully dependent on her family. Elena is now Covenant's summoner and shows no ill will towards her biological father. She and Covenant become close friends. Elena explains that the evil Lord Foul has assembled a massive army, with which he now threatens the people of The Land. For forty years, the Lords have dedicated themselves to the study of Kevin's Lore, training new students at the school at the tree city of Revelwood. Only Mhorham remains from Lords of the council during the quest for the Staff of Law, but seven new Lords have taken their seats, having mastered both the magical and martial arts. The horse-tending Ramen have been enlisted to patrol the frontier near Foul's dominions. The Warward, the army of Revelstone, is full of battle-ready volunteers and is led by Hile Troy, who came to the Land from Covenant's world. An attempt was even made to attack Lord Foul directly, via a commando raid on his lair at the Land's eastern edge; although the raid, led by Lord Mhoram, failed, valuable knowledge was gained about Foul's forces. The commander of Foul's army is one of three brothers of the race of Giants, a people previously thought incorruptible. With the aid of the powerful Illearth Stone, Foul's non-corporeal servants, the Ravers, have possessed the three brothers, now renamed Kinslaughterer, Fleshharrower and Satansfist. In shame and despair, the other Giants offer no resistance as Kinslaughterer murders them all in their home city. Thus, the Lords have lost their strongest and bravest ally in the fight against evil. Nevertheless, the Lords resolve to meet the enemy on the battlefield. Hile Troy is a genius in military tactics who developed a mystical form of sight when hurtloam, a magical mud with miraculous curative properties, was used to try and \\"heal\\" his lack of eyes. (The hurtloam used to heal Covenant's head injury also has the effect of \\"curing\\" his leprosy.) While Troy leads the army to confront Fleshharrower's attacking force, Elena and Covenant go in search of the Seventh Ward, a repository of ancient magical power which Elena believes will ensure victory. Covenant, Elena and their two Bloodguard protectors journey through the remote mountain region on the western frontier of the Land to the hiding place of the Ward. Elena gains the power, but foolishly uses it to summon the long dead High Lord Kevin from his grave, and send him against Lord Foul. This act breaks the Law of Death, the barrier preventing the souls of the dead from interfering in the world of the living. Kevin's spirit is easily defeated and then enslaved by Foul wielding the Illearth Stone, and commanded to destroy Elena. The two High Lords engage in a battle of magic, in which Elena and her Bloodguard are defeated and killed, and the Staff of Law lost again. Covenant is able to save himself and his Bloodguard by using the power of his white gold ring, again without understanding how. Meanwhile, Hile Troy has been forced into a desperate retreat by the superior force of the Raver's army to the edge of a dangerous, forbidding forest known as Garroting Deep. In desperation, he and Lord Mhoram beg the aid of Caerroil Wildwood, an immortal Forestal who is charged with protecting the ancient forests of the Land from the Ravers. Wildwood brings the forest to life, totally destroying Foul's army, and personally garrotes Fleshharrower. The victory is a Pyrrhic one, however: the Lords' army is nearly obliterated, three Lords besides Elena have been killed, and Hile Troy has sacrificed himself as the price for the Forestal's aid, becoming Wildwood's immortal apprentice. The war thus ends in a draw, and with the death of High Lord Elena his summoner, Covenant once again returns to his own world. His ex-wife has long since hung up the phone, and he is a leper once more.

The Theatre building was as a Property of Public Interest in 1928, and has been reclassified as National Monument since 2003.  Architecture  The building is the best representative of Neoclassical architecture of Palladian influence in Lisbon. The main feature of the façade is a portico (hexastyle) with six Ionic columns reused from the Saint Francis Convent of Lisbon and a triangular pediment. The tympanum of the pediment is decorated with a sculpted relief showing Apollo and the Muses. The pediment is topped by a statue of Renaissance playwright Gil Vicente (c. 1464-c. 1536), considered the founder of Portuguese theatre. Ironically, some of Gil Vicente's plays had been censured by the Portuguese Inquisition in the late 16th century. The interior of the theatre was decorated by many important 19th-century Portuguese artists, but much of this decoration was lost in a fire in 1964.

The 4A9 is Mitsubishi's first four-cylinder engine family to adopt a high-pressure die-cast aluminum block.\\"Colt Plus gets MDC Power\\", Jack Yamaguchi, SAE International All engines developed within this family have aluminum cylinder block and head, four valves per cylinder, double overhead camshaft layouts, and MIVEC continuous variable valve timing (intake only). Engine family characteristics For high output and low fuel consumption, the MIVEC system and other measures (including optimized shaping of the intake and exhaust manifolds and cylinder head) were used to promote intake and exhaust efficiency. Optimally shaped cooling passages in the cylinder head and optimal control of the flow of coolant into the cylinder head help to suppress engine knocking. Comprehensive measures to engine components were taken to minimize friction. For lightness and compactness; design optimization, material optimization, and component integration were identified as effective means of minimizing weight and bulk, so they were comprehensively effected in combination with each other. With regard to materials, the cylinder block is made of aluminum; the cylinder-head cover and intake manifold are made of plastic; the exhaust manifold has a pipe-based structure and cams driven by a timing chain. Component integration was applied in many areas of the engine. Notably, the functions of engine accessories were integrated into the cylinder block. Exhaust emissions from the engine are minimized by measures including optimal design of the combustion chambers, optimal control of the intake air motion by means of the cylinder-head ports, employment of the MIVEC system, employment of an ultra-thin cylinder head gasket, and employment of micro-droplet fuel injectors. The vehicle's overall exhaust emissions are further suppressed by location of the exhaust manifold at the rear of the engine. This layout is beneficial since it minimizes the heat capacity of the exhaust system upstream of the catalytic converter and thus, together with combustion control, promotes activation of the catalytic converter. 4A91's DOHC camshafts are driven by a single-stage roller chain of pitch and width, instead of the previous 4G15's cogged belt drive. Camshafts act directly on bucket-type tappets. The intake camshaft is fitted with a continuously variable cam-phasing, altering timing up to 50 degrees. Valves are inclined at an included angle of 34 degrees versus the 4G15's wider 45 degrees. 4A90 Specifications Engine type — OHC 16v, ECI multiple Displacement — Bore pitch — Bore — Stroke — Compression ratio — 10.5:1 Power — at 6000 rpm Torque — at 4000 rpm Applications *2004 Mitsubishi Colt *2004–2006 Smart Forfour *2011 Haima 2 *2014 BAIC Up *2016 DFM Joyear X3 *Zotye Z200 4A91 4A91 engine in the 2019 Nissan Livina Specifications Engine type — DOHC 16v, ECI multiple Displacement — Bore pitch — Bore — Stroke — Compression ratio — 10.5:1 Power — at 6000 rpm Torque — at 4000 rpm Applications *2004 Mitsubishi Colt *2007 Mitsubishi Lancer *2004–2006 Smart Forfour *2009–2019 Soueast V3 *2010 Brilliance FSV *2011 Haima 2 *2012 Senova D20 *2013–present Soueast V5 *2013–present Zotye Z300 *2014 Senova D50 *2014–present Zotye SR7 *2015–present BAIC BJ20 *2016–present Ario S300 *2016 Brilliance V5 *2016 Senova X55 *2016 Yema T70 SUV *2017 Soueast DX3 *Zotye Z200 *2017–present Soueast DX7 *2017–present Mitsubishi Xpander *2019–present Nissan Livina 4A92 Specifications Engine type — DOHC 16v,ECI multiple Displacement — Bore pitch — Bore — Stroke — Compression ratio — 11.0:1 Power — at 6000 rpm Torque — at 4000 rpm Applications *2010 Mitsubishi ASX (EU) * 2011 Mitsubishi Lancer (EU) * 2013 Mitsubishi Lancer (PH) * 2011 Brilliance H530 * 2012 Brilliance V5 * 2012 Zotye Z300 (1.5/1.6L) *2017/2018 DFM Joyear X3 See also * List of Mitsubishi engines References External links * 4A9 Inline-four engines Gasoline engines by model ","title":"Mitsubishi 4A9 engine"},{"id":"6391382","text":"Spuž (Montenegrin Cyrillic: Спуж) is a small town seated near Zeta river, within the Danilovgrad Municipality in the central Montenegrin region.

The game, which came packaged in a clear plastic 8.5\\"x11\\" bag, consisted a 17\\" x 22\\" three-color hex-based terrain map, a sheet of 100 cardstock counters, rules book, and folio cover sheet. It was also sold as a part of a four-game boxed set entitled Blue and Gray. The sales channel strategy was to primarily sell the game through specialized wargaming, hobby and board game retail stores, as well as through mail order catalogue sales directly from SPI. The wargame covered a ground scale of 400 meters per hex, and each game turn represents 1-2 hours. Game mechanics are fairly simplistic, with a standard \\"move/combat/advance and retreat\\" format, with rigid zones of control. One player commands elements of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia and the other takes the Union Army of the Potomac. Game turns are sequential, and a major strategy is to cut off the opponent's lines of retreat by positioning the counters to take advantage of the zones of control. Counters represent brigades and list the unit's strength factors (firepower). The combat results table is based upon a combination of the ratio of the attacker's strength to the defender's, coupled with a random dice roll. Results include either the attacker or defender being forced to retreat, or a loss of strength (the higher the numerical advantage in strength, the greater the odds of a successful result). The average game lasted 2 to 2.5 hours in playing time. The Blue and Gray folio series was a popular seller, with a number of individual titles.

The Church is a late medieval structure built by the local chieftain of the time, Gilbert O'Flanagan II, and his wife Margaret in 1483 in 'Honour of God and Mary'. The O'Flanagan sept, who supplied many of the clergy for both Devenish and Inishmacsaint, were the chieftains of Tuatha Rátha. The territory of Tuatha Rátha covered approximately the area which is known today as the Barony of Magheraboy and their stronghold was situated at Baile Uí Fhlanagain in the townland of Aghamore on the shores of Carrick Lake.Bell, Robert; The Book of Ulster Surnames, page 68. The Black Staff Press, 2003. Much trouble plagued the descendants of O'Flanagan and the Annals of Ulster record that in 1528 Gilleece O'Flanagan and his son Turlough were both murdered in the chapel, on the same day, by Patrick O'Flanagan. Gilbert II may have built a church at Aghamore (the Great Field) as a private chapel but it raises the question; did he have a difference with his kinsman who was Prior on Inishmacsaint or did he build it for prestige? Gilbert II died in 1496 and when his wife Margaret, who was a daughter of the ruling house of the Maguires of Fermanagh, died, she was buried at the Abbey in Donegal. Carrick Church may have existed as a place of worship for the local people until penal times as there is no record of any other Roman Catholic place of worship in the area. Inishmacsaint church was taken over by the planters as Hume, the local landlord, did not build a church until 1688 at Drumenag. Despite the condition of the dangerous ruins the graveyard was utilized by the locals until around 1930. Many gravestones litter the grounds and some late 18th century inscriptions are still visible on the markers. Nearby to this ruin, there is a well by the name of Tobarnasuil, from the Irish Tobar na Súil, meaning \\"well of the eyes\\". Its water is said to have healing powers to cure ailments of the eye. Carrick Church and graveyard, in Aghamore townland, grid ref: H0962 5388, are Scheduled Historic Monuments.

Pre-AFL  Gibbs was an exceptional youth talent, which led to much speculation about his ultimate AFL drafting.The Canberra Times Chosen one makes his mark Camp spotlight shines on Gibbs In 2004 he won Glenelg's Under 17s best and fairest award, despite spending part of the season playing SANFL reserve grade. That year he also captained the South Australian under 16s team at the national championships. From round 7 of the 2005 season, at age 16, he debuted in Glenelg's League team and was a regular until the end of the 2006 season. Playing as a teenager against grown men in the SANFL, Gibbs excelled, coming third in the club's 2006 best and fairest and dominating recent former AFL players during the season.Gibbs' AFL appetite growing He featured prominently in the 2006 under-18 national championships where he was captain of South Australia. He was selected as the All-Australian ruck rover and was judged South Australia's Most Valuable Player. He also co-captained the Australian youth side against an Irish youth side in an international tournament in Australia in 2006. Recruitment Speculation that Gibbs would be the No. 1 draft pick began early in the 2006 season. Although his father Ross Gibbs had a 253-game career with Glenelg, Bryce was ineligible to be taken by the Adelaide Crows under the Father-Son Rule, much to the Crows' chagrin, because Ross had not yet played 200 of those games before the Crows entered the Australian Football League in 1991. When Essendon and Carlton met in round 16 of 2006, the sides were firmly entrenched at the bottom of the ladder, with Carlton having lost its last seven games and Essendon a then-club-record fourteen. Speculation that the result would decide the wooden spoon (and hence the first draft pick) led to the game jokingly being dubbed the \\"Bryce Gibbs Cup\\" by some in the media.Passionate, skilful, hungry and smart Gibbs a kid with the lot Retrieved from The Herald Sun 12 November 2006 The match ended in a draw. Carlton ultimately finished last, and subsequently selected Gibbs with the first overall pick in the 2006 AFL Draft (held on 25 November 2006). He was given the No. 4 guernsey, formerly worn by club champion and administrator (and later, president), Stephen Kernahan, who was also close friend and former Glenelg teammate of Gibbs' father. AFL career Gibbs was named in Carlton's leadership group for the 2007 AFL season without having played a single AFL match, which is the first time in history this has happened. He made his debut in round one against Richmond and kicked a goal with his first kick while becoming the 1100th player to play for Carlton. 17 disposals at 100 percent efficiency and a great shut-down role on Brownlow Medallist Jason Akermanis in round 10 earned Gibbs his nomination for the NAB Rising Star award. Gibbs played every game of the 2007 season and kicked five goals. Most of his development and experience has been in the backline where he has played as a half back flanker. Gibbs in 2017. In 2008, new coach Brett Ratten reduced the size of the leadership group, and Gibbs was excluded from the new group. Gibbs played games as both an attacking midfielder and as a tagger throughout the season, playing very well in both roles. As a tagger, he convincingly beat several top-class opponents, including Chad Cornes (nine disposals), Heath Shaw (six disposals) and Adam Goodes, whom he held to seven disposals while collecting 26 of his own. In the midfield, he showed strong team ethic, very accurate disposal by foot, strong tackling, and very good football smarts and awareness. He collected seven Brownlow votes during the season and finished 5th in the club best and fairest. In 2009, Gibbs began playing mainly as an attacking midfielder, and much less as a tagger. He finished the season with a total of 615 disposals (averaging 26.7) which was ranked ninth in the league, and polled 15 votes in the Brownlow Medal to finish equal ninth, and finished third in the club best and fairest. In 2010, Gibbs began to divide his time between the midfield and the half-back line, playing as a rebounding defender. In round 10, his 45 disposals tied Greg Williams' efforts as the most by a Carlton player in a single game (since records were kept in 1984).http://afltables.com/afl/stats/teams/allteams/playershi.html Gibbs finished fourth in the club best and fairest for 2010.Carlton Football Club Judd in John Nicholls Medal threepeat , Retrieved 28 September 2010 In 2011, Gibbs celebrated his 100 games for Carlton against the Brisbane Lions.

He was the son of Conis (or Chonis) and Saint Patrick's sister, Darerca. Saint Darerca was known as the \\"mother of saints\\" because most of her children (seventeen sons and two daughters) entered religious life, many were later recognized as saints, and several of her sons became bishops. Mél and his brothers Melchu, Munis and Rioch accompanied their uncle Patrick to Ireland and helped him with his missionary work there. Mél and his brother Melchu were both reportedly consecrated bishop by Patrick himself. After St Patrick built the church at Ardagh, he appointed Mél as Bishop of Ardagh. According to the Life of St. Brigid, Mél is said to have had no fixed see for most of his life in ministry, which fits with other accounts of his being a traveling missionary and evangelist. Acting upon the apostolic precept, Mél supported himself by working with his hands; what he gained beyond bare necessities, he gave to the poor. Life Church of St Mél, Ardagh Mél helped evangelize Ireland while supporting himself through manual labor. Patrick appointed Mél as one of the earliest Irish bishops and head of the Diocese of Ardagh. Mél also built the monastery of Ardagh where he was both bishop and abbot, and is said to have had the gift of prophecy.O'Hanlon, Rev. John, M.R.I.A., Lives of the Irish Saints, Vol. II, Dublin: James Duffy and Sons, 1875 He accepted Saint Brigid of Kildare's profession as a nun, and served as her mentor while she was in Ardagh. Mél lived with his aunt, Lupait, on her farm during a portion of his ministry, and rumor spread that their relationship was of a scandalous nature. St. Patrick went to investigate. Mél and Lupait both produced miracles to testify to their innocence: Mel plowed up a live fish in the middle of his field, and Lupait carried hot coals without being burned. He died in AD 488. Veneration There is a lot of confusing and conflicting evidence about the life of St. Mél, including the possibility that he and Melchu were the same person. Mel has a strong cultus in County Longford where he was the first abbot-bishop of a richly endowed monastery that flourished for centuries. The cathedral at Longford is dedicated to Mél, as is a college. A crozier, believed to have belonged to Saint Mél, was found in the 19th century at Ardagh near the old church of St Mél. The crozier is now kept in a darkened bronze reliquary that was once decorated with gilt and colored stones which was burned in the 2009 fire that destroyed the cathedral. He is the patron saint of the Roman Catholic diocese of Ardagh and Clonmacnois. St. Mél's feast day, 7 February, has begun to be observed as a holiday for single people. \\"St. Mél's Day\\" is a chance for singles to celebrate the good things about being single. Traditions include sending yourself a St. Mel's Day card and for people to host parties for their single friends.Masterson, Rachel. \\"Celebrating singledom on the feast of St Mel\\", Longford Leader, 7 February 2014 References External links *St. Mél Romano-British saints 488 deaths People from County Longford Irish Christian monks 5th-century Christian saints Medieval saints of Meath Year of birth unknown ","title":"Mél of Ardagh"},{"id":"6391475","text":"Saint Fintan of Clonenagh (CA. 526 - 603) was an Irish hermit and monk.

The monastery at Clonenagh was founded in the 6th century by Fintan of Clonenagh who entrusted it to his disciple Columba when Colum moved on to Terryglass around 548.

It is one of two institutions managed by Middlesbrough Council along with the Dorman Museum. The museum opened on 28 October 1978, the 250th anniversary of the birth in the same spot of British naval explorer and circumnavigator Captain James Cook. A biographical museum, it champions and surveys his life, times and subsequent journeys. This pink granite urn is inscribed with the text \\"This granite urn was erected by H.W.F. Bolkow of Marton Hall A.D. 1852 to mark the site of the cottage in which Captain James Cook the world circumnavigator was born Oct 27th 1728\\" Location on Wikimapia Prior to its existence, visitors to the Park had long already been enlightened as to the location's historical significance by the erection by local industrialist and mayor Henry Bolckow of a granite urn in the 1850s bearing Cook's name, within what were then the grounds of his own residence, Marton Hall. Marton Hall was destroyed by fire in 1960 during demolition, with only a surviving stone loggia a telltale sign as to its former existence. The museum itself comprises some of the modest Cook-related collections outside of the ownership of the major national and international collections; including household items and a speculative reconstruction of the birthplace cottage that was swept away amid the landscaping process for the Marton Lodge, home to the Rudd family, which stood here until 1793. Also on call to the visitor are a series of interactive displays and temporary travelling exhibitions as well as a cafe, gift shop, education suite and resources and archive room.

When the estate was planned in the 1940s it was originally known as the 'Cookridge Tower Estate'. The estate predated surrounding estates such as Ireland Wood and Moor Grange. Holt Park came many years later and provided many facilities such as an Asda supermarket, shopping centre, leisure centre and secondary school. The area was mainly made up of council-owned social housing although a growing number of these houses are now privately owned. It is near to the Tinshill BT Tower also known as the Cookridge Tower, one of the highest points in the city. Horsforth railway station is closer to Tinshill than Horsforth; the station is on the Cookridge side of the Moseley beck.

The event is the most popular marathon in the Netherlands, followed by the marathons of Amsterdam and Eindhoven. History The Rotterdam Marathon often produces very fast times, as the course is flat and weather conditions are typically favorable. Between April 1985 and September 1998 the world best time had been set at Rotterdam, by Carlos Lopes and Belayneh Dinsamo respectively. As of April 2012 six different runners ran a sub 2:05:00 time and four of the ten fastest marathon runners ever ran their fastest time in the Rotterdam Marathon. The 2007 event was stopped after the three and a half hours because of extreme weather conditions; the KNMI meteorological institute described conditions as \\"unseasonal\\" and race day was the warmest ever recorded in the city for the month of April, with temperatures reaching a high of 34 °C.

Influenced by Postcard- label bands such as Josef K and punk-era bands such as Buzzcocks, The Desperate Bicycles and The Television Personalities, their mix of guitar pop with viola and trumpet formed a blueprint for many of the indie pop bands that would follow. History After forming in June 1983, they first played live as a band in August that year, soon attracting the attention of future Creation Records boss Alan McGee who gave them several gigs at the now famous 'Living Room', but reputedly decided not to sign The June Brides to his new label as it would have been \\"too obvious\\".Taylor, Neil (1985) \\"...and the brides wore pink\\", NME, 2 February 1985, p. 20 Two Joe Foster-produced 1984 singles on The Pink Label, \\"In The Rain\\" and \\"Every Conversation\\" saw The June Brides receive much attention and these two songs appeared frequently on compilation albums from that era. A year later, the mini-album There Are Eight Million Stories... appeared (produced by John O'Neill of That Petrol Emotion) and went straight to number one in the UK Indie Chart, staying there for a month. The album remained in the indie chart for 38 weeks. Disillusioned with Pink, the band moved to Marc Riley's In-Tape label for two further singles - \\"No Place Like Home\\" and \\"This Town\\" and in 1986 opened for The Smiths on their Irish tour dates. The June Brides were asked to contribute to the NME's C86 compilation but declined for fear of being pigeonholed. After losing confidence in In-Tape, they approached Go! Discs, who had offered them a deal the previous year, but with the band falling out of favour with critics and some of their early fans, Go! Discs were no longer interested. The band split in 1986, with singer Wilson embarking on a solo career on Creation Records.Strong, Martin C.

He began and ended his career at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires where he sang regularly from 1958 through 1998. He first drew international attention in 1964 when he sang the title role in the world premiere of Alberto Ginastera's Don Rodrigo, which led to a series of appearances at the Royal Opera, London during the 1960s. In the 1970s his international career skyrocketed with appearances at most of the major opera houses in Europe and the United States. He remained active on the international stage during the 1980s but his career slowed down significantly in the 1990s after he contracted liver cancer. Cossutta had a powerful voice, buttressed by a solid technique that provided exceptional stamina. He excelled in the dramatic and spinto tenor repertoire, and was particularly successful in the operas of Giuseppe Verdi. He was especially renowned for his performances of the title role in Verdi's Otello and the role of Pollione in Bellini's Norma. Although his performance credits place him among the leading tenors of his generation, he never quite reached the star status of his early contemporaries such as Franco Corelli and Mario del Monaco, or later ones like Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti. Biography Early life and career Born in Santa Croce del Carso (Križ) near Trieste, Italy, in Slovene family Cossutta emigrated to Argentina where he initially worked as a furniture carpenter. After discovering his vocal capabilities he studied singing under Manfredo Miselli, Mario Melani, and Arturo Wolken in Buenos Aires. He made his professional opera debut in 1956 at a small Argentine theatre as Alfredo in Verdi's La traviata. His first performance of note came two years later when he appeared for the first time at the Teatro Colón as Cassio in Verdi's Otello in 1958. He sang regularly at that house for the next four decades, initially in mainly supporting roles. Notable early appearances at the Teatro Colón include Edgardo in Lucia di Lammermoor (1959), Mario Cavaradossi in Tosca (1962), and Rodolfo in La bohème (1963). Rise to international success The year 1964 proved to be a milestone in Cossutta's career. It marked the beginning of his reigning years at the Teatro Colón where he portrayed four roles in 1964: the title role in the world premiere of Alberto Ginastera's Don Rodrigo, Gabriele Adorno in Verdi's Simon Boccanegra, Kalaf in Ferruccio Busoni's Turandot, and the title role in \\"Oedipus Rex\\" (Stravinsky). That same year he launched his international opera career, making his European debut in London with the Royal Opera, Covent Garden as the Duke of Mantua in a lauded production of Verdi's Rigoletto. From 1965 to 1970 Cossutta was the Teatro Colón's principal dramatic tenor, singing such diverse roles as Alfredo, Enzo Grimaldo in Ponchielli's La Gioconda, Jason in Luigi Cherubini's Médée, Ottone in Claudio Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea, Pinkerton in Puccini's Madama Butterfly, Riccardo in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera, and Uldino in Verdi's Attila among others. During this time his international career continued. He made his American debut with the Lyric Opera of Chicago on October 4, 1963 in the role of Abdallo in Verdi's Nabucco and in that season also sang Cassio in Otello and Walter in Tannhauser. He returned to Chicago in 1966 as Dimitri in Boris Godunov, Don Carlo in 1971, Gabriele Adorno in Simon Boccanegra in 1974, Otello in 1975, Dick Johnson in La Fanciulla del West in 1978 and Samson in 1981. He returned to Covent Garden in 1965 to sing Turiddu in Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana and again in 1968 to portray the title hero in Verdi's Don Carlos. His debut at Vienna State Opera came in 1966 as Cavaradossi in Puccini's Tosca, and over the next 25 years he continued to appear there in more than 130 performances, including even the role of Froh in Richard Wagner's Rheingold. In 1970 he appeared as the tenor soloist in a production of Verdi's Requiem with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. After 1970 Cossutta's international career blossomed. He continued to appear at the Teatro Colón regularly through 1998 but with less frequency than in the 1960s as his international career became more important. On January 6, 1971 he made his debut at the Deutsche Oper Berlin singing Alfredo to Beverly Sills's Violetta. In the 1971-1972 season, Cossutta made his debuts at La Scala, the Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi, the Festival dei Due Mondi, and the Opéra National de Paris. On September 23, 1972 he made his first appearance at the San Francisco Opera singing Radames in Verdi's Aida. On February 17, 1973 Cossutta made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City singing Pollione in Bellini's Norma with Montserrat Caballé in the title part, Fiorenza Cossotto as Adalgisa, Giorgio Tozzi as Oroveso, Charles Anthony as Flavio, and conductor Carlo Felice Cillario. In the August 1973 he made his first appearance at the Arena di Verona Festival, returning there again in the summer of 1974. He sang the title role in Verdi's Otello for the first time at Covent Garden in 1974, a role which became one of his signature parts during the next decade. He also made his Moscow debut that year as Radames during a European tour with La Scala. In 1975 Cossutta sang Manrico in Verdi's Il trovatore at the Palais Garnier, returning there in 1979 to sing Ismaele in Verdi's Nabucco, both with Viorica Cortez. In 1977, Cossutta took part in a highly lauded complete recording of Otello with Margaret Price as Desdemona, Gabriel Bacquier as Iago, and Sir Georg Solti conducting the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. That same year he made the first of many appearances at the Hamburg State Opera where he was a regular guest through the end of his career. In 1978 Cossutta substituted for the younger tenor Plácido Domingo in a San Francisco Opera performance of Otello; Domingo returned the favor some years later in 1983. In 1979 Cossutta returned to the Met to sing Pollione again, this time to Shirley Verrett's Norma. Later life and career During the 1980s and 1990s Cossutta continued to appear in operas around the world, although his career slowed down considerably as he began to battle liver cancer. He had a number of successes with the role of Samson in Camille Saint-Saëns's Samson et Dalila which he first performed at the Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi in 1982. He notably recorded the role live at the Bregenz Festival in 1988. His last performance of the part was in Hamburg in 1996. Other notable appearances during these years included a 1986 performance of Don Alvaro in La forza del destino at the San Francisco Opera and 1991 performances of Manrico at the Opéra Bastille and the Hamburg State Opera. He also sang the roles of Samson and Canio at the Vienna State Opera in 1991. Cossutta retired from the opera stage in 1998 after making his final appearance at the Teatro Colón as Macduff in Verdi's Macbeth. He died in Udine.

Early years and background Evatt was born in 1933, the daughter of the barrister Clive Evatt , granddaughter of Harry Andreas of Leuralla, and the niece of H. V. Evatt. Educated at the Presbyterian Ladies' College in Pymble, Sydney, Evatt studied law at the University of Sydney, as the youngest law student ever accepted, and became the first female student to win the University's Medal for Law, graduating in March 1955. Admitted as at barrister in New South Wales in 1955, Evatt won a scholarship to Harvard University where she was awarded a LLM in 1956 and was admitted to the bar at the Inner Temple in London, United Kingdom. From 1968 to 1973, Evatt worked at the England and Wales Law Commission under Lord Scarman. Judicial appointments Australia In December 1972, Evatt was appointed as the first female Deputy President of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and retained this position until 1989. Between 1974 and 1977, Evatt chaired the Royal Commission on Human Relationships, producing recommendations which ultimately led to the enactment of the Family Law Act 1975 where no-fault divorce and the single ground of irreconcilable differences evidenced by twelve months separation were introduced into Australian family law. The Act also established the Family Court of Australia, and Evatt was appointed as its inaugural Chief Justice holding this position from 1976 until 1988. In 1988 Evatt was appointed President of the Australian Law Reform Commission, a position she held until 1993. From 1995 to 1998, she served as a part-time Commissioner of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. International Appointed as a member of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 1984, Evatt later chaired the Committee, from 1989 to 1991, and remained a member until 1992. Evatt was the first Australian to be elected to the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 1992, serving as a member from 1993 to 2000. Between 1998 and 2007, Evatt served two consecutive, five-year terms as a judge of a tribunal of the World Bank that determines staffing disputes. Evatt was elected as a Commissioner of the International Committee of Jurists in April 2003. Non- judicial appointments In 1988 Evatt was made Chancellor of the University of Newcastle, holding this post until 1994. In 1995 Evatt was commissioned by Senator Herron, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, to review the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. Her extensive report, Review of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 ('the Evatt Review') was presented in August 1996 and paved the way for legislative reform to a complex and controversial area of law. Human rights advocate Evatt has been an outspoken advocate of issues relating to human rights in Australia, particularly women's rights. In a 2004 speech to mark the twentieth anniversary of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, Evatt critiqued the Act and other laws relating to women's rights in Australia, in terms of its inadequacies in satisfying Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. She was also critical of the then Howard Liberal government's anti-terrorism legislation, particularly provisions relating to control orders and preventive detention, saying that \\"These laws are striking at the most fundamental freedoms in our democracy in a most draconian way.\\" Evatt was a signatory to the Yogyakarta Principles in November 2006. Awards and honours Evatt was made an Officer of the Order of Australia on 14 June 1982, in recognition of services to the law, and was granted the status of Companion of the Order of Australia, at the Queen's Birthday honours on 12 June 1995. The latter citation was awarded \\"in recognition of service to the law, social justice and to the promotion of human rights worldwide, particularly in the areas of equal opportunity and anti-discrimination legislation and practice\\". In 1985 an honorary degree of LL.D was conferred on Evatt by the University of Sydney at a special ceremony which celebrated the centenary of the first graduations by women at the university. In 1994, the Flinders University of South Australia conferred the same award on Evatt. In 2007 the Blue Mountains Community Legal Centre changed its name to the Elizabeth Evatt Community Legal Centre. The Centre provides free legal advice to clients in the surrounding region, and Evatt serves as patron of the Centre. Evatt is a Life Member of the Evatt Foundation, an organisation established as a memorial to her uncle, Dr H. V. Evatt, with the aim of advancing the highest ideals of the labour movement, such as equality, participation, social justice and human rights. Evatt served as Vice-President of the Foundation between 1982 and 1987. She was added to the Victorian Honour Roll of Women in 2001.

It incorporates a broad range of activities, including product modification, changes to the production process, sustainable packaging, as well as modifying advertising. Yet defining green marketing is not a simple task where several meanings intersect and contradict each other; an example of this will be the existence of varying social, environmental and retail definitions attached to this term. Other similar terms used are environmental marketing and ecological marketing. Green, environmental and eco-marketing are part of the new marketing approaches which do not just refocus, adjust or enhance existing marketing thinking and practice, but seek to challenge those approaches and provide a substantially different perspective. In more detail green, environmental and eco-marketing belong to the group of approaches which seek to address the lack of fit between marketing as it is currently practiced and the ecological and social realities of the wider marketing environment. The legal implications of marketing claims call for caution or overstated claims can lead to regulatory or civil challenges. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission provides some guidance on environmental marketing claims. The commission is expected to do an overall review of this guidance, and the legal standards it contains, in 2011. History The term Green Marketing came into prominence in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The proceedings of this workshop resulted in one of the first books on green marketing entitled \\"Ecological Marketing\\". The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Reports started with the ice cream seller Ben & Jerry's where the financial report was supplemented by a greater view on the company's environmental impact. In 1987 a document prepared by the World Commission on Environment and Development defined sustainable development as meeting “the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own need”, this became known as the Brundtland Report and was another step towards widespread thinking on sustainability in everyday activity. Two tangible milestones for the first wave of green marketing came in the form of published books: Green Marketing by Ken Peattie (1992) in the United Kingdom and Green Marketing: Challenges & Opportunities for the New Marketing Age by Jacquelyn Ottman (1993) in the United States of America. According to Jacquelyn Ottman, (author of \\"The New Rules of Green Marketing: Strategies, Tools, and Inspiration for Sustainable Branding\\" (Greenleaf Publishing and Berrett-Koehler Publishers, February 2011)) from an organizational standpoint, environmental considerations should be integrated into all aspects of marketing — new product development and communications and all points in between. The holistic nature of green also suggests that besides suppliers and retailers new stakeholders be enlisted, including educators, members of the community, regulators, and NGOs. Environmental issues should be balanced with primary customer needs. The \\"Green consumerism\\" movements in the U.S. and other countries have struggled to reach critical mass and influence. However, public opinion polls taken since the late 1980s have shown consistently that a significant percentage of consumers in the U.S. and elsewhere profess a strong willingness to favor environmentally conscious products and companies. One of green marketing's challenges is the lack of standards or public consensus about what constitutes \\"green,\\" according to Joel Makower, a writer on green marketing. This lack of consensus—by consumers, marketers, activists, regulators, and influential people—has slowed the growth of green products, says Makower, because companies are often reluctant to promote their green attributes, and consumers are often skeptical about claims. Despite these challenges, green marketing has continued to gain adherents, particularly in light of growing global concern about climate change. This concern has led more companies to advertise their commitment to reduce their climate impacts, and the effect this is having on their products and services. Greenhouse gas reduction market The emerging greenhouse gas reduction market can potentially catalyze projects with important local environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits. The Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), for example, enables trading between industrial and developing nations, providing a framework that can result in capital flows to environmentally beneficial development activities. Although the United States is not participating in the Kyoto Protocol, several US programs enable similar transactions on a voluntary and regulatory basis. While international trade in greenhouse gas reductions holds substantial promise as a source of new funding for sustainable development, this market can be largely inaccessible to many smaller-scale projects, remote communities, and least developed localities. To facilitate participation and broaden the benefits, several barriers must be overcome, including: a lack of market awareness among stakeholders and prospective participants; specialized, somewhat complicated participation rules; and the need for simplified participation mechanisms for small projects, without which transaction costs can overwhelm the financial benefits of participation. If the barriers are adequately addressed, greenhouse gas trading can play an important role supporting activities that benefit people’s lives and the environment. Popularity and effectiveness Ongoing debate The popularity of such marketing approach and its effectiveness is hotly debated. Supporters claim that environmental appeals are actually growing in number–the Energy Star label, for example, now appears on 11,000 different companies' models in 38 product categories, from washing machines and light bulbs to skyscrapers and homes. However, despite the growth in the number of green products, green marketing is on the decline as the primary sales pitch for products. Shel Horowitz, a green marketer for over 30 years and primary author of Guerrilla marketing Goes Green states that to market effectively, green businesses need to market to three different audiences, \\"deep green,\\" \\"lazy green,\\" and \\"nongreen\\", and that each must be approached differently. Each will have different trigger points that will move them to buy, and for the nongreen audience, marketing effectively usually requires emphasizing product superiority rather than care for the planet. On the other hand, Roper’s Green Gauge shows that a high percentage of consumers (42%) feel that environmental products don’t work as well as conventional ones. This is an unfortunate legacy from the 1970s when shower heads sputtered and natural detergents left clothes dingy. Given the choice, all but the greenest of customers will reach for synthetic detergents over the premium-priced, proverbial \\"Happy Planet\\" any day, including Earth Day. New reports, however show a growing trend towards green products. The demand for green-oriented products has been a boom to the firms that supply them. New markets emerge for recycled building products, packaging, paper goods, and even sweaters and sneakers, as well as, more efficient appliances lighting, heating, and cooling systems in homes and offices. Some green options are more expensive than traditional products and initiatives. This could learn to exploitation which is common enough that it even had produced the term greenwashing. Consumers need to question whether a firm is spending significantly more money and time advertising being green and operating with consideration for the environment than actually spending these resources on environmentally sound practices. Confusion One challenge green marketers old and new are likely to face as green products and messages become more common is confusion in the marketplace. \\"Consumers do not really understand a lot about these issues, and there's a lot of confusion out there,\\" says Jacquelyn Ottman (founder of J. Ottman Consulting and author of \\"Green Marketing: Opportunity for Innovation.\\") Marketers sometimes take advantage of this confusion, and purposely make false or exaggerated \\"green\\" claims. Critics refer to this practice as \\"green washing\\". =Greenwashing= Corporations are increasingly recognizing the benefits of green marketing, although there is often a thin line between doing so for its own benefit and for social responsibility reasons. The term “greenwashing” refers to all industries that adopt outwardly green acts with an underlying purpose to increase profits. The primary objective of greenwashing is to provide consumers with the feeling that the organization is taking the necessary steps to responsibly manage its ecological footprint. In reality, the company may be doing very little that is environmentally beneficialOrange, E. (2010): From eco-friendly to eco-intelligent. THE FUTURIST, September–October 2010, 28-32. The term greenwashing was first used by environmentalist Jay Westerveld when objecting to hotelier's practice of placing notices in hotel rooms which asked their guests to reuse towels to “save the environment”. Westerveld noted that there was little else to suggest that the hoteliers were interested in reducing their environmental impacts, and that their interest in washing fewer towels seemed to be motivated by a concern to save costs rather than the environment. Since then greenwashing has become a central feature of debates about marketing communications and sustainability, with “awards” for greenwashing established and numerous campaigns, law and advice developed in an attempt to reduce or curb it.Belz F., Peattie K.(2009): Sustainability Marketing: A Global Perspective. John Wiley & Sons Benefit corporations In January 2012, Patagonia became the first brand to register for benefit corporation status. A benefit corporation is an alternative to its standard counterpart as it operates under the legal premise of 1) creating a positive impact socially and environmentally in its materials, 2) uphold corporate social responsibility in terms of considering its workers, its community, and the environment as well as challenge its current boundaries in those areas, and 3) report its activity as a company as well as its achievements in social and environmental areas publicly using a non-partisan third party source. Statistics According to market researcher Mintel, about 12% of the U.S. population can be identified as True Greens, consumers who seek out and regularly buy so-called green products. Another 68%Greenfield Online/Mintel can be classified as Light Greens, consumers who buy green sometimes. \\"What chief marketing officers are always looking for is touch points with consumers, and this is just a big, big, big touch point that's not being served,\\" says Mintel Research Director David Lockwood. \\"All the corporate executives that we talk to are extremely convinced that being able to make some sort of strong case about the environment is going to work down to their bottom line.\\"  Adoptability  In 1989, 67 percent of Americans stated that they were willing to pay 5-10 percent more for ecologically compatible products.Coddington, W. (1990): It's no fad: environmentalism is now a fact of corporate life. Marketing News, 15 October, 7. By 1991, environmentally conscious individuals were willing to pay between 15-20 percent more for green products.Suchard, H.T. and Polonski, M.J. (1991): A theory of environmental buyer behavior and its validity: the environmental action-behaviour model. in Gilly, M.C. et al. (Eds), AMA Summer Educators´ Conference Proceedings, American Marketing Association, Chicago, IL, 2, 187-201. Today, more than one-third of Americans say they would pay a little extra for green products An important challenge facing marketers is to identify which consumers are willing to pay more for environmentally friendly products. It is apparent that an enhanced knowledge of the profile of this segment of consumers would be extremely useful. Everett Rogers, communication scholar and author of “Diffusion of Innovations”, claims that the following five factors can help determine whether a new idea will be adopted or not, including the idealism of the shift towards “green”: # Relative advantage: is the degree to which the new behavior is believed to accrue more beneficial outcomes than current practice. # Observability: is how easy it is to witness the outcomes of the new behavior. # Trialability: is the ease with which the new behavior can be tested by an individual without making a full commitment. # Compatibility: is the degree to which the new behavior is consistent with current practice. # Complexity: is how difficult the new behavior is to implement. LOHAS LOHAS stands for Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability, and describes an integrated, rapidly growing market for goods and services that appeal to consumers whose sense of environmental and social responsibility influences their purchase decisions. The Natural Marketing Institute's (short: NMI) estimates the US LOHAS consumer market of products and services to be US$209 billion – sold across all consumer segments.Todd, kaiser: Eco-marketing: a blooming corporate strategy, 2008. The five LOHAS segments as defined by NMI include: * LOHAS: Active environmental stewards dedicated to personal and planetary health. These are the heaviest purchasers of green and socially responsible products and the early adopters who influence others heavily. * Naturalites: Motivated primarily by personal health considerations. They tend to purchase more LOHAS consumable products vs. durable items. * Drifters: While their intentions may be good, DRIFTERS follow trends when it is easy and affordable. They are currently quite engaged in green purchasing behaviours. * Conventionals: Pragmatists who embrace LOHAS behaviour when they believe they can make a difference, but are primarily focused on being very careful with their resources and doing the ‘right’ thing because it will save them money. * Unconcerned: Either unaware or unconcerned about the environment and societal issues mainly because they do not have the time or the means – these consumers are largely focused on getting by. The distribution of the different types of LOHAS.  The green marketing mix  A model green marketing mix contains four \\"P's\\": * Product: A producer should offer ecological products which not only must not contaminate the environment but should protect it and even liquidate existing environmental damages. * Price: Prices for such products may be a little higher than conventional alternatives. But target groups like for example LOHAS are willing to pay extra for green products. * Place: A distribution logistics is of crucial importance; main focus is on ecological packaging. Marketing local and seasonal products e.g. vegetables from regional farms is more easy to be marketed “green” than products imported. * Promotion: A communication with the market should put stress on environmental aspects, for example that the company possesses a CP certificate or is ISO 14000 certified. This may be publicized to improve a firm's image. Furthermore, the fact that a company spends expenditures on environmental protection should be advertised. Third, sponsoring the natural environment is also very important. And last but not least, ecological products will probably require special sales promotions. Additional social marketing \\"P's\\" that are used in this process are: * Publics: Effective Social Marketing knows its audience, and can appeal to multiple groups of people. \\"Public\\" is the external and internal groups involved in the program. External publics include the target audience, secondary audiences, policymakers, and gatekeepers, while the internal publics are those who are involved in some way with either approval or implementation of the program. * Partnership: Most social change issues, including \\"green\\" initiatives, are too complex for one person or group to handle. Associating with other groups and initiatives to team up strengthens the chance of efficacy. * Policy: Social marketing programs can do well in motivating individual behavior change, but that is difficult to sustain unless the environment they're in supports that change for the long run. Often, policy change is needed, and media advocacy programs can be an effective complement to a social marketing program. * Purse Strings: How much will this strategic effort cost? Who is funding the effort? The level of greening—strategic, quasi-strategic, or tactical—dictates what activities should be undertaken by a company. Strategic greening in one area may or may not be leveraged effectively in others. A firm could make substantial changes in production processes but opt not to leverage them by positioning itself as an environmental leader. So although strategic greening is not necessarily strategically integrated into all marketing activities, it is nevertheless strategic in the product area.Grundey, D. and Zaharia, R.M. (2008): Sustainable incentives in marketing and strategic greening: the cases of Lithuania and Romania. Baltic Journal on Sustainability, 14(2), 130 –143. Green marketing activities  Ecolabels  An individual's belief that an environmental claim lacks honesty can have a negative effect on attitude toward a brand. If, on the other side, the consumer grants credibility to the claim, the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment. The problem in extending that credibility to a brand is that consumers interested in ecological products generally are skeptical of commercial advertisements. This skepticism is due to various factors such as lack of language, the absence of scientific knowledge necessary to interpret advertising meaning, and, in particular, the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques. To resolve this problem, independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on the environmental benefits of brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations. This practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the information with the aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of environmental benefits of products—all of which should positively affect the purchase intention.Montoro- Rios, F.J., Luque-Martinez, T. and Rodriguez-Molina, M.-A. (2008): How Green Should You Be: Can Environmental Associations Enhance Brand Performance?. Journal of advertising research, December 2008, 547-563. Overview of the different types of ecolabels used to indicate credibility to consumer.Horne, R.E. (2009): Limits to labels: The role of eco-labels in the assessment of product sustainability and routes to sustainable consumption. International Journal of Consumer Studies, 33, 175–182.  Life-cycle assessment  During the late 1980s, new instruments such as life-cycle assessment (LCA) were invented which allowed ecological considerations to be introduced into marketing decisions. The life cycle assessment model seeks to identify the main types of environmental impact throughout the life cycle of a product. LCA was developed according to ISO 14040. The main goal of the LCA is to define the energy and environmental profile of the finished products. The reasons to use LCA arose from the need to have a precise process accounting and to highlight potential improvements that could be used in order to increase the environmental, energy and economic efficiency and overall effectiveness of the processes. In addition, the purpose was to quantify the environmental advantages deriving from the use of recycled raw material.Intini, F. and Kühtz, S. (2010): Recycling in buildings: an LCA case study of a thermal insulation panel made of polyester fiber, recycled from post-consumer PET bottles. International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 16, 306–315. Example for LCA LCA is used for example in the building sector. Buildings today account for the 40% of the world's energy use. The resulting carbon emissions are substantially higher than those of the transportation sector. New buildings using more energy than necessary are being built every day, and millions of today's inefficient buildings will remain standing until at least 2050. It's therefore necessary to start reducing energy use in new and existing buildings in order to reduce the planet's energy-related carbon footprint. Growing interest, space, and attention in the architecture sector are directed to environmental issues according to the principles of green building. Mineral, vegetable, or animal materials such as perlite, vermiculite, rock wool, glass wool, cork, plant fibers (cotton, flax, hemp, coconut), wood fiber, cellulose, and sheep's wool can be used for the production of insulation panels. Cases Phillips's \\"Marathon\\" CFL lightbulb Philips Lighting's first shot at marketing a standalone compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulb was Earth Light, at $15 each versus 75 cents for incandescent bulbs. The product had difficulty climbing out of its deep green niche. The company re-launched the product as \\"Marathon,\\" underscoring its new \\"super long life\\" positioning and promise of saving $26 in energy costs over its five-year lifetime. Finally, with the U.S. EPA's Energy Star label to add credibility as well as new sensitivity to rising utility costs and electricity shortages, sales climbed 12 percent in an otherwise flat market. Car sharing services Car-sharing services address the longer-term solutions to consumer needs for better fuel savings and fewer traffic tie-ups and parking nightmares, to complement the environmental benefit of more open space and reduction of greenhouse gases. They may be thought of as a \\"time-sharing\\" system for cars. Consumers who drive less than 7,500 miles a year and do not need a car for work can save thousands of dollars annually by joining one of the many services springing up, including Zipcar (East Coast), I-GO Car (Chicago),I-GO Car Sharing Business Profile and Hour Car (Twin Cities). Electronics sector The consumer electronics sector provides room for using green marketing to attract new customers. One example of this is HP's promise to cut its global energy use 20 percent by the year 2010. To accomplish this reduction below 2005 levels, The Hewlett-Packard Company announced plans to deliver energy-efficient products and services and institute energy-efficient operating practices in its facilities worldwide. Products and services Now companies are offering more eco-friendly alternatives for their customers. Recycled products for example, are one of the most popular alternatives that can benefit the environment. These benefits include sustainable forestry, clean air, energy efficiency, water conservation, and a healthy office. One example, is the E-commerce business and office supply company Shoplet which offers a web tool that allows you to replace similar items in your shopping cart with greener products.

The business began in Sheffield in 1828 as a steel foundry and became known for its church bells, going on to make shafts and propellors for ships, armour plate and then artillery. Entire large ships, cars, tanks and torpedoes followed. Airships and aircraft were added, and Vickers jet airliners were to remain in production until 1965. Financial problems following the death of the Vickers brothers were resolved in 1927 by separating out Metropolitan Carriage Wagon and Finance Company and Metropolitan-Vickers, then merging the remaining bulk of the original business with Armstrong Whitworth to form Vickers-Armstrongs. The Vickers name resurfaced as Vickers plc between 1977 and 1999. History Foundry { Colonel Thomas Vickers (1833–1915) Albert Vickers (1838–1919) Vickers was formed in Sheffield as a steel foundry by the miller Edward Vickers and his father-in-law George Naylor in 1828. Naylor was a partner in the foundry Naylor & Sanderson, and Vickers' brother William owned a steel rolling operation. Edward's investments in the railway industry allowed him to gain control of the company, based at Millsands near Sheffield, and known as Naylor Vickers and Company. It began life making steel castings and quickly became famous for casting church bells. In 1854 Vickers' sons Thomas and Albert joined the business. In 1863 the company moved to a new site in Sheffield on the River Don in Brightside. The company went public in 1867 as Vickers, Sons & Company and gradually acquired more businesses, branching out into various sectors. } Special steels and armaments In 1868 Vickers began to manufacture marine shafts, in 1872 they began casting marine propellers and in 1882 they set up a forging press. Vickers produced their first armour plate in 1888 and their first artillery piece in 1890. Ships Sir Hiram Maxim (1840–1916) caricature by Spy for Vanity Fair, 1904 It bought out the Barrow in Furness shipbuilder The Barrow Shipbuilding Company in 1897, acquiring its subsidiary the Maxim Nordenfelt Guns And Ammunitions Company at the same time, to become Vickers, Sons & Maxim. The yard at Barrow became the \\"Naval Construction Yard\\". With these acquisitions, Vickers could now produce a complete selection of products, from ships and marine fittings to armour plate and a suite of ordnance. In 1901 the Royal Navy's first submarine, Holland 1, was launched at the Naval Construction Yard. In 1902 Vickers took a half share in the famous Clyde shipyard John Brown and Company. Cars Further diversification occurred in 1901 with the purchase of Herbert Austin's embryonic car manufacturing plans, and Austin himself, from The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company. The new business was incorporated and named The Wolseley Tool and Motor Car Company and works were purchased at Adderley Park, Birmingham. Torpedoes In 1911 a controlling interest was acquired in Whitehead and Company, a torpedo manufacturer based in Fiume, Croatia and at Portland Harbour, Dorset. Aircraft In 1911, the company name was changed to Vickers Limited and expanded its operations into aircraft manufacture by the formation of Vickers Ltd (Aviation Department). Vickers brand aircraft were produced from 1911 to 1965, when BAC ended use of the name. Electrical engineering In 1919, the British Westinghouse electrical company was taken over as the Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company; Metrovick. At the same time they came into Metropolitan's railway interests. Wolseley, now Wolseley Motors, was sold to William Morris in mid-November 1926 and he retained it as his personal property. Reorganization and financial reconstruction At the sixtieth Annual General Meeting on 29 April 1927 at the River Don Works, Sheffield, the chairman, General Herbert Lawrence, reported that the ordinary dividend would be passed because of the Coal Strike. His review gave the activities of the main groups of operations divided under five main heads: * Armaments and shipbuilding * Heavy engineering – these two activities were carried on mainly at works in Sheffield, Barrow, Erith, Dartford and Weybridge * Rolling-stock – Metropolitan Carriage Wagon and Finance Company * Electrical – Metropolitan-Vickers * Miscellaneous – they had disposed of Docker Brothers Limited. He had reported in the year before that an internal reorganization was in progress to deal with those subsidiary branches which proved a heavy drain on financial resources.Vickers, Limited. The Times, Saturday, 30 April 1927; p. 19; Issue 44569 This internal review led to the retention of the rolling stock group (Metropolitan Carriage Wagon and Finance Company and The Metropolitan-Vickers Company) and the disposal of: * Vickers-Petters Limited * British Lighting and Ignition Company (manufacture of BLIC magnetos) – shut down * the plywood department at Crayford Creek * Canadian Vickers * William Beardmore and Company * Wolseley Motors (losses since the Armistice were in excess of £1.25 million and, unable to pay creditors, the company was being compulsorily wound up by the court)City Notes The Times, Saturday, 30 April 1927; p. 18; Issue 44569. Subsequently, Vickers carried through a financial reconstruction scheme which after making additional reserves for contingent liabilities reduced their assets by £12.5 million and their total balance sheet from £34.7 to £22.2 million.City Notes. Armstrong-Vickers Fusion. The Times, Friday, 4 November 1927; p. 21; Issue 44730 Merger with Armstrong Whitworth In 1927, Vickers agreed to merge their armaments and shipbuilding and heavy engineering activities with the Tyneside based engineering company Armstrong Whitworth, founded by W. G. Armstrong, to form Vickers-Armstrongs Limited. This merger was to take effect on 1 January 1928 and would give Vickers shareholders ownership of two-thirds of the new company. Metropolitan Carriage Wagon and Finance Company and The Metropolitan-Vickers Company were not included in the merger.City Notes. Armstrong-Vickers Fusion. The Times, Saturday, 19 November 1927; p. 20; Issue 44743 Businesses Armaments Vickers manufactured and sold the Maxim machine gun, forming a partnership with its inventor. They later took over the company and improved the design as the Vickers machine gun, which was the last major design Hiram Maxim himself worked on. It became the standard machine gun of the British Empire and Commonwealth, serving for some 50 years in the British Army. Vickers produced the machine gun in dozens of cartridge sizes and sold it all over the world. They also scaled it up to larger calibres, particularly for the Royal Navy as a 0.5 inch model. 75mm mountain gun (1900) Vickers & Maxim also introduced one of the first cannons to have an hydraulic recoil absorbing mechanism: in 1900 they produced a small 75 mm cannon that used two cylinders mounted alongside the barrel. Vickers was involved in the production of numerous firearms. The British tested John Pedersen's design for a semi-automatic rifle between World War I and World War II. Vickers made a British version of the rifle, and their version of the Pedersen rifle usually goes by the name \\"Vickers Pedersen Rifle\\". The company was also involved in the manufacture of 6,000–10,000 (6181 is often quoted) Luger pistols in 1922–24. These 1906 pattern pistols were in 9 mm calibre and part of a contract for the Dutch military. The Lugers are identifiable by the inscription \\"Vickers Ltd\\" on the forward toggle link. In the interwar period Vickers worked on several tank designs. Medium Mark I and Mark II were adopted by the British Army. The Vickers 6-Ton tank was the most successful, being exported or built by other nations under licence. The Vickers A1E1 Independent tank design was never put into production but credited with influencing other nations. During the Second World War, Vickers built large guns and tanks; the Valentine tank was a design that they had developed privately. Airships Vickers began work on Britain's first rigid airship (for the Admiralty) in mid-1909 in Cavendish Dock, Cumbria. Through a lack of experience HMA No. 1, then the largest airship, broke up on its second trip out of a floating hangar on the evening of 23 September 1911. Further designs and difficulties followed, although non- rigid machines including \\"Sea Scouts\\" (popularly called blimps) proved generally less troublesome than the larger rigid examples. For their second attempt at rigid airships, a team was formed with H B Pratt as \\"Chief Draughtsmen, Airships\\". Pratt had left Vickers in 1912 to work for J. Samuel White at Cowes. When he was persuaded to return to Vickers, he brought with him a colleague, Barnes Wallis, to be his assistant.Pugh Barnes Wallis dambuster p7 The pair worked incognito from London where they were supplied with the latest intelligence on German rigid airships, such as the LZ.216, and information freely provided by the German manufacturers of non-rigid airships. Some models featured floating cars slung beneath them. Much experience in mooring techniques and swivelling motors was gathered despite the pressures of wartime. The last airship built at the Walney Island hangar was a small non- rigid reconnaissance machine for the Japanese government that first flew on 27 April 1921. A subsidiary called the Airship Guarantee Company Limited was formed under Sir Dennis Burney from 29 November 1923 (lasting until 30 November 1935) specifically to participate in the building of a massive six- engined experimental airship, the R100, in competition with the government- built R101 as part of the Imperial Airship Scheme. Their buildings were at Howden in Yorkshire. Barnes Wallis and Nevil Shute Norway were on the design team. The R100 first flew on 16 December 1929 and achieved some trans-Atlantic flights before the airship scheme was stopped following the disastrous crash of the R101 in France. The R100 was scrapped in November 1931 by Elton, Levy and Company. *HMA No. 1 * No. 9r * 23 class airship ** No. 23r ** R26 * SS class blimp * R80 * R100 Aircraft Vickers formed Vickers Ltd (Aviation Department) 1911 and produced one of the first aircraft designed to carry a machine gun, the FB5 (fighting biplane) Gun Bus. During World War I it produced the Vimy heavy bomber. An example of the latter became the first aircraft to cross the Atlantic Ocean non-stop, a converted Royal Air Force bomber (see 1919 in aviation.) The Vimy was later developed into the Virginia, a mainstay in the RAF during the interwar years. Vickers was a pioneer in producing airliners, early examples being converted from Vimy bombers. Vickers brand aircraft were produced from 1911 to 1965, when BAC ended the name. Like many other British manufacturers, an enterprise in Canada was set up; Canadian Vickers Limited. This company ceased operations in 1944. Canadair was founded shortly after by former Canadian Vickers employees and later absorbed into Bombardier Aerospace. Shipbuilding Vickers entered naval shipbuilding with the purchase of Barrow Shipbuilding Company in 1897, forming the Naval Construction Yard at Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria. This yard later passed into the hands of the nationalised British Shipbuilders in 1977, was privatised as Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd in 1986 and remains in operation to this day as BAE Systems Submarine Solutions.

Life and work Palucca was born in Munich. Shortly after birth, her family moved to San Francisco, returning with her mother to Dresden in 1909. From 1917 to 1918, she attended Margarete Balsat's school for upper-class girls in Dresden and ballet lessons with Heinrich Kröller from 1914 to 1916. From 1921, when she changed her name to Gret Palucca, until 1923, she studied with Mary Wigman and performed as member of her Chamber Dance Group. In 1924, she married Friedrich Bienert, a merchant who worked in his father's mills. Through her mother-in-law, Ida Bienert, she was introduced to the circle of Bauhaus artists. In 1925, she opened her own dance school, the Palucca School of Dance, with the support of her husband, after which she and Mary Wigman became competitors. In 1927, she opened a branch of her school in Berlin. In 1931, another branch was opened in Stuttgart. In 1939, because of her Jewish ancestry the National Socialistic authorities closed her schools and she was not allowed to teach dance lessons, however she was permitted to continue dancing herself and in 1936 she even appeared in the Olympic Games in Berlin. In 1945, during the air raid on Dresden, Palucca lost all her possessions. After 1945, the Russian style of ballet dominated the training in Palucca school.Palucca dance school – history She became founding member of the East German Academy of Arts. In 1959, East German culture policy officials wanted to see the school transformed into a Soviet-style socialist professional school of dance.

History The band was founded in 1982 in Angers, France, by singer/keyboardist Denis Péan and Richard Bourreau (violin/kora). These two have remained central to Lo'Jo throughout their history. For several years, with a rotating cast of members, they played events locally, working with acrobats, street theatre, mime, dancers and film as part of their overall presentation. They have subsequently maintained a communal lifestyle, based in Angers. By the end of the 1980s, they were playing throughout Europe and had appeared in New York as part of an artists' collective. Including Nicholas 'Kham' Meslien (bass) and Matthieu Rousseau (drums) (later replaced by Franck Vaillant), they consolidated their line-up, and their first album, Fils de Zamal, was released in 1993. In 1995 the group added Berber singer/saxophonist Yamina Nid El Mourid and her sister, Nadia, who brought a strong North African influence to the music. In 1996, the new lineup recorded Sin Acabar, and 1997 saw them complete Mojo Radio, both with English producer Justin Adams. Upon the latter's release they found more acclaim in the world music community, getting them on the WOMAD circuit. In 1999, they journeyed to Bamako, Mali, to begin work on Bohème de Cristal. While in Mali, they became involved in the organization of the Desert Music Festival held in January 2001. They have also collaborated with a wide variety of musicians, including Tinariwen.

Bezenšek was born in a small village of Bezenškovo Bukovje near Frankolovo, Slovenia, in what was then the Austrian Duchy of Styria. He attended the Celje First Grammar School at the age of 12 and graduated with honours. In 1873 he was elected for a chairman of a school student organization, and learnt the Croatian adaptation of Gabelsberger Shorthand. Later, he entered the University of Zagreb, where he studied Greek, Latin, and Bulgarian in the philosophy faculty. As a student, he delivered a shorthand course, which was attended by 236 people in 5 years. After graduating, Bezenšek visited Prague, Dresden and Ljubljana, obtained a teaching permission, and worked in Zagreb as a chief stenographer in Parliament. In his 1890 biographic notes, he expressed ideas about a common South Slavic shorthand system: \\"It would be of benefit to the spread of shorthand among South Slavs to establish a South-Slavic Shorthand Union, like the German or Northern Shorthand Union, [...] it should have an agency of its own and should hold an annual congress once in Zagreb, once in Belgrade, once in Sofia, once in Ljubljana.\\" Responding to an invitation from the Bulgarian government, and after being recommended by his colleague Spas Vatsov, Bezenšek moved to the recently formed Kingdom in 1879, and worked as a chief stenographer at the National Assembly in Sofia. He agreed on a salary, which was lower than what he could have earned for a professorship. On 25 September 1879 he conducted the first shorthand course in Bulgaria. In 1884 one of the chief stenographer's students reported against him, and Bezenšek was fired from his job at the National Assembly, but instead of accepting proposals for a return to Slovenia and Croatia, he decided to move to Plovdiv, which was then the capital of Eastern Rumelia. From 1885 until 1905, he worked in high schools there, introducing Ethics into the curriculum, as well as applying modern methodologies for studying foreign languages -- e.g. his New practical manual for easily learning the German language (). Bezenšek moved to Sofia again in 1906, and stayed there till his death. He remained an active scholar, issued a lot of publications and translations, and had been a lecturer at the Sofia University from 1911. Bezenšek played a significant role for fostering the dialogue between Bulgarians and Slovenians, publishing a number of works in Slovenian on Bulgarian matters and vice versa.

Founded in 1927, the club was Philadelphia's first professional hockey team and played in the Canadian-American Hockey League. The team changed its name to the Philadelphia Ramblers beginning with the 1935-36 season when it became affiliated with the NHL New York Rangers. The following season and Ramblers and the C-AHL began playing an interlocking schedule with the International Hockey League for two seasons before the two circuits formally merged to form a new International American Hockey League (renamed the American Hockey League in 1940) in June, 1938. (The Ramblers continued to play in this league until folding in 1941.) The Arrows'/Ramblers' coach and manager from 1929 to 1941 was Hall of Fame defenseman and Hart Trophy winner Herb Gardiner. Members of the Arrows included future Hart Trophy winner Tommy Anderson, and future Chicago Black Hawk defenseman Art Coulter. When the NHL Pittsburgh Pirates hockey team moved to Philadelphia in 1930 as the Philadelphia Quakers, they lasted only one season due in part to the fact that the Arrows out-drew them in attendance as well as the NHL club's poor performance on the ice winning just four games (4-36-4) of their 44-game schedule. The Arrows, like the Ramblers, played at the Philadelphia Arena.

This article touches upon only those parts of the canonical legislation which may seem in any way to individualize the discipline of the Church in the United States or depict the peculiar needs and difficulties of its nascent period. Individual Provincial Councils First Provincial Council The First Provincial Council was held in 1829 and was attended by the archbishop and four bishops. Its decrees refer to the enactments of two previous conventions. Bishop John Carroll's Diocesan Synod of 1791 decreed: (No. 3) The ceremonies of baptism need not be supplied for converted heretics who had been previously validly baptized. (No. 4) As a rule children may not receive Confirmation before the age of reason. (No. 5) The offerings of the faithful are to be divided into three parts: for the support of the pastor, the relief of the poor and the sustentation of the church. (No. 11) The faithful are to be warned that the absolution of priests not approved by the bishop is invalid. (No. 15) None are to be married until they know the Christian Doctrine. Slaves need know only the principal truths, if more cannot be acquired. (No. 16) In mixed marriages the non-Catholic must promise before witnesses to bring up the offspring of the union as Catholics. (No. 17) Hymns and prayers in the vernacular (e.g. English, not Latin) are to be encouraged at evening services. (No. 20) Catholics may work on days of obligation owing to the circumstances of place, but they must hear Mass if possible. (No. 23) The rich are to be warned that they sin grievously if, through their parsimony, pastors cannot be sustained and multiplied. (No. 24) When there is question of refusing Christian burial, the bishop must be consulted beforehand when possible. The second series of enactments of the First Council referred to are the articles concerning ecclesiastical discipline sanctioned by the common consent of the Archbishop of Baltimore and the other American bishops in 1810. The main articles are: (No. 2) Regulars should not be withdrawn from pastoral work without the consent of the bishops, if their assistance be deemed a necessity to the existence or prosperity of their missions. (No. 3) The Douay version of the Bible is to be used. (No. 5) Baptism must be conferred in the church where possible. (No. 6) If no sponsor can be obtained, private baptism only is to be administered. (No. 9) The faithful are to be warned against improper theatres, dances and novels. (No. 10) Freemasons cannot be admitted to the sacraments. Besides ordering the publication of these decrees along with their own synodical enactments, the fathers of the First Provincial Council decreed: (No. 1) Priests should labour in any mission assigned to them by the bishops. (No. 5) Owing to the abuses of lay trustees all future churches should be consigned to the bishop when possible. (No. 6) Trustees cannot institute or dismiss a pastor. No ecclesiastical patronage exists in this country. (No. 10) Infants of non-Catholics may be baptized if their parents promise to give them a Catholic education, but the sponsor must be a Catholic. (No. 20) In administering the sacraments and in the burial service, Latin and not English must be employed. (No. 31) A ceremonial written in English is to be drawn up. (No. 34) Catholic schools should be erected. At one of the sessions of this council several lawyers (among them Roger B. Taney, afterwards Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States) gave advice to the bishops on points of American law concerning property rights and ecclesiastical courts. In addition to their decrees, the bishops asked and obtained from Rome permission to use for adults the formula of infant baptism; to consecrate baptismal water with the form approved for the missionaries of Peru and to extend the time for fulfilling the paschal precept, i.e. from the first Sunday of Lent to Trinity Sunday. Second Provincial Council The Second Council, held in 1833, was attended by the archbishop and nine bishops. The main decrees were: (No. 3) A delimitation of the American dioceses. (No. 4) A method of selecting bishops, which a later Council (Prov. VII) modified. (No. 5) Recommending the entrusting to the Jesuits of the Indian missions in the West, as also (No. 6) the missions among former American slaves, repatriated in Liberia, West Africa, to the same fathers. (No. 8) Bishops are exhorted to erect ecclesiastical seminaries. Third Provincial Council The Third Council in 1837 was composed of the archbishop and eight bishops. Its decrees enacted: (No. 4) Ecclesiastical property is to be secured by the best means the civil law affords. (No. 6) Ecclesiastics should not bring ecclesiastical cases before the civil tribunals. (No. 7) Priests are prohibited from soliciting money outside their own parishes. (No. 8) Pastors are warned against permitting unsuitable music at Divine worship. (No. 9) The two days following Easter and Pentecost are to be days of obligation no longer. (No. 10) Wednesdays in Advent are not to be days of fast and abstinence. Fourth Provincial Council The Fourth Council in 1840 issued decrees signed by the archbishop and twelve bishops as follows: (No. 1) In mixed marriages no sacred rites or vestments are to be used. (No. 5) Temperance societies are recommended to the faithful. (No. 6) Pastors are to see that those frequenting public school do not use the Protestant version of the Bible or sing sectarian hymns and to employ their influence against the introduction of such practices into the public schools. (No. 8) Bishops are to control ecclesiastical property and not permit priests to hold it in their own name. Among those attending this council was Charles Auguste Marie Joseph, Count of Forbin-Janson, the exiled Bishop of Nancy and Toul, France, to whom the fathers granted a right to a decisive vote. A letter of consolation was sent by the council to the persecuted bishops of Poland, and another of thanks to the moderators of the Leopold Institute of Vienna, Austria. Fifth Provincial Council In 1843, the Fifth Council was attended by the archbishop and sixteen bishops. Among its enactments were: (No. 2) Laymen may not deliver orations in churches. (No. 4) It is not expedient that the Tridentine decrees concerning clandestine matrimony be extended to places where they have not been already promulgated. (No. 5) Pastors must observe the law of residence. (No. 6) Priests may not borrow money for church uses without written permission of the bishop. Sixth Provincial Council The Sixth Council (the archbishop and twenty-two bishops attending) in 1846, decreed: (No. 1) that the Blessed Virgin Mary conceived without sin is chosen as the patron saint of the United States. (No. 2) Priests ordained titulo missionis may not enter a religious order without permission of their ordinaries. (No. 3) The canons concerning the proclaiming of the banns of matrimony are to be observed. At the request of the fathers, the Holy See sanctioned a formula to be used by the bishops in taking the oath at their consecration. Seventh Provincial Council In 1849 two archbishops and twenty-three bishops held the Seventh Council. The main decrees were: (No. 2) The Holy See is to be informed that the fathers think it opportune to define as a dogma the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. (No. 3) A change in the election of bishops in introduced. (No. 5) Bishops are not to give an exeat at the request of a priest unless it be certain that another bishop will receive him. (No. 6) Priests are forbidden to assist at the marriages of those who have already had a ceremony performed by a Protestant minister, or who intend to have such ceremony performed. (No. 7) A national council should be held in Baltimore in 1850, by Apostolic Authority. The fathers moreover petitioned the Holy See to raise the New Orleans, Cincinnati and New York City dioceses to Metropolitan dignity and to make a new limitation of the Provinces of Baltimore and St. Louis. They desired likewise that Baltimore should be declared the primatial see of the Republic. The pope granted the first part of the petition, but deferred acting on the question of primacy. Eighth Provincial Council The Eighth Council was assembled in 1855. The archbishop and seven bishops or their representatives attended it. This council enacted: (No. 1) The fathers joyfully receive the dogmatic decision of the pope defining the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. (No. 2) Priests are warned that after August, 1857, adults must be baptized according to the regular formula for that service in the Roman Ritual and not according to that for infant baptism. (No. 4) No tax is to be demanded for dispensations from matrimonial impediments. (No. 6) Bishops are exhorted to increase the number of their diocesan consultors to ten or twelve, but it will not be necessary to obtain the opinion of all of them, even on important matters, the counsel of three or four will suffice. On the death of the bishop, all the consultors shall send to the archbishop their written opinions as to an eligible successor for the vacant see. (No. 7) The various diocesan synods should determine on the best mode of providing for the proper support of the bishop. (No. 8) The fathers desire to see an American College erected in Rome. To the Acts of this council is appended a decree of the Holy See, sanctioning a mode of procedure in judicial causes of clerics. Ninth Provincial Council The Ninth Council in 1858 was attended by the archbishop and seven bishops. The main work of this synod consisted in drawing up petitions to the Holy See concerning a dispensation from abstinence on Saturdays; the conceding of certain honorary privileges to the Archbishop of Baltimore; the granting to the bishops the permission to allow the Blessed Sacrament to be kept in chapels of religious communities not subject to the law of enclosure. All of these petitions were granted by the Holy See. That concerning the Archbishop of Baltimore granted to him, as ruler of the mother-church of the United States, an honorary pre- eminence, to consist in his taking precedence of any other archbishop in the country, without regard to promotion or consecration, and in his having the place of honour in all councils and conventions. The fathers also sent to Rome an inquiry as to the nature of the vows (solemn or simple) of religious women, especially of Visitation Nuns in the United States, an answer to which was deferred to a later time (1864). The question was also discussed whether Archbishop Kenrick's version of the Bible should be approved for general use. It was finally decided to wait for Dr John Henry Newman's expected version, and then to determine along with the bishops of other English-speaking countries on one common version. Tenth Provincial Council In 1869, the Tenth Council enacted decrees that were signed by the archbishop, twelve bishops and one abbot. These decrees included: *(No. 5) Bishops are exhorted to establish missions and schools for the Negroes (African Americans) of their dioceses. The Council Fathers were to provide missions and schools for all Black Americans in their dioceses, as education was seen as a critical need by the community. *(No. 7) Priests are to be appointed to aid the bishops in administering the temporal concerns of the diocese. They are also to supervise the spiritual and material affairs of religious women. At the request of the fathers, the Holy See extended for five years the privilege of using the short formula in the baptism of adults. It should be remarked that the first seven provincial councils of Baltimore were practically, though not formally, plenary councils of the United States.

Biography Eisenstein was born in 1946 in Chicago, Illinois and has lived there most of her life. While attending college at the University of Chicago, she met her future husband Alex at a weekly gathering of Chicago's science fiction fandom. In 1966, shortly after attending Tricon, the 24th World Science Fiction Convention, they were married. She continued college until Alex entered the U. S. Air Force and, following basic training, was posted to Germany; they lived there for three years and then returned to Chicago upon his honorable discharge from the service. Eisenstein had her first two science fiction stories published in 1971, the first in collaboration with husband Alex (he continues to be her writing partner for certain stories). After establishing herself as a professional writer, she returned to college and finished her education, earning a 1981 B.A. degree in anthropology from the University of Illinois. She has published six novels and more than forty shorter works of varying lengths in the genres of science fiction, fantasy, and horror fiction; Eisenstein also wrote a popular non-fiction book on the treatment of arthritis. Her stories have appeared in both anthologies and in every major science fiction and fantasy print media magazine; these include The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, Analog Science Fiction and Fact, Galaxy Science Fiction, Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, Amazing Stories, Weird Tales, and others. Eisenstein's stories have been nominated twice for science fiction's Hugo Award and three times for SFWA's Nebula Award. Her 1978 short story \\"Lost and Found\\" was adapted for television in 1986, airing on the mid-1980s series The New Twilight Zone; the screenplay was written by the show's then story editor George R. R. Martin. She is an old friend of Martin and convinced him to include dragons in his international best-selling fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire. Martin then dedicated the third novel in the series, A Storm of Swords, to Eisenstein. Eisenstein has spent much of her adult life teaching writing; this began by assisting author Roger Zelazny at the Indiana University Writers Conference in 1977. She has taught writing at the Clarion Science Fiction Writer's Workshop at Michigan State University, Oakton Community College of Skokie, Illinois, and the Writer's Digest School. For twenty years she was a member of the part-time faculty of Columbia College Chicago, teaching courses in general science fiction, popular fiction writing, fantasy, and advanced science fiction writing. In 1999 Eisenstein received an \\"Excellence in Teaching\\" Award from this institution; in 2009 she retired from CCC to devote more time to her professional writing career. Beginning in 2000, Eisenstein worked full-time in Chicago's very competitive advertising business; she was the executive manager of copy editors at Chicago's largest advertising agency until she retired in 2015. The completed novel, The City in Stone, the last volume of her \\"Book of Elementals\\" fantasy trilogy, was left unpublished when Meisha Merlin Publishing, a well-established fantasy and science fiction publisher, suddenly ceased operations in 2007;Science-Fiction and Fantasy Books by Phyllis Eisenstein, Great Science-Fiction & Fantasy Works the novel remains unpublished, while the first two novels in the series are currently out-of-print. Eisenstein has since completed The Walker Between Worlds, the first novel in a new series called \\"The Masks of Power\\".

She served as a commissioned ship for 20 months. Athene (AKA-22) was laid down on 20 January 1944 under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1883) at Providence, R.I., by the Walsh-Kaiser Co., Inc.; launched on 18 June 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Emily Thornton; and acquired by the Navy and commissioned on 29 September 1944, Comdr. Edward R. Nelson, Jr., in command. Service history 1944 On 10 October, the attack transport got underway for shakedown training in the Chesapeake Bay. She left the east coast on 7 November, bound, via the Panama Canal, for Pearl Harbor. Athene reached Hawaii on 26 November and began a series of training exercises. The transport sailed for Eniwetok on 27 January 1945 and continued on to Saipan, arriving there on 11 February. Athene conducted two days of training exercises for troops scheduled to invade Iwo Jima. She sailed on 16 February, with officers and men of the 5th Marine Division embarked, and dropped anchor off Iwo Jima on the 19th. Athene began discharging her passengers on 27 February and got underway for Saipan the next day. Athene returned to Pearl Harbor on 28 June to take on more supplies. She put back to sea on 12 July, bound for the Philippines with intermediate stops at Eniwetok and Ulithi. The attack transport anchored off Leyte on 30 July. For the duration of the war, she shuttled troops and cargo between islands in the Philippine archipelago. 1945 After Japan surrendered, she got underway on 7 September for Yokosuka. Athene was moored in Tokyo Bay on 18 September when, due to a typhoon, the ship collided with LST-844, dragged anchor into this ship causing slight damage to the bow and cutting the LST-844 bow anchor chain at the 82 fathom mark, thus causing the LST-844 to remain underway until the typhoon abated. This necessitated a repair period at Yokosuka, which lasted through 1 October. One month later, Athene began a voyage back to the United States. She paused at Saipan to embark homeward- bound troops and finally reached San Francisco on 23 November. Athene returned to Saipan late in December to bring back more troops. While underway to the west coast, she developed boiler trouble and was diverted to Pearl Harbor on 14 January 1946 for repairs. 1946 The attack cargo ship resumed her voyage on 18 January and moored at San Pedro, California, on the 25th of January. She then proceeded to San Francisco. Later that month, Athene was assigned to Joint Task Force 1, which was the atomic bomb test unit at Bikini Atoll. Following her return from Bikini, Athene was decommissioned at Pearl Harbor on 17 June 1946. Decommissioning Her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 August 1947, and the ship was transferred to the Maritime Commission on 23 September 1947. She was sold in 1960 to the Union Minerals and Alloy Corp., of New York City, and scrapped. Athene earned two battle stars for her World War II service.

One of the earliest Christian saints in Ireland, he is known as Saint Patrick's \\"Threin Fhir\\", or \\"Strong Man\\" for his dedication and faithfulness to the fledgling Church. His feast day is 24 March. Legend Saint Macartan grew up in the southern part of Ireland, somewhere in Munster. Before his conversion to Christianity by Patrick, the future saint was known by the name Aidus/Aedh, the son of Caerthen (son of the Rowan Tree). The identity of his father is uncertain, but is sometimes associated with a Dalcassian prince of Thomond or with the Uí Maine of Connacht. Hence the Anglicized later name to come down to us is \\"Macartan\\".\\"Saint Macartan: Our Patron Saint\\", Saint Macartan's college Some sources claim that he was uncle to Saint Brigid.MACARTAN 1500: Church of Ireland Hearing of Patrick's teaching, Aidus traveled from his home to hear him preach in Armagh, leaving behind his wife and child. He first met Patrick at Drumlease, near Dromahair, County Leitrim. Here Macartan was baptized and soon became one of Patrick's official missionary staff. He was spoken of as Patrick's \\"champion\\" or \\"strong man\\". We are told that when the great Apostle was worn out by his work that Macartan supported his faltering steps over rough roads, marshes and rivers by carrying him. Macartan was initially ordained to the role of presbyter (priest) while Patrick was still living, possible by Patrick himself. He was the \\"staff of Patrick\\" in the Irish patron saint's declining years. On one occasion after carrying Patrick over a river, an exhausted Macartan expressed a wish that he might be relieved from further travel and allowed settle down in charge of some church close-by his beloved master where he could spend the evening of his life in peace. Patrick, full of sympathy for his faithful companion and friend, agreed that he should establish a monastery in Clogher, and finish out his life there. A monastery was established near the ancient royal fort of Rathmore on the outskirts of the town and one of Ireland's oldest bishoprics was established. To commemorate the occasion Patrick gave Macartan his staff and a number of precious relics contained in a shrine known to tradition as the Domhnach Airgid. Domhnach Airgid The Domhnach Airgid (the Silver church) was made to enclose a manuscript that consists of fragments of 39 sheets of the Gospels, written in the distinctively Irish lettering of the eighth or ninth century. On the cover of the Domhnach Airgid is one of the earliest surviving metalwork images of St. Patrick. Traditionally, the book was claimed to be that given by St Patrick himself to his companion St Macartan, making it an object of great veneration. Around 1350, the abbot of Clones, John O Carbry, commissioned a substantial remodelling of the Domhnach Airgid. The figure of St. Patrick is thought to be at the lower right of the cover. In the lower left St. Patrick may be handing the Domhnach Airgid to St. Macartan. The Domhnach Airgid is no. 48 in A History of Ireland in 100 Objects, and can be seen in the National Museum of Ireland.\\"The Domhnach Airgid\\", Cultural Heritage of IrelandA History of Ireland in 100 Objects The Collect of St Macartan's Day Heavenly Father, we thank you for Macartan, faithful companion of Saint Patrick, and builder of your church in Clogher: Build up your church through those whom you call to leadership in this generation, and strengthen your church to proclaim the gospel of reconciliation and peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

In newspapers and online, Stark has written hundreds of reviews of local productions and Broadway tryouts from 1962 to the present. His Boston readers have given him such labels as \\"head theater angel of Massachusetts\\" and \\"Dean of the alternative theater critics.\\"Theater Mirror  Early work  In 1950 Stark discovered EC Comics (publishers of Tales From The Crypt, Weird Science, and MAD among others) and was soon writing enthusiastic letters of comment and criticism on every issue. Publisher Bill Gaines was so impressed with his critiques that he named him \\"EC's Official Number One Fan\\" and bestowed upon him a free subscription to everything EC published, provided that Stark would keep the detailed letters of review coming. EC colorist Marie Severin made a gag sign for Gaines' office that read \\"God help us to write stories that will please Larry Stark!\\" Stark’s letters were occasionally excerpted in the E.C. letters columns but EC fans wanted to read them in their entirety, as Gaines did. The first \\"fanzine\\" to satisfy that demand was Bhob Stewart and Ted White's POTRZEBIE, in which Stewart wrote that “POTRZEBIE’S main purpose in life is to present the criticism of Stark…sans censorship. You rarely get to peruse his monstrous prose other than a few sentences in the E.C. letter columns. EC values his opinions so much that Gaines has given Larry a free lifetime subscription to all the EC Comics on the condition that he will write EC a letter about each issue telling what he liked and didn’t like about it. Now you’ll know too. Thru POTRZEBIE.” Stark’s column was titled ONE MAN’S OPINION and ran through a change in editorship for POTRZEBIE, later continuing in THE EC FAN JOURNAL. Stark made several visits to the EC offices and his \\"Elegy\\" to EC, originally published in HOOHAH #6 (1956), has been reprinted over the years in multiple formats. Most recently it was included in its entirety in \\"American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1950s\\" by Bill Schelly (2013). Between 1950 and 1956, Stark studied English at Rutgers University, leaving New Jersey for Cambridge, Massachusetts in January, 1957. In 1956-57 he co-edited the publication Stellar with Ted White, who recalled: :I lavished more care on the package than I did on the contents. The contents were good. Larry Stark was a good editor -- much better than I, then -- and when he dropped out I'd learned enough from him to keep up the standards, but the material was mostly by other people.SF Five Yearly In the summer and fall of 1957, Stark acted in two Harvard stage productions and then worked backstage at Cambridge theaters for the next five years. In 1962, he began doing theater reviews for MIT's The Tech under the pseudonym Charles Foster Ford.The Tech During this period he used a basement mimeograph machine to print the work of local poets with his Larry Stark Press, notable for publishing Peter Guralnick's first book in 1964. Theater reviews Stark was the first to write theater reviews for the alternative weekly, Boston After Dark, providing a continual coverage of Boston and Broadway-bound productions during the years 1966 to 1972. After circulating his own short-lived review publication, Theatre Journal, he contributed to Time Out, a free college paper published by The Cambridge Phoenix. During the 1980s, he wrote for Wisconsin's La Crosse Tribune. Returning to the Boston area, he acquired a computer which he used to create fiction and also to write theater reviews posted on General Electric's online service, GEnie. In October 1994, he launched Theater Mirror, an informative online guide to New England theatres and stage productions. With insightful reviews and entertaining commentary by Stark, plus a continual flow of reviews submitted by several other contributors, Theater Mirror became a focal point for Boston actors, directors and theatergoers over the years. The Plays Up and Running section of Theater Mirror offers an alphabetical listing of current productions throughout New England with links to theatres from Connecticut to Maine.Plays Up and Running The Theater Mirror Archive has reviews by Stark and others dating back to 1995.Theater Mirror Archive Stark's approach is much like that of film critic Pauline Kael, simply to describe \\"what it's about,\\" and he often attempts to capture the essence of a play stylistically, as in this 2001 review of Conor McPherson's The Weir: :Now it's no secret the Irish is great ones for the tellin of stories, especially in them small rural bars in the Northwest country where Conor McPherson sets his hour and a half slice o'life \\"The Weir\\". Surely there's not much else to do but to drink and to gossip with a few mates of an afternoon. And once a \\"small one\\" or two's been chased down with a bottle of stout, them tales of somethin strange and maybe supernatural just come tumblin out. Better that than a lonely walk home with the wind in yer face, isn't it, now? Stark's book, A Theater Lover's Guide to 90 Theatres in Boston, was published in 2001. For The Tech, 38 years earlier, he wrote A Guide to Harvard Square's 15 Bookstores.\\"A Guide to Harvard Square's 15 Bookstores\\" (February 6, 1963) On August 10, 2006, Stark was honored by the Boston theater community at a special tribute and celebration of his 74th birthday.

Located at the southern tip of the Gettysburg Battlefield on Houck's Ridge, the boulder-strewn Devil's Den proved to be a weak spot in the Union battle line, and was overrun by Confederate troops from Alabama, Texas and Arkansas after fierce fighting.

Aynesworth has been reported to have witnessed the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dealey Plaza, the capture and arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald at the Texas Theater, and the shooting of Oswald by Jack Ruby in the basement of the Dallas Police Headquarters. In a 1976 Texas Monthly article, William Broyles, Jr. described Aynesworth as \\"one of the most respected authorities on the assassination of John F. Kennedy\\". Background Aynesworth is a native of Clarksburg, West Virginia. Having grown up poor, his mother helped provide for the family by taking in laundry and his aunt cleaned houses, including one owned by a man who would later provide him with $100 so he could purchase books in college. Aynesworth graduated from Roosevelt-Wilson High School in Nutter Fort, West Virginia, then attended Salem College in Salem, West Virginia before dropping out after one semester to work in journalism full-time. Journalism Aynesworth's started as a newspaperman in 1948. He first worked in his home state as a freelancer for the Clarksburg Exponent-Telegram. Aynesworth's next two positions were with Donald W. Reynolds-owned newspapers in Fort Smith, Arkansas. From 1950 to 1954, he was a sports editor for the Fort Smith Times Record making $32/week. At the age of 23, he was then hired as managing editor of the Southwest American. According to Aynesworth, at that time he may have been the youngest managing editor of a daily newspaper in the United States. He also conducted his first interview with a murderer while working at the American. In 1957, Aynesworth left the American after a dispute with Reynolds regarding compensation. Aynesworth was a business writer for the Dallas Times Herald at 26, then was hired to work for United Press International in their Denver, Colorado news bureau in 1959. While in Denver, he was stabbed in the throat by an unknown man who broke down his apartment door one night. Those who speculated on the motivation for the attack believed Aynesworth may have been targeted in a case of mistaken identity or by a jealous husband. Aynesworth himself reported he thought that the Teamsters may have been involved due to a story on which the UPI was working at the time. While still bandaged from the attack, he interviewed and was hired by the Dallas Morning News in 1960. Aynesworth covered the United States space program for the Dallas Morning News as a space and aviation reporter, a position he held at the time of the Kennedy assassination in 1963. In 1967, he started for Newsweek in their Houston bureau, where he eventually succeeded Philip Carter as head of that bureau. Returning to the Dallas Times Herald where he first began working in the 1950s, Aynesworth was an investigative chief in 1975. At ABC News, Aynesworth was an investigator for 20/20. In the mid-1990s, he was the Dallas/Southwest bureau chief of The Washington Times. In 2007, Aynesworth was elected President of the 300-member Press Club of Dallas, an organization of which he had been a member since the early 1960s. He has served on the board of directors for The Texas Observer's MOLLY National Journalism Prize. Aynesworth has been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize six times, and has been a finalist four times. 1963: the Kennedy assassination According to Aynesworth, he was scheduled to interview a scientist at Southern Methodist University on November 22, 1963. He said that he saw Jack Ruby around 11:30 that morning in the employee's cafeteria of the Dallas Morning News before Ruby went upstairs to place an advertisement for his nightclub. Aynesworth said he decided to take a long lunch hour and walk over to watch Kennedy's motorcade from in front of the Dallas County Records Building. With the crowds two to three people deep on Main Street, he positioned himself in the middle of Elm Street on the corner of Elm and North Houston Street to obtain a clearer view. Aynesworth described hearing a first shot as possibly backfire from a motorcycle, and recognizing a second and a third shot as coming from a rifle. He described the scene immediately afterwards as \\"total chaos\\". Aynesworth reported that activity converged upon the Texas School Book Depository, and that he did not enter the building possibly for fear of running into a gunman. He said he started interviewing people and, as he was without paper, began taking notes on a \\"bunch of envelopes\\" he had in his pocket. According to Aynesworth, he interviewed people in the area and received information that turned out to be false or contradicted the statements of other witnesses. Aynesworth positioned himself near a three- wheeled police motorcycle in front of the Texas School Book Depository in order to listen to the voice traffic and find out what was happening. He stated that police radio transmissions, as well as the number of police entering the building, gave him the impression that a gunman was on the building's roof. Aynesworth described listening to the police radio and hearing what turned out to be the first report of the shooting of J. D. Tippit in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas by a citizen using the radio in Tippit's police car. He said he instructed another reporter to stay at the Texas School Book Depository and followed the police to the scene of the shooting in a WFAA mobile unit. He was with the police when they entered the Texas Theater searching for Oswald, and he saw Oswald's attempt to shoot Officer Nick McDonald. Two days later, Aynesworth was talked into going to the Dallas Police Headquarters by his wife and then saw Ruby lunge and shoot Oswald. In the aftermath of the events in November 1963, Aynesworth became an investigative reporter who was reported to have \\"broken almost every major assassination story\\". He worked on the story for some time after Kennedy was shot and became the lead reporter for the Dallas Morning News regarding the assassination. Aynesworth broke the story of Oswald's escape route, and had the first major interview with Marina Oswald. Having not told it to the Warren Commission, Marina had told him that she persuaded Oswald not to assassinate Richard Nixon. Aynesworth, to the consternation of the Warren Commission, also obtained and published the Oswald diaries. Aynesworth has been reported to have spent much of his career attempting to refute conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination. He supports the official conclusion that Oswald acted alone and believes that conspiracy theories have been generated by people motivated by money and fame. In an interview in 1979 on KERA, the Dallas PBS affiliate, he said, \\"I'm not saying there wasn't a conspiracy. I know most people in this country believe there was a conspiracy. I just refuse to accept it and that's my life's work.\\" 1967: the Jim Garrison investigation In 1967, Aynesworth had just begun working in Newsweek's Houston bureau at the time of the Jim Garrison investigation. He said Garrison invited him to New Orleans to \\"compare notes\\". According to Aynesworth, \\"[Garrison] was paranoid as hell, but he was no fool.\\" Described as Garrison's \\"nemesis\\", he worked openly with Clay Shaw's attorneys to defend Shaw against Jim Garrison. Irvin Dymond characterized Aynesworth's help in the case as \\"crucial\\". In the May 15, 1967 issue of Newsweek, Aynesworth wrote: \\"Jim Garrison is right. There has been a conspiracy in New Orleans - but it is a plot of Garrison's own making.\\" According to Aynesworth, Garrison fabricated conspiracy allegations for \\"politically opportunistic reasons\\" and had attempted to bribe potential witnesses. Garrison initially replied only that the article was \\"unworthy of comment\\", but later provided a more substantive reply in the October 1967 issue of Playboy. Garrison himself later responded to Aynesworth's claims: \\"As for the $3,000 bribe, by the time I came across Aynesworth's revelation, the witness our office had supposedly offered it to, Alvin Babeouf, had admitted to us that it never happened.\\" Aynesworth has been very critical of Garrison throughout the years. Addressing a 1991 article written by Mark Seal that discussed Garrison's influence on Oliver Stone's JFK, Ayensworth said: \\"There is simply no way that a rational person - with any knowledge of Mr. Garrison and his background the assassination - could believe that he really knew anything about the assassination that he didn't read first in the very publications he now mocks.\\" In a 1998 interview, Aynesworth said: \\"Garrison was one of the sickest people that I've ever known. There's no doubt in my mind that the man was insane! Despite being brilliant in many ways, he knew the arts, famous things in history, and he was learned. The man was a devious, nasty man who committed more crimes in his investigation than anybody that he ever accused.\\" 1980: Ted Bundy In 1980, Stephen Michaud, a former Business Week reporter, enlisted the help of Aynesworth in interviewing serial killer Ted Bundy, who initially claimed he was innocent and was interested in cooperating on a book. The two Newsweek colleagues conducted a series of interviews with Bundy and eventually authored two books about the killer. The New York Daily News called their portrait of Bundy, The Only Living Witness, one of the ten best true-crime books ever written. Their second book on the subject, Conversations with a Killer, contained edited transcripts of the interviews. 1986: Henry Lee Lucas In 1986, Aynesworth and Jim Henderson, also of the Dallas Times Herald, were named as finalists for the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting \\"[f]or their persistent and thorough investigation of self-proclaimed mass murderer Henry Lee Lucas, which exposed him as the perpetrator of a massive hoax.\\" Their work showed that Lucas could not have killed more than a hundred people that the Texas Rangers claimed he had. Aynesworth and Henderson's work led to President George W. Bush commuting Lucas' death sentence. 1993: Waco siege In 1993, Aynesworth covered the siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, once referring to it as \\"[t]he Branch Davidian massacre\\". Commenting on the event in an interview, he said: \\"I couldn't believe I stood there and watched people burn in that. I couldn't believe what was happening.\\" Other Aynesworth has been reported to have \\"interviewed John F. Kennedy in the shower [and] Lyndon B. Johnson in bed\\". According to one report: \\"He also tracked down the person who stole \\"most of\\" eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes' money, chased James Earl Ray all over the South and into Canada after he shot the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\\" According to Aynesworth, he was asked to serve as a pallbearer for Jack Ruby and played basketball with Fidel Castro. He said that he was playing outside of Havana: \\"And all of a sudden, this Jeep drives up and a bearded gentleman gets out and puts on his tennis shoes and joins us. I'd been having trouble getting an interview, and after that, it came a little easier. I told him that I would let him win.\\" Recapping his career, Aynesworth stated in one interview: \\"I've been offered bribes and threatened and maligned and witnessed some of the most horrifying events of our lifetime.\\" Author Aynesworth co-authored seven books with Stephen G. Michaud. His 2003 book JFK: Breaking the News is \\"a companion piece to a documentary on the 40th anniversary of the event.\\" Bibliography  Later life As of 2016, Aynesworth lived in Dallas.

He is venerated in the Roman Catholic Church as Saint Cellach. Though a member of the laicized ecclesiastical dynasty of Clann Sínaig, he took holy vows and gained priestly ordination. This put an end to the anomalous state of affairs, in effect since 966, whereby the supreme head of the Irish Church had been a layman.Ó Fiaich (1969), p. 94 Following the Synod of Ráith Bressail, in which a diocesan structure for Ireland was established, he became the first metropolitan primate of all Ireland. Early life and background Cellach was the son of Áed mac Máele Ísu meic Amalgada of the Clann Sínnaig. Áed had been abbot of Armagh and Coarb Pátraic (\\"heir\\" or \\"successor\\" of Saint Patrick; head of the church of Armagh) from 1074 to 1091. The Clann Sínaig, of the Uí Echdach sept of the Airthir in Airgialla, had monopolized the office of abbot of Armagh since 966. In later historiography Clann Sínaig has been associated with the type of secularisation that made a church reform necessary, described by Marie Térèse Flanagan as an \\"hereditarily entrenched laicized ecclesiastical dynasty\\" and even less flattering denounced by Bernard of Clairvaux as that \\"generatio mala et adultera\\".F.J.Byrne, \\"Irish Kings and High-Kings\\", pp. 118, 125Flanagan (2004), \\"Cellach (1080–1129)\\" Coarb Pátraic Following the death of his granduncle Domnall mac Amalgada in August 1105, Cellach succeeded as abbot of Armagh and Coarb Pátraic. The Annals of Ulster notes that this was done \\"by the choice of the men of Ireland\\".AU 1105.3 Unlike his lay predecessors/ancestors, he sought priestly ordination, which Flanagan has described as a \\"decisive reform step\\". It was in accordance with the first Synod of Cashel (1101), which had legislated against laymen holding ecclesiastical offices. He received orders Saturday 23 September 1105, on \\"the feast of Adomnán\\". It passed six weeks from Domnalls death to Cellachs ordination, it has been suggested by Martin Holland that this delay was in order for the ordination to take place on the Saturday-emberday in September. Holland suggests that this may imply that the consideration for canonicity at Armagh was in \\"better shape\\" than other sources might led us to believe.Holland (2005), \\"The Ordination of Cellach\\" The incumbent bishop of Armagh, Cáenchomrac Ó Baígill, died in 1106. This offered the opportunity for Cellach to unite the abbatial and episcopal office, and when he the same year visited Munster he \\"assumed the orders of a noble bishop by the command of the men of Ireland\\".AU 1106.6 That this was done in Munster may be an indication of the influence held by Muirchertach Ua Briain (Murrough O'Brian) over ecclesiastical matters. The recent bishops of Dublin and Waterford had been consecrated in Canterbury by the archbishops Lanfranc and Anselm; Gilla Pátraic in 1074, Donngus Ua hAingliu in 1085, Samuel Ua hAingliu and Máel Ísu Ua hAinmire in 1096. There is no indication that Canterbury was involved in the consecration of Cellach, and when Gille Espaic was consecrated as the first bishop of Limerick this was probably done by Cellach.Flanagan, High- kings with opposition, pp. 914-916 Gilla received a letter from Anselm congratulating him on his elevation to the see of Limerick, and there was no suggestion that Anselm felt Canterbury had been slighted or ought to have been involved. A number of visitations made by Cellach as bishop (and later archbishop) are recorded in the Irish annals: He visited Cenél nEógain in 1106, Munster in 1106 and 1120, Connacht in 1108 and 1116, and Mide in 1110.AU 1106.4, 1106.6, 1108.3, 1110.12, 1116.1, 1120.4, AFM 1106.16 1106.17 1110.13 1116.13 The records of the visitations are followed by formulas such as \\"and he obtained a full tribute\\" or \\"brought away his full dues\\", indicating the official character of ecclesiastical submission embedded in such visitation.His \\"dues\\" as Coarb Pátraic are elaborated by glossing hands for his visitations in 1106: \\"...brought away his full due, i.e. a cow for every six persons or an in-calf heifer for every three or half an ounce for every four, along with many offerings also.\\" (AU 1106.4) and \\"brought away his full visitation, i.e. seven cows and seven sheep and half an ounce for every cantred in Mumu, along with many valuables also\\" (AU 1106.6) Cellach also conducted negotiations between rivalling secular rulers, in particular between Muirchertach Ua Briain and the Northern Uí Néill claimant for high-kingship, Domnall Ua Lochlainn of the Cenel nEógain. There are records of Cellach making \\"a year's peace\\" between these two in the entries of the Annals of Ulster for 1107, 1109 and 1113.AU 1107.8 1109.5, 1113.7 and 1113.8 During his incumbency the priory of Sts. Peter and Paul at Armagh was re-founded by Imar, the learned preceptor of St. Malachy. This was the first establishment in Ireland into which the Canons Regular of St. Augustine had been introduced.Coleman, Ambrose. \\"Armagh.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 8 Mar. 2014 Synod of Ráith Bressail and Dublin Cellach attended and played a prominent part in the Synod of Rathbreasail in 1111. This synod, presided by Gilla EspaicHolland, Gille (Gilbert) of Limerick as papal legate and attended by fifty bishops, three hundred priests and over three thousand laymen, marked the transition of the Irish church from a monastic to a diocesan and parish-based church. It established two metropolitan provinces, with archbishoprics at Armagh and Cashel. Prominence was given to Armagh, making Cellach the primate of the church in Ireland. Each province consisted of twelve territorial dioceses. The see of Dublin was not included, as Dublin hitherto had been under primacy from Canterbury,The see of Waterford however, where the incumbent bishop Máel Ísu Ua hAinmire also had been consecrated in, and taken vows of obedience to, Canterbury, was moved to Lismore, and Máel Ísu chosen as the first archbishop of Cashel. but according to Martin Holland, a place was left open for it, in the sense that only eleven dioceses was declared under Cashel.Holland (2005), \\"Church reform...\\" Flanagan however, asserts that \\"the decrees of the Synod of Ráith Bressail... ...had envisaged the absorption of Dublin into the newly created adjacent diocese of Glendalough\\". When bishop Samuel of Dublin died in 1121 A.D, Cellach claimed supremacy for Armagh over Dublin. The Annals of Ulster state that he \\"assumed the bishopric of Áth Cliath [Dublin]\\" and adds that this was \\"by the choice of foreigners and Irish\\",AU 1121.7 i.e. with the support of both the Norse and Irish population. There was obviously some significant resistance against this in Dublin however, subdeacon called Gréne was quickly bishop by a party in the city and sent to Canterbury, where he was consecrated by archbishop Ralph d'Escures 2 October 1121. According to Holland, it took Gréne some years before he gained possession of the see after his return, but when he did Dublin \\"stood apart from the newly organized Irish church\\". Flanagan gives a different interpretation, that Gréne was accepted as bishop of Dublin as part of some subsequent agreement, \\"probably in return for acknowledging the primacy of Cellach\\". Death In 1129 on a visitation of Munster he died and was buried in Lismore at his own request. Cellach was succeeded by Máel Máedóc Ua Morgair. Visio Tnugdali The Visio Tnugdali written c.1149 refers to Cellach as follows- When Saint Ruadan had fallen silent, Tundale looked happily about him and saw Saint Patrick of Ireland, dressed in shining robes alongside many bishops decked out in their finest regalia. They were all joyful and there was no sound of any sighing! Among that blessed company Tundale could see four bishops whom he recognised. They were all good men; one of them was Saint Cellach, a former archbishop of Armagh, who did much good for the sake of Our Lord. Another was Malachias O'Moore, who had become archbishop of Armagh after him and gave everything that he had to the poor. He founded a large number of churches and colleges, as many as forty-four in all, endowed them with land and rents and so allowed many men of religion to serve God devotedly, although he hardly retained enough for himself to live on.

In each of the books, a fictional diary of a real female figure of royalty as a child throughout world history was written by the author. The Royal Diaries was a spin-off of Scholastic's popular Dear America series. While Dear America, My Name Is America, and My America were all cancelled in 2004, The Royal Diaries continued until 2005. Unlike Dear America, which consisted of diaries of young girls living during pivotal periods in American history, The Royal Diaries is a series that features women of royalty from all over the world. The series is fictional, though it involves real historical figures. Facts and images concerning the historical figure featured in the book are given at the end of each of the books. Subjects in The Royal Diaries The Royal Diaries has covered many famous women in royalty, including Jahanara, Marie Antoinette, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Queen Elizabeth I, Mary, Queen of Scots, Isabella I of Castile, Cleopatra VII, the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna, Catherine the Great, Empress Elisabeth, and Queen Victoria. The series has also covered less known women, such as Anacaona of the Taínos, Weetamoo of the Pocassets, the Lady of Ch'iao Kuo of the Hsien, the Lady of Palenque of the Mayans, and Nzingha of Ndongo. It also covers the life and customs of these women. The target age for these books is nine to twelve.

Similar in many regards to nitromethane, nitroethane is an oily liquid at standard temperature and pressure. Pure nitroethane is colorless and has a fruity odor.  Preparation  Nitroethane is produced industrially by treating propane with nitric acid at 350–450 °C. This exothermic reaction produces four industrially significant nitroalkanes: nitromethane, nitroethane, 1-nitropropane, and 2-nitropropane. The reaction involves free radicals, such as CH3CH2CH2O., which arise via homolysis of the corresponding nitrite ester. These alkoxy radicals are susceptible to C—C fragmentation reactions, which explains the formation of a mixture of products.Sheldon B. Markofsky “Nitro Compounds, Aliphatic” in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. . Alternatively, nitroethane can be produced by the Victor Meyer reaction of haloethanes such as chloroethane, bromoethane, or iodoethane with silver nitrite in diethyl ether or THF. The Kornblum modification of this reaction uses sodium nitrite in either a dimethyl sulfoxide or dimethylformamide solvent. Uses Via condensations like the Henry reaction, nitroethane converts to several compounds of commercial interest. Condensation with 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde affords the precursor to the antihypertensive drug methyldopa; condensation with unsubstituted benzaldehyde yields phenyl-2-nitropropene. Nitroethane condenses with two equivalents of formaldehyde to give, after hydrogenation, 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol, which in turn condenses with oleic acid to give an oxazoline, which protonates to give a cationic surfactant. Like some other nitrated organic compounds, nitroethane is also used as a fuel additive and a precursor to Rocket propellants. Nitroethane is a useful solvent for polymers such as polystyrene and is particularly useful for dissolving cyanoacrylate adhesives. In cosmetics applications, it has been used as a component in artificial nail remover and in overhead ceiling sealant sprays. Nitroethane was previously used successfully as a chemical feedstock (precursor ingredients) in laboratories for the synthesis of multitudes of substances and consumer goods, for e.g. the medicine Pervitin's use was common in the 19th and 20th century (especially popular during WW2 by the allied troops and nazis alike for mood elevation, appetite and sleep suppression and increasing focus, alertness) nitroalkanes were one of many ingredients used in the synthesis of many phenethylamines, including medications such as Pervitin and the racemic compound Benzedrine. an anorexic medicine for obesity . Toxicity Nitroethane is suspected to cause genetic damage and be harmful to the nervous system. Typical TLV/TWA is 100 ppm. Typical STEL is 150 ppm. Skin contact causes dermatitis in humans. In animal studies, nitroethane exposure was observed to cause lacrimation, dyspnea, pulmonary rales, edema, liver and kidney injury, and narcosis.\\"Chemical Sampling Information Nitroethane.\\" Retrieved February 9, 2007, from the website of the US Occupational Safety & Health Administration.

He is believed to have come from the Wicklow area. Life While living in seclusion at Old Connell on the River Liffey in what is now Newbridge Conleth was persuaded by Saint Brigid to make sacred vessels for her convent. Conleth, Tassach of Elphin (Saint Patrick's craftsman), and Daigh (craftsman of Kieran of Saigher were acclaimed the \\"three chief artisans of Ireland\\" during their period. Conleth was head of the Kildare school of metal-work and penmanship.

It was discovered on 15 May 1994, by American astronomer and software engineer Charles de Saint-Aignan after examining films taken at Palomar Observatory, California, and named after American cyclist Lance Armstrong.  Orbital and physical characteristics  Lancearmstrong: orbital diagram The asteroid orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.2–2.7 AU once every 3 years and 10 months (1,401 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 7° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins in 1994, as no precoveries were taken prior to its discovery. Based on an absolute magnitude of 14.2 and an assumed albedo of 0.20, which is typical for bodies with a silicaceous composition, Lancearmstrong measures between 4 and 6 kilometers in diameter. According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid measures 3.3 kilometers in diameter due to an unusually high albedo of 0.449. As of 2016, its composition, shape and rotation period and shape remains unknown.  Naming  This minor planet was named after American Lance Armstrong (born 1971), former professional road racing cyclist. Despite being diagnosed with metastatic testicular cancer, he recovered and returned to cycling. At the time this minor planet was named, he had won the Tour de France three times and encouraged athletes and cancer survivors worldwide. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 November 2001 (). In 2012, Armstrong was stripped of his Tour de France victories after a doping scandal.

The first Battletech based game to be released for the Sega Genesis, it was originally titled simply BattleTech but was later ported to the Super NES by Activision as MechWarrior 3050. The Sega Genesis and Super NES versions are nearly identical, except for their titles. The story takes place during the events of the Clan Invasion in the 3050 era. Players are assigned the role of a Clan Wolf Mechwarrior, who is sent to eliminate several Inner Sphere assets which threaten to destroy the Clan's dominance on the battlefield, and given Timber Wolf/MadCat mech. This video game is viewed in an isometric view as opposed to the first person view of the previous game. The game also features a two-player mode where one player controls the bottom half of the mech to navigate it around the map while the second player controls the gun turret. Reception Though the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly complained that the game's single-player mode is difficult to the point of being inaccessible, all but one of them gave the Genesis version a positive recommendation, citing the diversity of missions, strong challenge, and impressive animations. They scored it a 7.25 out of 10 average. They were evenly split on the Super NES version, with two of them recommending it based on the diversity of levels, and the other two focusing on the frustratingly difficult single player mode and the confusing controls. They scored it a 6.75 out of 10 average. A critic for Next Generation gave it three out of five stars, assessing that, compared to the Genesis original, it has sharper graphics but clunkier animation and worse control. He praised the game itself for its frantic, challenging onslaught of enemies. GamePros Scary Larry was uneasy at how the two-player mode demands that the two players be in perfect sync with each other, and said that the failure to do so could lead to bitter arguments. He also criticized the undetailed graphics, choppy animation, and limited sound effects, but recommended the game for its challenging, strategic, and overall fun gameplay.

It was discovered on 15 May 1994, by American astronomer and software engineer Charles de Saint- Aignan at the Palomar Observatory in California, United States. The asteroid was named for the fictional planet \\"Rakhat\\" in the novel The Sparrow  Orbit and classification  Orbital diagram of Rakhat Rakhat is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 1.8–3.3 AU once every 4 years and 1 month (1,488 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.31 and an inclination of 9° with respect to the ecliptic. A first precovery was taken at the discovering Palomar Observatory in November 1954, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 40 years prior to its official discovery observation.  Naming  This minor planet was named \\"Rakhat\\" after the fictional planet in the novel The Sparrow by Mary Doria Russell. The novel begins in 2019, when SETI at the Arecibo, picks up radio broadcasts of music from this planet in the vicinity of Alpha Centauri. The first expedition is organized by the Jesuit order, known for its missionary, linguistic and scientific activities. The novel was followed by the sequel Children of God. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 28 March 2002 ().  Physical characteristics  Rakhat is an assumed common S-type asteroid. In May 2010, a rotational lightcurve was obtained from photometric observations made astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory in California. It gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.31 in magnitude (). According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's space-based Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.6 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.21, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 4.4 kilometers.

Ancient Nubia was reached by Coptic Christianity by the 2nd century. The Coptic Church was later influenced by Greek Christianity, particularly during the Byzantine era. From the 7th century, the Christian Nubian kingdoms were threatened by the Islamic expansion, but the southernmost of these kingdoms, Alodia, survived until 1504. Southern Sudan (including what is now South Sudan) remained long dominated by traditional (tribal) religions of the Nilotic peoples, with significant conversion to Christianity during the 20th and 21st century. History Coptic Christianity A fresco showing the birth of Jesus, in Faras cathedral Reconstruction of a church in Old Dongola Christianity reached the area of present-day northern Sudan, then called Nubia, by about the end of the first century after Christ. It greatly developed under the influence of the Eastern Roman Empire. Indeed, Byzantine architecture influenced most of the Christian churches in lower Nubia. The Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (reigned 527 to 565) made Nubia a stronghold of Christianity during the Middle Ages. By 580 AD Christianity had become the official religion of the northern Sudan, centered around the Faras cathedral.Sheen J. Freedom of Religion and Belief: A World Report. Routledge, 1997. p. 75. Modern missionary activity During the 19th century, British missionaries re-introduced the Christian faith into South Sudan. British imperial authorities somewhat arbitrarily limited missionary activity to the multi-ethnic southern region. The Church of England and other parts of the Anglican Communion continued to send missionaries and other assistance after the country became independent in 1956, although that also precipitated decades of civil war and persecutions as discussed below. At the 2011 division which split off South Sudan, over 97% of the population in the remaining Sudan, in the north, adheres to Islam. Religions followed by the South Sudanese include traditional indigenous religions, Christianity and Islam. The last census to mention the religion of southerners dates back to 1956 where a majority were classified as following traditional beliefs or were Christian while 18% were Muslim. Scholarly and some U.S. Department of State sources state that a majority of southern Sudanese maintain traditional indigenous (sometimes referred to as animist) beliefs with those following Christianity in a minority (albeit an influential one), which would make South Sudan one of the very few countries in the world where most people follow traditional indigenous religion. However, according to the U.S. State Department's International Religious Freedom Report of 2012 the majority of the population adhere to Christianity, while reliable statistics on animist and Muslim belief are not available. The majority of Christians in Sudan adhere either to the Roman Catholic church or to the Anglican churches (represented by the Episcopal Church of the Sudan), but there are several other small denominations represented there including: * Africa Inland Church * Apostolic Church * Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria * Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church * Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church * Greek Orthodox Church * International church of the Nazarene * Jehovah's Witnesses * New Apostolic * Presbyterian Church of the Sudan * Seventh Day Adventist Church * Sudan Presbyterian Evangelical Church * Sudan Pentecostal Church * Sudan Interior Church * Sudan Church of Christ Roman Catholic missionaries began work in Sudan in 1842; both Anglicans and American Presbyterians began in Sudan in 1899. The Anglicans through the Church Missionary Society had their base in Omdurman, while the Presbyterians began in Khartoum but developed ministry both in the north and in the south. The Sudan Interior Mission began working in the country in 1937. The Africa Inland Mission launched the Africa Inland Church in 1949. In 1964 all foreign missionaries were made to leave southern Sudan because of the civil war. A few groups maintained missionaries in the north. The Sudan Pentecostal Church, which has grown significantly in the south, was started later by the Swedish. , prior to the division of the country, about 2,009,374 Sudanese practiced Roman Catholicism, mainly in the south (5% of the population were devout Roman Catholics). Nine catholic dioceses include two archdioceses in modern Sudan, with five Cathedrals. The patron saint of the Sudan is the former slave Saint Josephine Bakhita, canonized in 2000. About 100,000 people or 0.25% of the population belong to various Protestant denominations in northern Sudan. Catholicism is practised by some thousand followers north of Sudan's capital. A 2015 study estimates some 30,000 Muslim converted to Christianity in Sudan, most of them belonging to some form of Protestantism. Persecution of Christians in Sudan Sudan's Christians were persecuted under various military regimes. Sudan's civil wars temporarily ended in 1972, but resumed in 1983, as famine hit the region. Four million people were displaced and two million people died in the two-decade long conflict before a temporary six- year ceasefire was signed in January 2005. On 16 May 1983, Sudan's Anglican and Roman Catholic clergy signed a declaration that they would not abandon God as God had revealed himself to them under threat of Shariah Law. Anti- Christian persecutions grew particularly after 1985, including murders of pastors and church leaders, destruction of Christian villages, as well as churches, hospitals, schools and mission bases, and bombing of Sunday church services. Lands laid waste and where all buildings were demolished included an area the size of Alaska. Despite the persecutions, Sudanese Christians increased in number from 1.6 million in 1980 to 11 million in 2010, although 22 of the 24 Anglican dioceses operate in exile in Kenya and Uganda, and clergy are unpaid. Four million people remain internally displaced, and another million in the Sudanese diaspora abroad (of which 400,000 - 600,000 in the South Sudanese diaspora). In 2011, South Sudan voted to secede from the north, effective 9 July. Persecution of Christians there had resumed by then. The Episcopal Church recognizes the martyrs of Sudan on its liturgical calendar on 16 May. The Naivasha Agreement also technically protects non- Muslims in the north. However, some interpretations of Muslim law in Sudan refuse to recognize conversions out of Islam (considering apostacy a crime), and also refuse to recognize marriages to non-Muslims. Sudan is one of the nations where being a Christian is hardest in the world, freedom of religion and belief are systematically violated.Christian in Sudan sentenced to death for faith; 'I'm just praying,' husband says In 2014, there was controversy over the planned execution of Maryam Yaḥyā Ibrahīm Isḥaq for apostasy.

Purpose  The primary purpose of a WIPS is to prevent unauthorized network access to local area networks and other information assets by wireless devices. These systems are typically implemented as an overlay to an existing Wireless LAN infrastructure, although they may be deployed standalone to enforce no-wireless policies within an organization. Some advanced wireless infrastructure has integrated WIPS capabilities. Large organizations with many employees are particularly vulnerable to security breaches caused by rogue access points. If an employee (trusted entity) in a location brings in an easily available wireless router, the entire network can be exposed to anyone within range of the signals. In July 2009, the PCI Security Standards Council published wireless guidelines for PCI DSS recommending the use of WIPS to automate wireless scanning for large organizations.  Intrusion detection  A wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) monitors the radio spectrum for the presence of unauthorized, rogue access points and the use of wireless attack tools. The system monitors the radio spectrum used by wireless LANs, and immediately alerts a systems administrator whenever a rogue access point is detected. Conventionally it is achieved by comparing the MAC address of the participating wireless devices. Rogue devices can spoof MAC address of an authorized network device as their own. New research uses fingerprinting approach to weed out devices with spoofed MAC addresses. The idea is to compare the unique signatures exhibited by the signals emitted by each wireless device against the known signatures of pre-authorized, known wireless devices.  Intrusion prevention  In addition to intrusion detection, a WIPS also includes features that prevent against the threat automatically. For automatic prevention, it is required that the WIPS is able to accurately detect and automatically classify a threat. The following types of threats can be prevented by a good WIPS: * Rogue access points – WIPS should understand the difference between rogue APs and external (neighbor's) APs * Mis-configured AP * Client mis-association * Unauthorized association * Man-in-the-middle attack * Ad hoc networks * MAC spoofing * Honeypot / evil twin attack * Denial-of-service attack  Implementation  WIPS configurations consist of three components: *Sensors -- These devices contain antennas and radios that scan the wireless spectrum for packets and are installed throughout areas to be protected *Server -- The WIPS server centrally analyzes packets captured by sensors *Console -- The console provides the primary user interface into the system for administration and reporting A simple intrusion detection system can be a single computer, connected to a wireless signal processing device, and antennas placed throughout the facility. For huge organizations, a Multi Network Controller provides central control of multiple WIPS servers, while for SOHO or SMB customers, all the functionality of WIPS is available in single box. In a WIPS implementation, users first define the operating wireless policies in the WIPS. The WIPS sensors then analyze the traffic in the air and send this information to WIPS server. The WIPS server correlates the information, validates it against the defined policies, and classifies if it is a threat. The administrator of the WIPS is then notified of the threat, or, if a policy has been set accordingly, the WIPS takes automatic protection measures. WIPS is configured as either a network implementation or a hosted implementation.  Network implementation  In a network WIPS implementation, server, sensors and the console are all placed inside a private network and are not accessible from the Internet. Sensors communicate with the server over a private network using a private port. Since the server resides on the private network, users can access the console only from within the private network. A network implementation is suitable for organizations where all locations are within the private network.  Hosted implementation  In a hosted WIPS implementation, sensors are installed inside a private network. However, the server is hosted in secure data center and is accessible on the Internet. Users can access the WIPS console from anywhere on the Internet. A hosted WIPS implementation is as secure as a network implementation because the data flow is encrypted between sensors and server, as well as between server and console. A hosted WIPS implementation requires very little configuration because the sensors are programmed to automatically look for the server on the Internet over a secure TLS connection. For a large organization with locations that are not a part of a private network, a hosted WIPS implementation simplifies deployment significantly because sensors connect to the Server over the Internet without requiring any special configuration. Additionally, the Console can be accessed securely from anywhere on the Internet. Hosted WIPS implementations are available in an on-demand, subscription-based software as a service model. Hosted implementations may be appropriate for organizations looking to fulfill the minimum scanning requirements of PCI DSS.

History Jukskei is believed to have originated around 1743 in the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa,Jukskei SA developed by \\"transport riders\\" who traveled with ox-drawn wagons.Pétanque SA - Jukskei They used the wooden pins of the yokes (yoke divider: skei}}) of the oxen to throw at a stick that was planted into the ground. The game was also played during the Great Trek.Pillar of Smoke by Day: Chapter 6 of 'The Great Trek' It was also played by the farmers from the Boland on beaches. Jukskei became an organized sport around the year 1939, when the first unions were established and rules were formalized. Today The sport is traditionally associated with the Afrikaners and in 2001 it was chosen by the SA government as one of the sports to be included in the Indigenous Games Project. Since then the game has started to gain popularity with young people of all cultures.Paarl Post There is usually a team of 4 players, of whom one is the captain, but it can also be played in pairs or singles. Jukskei in South Africa is played at schools, club and provincial level, and there is an annual tournament in Kroonstad in the Free State.RSA-Overseas - 1st South Africa Indigenous Games Jukskei is also being played in Namibia and the USA. The three countries are affiliated to the International Jukskei Federation (IJF).  Basic rules  Dimensions of a Jukskei field - distances given to closest pin; 9m between pins The object of the game is to knock over a peg that is planted in a sandpit over a distance of between 11 and 16 m (depending on age and gender). It is played in teams with usually four members each. Each member has two skeis (and thus two turns). The playing field consists of two pits juxtaposed in opposite directions, so that play can take place in both directions. Each time a team member knocks over the peg, he gets three points. If the peg wasn’t knocked out, the team lying closest to the position of the peg, scores as many points as they have skeis closer to the peg than their opponent's closest skei. The first team to get exactly 23 points first wins the game. If the team gets more than 23 points, they start from 0.

Architectural features of the building include sash-style windows, pavilions, a balustrade, a hipped roof, and large dome. It was designed by the architect James Gandon in 1790 for John Dawson, the first Earl of Portarlington. It is one of the few houses to have been designed by Gandon. Other buildings by Gandon include the Custom House and Kings Inns in Dublin. While construction commenced in the 1790s, the first Earl died in 1798, and work was not completed until the tenure of the third Earl of Portalington in the 1860s. Passing through several owners through the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the house and gardens were taken into ownership by the Irish state in the 1990s. Now managed by the Office of Public Works, the estate is open to visitors. History Eighteenth and nineteenth century construction When the first Earl of Portarlington (John Dawson, 1744–1798) died in 1798, his new house was under construction – but far from finished. The second of Portarlington (also John Dawson, 1781–1845) employed new architects to continue the work. The building became habitable during his lifetime. However, when he died 47 years later, the main building was still unfinished, and in the aftermath of the Great Famine (1845–1852), came near to being sold. By the 1860s, the third Earl of Portarlington (Henry Dawson-Damer, 1822–1889) succeeded in bringing Emo Court to a state closely resembling that which stands today. Some elements of the basic structure are faithful to the original plans of James Gandon. However, while Gandon was involved in the first twenty years of its building, given how long the building was in development, little more than his name can be connected with the house which finally came into being. Early twentieth century decline Emo Court was in its heyday in the final forty years of the nineteenth century. However, after the outbreak of World War I in 1914, and, two years later, the Easter Rising and subsequent War of Independence, the Earls of Portarlington, like many Protestants and most of the Anglo-Irish nobility and gentry, left what would become the Irish Free State permanently, and the house was shut up. In 1920, the estate, which extended over nearly , was sold to the Irish Land Commission. The house remained unoccupied, while most of the land was distributed to local farmers. Jesuits at Emo In 1930 the house was acquired by the Jesuits, with the house and 280 acres purchased for £2000. The deeds were signed on 19 February 1930, and Emo Court became known as St Mary's, Emo. The house was opened as the Novitiate of the Irish Province on 4 August 1930, and novices transferred from St Stanislaus' College, Tullamore. There were 52 novices that year. One of the first Jesuit priests to live there was noted photographer Father Francis Browne. As landlords, the Jesuits turned the grounds into a productive farm and orchard and used part of them for playing fields. Some major changes were made in the interior, to provide a chapel and assembly room. In the 1960s, it became apparent that St Mary's Emo was too isolated for the more modern ideas about training novices for work with the Society. In the late 1960s, the number of Novices had diminished, so that in the final years at St Mary's Emo, there were 15 Novices remaining. This meant that it was expensive to run the house for so few men, even with visitors coming to stay for various reasons. Over 500 young men had begun their lives as Jesuits at Emo. In September 1969, the Jesuits left Emo for Manresa House, Dollymount, North Dublin. Major Cholmeley Harrison to present A new chapter began for Emo Court when the Jesuits sold the property to Major Cholmeley Harrison in 1969. Cholmeley Harrison commissioned the London architect Sir Albert Richardson, a leading authority on Georgian architecture, to take on the restoration of the house. While the house remained a private residence, the public were encouraged to enjoy the gardens every Sunday for a fee. The final phase began in 1994 when Cholmeley Harrison presented Emo Court to the President of Ireland, Mary Robinson, who received it on behalf of the people of Ireland. Cholmeley Harrison continued to live there in private apartments until his death, aged 99 in July 2008. Staff of the Office of Public Works (OPW) now care for the estate. House and gardens today Beech wood in Emo Court The approach to Emo Court is through a gateway, and along a driveway which runs for some distance through a beech wood before opening up to an avenue lined by giant sequoias. These large trees were first introduced in 1853 and named Wellingtonias in honour of Arthur Wellesley, first Duke of Wellington, who died the previous year. There is a visitor car park to the side of the house. To the left are coach houses and servants' quarters, to the right mature trees and in the centre the entrance front, dominated by a pediment supported by four Ionic pillars. The Earl's coat of arms fills the pediment and, to left and right, are eighteenth-century friezes depicting agriculture and the arts. Inside the house, an octagonal entrance hall has doors in each of its four angles. Two of them really are entrances to other rooms. The others to give a balanced effect. A larger doorway leads to the rotunda (inspired by the Pantheon), a key feature of the mansion and also the way into two of the major rooms and out to the garden.

Close up of a Tibetan cherry tree in Emo Court Gardens The gardens at Emo are 35 hectares of landscaped grounds, with formal areas, woodland walks, statues and a 20-acre lake – a feature of neoclassical landscape design. Many of the original statues were found in the waters of the lake and it is suspected they found their way there during the time the Jesuits were living in the property, who wanted to hide pagan nudity of figures, where they survived until their eventual discovery and restoration. The gardens are divided into two main areas. The Clucker, which contains some rare specimen trees and glades of azaleas, rhododendrons, camellias and other shrubs. The Grapery is an arboretum though which wind a series of pathways, several pening to views of the surrounding Slieve Bloom Mountains or towards the house.

It stars James Woods, Louis Gossett, Jr., Bruce Dern, Heather Graham, Oliver Platt and Randall \\"Tex\\" Cobb. Plot Gabriel Caine (James Woods), a con man, is released from prison in Winfield, Georgia and immediately gets to work on his next scam. Caine and his partner, Fitz (Oliver Platt), travel to a small town not far from the prison: Diggstown, a city obsessed with boxing. A mean-spirited man named John Gillon (Bruce Dern) owns almost all of Diggstown. He is feared by many but also respected because he is the former manager of Diggstown's pride and joy, the once-famous boxer Charles Macom Diggs, the man for whom the town is named. Upon hearing a remark that Diggs once knocked out five fighters in one day, Fitz “drunkenly” says he knows of a fighter who could knock out any 10 in one day: Honey Roy Palmer. Gillon tries to take advantage of the situation and bets Fitz $100,000 that no one man can best ten Diggstown boxers in one day. Caine quickly volunteers to finance Fitz's bet and the con is on. Caine seeks out an old buddy, Palmer (Louis Gossett Jr.), who is now a 48-year-old YMCA supervisor. After some initial reluctance, Palmer agrees to participate and starts to train for the fight. Caine and Gillon agree to various conditions of the bet, with “one day” being 24 full hours and “Diggstown fighters” being able to come from any surrounding area of Olivair County. A loan shark backs Caine's bet, with the understanding that his health and welfare will be riding on the outcome. Caine discovers that Gillon's treachery (and his bank account) goes deeper than Diggstown people know. As his manager, Gillon drugged Diggs during a fight so that Gillon could collect on the opponent's long odds. Diggs suffered irreversible brain damage as a result. With help from his prison buddy Wolf's sister (Heather Graham), it is learned that Gillon has more than $1.5 million in assets. Caine tricks him into risking all of it. Now it is up to Honey Roy Palmer to defeat all 10 of Diggstown's men. They begin with: * Buck Holland (played by former heavyweight boxing contender Rocky Pepeli), who puts up a good fight. Palmer barely beats him. * Slim Busby, who like his brother, Hambone, has been bribed by Caine to take a dive. * Billy Hargrove (played by James Caviezel), who is easily beat. * Sam Lester (played by Roger Hewlett), who is secretly given a laxative before the fight and eventually runs from the ring. * Hambone Busby, who, like his brother, has been bribed to take a dive. Gillon, however, threatens to kill Hambone's brother, Slim, unless he is victorious in the ring. Hambone fights a vicious fight, but is ultimately defeated. Slim is indeed found murdered. Palmer is enraged. His next fight is with Sonny Hawkins, who is easily dispatched. Robby Gillon, the son of John Gillon, approaches the ring next, but then backs out under instructions from his father. His cowardice is regarded as a forfeit. Frank Mangrum officially loses to disqualification after kicking Palmer in the groin, then hitting the referee then gets knocked out by Palmer. Tank Miller, a gargantuan fighter, is next. He puts up a good fight, but a tiring Palmer eventually beats him. That brings up Diggstown's best man, Hammerhead Hagan, the only fighter ever to actually beat Palmer during their professional careers. He is brought in as a surprise ringer. Gillon moved him in as a county resident just before the bet rules were established, meaning that Hagan can legally fight. The bout is one-sided. Palmer looks done for, but he gets new motivation after seeing Diggs, who is sitting courtside, move his hand slightly (which he interprets as a show of support). Caine, not wanting to see his friend die, attempts to throw in the towel, but Palmer catches it and throws it back. Palmer rallies to knock out his opponent. Palmer, Caine and Fitz begin their celebration of this miraculous feat. They are cut short by Gillon, who notes that his son never entered the ring -– therefore, only nine fights have transpired. The true tenth fighter is then introduced: Minoso Torres, a tough-as-nails boxer who ruled the boxing underground in the prison from which Caine was recently released. No one has ever defeated him. Gillon admonishes Caine with: \\"Never try to hustle a hustler.\\" An exhausted Palmer is no match for Torres. But just when all looks lost, Caine whistles at Torres, gets his attention, straightens his tie and does a thumbs-down gesture (copying a move Gillon did earlier). Torres drops his gloves and invites Palmer to hit him, hitting the canvas, knocked out. Caine was expecting such a trick from Gillon and bribed Torres long ago for a moment like this. Gillon has lost everything, leading Caine to correct him with an admonishment: \\"Actually, I believe it goes: Never con a con-man, especially one who's better than you are.\\" Calm at first, he snaps and pulls a gun. His son, Robby, tries to intervene and Gillon smacks him. Palmer then grabs Gillon and prepares to deck him. Instead, he turns to Hambone, claiming, \\"My hands hurt.\\" Hambone gladly obliges and delivers Gillon a powerful knockout blow. Caine congratulates Palmer: \\"What you did,\\" he says, \\"couldn't be done.\\" To which Palmer replies, \\"Now, you motivate me\\".

Oorlam clans were originally formed from mixed-race descendants of indigenous Khoikhoi, Europeans and slaves from Mozambique, Madagascar, India, and Indonesia. Similar to the other Afrikaans-speaking group at the time, the Trekboers, Oorlam originally populated the frontiers of the infant Cape Colony, later living as semi- nomadic commandos of mounted gunmen. Also like the Boers, they migrated inland from the Cape, and established several states in what are now South Africa and Namibia. The Oorlam migration in South Africa also produced the related Griqua people. History Mixed-race \\"Afrikander\\" Trekboer nomads in the Cape Colony, ancestral people to the Oorlam and Griqua migrations. Beginning in the late 18th century, Oorlam communities migrated from the Cape Colony north to Namaqualand. They settled places earlier occupied by the Nama. They came partly to escape Dutch colonial conscription, partly to raid and trade, and partly to obtain herding lands.J. D. Omer-Cooper, History of Southern Africa (Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann, 1987), 263; Nigel Penn, \\"Drosters of the Bokkeveld and the Roggeveld, 1770–1800,\\" in Slavery in South Africa: Captive Labor on the Dutch Frontier, ed. Elizabeth A. Eldredge and Fred Morton (Boulder, CO: Westview, 1994), 42; Martin Legassick, \\"The Northern Frontier to ca. 1840: The rise and decline of the Griqua people,\\" in The Shaping of South African Society, 1652–1840, ed. Richard Elphick & Hermann Giliomee (Middletown, Connecticut: Wesleyan U. Press, 1988), 373–74. Some of these emigrant Oorlams (including the band led by the outlaw Jager Afrikaner and his son Jonker Afrikaner in the Transgariep) retained links to Oorlam communities in or close to the borders of the Cape Colony. In the face of gradual Boer expansion and then large-scale Boer migrations away from British rule at the Cape, Jonker Afrikaner brought his people into Namaqualand by the mid-19th century, becoming a formidable force for Oorlam domination over the Nama and against the Bantu-speaking Hereros for a period.Omer-Cooper, 263-64. Emerging from populations of Khoikhoi servants raised on Boer farms, many of them having been orphaned and captured in Dutch commando raids, Oorlams primarily spoke a version of Dutch or proto-Afrikaans and were much influenced by Cape Dutch colonial ways of life, including adoption of horses and guns, European clothing, and Christianity.Legassick, 368-69; Penn, 42. However, after two centuries of assimilation into the Nama culture, many Oorlams today regard Khoikhoigowab (Damara/Nama) as their mother tongue. The distinction between Namas and Oorlams has gradually disappeared, so that today they are regarded as a single ethnic group, despite their different origins. Clans The Orlam people comprise various subtribes, clans, and families. In South Africa the Griqua are an influential Oorlam group. The clans that migrated across the Oranje into South West Africa are, in order of their time of arrival: * The ǀAixaǀaen (Orlam Afrikaners), the first group to enter and permanently settle in Namibia. Their leader Klaas Afrikaner left the Cape Colony around 1770. The clan first built the fortress of ǁKhauxaǃnas, then moved to Blydeverwacht, and finally settled at Windhoek. * The ǃAman (Bethanie Orlam) subtribe settled at Bethanie at the turn of the eighteenth century. * The Kaiǀkhauan (Khauas Nama) subtribe formed in the 1830s, when the Vlermuis clan merged with the Amraal family. Their home settlement became Naosanabis (now Leonardville), which they occupied from 1840 onward. This clan ceased to exist after military defeat by Imperial German Schutztruppe in 1894 and 1896. * The ǀHaiǀkhauan (Berseba Orlam) subtribe formed in 1850, when the Tibot and Goliath families split from the ǃAman to found Berseba. * The ǀKhowesin (Witbooi Orlam) subtribe was the last to take up settlement in Namibia. They originated at Pella, south of the Orange River. Their home town became Gibeon.

In 1968 he secured a remarkable provincial double, winning Harty Cup and Corn Uí Mhuirí medals following respective defeats of CBS Sexton Street and Coláiste Íosagáin. After a defeat by St. Peter's College in the subsequent Croke Cup decider, O'Doherty won a Hogan Cup medal following a 3–11 to 1–10 defeat of Belcamp College. Two years later O'Doherty won a second Corn Uí Mhuirí medal following another defeat of Coláiste Íosagáin. He later added a second Hogan Cup medal to his collection following a narrow 4–5 to 1–13 defeat of St. Malachy's from Belfast.

In 1978 he was at full-back as UCC faced University College Dublin in the final of the Fitzgibbon Cup. A 3–15 to 2–7 defeat was the result on that occasion. Club O'Doherty enjoyed little success with Glen Rovers in the minor and under-21 grades, however, by 1972 he was a key member of the senior team. He won his first championship medal that year following a 3–15 to 1–10 of first-time finalists Youghal. A subsequent 2–9 to 1–10 defeat of former champions Roscrea gave O'Doherty a first Munster medal. On 9 December 1973 O'Doherty lined out in the All-Ireland decider against St. Rynagh's. Tom Buckley and Red Crowley inspired the Glen to a 2–18 to 2–8 victory, giving O'Doherty his first All-Ireland medal.

He was a late addition to the starting fifteen, making his debut in the All-Ireland decider against Sligo on 22 September 1968. A narrow 3–5 to 1–10 victory gave O'Doherty an All-Ireland Minor Football Championship medal. In 1969 O'Doherty was a dual player in the minor grade. He added a second Munster medal to his collection, as the footballers defeated Kerry by 3–11 to 0–12. A week later O'Doherty won his first Munster medal with the hurlers as Tipperary were accounted for on a score line of 1–12 to 2–4. On 7 September 1969 Cork faced Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider.

John Rothwell ran riot and scored four goals as Cork powered to a 7–8 to 1–11 victory. It was his first All-Ireland medal with the under-21s on the field of play. A week later Cork faced Fermanagh for the second successive year in the All-Ireland football decider. A 3–10 to 0–3 trouncing gave O'Doherty a second All-Ireland medal in that code. 1971 also saw Doherty link up with the Cork junior football team. A 2–7 to 1–5 defeat of Clare gave him a Munster medal. The following year O'Doherty missed the Cork junior footballers provincial campaign, however, he was at left corner-back for the All-Ireland decider against Hertfordshire on 1 October 1972. A 5–16 to 0–3 thrashing gave him an All-Ireland medal. In 1973 O'Doherty was captain of the under-21 hurling side. After missing the provincial decider he was back on the starting fifteen for the All-Ireland decider against Wexford on 11 November 1973. A 2–10 to 4–2 victory gave O'Doherty a second All-Ireland medal on the field of play, his third over all, while he also had the honour of collecting the cup. Senior O'Doherty made his senior championship debut on 4 July 1971 in a 2–16 to 2–14 Munster semi-final defeat by Limerick.

He won a National Hurling League medal the following year after a 6–15 to 1–12 trouncing of Limerick. O'Doherty won his first Munster medal in 1975 following a 3–14 to 0–12 defeat of Limerick. 1976 saw Cork retain their provincial title with another huge 4–14 to 3–5 win over neighbouring Limerick. It was O'Doherty's second Munster medal. Wexford provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 5 September 1976. Wexford got off to a great start and were 2–2 to no score ahead after just six minutes. Wexford had a two-point lead with ten minutes to go, however, three points from Jimmy Barry-Murphy, two from Pat Moylan and a kicked effort from Ray Cummins gave Cork a 2–21 to 4–11 victory. It was O'Doherty's first All-Ireland medal. O'Doherty was appointed captain of the team in 1977. He won a third successive Munster medal that year following a 4–15 to 4–10 defeat of fourteen-man Clare. The All-Ireland final on 4 September 1977 was a repeat of the previous year, with Wexford providing the opposition once again. Seánie O'Leary score the decisive goal for Cork as the game entered the last quarter, while Martin Coleman brought off a match- winning save from Christy Keogh to foil the Wexford comeback. A 1–17 to 3–8 victory gave O'Doherty a second All-Ireland medal, while he also had the honour of lifting the Liam MacCarthy Cup. He was later presented with his first All-Star. Cork made it a fourth successive provincial title in 1978, with O'Doherty also collecting his fourth winners' medal following a narrow 0–13 to 0–11 defeat of Clare. On 3 September 1978 Cork faced Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider. Cork went on to secure a first three-in-a-row of All- Ireland titles for the first time in over twenty years, as a Jimmy Barry- Murphy goal helped the team to a 1–15 to 2–8 victory over Kilkenny. It was O'Doherty's third successive All-Ireland medal, while he later secured a second All-Star. Cork and O'Doherty won a record-equaling fifth successive Munster title in 1979 following a 2–15 to 0–9 trouncing of Limerick. Cork's quest for a fourth successive All-Ireland title ended with a semi-final defeat by Galway, however, O'Doherty was later presented with a third successive All- Star. After emigrating to Los Angeles O'Doherty missed Cork's championship campaign in 1981. He was back the following year as Cork powered their way through the championship. A massive 5–21 to 3–6 defeat of Waterford in the provincial decider gave him a sixth Munster medal. On 5 September 1982 Cork faced Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider. \\"The Cats\\", who many viewed as the underdogs, surprised all on the day, with Christy Heffernan scoring two goals in a forty-second spell just before the interval to take the wind out of Cork's sails. Ger Fennelly got a third goal within eight minutes of the restart, giving Kilkenny a 3–18 to 1–15 victory. O'Doherty retired from inter- county hurling following this defeat.

He was signed by the Arizona Cardinals as an undrafted free agent in 2008. He played college football at Penn State. Morelli was a member of the San Jose SaberCats, Milwaukee Iron, Omaha Nighthawks and Pittsburgh Power. Early years As a 10-year-old, Morelli won the National Football League's 1995 Punt, Pass, and Kick competition, throwing a 50-yard pass in front of his hometown crowd at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium. In his high school years, Morelli was selected to the ESPN RISE Elite 11.ESPN RISE Elite 11#2003 College career Morelli originally committed to the University of Pittsburgh in August 2003, but de-committed due to Pitt's existing situation with Tyler Palko, along with the recent move of Miami, Virginia Tech, and Boston College out of the Big East, and chose Penn State instead. Morelli's junior year at Penn State got off to a good start. He threw a 42-yard touchdown on his first pass as the Nittany Lion's starting quarterback in a 34-16 win over the University of Akron. However, he struggled after that, particularly in a 28-6 loss to rival Ohio State. With the Lions down 14-6, Morelli threw two late interceptions that Ohio State returned for touchdowns, effectively ending any hopes of a comeback and making the game look a lot more lopsided than it was. Morelli finished the game with only 106 yards passing. As a result of this performance, Morelli's play had become a polarizing issue amongst Nittany Lion fans. Some fans wanted to bring in backup Daryll Clark, a redshirt freshman whose style of play resembles that of Morelli's predecessor and former Heisman hopeful, Michael Robinson. Other fans have come to Morelli's defense, pointing out the amount of playing time typically required to develop good quarterbacks. By season's end, Morelli had thrown for 2,424 yards, 11 touchdowns and 8 interceptions. He took over third place on Penn State's season passing yardage list, trailing only Kerry Collins (1994) and Tony Sacca (1991). Despite his relatively decent statistics, Morelli expressed frustration over the conservative nature of Penn State's play calling in a November 2006 interview with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.Morelli facing high expectations - Pittsburgh Tribune-Review After struggling all season, Morelli was able to redeem himself during the 2007 Outback Bowl against Tennessee, leading the Nittany Lions to an upset victory. Morelli's senior season began with a dominant victory over rival Notre Dame but quickly lost momentum with ineffectual campaigns at rival Michigan and at Illinois highlighted by his tendency to turn the ball over in critical situations. Morelli then led Penn State to blowout wins over Iowa and Wisconsin and a close road win against Indiana, but Morelli struggled against rival Ohio State and was unable to rally Penn State to victory over Big Ten rival Michigan State in the closing minutes of the game. Controversy Morelli revealed that he has not spoken with high school coach Neil Gordon since his final game in 2003. He accused Gordon and his staff of sabotaging his college recruitment, spreading rumors about his intelligence and his inability to read defenses. Professional career Arizona Cardinals Morelli was signed by the Cardinals as an undrafted free agent immediately following the 2008 NFL Draft. In his first professional appearance, Morelli went 2-6 for 13 yards against the New Orleans Saints in Arizona's 2008 preseason opener. He was cut on August 30, 2008, after a lackluster performance in week 4 of the preseason against the Denver Broncos, which included an interception returned for a touchdown. Morelli worked out for the Green Bay Packers and Buffalo Bills during the 2009 offseason. He was also slated to play for the San Jose SaberCats of the Arena Football League (AFL) until they suspended operations indefinitely in August 2009. Milwaukee Iron Morelli signed with the Milwaukee Iron of the new AFL on January 2, 2010. He worked out with NFL teams at the 2010 NFL Combine, in hopes of returning to the NFL. Pittsburgh Power On November 2, 2010, it was announced that Morelli was signed by the expansion AFL team, the Pittsburgh Power. He was signed along with 15 other players after an open tryout held a month prior. Along with the former Penn State quarterback, the Power agreed to terms with his high school teammates, Tyrell Herbert and Kenny Lewis. Morelli was cut by the Power in February 2011. He was re-signed on March 25. He was released again. Personal He was the quarterbacks coach at Plum High School in Pittsburgh, before moving to Indianapolis to train under the coaching of former NFL quarterback, Jack Trudeau.

Freedman. The organization presents contemporary art in New York City's public spaces through a series of highly visible artists' projects, new commissions, installations, and exhibitions that are emblematic of the organization's mission and innovative history. History Public Art Fund was founded in 1977 by Doris C. Freedman who served as the first Director of New York City's Department of Cultural Affairs, the President of the Municipal Art Society, and a tireless supporter of New York City's Percent for Art legislation. Public Art Fund was born from the merger of two preexisting organizations, CityWalls, which was founded in 1966, and the Public Arts Council, founded in 197). Working with artists and museums, Public Art Fund works to bring artwork outside of traditional spaces and into the public sphere. Since its inception, Public Art Fund has presented more than 500 artists' exhibitions and projects at sites throughout New York City's five boroughs as varied as streets, plazas, parks, buses, billboards, and even major landmarks including Times Square, Rockefeller Center, the Brooklyn Bridge Park, Columbus Circle, and Lincoln Center. Susan K. Freedman has served as president since 1986. Nicholas Baume joined Public Art Fund as Director and Chief Curator in 2009 and Jill Kraus has been Chairman of the Board of Directors since 2011.  Public Programs  In addition to presenting works of art, Public Art Fund also hosts additional programs including Public Art Fund Talks. This series encompasses discussions and presentations from today's most influential artist. Another program, In the Public Realm, is an open call which allows emerging artist to conceive and develop innovative ideas for public works. Public Art Fund also releases a semi annual magazine and exhibition catalog which provides its audience with a summary of the organizations activities and achievements. Highlighted Public Projects in New York City Public Art Fund has collaborated with many New York City institutions, including the Whitney Museum of American Art for the Whitney Biennial, Outdoors in Central Park(2002, 2004), and the Museum of Modern Art for Francis Alÿs’ The Modern Procession (2002). Early exhibition highlights include Agnes Denes’ Wheatfields for Manhattan (1982), David Hammons’ Higher Goals (1986), and Messages to the Public (1982–1990), a series of projects created for Times Square’s Spectacolor board that featured work by over 70 artists including Jenny Holzer, Keith Haring, Barbara Kruger, Vito Acconci, Lynne Tillman, Alfredo Jaar, Richard Prince, and the Guerilla Girls. In the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the organization commissioned socially conscious pieces such as Felix Gonzalez-Torres’ “Untitled” billboard (1989), Gran Fury’s “Women don’t get AIDS…they just die from it” poster (1991), Guerilla Girls’ billboard project for Public Art Fund’s PSA: Public Service Art exhibition series (1991), and Barbara Kruger’s Bus (1997). In 1997, Public Art Fund organized Ilya Kabakov's Monument to the Lost Glove, a giant glove made of red plastic resin, which was bolted to the traffic triangle where Fifth Avenueand Broadwaycross at 23rd Street, and worked with him again in 2000 with The Palace of Projects, which was shown at the 69th Regiment Armory. Other New York City projects included Nancy Rubins' Big Pleasure Point (2006) at Lincoln Center; Corner Plot (2006) by Sarah Sze at the Doris C. Freedman Plaza; Alexander Calder in New York at the City Hall Park (2006) ; and Material World (2005) at the MetroTech Commonsion Downtown Brooklyn, which featured new commissions by Rachel Foullon, Corin Hewitt, Matthew Day Jackson, Peter Kreider, and Mamiko Otsubo.

Born in Midleton, County Cork, Mulcahy first played competitive hurling during his schooling at Midleton CBS. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty when he first linked up with the Cork under-21 team. He made his senior debut during the 1980-81 league. Mulcahy subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won two All-Ireland medals, four Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Mulcahy won one Railway Cup medal as a non-playing substitute. At club level he is a one-time All-Ireland medallist with Midleton. In addition to this he has also won two Munster medals and four championship medals. Throughout his career Mulcahy made 24 championship appearances. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1992 championship. Playing career Club After some success at underage levels, culminating in the winning of an East Cork minor championship in 1972, Mulcahy subsequently joined the Midleton intermediate team. In 1978 he enjoyed his first major success when he captured a championship medal in the intermediate grade as Midleton defeated Newtownshandrum by 1-12 to 1-10. Five years later Mulcahy was left corner-back of the Midleton senior team that bridged a forty-five year gap to qualify for the championship decider. The opponents, St. Finbarr's, were appearing in their fifth successive decider and were hoping to secure fourth championship in-a-row. A 1-18 to 2-9 victory gave Midleton their first title since 1916, while Mulcahy collected his first championship medal. He later collected a Munster medal following a 1-14 to 1-11 defeat of Borris-Ileigh in the provincial decider. Two-in-a-row proved beyond Midleton, while the club also lost the decider to Blackrock in 1985. The following year Midleton were back in the decider and Mulcahy collected a second championship medal as the club secured a 1-18 to 1-10 defeat of Blackrock. In 1987 Midleton faced Na Piarsaigh in the championship decider. An exciting 2-12 to 0-15 victory gave Mulcahy a third championship medal. He later won a second Munster medal as Cappawhite were accounted for by 1-12 to 1-11 in the provincial decider. On 17 March 1988 Midleton faced Athenry in the All-Ireland decider and a close game developed. Two early goals by Kevin Hennessy and a kicked goal by Colm O'Neill gave Midleton a 3–8 to 0–9 victory and gave Mulcahy an All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship medal. Mulcahy was in the twilight of his career in 1991 when Midleton reached the championship decider once again. A 1-17 to 1-8 defeat of Glen Rovers gave him his fourth championship medal. Inter-county Mulcahy first played for Cork as a member of the under-21 hurling team on 13 April 1977. He was at full-back on his debut in a 4-12 to 0-7 Munster quarter-final defeat of Clare. He was dropped from the starting fifteen for Cork's subsequent provincial final defeat of Limerick and their All-Ireland defeat by Kilkenny. During the 1980-81 league campaign Mulcahy was included on the Cork senior team. He won a National Hurling League medal that year when he came on as a substitute in Cork's 3-11 to 2-8 defeat of Offaly in the league decider. Mulcahy was later included as a substitute for the championship, however, Cork fell at the first hurdle. Mulcahy made his senior championship debut on 3 June 1984 in a 3-15 to 2-13 Munster semi-final defeat of Limerick. Cork proved to be the dominant force in Munster once again, with Mulcahy winning a first Munster medal following a memorable 4–15 to 3–14 defeat of Tipperary in the provincial showpiece. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 2 September 1984, played at Semple Stadium in Thurles, saw Cork take on Offaly for the first time ever in championship history. The centenary-year final failed to live up to expectations and Cork recorded a relatively easy 3–16 to 1–12 victory. It was Mulcahy's first All-Ireland medal. A week later Mulcahy was at centre-back on the Cork junior football team that faced Warwickshire in the All-Ireland decider. A huge 3-20 to 0-7 victory gave him an All-Ireland Junior Football Championship medal. In 1985 Mulcahy added a second Munster medal to his collection as Cork defeated Tipperary by 4–17 to 4–11 in the provincial decider once again. Cork made it five-in-a-row in Munster in 1986 as they defeated Clare by 2–18 to 3–12 to take the provincial title. It was Mulcahy's third Munster medal. This victory paved the way for an All-Ireland final meeting with Galway on 7 September 1986. The men from the west were the red- hot favourites against a Cork team in decline, however, on the day a different story unfolded. Four Cork goals, one from John Fenton, two from Tomás Mulcahy and one from Kevin Hennessy, stymied the Galway attack and helped the Rebels to a 4–13 to 2–15 victory. It was Mulcahy's second All-Ireland medal while he was later honoured with an All-Star. Tipperary bested Cork over the next two years, with Mulcahy serving as captain in 1988. Waterford beat Cork in the provincial semi-final in 1989 and Mulcahy effectively brought the curtain down on his inter-county career. Mulcahy's impressive display at full-back during Midleton's club championship success in 1991 saw him being recalled to the Cork team in 1992. He later won a fourth Munster medal as Cork defeated Limerick by 1-22 to 3-11. On 6 September 1992 Cork faced Kilkenny in the All- Ireland decider for the first time in a decade. After playing with the wind for the opening half Cork were ahead by two points at the interval. John Power and Michael Phelan added two second-half goals to the one D. J. Carey scored in the first half to give Kilkenny a 3–10 to 1–12 victory. Inter- provincial Mulcahy also had the honour of being selected to play for Munster in the inter-provincial series of games. He played with his province for four seasons from 1985 until 1988, winning just one Railway Cup winners' medal in his first year. Munster defeated Connacht by a single point on that occasion.

Performing marriages  There is a common belief that ship captains have historically been, and currently are, able to perform marriages. This depends on the country of registry, however most do not permit performance of a marriage by the master of a ship at sea. In the United States Navy, a captain's powers are defined by its 1913 Code of Regulations,Art. R 2048; cf. 32 CFR § 700.844 (in force 1999–2019; removed: 84 FR 11413) specifically stating: \\"The commanding officer shall not perform a marriage ceremony on board his ship or aircraft. He shall not permit a marriage ceremony to be performed on board when the ship or aircraft is outside the territory of the United States.\\" However, there may be exceptions \\"in accordance with local laws and the laws of the state, territory, or district in which the parties are domiciled\\" and \\"in the presence of a diplomatic or consular official of the United States, who has consented to issue the certificates and make the returns required by the consular regulations.\\" Furthermore, in the United States, there have been a few contradictory legal precedents: courts did not recognize a shipboard marriage in California's 1898 Norman v. NormanNorman v. Norman, 121 Cal. 620 (Cal. 1898) but did in New York's 1929 Fisher v. FisherFisher v. Fisher, 165 N.E. 460 (N.Y. 1929) (notwithstanding the absence of municipal laws so carried) and in 1933's Johnson v. Baker,Johnson v. Baker, 20 P.2d 407 (Or. 1933) an Oregon court ordered the payment of death benefits to a widow because she had established that her marriage at sea was lawful. However, in Fisher v. Fisher the involvement of the ship's captain was irrelevant to the outcome.Anthony Dickey, \\"Family Law: Marriage on the High Seas\\" in Australian Law Journal, Volume 62, p 717. New Jersey's 1919 Bolmer v. EdsallBolmer v. Edsall, 90 N.J. Eq. 299 (1919) said a shipboard marriage ceremony is governed by the laws of the nation where ownership of the vessel lies. In the United Kingdom, the captain of a merchant ship has never been permitted to perform marriages, although from 1854 any which took place had to be reported in the ship's log.BT 334/117, Register of marriages at sea (1854-1972), UK Board of Trade, archived at The National Archives, Kew lists 219 marriages recorded in ship's logbooks, most performed at sea by chaplains or ministers of religion; their legal status nonetheless remains uncertain. SpanishSpain: Civil Code, Art. 52 and FilipinoPhilippines: Family Code (1987), Art. 31 (formerly Civil Code, Art. 74; cf. Supreme Court of the Philippines, G.R. No. 158298) law, as narrow exceptions, recognise a marriage in articulo mortis (on the point of death) solemnized by the captain of a ship or chief of an aeroplane during a voyage, or by the commanding officer of a military unit. Japan allows ship captains to perform a marriage ceremony at sea, but only for Japanese citizens. Malta,Malta: Marriage Act 1975 BermudaBermuda: Maritime Marriage Act 1999 and the BahamasThe Bahamas: Maritime Marriage Act, 2011 permit captains of ships registered in their jurisdictions to perform marriages at sea. Princess Cruises, whose ships are registered in Bermuda, has used this as a selling point for their cruises, while Cunard moved the registration of its ships Queen Mary 2, Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth from Southampton to Bermuda in 2011 to allow marriages to be conducted on their ships. Some captains obtain other credentials (such as ordination as ministers of religion or accreditation as notaries public), which allow them to perform marriages in some jurisdictions where they would otherwise not be permitted to do so. Another possibility is a wedding on a ship in port, under the authority of an official from that port. In works of fiction, ship captains have performed marriages in various media, including the 1951 film The African Queen, and episodes of The Love Boat, How I Met Your Mother, The Office (U.S. TV series) and various Star Trek series. Licensing United States A ship's captain must have a number of qualifications, including a license. To become a master of vessels of any gross tons upon oceans in the United States, one must first accumulate at least 360 days of service (Recency – 90 days in the past three years on vessels of appropriate tonnage) while holding a chief mate's license. The chief mate's license, in turn, requires at least 360 days of service (Recency – 90 days in the past three years on vessels of appropriate tonnage) while holding a second mate's license, passing a battery of examinations, and approximately 13 weeks of classes. Similarly, one must have worked as a third mate for 360 days (Recency – 90 days in the past three years on vessels of appropriate tonnage) to have become a second mate. There are two methods to attain an unlimited third mate's license in the United States: to attend a specialized training institution, or to accumulate \\"sea time\\" and take a series of training classes and examinations. Training institutions that can lead to a third mate's license include the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (deck curriculum), and the six state maritime academies in Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Texas, or California or the Great Lakes Maritime Academy, or a three-year apprentice mate training program approved by the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard. Furthermore, third mate's licenses can be obtained through the U.S. Coast Guard Academy and the U.S. Naval Academy with approved courses and requisite sea time as an Officer in Charge of a Navigational Watch. A seaman may start the process of obtaining a license after three years of service in the deck department on ocean steam or motor vessels, at least six months of which as able seaman, boatswain, or quartermaster. Then the seaman takes required training courses, and completes on-board assessments. Finally, the mariner can apply to the United States Coast Guard for a third mate's license. An alternate method of obtaining a license as a master of vessels of any gross tons upon oceans, without sailing as a third, second, or chief mate, is to obtain one year of sea service as a 1st class pilot of any gross tons or mate of vessels of any gross tons upon Great Lakes and inland waters. Then pass an examination for the license of master of vessels of any gross tons upon Great Lakes and inland waters. A master of vessels of any gross tons upon Great Lakes and inland waters may, without any additional sea service, take the examination for master of vessels of any gross tons upon near coastal waters. If the candidate does not already have sufficient deep sea experience he may with six months of additional sea service, in any licensed capacity, take a partial examination consisting primarily of celestial navigation and have the near coastal restriction removed. 46CFR 11.403 A master of 1,600 ton vessels can, under certain circumstances, begin the application process for an unlimited third mate's license. Some employers offer financial assistance to pay for the training for their employees. Otherwise, the mariner is responsible for the cost of the required training. A Chief Mate to Master formal training generally takes about 12 weeks and provides the knowledge, skills and other soft skills training to take on the duties and responsibilities. Various US states require and issue shipmaster or captain licenses in order to be employed in operating a vessel for hire, while navigating within \\"non-federal\\" waters. (Such as a lake or river charter boat \\"skipper\\"). Most states honor a USCG master's certificate as an alternative to their state licensing. These state licenses certify that the captain has given satisfactory evidence that they can safely be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities of operating or navigating passenger carrying vessels of the tonnage and upon the waters specified. The state licensed captains command vessels that range from small uninspected vessels to large excursion vessels that carry over 100 passengers, so the licenses are not issued haphazardly. For example, see Washington State's Certification of Charter Boats and Operators licenses. Employment United Kingdom As of 2008, the U.K. Learning and Skills Council lists annual salaries for senior deck officers as ranging from £22,000 to over £50,000 per year.Learning and Skills Council, 2008. The Council characterizes job opportunities for senior deck officers as \\"generally good\\" and expects a \\"considerable increase\\" in the job market over the next few years. United States As of 2013, captains of U.S.-flagged deep sea vessels make up to US$1,500 per day, or US$80,000 to US$300,000 per year.Pelletier, 2007, p.160. Captains of smaller vessels in the inland and coastal trade earn between US$350 and US$700 per day, or US$65,000 to $180,000 per year. Captains of large ferries average US$56,794 annually. In 2005, 3,393 mariners held active unlimited master's licenses.Pelletier, 2007, p.45. 87 held near-coastal licenses with unlimited tonnage, 291 held unlimited tonnage master's licenses on inland and Great Lakes waters, while 1,044 held unlimited licenses upon inland waters only. Some 47,163 active masters licenses that year had tonnage restrictions, well over half of those being for near-coastal vessels of up to 100 tons gross tonnage. As of 2006, some 34,000 people were employed as captains, mates, and pilots of water vessels in the United States.Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2008-2009, p. 4. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 18% growth in this occupation, expecting demand for 40,000 shipmasters in 2016. Uniform A captain's insignia that features the executive curl. E J Smith Captains from different Navies Uniforms are worn aboard many ships, or aboard any vessels of traditional and organized navigation companies, and are required by company regulation on passenger and cruise vessels. In the passenger-carrying trade a unified corporate image is often desired and it is useful for those unfamiliar with the vessel to be able to identify members of the crew and their function. Some companies and some countries use an executive curl similar to that of the Royal Navy. In the United States, and in numerous other maritime countries, captains and officers of shipping companies may wear a merchant navy or merchant marine regular uniform in conjunction with their employment. Related terms Master mariner Captain's seniority In a few countries, such as UK, USA and Italy, some captains with particular experience in navigation and command at sea, may be named commodore or senior captain or shipmaster senior grade. Master The term master is descended from the Latin magister navis, used during the imperial Roman age to designate the nobleman (patrician) who was in ultimate authority on board a vessel. The magister navis had the right to wear the laurus or corona laurèa and the corona navalis. Carrying on this tradition, the modern-day shipmaster of some nations wears golden laurel leaves or golden oak leaves on the visor of his cap. Skipper A skipper is a person who has command of a boat or watercraft or tug, more or less equivalent to \\"captain in charge aboard ship.\\" At sea, or upon lakes and rivers, the skipper as shipmaster or captain has command over the whole crew. The skipper may or may not be the owner of the boat. The word is derived from the Dutch word schipper; schip is Dutch for \\"ship\\". In Dutch sch- is pronounced and English-speakers rendered this as . The word \\"skipper\\" is used more than \\"captain\\" for some types of craft, for example fishing boats. It is also more frequently used than captain with privately owned noncommercial or semi-commercial vessels, such as small yachts and other recreational boats, mostly in cases where the person in command of the boat may not be a licensed or professional captain, suggesting the term is less formal. In the U.S., a \\"skipper\\" who is in command of a charter vessel that carries paying passengers must be licensed by a state or the USCG. If the vessel carries over six paying passengers, it must be an \\"inspected vessel\\" and a higher class license must be obtained by the skipper/master depending on the vessel's gross tons. In the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Coast Guard, and merchant naval slang, it is a term used in reference to the commanding officer of any ship, base, or other command regardless of rank. It is generally only applied to someone who has earned the speaker's respect, and only used with the permission of the commander/commanding officer in question. Skipper RNR was an actual rank used in the British Royal Naval Reserve for skippers of fishing boats who were members of the service. It was equivalent to Warrant Officer. Skippers could also be promoted to Chief Skipper RNR (equivalent to Commissioned Warrant Officer) and Skipper Lieutenant RNR.

Around the time he began his career at Channel One News, Chopra changed the spelling of his given name from \\"Gautama\\" to \\"Gotham.\\" Chopra said that he changed the spelling because he was tired of \\"Gautama\\" being mispronounced in the United States. He is a partner in Chopra Media, with his sister, Mallika Chopra. Together they launched IntentBlog and Virgin Comics which he collaborated on with Sir Richard Branson. In September 2008, Gotham and Virgin Comics co-founder Sharad Devarajan led a management buyout of Virgin Comics and renamed the Company, Liquid Comics. Subsequently, Liquid Comics refocused its business on the South Asian subcontinent, launching Graphic India which raised capital from American media baron Peter Chernin. Gotham is also a well regarded documentary filmmaker. In 2012, he directed and produced Decoding Deepak, a feature documentary on his father that premiered at the SXSW film festival. In 2015, Gotham directed and executive produced Kobe Bryant's Muse on NBA superstar Kobe Bryant. The film aired on Showtime Networks and was the highest performing sports documentary in the network's history. Within weeks, another documentary film Gotham directed on Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar entitled The Little Master aired on ESPN as part of the network's award-winning 30 for 30 film series. Later in 2015, Gotham directed and produced I Am Giant, a feature documentary on New York Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz. On July 3, 2009, Chopra gave an interview on CNN's Larry King Live at Neverland Ranch saying that he knew pop star Michael Jackson through his father for over two decades. He had also written about his friendship with Jackson on June 26, 2009 in the Huffington Post. He wrote about Jackson calling him at his dorm when he was a student at Columbia, asking him to help write lyrics for songs and about working with Jackson at his hotel suite in Manhattan as an informal \\"lyrical advisor.\\" He recalled how Jackson called him at night \\"in a panic\\" after he had just married Lisa Marie Presley and asked him if he had any marriage advice. He said he first met Jackson when he was 15 and spent days at the Neverland Ranch with his friends, sisters and cousins. He recalled Jackson's visits to his parents' house and spending a summer with Jackson on the Dangerous Tour. He said their relationship continued after they both became fathers and recalled going to Jackson's house a few years ago with his wife Dr. Candice Chen, a physician, to help when Michael Jackson had an accidental fall. He said parenting was the focus of his last conversations with Jackson in the last few months before Jackson's death.

Over the years it has grown into a large family of hymnals. As such, the Hymns Ancient and Modern set the standard for the current hymnal in the Church of England. Origin Hymn singing By 1830 the regular singing of hymns in the dissenting churches (outside the Church of England) had become widely accepted due to hymn writers like Isaac Watts, Charles Wesley and others. In the Church of England hymn singing was not an integral part of Orders of Service until the early 19th century, and hymns, as opposed to metrical psalms, were not officially sanctioned. From about 1800, parish churches started to use different hymn collections in informal services, like the Lock Hospital Collection (1769) by Martin Madan, the Olney Hymns (1779) by John Newton and William Cowper and A Collection of Hymns for the Use of The People Called Methodists (1779) by John Wesley and Charles Wesley. Oxford Movement A further impetus to hymn singing in the Anglican Church came in the 1830s from the Oxford Movement, led by John Keble and John Henry Newman. Being an ecclesiastical reform movement within the Anglican Church, the Oxford Movement wanted to recover the lost treasures of breviaries and service books of the ancient Greek and Latin churches. As a result Greek, Latin and even German hymns in translation entered the mainstream of English hymnody. These translations were composed by people like John Chandler, John Mason Neale, Thomas Helmore, Edward Caswall, Jane Laurie Borthwick and Catherine Winkworth. Besides stimulating the translation of medieval hymns, and use of plainsong melodies, the Oxford Reformers, inspired by Reginald Heber's work, also began to write original hymns. Among these hymnwriters were clergy like Henry Alford, Henry Williams Baker, Sabine Baring-Gould, John Keble and Christopher Wordsworth and laymen like Matthew Bridges,, William Chatterton Dix and Folliott Sandford Pierpoint. Accomplishment of the Hymns Ancient and Modern William Henry Monk, original editor of the hymnal. The growing popularity of hymns inspired the publication of more than 100 hymnals during the period 1810–1850. The sheer number of these collections prevented any one of them from being successful. A beginning of what would become the Hymns Ancient and Modern was made with the Hymns and Introits (1852), edited by George Cosby White. The idea for the hymn-book arose in 1858 when two clergymen, both part of the Oxford Movement, met on a train: William Denton of St Bartholomew, Cripplegate, co-editor of the Church Hymnal (1853) and Francis Henry Murray, editor of the Hymnal for Use in the English Church Denton suggested that the 1852 Hymnal for use in the English Church by Francis Murray and the Hymns and Introits by George Cosby White should be amalgamated to satisfy the need for standardisation of the hymn books in use throughout England. Besides their idea, Henry Williams Baker and Rev. P. Ward were already engaged on a similar scheme for rival books. Given the lack of unanimity in the church's use of hymns, Henry Williams Baker thought it necessary to compile one book which would command general confidence. After ascertaining by private communications the widespread desire of churchmen for greater uniformity in the use of hymns and of hymnbooks in the services of the Church, Sir Henry Baker, vicar of Monkland in the diocese of Hereford, early in 1858 associated himself for this purpose with about twenty clergymen, including the editors of many existing hymnals, who agreed to give up their several books to try to promote the use of one standard hymn book. In October of that year an advertisement in The Guardian, the High Church newspaper, invited co-operation, and over 200 clergymen responded. In January 1859 the committee set to work under the lead of Henry William Baker. An appeal was made to the clergy and to their publishers to withdraw their individual collections and to support this new combined venture. They founded a board, called the \\"Proprietors\\", which oversaw both the publication of the hymnal and the application of the profits to support appropriate charities, or to subsidise the purchase of the hymn books by poor parishes. The superintendent was William Henry Monk. One of the advisors, John Keble, recommended that it should be made a comprehensive hymn-book. This committee set themselves to produce a hymn-book which would be a companion to the Book of Common Prayer. Another intention of the founders of Hymns Ancient and Modern was that it would improve congregational worship for everybody. A specimen was issued in May 1859. In 1860 a trial edition was published, with the imprimatur of Dr Renn Hampden, Sir Henry Baker's diocesan. The first full edition with tunes, under the musical editorship of Professor W. H. Monk, King's College, London, appeared on March 20, 1861. Sources for the Hymns Ancient and Modern The Hymns Ancient and Modern was a rather eclectic collection of hymns that included a broad series of hymns from different religious traditions, in order to achieve a standard edition. Sources included: * the translations from Greek by John Chandler in his Hymns of the Primitive Church. * the translations from Latin by John Mason Neale in his Hymnal Noted (Novello, Ewer and Company, 1851) and the Accompanying Harmonies to The Hymnal Noted, together with Thomas Helmore, (1852), the Mediaeval Hymns and Sequences, first published in 1851 and the Hymns of the Eastern Church, translated with Notes and an Introduction (1870, first edition appeared in 1865)1865 edition Hymns of the Eastern Church, ccel.org, retrieved 26 December 2014 * the translations from Latin by Edward Caswall in his Lyra Catholica: Containing All the Hymns of the Roman Breviary and Missal (1851) * the translations from German by Catherine Winkworth in her Lyra Germanica, Hymns for the Sundays and chief festivals of the Christian Year, Translated from the German (1855 edition) * the translations from German by Jane Laurie Borthwick in her Hymns from the land of Luther: translated from the German (first edition in 1853) * the churchly hymns from the Oxford Movement. In the Preface of the 1861 edition of the Hymns Ancient and Modern John Keble's The Christian Year: Thoughts in Verse for the Sundays and holidays throughout the year, 1837 (first edition appeared in 1827) was mentioned explicitly. * the hymns from the evangelical stream (dissenters and Methodists); composers included the clergy William Hiley Bathurst, Horatius Bonar, Henry Francis Lyte, John Henry Newman, and lay persons like Sarah Flower Adams, Cecil Frances Alexander, William Henry Havergal, Frances Ridley Havergal and Jane Eliza Leeson. In the Preface of the 1861 edition of the Hymns Ancient and Modern William Henry Havergal's Old Church Psalmody, (1849) was mentioned explicitly. Henry Williams Baker wrote and translated many of the hymns which it contains, and his ability, his profound knowledge of hymnology, and his energetic discharge of the duties of chairman of its committee for twenty years, mainly contributed to its success. Not all the hymns in these sources were already provided with tunes. Therefore, composers like William Henry Monk, the editor of the 1861 edition, John Bacchus Dykes and Frederick Ouseley, John Stainer, Henry Gauntlett and Edmund Hart Turpin provided new hymn tunes. Among these new hymn tunes were Eternal Father, Strong to Save and Praise to the Holiest in the Height(John Bacchus Dykes), Onward Christian Soldiers (Arthur Sullivan) and Abide with Me (William Henry Monk).John Monsell, Hymns Ancient and Modern: De negentiende- eeuwse Engelse gezangindustrie, in: Tim Dowley, Christelijke muziek door de eeuwen heen, 2013, p. 170-171 The Hymns Ancient and Modern was austere in style and conformed to the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. It also established the practice of writing tunes for specific texts and publishing both texts and tunes together rather than in separate collections, which had been the practice until then. Roughly, the hymns were arranged in the order of the Prayer Book. More specifically, there were separate sections grouped according to liturgical criteria: hymns for the daily offices, Sunday, the church year, Holy Communion and other sacraments, and the various feasts. Furthermore, the Hymns Ancient and Modern was the first influential book to attach \\"Amen\\" to every hymn. Impact of the Hymns Ancient and Modern The Hymns Ancient and Modern experienced immediate and overwhelming success, becoming possibly the most popular English hymnal ever published. The music, expressive and tuneful, greatly assisted to its popularity. Total sales in 150 years were over 170 million copies. As such, it set the standard for many later hymnals like the English Hymnal which first appeared in 1906. As such, the English Hymnal is succeeded by the New English Hymnal in 1986. Editions Early editions The first edition, musically supervised by William Henry Monk, was published in 1861 by Novello & Co, with 273 hymns. They also published the 1868 Appendix; but following negotiations, the whole publishing project was placed in the hands of William Clowes and Son later that year. It was revised in 1875 by Monk to produce the second edition, to which Charles Steggall added several supplementary hymns in 1889. In 1904 a \\"new and revised edition\\" was published, edited by Bertram Luard-Selby. After many complaints about the difference between this and its predecessors, Charles Steggall's edition was republished in 1906 as the \\"Complete edition\\". Standard edition In 1916 the \\"old complete edition\\" was republished for the last time, with a second supplement by Sydney Nicholson. In 1922, the \\"standard edition\\" was published, more strongly based on the \\"old complete edition\\" than the less popular \\"new and revised edition\\". This also was edited by Nicholson, who was the musical editor until he died in 1947. Revised edition The New Standard Edition on a stall in Bath Abbey. In 1950 the \\"revised edition\\" was published, with G. H. Knight and J. Dykes Bower having both edited since the death of Nicholson. Many hymns were weeded out from the 1950 edition as the editors wished to make space for more recent compositions and to thin out the over-supplemented previous versions. Bower was Organist at St. Paul's Cathedral, whilst Knight held the same post at Canterbury. New Standard edition In 1975 the proprietors formed a limited company and a registered charity, and in 1983 published the \\"New Standard edition\\": this comprised 333 of the 636 hymns included in A and M Revised (AMR) and the entire 200-hymn contents of 100 Hymns for Today (HHT, 1969) and More Hymns for Today (MHT, 1980). Common Praise In 2000 Hymns Ancient & Modern Ltd, through its subsidiary the Canterbury Press, published a new hymnal, this time called Common Praise. This was printed by William Clowes Ltd. of Suffolk. Sing Praise In September 2010 Canterbury Press and the Royal School of Church Music published Sing Praise, subtitled \\"Hymns and Songs for Refreshing Worship\\", containing 330 recently written hymn, song and short chant compositions. The selection was designed to complement Common Praise in particular, but also other hymn books in current use. Ancient and Modern In March 2013 Canterbury Press published Ancient and Modern, so reverting to the original title without the word \\"Hymns\\", but also subtitled Hymns and Songs for Refreshing Worship, a brand new edition designed for contemporary patterns of worship. It contains 847 items, including some items from Common Praise and Sing Praise, ranging from psalm settings to John L. Bell, Bernadette Farrell, Stuart Townend and others. In 2014 the British organist John Keys completed recordings of organ accompaniments of all the hymns in the book. Publisher In 1989 Hymns Ancient & Modern Ltd. bought Church Times, the Church of England's periodical, and bought SCM Press in 1997. Other imprints include Canterbury Press.

In court, he often comes up against lawyer Joanna Morgan (Redgrave), who becomes his love interest. His friend Trevor (Ford) is an amateur philosopher who owns a mobile burger bar. Additional characters include Ivan Vishnevski (Philip Voss), Harold Cornice (Stephen Moore), Sarah Cornice (Jill Baker) and Jess Taylor (Daniela Denby- Ashe). Creation and production The series was inspired by the brother of producer Miriam Segal and conceived by Stephen Tredre in 1994, who took up screenwriting due to illness. After obtaining funding from Principal Pictures, Segal approached ITV and then the BBC with the programme, who both turned it down. It was then offered to the BBC's regional drama department, BBC Birmingham, and the series was commissioned. After reorganisation within the BBC, the series was announced in 1999 by the corporation's drama head, Mal Young. The first episode was written by Tredre before his death in 1997, with the rest of the series completed by Matthew Bardsley. The series was filmed in London and cost £3 million. Redgrave's marriage to lawyer Tim Owen did not put her off taking the role of lawyer Joanna Morgan, telling Rob Driscoll for the Birmingham Post: \\"I've been dying to play a lawyer for the longest time, precisely because I know that world quite well now. I'm just worried if people spot mistakes, after all this seemingly reliable research!\\" Also speaking ahead of the first broadcast, McGann described his character as having \\"depth\\" and said of the \\"intelligent\\" writing: \\"It will really engage people.

The position of president is ceremonial and Thắng was never a major policymaker or even a member of the Politburo, Vietnam's ruling council. He served as president, initially of North Vietnam from September 2, 1969, and later of a united Vietnam, until his death in 1980. Tôn Đức Thắng was a key Vietnamese nationalist and Communist political figure, was chairman of the National Assembly's Standing Committee 1955-1960 and served as the vice president to Hồ Chí Minh from 1960 to 1969. He died at the age of 91, he was the oldest head of a state with the title \\"president\\" (subsequently surpassed by Hastings Banda).  Early life  Tôn Đức Thắng was born to Tôn Văn Đề and Nguyễn Thị Di on Ông Hô Island along the Mekong River, roughly four kilometres from Long Xuyên, the capital of An Giang Province . From 1897 to 1901, Thắng received his education in Chinese script, history and philosophy from a private tutor in Long Xuyên. This tutor, an anti-colonialist, carried a heavy influence on the early development of Thắng’s political beliefs . Afterwards, he learned French at an elementary school in Long Xuyên. Thắng lived with his parents until 1906, when he moved to Saigon.Giebel, p14. In 1919, in the Black Sea when he was with the French Navy, Thắng claimed to participate in a plot with fellow sailors to turn over the French armored cruiser Waldeck-Rousseau to the enemy Bolshevik revolutionaries. He continued to participate in rebellious activities against the French, was member of Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth Association since 1927; and in 1929, he was imprisoned by the French at Sai Gon, deported to Côn Sơn Prison. He remained there until 1945 and immediately rose again into the public eye. After Hồ Chí Minh’s Viet Minh came into power in August 1945, Thắng became the member Cochinchina Party Committee of CPV, member Administration Resistance Committee of Cochinchina and since 1946, the presiding member of the National Assembly. In 1947, he became a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam. Alternative version of events Christoph Giebel, Associate Professor of International Studies and History at the University of Washington and author of the book, Imagined Ancestries of Vietnamese CommunismImagined Ancestries of Vietnamese Communism: Ton Duc Thang and the Politics of History and Memory, relates the basic outline of the mutiny and determines from his examination of historical evidence, such as ship logs, that Thắng did not participate in a mutiny on a French ship sent to the Black Sea in 1919 to help defeat Bolsheviks, those fabricated story that linked Vietnamese communism with the October Revolution in Russia and recounted across the Communist world in the 1950s. Giebel highlights disagreements over Thắng’s involvement with a Saigon labour union in the 1920s and the naval-yard strike there in 1925.  Years with North Vietnam   Becoming a figure  Thắng also served as president of the Lien Viet during the rebellion against the French from 1946 to 1954. However, the organization was dissolved after the Geneva Convention in 1954 which gave the Viet Minh sole control over North Vietnam. Thắng then took over another organization, the Vietnamese Fatherland Front, a Communist pro-government nationalist group. Thắng led the Fatherland Front in its conquest to draw supporters from South Vietnam. He received the Stalin Peace Award in 1955 as a result. Thắng’s work with trying to win over South Vietnam also helped lead him to becoming the Vice President of North Vietnam under Hồ Chí Minh in 1960. In 1967, when he was still vice president, Thắng won the Lenin Peace Prize, a yearly prize similar to the Nobel Peace Prize, but given out by the Soviet Union. After Hồ Chí Minh's death in 1969, Thắng succeeded him as president. Most of the real power, however, was vested in Communist Party leader Lê Duẩn.  Fall of Saigon  With the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, the pro- Communist Provisional Revolutionary Government took control of the South. This allowed for the future reunification of Vietnam as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, which was formalized on July 2, 1976. Presently, April 30 is recognized as a public holiday in Vietnam known as Reunification Day, even though it was not until July 2 that the two countries became officially united as one nation. Thắng became the first president of the reunified country.  Tôn Đức Thắng as president of Vietnam  With the end of the Vietnam War and with the South Vietnamese government ousted, Thắng was easily able to keep his control over the unstable new nation during the middle and late 1970s. The unified Vietnam under Thắng experienced early troubles, as political and economic conditions were deteriorating and millions of South Vietnamese were fleeing the country as boat people. As the leader of the united Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Thắng worked hard for several years on a massive reconstruction effort to rebuild both former North and South Vietnam's which were left devastated by years of war which included special projects such as rebuilding the industry, infrastructure, and economy.  Deposing of the Khmer Rouge  Troubles with the newly formed Vietnamese government further progressed in early 1978 when Thắng approached the Soviet Union for help in deposing the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, which was aligned with People's Republic of China (PRC). The situation seemed like a golden opportunity for the Soviet Union because they knew that the Vietnamese army could easily defeat Cambodian forces. A Vietnamese victory would weaken the only aligned nation with the People's Republic of China in Southeast Asia and demonstrate the superiority of being aligned with the Soviet Union. The growing tensions between the PRC and the Soviet Union had drastically escalated the situation in the area. The Soviet Union was anxious about the future outcome of a war by proxy between Vietnam and Cambodia. On December 25, 1978, after months of growing border conflicts and an influx of Cambodians seeking refuge in Vietnam, the Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia. By January 7, 1979, the Vietnamese had easily captured the capital of Cambodia, Phnom Penh, and deposed the Khmer Rouge régime. However, the Soviet Union’s diplomatic victory was short-lived. The PRC was now being backed by the United States, and they increasingly showed signs of being close to war with Vietnam. The Soviets knew that they could not go help the Vietnamese if the PRC decided to invade Vietnam. Not surprisingly, on February 15, 1979, the People's Republic of China officially announced plans to invade Vietnam, thus ending the crucial and significant Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, which had been signed in 1950. The PRC claimed that the invasion was as a result of mistreatment of ethnic Chinese and the Vietnamese presence on the PRC’s Spratly Islands. On February 17, a PRC force of about 200,000 troops had crossed into Thắng's country, and they immediately started to invade Vietnamese cities and towns along Vietnam's northern border. Thắng had left an army of 100,000 men to fight off the PRC, and heavy casualties were reported from both sides. With the Chinese not wanting to linger in Vietnam any longer, they started to move out of the country less than a month later, on March 16. China’s early exit from the country drew up much confusion to who was the victor of the Sino-Vietnamese War. Thắng proclaimed that Vietnam had won the war, while his counterpart in China, Ye Jianying, proclaimed a Chinese victory. However, one thing is sure about the Sino-Vietnamese War’s outcome: Thắng’s Vietnam was able to successfully depose the Khmer Rouge from power in Cambodia.  Death and legacy  Tôn Đức Thắng died on March 30, 1980, in Hanoi, a little more than a year after the conclusion of the Sino-Vietnamese War, at the age of 91 from a heart seizure and respiratory failure. He was the oldest ever president of a country in the world. He was succeeded by one of his vice presidents, Nguyễn Hữu Thọ. He is buried in Mai Dịch Cemetery in the section reserved for the graves of government leaders and famous revolutionaries.Christina Schwenkel - The American War in Contemporary Vietnam: Transnational ... - Page 218 2009 \\"As stated, this practice is generally not found in war cemeteries in contemporary Vietnam, with two important exceptions: Hanoi's Mai Dịch Cemetery, which contains the hierarchically arranged graves of government leaders and other famous revolutionaries, including Phạm Văn Đồng, Lê Duẩn, and Tôn Đức Thắng.

Thắng served as the nation’s leader during the pivotal time when North Vietnam and South Vietnam were reunified as one. However, it was also a time when the country showed signs of exhaustion from 30 years of wars, with the Vietnam People's Army engaged in a long, costly war in Cambodia and Northern border. The economy collapsed in the wake of a failed attempt to collectivize the southern economy, some key party members such as Bùi Tín and Hoàng Văn Hoan defected. It was under his rule that Vietnam survived the subsidy period. Later in 1986, the Sixth Party's Congress passed the Renovation policy which recognized the failure of collectivization and liberalized the economy, opening a new chapter in Vietnam's history.

Dedicated to the Archangel Michael, St. Michael's Church is located at Michaelerplatz across from St. Michael's Gate at the Hofburg Palace. St. Michael's used to be the parish church of the Imperial Court, when it was called Zum heiligen Michael. Over its long history, spanning more than eight centuries, the church has incorporated a medley of architectonic styles. The church is a late Romanesque, early Gothic building dating from about 1220–1240. There is a document giving 1221 as the foundation date of the church, but this is most probably a 14th-century forgery. Over time, there have been many alterations, resulting in its present-day aspect, unchanged since 1792. Interior The interior of the church consists of a nave and two aisles that have conserved the ancient Gothic structure. The side chapels were added later on. It gives the impression of a robust three-dimensional building, despite the church's low height. The polygonal apse was replaced in the 14th century (1327–1340) by an early Gothic choir with three bays. The central and the northern choir chapels were refitted in Baroque style. The high altar was designed in 1782 by Jean-Baptiste d’Avrange. It is decorated with the monumental stucco alabaster Rococo sculpture Fall of the Angels (1782) by sculptor Karl Georg Merville. It represents a cloudburst of angels and cherubs, falling from the ceiling towards the ground. It was the last major Baroque work completed in Vienna. The centerpiece of the high altar is Maria Candia, a Byzantine icon of the Virgin Mary, belonging to the Cretan School of hagiography and named after the former capital (now Heraklion), displayed as being carried by two archangels. In the northern chapel, the altarpiece Adoration of the Child is by Franz Anton Maulbertsch (1754–1755). The southern chapel, the Nikolauskapelle, has remained unchanged and retains its medieval aspect. Its traceried windows date from the 13th century. It displays Gothic stone sculptures under a baldachin (St. Catherine and St. Nicolaus) (1350) and a wooden crucifix by Hans Schlais (1510–1520). This chapel was founded by a cook of the duke at about 1350, giving thanks to the Lord for being acquitted of a poisoning case. The triumphal arch between the transept and the choir dates from the 14th century. Its spandrel is decorated with The Last Judgment. The recently rediscovered frescoes from the early 15th century attest to the high quality of the art of painting in Vienna in those times. The Baptistery shows us in a niche the wooden statue Man of Sorrows (1430). The gilded pipe organ (1714) by Johann David Sieber is the largest Baroque organ in Vienna. It was once played by the 17-year-old Joseph Haydn in 1749. Mozart's Requiem was performed for the first time in this church at a memorial service for the composer on 10 December 1791. As Mozart hadn't finished this work at the time of his death, only the existing part was performed. One of those who attended the \\"festive funerary honors\\" was theater director Emanuel Schikaneder whose libretto was used by Mozart for The Magic Flute. The present façade was built in 1792 in a Neoclassical style by Ernest Koch, a typical style for the reign of emperor Joseph II. Above the entrance, on top of the pediment, resting on Doric columns by Antonio Beduzzi, stands a group with winged angels and St. Michael slaying Lucifer (1725). These sculptural figures were executed by the Italian sculptor Lorenzo Mattielli, who also sculpted the Hercules figures at the Hofburg entrance, just opposite the church. The high polygonal Gothic bell tower from the 16th century has become one of the symbols of the Inner City. Crypt St. Michael's is famous for its Michaelergruft, a large crypt located underneath the church. Aristocrats were able to access their family crypts through marble slabs marked with their coats of arms in the church floor. The coffin of a deceased member of the family could then be lowered directly into the crypt via these marble slabs. Due to the special climatic conditions and constant temperature in the crypt, more than 4000 corpses were kept well preserved. Hundreds of mummified corpses, some still in burial finery or with a wig, are on display, some in open coffins, adorned with flowers or skulls, others decorated with Baroque paintings or with vanitas symbols. The most famous among them is Pietro Metastasio (1698–1782), the most famous writer of opera librettos of the baroque era. Excavations Archaeological excavations in the Michaelerplatz between 1989 and 1991 uncovered among other things the settlement of Canabæ associated with the Roman camp at Vindobona. This will have consisted primarily of the residences of soldiers' wives and children. The excavation site was made permanently accessible to the public in 1991; the design of the presentation is by architect Hans Hollein.

The Irish Parliament adopted the Acts of Supremacy, establishing the king's ecclesiastical supremacy. Some priests, bishops, and those who continued to pray for the pope were tortured and killed. The Treasons Act 1534 caused any act of allegiance to the pope to be considered treason. Many were imprisoned on this basis. In 1536, Charles Reynods was posthumously convicted of high treason for successfully persuading the Pope to excommunicate Henry VIII of England. In 1537, John Travers, the Chancellor of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, was executed under the Act of Supremacy.\\"Martyrs of England and Wales\\" New Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9 (1967), p. 322. Elizabeth I Relations improved after the accession of the Catholic Queen Mary in 1553-58, and in the early years of the reign of her sister Queen Elizabeth I. After Mary's death in November 1558, Elizabeth's Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy of 1559, which re-established the Church of England's separation from the Catholic Church. Initially, Elizabeth adopted a moderate religious policy. The Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity (1559), the Prayer Book of 1559, and the Thirty-Nine Articles (1563) were all Protestant in doctrine, but preserved many traditionally Catholic ceremonies.\\"The Reign of Elizabeth I\\" by J.P. Sommerville, University of Wisconsin. In 1563 the Earl of Essex issued a proclamation, by which all priests, secular and regular, were forbidden to officiate, or even to reside in Dublin. Fines and penalties were strictly enforced for absence from the Protestant service; before long, torture and death were inflicted. Priests and religious were, as might be expected, the first victims. They were hunted into mountains and caves; and the parish churches and few monastic chapels which had escaped the rapacity of Henry VIII.Cusack, Margaret Anne, An Illustrated History of Ireland, libraryireland.com; accessed 11 July 2015. During the early years of her reign no great pressure was put on Catholics to conform to the \\"Established Church\\" of the new regime, but the situation changed rapidly from about 1570 onwards, mainly as a result of Pope Pius V's papal bull Regnans in Excelsis which \\"released [Elizabeth I's] subjects from their allegiance to her\\". In Ireland the First Desmond Rebellion was launched in 1569, at almost the same time as the Northern Rebellion in England. The Wexford Martyrs were found guilty of treason for aiding in the escape of James Eustace, 3rd Viscount Baltinglass and refusing to take the Oath of Supremacy and declare Elizabeth I of England to be the head of the Church. Charles II During this period, the English persecution of Catholics in Ireland was more lenient than usual, owing to the sympathy of the king, until the Popish Plot, a fictitious conspiracy concocted by Titus Oates, between 1678 and 1681 gripped the Kingdoms of England and Scotland in anti-Catholic hysteria. Those caught up in the false allegations included: * Peter Talbot, Archbishop of Dublin (died in prison, November 1680) * Oliver Plunkett, Archbishop of Armagh, executed at Tyburn 1 July 1681 Investigations Irish martyrs suffered over several reigns. There was a long delay in starting the investigations into the causes of the Irish martrys for fear of reprisals. Further complicating the investigation is that the records of these martyrs were destroyed, or not compiled, due to the danger of keeping such evidence. Details of their endurance in most cases have been lost.\\"The Irish Martyrs\\", Irish Jesuits, sacredspace.ie; accessed 16 December 2015. The first general catalog is that of Father John Houling, S.J., compiled in Portugal between 1588 and 1599. It is styled a very brief abstract of certain persons whom it commemorates as sufferers for the Faith under Elizabeth. After Catholic Emancipation in 1829, the cause for Oliver Plunkett was re-visited. As a result, a series of publications on the whole period of persecutions was made. The first to complete the process was Oliver Plunkett, Archbishop of Armagh, canonized in 1975 by Pope Paul VI. Plunkett was certainly targeted by the administration and unfairly tried. Biographies John Kearney John Kearney (1619-1653) was born in Cashel, County Tipperary and joined the Franciscans at the Kilkenny friary. After his novitiate, he went to Leuven in Belgium and was ordained in Brussels in 1642. Returned to Ireland, he taught in Cashel and Waterford, and was much admired for his preaching. In 1650 he became guardian of Carrick-on-Suir, Co Tipperary. During the Cromwellian persecutions, he was arrested and hanged in Clonmel, Co Tipperary. He was buried in the chapter hall of the suppressed friary of Cashel. Peter O'Higgins O.P. Peter O'Higgins was born in Dublin around 1602 during the persecution under James I. He was educated secretly in Ireland and later in Spain. With the accession of Charles I in 1625, a limited tolerance obtained and Peter came back to Dublin and was sent to re-open the Dominican house in Naas. The 1641 rebellion, a result of the plantations, evictions and persecutions (but not in County Kildare), brought with it years of conflict between Irish v Old English, Catholic v Protestant; Puritan v Anglican. During this time the William Pilsworth, Protestant rector of Donadea, was arrested by rebel soldiers and about to be hanged, when Fr. Peter O'Higgins stepped forward. Pilsworth later wrote that when he was on the gallows, \\"a priest whom I never saw before, made a long speech on my behalf saying that this…was a bloody inhuman act that would…draw God's vengeance on them. Whereupon I was brought down and released.\\" The government army moved on Naas in February 1642 and O'Higgins was arrested and turned over to Governor Coote of Dublin. O'Higgins was offered his life if he would renounce his faith. He responded, \\"\\"So here the condition on which I am granted my life. They want me to deny my religion. I spurn their offer. I die a Catholic and a Dominican priest.

Two of the creations are extant as of 2010. The Holden Baronetcy, of Oakworth House in Keighley in the County of York, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom in 1893 for the inventor, manufacturer and Liberal politician Isaac Holden. He had previously represented Knaresborough, Northern West Riding of Yorkshire and Keighley in Parliament. His eldest son, the second Baronet, represented Bradford East and Buckrose in the House of Commons. On 4 July 1908, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Holden, of Alston in the County of Cumberland. The barony became extinct on the death of his grandson, the third Baron, on 6 July 1951. However, the baronetcy was passed on to his second cousin once removed, the fifth Baronet. He was the son of a younger son of the first Baronet. The Holden Baronetcy, of the Grange in the County of Surrey, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom in 1909 for the banker and Liberal politician Edward Holden. The title became extinct on the death of the second Baronet in 1965. The Holden Baronetcy, of The Firs in Leigh in the County of Lancaster, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom in 1919 for John Holden, twice Mayor of Leigh in Lancashire.

The Mohajer family is primarily used for reconnaissance, and is among the most mature and well-known Iranian UAVs. The Mohajer-1 was used during the Iran–Iraq War for battlefield surveillance. The Mohajer-2 was developed in the 1990s with improved avionics and range, and remains in service today. The Mohajer-4 is another evolutionary improvement with again improved range, endurance, and surveillance. The last major variant, the Mohajer-6, is an unmanned combat aerial vehicle that carries two munitions. The Mohajer is used by both the Iranian Army and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). It has been exported to Iranian allies in the Middle East and has been used in the Syrian and Iraqi civil wars. In addition, the Mohajer-2 is license-built in Venezuela as the Arpia.  Mohajer-1  A Mohajer-1 The Mohajer was Iran's first drone to enter series production and was used during the Iran–Iraq War. The Mohajer-1 was known simply as \\"Mohajer\\" through the 80s and 90s, when it was re-designated \\"Mohajer-1\\" as other Mohajer variants had been developed.  Design  The Mohajer-1 had a narrow cylindrical fuselage, twin tailbooms, and straight wings mounted high and to the rear of the body. It had a single engine (unknown model) in a pusher configuration, and was guided by ailerons on the wings, an elevator on the horizontal stabilizer, and rudders on the tailbooms. The Mohajer-1 had three fixed landing gear for launch and recovery. It could also be recovered by parachute. The Mohajer-1 was about 8 feet long and had a wingspan of about 10 feet. Parachute recovery of a Mohajer-1 The Mohajer-1 carried a single still camera, probably carrying photographic film developed after the drone landed. It was controlled by hobby-class radio, which was easily jammed. In addition, Iran attempted to arm it with six RPG-7 rockets, three under each wing, though this was not very successful.  Performance  The Mohajer-1's range is not definitively known, but was severely limited by the hobbyist radio link and lack of an autopilot system, which meant that the aircraft could only surveil Iraqi positions when operated from the Iranian front lines. One source suggests the Mohajer-1 was only able to penetrate 3 km into Iraqi lines. On the other hand, another source says the Mohajer-1 had a range of 50 km, and still another source lists a range of 30 km; this may reflect a difference between the aircraft's theoretical range and its real- world performance. There are no details on the Mohajer-1's airspeed, endurance, or ceiling. These photos, taken by a Mohajer-1, were used by Iran to spot artillery fire during Operation Karbala 5.  Operational history  Qods Aviation was formed in 1985 and four Mohajer-1s were built that year. The Mohajer-1 was operated by the IRGC's Raad Brigade and was used to correct artillery fire and photograph enemy positions. The Mohajer-1's first known use was in Operation Dawn 8 in 1986. It was also used Karbala 5 in 1987. Mohajer UAVs photographed Iraqi lines until the end of the war and completed 619 sorties by the war's end, taking 53,772 photographs in total. The Mohajer-1 is out of service today. Though the Mohjajer-1 is primitive by today's standards and was essentially a hobbyist-class drone, the Iranians were satisfied with its performance, as it was one of only two Iranian surveillance assets in the war, along with RF-4s.  Mohajer-2  Following the successful use of the Mohajer-1, Iran wanted a version with more range and endurance. This version, which would later be named the Mohajer-2, also had an auto pilot system to fly beyond the line-of-control of its command center. The Mohajer-2 was developed in the 1990s and first seen in 1996. It was designed for surveillance use and more than 200 Mohajer-2s had been built.  Design  Iranian personnel prepare a Mohajer-2 for launch. The Mohajer-2 has a bullet-shaped fuselage, mid-mounted, untapered wings, twin tailbooms, twin rudders, belly skids, and a horizontal tail. The belly skids are non-retractable, but can compress on landing to reduce shock. Apart from the skids, it is essentially a refinement of the Mohajer-1 design. Its airframe is composed substantially of composite materials. The Mohajer-2 is 2.91m long and has a wingspan of 3.8 meters. It is powered by a 25 hp WAE-342 two-cylinder engine. The Mohajer-2 has an autopilot system, which is able to maintain airspeed, altitude, and stability in flight. The autopilot system can control the aircraft's course via waypoints, or it can be controlled in real time from a ground control station. Like other Iranian drones, the Mohajer-2 lacks over-the-horizon guidance. The Mohajer-2 has a still or video (color or monochrome) camera, either fixed downwards for aerial surveying or mounted on a gimbal for surveillance. In addition, it has a fixed forwards-facing camera for navigation. There is no evidence the Mohajer-2 has been fitted with an infrared camera. It has an onboard digital processor and can downlink sensor imagery. The Mohajer-2 has two stub antenna in the under 10 GHz range, one on each wing, for real-time control. Prototype Mohajer-2s were fitted with two rocket pods for 12 RPG-7 rockets, similar to the Mohajer-1's, but this model did not enter production. The Mohajer-2 has a GPS guidance system. The Mohajer-2 is launched from a PL3 pneumatic catapult, which can be truck-mounted, wheeled, or ship-mounted. It can also be launched from a JATO platform, though this is uncommon. It is recovered by skid landing or parachute.  Performance  Has an endurance of 1.5 hours and range of 50 km. The Mohajer-2 is about ten feet long and has a wingspan of about 12 feet. The tail wingspan is exactly 3 ft.  Operational history  During the 1990s Afghan civil war, Mohajer drones reportedly monitored the situation. A Mohajer (unknown variant) may have been shot down over Iraq on 19 April 2001. The Mohajer-2 is also known to be operated by Hezbollah. There are also inconclusive reports Mohajer-2s have been used over Syria. In addition to its military use, the Mohajer-2 can also be used for weather reporting. It is possible, but unconfirmed, that the Raad-85 is a variant of the Mohajer-2.  Arpia  Venezuelan Arpia, a license-built copy of the Mohajer-2 In 2007, Venezuela signed an agreement with Iran to assemble 12 Mohajer-2 UAVs from knock-down kits supplied by Quds.https://web.archive.org/web/20121215074802/http://lewis.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/5390/venezuela- iran-uavs Venezuelan state-owned defense contractor CAVIM began assembling the drones by 2009. US satellite imagery revealed the facility manufacturing the drones in 2010, and they were unveiled to the public as the CAVIM Arpia in 2012. Venezuela signed a $28 million contract to manufacture the UAVs, though it is unclear why, because this far exceeds the drones' value.  Mohajer-2N  thumb In 2014, Iran introduced the Mohajer-2N, which shares the same design as the Mohajer-2 but has far improved performance. The Mohajer-2N replaces the electronics of the Mohajer-2 with more modern versions and has also has improved flight characteristics. The Mohajer-2N has a range of 150 km and flight endurance of 6 hours. It is believed this is accomplished through fuel tanks in the wings combined with weight savings elsewhere. Cruise speed is 180 km/h. Body material is composite. The Mohajer-2N is also capable of transmitting imagery in real time. Like most Mojajer-2s, the Mohajer-2N has two cameras; one under the nose for navigation, and a second on a gimbal under the body for surveillance. Visually, the Mohajer-2N is nearly identical to the Mohajer-2. It is mainly \\"distinguished\\" by being 1 cm longer, having a wingspan 2 cm wider, and being five kg heavier. It can be fitted with the Mohajer-2's landing skids or with wheeled landing gear. The Mohajer-2N is recovered by skid landing or parachute.  Mohajer-3  The Mohajer-3, also known as the Dorna, was designed with a new airframe for better performance. It had a square body and featured a low-mounted horizontal stabilizer flush with the main wing, the only member of the Mohajer family configured this way. The Mohajer-3 could be fitted with fixed landing gear, for a runway takeoff, or with skids for a JATO launch. It was recovered by parachute or skid landing. It was powered by an unidentified 25 hp (18.6 kW) piston engine. The Mohajer-3 was announced in 1999. The Mohajer-3 had a color/monochrome still or video camera, and was able to send images in real time. and It had a range of 100 km, an endurance of 2–3 hours, and a cruise speed of 180 km/h. It did not have GPS guidance. It was developed contemporaneously with the Mohajer-4 and did not enter service or production.  Mohajer-4  thumb thumb The Mohajer-4 was designed for both the Iranian Army and the IRGC and entered service in late 1997. It may have entered mass production in 1999. It was first documented in 2003. Sources differ slightly on how many have been built; one sources says that 40 have been built as of 2006, while another says that as of the mid-2000s, 34 had been built.  Design  The Mohajer-4 features a squarish body and low-mounted trapezoidal wings with upward-canted wingtips to lessen drag. It is powered by a two-bladed Limbach L550E four-cylinder, two- stroke 50 hp engine in a pusher configuration. The Mohajer-4 is constructed of composite material. It is 3.64 m long and has a wingspan of 5.3 m. The Mohajer-4 has a modular design, and components such as the body, wings, and tailbooms can be detached and recombined. It has three landing skids. The Mohajer-4 can land via landing gear or a parachute. An Iranian Mohajer-4 in flight The Mohajer-4 has a Hyarat 3 guidance and control system, which includes GPS navigation. It normally follows a preprogrammed flight path, but its mission profile can also be updated in flight via radio uplink. The Mohajer-4 has a fixed forward-facing camera for navigation and either a downward-facing camera for aerial surveying or a gimbal-mounted video camera for surveillance. Sources disagree on whether the Mojajer-4 can carry an infrared camera. Like the Mohajer-2, it has an onboard digital processor and can downlink sensor imagery. The Mohajer-4 is also reportedly capable of being fitted for communications relay and has an 'impressive' electronic warfare capability.  Performance  Operational range is increased to 150 km, altitude to 18000 feet and endurance to 7 hours. With a MTOW of 175 kg, the Mohajer-4 is almost double the weight of older versions. The Mohajer-4 and 4B are operated by a crew of 5-7 men, including two operators. One operator controls the UAV's camera and the ground control station's directional antenna for real time video transfer. The other operator controls the UAV's flight using a software program called FliteMap, which is COTS American software. In common with other Qods Aviation products, the Mohajer-4 can be ineffectively armed with unguided rockets, in this case a total of two Hydra 70 rockets under the wings.  Operational history  On November 7, 2004, Hezbollah flew a UAV over northern Israel for about 5 minutes. The UAV entered Israeli airspace at more than 100 knots and an altitude of about 1,000 feet, flew briefly over the seaside city of Nahariya, and fell into the sea. Some sources have identified the UAV as a Mohajer-4. There are reports that Iran sold eight Mohajer-4s to Hezbollah.Gary Ackerman; Jeremy Tamsett, Jihadists and Weapons of Mass Destruction. CRC Press. . p. 122. Mohajer-4s have been used in the civil wars in Iraq and Syria. On 16 May 2015, the Turkish Air Force shot down a Mohajer-4 that violated its airspace. Mohajer-4s have also crashed, or been shot down, over Islamic State-held territories. A Mohajer-4 in Iraqi markings was downed over Iraq, but it is not clear if the UAV was actually being operated by the Iraqi Armed Forces. A Mohajer-4B Mohajer-4s are located at Iran's Konorak Air Base and at Bandar Jask. There is a designation of the Mohajer-4 called \\"Shahin\\", which may be a sub-variant with unknown differences, or a designation for the Mohajer-4 in Iranian Army Ground service. There is also another sub-variant with unknown differences called the \\"Hodhod A/100\\". In addition, Mohajer-4s are used by Iran's border guard to interdict drug smuggling.  Mohajer-4B  Also known as the Sadiq, the Mohajer-4B is a significant evolution of the Mohajer-4 platform with a square fuselage, twin tailbooms, a top-mounted horizontal stabilizer, uncanted wingtips, new landing skids, and straight wings mounted high and to the mid of the body. It was introduced in late 2014. All serial numbers begin \\"P062A–\\". The Mohajer-4B was designed for reconnaissance and has a fixed, forward-facing camera for navigation. With an expanded payload bay, it can carry an IR/EO sensor mounted on a gimbal and a downward-facing surveying camera at the same time, unlike the Mohajer-2 and Mohajer-4, which could only carry one at a time. The Mohajer-4B has a flight ceiling of 15,000 feet, a (max) speed of 200 km/h, and an operational radius of 200 km. It weighs 242 kg and has an endurance of 6 hours. It may have a wingspan of approximately 7 meters. A Sadegh-1 An estimated 36 Mohajer-4Bs have been built as of 2015. Mohajer-4Bs have been used over Syria. A Mohajer-4B flew over, and was reportedly shot down by, the USS Boxer on 18 July 2019.  Sadegh-1  The Sadegh-1 (\\"Honest-1\\"), also known as the QOM-1, is simply a Mohajer-4B with two MANPADS mounted on pylons. It was tested in late 2014 and was used to harass a US Navy jet fighter in 2017. The integration work is believed to be performed by Shahid Shah Abhady Industrial Complex. Independent assessments of the Sadgh-1 range from \\"it probably doesn’t work very well\\" to \\"fakery.\\" Another source speculates it might be useful for air defense for Iranian-backed militia groups in Lebanon and Gaza. There is no Mohajer-5. possibly the Mohajer 4-B is considered as the Mohajer 5.  Mohajer-6  The Qods Mohajer-6 is a persistent ISTAR UAV capable of carrying a multispectral surveillance payload and/or up to two precision-guided munitions. Ten have been manufactured as of February 2018 for the IRGC Ground Forces, and 40 are planned for the IRGC Navy. The Mohajer-6 complements the larger Shahed 129 operated by the third IRGC branch, the IRGC-ASF. Three have also been delivered to the Iranian Army. The Mohajer-6 entered serial production in February 2018. As with other members of the Mohajer family, the Mohajer-6 is made of composite.  Design  A Mohaher-6 with a Qaem missile under the wing The Mohajer-6 has a rectangular fuselage, an upwards-sloping nose, twin tailbooms, a top-mounted horizontal stabilizer, uncanted wingtips, straight wings mounted high and to the rear of the body, and air intakes on the top and bottom of the engine. The Mohajer-6 is controlled by two elevators on the horizontal stabilizer, rudders on the vertical stabilizers, and two flaps per wing. Unlike other Mohajer variants, it has a three-bladed propeller. The Mohajer-6 has a wingspan of 10 meters and is 5.67 meters long. It is similar in shape to the Selex ES Falco. The Mohajer-6 has fixed tricycle landing gear, which underwent changes between the unveiling ceremony in 2017 and mass production in 2018, perhaps to accommodate more weight. It is launched and recovered via runway takeoff/landing. Qaem air to ground bomb It has a fixed, forward facing camera for navigation and a gimbal on the chin for a laser range finder and multispectral IR and visible light electro-optical imagery. The Mohajer-6 has three antennas, two on its left wing and one on its right, and a pitot tube on its nose. The Mohajer-6 has two hardpoints, one under each wing, which can each carry one Qaem TV/IR-guided missile. It has an autopilot system capable of automatic takeoff and landing. In addition, Iran describes it as capable of being fitted with electronic support measures, communications jamming, or electronic warfare payloads.  Performance  The Mohajer-6 has a max takeoff weight of 600 kg, a payload of 40 kg, and an operating range of 200 km. It has a max speed of 200 km/h, an endurance of 12 hours, and a ceiling of 18000 feet. Multiple sources say that although the Mohajer-6 is designed by Qods Aviation, it is manufactured by Qods' longtime rival, Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industrial Company (HESA). Both Qods and HESA are subsidiaries of Iran's state-owned Aerospace Industries Organization.  Operational history  Iran's Aerospace Industries Organization describes the Mohajer-6 as \\"operationally proven,\\" and it has reportedly been used against the salafist-jihadist terrorist group Jaish ul-Adl that is active in Iran's southern regions. Some Mohajer-6s seem to be based at Qeshm Island. In July 2019 Iran used the Mohajer-6 against PJAK militants. An estimated 30 Mohajer-6 drones have been built as of July 2019.

After instruction in the religious life, she founded a community, initially consisting of eight virgins and a widow with a baby, at Slieve Gullion, in what became County Armagh. They lived an eremitical life, based on that of Elijah and Saint John the Baptist. Moninne died in 517. Her feast day is 6 July. Life Moninne was born around 435 in the Donaghmore area of County Down. Her father was Machta, King of the territory stretching from Louth to Armagh and her mother was Comwi or Coman daughter of one of the northern kings. It was said that she was baptised and confirmed by Saint Patrick. When he was passing through the lands of Machta he stopped at her parents' house and predicted that Moninne's name would be remembered throughout time. It was said that she was veiled by Saint Patrick also. There are a couple of versions of the name Moninne, for example Darerca, Blinne or the spelling Moninna which means in Irish \\"My Ninna\\" or \\"My Daughter\\". A legend says that she got the name \\"Moninna\\" when she cured a dumb man and the first word he uttered was \\"Ninna Ninna\\". It was also said that when she was a baby the first word she said was Ninna. She is said to have been brought up by St. Brigid of Kildare. Monenna founded a number of convents in Scotland and England and also founded a monastery of nuns in Faughart, Co. Louth,\\"St. Morinne's Well\\", Armagh Archdiocese One night the nuns were disturbed by sounds of profane merriment from the homesteads lower down the hill, and when they enquired the cause were told that there was a wedding party in one of the houses. Moninne and her sisters, who knew no other espousal than that of Christ, thereupon determined to seek for themselves a place more suited to their way of life. She took her Sisters west to the island of Begerin to be guided in the ways of monastic life by her uncle,Bitel, Lisa M. Land of Women, Cornell University Press, 1998 one of the first Irish bishops, St. Ibar.Duffy, Patrick. \\"Saint Moninne of Killeavy\\", CatholicIreland.net The community eventually returned from Leinster to the north of Ireland, settling first at Faughart, then at Killeavy.Robert Bartlett, \\"Moninne (d. 517)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 15 Nov 2014 Faughart Church was founded by Saint Moninne in honour of Brigid. The monastery at Killeavy (meaning “church of the mountain”), initially consisting of eight virgins and a widow with a baby boy. The lad, whose name was Luger, was lovingly raised by the sisters and in time became a bishop. The number of nuns eventually grew to over 150. She died around the year 517 and was buried at Killeavy. Veneration A large granite stone covers the supposed grave of St Moninne and on days when the Pattern (which was the anniversary of the day on which a church had been dedicated to a saint) was celebrated, prayers were said at this spot and the pilgrims continued to her Holy Well further up the slopes of Slieve Gullion, returning to this gravestone for the final prayer. The grave of St Monnina, Killeavy Graveyard The Pattern Day of St Moninne was 6 July, but with the coming of persecution to the Catholic faith, these religious ceremonies were banned by law. After the suppression of the Pattern in 1825, the existence of the Holy Well was forgotten about but it was re-discovered by Father James Donnelly, C. C., Meigh in 1880. Saint Moninne's Well is marked by a large white cross. The Pattern was revived in 1928 and appears to have survived until 1934. A shrine was placed over the well with a statue Of the Virgin Mary.

He also played in the Football League for Bristol City.  Career  Foster was born in Rawmarsh, Yorkshire and began his career in non-league football with Parkgate Athletic and Rotherham Town. He moved to First Division club Bristol City in 1909, but made just 13 appearances, scoring one goal. Foster's prolific scoring for the Bristol City reserve team in the Great Western Suburban League prompted newly promoted Southern League First Division club Reading to sign him for a £75 fee in August 1911. A successful player with Reading, he was remembered for his hat-trick scored against Italian giants AC Milan in the Biscuitmen's 5–0 victory on 13 May 1914. The result prompted the leading Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera to report that \\"without doubt, Reading FC are the finest foreign team seen in Italy\\". Foster finished his professional career with Reading with 73 goals.  Personal life  Foster was married and while a footballer with Parkgate Athletic, he worked in the fitter's room at a colliery. In 1914, during the early months of the First World War, Foster enlisted as a private in the Football Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment. On 8 August 1916, he went over the top with the battalion at Guillemont, during the Battle of Delville Wood and was shot in the thigh, abdomen and arm. Foster was recovered by four stretcher-bearers from no man's land and was transported to a hospital in Corbie, where he died of his wounds. He was buried in Corbie Communal Cemetery Extension.

(died 792) was founder and abbot-bishop of the monastery of Tallaght (Co. Dublin, Ireland). He is often considered to be a leading figure of the monastic 'movement' that has become known to scholarship as the Céli Dé. He is not to be confused with the later namesake Máel Ruain, bishop of Lusca (Co. Dublin). The foundation of Tallaght Little is known of his life. Máel Ruain is not his personal name bestowed at birth or baptism, but his monastic name, composed of Old Irish máel (\\"one who is tonsured\\") and Ruain (\\"of Rúadán\\"), which may mean that he was a monk of St. Rúadán's monastery in Lothra (north Co. Tipperary).Byrnes, \\"Máel-Ruain.\\" In Medieval Ireland. Encyclopedia (2005). pp. 308–9. Though his background and early career remain obscure, he is commonly credited with the foundation of the monastery of Tallaght, sometimes called \\"Máel Ruain's Tallaght\\",Doherty, \\"Leinster, saints of.\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004). in the latter half of the 8th century. This may be supported by an entry for 10 August in the Martyrology of Tallaght, which notes that Máel Ruain came to Tallaght carrying with him \\"relics of the holy martyrs and virgins\\" (cum suis reliquiis sanctorum martirum et uirginum),Martyrology of Tallaght, ed. Best and Lawlor, p. 62. apparently with an eye to founding his house. There is at any rate no evidence for a religious establishment at Tallaght prior to Máel Ruain's arrival and although Tamlachtae, the Old Irish name for Tallaght, refers to a burial ground, it was not yet the rule for cemeteries to be located adjacent to a church. Precise details of the circumstances are unknown. A line in the Book of Leinster has been read as saying that in 774 the monk obtained the land at Tallaght from the Leinster king Cellach mac Dúnchada (d. 776), who came from the Uí Dúnchada sept of the Uí Dúnlainge branch of the Laigin, but there is no contemporary authority from the annals to support the statement. In the Martyrology of Tallaght and the entries for his death in the Irish annals (see below), he is styled a bishop. Liturgy and teachings The best known disciple of Máel Ruain's community was Óengus the Culdee, the author of the Félire Óengusso, a versified martyrology or calendar commemorating the feasts of Irish and non-Irish saints, and possibly also of the earlier prose version, the Martyrology of Tallaght. In his epilogue to the Félire Óengusso, written sometime after Máel Ruain's death, Óengus shows himself much indebted to his \\"tutor\\" (aite), whom he remembers elsewhere as \\"the great sun on Meath's south plain\\" (grían már desmaig Midi).Félire Óengusso, ed. Stokes, pp. 266–7 (Epilogue, lines 61-8); p. 26 (Prologue, lines 225-8). See also p. 161 (7 July, Máel Ruain's feastday). In the early ninth century, Tallaght also seems to have produced the so-called Old Irish Penitential.Follett, Céli Dé in Ireland, pp. 2–3. Although liturgical concerns are evident in the two martyrologies, there is no strictly contemporary evidence for Máel Ruain's own monastic principles and practices. Evidence for his teachings and their influence comes chiefly by way of a number of 9th-century writings associated with the Tallaght community known collectively as the 'Tallaght memoir'. One of the principal texts is The Monastery of Tallaght (9th century), which claims to list the precepts and habits of Máel Ruain and some of his associates, apparently as remembered by his follower Máel Díthruib of Terryglass. Much of the text survives in a 15th- century manuscript, RIA MS 1227 (olim MS 3 B 23), and in the 17th century, an Early Modern Irish paraphrase was produced now referred to as The Teaching of Máel Ruain. Of less certain origin is the text known as the Rule of Céli Dé, which is preserved in the Leabhar Breac (15th century) and contains various instructions for the regulation and observance of monastic life, notably in liturgical matters. It is ascribed to both Óengus and Máel Ruain, but the text in its present form is a prose rendering from the original verse, possibly written in the 9th century by one of his community. These works of guidance appear to have been modelled on the sayings of the Desert Fathers of Egypt, in particular the Conferences of John Cassian. Typical concerns in them include the importance of daily recitation of the Psalter, of self-restraint and forbearance from indulgences in bodily desires and of separation from worldly concerns. Against the practices of earlier Irish monastic movements, Máel Ruain is cited as forbidding his monks to go on an overseas pilgrimage, preferring instead to foster communal life in the monastery. Máel Ruain's reputation as a teacher whose influence on the monastic world extended beyond the confines of the cloister walls is further suggested by the later tract Lucht Óentad Máele Ruain (\\"Folk of the Unity of Máel Ruain\\"), which enumerates the twelve most prominent associates who embraced his teachings. They are said to include Óengus, Máel Díthruib of Terryglass, Fedelmid mac Crimthainn, king of Cashel, Diarmait ua hÁedo Róin of Castledermot (Co. Kildare) and Dímmán of Araid. Death and veneration The Annals of Ulster report under the year 792 that Máel Ruain died a peaceful death, calling him a bishop (episcopus) and soldier of Christ (miles Christi).Annals of Ulster s.a. 792. In the Annals of the Four Masters, however, in which he is also styled \\"bishop\\", his death is assigned, probably incorrectly, to the year 787. His feast in the Martyrology of Tallaght and Félire Óengusso is on 7 July.Martyrology of Tallaght, ed. Best and Lawlor, p. 94-5; Félire Óengusso, ed. Stokes, p. 161. He was succeeded as abbot of Tallaght by Airerán. Contemporary Placenames In the contemporary period, St. Maelrun is associated with the Oldbawn area of Tallaght; a local primary school is named after the saint, as is a section of houses in the OldBawn area. The local St. Maelruain's Church, Tallaght is a Church of Ireland church in Tallaght village named after the saint located within the Diocese of Dublin and Glendalough.

The film stars Jackie Gleason (in a silent role) and was directed by Gene Kelly. Synopsis Gigot (Gleason) (the name means \\"leg of mutton\\" in French) is a mute Frenchman living in a cellar in the Ménilmontant district of Paris in the 1920s. He ekes out a hand-to-mouth existence as a janitor at his landlady's apartment building. He is routinely treated with condescension by neighbors and often is made the butt of practical jokes. However, he is a decent and kindhearted fellow, traits not unnoticed by children and the animals he often feeds. Gigot has one unusual predilection: he is attracted by funeral processions and finds himself attending, whether or not he ever knew the departed. He can't help but cry along with all the other mourners. After being abused by locals at a pub, he chances upon a woman, Colette (Katherine Kath), and her 6-year-old daughter Nicole (Diane Gardner), huddled in a doorway trying to stay dry. He takes them to his dingy basement abode, gives them what food and drink he has, a bed to sleep in, and shelter from the rain. Colette is suspicious but is so exhausted that she accepts. Gigot gleefully dotes upon Nicole. Gigot is astonished to discover she is ignorant of what a church is, completely unaware of God. Nicole points to a crucifix and asks about it. The mute attempts to act out the story of Christ, beginning with Mary cradling the baby Jesus, from childhood through to the horror of crucifixion. Gigot rails at this Christ who has seemingly left him so inadequate. Nicole cries a single tear for him, then blows a reassuring kiss of love to the Christ upon the Cross. Gigot entertains the little girl by dancing to his old gramophone, and by dressing as a waiter to feed his pet mouse. He is very protective, running alongside her on a merry-go-round to make sure she doesn't fall off. He also intervenes to protect Colette's honor while she is in the act of propositioning a man that has sexual intercourse with prostitutes to pick her and use her services the merry-go-round. Gigot is trounced by the frustrated man for his trouble. Furious over his interference with her \\"activities,\\" Colette threatens to bolt with Nicole unless Gigot can provide her a life with a \\"man of means.\\" Given only an hour to prove himself, Gigot happens past a bakery. The baker and his wife (having taken advantage of him for years) have been called away, thus leaving their till unattended. Gigot seizes the opportunity and steals their money. With those ill-gotten gains, Gigot goes on a shopping spree, buying much-needed new clothes for Colette and Nicole, with a straw boater and a shave for himself. He buys a grand meal and drinks for all at a restaurant. But the good times are not to last — Colette's ex-boyfriend wants her back, and Colette succumbs. She expects to take Nicole along, but her pimp persuades her to wait. The next morning, two bumbling bureaucrats try to remove Gigot to a home for the feeble-minded. Meanwhile, the baker has discovered the theft, and when Colette returns, Gigot and Nicole are missing. Gigot becomes a suspect, but he and Nicole are only playing at an abandoned basement chamber below the streets of Paris, while Gigot dances for her with so much gusto that the roof timbers fall in. They are nearly buried in rubble and Nicole is unconscious. Believing she is dead, Gigot rushes the girl to the church where the priest calls a doctor. Gigot runs into the angry mob, then flees into a coal barge loader and is washed into the river. He fails to resurface. Thinking him dead, the locals are despondent over their despicable actions. In remorse they organise a funeral for Gigot, though all they have is his chapeau to bury. Gigot survived and is merely hiding. Unknowingly, he witnesses his own funeral procession and as usual is compelled to join it. When the time comes for the eulogy, he realizes it is for him. Gigot is spotted by the crowd and the chase begins again. Background and other information Gleason had conceived the story himself years earlier and had long dreamed of making the film. He wanted Orson Welles as director, and Paddy Chayefsky as screenwriter. Though Welles was an old friend, the board at Fox rejected him as being an overspender. Gene Kelly was selected as a compromise. Chayefsky was not interested and John Patrick, writer of Teahouse of the August Moon, was signed instead. The film was shot on location in Paris. Most of the production crew and cast were French; some spoke no English. Gleason bore with this in two ways: Kelly spoke French, and Gleason's character had no lines, being mute. Gleason was extremely proud of the film, which earned one Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Score. Gleason received a story credit and a music credit. On the other hand, according to the book, The Films of Gene Kelly, by Tony Thomas, Kelly himself said that the movie \\"had been so drastically cut and reedited that it had little to do with my version\\".

The kingdoms in chronological order are the Thaton Kingdom (9th century–1057), the Hanthawaddy Kingdom (1287–1539), and the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom (1740–1757). Early states The first recorded kingdom attributed to the Mon people is Dvaravati, which prospered until around 1000 CE when their capital was sacked by the Khmer Empire and a significant portion of the inhabitants fled west to present-day Lower Burma and eventually founded new polities. Thaton (9th century–1057) Mainstream scholarship holds that the Mon established small polities (or large city-states) in Lower Burma. Both the city of Thaton and Pegu (Bago) are believed to have been established in the 9th century. The states were important trading ports between Indian Ocean and mainland Southeast Asia. Still, according to traditional reconstruction, the early Mon city-states were conquered by the Pagan Kingdom from the north in 1057, and that Thaton's literary and religious traditions helped to mould early Pagan civilisation.Htin Aung 1967: 32–33 Between 1050 and about 1085, Mon craftsmen and artisans helped to build some two thousand monuments at Pagan, the remains of which today rival the splendors of Angkor Wat.South 2003: 67 The Mon script is considered to be the source of the Burmese script, the earliest evidence of which was dated to 1058, a year after the Thaton conquest, by the colonial era scholarship.Harvey 1925: 307 However, recent research—still a minority view—argues that Mon influence on the interior after Anawrahta's conquest is a greatly exaggerated post-Pagan legend, and that Lower Burma in fact lacked a substantial independent polity prior to Pagan's expansion.Lieberman 2003: 91 Possibly in this period, the delta sedimentation—which now extends the coastline by a century—remained insufficient, and the sea still reached too far inland, to support a population even as large as the modest population of the late precolonial era. (The earliest evidence of Burmese script is dated to 1035, and possibly as early as 984 CE. Recent research argues that the Pyu script was the source of the Burmese script.)Aung-Thwin 2005: 167–178, 197–200 Though the size and importance of these states are still debated, all scholars accept that during the 11th century, Pagan established its authority in Lower Burma and this conquest facilitated growing cultural exchange, if not with local Mon, then with India and with Theravada stronghold Sri Lanka. From a geopolitical standpoint, Anawrahta's conquest of Thaton checked the Khmer advance in the Tenasserim coast. Hanthawaddy (1287–1539, 1550–1552) Hanthawaddy Kingdom c. 1400 In 1287, the Pagan Empire collapsed due to Mongol invasions, and all its vassal states became independent. In present-day Lower Burma, Wareru established a kingdom for the Mon-speaking people called Ramannadesa by unifying three Mon-speaking regions of Lower Burma: Martaban (Mottama), Pegu (Bago), the Irrawaddy delta.Htin Aung 1967: 78–80 The kingdom's first capital was at Martaban but the capital was moved to Pegu in 1369. For its first 100 years, the kingdom was merely a loose collection of three Mon-speaking regions. The high kings at the capital had little substantive authority over the vassals. Indeed, Martaban was in open rebellion from 1363 to 1389. A more centralised rule came with the reign of King Razadarit, who not only firmly unified the three Mon-speaking regions together but also successfully fended off the northern Burmese-speaking Kingdom of Ava in the Forty Years' War (1385–1424). The war ended in a stalemate but it was a victory for Hanthawaddy as Ava finally gave up its dream of restoring the Pagan Empire. In the years following the war, Pegu occasionally aided Ava's southern vassal states of Prome and Toungoo in their rebellions but carefully avoided getting plunged into a full-scale war. After the war, Hanthawaddy entered its golden age whereas its rival Ava gradually went into decline. From the 1420s to the 1530s, Hanthawaddy was the most powerful and prosperous kingdom of all post- Pagan kingdoms. Under a string of especially gifted monarchs—Binnya Ran I, Shin Sawbu, Dhammazedi and Binnya Ran II—the kingdom enjoyed a long golden age, profiting from foreign commerce. Its merchants traded with traders from across the Indian Ocean, filling the king's treasury with gold and silver, silk and spices, and all the other stuff of early modern trade. The kingdom also became a famous centre of Theravada Buddhism. It established strong ties with Ceylon, and encouraged reforms that later spread throughout the country.Myint-U 2006: 64–65 The powerful kingdom's end came abruptly. Due to the inexperience of King Takayutpi, the kingdom was captured by a smaller kingdom to the north, Kingdom of Toungoo in 1539 led by King Tabinshwehti and his deputy Gen. Bayinnaung. Toungoo captured the Irrawaddy delta and Pegu in 1538–1539, and Martaban in 1541.Harvey 1925: 153–157 The kingdom was briefly revived in 1550 after Tabinshwehti was assassinated. But Bayinnaung quickly defeated the rebellion in 1552. Restored Hanthawaddy (1740–1757) Though Toungoo kings would rule all of Lower Burma well into the mid-18th century, the golden age of Hanthawaddy was fondly remembered by the Mon. In 1740, they rose up against a weak Toungoo Dynasty on its last legs, and succeeded in restoring the fallen Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Supported by the French, the upstart kingdom quickly carved out a space for itself in Lower Burma, and continued its push northward. On 23 March 1752, its forces captured Ava, and ended the 266-year-old Toungoo dynasty. A new dynasty called Konbaung led by King Alaungpaya rose in Upper Burma to challenge the southern forces, and went on to conquer all of Upper Burma by January 1754. After Hanthawaddy's second invasion of Upper Burma failed in May 1754, the kingdom's leadership in self- defeating measures killed off the Toungoo royal family, and persecuted ethnic Burmans in the south, both of which only strengthened Alaungpaya's hand.Lieberman 2003: 202–206 In 1755, Alaungpaya invaded Lower Burma. Konbaung forces captured the Irrawaddy delta in May 1755, the French defended port of Thanlyin in July 1756, and finally the capital Pegu in May 1757. The fall of Restored Hanthawaddy was the beginning of the end of Mon people's centuries- old dominance of Lower Burma. Konbaung armies' reprisals forced thousands of Mons to flee to Siam.Myint-U 2006: 97 By the early 19th century, assimilation, inter-marriage, and mass migration of Burman families from the north had reduced the Mon population to a small minority.

(1450s) Part of the St Bertin altarpiece, Berlin Simon Marmion (c. 1425 – 24 or 25 December 1489) was a French and Burgundian Early Netherlandish painter of panels and illuminated manuscripts. Marmion lived and worked in what is now France but for most of his lifetime was part of the Duchy of Burgundy in the Southern Netherlands. Life Like many painters of his era, Marmion came from a family of artists, and both his father, Jean, and his brother Mille were painters. Marmion is recorded as working at Amiens between 1449 and 1454, and then at Valenciennes from 1458 until his death. He was patronized by Philip the Good, the Duke of Burgundy from 1454 when he was one of several artists called to Lille to work on the decorations for the Feast of the Pheasant.Campbell, 300 He was employed by several members of the ducal family, including Charles the Bold and Margaret of York. He was called \\"the prince of illuminators\\" by a near contemporary. Three years after his death his widow, Jeanne de Quaroube, married his pupil, the painter Jan Provoost, who on her death inherited the considerable Marmion estate. Although best known for his illuminated manuscripts, Marmion also produced portraits and other paintings, altarpieces, and decorative work. A famous double-sided altarpieceStrictly, the shutters normally used to cover up a carved altarpiece. The \\"inside\\" side is in grisaille. with several Scenes from the life of St Bertin is in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin (with two sections in the National Gallery (London).Campbell, 300-309 There is a Mass of Saint Gregory in Toronto, and a Lamentation of Christ in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,Kren & S McKendrick, 100-102, 107 Metropolitan three works in Philadelphia, and several others elsewhere. Stylistically he lies between his French and Flemish contemporaries, with a Flemish innovation in composition and landscape. His perspective is usually technically sound, but the proportions of his figures are often awkward, and their poses rather stiff. Manuscripts His masterpiece, a Grandes Chroniques de France, is now in the Russian National Library, St Petersburg. This has 25 large miniatures (215 x 258 mm) and 65 smaller ones, ranging in style from brilliantly-coloured battle-scenes to some in an innovative near-grisaille style, with just touches of subdued colour. The illustrations reflect the text, which is an unusual version stressing Netherlandish events, and apparently intended to justify Philip the Good's claim to the French throne.Voronova & Sterligov, 120 The same library has a medical text with a fine presentation miniature with another portrait of Philip the Good, and heraldic borders.Voronova & Sterligov, 118-119 His manuscript of The Visions of Tondal in the Getty Museum (1475) is another important work, and he also produced many more conventional Books of Hours and other manuscripts;Kren & S McKendrick, 98 his most elaborate book of hours is the Huth Hours (ca. 1480) in the British Library, with 24 full-page miniatures, and 74 smaller ones.British Library In a book of hours now in Naples, known as la Flora he painted 22 full-page miniatures that pioneered close-up small groups of a few figures seen at half-length, which represent \\"his most distinctive illumination and perhaps his greatest achievement\\".T Kren, in Kren & S McKendrick, 330 The Morgan Library and Huntington Library also have fine books of hours by Marmion. The Mouth of Hell, by Simon Marmion, from the Getty manuscript of The Visions of Tondal, detail. The \\"Simon Marmion Hours\\" (not the only manuscript so called) in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London (1475–81) is, with pages 11 x 7.6 cm (4 3/8 x 3 in.), an example of the fashion for very small but lavish books of hours.Harthan, 148 Here the borders are especially fine, in some cases going beyond the usual flowers and foliage to include ones showing collections of ivory and enamel plaques, and other pilgrim's souvenirs arrayed on shelves.Illus. Harthan, 150 The book appears to have been made without a specific owner in mind, as there is none of the usual heraldry in the borders and the choice of saints' days included in the calendar is generalized for Bruges and Northern France - by this period books of hours could be bought ready-made, but not usually of this quality. The only full-page miniature without borders in the book is an unusual scene of Heaven and Hell, opposite a Last Judgement on the facing page.Harthan, 148, illus. 147 The lower two thirds show a fiery hellish landscape, while above naked figures cross a narrow bridge over a lake to a grassy park-like heaven – if they can evade the devils with hooked poles in the water, who try to grab them. Many scenes in the Getty Tondal, and a large Dream of Charles the Bald in the Petersberg Chroniques also contain striking images on these themes, anticipating those of Hieronymous Bosch. Identity questioned Between the late 19th century and the mid-20th century, art historians attributed various works to Marmion. However, from 1969, a scholarly counter-movement led by art historian Antoine de Schruyver suggested that Marmion's body of work came from a number of hands.JSTOR The Case of Simon Marmion: Attributions & Documents, Sandra Hindman,Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte, Vol 40 , H. 3/4 (1977), pp. 185-204. At its largest figures, Marmion's oeuvre amounts to some 40 each of manuscripts and panel paintings, but though his life and his reputation are both covered by contemporary documentation, he cannot be clearly connected by documents to specific surviving works - most of the biographical documentation relates to his ownership of real estate property. The circumstantial evidence is strong: the abbot at Saint-Omer (near Valenciennes) who commissioned the St. Bertin altarpiece, Guillaume Filastre, also commissioned the Petersberg Chroniques and another MS by the same artist. Marmion is recorded as producing a breviary ordered by Philip the Good between 1467 and 1470, and a detached miniature in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Lehman Collection) may come from this.Campbell, 300 Metropolitan, who are more confident of the identification Notes References * Campbell, Lorne.

It is located some south from Panevėžys on the banks of the Upytė River, a tributary to the Nevėžis River. According to 2017 estimate, it had 1,440 residents. History The name \\"Ramygala\\" was first mentioned in the 13th century. In 1370 the place suffered from the Teutonic Knight attack. Sometime before 1500 the first church was built and in 1503 the name \\"Ramygala\\" was used to refer to a town. Since then Ramygala slowly grew. Few years later it had a manor, and at the end of the 16th century it received a privilege to host fairs. Unlike many other towns in Lithuania, Ramygala did not belong to a noble family but rather to Vilnius Cathedral and later to Vilnius University. In 1781 the town established a parish school next to a new church after the old one was destroyed by fire. The school grew and expanded significantly in the 20th century. It built two new school buildings and a dorm. In 2005 it was named Ramygala Gymnasium. The school hosts a small museum dedicated to the local history and traditions. A new Neo Gothic church was built in 1897–1914. It has 3 aisles and 3 altars. It features only one bell tower. The tower was damaged during World War II, but was rebuilt in the 1950s. Administration Since the second half of the 18th century, Ramygala was administrative center of a valsčius. After the administrative reform by the Soviet authorities in 1950, the town became a capital of a raion (Lithuanian: rajonas). In 1962 Ramygala lost the status of the capital of a raion. Now it is a center of an eldership, the smallest administrative division in Lithuania. It has a small hospital and a library.

Early life Liebel was born December 12, 1870, in Erie, Pennsylvania, and is the son of Michael and Clara (née Uhr) Liebel. His father, Michael Liebel Sr. was born June 17, 1843, in Germany and was the son of John and Barbara (née Hammer) Liebel, who also lived in Erie, Pennsylvania. Michael Liebel Sr. was 14 years old when his parents came to Erie, Pennsylvania, from Germany. He served an apprenticeship at the shoemaking trade, and in 1861 he started his own boot and shoe business, which he continued for five years. He invested in local realty with his brother Reinhard Liebel, which eventually became very extensive. Liebel Sr. died in May 1906. Michael and Clara Liebel had three sons: Eugene Liebel, who died in 1923, Michael Liebel Jr., and Frederick W. Liebel, who died in 1896. Liebel was educated in the public and parochial schools of Erie and attended college Canisius College in Buffalo, New York, graduating in 1887. Career After graduating from college, Liebel was an accountant in the Buffalo office of the Nickel Plate Railroad for five years. He then returned to Erie, where he was employed in the office of Jackson Koehler, at that time conducting one of the leading breweries of this section of the state, for another five years. In 1898, he organized the Cascade Brewing Company, and served as Corporate Secretary and Treasurer until 1890 when it was consolidated with the Erie Brewing Company, which operated until prohibition. Mayor of Erie A member of the Democratic party, Liebel served as Mayor of Erie, Pennsylvania, from 1906 to 1911. His first term started in September, 1906, when he received the appointment to fill a vacancy caused by the death of Mayor Robert J. Saltsman. In the subsequent election of 1907, he was chosen by the popular vote to fill the remainder of the unexpired term until April 1, 1908. Liebel served in office as Mayor until 1911. After leaving office as Mayor, Liebel organized and became President of the Vulcan Rubber Company which manufactured tires, tubes and hard rubber accessories. United States House of Representatives Liebel ran and was elected the Democratic representative of the 25th district of Pennsylvania to the Sixty- fourth Congress serving in that office from March 4, 1915, until March 4, 1917. While in office, he served on the Naval Committee. In 1916, Liebel challenged A. Mitchell Palmer of Stroudsburg to be the National Committeemean of the Pennsylvania State Democratic Party, but was defeated by Palmer. He was not a candidate for renomination and after retiring from political office in 1917, he resumed his former business activities as president of the Vulcan Rubber Company, as well as President of the Erie Reduction Company, an Erie- based fertilizer manufacturer, with offices in Sandusky, Ohio. Delegate to the Democratic National Convention Liebel was a delegate to five Democratic National Conventions. His first, while Mayor of Erie, was the 1908 Democratic National Convention followed by the 1912, and the 1916 Convention as a member of the United States House of Representatives. He continued to attend the Conventions as a delegate after leaving elected office, attending the 1920, and 1924 Conventions.

His single-season touchdown pass record stood for 16 years until it was broken in the 2006 Hawaii Bowl by University of Hawaii quarterback Colt Brennan with 58, though Brennan needed three more games than Klingler to break the record. Klingler made a valiant push to win the Heisman Trophy but was eventually beaten by Ty Detmer of Brigham Young University and Raghib Ismail (runner-up) of Notre Dame. Klingler remained a stand-out for the University of Houston and still ranks in the top ten for career touchdown passes and yards in a career. NFL career Klingler was taken in the 1st round of the 1992 NFL Draft by the Cincinnati Bengals. From 1992 to 1995 he played for the Bengals--starting for the Bengals in 1993 and 1994 before losing his job to Jeff Blake. He then played two seasons as a backup for the Oakland Raiders. In 1998, he signed with the Green Bay Packers to back up Brett Favre, but he was cut and didn't play. Klingler injured his elbow and shoulder in the offseason before his third season. After the 1994 season (his third), he underwent elbow surgery. Being informed that his injury was career ending, he knew that his career was all but done. Before the operation he could heave a ball 85 yards; afterward he struggled to reach 35. After the NFL Klingler entered school at Dallas Theological Seminary, earning both a master's degree in Theology and a Ph.D. in Old Testament studies. In June 2010, he became the director of DTS's Houston extension. On April 15, 2012, it was announced that Klingler was elected as assistant professor of biblical studies at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary's Havard School of Theological Studies in Houston. Klingler was also an analyst for the University of Houston's football radio network from 2006 to 2008.

AALL's mission is to promote and enhance the value of law libraries to the legal and public communities, to foster the profession of law librarianship, and to provide leadership in the field of legal information and information policy.\\" History and vision AALL was founded in 1906. The American Association of Law Libraries' vision is to be > \\"a thriving professional association whose members and libraries-whether > physical or virtual legal information services-are recognized as critical to > the success of their organizations and as central to society. AALL members > possess the knowledge and skills to maintain effectiveness in a constantly > changing legal environment. Since the ready availability of legal > information is a necessary requirement for a just and democratic society, > AALL and its members advocate and work toward fair and equitable access to > authentic current and historic legal information, and educate and train > library users to be knowledgeable and skilled legal information consumers.\\" The first president of the AALL was Arthur James Small (1869-1937), who was elected at the association's formation on July 2, 1906. Small was a law librarian at the Iowa State Library, and it was his idea to create an organization separate from the American Library Association specifically for law librarianship. Small never graduated high school or attended college, yet he successfully served the Iowa State Library for over forty years. Frederick C. Hicks (1875-1956) was another early president who greatly contributed to the AALL's vision. Hicks was a law librarian at both Yale and Columbia. In 1919, Hicks was first elected president of the AALL. He served two terms as president, 1919-1920 and 1920-1921. In 1923, Hicks authored Materials and Methods of Legal Research. Prior to the publication of this book, there were very few legal research texts keeping pace with the explosive growth in casebooks and legal literature. Hicks was also a major proponent of expanding the scope of the AALL's Law Library Journal. Prior to Hicks's input, the Journal mostly served as a depository for AALL committee reports. Hicks believed an expanded Journal could cover multiple aspects of law librarianship, ranging from scholarly articles to industry news. The first woman to be elected AALL president was Rosamond Parma (1884-1946). She served two terms from 1930 to 1932. Parma was also the first law librarian for the University of California, serving as director of UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall library from 1911 to 1935. She also managed the California Law Review. A. Mercer Daniel was the first African-American member to be admitted to AALL in 1933, and was inducted into the inaugural class of the AALL Hall of Fame in 2010. Daniel faced significant discrimination, with AALL staff frequently expressing resentment at his requests for equal accommodations in travel and lodging in attending conferences throughout the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. Harry Bitner (1916-2001), who served as president for 1963-1964, helped elevate the position of law librarian from an under-educated service position to today's highly skilled specialists. Bitner outlined his thoughts in a Law Library Journal essay titled \\"The Educational Background of the University's Law Librarian\\" where he advocated college, library school, and law school degrees for new law librarians. In 1953, Bitner, along with Miles O. Price, authored Effective Legal Research. This work updated and advanced many of the themes first presented in Hick's Materials and Methods of Legal Research. As president, Bitner was instrumental in establishing a permanent headquarters for the AALL. Advocacy The AALL and its members have a long history of proactively influencing policy initiatives in the legal information field. The 1970s were the beginning of the modern era of AALL advocacy. This decade saw the association helping to provide input and shape several important policy issues such as the 1975 Federal Trade Commission's Guides for the Law Book Industry, the Copyright Act of 1976, and the 1972 and 1978 amendments to Title 44 of the United States Code. In 2013, AALL's Government Relations Office staff, along with local chapters and AALL members, held the first Local Advocate Lobby Day. This event consists of visits to House and Senate offices to raise the profile of information policy issues pertinent to the AALL. AALL took a strong position against the Federal Register Modernization Act (H.R. 4195; 113th Congress), a bill that would require the Federal Register to be published (e.g., by electronic means), rather than printed, and that documents in the Federal Register be made available for sale or distribution to the public in published form. AALL argued that the bill \\"undermines\\" citizens' \\"right to be informed\\" by making it more difficult for \\"citizens to find their government's regulations.\\" According to AALL, a survey they conducted \\"revealed that members of the public, librarians, researchers, students, attorneys, and small business owners continue to rely on the print\\" version of the Federal Register. AALL also argued that the lack of print versions of the Federal Register and CFR would mean the 15 percent of Americans who don't use the internet would lose their access to that material. Access to Legal Information. The American Association of Law Libraries has been supporting free access to Pacer information for decades. In February 2019 the AALL joined with 15 organization and signed a letter calling for passage of H.R. 6714 the Electronic Records Reform Act. In addition to requiring free access to the federal dockets and documents, the legislation directs the Administrative Office of the US Courts to consolidate the Case Management/Electronic Case Files system into a single system.https://www.aallnet.org/wp- content/uploads/2019/02/ECRRA-House-021219.pdf Additionally this year the AALL joined the American Civil Liberties Union and several other organizations on an amicus brief in response to National Veterans Legal Services Program et al v. United States of America supporting the idea that the First Amendment guarantees the public a right of access to judicial records through PACER. The case is currently before the United States Courts of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.https://www.aallnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/In-Support-of- Cross-Appellees-National-Veterans-Legal-Services-Program.pdf Publication The primary publication produced by AALL is the quarterly Law Library Journal. In 1907, Frederick W. Schenk made the recommendation for both a quarterly journal and index. The Law Library Journal has been the official publication of AALL since 1908 and contains scholarly articles on law, legal materials, legal research, and librarianship. The AALL also produces a monthly magazine, The AALL Spectrum. Furthermore, the AALL was the first publisher of the Index to Legal Periodicals, including it with the Law Library Journal beginning in 1908. Printing of the Index to Legal Periodicals was passed to the H.W. Wilson Company in April 1912, and the company assumed business management duties of the Index in 1914. The AALL publishes a monthly eNewsletter, as well as periodic eBriefings. Many current AALL publications, such as AALL Biennial Salary Survey, AALL Price Index for Legal Publications, and Guide to Fair Business Practices are focused on law librarianship advocacy. AALL also produces the Index to Foreign Legal Periodicals, an index providing multilingual coverage of foreign, international, and comparative legal journals.

Colchester in Essex, England, has a number of notable churches. Early churches Butt Road Roman Church Excavations in the 1980s for a new police station near the Maldon Road roundabout unearthed 371 Roman graves and a long narrow building. The building was built between AD 320 and 340. Oriented east to west, an apse was added to the east end in a later phase. The building was divided by a wooden screen and two rows of posts ran down the eastern half forming aisles. The building has been interpreted on strong circumstantial evidence as an early Christian church. If this is correct, it is probably the earliest known Christian church in Britain. The remains have been preserved and are visible from the public footpath. St Helen's Chapel St Helen's Chapel Dedicated to Saint Helena, the 14th-century Chronicle of Colchester states that the chapel was founded by the saint herself and refounded by Eudo Dapifer in 1076. Most of the present building dates from the 12th and 13th centuries, incorporating Roman brick. Excavations in 1981 and 1984 in Maidenburgh Street, have shown that the Roman stone and brickwork under the north and east walls were part of a theatre. In the 14th century, chantries were established in the chapel, but it was closed in 1539 after the Dissolution of St John's Abbey and it went into secular use. It became a house, a school, a library, a Quaker meeting-house and a warehouse. In the 1880s, the Round family who owned the castle, had the chapel restored by William Butterfield. After use as a clergy meeting-room and a parish hall, it was used by the Castle Museum as a store. Since 2000, it has again been used as a place of worship by the Orthodox Parish of St Helen. Medieval churches All Saints This church in High Street was declared a redundant church in 1953 and is now a Natural History Museum. It is situated opposite Colchester Castle at MapRef TL 999252. The church has a fine flint- built tower of the 15th century, while the rest of the building was extensively rebuilt in the mid 19th century. St. Botolph's Priory St Botolph's Priory The Augustinian priory of St Botolph, generally called \\"St Botolph's Priory\\", was also established in the 11th century. This adopted the Augustinian Order in around 1200 and became the mother church of the order in Britain. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries the priory church of St Botolph became the parish church. It was also used by the Corporation on civic occasions until the English Civil War. In 1650 the church was described as burnt and ruined after the Siege of Colchester, and it has been left in ruins. Until the construction of a new church in 1837, parishioners attended All Saints church instead, although burials continued in the churchyard. St Giles, St John's Green St Giles' Church Originally built on part of St John's Abbey cemetery around AD 1150, contains work from every century since. It was declared redundant in 1956 and then used as a St. John Ambulance depot until 1975 when it was converted into a masonic centre. Holy Trinity Holy Trinity is the oldest surviving church building in Colchester. It is on Trinity Street in the town centre. Parts of the church tower are Anglo-Saxon, believed to date from about 1020. The Saxon doorway in the west side of the tower has a triangular head: a feature common in Anglo-Saxon windows but unusual in a doorway. An earlier church building may have existed on the site. The churchyard includes the graves of William Gilberd, discoverer of electromagnetism and physician to Elizabeth I, and the composer John Wilbye. The Church is now a café and youth venue for arts and music. St James the Great St James the Great is a Church of England church on East Hill in Colchester. The oldest part of the church is Norman, dating from the 12th century. The nave, tower, and two aisles were built between the 13th and 15th centuries. The chancel and the Chapels of Our Lady and Saint Peter and Saint Paul were added around 1500. The radical priest John Ball, a leader of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 preached at the church. St John's Abbey The Abbey Gate The Benedictine abbey of St John the Baptist, generally known as \\"St John's Abbey,\\" founded in 1096, had a late 11th-century church until the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the execution of its abbot in 1539. Now all that remains is the gatehouse on St John's Green, which dates from the 15th century, and the church of St Giles, used as the parish church of the abbey. St Martin's St Martin's St Martin's is a 12th-century church that survives in its original Norman form. The church is on West Stockwell Street in the old Dutch Quarter. Its tower was damaged in the English Civil War and was never repaired. Today the church building is in the care of The Churches Conservation Trust and is used as a community venue. The key is available from the Colchester Borough Council museum service. St Mary-at-the-Walls On Church Street, to the east of Balkerne Hill is St Mary-at-the-Walls, built against the Roman walls and overlooking the western suburbs of the town. First recorded in 1206, the church has a notable history. It is the site where 23 Protestant martyrs were executed by burning in the reign of the Mary I. In the English Civil War a Royalist army used the church tower as a gun emplacement, which resulted in its destruction by New Model Army siege batteries. The theory that the tower gave rise to the rhyme Humpty Dumpty is now probably disproved. The lower part of the tower is Norman; the upper parts were rebuilt in 1729 and the top in 1911. The rest of the church was rebuilt in 1872 to designs by Arthur Blomfield. Philip Morant, the Essex historian, was Rector 1737–70. There was a further major rebuild in 1872 In 1978 the parish was united with Christ Church in a new building in Ireton Road. The old church was made redundant; the bell was moved to St Leonard's in Lexden and the organ to Brentwood Cathedral. In 1980 the building was reopened as Colchester Arts Centre.Colchester Arts Centre St Nicholas's Church, Colchester, with its magnificent spire St Nicholas Saint Nicholas' church formerly stood on the High Street. The original church was 12th century and the church was rebuilt in the 14th century, and restored again between 1875-76 to designs by Sir George Gilbert Scott. The church had the highest spire in Colchester. The Church of England had the church demolished in 1955 and sold the site for commercial redevelopment. The Colchester Co-operative Society built a department store (\\"St Nicholas House\\") on the site. The building has retail at the ground floor and permission for residential development on the upper floors. St Runwald's St Runwald's church is one of only three churches were ever dedicated to the Saint in Britain. The church in Colchester formerly stood as part of \\"middle row\\" in the High Street. It was demolished, along with other buildings in the row, in the 1860s. The church graveyard is in West Stockwell Street, behind Colchester Town Hall. St Peter's St Peter's on North Hill In origin a Medieval church, St Peter's is on North Hill and largely consists of later Georgian material due to a major remodelling in 1758, but the building retains mediaeval fabric and underwent a further remodelling in 1895–96. During the Medieval period the church yard contained a large stone cross from which gospels were read during the Palm Sunday procession.Ashdown-Hill, John (2009) Mediaeval Colchester's Lost Landmarks. Published by Breedon Books. () The churchyard also contained a large marker stone on its northern side into the 1500s. The Medieval church also contained a large rood screen with a rood loft. The bells are rung every Thursday. Details of its history are available at the church. St Leonard's-at-the- Hythe St Leonard's-at-the-Hythe is a large Medieval church at Colchester's Hythe river port.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=21974 retrieved 10/08/2014 Along with St John's Abbey it was one of the two ecclesiastical buildings in Colchester which contained clocks. The church was the site of a battle during the 1648 Siege of Colchester, and its south door still contains firing loops for muskets.\\"The Siege of Colchester\\" (1998) Published by Colchester Archaeology Trust. () Georgian churches Baptist Church In Eld Lane, built in 1834 on the site of Colchester's first purpose-built Baptist chapel of 1711. Strict Baptist Chapel Formerly in Stanwell Street, demolished in 1971 to make way for Colchester's Inner Ring Road. The chapel was built in 1811 or 1812 for a new congregation, some of whom had seceded from the Baptists in Eld Lane. Colchester Elim Pentecostal Church (see below) used the chapel 1957–71. Congregational Chapel This red-brick chapel in East Stockwell Street was built in 1816–17. The chapel was built for Congregational minister Rev. Joseph Herrick, who was expelled from his previous meeting house in St Helen's Lane by the Unitarians in the congregation. It was refronted in 1834 with a pediment and Tuscan columns. After Herrick's death, his successor, Rev. Thomas Batty (father of Colchester artist Dora Batty), added new schoolrooms in 1868 and remodelled the chapel in 1875. It has been a Grade II-listed building since 1971. Quaker Meeting House A Grade II listed building in Church Street dating from 1803. Victorian churches All Saints, Shrub End The parish church of Shrub End; formerly part of Lexden, it became a separate parish in 1845. Designed in a revival of Decorated Gothic by D. R. French, the red-brick church has a tower with a slated spire. MapRef TL 970232. St Botolph's St Botolph's Church The current church building was dedicated in 1837. It is built in the style of the old Norman building, with semicircular arches and Norman ornamentation and was designed by William Mason of Ipswich. The Church was nearly destroyed by fire in the 1943 air raids. It had its own team of fire watchers which dealt with several incendiary bombs. Garrison Church Built in Military Road in 1855 to hold services for soldiers going to the Crimean War, this large Grade II* listed timber church has space for a congregation of 500. It is now the Russian Orthodox Church. of St. John the Wonderworker. St James the Less This Roman Catholic Church of St James the Less and St HelenSaint James the Less and Saint Helen in Priory Street was designed by JJ Scoles, built in 1837 and enlarged in 1909–10. It is a Norman revival building with an apsidal chancel. St John the Evangelist The Church of St John the Evangelist Colchester was built in 1863 by Arthur Blomfield in the Decorated style. It is principally of red brick with yellow and blue brick and stone window tracery. It consists of a chancel and nave surmounted by a small bellcot at the west end. The chancel and its fittings and part of the nave were built with money collected in memory of J.T. Round. It has a boarded and tiled roof. In the late 1960s and into the 1970s, the modern housing estate of St John’s was built and a further estate of Highwoods was developed in the 1980s. From 1980 under the leadership of Rev Brian Nicholson, the numbers of the congregation steadily grew. Mainly through the generous giving from the church family, the church was significantly extended in 1987. Following continuing growth in church membership, St Luke’s was planted, meeting weekly in the community centre on Highwoods. In 2012 the church undertook a million pound plus building project, replacing our old pre- fab church hall with a new multi purpose Community Centre. United Reformed Church In Lion Walk, this Gothic Revival church was designed in a Geometrical Decorated Gothic style and built in 1863 for a Congregational community that had been meeting in Colchester since the 17th century. The 1884 Colchester earthquake damaged its steeple. The church became part of the new United Reformed Church in 1972. Modern churches St Barnabas' Church, Old Heath Built on the site of a Victorian church, St Barnabas was built in 1949 to replace the original church which was in a state of disrepair. A small and friendly church, it has various services and masses during the week including a Parish Sung Mass on a Sunday Morning at 10am. Castle Methodist Church In Maidenburgh Street next to Colchester Castle, this 20th-century building was opened in 1970 on the site of the \\"great round meeting house\\" where John Wesley preached in the 18th century. A wooden pulpit that he used is preserved in the new church. Colchester New Church Colchester New Church Colchester New Church at 175 Maldon Road was built in 1924. In 1967 the church building was expanded. The sanctuary was extended two metres in length, a new school room, and a new entrance porch were added. The designer of the new additions was architect Geoff P. Dawson. Elim Pentecostal Church Colchester's Elim Pentecostal congregation formed in 1930. A temporary tabernacle was built in Fairfax Road in 1931 and served until 1957, when the congregation moved to the former Strict Baptist Chapel in Stanwell Street (see above). When that chapel was demolished in 1971 to make way for a new road, the congregation had a new church built in Walsingham Road. The congregation now meets in a newer building on Clematis Way.Elim Colchester Greenstead Evangelical Free Church Greenstead Evangelical Free Church is on Magnolia Drive on the Greenstead estate.

She served as a commissioned ship for 2 years and 4 months. Artemis (AKA-21) was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1882) on 23 November 1943 at Providence, R.I., by the Walsh-Kaiser Co., Inc.; launched on 20 May 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Thomas J. Walsh; acquired by the Navy from the Maritime Commission on 28 August 1944; and placed in commission that same day, Lt. Comdr. Thomas J. Rattray in command. Service history 1944 After fitting out at Boston, Mass., the attack cargo ship proceeded to the Chesapeake Bay for shakedown training. She then sailed to the naval supply depot at Bayonne, N.J., to embark naval passengers and supplies for transportation to the Pacific. The ship got underway on 12 October and transited the Panama Canal on the 17th. On that same date, she reported to Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet, and continued on toward the west coast. She reached San Diego, California, on the 26th and remained in port for one day. The vessel then shaped a course for Hawaii. Artemis reached Pearl Harbor on 3 November and unloaded her passengers. One day later, she left Hawaiian waters to return to California. On 13 November, the ship arrived at Port Hueneme to take on pontoon equipment and carried this cargo to Pearl Harbor. While in Hawaii, she participated in a series of training exercises held off Pearl Harbor. On 5 December, Artemis left Hawaiian waters to return to the west coast. Once again, cargo was taken on at Port Hueneme, and the ship proceeded back to Hawaii, and Artemis spent the Christmas holidays in port at Pearl Harbor. 1945 On 4 January 1945, she proceeded to Kahului, Maui, to embark marines. The vessel got underway on 12 January with units of Task Force (TF) 51 for amphibious training exercises off Maui and arrived back at Pearl Harbor on the 18th. Nine days later, she sailed for Eniwetok with Task Group 53.2. After spending two days at that atoll, Artemis got underway to participate in the invasion of the Volcano Islands. Steaming via Saipan, the ship anchored in Transport Area \\"Baker\\" off the southeast coast of Iwo Jima on 19 February. She then sent her boats to assist the transports during the initial assault. The attack cargo ship remained in the area through the 27th discharging troops and cargo and taking casualties on board during the day and retiring out to sea each night. Artemis touched back at Saipan on 3 March. Three days later, she got underway for Ulithi and remained in port there during the next three weeks to resupply and undergo minor repairs. On 29 March, the vessel paused at Manus before getting underway for New Caledonia. She arrived at Noumea on 4 April where she took on passengers and cargo before sailing on 3 May for Leyte, Philippine Islands. The vessel reached Leyte on 16 May and began unloading operations the next day. Artemis headed for New Guinea on the 30th and touched at Hollandia on 3 June. Two days later, she moved to Oro Bay to take on cargo and troops. The ship sailed for the Philippines on 9 June, discharged her cargo at Manila, and then sailed to the Admiralty Islands. After pausing at Manus to refuel, Artemis proceeded to Lae, New Guinea, to pick up more troops and cargo. The loading was completed on 3 July, and the vessel got underway to return to the Philippines. She unloaded at Manila in mid-July before proceeding to Tacloban, Philippine Islands, to pick up troops and equipment for transportation to Hawaii. Artemis sailed eastward on 31 July and reached Pearl Harbor two weeks later. She was discharging her cargo there when word of the Japanese capitulation was announced on 15 August. The vessel entered drydock at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard on the 24th for overhaul. This work was completed in mid-September, and she embarked occupation troops for transportation to the Japanese home islands. On 3 October, Artemis moored at Yokosuka, Japan, and began discharging her passengers. She operated in Japanese waters until 24 November, when she set a course for the west coast of the United States. The vessel reached San Francisco, California, on 10 December and, ten days later, set out for the Philippines. Upon her arrival at Samar, Artemis embarked military personnel for transport back to the United States. 1946 She got underway on 21 January 1946 and made San Francisco on 9 February. The ship remained in port there until 20 March, when she headed for Hawaii. Upon her arrival at Pearl Harbor, the ship conducted logistic support operations for nearby naval activities until 15 May, when she was assigned to Joint Task Force 1 to support \\"Operation Crossroads,\\" tests conducted at Bikini Atoll to learn of the effects of atomic bomb explosions upon warships. This assignment occupied the cargo ship through mid-August when she returned to Pearl Harbor and resumed local operations. On 6 November, Artemis departed Hawaiian waters and shaped a course for the west coast. She reached San Francisco one week later, but left that port on the 23rd and proceeded to the Panama Canal Zone. After retransiting the canal, the ship continued on to Norfolk, Va., where she was decommissioned on 10 January 1947. Decommissioning Her name was struck from the Navy list on 25 February 1947.

He played college football at Texas A&M; University. Early years Childress attended J. J. Pearce High School, where he was an All-state defensive tackle. He accepted a football scholarship from Texas A&M; University. He became a star as a freshman at defensive tackle. As a junior, he posted 117 tackles, 15 quarterback sacks (school record) and was named First-team All-American. As a senior, he anchored an Aggie defense that ranked No. 5 nationally in pass defense (127.5 yards per game). He recorded 124 tackles and 10 sacks. His 25 career sacks was then a school record for a non- linebacker and his 360 tackles then ranked fourth on A&M;'s career list. He was a consensus All-American selection. Childress ranks fifth all-time at the university in both career tackles and career sacks. In 1990, he was inducted into the Texas A&M; Athletic Hall of Fame. In 2008, he was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. In 2010, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Professional career Houston Oilers Childress was considered one of the top prospects in the 1985 NFL draft and was in serious consideration for the first-overall selection; the Buffalo Bills, who held the pick, ultimately chose another defensive end, eventual Hall of Famer Bruce Smith. Childress slipped to third overall, where he was selected by the Houston Oilers. He shares the NFL record for fumble recoveries in a single game, having recovered three from the Washington Redskins on October 30, 1988. After five seasons as the Oilers' defensive end, Childress moved to defensive tackle in 1990 when defensive coordinator Jim Eddy switched from a 3-4 defense to a 4-3 scheme, necessitating an extra lineman. Childress was already a Pro Bowl end and had even filled in at nose guard on occasion. After the move, he would end up as a Pro Bowl selection in Hawaii four more times as a defensive tackle. As a testament to his excellence, four of the eight lowest single- season rushing totals allowed in Oilers history came between 1990 and 1993, with Childress at tackle. Childress was as effective against the pass as he was against the run. He finished his Oiler career ranked second all-time in quarterback sacks and sixth all-time in tackles, joining Elvin Bethea as the only defensive linemen among the Oilers' top 10 in both categories. Childress led or shared the team sack lead from 1986–1989 and finished with the most single-season sacks for a defensive tackle (13) in 1992. For his 11-year career, Childress registered 13 multi-sack games. He was known by his fans as not only as a star, but also as a blue-collar iron man. Until a separated shoulder ended his 1995 season (an injury that would thereafter be the determining factor in his decision to retire), he missed only 3 non-strike games due to injury, playing 154 games along the defensive line from 1985–1994. On February 15, 1996, he was released in a salary-cap move. Childress may be best remembered for coming up with huge plays at crucial moments of games. He had an incredible seven fumble recoveries in 1988, two shy of the NFL single-season record. Three of those came in the Oilers' memorable 41-17 whipping of the Redskins, broadcast on ESPN October 30, 1988. Childress was the foundation of a remarkable defensive unit that saw Houston make seven consecutive playoff appearances. During the prime of his career, he was considered by many to be the best defensive tackle in football. Dallas Cowboys On December 4, 1996, he was signed as a free agent by the Dallas Cowboys, to replace a suspended Leon Lett. He was a reserve player for 3 games behind Tony Casillas and Chad Hennings. He wasn't re-signed after the season. Philanthropy Along with his wife, Kara, Childress established the Childress Foundation in Houston, Texas in 1992. The foundation provides programs to enhance student success, promote productive citizenship through community service, and develop effective life skills. Since its inception, the Childress Foundation has provided over $1.7 million in college scholarships and has benefited more than 1,300 students. Personal life Following his 12-year career in the NFL, Childress served as chairman and CEO for ten years of the Ray Childress Auto Group and a limited partner in the NFL franchise, Houston Texans. RCAG operated the Lawrence Marshall auto dealerships in Houston, Texas and the small town of Hempstead, Texas, approximately fifty miles from Houston. Lawrence Marshall dealerships closed on February 4, 2009. The corporation closing can apparently be traced back to the national credit crunch when General Motors and Chrysler Corporation filed for bankruptcy. He also founded the Childress Directional Drilling, LLC.

It has about 5,000 inhabitants. It lies on the River Radbuza, some south-west of the region capital Plzeň. History A settlement on the right bank of the Radbuza river was first established in the mid-13th century, on land owned by the archbishops of Prague. The town was besieged and defended during the Hussite wars between 1422 and 1431. The German Elector John, Count Palatine of Neumarkt (Johann von Pfalz-Neumarkt) helped relieve the town. After the death of Louis II of Hungary at the Battle of Mohács in 1526, Archduke Ferdinand of Austria became King of Bohemia and the country became a constituent state of the Habsburg Monarchy to 1918. After 1539 Bischofteinitz belonged to the House of Lobkowicz. After the Thirty Years War the town passed to the counts on Trauttmansdorff, in whose possession the castle remained until 1945. Bischofteinitz developed into an important, if minor, provincial centre bordering Bavaria. During the late 19th century and especially after 1918 Czechs began moving into the district in large numbers. In 1938 the town and region were annexed into Nazi Germany as part of the Sudetenland. From 1938 to 1945 it was, as Bischofteinitz, one of the municipalities in Sudetenland. Until 1945 the area was populated by native Germans who spoke a Northern Bavarian dialect (Nordbairisch). These people were expelled by the Beneš decrees following World War II. On 1 December 1930 Horšovský Týn had 3,117 inhabitants; on 17 May 1939 there were 2,995 inhabitants and on 22 May 1947 2,393 inhabitants. Sights The main attraction is a castle that was rebuilt in 1547 by Agostino Galli. Much of the original Gothic castle, the palace portals and some rooms have been preserved.

He is said to have been born in the barony of Leyney, in present-day Co. Sligo. In the 17th century, John Colgan compiled a Latin Life of St Cormac, published in the Acta Sanctorum Hiberniae series, which relates that Cormac left his native Munster for Connacht and arrived in the area of Leyney. When Niall, the brother of the local chieftain Diarmait, begged the saint for a blessing, Cormac revealed that he was to have a son by the name of Conamel, whose descendants would include a number of illustrious saints, such as Náth Í \\"the priest\\". In the Martyrology of Donegal (9 August), he is described as the priest (cruimthir) Nath Í of Achad Cain Conairi. He is said to have studied under St Finnián of Clonard. On the instructions of his mentor, he founded a monastery in Achad Cain or Achad Conaire (Achonry) in the district of the Luigne, the land having been granted to him by Cennfáelad, king of Luigne. The foundation gave its name to what in the 12th century would become the diocese of Achonry. The saint Féchín of Fore is said to have studied under him. The Book of Lismore (fo. 43v) contains a short Irish anecdote relating what happened when Nath Í, called Dathi the Priest, was once visited by the saints Columba, Comgall and Cainnech after the monastic community had finished their meals.Whitley Stokes, Lives of Saints from the Book of Lismore (1890), p. xv (preface). He was buried in Achad Cain and his festival is 9 August. He is the patron saint of the Irish diocese of Achonry whose cathedral is The Cathedral Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Nathy.

She completed work on her Bachelor of Arts degree two years after she dropped out to act full-time. Career Weston's Broadway credits include Toys in the Attic, A Far Country, and Mary, Mary. Her first notable television role was a stint as Robin Fletcher on Guiding Light from 1963 to 1964, followed by another daytime role as Karen Gregory on Another World. In 1979 she appeared as Derek's ex-wife on The Young and the Restless. Weston portrayed Betty Harrelson in S.W.A.T. and Dr. Steele in Get Smart. She also appeared in The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, Bewitched, Bonanza, Wonder Woman, and The Bob Newhart Show, and television movies such as Letters from Three Lovers (1973), Miracle on 34th Street (1973), The Questor Tapes (1974) and Revenge of the Stepford Wives (1980). Weston's only feature film was Dangerous Relations. In 1971, she appeared in the TV serie \\"Mannix\\", Season 4-Episode 18, \\"The Crime That Wasn't\\", as Mrs Coverly. In 1972, Weston co-wrote seven songs with singer Lesley Gore for Gore's MoWest debut album Someplace Else Now. Weston's first writing job was as a staff writer for the CBS soap opera Capitol. She was hired to write made- for-TV movies, including Lies Before Kisses, See Jane Run, The Disappearance of Vonnie, and the 1999 movie As The Beat Goes On: The Sonny and Cher Story. She was a producer for several of the movies. In 2003, John Conboy, executive producer of Guiding Light hired Weston, who had worked for him on The Young and the Restless and Capitol, as the head writer. Weston's central story was the Maryanne Carruthers mystery. The story brought actress Carrie Nye, a friend of Weston, back to the show. The story was criticized for its resemblance to a similar plot that Guiding Light had broadcast twenty years earlier, and for the substantial revisions to history that the story made for five main characters.

Such persons may help individuals deal with issues associated with addiction and substance abuse; family, parenting, and marital problems; stress management; self-esteem; and aging. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics distinguishes \\"Mental Health Counselors\\" from \\"Social Workers\\", \\"Psychiatrists\\", and \\"Psychologists\\".  Duties The legal definition of a counselor, and hence the legal scope of practice, varies with jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions across the United States, counselors, marriage and family therapists, and psychologists have virtually identical definitions: evaluating and treating mental and behavioral disorders.http://unlicensed- practitioner.com/whats-difference-counselor-psychologist/ In spite of such definitions, many mental health professionals reject the medical model (which assumes that clients are \\"disordered\\") in favor of broader viewpoints, such as those that emerged from systems psychology. Service users MHCs work with individuals, couples, families, and groups to address and treat emotional and mental disorders and to promote mental health. Most mental health counselors in the U.S. work in outpatient and residential care centers, individual and family services, and local governments. They are trained in a variety of therapeutic techniques used to address issues, including depression, anxiety, addiction and substance abuse, suicidal impulses, stress, problems with self- esteem, and grief. They also help with job and career concerns, educational decisions, issues related to mental and emotional health, and family, parenting, marital, or other relationship problems. Some career concerns include helping employees who have mental health conditions to manage their health condition whilst adhering to organisational demands to demonstrate performance and commitment to their work.Elraz, H. (2018). Identity, mental health and work: How employees with mental health conditions recount stigma and the pejorative discourse of mental illness. Human Relations, 71(5), 722-741. doi:http://dx.doi.org.libaccess.lib.mcmaster.ca/10.1177/0018726717716752 MHCs also continue to play a growing role in the military mental health crisis, helping military personnel and their families deal with issues such as PTSD. MHCs often work closely with other mental health specialists, such as psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, psychiatric nurses, and school counselors. Many mental health counselors look to help their clients have a concise whole body treatment plan that addresses all the needs of the client. In the United States, MHCs diagnose as well as treat mental illness,Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-09 Edition, United States Bureau of Labor Statistics though the scope of practice for mental health practitioners varies from state to state. Regulation United States Licensing requirements can vary depending on which state a mental health counselor practices in. Across the United States, mental health counseling licensure is required to independently practice, but can be practiced without a license if under close supervision of a licensed practitioner. Licensing titles for mental health counselors vary from state to state: Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC), Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC), Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor (LPCC), and various forms of these titles may list differently per state statues. The title \\"Mental Health Counselor\\" (or variation thereof) is often a protected title and thus it may be a violation of state law for persons to hold themselves as such without a proper credential. A licensed mental health counselor holds a minimum of a master's degree in counseling or another closely related field in mental health care. After obtaining a master's degree, mental health counselors complete two to three years (depending on various state statutes) of clinical work under the supervision of a licensed or certified mental health professional. The qualifications for licensure are similar to those for marriage and family therapists and for clinical social workers. Becoming a counselor and using it in daily life to help others to learn more about themselves is not a reason for someone to pursue a degree within this field. Ethics within this profession require the counselor to remain professional to be able to adequately treat patients. Remaining detached as the witness to a client's thought, feelings, and emotions can be a hard thing to do, but will ultimately reassure a patient that there are no judgement to what they will share.Ethics in Psychology and the Mental Health Professions: Standards and Cases Guiding a patient to understand themselves and their choices is also another aspect of this profession.

Biography Son of a pharmacist, Arnaud was born on November 17, 1915 in Bourg-en-Bresse. After studying in Dijon in the Lyceum Carnot, he opted for the military career and went in 1935 to the École Spéciale Militaire de Saint- Cyr, the foremost French military academy. Arnaud had chosen to enter in the colonial infantry, and when Charles de Gaulle issued the Appeal of June 18 in 1940 for resistance against the Axis, he was a lieutenant stationed at Faya- Largeau in Chad and attached to the Régiment de Tirailleurs Sénégalais du Tchad (RTST), and on 26 August sided with de Gaulle, like all soldiers of the RTST. He participated to Philippe Leclerc's offensive against Italian positions in Libya, but was badly wounded near Kufra on 8 February 1941, and sent to hospital first at Yaoundé and then at Beirut. In January 1942 he entered in the staff of General Georges Catroux, head of the Free French Forces in the Middle East, and was promoted Captain in June. In 1943 he was again put under the orders of Leclerc, and under his command was to remain till the end of the war. For his old wound till 1 December 1944; having after asked to return to field duty, he was assigned to the Régiment du March de Tchad (RMT), the new name of the RTST. After 1945, Arnaud took part to the First Indochina War, and in the 1960s was promoted first Colonel and then Brigade General. In 1969 Arnaud returned to Chad as commander of Opération Bison, a military operation that had to contain the menace represented to the Chadian government by the FROLINAT rebels; but tensions with the Chadian President brought to his replacement just a few months after his arrival. After that, Arnaud held several other positions, until he was made Corps General in 1974. He died on 1 August 1990 at Frejus, and is buried at Grenoble.

He ordered the construction of the chapel of Santa Bàrbara in 1617. History Vallfogona in 1916 The first historical reference to Vallfogona records the founding of the parish in 1123 after its reconquest from the Moors, who had called it Vall d'Alfes. The town was a fief of the noble house of the Counts of Queralt. By 1150, the local lord, Gombau d'Oluja, had occupied the site of Vallfogona and had repopulated the area with Christian Catalans. He laid out the town, building a small castle and beginning construction on the town's Romanesque church, both of which still stand. On his death in 1191, Gombau ceded Vallfogona to the Knights Templar. When the Temple was suppressed in 1312, Vallfogona came under control of the Knights Hospitaller. In 1416 the Hospitallers reconstructed much of the church and castle. Vallfogona's first tourist facility, the Fonda Dolores, opened in 1870 to serve visitors to the spring and its medicinal waters. During the Spanish Civil War (1936–39), the hotels at the spa served as a hospital for wounded Republican soldiers. About 100 casualties were buried in a mass grave in the cemetery. Three men, all conservatives, were shot by leftist forces at the beginning of the conflict. Eleven soldiers from Vallfogona died in the fighting, all on the Republican side. The Francoist victors did not execute any Vallfogonins, but at least five of them were imprisoned and several had to flee to France. Vallfogona lost nearly 20% of its population. Vallfogona de Riucorb became part of the Conca de Barberà in the comarcal reorganization of 1990: previously it had formed part of the Segarra. On July 10, 2010, the newly restored Romanesque sculpture of Saint Peter \\"dels Vigues\\" was unveiled; it had been pulled down from the roof of Vallfogona's parish church by anarchists during the Spanish Civil War, and broken up. The restored statue is inside the church, and a copy was made and placed in the statue's original position on the roof above the front door. Economy Vallfogona depends economically on agriculture and tourism. It forms part of the officially recognized Costers del Segre wine region; other crops are olives, almonds, wheat, and barley. A spa-hotel complex was constructed in the early 20th century to take advantage of the spring's waters and attract visitors. Today Vallfogona has two hotels and a restaurant. Additionally, it has an attractive public swimming pool-bar open during the summer months, popular among the locals. The forests to the south and southeast of Vallfogona are mostly pine and oak. Transportation The village is linked to Guimerà and to Santa Coloma de Queralt by the L-241/T-241/T-224 road. It is served by a twice-daily bus service between Barcelona and Guimerà, and a daily service between Vallfogona and Tàrrega. A track connects Vallfogona with the naturist village of El Fonoll.

Biography The band was formed in 1994 by keyboardist Piotr Kopeć. The first line-up consisted of Adrian Kowanek (vocals), Piotr Stepkowski (guitar), Marcin Bochajewski (guitar), Michal Nasiadka (bass guitar), and Pawel Wegrzyn (drums). Their first effort, Painful Love, was released in 1995 by the label Croon Records; its songs could be described as doom metal with lyrics dealing with love. In 1997 Atrophia Red Sun recorded their second album, Fears, a different album both musically and lyrically — it is a personal and in some ways pessimistic view of the world. Musically, the band had turned from doom metal to more progressive sounds. 1998 and 1999 brought many changes as the band was abandoned by both guitarists and a bass player, and it wasn't until 2001 that they started rehearsing once again with a full line-up. In 2001 and 2002 Atrophia Red Sun recorded a promo and a demo, and in 2003 they released Twisted Logic, their third full-length album. The band took a year off in 2005. On October 29, 2007, the tour bus for fellow Polish death metal band Decapitated was involved in an accident with a truck carrying wood in Gomel, on the Russia/Belarus border. Both Witold Kieltyka (also known as Vitek) and Adrian Kowanek (who was the vocalist for that band at the time) were seriously injured. While it was initially believed that they were taken to Moscow to be treated after treatment at a local hospital, it was later confirmed that they were only taken to be treated in Novozybkov, where they have remained for the time being. On November 2, 2007, Vitek died from his injuries from the accident. He was 23 years old. Covan has since shown slow but progressive signs of improvement. Covan's family released a short update in October 2008 concerning his improving condition. In 2008, Kowanek left Decapitated and disbanded Atrophia Red Sun due to his slow recovery. As a result from the accident, he had reportedly suffered from cardiac arrest and cerebral hypoxia, which left him paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair.

It is defined by: :q \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ -\\\\frac{\\\\ddot{a} a }{\\\\dot{a}^2} where a is the scale factor of the universe and the dots indicate derivatives by proper time. The expansion of the universe is said to be \\"accelerating\\" if \\\\ddot{a} > 0 (recent measurements suggest it is), and in this case the deceleration parameter will be negative. The minus sign and name \\"deceleration parameter\\" are historical; at the time of definition \\\\ddot{a} was expected to be negative, so a minus sign was inserted in the definition to make q positive in that case. Since the evidence for the accelerating universe in the 1998–2003 era, it is now believed that \\\\ddot{a} is positive therefore the present-day value q_0 is negative (though q was positive in the past before dark energy became dominant). In general q varies with cosmic time, except in a few special cosmological models; the present-day value is denoted q_0. The Friedmann acceleration equation can be written as :\\\\frac{\\\\ddot{a}}{a} =-\\\\frac{4 \\\\pi G}{3} \\\\sum_i (\\\\rho_i +\\\\frac{3\\\\,p_i}{c^2})= -\\\\frac{4\\\\pi G}{3} \\\\sum_i \\\\rho_i (1 + 3 w_i), where the sum i extends over the different components, matter, radiation and dark energy, \\\\rho_i is the equivalent mass density of each component, p_i is its pressure, and w_i = p_i/(\\\\rho_i c^2) is the equation of state for each component. The value of w_i is 0 for non- relativistic matter (baryons and dark matter), 1/3 for radiation, and −1 for a cosmological constant; for more general dark energy it may differ from −1, in which case it is denoted w_{DE} or simply w . Defining the critical density as : \\\\rho_{c} = \\\\frac{3 H^2}{8 \\\\pi G} and the density parameters \\\\Omega_i \\\\equiv \\\\rho_i / \\\\rho_c , substituting \\\\rho_i = \\\\Omega_i\\\\,\\\\rho_c in the acceleration equation gives :q= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum \\\\Omega_i (1+3w_i) = \\\\Omega_{rad}(z) +\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\Omega_m(z) + \\\\frac{1+3w_{DE} }{2} \\\\Omega_{DE}(z) \\\\ . where the density parameters are at the relevant cosmic epoch. At the present day \\\\Omega_{rad} \\\\sim 10^{-4} is negligible, and if w_{DE} = -1 (cosmological constant) this simplifies to : q_0 = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\Omega_m - \\\\Omega_\\\\Lambda . where the density parameters are present-day values; this evaluates to q_0 \\\\approx -0.55 for the parameters estimated from the Planck spacecraft data. (Note that the CMB, as a high-redshift measurement, does not directly measure q_0; but its value can be inferred by fitting cosmological models to the CMB data, then calculating q_0 from the other measured parameters as above). The time derivative of the Hubble parameter can be written in terms of the deceleration parameter: :\\\\frac{\\\\dot{H}}{H^2}=-(1+q). Except in the speculative case of phantom energy (which violates all the energy conditions), all postulated forms of mass-energy yield a deceleration parameter q \\\\geqslant -1. Thus, any non-phantom universe should have a decreasing Hubble parameter, except in the case of the distant future of a Lambda-CDM model, where q will tend to −1 from above and the Hubble parameter will asymptote to a constant value of H_0 \\\\sqrt{\\\\Omega_\\\\Lambda} . The above results imply that the universe would be decelerating for any cosmic fluid with equation of state w greater than -\\\\tfrac{1}{3} (any fluid satisfying the strong energy condition does so, as does any form of matter present in the Standard Model, but excluding inflation). However observations of distant type Ia supernovae indicate that q is negative; the expansion of the universe is accelerating. This is an indication that the gravitational attraction of matter, on the cosmological scale, is more than counteracted by the negative pressure of dark energy, in the form of either quintessence or a positive cosmological constant. Before the first indications of an accelerating universe, in 1998, it was thought that the universe was dominated by matter with negligible pressure, w \\\\approx 0. This implied that the deceleration parameter would be equal to \\\\Omega_m/2 , e.g. q_0 = 1/2 for a universe with \\\\Omega_m = 1 or q_0 \\\\sim 0.1 for a low-density zero-Lambda model. The experimental effort to discriminate these cases with supernovae actually revealed negative q_0 \\\\sim -0.6 \\\\pm 0.2 , evidence for cosmic acceleration, which has subsequently grown stronger.

In 1522 year the Vievis manor, in 1539 year - town, which belonged to Ogiński family, was mentioned. In the first half of 16th century the first Catholic church was built there. About 1600, Ogiński family built a Uniate church and founded the Abbey of the Holy Spirit (Lithuanian: Šventosios dvasios). At the beginning of the 17th century a printing press was established near the abbey, notable for printing books by various Protestant Calvinist scholars. An 1843 Eastern Orthodox Church in Vievis In 1794 and 1812, the church burned down and was rebuilt in 1816. In 1837 an Orthodox church was built. In the period between World War I and World War II, Vievis was near the dividing line between Lithuania and Poland. The town used to be among those with the largest Polish population, with roughly 77% inhabitants identifying themselves as Poles. In 2011 census, only 10.9% of inhabitants identified themselves as Poles as well as 3.74% Russians and 82.56% Lithuanians. The 17th century printing press became the reason why a 1970s samizdat journal \\"Lustra dzion\\" edited by Vincuk Viačorka cited \\"Jewie\\" as the place of its publishing (even though it was in fact published in Minsk).

Life He established a monastery and school in the area now known as Rosscarbery towards the end of the sixth century. His monastery became the principal monastery of west Cork, and later had a famous Scripture school known as the School of Ross. Brendan, the Navigator, taught in this school, which was crowded by students from every land.O'Halloran, W. Early Irish History and Antiquities and the History of West Cork, 1916 It flourished for three hundred years and survived in some form until the coming of the Normans to Ireland. It was the centre from which the Diocese of Ross developed. Fachtna, born at a place called Tulachteann, was one of the pupils of Saint Ita and studied at Saint Finbarr's school at Loch Eirce (Gougane Barra). Before establishing the monastic school of Ross, he founded the monastery of Molana on an island in the Blackwater, near Youghal.Mervyn Archdall, Monasticum Hibernicum ; or an History of the Abbies, Priories, and other Religious Houses in Ireland (Dublin, 1786), vol. 1, pp. 142–144; reproduced also in Irish Ecclesiastical Record, Vol VII, 1871, pp. 485-488 In some Latin documents he is called Fachtna Facundus (Fachtna the Eloquent) and even spoken of as Sanctus Facundus. In Irish records he is generally referred to as Mac Mongach (Hairy Child), because he was reported to have been born with his head covered with hair. The interpretation of this phrase by James Ussher and others as meaning Son of Mongach was rejected by Mervyn Archdall. The description of Saint Fachtna in Cuimin of Connor's poem on the characteristic virtues of the Irish saints is: :Fachtna, the generous and steadfast, loved :To instruct the crowds in concert, :He never spoke that which was mean, :Nor aught but what was pleasing to his Lord. Mention is made of Fachtna and Conall of Ros Ailithir within the scholia of the Félire Óengusso in connection with Ciarán of Saigir the Elder who was born and raised on Cape Clear Island.

Its wood was hard and difficult to work, used for war and peace, for domestic vessels and door posts, for spears and shields. It had to be treated with care because its berries are toxic. The name Eoghan then already had a religious significance in pagan Ireland.Devlin PP, Rev. Kieran. \\"Saint Eugene, Patron of the Diocese\\", Derry Diocese Life Eogan was born in Leinster. According to his Vita, Eoghan was born the son of Cainneach and Muindeacha. His mother is said to have been of the Mugdorna of south-east Ulster. These people seem to have had some contact with the Laighin (who gave their name to Leinster), to whom his father Cainneach belonged. Since this is the area where Christianity first reached Ireland it may well be that Eoghan's father's family had been Christian for some time. As a boy he studied at Clones, and it was from there that he was carried off to Britain by pirates, and subsequently he was taken captive to Brittany, together with Cairbre of Coleraine and St. Tighernach, who is best known as the founder of the abbey of Clones, Co. Monaghan. On obtaining his freedom, he went to study at St. Ninian's Candida Casa. Others said to have studied with Ninian include Finnian of Moville. He may also have spent some time in Brittany (Armorica).Duffy, Patrick. \\"Saint Eoghan or Eugene of Ardstraw 6th century (Patron of Derry Diocese)\\", Catholic Ireland, 23 August 2012 Returning to Ireland, he made a foundation at Kilnamanagh, in the Wicklow hills. After presiding over the Abbey of Kilnamanagh (Co. Wicklow) for fifteen years, he settled in the valley of Mourne (Co. Tyrone), his mother's country, about the year 576. It is reasonable to assume that Eoghan came north not just as a missionary to pagans, but also ‘as a pilgrim for the sake of Christ’ in exile. It was not necessary to go abroad to do this. Due to the division of Ireland into a grid of independent states or tuatha, exile meant leaving one’s own and taking one’s chances in another tuath. Without personal resources one had no honour or personal standing outside one’s own tuath. He was followed by many disciples including his kinsman, St. Kevin of Glendalough, who completed his studies under this saint.O'Hanlon, John. Lives of the Irish Saints, Vol. VIII, \\"August 23\\", James Duffy and Sons, Dublin So great was the fame of the sanctity and learning of St. Eoghan, at Mourne, that he was consecrated first Bishop of Ardstraw about the year 581. His Vita contains a number of miracle stories. While going through the forest Craoibheach (modern day Cruagh, a townland near Wicklow) he sang fifty psalms and when his attendant answered \\"Amen\\" at the end of the Lord's Prayer the trees all around also answered \\"Amen\\". It also mentions his close relations with Tighernach of Clones and Cairbre of Coleraine, which might indicate an alliance of monasteries threatened by the dominance of Armagh. It is difficult to give his chronology with any degree of exactness, but the Irish annalists give the date of his death as 23 Aug. 618. His name is generally Latinized as Eugenius, but the Irish form is Eoghan (Owen). Veneration St. Eoghan is the patron saint of the See of Derry. His feast is celebrated on 23 August.

Subtilisins belong to subtilases, a group of serine proteases that – like all serine proteases – initiate the nucleophilic attack on the peptide (amide) bond through a serine residue at the active site. Subtilisins typically have molecular weights 27kDa. They can be obtained from certain types of soil bacteria, for example, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens from which they are secreted in large amounts.

It is the type serine endopeptidase of MEROPS family S8.  Structure  The structure of subtilisin has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The mature form is a 275-residue globular protein with several alpha-helices, and a large beta-sheet. The N-terminal contains an I9 propetide domain () that assists the folding of subtilisin. Proteolytic removal of the domain activates the enzyme. It is structurally unrelated to the chymotrypsin-clan of serine proteases, but uses the same type of catalytic triad in the active site. This makes it a classic example of convergent evolution.  Mechanism of catalysis  The active site features a charge- relay network involving Asp-32, His-64, and active site Ser-221 arranged in a catalytic triad. The charge-relay network functions as follows: The carboxylate side-chain of Asp-32 hydrogen-bonds to a nitrogen-bonded proton on His-64's imidazole ring. This is possible because Asp is negatively charged at physiological pH. The other nitrogen on His-64 hydrogen-bonds to the O-H proton of Ser-221. This last interaction results in charge-separation of O-H, with the oxygen atom being more nucleophilic. This allows the oxygen atom of Ser-221 to attack incoming substrates (i.e., peptide bonds), assisted by a neighboring carboxyamide side-chain of Asn-155. Even though Asp-32, His-64, and Ser-221 are sequentially far apart, they converge in the 3D structure to form the active site. To summarize the interactions described above, Ser-221 acts as a nucleophile and cleaves peptide bonds with its partially negative oxygen atom. This is possible due to the nature of the charge-relay site of subtilisin.  Applications   Research tool  In molecular biology using B. subtilis as a model organism, the gene encoding subtilisin (aprE) is often the second gene of choice after amyE for integrating reporter constructs into, due to its dispensability.  Commercial  Protein-engineered subtilisins are widely used in commercial products (the native enzyme is easily inactivated by detergents and high temperatures) and is also called a stain cutter, for example, in laundry and dishwashing detergents, cosmetics, food processing, skin care ointments, contact lens cleaners, and for research in synthetic organic chemistry.  Occupational safety and health  People can be exposed to subtilisin in the workplace by breathing it in, swallowing it, skin contact, and eye contact. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.00006 mg/m3 over a 60-minute period. Subtilisin can cause \\"enzymatic detergent asthma\\". People who are sensitive to Subtilisin (Alcalase) usually are also allergic to the bacteria Bacillus subtilis.

An employee of NASA since its creation in 1958, Lunney was a flight director during the Gemini and Apollo programs, and was on duty during historic events such as the Apollo 11 lunar ascent and the pivotal hours of the Apollo 13 crisis. At the end of the Apollo program, he became manager of the Apollo- Soyuz Test Project, the first collaboration in spaceflight between the United States and the Soviet Union. Later, he served as manager of the Space Shuttle program before leaving NASA in 1985 and later becoming a vice president of the United Space Alliance. Lunney was a key figure in the US manned space program from Project Mercury through the coming of the Space Shuttle. He has received numerous awards for his work, including the National Space Trophy, which he was given by the Rotary Club in 2005. Chris Kraft, NASA's first flight director, described Lunney as \\"a true hero of the space age\\", saying that he was \\"one of the outstanding contributors to the exploration of space of the last four decades\\". Early life and NACA career Glynn Stephen Lunney grew up in the coal city of Old Forge, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, the eldest son of William Lunney, a welder and former miner who encouraged his son to get an education and to find a job beyond the mines. He graduated from the Scranton Preparatory School in 1953.Conor Foley, \\"Apollo 13 Flight Director Wins Prep Alumni Award\\" The Times-Tribune, October 5, 2009 A childhood interest in model airplanes prompted Lunney to study engineering in college.\\"Apollo Ground Chief: Glynn Stephen Lunney\\", The New York Times, October 23, 1968. After attending the University of Scranton (1953–1955), he transferred to the University of Detroit, where he enrolled in the cooperative training program run by the Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. The center was a part of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), a United States federal agency founded to promote aeronautical research. Cooperative students at NACA took part in a program that combined work and study, providing a way for them to fund their college degrees while gaining experience in aeronautics. Lunney graduated from college in June 1958, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace engineering. After graduation, Lunney remained with NACA. His first job was as a researcher in aerospace dynamics at Lewis Research Center, where he worked with a team studying the thermodynamics of vehicles during high-speed reentry. Using a B-57 bomber, the team sent small rockets high into the atmosphere in order to measure their heating profile. NASA career Mercury Only a month after Lunney graduated, President Eisenhower signed into existence the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), into which NACA was subsumed. His timing was perfect, for as Lunney later said, \\"there was no such thing as space flight until the month I got out of college\\". Lunney was soon transferred to Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, where in September 1959 he became a member of the Space Task Group, which was the body given responsibility for the creation of NASA's manned space program. Aged twenty-one, he was the youngest of the forty-five members of the group. His first assignment was with the Control Center Simulation Group, which planned the simulations used to train both flight controllers and astronauts for the as-yet unknown experience of manned spaceflight. A member of the Flight Operations Division, Lunney was one of the engineers responsible for planning and creating procedures for Project Mercury, America's first manned space program. He took part in the writing of the first set of mission rules, the guidelines by which both flight controllers and astronauts operated. During Mercury, Lunney became, after Tecwyn Roberts, the second man to serve as the Flight Dynamics Officer (FIDO) in the Mercury Control Center, controlling the trajectory of the spacecraft and planning adjustments to it. His colleague Gene Kranz described him as \\"the pioneer leader of trajectory operations, who turned his craft from an art practiced by a few into a pure science\\". It was during these years that Lunney became the protege of flight director Chris Kraft, a relationship that would last some twenty years. Lunney worked both in the Control Center and at remote sites; during the flight of John Glenn, America's first orbital spaceflight, he was serving as the FIDO in Bermuda. In September 1961, NASA's Space Task Group was reorganized into the Manned Spacecraft Center and moved to Houston, Texas, and Lunney moved with it. In Houston, he became head of the Mission Logic and Computer Hardware section, where he defined and oversaw the computing and display requirements of the flight dynamics division within the new Mission Control Center. Gemini John Hodge and Jones Roach during Gemini 3 Gemini was a step forward for NASA's manned space program: the Gemini capsule was larger and more advanced than Mercury, capable of supporting two men for up to a two-week mission. Because of the longer mission durations, Mission Control began to be manned in shifts. In 1964, Glynn Lunney and Gene Kranz were selected by Chris Kraft to join Kraft and his deputy John Hodge as flight directors. Aged only twenty-eight, Lunney was the youngest of the four. Lunney worked backup on Gemini 3, taking charge of the newly established Mission Control Center in Houston, at a time when flights were still controlled from Cape Canaveral in Florida. On Gemini 4, he again was working backup, this time in Florida, supporting the first mission that was controlled entirely from Houston. After spending some time on unmanned testing for the Apollo program, he returned to work as a flight director on Gemini 9, 10, 11 and 12. Apollo As with Project Mercury, Lunney was involved in Project Apollo right from the beginning. He took charge of the \\"boilerplate\\" tests of the Apollo abort escape system at White Sands, which took place during the Gemini program, and was flight director during the first unmanned Saturn V test flight, SA-501. However, he was not scheduled to serve as a flight director on the first manned Apollo mission, later known as Apollo 1. During the countdown demonstration test that resulted in the Apollo 1 fire, Lunney was at home having dinner with astronaut Bill Anders and his wife, and was called into Mission Control when the fire occurred. It was, as he recalled, \\"a tremendous punch in the stomach to all of us\\". The aftermath of the fire, in which three astronauts were killed, left Lunney and his colleagues at NASA feeling that they had perhaps failed to recognize the risks they were running in their efforts to meet Kennedy's timetable of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. \\"Maybe,\\" said Lunney over thirty years later, \\"we had gotten a little overconfident\\". Lunney on console during the Apollo 16 mission Lunney attracted significant media attention in 1968, when he worked as lead flight director on Apollo 7, the first of the manned Apollo flights. Coming as it did after the Apollo 1 fire, the mission was an important test for the Apollo program, and was stressful for astronauts and controllers alike. Lunney had primary responsibility for dealing with the mission commander, Wally Schirra, who repeatedly questioned orders from the ground. Although pressed by reporters in news conferences, Lunney stayed diplomatic and said nothing critical of Schirra. Privately, however, he was extremely exasperated, and later assured his team of young controllers that \\"manned spaceflight is usually better than this\\". He was also diplomatic about Donn Eisele's sarcastic comment to the CAPCOM that he would \\"like to meet the man, or whomever it was, that dreamed up that little gem.\\" The \\"gem\\" turned out to be Lunney's. As a flight director Lunney was known for his good memory and his unusually quick thought processes—traits that could sometimes prove problematic for his team of flight controllers. \\"Glynn would drive you crazy\\", said Jay Greene, a fellow controller, \\"because his mind would race so fast that he could churn out action items quicker than you could absorb, much less answer.\\" During the Apollo 13 crisis, Lunney played a key role. Coming on shift an hour after the oxygen tank explosion that put the crew's lives in jeopardy, Lunney and his team faced the unprecedented challenge of having to power up the Lunar Module on an extremely tight timeline, while transferring guidance and navigation data to it from the dying command module. His excellent memory and quick thinking were critical in the success of his team during the ensuing hours. Ken Mattingly, the astronaut who had been bumped from the Apollo 13 crew due to his exposure to German measles, later called Lunney's performance \\"the most magnificent display of personal leadership that I've ever seen.\\" On the day following the Apollo 13 splashdown, Lunney joined his fellow flight directors in accepting the Presidential Medal of Freedom as a member of the Apollo 13 mission operations team. The award was made by President Nixon during a ceremony at the Manned Spacecraft Center. Apollo- Soyuz Test Program In 1970, while still a flight director, Lunney was selected as one of the members of a NASA delegation to the Soviet Union, which was to discuss the possibility of cooperation between the two countries in the field of manned spaceflight. \\"For me it was out of the clear blue sky\\", said Lunney, who was told of the plans while at a conference in early October. \\"I did not know anything about [the proposed talks] until that time.\\" The trip took place in late October. While in Moscow, Lunney gave a presentation to Soviet engineers on the techniques that NASA used for orbital rendezvous, and on the compromises that would have to be made in order to achieve a rendezvous between American and Soviet spacecraft. The technical agreement that he helped to draft laid the groundwork for the mission which was to become the Apollo- Soyuz Test Project (ASTP). It was intended to be a joint mission, whose highlight was to be a docking between an American Apollo spacecraft and a Soviet Soyuz. Lunney was named technical director of the ASTP in the following year. As technical director, he made several more trips to the Soviet Union, helping to negotiate the seventeen-point agreement that would govern the conduct of the mission. He also took part in working groups in Houston that dealt with the technical details of the project. A New York Times profile reported that he was taking Russian lessons in order to be better prepared for the role.'\\"Glynn Stephen Lunney\\", The New York Times, May 25, 1972, p. 14. On June 13, 1972, Lunney was given overall responsibility for the test project; henceforth he would be in charge not only of building a partnership with the Soviets, but also of mission planning and of negotiating with North American Rockwell, the spacecraft contractor. According to the official history of the ASTP, Lunney's performance during Apollo 13 and during the Soviet negotiations had recommended him to Chris Kraft, who was by then director of Johnson Space Center. In 1973, Lunney became manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, a position which gave him responsibility for the Apollo spacecraft used during Skylab missions, as well giving him more authority in his role as head of the ASTP. The ASTP mission took place in July 1975. It was criticized by some journalists as a \\"costly space circus,\\" who felt that it wasted NASA funds that could have been better spent on projects such as Skylab. However, Lunney supported the project, saying in a later interview that he did not believe the cooperation necessary to build the International Space Station would have been possible if ASTP had not laid the groundwork for it. Space Shuttle After the ASTP mission was completed, Lunney became manager of the Shuttle Payload Integration and Development Program. During this period, it was anticipated that NASA's space shuttle fleet would be flying very frequent missions, and carrying commercial payloads as well as flying missions for government organizations such as the Department of Defense and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The payload integration program was responsible for determining how the various demands of these customers could be satisfied, and how mixed payloads could best be physically accommodated within the cargo bay of the shuttle. During these years Lunney also spent time working at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., as Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Flight and later as Acting Associate Administrator for Space Transportation Operations. Glynn Lunney (far right) as manager of the Shuttle program, at a press conference with Chris Kraft and Gene Kranz in 1981 In 1981, Lunney became manager of the Space Shuttle program, a high-level position where Lunney found himself responsible for setting the agenda for the developing program. His responsibilities were broad ones; they included supervising program planning, budgeting and scheduling; systems engineering; and mission planning. During the earlier shuttle flights he was involved in determining whether the weather was suitable for launch, but in later years that responsibility was largely devolved to lower levels of the hierarchy. Many of his colleagues had expected Lunney to succeed his mentor, Chris Kraft, as director of Johnson Space Center; Neil Hutchinson, a fellow flight director, later commented that Lunney \\"was sort of the anointed one\\". However, when Kraft retired in 1982, former Apollo flight director Gerry Griffin was offered the position instead. In 1985, Lunney decided to leave NASA, feeling that the Space Shuttle program had worn him out physically and mentally and that he was ready for a new type of challenge. Although he had retired from NASA the year before, he was called to testify before the U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology in the aftermath of the Challenger accident. While still manager of the shuttle program, he had signed the \\"Criticality 1\\" waiver that allowed Challenger to launch even though the joints of its solid rocket boosters had recently been redefined as non-redundant systems.\\"Space Transportation System\\". His actions were not unusual in the context of NASA practice at the time, which allowed a \\"walk through\\" of such potentially controversial waivers if no debate was expected. Career at Rockwell Upon leaving NASA in 1985, Lunney took a position at Rockwell International, the contractor responsible for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the Space Shuttle. At first he worked in California, managing a Rockwell division that was building satellites for the Global Positioning System; this was his first experience with unmanned spacecraft. In 1990, he returned to Houston as President of the Rockwell Space Operations Company, which provided support for flight operations at Johnson Space Center and employed about 3000 people. For Lunney, this represented a return to his roots in mission operations, which he had left twenty years before. In 1995, Rockwell joined forces with its competitor Lockheed Martin to form the United Space Alliance, a jointly owned organization created to provide operations support for NASA, as well as to take over some of the functions previously performed by NASA employees. At this point, Lunney became Vice President and Program Manager of the United Space Alliance's spaceflight operations in Houston; he stayed in this position until his retirement in 1999. Personal life Lunney in December 2008 While at Lewis Research Center, Lunney met Marilyn Kurtz, who worked there as a nurse. They have been married since 1960 and have four children: Jennifer; Glynn, Jr., now a Professor of Law at Texas A&M; University;https://law.tamu.edu/faculty-staff/find-people/faculty- profiles/glynn-s-lunney-jr Shawn, and Bryan. Their youngest son Bryan has also pursued a career at NASA, becoming a flight director in 2001 and working missions including STS-115, STS-120, STS-123, STS-131 and STS-133. During his leisure hours, Lunney enjoys sailing; during the sixties the family owned a twenty-foot sailboat which they took out on Galveston Bay, and he occasionally dreamed of going with his wife and children on an ocean cruise lasting for months. In his retirement he has taken up golf, saying that \\"I have come to realize that golf will never be mastered, but will continue to be humbling.\\" Awards and honors Lunney is a Fellow of the American Astronomical Society and of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. In 1971, he was awarded an honorary Doctorate from the University of Scranton. He has received many awards from NASA, including three Group Achievement Awards, two Exceptional Service Medals and three Distinguished Service Medals. In 2005, he received the National Space Trophy from the Rotary National Award for Space Achievement Foundation. The award is given to individuals who have made an outstanding and career-spanning contribution to America's space program. Previous winners have included Chris Kraft and Neil Armstrong.National Space Trophy Winners.

As a manager, he inspired his employees to do their best work and offered direction and encouragement to his team when challenges arose; as an explorer, he always looked toward the future and saw the endless possibilities and benefits of man's journey into space.\\" In 2008 he received the Elmer A. Sperry Award, jointly with Thomas P. Stafford, Aleksei A. Leonov and Konstantin D. Bushuyev, for their work on the Apollo-Soyuz mission and the Apollo-Soyuz docking interface design. In films In the 1995 film Apollo 13, Glynn Lunney was portrayed by Marc McClure. However, McClure had a relatively minor role. Writer Charles Murray lamented the fact that Lunney was \\"barely visible in the movie\\", being overshadowed by the focus on Lunney's fellow flight director Gene Kranz. \\"Without slighting Kranz's role\\", Murray commented, \\"the world should remember that it was Glynn Lunney ... who orchestrated a masterpiece of improvisation that moved the astronauts safely to the lunar module while sidestepping a dozen potential catastrophes that could have doomed them.\\" Lunney has been interviewed in numerous documentaries about the space program, including Apollo 13: To the Edge and Back (PBS), To the Moon (PBS), Failure is Not an Option (History Channel) and ABC News 20/20's Moment of Crisis: Apollo 13.

He was a bishop and later saint. Little that can be regarded as reliable is known about Ailbe: in Irish sources from the 8th century he is regarded as the first bishop, and later patron saint of Emly in Munster. Later Welsh sources (from the 11th c.) associate him with Saint David whom he was credited with baptizing and very late sources (16th c.) even give him a local Welsh genealogy making him an Ancient Briton. Saint Ailbe is venerated as one of the four great patrons of Ireland. His feast day is 12 September. He is the patron saint of the Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly.\\"History\\", Emly Parish. Sources The life of Ailbe is included in the Vitae Sanctorum Hiberniae (VSH), a Latin collection of medieval Irish saints' lives compiled in the 14th century. There are three major manuscript versions of the VSH: the Dublin, Oxford, and Salamanca. Charles Plummer compiled an edition of the VSH based on the two surviving Dublin manuscripts in 1910. Professor William W. Heist of the University of Michigan compiled an edition of the single Salamanca manuscript in 1965; trans. in De Paor, Liam (1993) \\"Saint Patrick’s World\\", Dublin: Four Courts Press Oxford professor Richard Sharpe suggests that the Salamanca manuscript is the closest to the original text from which all three versions derive. Sharpe's analysis of the Irish name-forms in the Codex Salamanticensis showed similarities between it and the Life of Saint Brigid, a verifiably 7th-century text, leading him to posit that nine (and possibly ten) of the lives were written much earlier, -850. He further proposed that this earlier Life of Ailbe in the Codex Salmanticensis was originally composed to further the cause of the Éoganacht Church of Emly. The Law of Ailbe (784) was issued, possibly in response to the Law of Patrick.p.19 in Ó Riain-Raedel, Dagmar (1998). \\"The Question of the 'Pre-Patrician' Saints of Munster\\" in \\"Early Medieval Munster. Archaeology, History and Society\\", ed. M.A. Monk and J. Sheehan. Cork. 17–22. The later lives of the Dublin collection go further and make Ailbe the principal 'pre-Patrican' Saint of Ireland (the others are Ciarán of Saighir, Declan of Ardmore, Abbán of Moyarney and Ibar of Beggerin or Beggery Island)Sharpe op.cit., pp. 115-6. The Dublin Life of Ailbe asserts that Munster was entrusted to him by St Patrick, while to similar effect, Ailbe is called a \\"second Patrick and patron of Munster\\" (secundus Patricius et patronus Mumenie) in the Life of Saint Declán of Ardmore.Ó Riain-Raedel, op.cit. p. 19. Further material is provided by the lives of related saints such as Patrick. All include numerous miraculous events and obvious inconsistencies and anachronisms.Baring-Gould, Sabine & al. The Lives of the British Saints: The Saints of Wales and Cornwall and Such Irish Saints as Have Dedications in Britain, Vol. I, pp. 128 ff. Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion (London), 1911. In fact the earliest mention of the name Ailbeus would seem to be in Tirechan's late 7th century Life of Saint Patrickch. 6.4 and ch. 18 in Bieler, Ludwig (1979) \\"Patrician Texts from the Book of Armagh\\", Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies. although this seems to be in reference to a different 'Ailbe', a priest associated with the Ui Aillello, in Connaught, latterly known as 'Saint Ailbe of Sencua (Shancoe in County Sligo)'.

Legendary life In a legend that goes back to the Vita, or 'Saint's Life', Ailbhe's father fled King Cronan before the child's birth and his mother's servants—ordered by the king to put the baby to death—instead placed him on a rock in the wilderness where he was found and nursed by a she-wolfBallingarry. \\"Slieveardagh Parish History\\". Long afterwards, when Ailbe was bishop, an old she-wolf being pursued by a hunting party ran to the bishop and laid her head upon his breast. Ailbhe protected the wolf and thereafter fed her and her cubs every day from his hall. Ailbe was discovered in the forest by visiting Britons: these British foster-parents were said to have planned to leave him in Ireland when they returned home but were constantly and miraculously unable to make the passage until they consented to take him with them. They then took Ailbe with them when they returned to Wales (Vita Albei 2). A tradition also going back to the earliest Vita (Vita Albei 9) held that he went to Rome and was ordained as a bishop by Saint Hilary who was then pope. Upon being ordained in Rome, he was said to have fed the people of the city for three days before returning home. At the end of his life, a supernatural ship came and he boarded to learn the secret of his death. Returning from the faerie world, he went back to Emly to die and be buried.Answers.com. \\"Ailbhe\\". The earliest Vita states that Saint Ailbe was baptised by Palladius (Vita Albei 2), something that might be compatible with the tradition that made him a 'pre- Patrician' evangelizer of Ireland (since Palladius was recorded as having been sent to Ireland in 431, most likely before Patrick's time). The year of his death – 528 - that is recorded in the 'Annals of Innisfallen' (compiled at Emly probably in 1092),Seán Mac Airt, ed. & trans, \\"The Annals of Inisfallen\\", Dublin 1944 ('The Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies' 1951, reprinted 1988) is not, however, compatible with a 'pre-Patrician' career. It may well be, though, a reflection of the fact that many such obits (records of the date of death) of Irish saints were retrospectively added to the annals. Ailbhe was said to have founded the monastery and diocese of Emly (), which became very important in Munster. He was said to have been responsible for King Aengus's donation of island lands for Saint Enda's monastery.Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly He is also associated with the 6th-century foundation of Clane Friary, in modern County Kildare.

Ailbe in \\"Dictionary of Irish Biography\\", Royal Irish Academy, Cambridge University Press The name Ailbe figures quite extensively in a context of Irish folk tale, with its likely origins mainly in pre-Christian pagan mythology.

An Ailbe was also daughter of Mider, son of the Dagda.Dooley, op.cit. p.15 The name \\"Ailbe\\" The name Ailbe was explained in the Vita Albei as derivative of ail 'a rock' and beo, 'living'. In the words of Baring Gould and FisherBaring-Gould and Fisher (1907), \\"The Lives of the British Saints\\" Vol I, p. 130 this is \\"a very doubtful etymology\\". It is clearly related to the story of his being exposed behind a rock after his birth, before being cared for by a wolf (Vita Albei 2)Heist op.cit. 167-81; trans. De Paor op.cit pp. 227-43 and looks very much like a folk-etymology. Nevertheless, we can note a sporadic association of Ailbe (as saint or mythological figure) with ' rocks' (Irish ail). The Lia Ailbe (stone of Ailbe) on the Magh Ailbe (plain of Ailbe) may be in origin tautological, while a Sliabh Ailbe was associated with a legendary figure Ailbe in Duanaire Finn.II, 95, xlii in MacNeill, Eoin and Murphy, Gerard (1908-54) Duanaire Finn, 3 vols, Irish Texts Society 7, 28, 43.

This appears in Irish as Albe-, Alpe- and Albu, Alpu. There is, however, no obvious explanation for this name to appear in the form ailbe and the root albi(i̭)o- would not take that form in Irish, according to the way that language normally developed. The i, in the ai of Ailbe, is not a full vowel but represents an audible 'glide' before a palatised l.pp. 55-7, §86 in Thurneysen, Rudolf (1946) \\"A Grammar of Old Irish\\", Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies This palatised l, with i-glide is not found in Irish Albu, 'Britain'. All of this renders the precise form of the name Ailbe, in Irish, arguably, somewhat mysterious. Interpretation as a localised version of the cult of Saint Alban Philip ThornhillThornhill, Philip (2000) \\"The Sub-Roman Cult of Saint Alban\\" (\\"St. Alban and the End of Roman Britain Part 1\\") in 'The Mankind Quarterly' 41, pp. 3-42. (Revised Version ) has argued that the Irish cult of Ailbe represents in origin a localised version of the cult of the British martyr Saint Alban. The latter is explained as being rooted itself in pre- Christian religion or mythology but also as bearing some relation to Albion as the ancient name for Britain and designed to serve as a symbol for the corporate identity of the Britons in the new Christian era. It will have been, according to this argument, to some extent a 're-invention' designed to serve a political purpose in unifying the Britons, probably under the dominance of Verulamium (the modern Saint Albans) where the cult of the martyr Alban was most probably based. Critical to the theory is the interpretation of the Elafius mentioned in the Vita Germani, or Life of Saint Germanus, as a mis- hearing, in a garbled version of the story of Saint Germanus's visit to Britain, of the name Albios or Albius, as an alternative name for Albanus – the latter possibly representing a later version of the name, perhaps introduced by Germanus. A Celtic Albios or vulgar Latin Albius, pronounced in a British-Celtic way, would have given – so Thornhill argues – a name Ailbe, if borrowed into Irish. The ei in the Welsh form (Llan)eilfyw would be explained by the process of i-assimilation, a feature of the development of the Brittonic Celtic languages and a process which would have been underway by the 5th century.pp. in 260, 238-9, 247-8 Sims-Williams, Patrick (1990) \\"Dating the Transition to Neo-Brittonic: Phonology and History, 400 to 600\\" in A Bammesberger, A. Wollman, ed., \\"Britain 400 to 600: Language and History\\", Heidelberg: Winter; cf. pp. 558, 560-1 (lenition b to ƀ) & 579-618 (final i-affection) in Jackson, Kenneth. H (1953) \\"Language and History in Early Britain\\", Edinburgh. The change from a to ei by the effect of the following i (i-assimilation) would be typical of the North West (latterly Welsh) dialects of the ancient British language – and it is likely the cult would have spread from nearby Wales to Ireland. The l with i-glide seen in Irish ailbe would have been the nearest Irish equivalent to the ei- in a Brittonic name Eilbhios < Albios/us undergoing i-assimilation. Thornhill quotes Prosper of AquitaineProsper of Aquitaine, Prosperi Tironis Epitoma Chronicon, in Monumenta Germaniae Historica (MGH), Chronica Minora vol 1, 1892, Mommsen, Theodore, ed., Berlin: Weidemann pp. 385-485; Migne, Patrologia Latina vol.51 ; English trans. in \\"From Roman to Merovingian Gaul: A Reader\\" ed. & trans. A. C Murray (Ontario, 2003) pp. 62–76 who reports the sending of Palladius (said in the Vita Albei to have baptised Ailbe) in 431, a few years after Germanus visited the cult centre of Saint Alban in Britain in 429. For the 'British connections' of the cult of saint Ailbe see above. It might be possible that the name was introduced by an actual (missionary) Briton named Albios/us but that would leave the occurrence of the name in early Irish literature and folk tale hard to explain. Thornhill argues that these medieval sources represent not only ancient pagan mythology but also syncretic influences that might have been at work from the 5th century onwards. The name Ailbe would have entered into the folk tradition through the displacement of an original pagan cult at Emly which it may have become identified with and through the typical pagan- mythological, probably solar, associations of the root albho- which may have had their equivalent in Irish tradition. Thornhill points in particular to a likely assimilation to the pagan (probably solar) deity Aillil or Aillen, connected with the Ui Aillelo associated with the second saint 'Ailbe of Sencua', the warrior Aillil on whose chariot the head of the 'divine hound' Ailbhe ends up being impaled and the female eponym of Aillen, near the Mag Ailbhe, whose marvellous lap-dog was called Ailbhe. Thornhill suggests that a parallel assimilation occurred in Britain to the Al- of Alauna (a Celtic toponym and theonym) and related names, and that a typical outcome of this assimilation was the element El- found in several Brittonic saints' names. He also compares the Navigatio's 'island of Ailbe' to the 'island of Britain' or Albion as (so he argues) associated with Albios/Albanus.'Al = Rock[y]; Ban/Ben', 'means Mountain' Legacy St Ailbe's Cross in Emly. In Emly, there is a Catholic church dedicated to St Ailbe which dates to the late nineteenth century. An ancient and weathered Celtic cross in its churchyard is known as \\"St Ailbe's Cross\\". The early nineteenth-century church of St Ailbe is now used as the village hall. A ninth-century monastic rule, written in Old Irish, bears his name.Duffy, Patrick. \\"St. Ailbe of Emly\\", CaholicIreland.net Although St Elvis in Wales is now in ruins,The Modern Antiquarian. \\"St Elvis\\". there is still a shrine to the parish's namesake at , which bears an inscription concerning his name and connection to St David.

Created, written and produced by Sam Peckinpah, who also directed some episodes, the series was a Four Star Television production. The Westerner stars Brian Keith as amiable, unexceptional cowhand/drifter Dave Blassingame, and features John Dehner as rakish Burgundy Smith, who appeared in three episodes. Overview Dave Blassingame was a basically decent, ordinary man who was handy with a gun and his fists. A cowboy and drifter, he could sometimes behave amorally in his quest to get enough money together to buy his own ranch, but always did the right thing in the end, and remained true to himself. His equally amiable dog Brown was played by Spike, who was trained by Frank Weatherwax and is best known for playing the title role in Old Yeller. Brown figured prominently in a number of episodes, appeared in all of them, and was always seen faithfully following Blassingame in the end credits.

Production and score The musical score was largely the work of Four Star's Herschel Burke Gilbert. Episodes Broadcast The pilot for The Westerner appeared on CBS's Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater. Syndication as The Westerners For rerun syndication it was grouped with three other short-lived Western series from the same company, Black Saddle starring Peter Breck, Johnny Ringo starring Don Durant, and Law of the Plainsman starring Michael Ansara, under the umbrella title The Westerners, bracketed with hosting sequences featuring Keenan Wynn. Home media A two- DVD set of the complete series was released by Shout! Factory in February 2017. Reception The critically acclaimed series ran for 13 episodes, but it was cancelled because of low ratings (due to being placed in the same time slot as The Flintstones and Route 66). Spin-offs and remakes The Losers (1963) An unsuccessful attempt to update and revive the hardbitten series aired as a January 1963 episode of The Dick Powell Theater, \\"The Losers\\", directed by Peckinpah and featuring Lee Marvin as Dave Blassingame and Keenan Wynn as Burgundy Smith, but set in the modern West.

Dona Massin appeared in over 100 films throughout her career. Early years Dona Massin's family moved to Los Angeles, California when she was eight years old. She started her show business career as a child. Also at the age of eight, she sang My Man at the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles and received a standing ovation. She then was discovered by Maurice Kosell and was given free dancing lessons due to her natural talent. At the age of 14, Dona was signed to MGM Studios and worked on many of the musicals. She also worked at 20th Century Fox, Universal, Warner Bros. and Columbia Pictures. The Wizard of Oz In 1939, at the age of 21, Massin was signed to production of The Wizard of Oz, where she worked as a choreographer assisting Bobby Connolly. The film took 6 months to complete. Dona was the first to sing \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\", and it was she who pushed for the song to be in the film. She also originated the skip that was performed down the yellow brick road. The skip is a ballet step called pas de basque however, Massin had it executed at a quicker speed than was usual for the step. In the film itself, Massin can be seen grooming the Lion in the scene at the beauty shop. Mervyn Leroy put her in that part to bring good luck to the film.

He also works as an illustrator, sculptor and writing coach. His real name is Thijs van Ebbenhorst Tengbergen. The length of his name proved cumbersome, as he tells in an interview with Mad Scientist Journal, leaving little room for a title and a picture on the cover of his novels so he shortened it to Tais Teng. Other pen names he used are Eban Hourst and Ben Bergen. This was mostly in search of a pen name which was pronounceable in other languages than Dutch. To date Tais Teng has written more than a hundred novels both for adults and children in the Dutch language and he has won the Paul Harland Prize four times. His books have been translated in German, Finnish, French and English. Tais Teng is a bilingual writer and writes in both Dutch and English. He likes to work together with other writers and has co authored short stories and novels with Paul Harland, Eddy C. Bertin, Bies van Ede, Roderick Leeuwenhart, Roelof Goudriaan and Jaap Boekestein. Griezelgenootschap In the Netherlands Tais Teng is best known as a member of the Griezelgenootschap, a group of Dutch horror writers who published a yearbook of horror stories and gave performances and signing sessions for interested fans from 1994 to 2003. Paul van Loon was the chairman. The horror wave was just at her top then, so these were massive happenings, with thousands of participants. The series Gooseflesh of R.L. Stine had the same effect in the English speaking countries. Tais Teng wrote the three-novel-series Duisterlingen (Darklings) with Eddy C. Bertin and Bies van Ede about three children with special powers who can travel into the nightmarish dreamland Yldorgei. As a member Tais Teng produced two dozen more horror novels, ranging from Middle Grade to Young Adult. His most popular series was the Griezelklas (Monsterclass) for very special children. Their long suffering teacher has to keep order in a class with vampire sisters, a man-eating kelpie, a witch, a hot-tempered dwarf with a sledgehammer and half a dozen even more dangerous pupils. Literary influenceshttps://mythaxis.com/2020/03/01/channeling-jack-vance- shared-worlds-and-writing-in-another-man/ Homegrown Dutch science fiction When Tais Teng started reading in earnest fantasy was almost nonexistent in the Netherlands, but science fiction flourished, most of it homegrown. So he grew up with the idea that the Dutch engineering know-how would put them on the Moon and Mars first. Monus, de Man van de Maan (Monus, the Man from the Moon) by A.D. Hildebrandt was an extremely popular audioplay which was aired every week. Wim van der Gaag wrote with De Kristallen Tiran (The Crystal Tiran) a kind of cyberpunk avant la lettre: very short and with very information-dense sentences. This tale about a war between an Earth computer system and the vegetable brain of Mars made Tais Teng decide that he wanted to be a writer. Partly it was the style: it was revelation that one could tell so many original things on a single page. It was a style he still like to use for any Hard science fiction story. English SF and fantasy The moment Tais Teng started writing Jack Vance was the most important writer for the fledgling Dutch sf-writers, more so than Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov. They wanted to write like him, but is soon became apparent that imitating his style wasn't enough: you still had to tell a good tale. Several of Tais Teng's first tales were Jack Vance imitations. In 2019 wrote the novel Phaedra: Alastor 824, an authorised sequel to the Alastor Cluster novels of the grandmaster himself.https://mythaxis.com/2020/03/01/channeling-jack-vance-shared-worlds- and-writing-in-another-man/ It was published by Spatterlight Press}} as part of the Paladins of Vance imprint. Several older fantasy writers inspired him, most notably Lord Dunsany with The Gods of Pegana These very short stories form an early example of Flash stories. Tais Teng's collection Glazen Speren can be seen as the kind of homage to Lord Dunsany. The same is the case of several stories set in The Night Land of William Hope Hodgson and the Zothique tales inspired by Clark Ashton Smith. With Paul Harland he co-wrote Computer Code Cthulhu a Cthulhu Mythos novel set in the near future. The horror writer H. P. Lovecraft remains a strong influence in his horror stories and Tais Teng named his first English collection Lovecraft, My Love. The Dutch Ziltpunk movement Tais Teng is one of the founders of Ziltpunk, a literary movement that seeks to counter the apathetic dismay of so many Dystopian novels. The Ziltpunk stories are climate fiction which looks for solutions: the Dutch equivalent of solarpunk. The raising of the sea level is a rather urgent problem for the Dutch, with half of their land lying below sea level. Al Gore didn't see much of future for the Dutch in An Inconvenient Truth. Ziltpunk describes the massive geoengineering projects which writers consider the only way to counter the hothouse changes. Think of sixty meter high dikes, mangrove islands planted in the sea to counter floodwaves or even raising the land itself by injecting the underlying chalk layers with hydrogen sulfide. The stories seldom describe a rosy utopia: survival with some joie de vivre is enough. The focus of ziltpunk stories is mainly on the Netherlands, with a can-do mentality reminiscent of the Golden Age Science Fiction. Part of the ziltpunk future is already here: the Dutch are building ever higher dunes along the sea coast and movable dikes like the Maeslantkering to control the both the sea and rivers. To date the ziltpunk movement has published three novels and some two dozen stories. Roderick Leeuwenhart and Johan Klein Haneveld recently joined the founders and wrote their own stories and novels. Several ziltpunk stories have been published in English: Any house in the Storm, Tidal treasures or Growing up along the Mile-high Dyke and Buitendyks, where the Night-gulls yodel.

He got his start making B & W interior illustrations for Atlan, a spin-off of the German sf series Perry Rhodan. This was Space Opera: he had to draw a lot of exploding starships, robots and aliens. At the same time he got a commision to paint the sf covers for CentriPress most notably the Jerry Cornelius novels by Michael Moorcock. He used oils and acrylic paint and while oil paint looked better, it also took a fortnight to dry, which can be a problem when a publisher is waiting for the cover. He soon switched to Airbrushing. The technique was perfect to paint the surrealistic Salvador Dali inspired twilight skies so often used in science fiction, but the painting was easily spoiled when the flow of paint started spattering. For each part of the picture one also had to cut out plastic stencils to preserve earlier parts. When Photoshop came around, he embraced digital painting. Here any mistake can be corrected and there is no drying time. Nowadays Tais Teng makes use of computer generated Fractals and kaleidoscopic madalas to construct his landscapes.https://amazingstories.com/2014/04/asnis- art-blog-interview-tais-teng/ An avid photographer he has a extensive databank of figures and objects. For his Black & white illustrations he often uses Scraperboard or digital etchings. He also painted murals and background decors for plays, for which he followed a training as decor painter at art academy Artibus in Utrecht.

Being a horror writer he prefers making gargoyles. For smaller pieces he also uses springstone, a quite hard material often used in African art. The marl statues come in block of 20-20-60 centimeter. They are stacked with the lower piece forming a decorated plinth. He often uses these statues as part of a cover image, integrating them with the rest of the picturehttps://www.deviantart.com/taisteng/art/View-from-Yuggoth-213600393. Trivia Tais Teng likes to use very long titles which tell their own mini- tale for his short stories. Two of the most extreme samples: \\"Why we are standing on a broken wall, clutching swords too rusty to take an edge\\" and \\"A perfect day with the dead men shrieking and the sky filled with northern light.https://mythaxis.com/2020/03/01/the-joy-of-very-long-titles-and-why- publishers-hate-them/\\" . When asked what his most heartfelt wish was, he answered as a sculptor: \\"A Star Wars laser cannon to carve mountains or one of Jupiter's moons.\\" Further reading and sources * Van Duin, John, Ziltpunk: zeker geen zure bedoening, HSF (2019/1) * de Valk, Arnold, Abstracte kunst heeft meestal geen verhaal, Amersfoorts Dagblad, 28 June 2017 * Bruinsma Robin, Als de dood voor kleine foutjes, Algemeen Dagblad, 9 May 2007 * Verschuren, Herman, Lezen over Tais Teng, * Nielsch, Astrid (interview with tais Teng about his art * Barkel, Theo, De ideeënmachine Tais Teng * Lindeboom, Martijn, De 5 w’s van Tais Teng * Lodder, Arie, The Dutch are coming 2: Tais Teng * Lodder, Arie, review Lovecraft, my love * Interview about Tais Teng's love of long titles in Mad Scientist journal * Q-magazine-edition 5, Schrijver van eigen bodem * Kaptein, Peter, Fantastische kunstenaars: Tais Teng * In de ban van de fantasy, Meer met media, September 2008 * Adelmund, Martijn, De wilde werkelijkheid van Gran Terre, Warp, 2009, ISSN: 1385-1616 External links *Author's website (Dutch) *Author's website (English) *Author's art website (English) * 1952 births Living people Dutch fantasy writers Dutch science fiction writers Writers from The Hague Dutch male novelists Graphic artists Cover artists People from Amersfoort ","title":"Tais Teng"},{"id":"6393317","text":"Sant Carles de la Ràpita is a town in the area of the Montsià in Catalonia, Spain. The town covers a portion of the south-west of the Ebro Delta, including el Trabucador isthmus and la Banya peninsula, which close off a salt water lagoon known as the Port dels Alfacs. The town of Sant Carles de la Ràpita is situated on the coast near the mouth of the lagoon. It was founded by Charles III of Spain as a port to serve trade with the Spanish colonies, and constructed in the neoclassical style of the period. However, much of the town remained uncompleted after Charles' death. Sant Carles is part of the Taula del Sénia free association of municipalities. It is known for the production of rice and salt, and is also an important fishing port, particularly for shellfish and prawns, and a tourist centre. In the early years of the present century, the town experienced a huge urban development due to the construction of many apartments and residential buildings.  Demography  The town now hosts two large marinas, a beach, a market and many shops and restaurants. It is attractive and draws an increasing number of tourists each summer.

His active career extended from 1905 to 1935, during which he created many colorful works in oil on canvas and board. One of his works, a reproduction of which is at the Smithsonian Institution, was awarded the Salmagundi Club's Samuel T. Shaw Prize in 1922.Edmund W. Greacen papers, 1905-1949 In addition to his work as an artist, Greacen also founded, ran and taught in New York City's Grand Central School of Art for more than 20 years.Staff report (November 23, 1924). 400 ENROLL IN 6 WEEKS.; Grand Central School of Art Announces List of Instructors. The New York Times Origins Greacen was born in New York City, New York, the son of Thomas Edmund Greacen and Isabella Wiggins. Greacen's father had arrived from Scotland in 1868 and had established a shoe business.Biography Edmund Greacen Thanks to the father's success in business affairs, the family was able to maintain a home at 6 West 50th Street—the site is now occupied by the Rockefeller Center — and in Delaware County in upstate New York, where the couple and their four children spent their summers. Greacen earned a bachelor's degree from New York University and afterward was sent on a \\"shoe-selling world cruise\\" by his father, who wanted him distracted from a fascination with the Spanish–American War.http://www.mcdougallfinearts.com/artists/Edmund-Greacen/biography.aspx After returning, Greacen decided to pursue the career of an artist and in 1899 enrolled at the Art Students League of New York, also taking classes at the New York School of Art, where he studied with William Merritt Chase. During his studies Greacen met Ethol Booth of New Haven, Connecticut, an art student enrolled in the nearby Miss Morgan's art school. They were married in 1904. In 1905 Greacen and his wife traveled to Spain with the Chase class, and then the couple went on to study in the Netherlands, Belgium, and England. Ethol was the primary model for her husband's en plein air paintings made during this time. A son, Edmund William Jr, was born in Paris in 1906, and by the summer of 1907 the family had rented a house in Giverny, France, near the home of Claude Monet. Greacen only met the painter once, but was impressed with the artist as well as the paintings of water lilies he was creating. While at Giverny the couple's daughter, Nan, was born in 1908. New York The family returned to the United States in 1910 and Greacen established studio in New York City that he would maintain until 1917. He began exhibiting his work at shows and galleries, joined the National Arts Club, and started the Manhattan School of Art. While continuing to work in Manhattan, he also became a member of the Old Lyme Art Colony of American Impressionists at Old Lyme, Connecticut. It was there that his free-brush style depicting landscapes and flower gardens continued to evolve. During World War I Greacen served for six months, but did so with the French YMCA because of his age. After returning to New York, Greacen continued his art career. In 1920 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1935. In 1922 a one-man show at the Macbeth Gallery was followed by his receiving the Samuel T. Shaw Prize, worth $1,000, from the Salmagundi Club. The same year, Greacen joined with John Singer Sargent and Walter Leighton Clark to establish the Painters and Sculptors Gallery Association, an artists' cooperative. Out of this association grew the Grand Central Art Galleries and the Grand Central School of Art, of which Greacen became the director. Greacen led the Grand Central School of Art for 20 years. Because his work kept him more and more in New York City, he ended his association with the Old Lyme artists' colony. He was elected an associate member of the National Academy of Design during this time, and in 1935 he was elevated to the status of Academician. Shortly after, however, a series of strokes impaired his health, and he and his wife moved to Florida. They eventually chose to return to New York after several years, and Greacen died at White Plains, New York at age 73. Archives The papers of Edmund Greacen are at the Smithsonian Institution's Archives of American Art. Included are numerous writings, drawings, and photographs, as well as materials related to the National Academy of Design, the National Arts Club, the Manhattan School of Art, and the Grand Central School of Art.

Basketball was invented by James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1891. Volleyball was invented by William G. Morgan in Holyoke, Massachusetts, in 1895. Also, the first organized ice hockey game in the United States is widely believed to have been played in Concord, New Hampshire in 1883. The region is famous for its passion for baseball and the Boston Red Sox, as well as for the intense rivalry between the Red Sox and the New York Yankees. On November 1, 1924, the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League became the first NHL franchise to be based in the United States, and the second-oldest surviving major professional sports team in Boston, after the Red Sox. The Bruins' historic rivalry with the Montreal Canadiens for ice hockey fans in the Boston area has, at times, reached the level of intensity of the Yankees – Red Sox rivalry in professional baseball in the region. The New England Patriots football team is based in Foxborough, Massachusetts, halfway between Boston and Providence. In 1999, the Patriots flirted with the idea of moving to Hartford, in what three National Football League (NFL) franchise owners called \\"the greatest financial deal any NFL owner has ever received\\". The deal, however, fell through, and the team remained in Foxborough. Both the oldest Major League Baseball (MLB) professional baseball park still in use, Fenway Park, dating from April 1912, as well as the oldest indoor ice hockey rink still in use worldwide, Matthews Arena, which first opened in 1910 and currently stands on the property of Northeastern University for their collegiate ice hockey teams, are within the Boston city limits. Hartford Whalers Until April 13, 1997, Hartford also had its own major hockey team, the Hartford Whalers. Originally known as the New England Whalers, they changed their name in 1979 after leaving the WHA for the NHL, hoping to carve a niche market in Hartford. In 1997, the Whalers left Hartford for Raleigh, North Carolina (amid much controversy), where they became the Hurricanes. Fan base In the parts of southwestern Connecticut that are close to New York City, most people are New York Yankees and New York Mets fans, who are often self-identified as suburban New Yorkers. The New York Giants and New York Jets also receive significant support from New England, primarily from the southwestern portions of Connecticut. Additionally, until the team relocated to Washington, D.C. for the start of the 2005 season, the Montreal Expos received some fan support in northern New England. The Quebec Nordiques and Montreal Canadiens were the NHL closest teams in Northern New England. For the Mets, when they were in the World Series in their championship season of , split allegiances among fans of both the Mets and opposing Boston Red Sox led to an article in The Boston Globe to coin the phrase \\"Red Sox Nation\\". Since the mid nineteen nineties, the University of Connecticut basketball program (winning four men's and 7 women's national titles since 1995) has drawn a large regional following especially in their home state of Connecticut. The Boston College Eagles hockey team has also attracted a large following, winning four national championships in 2001, 2008, 2010, and 2012. Their football team also garnered support while current Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan played for the Eagles. The Boston University Terriers hockey team has likewise received large support over the years, winning the national championship in 2009, and has been a staple of Boston collegiate hockey over the past century. The Green Line Rivalry between Boston University and Boston College has been said to be one of the greatest rivalries in all of sports; the two teams compete against each other as well as the hockey teams from fellow Boston universities Harvard University Crimson and Northeastern University Huskies. New England is home to an NFL Football team, the New England Patriots. The Patriots, based in Foxborough, Massachusetts, are the most popular NFL team in Massachusetts.https://247sports.com/nfl/dallas-cowboys/ContentGallery/The-NFL- Fan-Brand-Report-for-2018-119381933/ However, the other 5 states all have fan base with another NFL team, but the Patriots remain supreme overall . The Pittsburgh Steelers have a fanbase in eastern New England (Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine), and the New York Giants are dominant in the western states (Connecticut, with a sizable number in Vermont).https://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2016/12/19/the-most-popular- nfl-teams-in-states-that-dont-have-one/#3498a5984f7c New Hampshire Motor Speedway is an oval racetrack which has hosted several NASCAR and American Championship Car Racing races, whereas Lime Rock Park is a traditional road racing venue home of sports car races. Both NASCAR Cup races at New Hampshire Motor Speedway draw over 100,000 fans, thus making NHMS the largest capacity sports venue in New England. New Hampshire also possesses the New England Dragway facility in Epping, New Hampshire as one of the very few remaining dragstrips in the New England region.

It bears the date of AD 548 based on a presumed connection to Oran; however, the placename is more likely derived from fuarán, \\"spring\\", with no connection to Oran. An Aer Lingus Boeing 757 named St Otteran-Odhrán. Oran or Odran (Gaelic Oran/Odran/Odhrán, the dh being silent; Latin Otteranus, hence sometimes Otteran; died AD 548), by tradition a descendant of Conall Gulban, was a companion of Saint Columba in Iona, and the first Christian to be buried on that island. St. Odhrán's feast day is on 27 October. Life Odran lived for over forty years in the area now known as Silvermines, in County Tipperary, Ireland, building a church there in 520.\\"Silvermines\\". Killaloe Diocese. Retrieved 25 May 2015. According to Irish tradition, Odran also served as abbot of Meath, and founded Lattreagh. In 563, he was among the twelve who accompanied St Columba to the Scottish island of Iona, where he died and was buried. Columba is said to have seen devils and angels fight over Odran's soul before it ascended into heaven.\\"UCB News\\". United Church of Bute. October 2006. One popular legend surrounding Odran's death is that he consented to being buried alive beneath a chapel that Columba was attempting to build at Iona. A voice had told Columba that the walls of the chapel would not stand until a living man was buried below the foundations, and indeed, each morning the builders would arrive at the site to find all their work of the previous day undone. So Odran was consigned to the earth, and the chapel was erected above him. One day, however, Odran lifted his head out of the ground and said: \\"There is no Hell as you suppose, nor Heaven that people talk about\\". Alarmed by this, Columba quickly had the body removed and reburied in consecrated ground – or, in other versions of the story, simply called for more earth to cover the body. In a Hebridean version of this tale, Odran was promised that his soul would be safe in heaven. Some time after the burial, Columba wanted to see Odran once more and opened the pit under the chapel. When Odran saw the world, he tried to climb out of his grave, but Columba had the pit covered with earth quickly to save Odran's soul from the world and its sin. These legends are one of the few instances of foundation sacrifice in Great Britain. While the story of St. Odran's self-sacrifice does not appear in Adomnán's Life of Columcille, George Henderson says that the legend points to an ancient folk-belief. He believes this is similar to the Arthurian legend of the building of Dinas Emris, where Vortigern was counseled to find and sacrifice \\"a child without a father\\" to ensure that the fortress walls did not collapse.Henderson, George (1911). Survivals in Belief Among the Celts (hosted by Internet Sacred Text Archive). p. 278. Due to the similarity of the name, some people have identified Odran with Saint Odran, the first Irish Christian martyr. There is a parallel in that each man voluntarily sacrificed himself to further the work of a better-known saint. Legacy The oldest remaining church on Iona is dedicated to Saint Odran. The surrounding cemetery is called Reilig Odhráin in his memory. St. Odran is the patron saint of the parish of Silvermines, County Tipperary. He was chosen by the Vikings as patron of the city of Waterford in 1096 and later chosen as patron of the diocese.

Gruppen () for three orchestras (1955–57) is amongst the best-known compositions of German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, and is Work Number 6 in the composer's catalog of works. Gruppen is \\"a landmark in 20th-century music . . . probably the first work of the post-war generation of composers in which technique and imagination combine on the highest level to produce an undisputable masterpiece\\" . History Paspels, the village where Stockhausen began work on Gruppen Early in 1955 Stockhausen received a commission from WDR for a new orchestral composition, but his ongoing work on Gesang der Jünglinge prevented him from starting right away. In August and September, he took the opportunity to retreat to an inexpensive rented room in the attic of a parsonage in Paspels, Switzerland, recommended to him by a colleague, Paul Gredinger. Surrounded by the splendour of the Graubünden alps, he created the entire plan of Gruppen, \\"with a completely new conception of musical time\\" . The surroundings provided more than just a conducive environment for work. > in Gruppen ... whole envelopes of rhythmic blocks are exact lines of > mountains that I saw in Paspels in Switzerland right in front of my little > window. Many of the time spectra, which are represented by superimpositions > of different rhythmic layers—of different speeds in each layer—their > envelope which describes the increase and decrease of the number of layers, > their shape, so to speak, the shape of the time field, are the curves of the > mountain's contour which I saw when I looked out the window. Originally the work was to have been for multi-channel electronic music with large orchestra, with metrically indeterminate parts for the orchestra. Once having decided to divide the orchestra into three parts, each with its own conductor, Stockhausen gave up the electronic sounds and incorporated some of what had previously been thought of as electronic music into the orchestra. The indeterminate tempos also proved impractical, and were dropped after a few experimental pages of score had been written out . Upon returning to Cologne, Stockhausen resumed work on Gesang der Jünglinge and then composed the wind quintet Zeitmaße and Klavierstück XI, before turning to working-out the details of Gruppen, which occupied him for all of 1957. The premiere of the work took place in the Rheinsaal of the Kölner Messe in Cologne-Deutz, as part of the WDR's concert series Musik der Zeit, on 24 March 1958 with the Cologne Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Stockhausen (orchestra I), Bruno Maderna (orchestra II), and Pierre Boulez (orchestra III). The score is dedicated to Herbert Eimert, director at that time of the WDR electronic music studio . Gruppen was performed twice on the programme, with the world premiere of Pierre Boulez's Third Piano Sonata, performed by the composer, in between . Material and form A large orchestra of 109 players is divided into three orchestral units, each with its own conductor, which are deployed in a horseshoe shape to the left, front, and right of the audience. The spatial separation was principally motivated by the compositional requirement of keeping simultaneously played yet musically separate passages distinct from one another , but led to some orgiastic passages in which a single musical process passes from one orchestra to another. The title refers to the work's construction in 174 units, mainly composed in what Stockhausen terms \\"groups\\"—cohesive groupings of notes unified through one or more common characteristics (dynamics, instrumental color, register, etc.): \\"a particular number of notes which are joined, by means of related proportions, into a superordinate experiential quality (namely, the group). The various groups in a composition have various proportional features—various structures—but they are interrelated in that the properties of one group may only be understood by comparing them in degree of relationship with the other groups\\" . This category is contrasted with the \\"punctual\\" style of early Darmstadt serialism, which nevertheless also occurs in Gruppen, along with a third category of \\"collective\\" or \\"statistical\\" swarms or crowds, too dense for the listener to be able to accurately distinguish individual notes or their order of succession . Consequently, the importance of individual notes is relatively low, so that sonority, density, speed, dynamics, and direction of movement become the main features for the listener . Nonetheless, a traditional twelve- tone row is used as its basis: Gruppen tone row (; ; ; , and show this row transposed up a tritone). See tone row for Klavierstück IX. This is a symmetrical all-interval row, in which the first half consists of the intervals of a descending major third, rising perfect fourth, descending minor third, descending minor second, and ascending major second. The second half consists of the retrograde of the first half, transposed by a tritone . In other words, the row is \\"degenerate\\", in that the second hexachord is a retrograde of the first, transposed by six semitones. However, Stockhausen does not exploit the specific twelve-tone compositional applications of such a row, which suggests that either Stockhausen was not interested in or did not know about them . Because of the chord transformations that emerge between rehearsal numbers 118 and 120 it appears that Stockhausen was in fact aware of these properties, making it most likely that the relationship simply did not interest him compositionally . Many of the conceptual bases of the work are explained in Stockhausen's famous article, \\"... How Time Passes ...\\" . In this essay, Stockhausen developed a serial organizational principle at the center of which stood the concept of a twelve-step duration series possessing the same structural properties as the basic twelve-tone pitch series. This became the basis for the entire process of serial organization of Gruppen . This duration series, however, is expressed not as single units (which would correspond to single vibrations of a pitch) but rather as metronomic tempos in sufficiently long stretches of time to enable conductors and musicians to change tempo with precision. However, because the resulting \\"fundamental durations\\" are not small enough for use in the musical detail, subdivisions corresponding to the transposition of the overtones of a pitch's harmonic spectrum are used . The twelve logarithmic metronomic tempos used in Gruppen, covering a tempo \\"octave\\" (doubling in speed) from = 60 to 120 are : The composer recalled that, when Igor Stravinsky saw the score for the first time, he wrote that such fractional metronomic values as 63.5 and 113.5 were \\"a sign of German thoroughness\\" .

At these temperatures the atom's quantum-mechanical properties become important. To reach such low temperatures, a combination of several techniques typically has to be used. First, atoms are usually trapped and pre-cooled via laser cooling in a magneto-optical trap. To reach the lowest possible temperature, further cooling is performed using evaporative cooling in a magnetic or optical trap. Several Nobel prizes in physics are related to the development of the techniques to manipulate quantum properties of individual atoms (e.g. 1995-1997, 2001, 2005, 2012, 2017). Experiments with ultracold atoms study a variety of phenomena, including quantum phase transitions, Bose–Einstein condensation (BEC), bosonic superfluidity, quantum magnetism, many-body spin dynamics, Efimov states, Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) superfluidity and the BEC–BCS crossover. Some of these research directions utilize ultracold atom systems as quantum simulators to study the physics of other systems, including the unitary Fermi gas and the Ising and Hubbard models. History Samples of ultracold atoms are typically prepared through the interactions of a dilute gas with a laser field. Evidence for radiation pressure, force due to light on atoms, was demonstrated independently by Lebedev, and Nichols and Hull in 1901. In 1933, Otto Frisch demonstrated the deflection of individual sodium particles by light generated from a sodium lamp. The invention of the laser spurred the development of additional techniques to manipulate atoms with light. Using laser light to cool atoms was first proposed in 1975 by taking advantage of the Doppler effect to make the radiation force on an atom dependent on its velocity, a technique known as Doppler cooling. Similar ideas were also proposed to cool samples of trapped ions. Applying Doppler cooling in three dimensions will slow atoms to velocities that are typically a few cm/s and produce what is known as an optical molasses. Typically, the source of neutral atoms for these experiments were thermal ovens which produced atoms at temperatures of a few hundred kelvins. The atoms from these oven sources are moving at hundred of meters per second. One of the major technical challenges in Doppler cooling was increasing the amount of time an atom can interact with the laser light. This challenge was overcome by the introduction of a Zeeman Slower. A Zeeman Slower uses a spatially varying magnetic field to maintain the relative energy spacing of the atomic transitions involved in Doppler cooling. This increases the amount of time the atom spends interacting with the laser light. The development of the first magneto-optical trap (MOT) by Raab et al. in 1987 was an important step towards the creation of samples of ultracold atoms. Typical temperatures achieved with a MOT are tens to hundreds of microkelvins. In essence, a magneto optical trap confines atoms in space by applying a magnetic field so that lasers not only provide a velocity dependent force but also a spatially varying force. The 1997 Nobel prize in physics was awarded for development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light and was shared by Steven Chu, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji and William D. Phillips. Evaporative cooling was used in experimental efforts to reach lower temperatures in an effort to discover a new state of matter predicted by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein known as a Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC). In evaporative cooling, the hottest atoms in a sample are allowed to escape which reduces the average temperature of the sample. The Nobel Prize in 2001 was awarded to Eric A. Cornell, Wolfgang Ketterle and Carl E. Wieman for the achievement of Bose–Einstein condensate in dilute gases of alkali atoms, and for early fundamental studies of the properties of the condensates. Applications Ultracold atoms have a variety of applications owing to their unique quantum properties and the great experimental control available in such systems. For instance, ultracold atoms have been proposed as a platform for quantum computation and quantum simulation, accompanied by very active experimental research to achieve these goals. Quantum simulation is of great interest in the context of condensed matter physics, where it may provide valuable insights into the properties of interacting quantum systems. The ultracold atoms are used to implement an analogue of the condensed matter system of interest, which can then be explored using the tools available in the particular implementation. Since these tools may differ greatly from those available in the actual condensed matter system, one can thus experimentally probe otherwise inaccessible quantities. Furthermore, ultracold atoms may even allow to create exotic states of matter, which cannot otherwise be observed in nature. Ultracold atoms are also used in experiments for precision measurements enabled by the low thermal noise and, in some cases, by exploiting quantum mechanics to exceed the standard quantum limit. In addition to potential technical applications, such precision measurements may serve as tests of our current understanding of physics.

It was originally built as a freight line to serve the prison of Ushuaia, specifically to transport timber. It now operates as a heritage railway into the Tierra del Fuego National Park and is considered the southernmost functioning railway in the world. History Origins Train carrying jail staff, 1920 Rail tracks into the forest, 1920 Train with passengers, 1930 Convicts adjusting a locomotive, 1931 In the late 19th century, Ushuaia on Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego developed as a penal colony, with the first prisoners arriving in 1884. In 1902, work began on a proper set of buildings for the prison by inmates, and a railway on wooden rails was constructed to assist the transport of materials, mainly local rock, sand and timber. Oxen pulled wagons along the narrow gauge of less than . In 1909, the prison governor informed the government of the need to upgrade the line and Decauville tracks at a narrow gaugeRailways of the Far South - The Ushuaia prison railway & the FCAF were laid in 1909 and 1910 for use with a steam locomotive. They connected the prison camp with the forestry camp and passed along the shoreline in front of the growing town of Ushuaia. It was known as the 'Train of the Prisoners' (Tren de los Presos) and brought wood for heating and cooking as well as building. The railway was gradually extended further into the forest into more remote areas as wood was exhausted. It followed the valley of the Pipo River into the higher terrain. Constant building allowed expansion of the prison and of the town, with prisoners providing many services and goods. In 1947 the Prison was closed and replaced with a naval base. Two years later the 1949 Tierra del Fuego earthquake blocked much of the line. Nevertheless, the government made efforts to clear the line and put the train back in service despite the absence of the prisoners. However the service was not viable and closed in 1952. Rebirth as a tourist railway In 1994, the railway was rebuilt in track gauge and began services again, although now in luxury relative to its origin as a prison train, with champagne and dinner services. A new 2-6-2T steam locomotive (Camila) was brought from England in 1995 with another made in Argentina and three diesel locomotives also serving on the line. Two Garratts, in Porta's improved version, have also been procured. Services leave from the 'End of the World' station (about 10 km west of Ushuaia's Airport and immediately west of the Ushuaia Golf Club). The route takes passengers along the Pico Valley in the Toro gorge and to Cascada de la Macarena station where visitors are able to learn about the Yámana people and climb to a viewpoint at a 15-minute stop. The train then enters the national park and the forest, travelling through the valley below the mountains, reaching El Parque station where tourists can return by coach or train. There is a plan to extend the line to a new station closer to Ushuaia and connect the station to the city with a tram.

The institution is primarily focused on post college-aged students and is part of the Ohr Torah Stone educational institutions founded by Rabbi Shlomo Riskin and Rabbi Chaim Brovender.http://www.ohrtorahstone.org.il/inst.htm Yeshivat Hamivtar is closely associated with the Modern Orthodox and Religious Zionist/Dati Leumi schools of contemporary Orthodox Judaism. The Yeshiva emphasizes teaching its students how to become more independent learners, especially in Talmud. It caters to both students with strong religious backgrounds, and students adopting a more observant lifestyle. It is located just outside the southern gate of Efrat, between the city and the Kibbutz Migdal Oz - located in a campus called Kiryat Shoshana. Programs The institution has a non- rabbinical and rabbinical track. Students who do not opt for the rabbinical track often enter other Yeshivot or the workforce in Israel or other countries. Rabbinical/Semicha Program Students accepted into the Semicha program (ordination) are required to spend three-years studying Halacha in the afternoon seder, in addition to the morning seder of Gemara with the rest of the Yeshiva. The three years' study consists of: Shabbat, Nidah, and Issur v'Heter. Other classes in the track include Hashkafa (questions relating to \\"worldview\\") and Practical Rabbinics; a mandatory beki'ut (survey / overview) program in Talmud was instituted beginning with the 2008-2009 year. Yeshiva Program The Yeshiva program, for students not focused on Semicha, has a wide array of classes. A seder of Talmud in the morning, followed in the afternoon by Halacha (Jewish law), Machshava (Jewish philosophy), Navi, and Chumash. The curriculum is designed to produce well rounded graduates, capable of learning on their own in the original text. Some students may start out in the Yeshiva program and progress into the Semicha program.  History  Brovender founded Yeshivat Hamivtar in Givat HaMivtar in 1967 as a spinoff of Yeshivas Itri. The goal of the institution was to create a unique learning center with a dual emphasis on intellectual openness and the systematic teaching of Talmud and other texts. Brovender had been teaching at Darche Noam and left with ten-students to found the new Yeshiva including Rabbi David Fink and Professor Charles Manekin. In 1985, Yeshivat Hamivtar became part of the network of educational institutions founded by Riskin called Ohr Torah Stone. At which point Rabbi Riskin became co-Rosh Yeshiva. Rabbi Shuki Reich led the program to train advanced students for Rabbinic Ordination. Yeshiva Hamivtar previously offered a post-high school \\"gap program\\"; in 2001 this was discontinued, allowing the Yeshiva to focus on the needs of the post-college students. Ohr Torah that same year created Yeshivat Torat Shraga which became its post high school program, led by Rabbis Brovender and Ebner. Rabbi Brovender then returned fully to Yeshivat Hamivtar. In 1997 The Yeshiva changed its name to Yeshivat Hamivtar-Orot Lev. In early 2007, Brovender left the yeshiva to focus on developing his organization for Jewish educational initiatives, Atid, and especially its latest project called WebYeshiva. Rabbi Joel Zeff succeeded Brovender as Rosh Yeshiva. During Zeff's three-year tenure educational and administrative changes were made that brought considerable expansion of the Yeshiva's enrollment and vibrancy. In Elul 2010 Rabbi Yonatan Rosensweig became the new Rosh Yeshiva. The name of the yeshivah changed again, this time to Yeshivat Torat Yosef-Hamivatar. The new leadership of the yeshiva is especially intent on actualizing the institution's great potential to serve the many students desirous of a serious yeshiva experience in a Modern Orthodox-Religious Zionist environment, as well as committed to Riskin's dream of creating truly Modern Orthodox rabbis. In 2012 the program closed.

The Black Spur is a road between the towns of Healesville and Narbethong in Victoria, Australia. It is also known as Black Spur Drive, and is part of the Maroondah Highway. Location The Black Spur is located about 60 km. east-north-east of Melbourne, on the Maroondah Highway, between Healesville and Marysville. To reach the Black Spur, you have to travel along the Eastern Arterial to Ringwood Bypass, then turn left at Maroondah Highway until you arrive at Healesville. Alternatively, you can travel through Cardinia Reservoir to Emerald, then to Yarra Junction and Warburton. Etymology The road, originally known as \\"The Blacks' Spur\\", gained its name from the route taken by displaced Aboriginal people from northern Victoria on their way to a settlement at Corranderrk near Healesville.  History  During the mid-1890s depression the successful Melbourne photographer John William Lindt closed his studio. As early as 1883 he had been exhibiting pictures of the Blacks' Spur, and there he built and moved to a guesthouse ‘The Hermitage’ in gardens set out by his friend Ferdinand von Mueller, and featuring New Guinea tree houses from which he made frequent panoramas of his property and surrounding primeval forest of towering, 30-metre mountain ash. There he continued his photography in a studio 30m x 8m, with a wall glazed in ground glass. In it he photographed guests, of whom he also made outdoor portraits in the bush setting, and projected lantern slides for their entertainment. In 1913 he collaborated with Nicholas Caire to produce a tourist booklet on the area. Though he suffered from anti-German sentiment during and after WW1, and had to defend himself when a public meeting was called at the local shire council hall to demand that he be sent to an internment camp, Lindt continued to sell prints from his older glass negatives and from new photographs he took of his forest home, guests in his gardens, and genre scenes, numbers of which are accessible on the sites of State Library of Victoria, State Library of New South Wales, National Gallery of Australia, National Library of Australia, and the National Gallery of Victoria. In 1925 the Argus reported that Lindt “continues to produce remarkable and most artistic pictures of the beauties of mountain landscape...he is a master of detail.”The Argus, 19 March 1925 Aged 81M. McLardy, ‘Our oldest living photographer’, Australasian Photo-Review, Sept 1947 Lindt died of heart failure during disastrous bushfires on 19 February 1926 at the Hermitage, though the buildings survived.Valerie Frost, 'Lindt, John William (1845–1926)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, Volume 5, (MUP), 1974 He was survived by his wife Catherine who continued to run ‘The Hermitage’ guest house before she retired to the city. In the early 1930s, Joan Anderson purchased the property, maintaining it as a guest house until the 1950s after which the condition of the property deteriorated until in 1979 it was sold and restored, and reopened as a guest house in 1988. In 2009, a large section of Black Spur was damaged during the Black Saturday bushfires. In 2019, Melbourne woman Angie Suryadi was killed on the Black Spur when a large tree fell on her family's car during strong winds. Her four year old son was injured. Description of road The road is excellent after its resurfacing in August 2006 with smooth hot-mix and road widening that also took place later that same year. It is twisty with a series of hairpin turns punctuated by short straights. A few corners are prone to dampness due to the ferny rainforest surroundings. The scenery is beautiful with tall mountain ash trees and tree ferns, the typical of southeastern Australia's temperate rainforests. Statistics * Length (km): 30 (about * Corner Ratio: 80% * Corner Speeds: 35–60 km/h * Legal Speed Limit: 80 km/h * Traffic (cars/min): 2–5 * Bumpiness: Smooth some corrugation * Bitumen Grip: Very grippy * Special Notes: Rainforest means often damp and bark on road in winter and firestorms in summer. Street Racing The road is a known as a Tōge-racing spot where amateur racers, often in tuned/modified cars, are driving back and forth at high speed late at night. In March 2008, the Victorian state government allocated $547,000 to improve road safety on the Black Spur. Stage 1 of the works has involved reducing the speed limit from 100 km/h to 80 km/h, effective Thursday 29 May 2008.

The organization owns and manages 44 nature preserves—totaling more than 23,000 acres—located in 13 counties in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Nineteen of the preserves are open to the public for recreational use; the others have limited visitation due to the presence of sensitive ecosystems or limited facilities. Background In addition to owning and managing preserves, Natural Lands preserves land by working with private land owners to establish and enforce conservation easements. A conservation easement is a voluntary but legally binding agreement that permanently limits a property's use. To date, the organization holds easements on more than 22,000 acres. Natural Lands also provides a range of consulting services to Pennsylvania municipalities (152 municipalities in 26 counties, to date). These services include redrafting a township's zoning ordinances to incorporate open space, thereby using development to save land. Natural Lands has been accredited by the Land Trust Accreditation Commission, an independent program of the Land Trust Alliance, which endorses a land trust's ability to “operate in an ethical, legal, and technically sound manner and ensure the long-term protection of land in the public interest.” To date, Natural Lands has saved more than 125,000 acres of land in its nearly 64-year history. This is equal to about half the total acreage of Pennsylvania's state park system. Mission Natural Lands is a non-profit organization that saves open space, cares for nature, and connects people to the outdoors in eastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey. More than 2.5 million people live within five miles of lands under the organization's permanent protection. The organization's approach to conservation includes: * Saving open space - Permanently protecting natural areas using acquisition and conservation easements and by helping growing communities preserve more of their land * Caring for nature - Providing leadership in managing natural resources on its preserves and sharing its expertise with other landowners * Connecting People to the Outdoors - Creating opportunities for people to connect with and learn from nature History Natural Lands' founder Allston Jenkins Natural Lands was founded in 1953 as the Philadelphia Conservationists, Inc., by a group of birdwatchers who wanted to protect what is now the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge, a tidal freshwater marsh in Tinicum Township, Pennsylvania. Led by Allston Jenkins, a local accountant who was new to birding when he founded the organization, The Philadelphia Conservationists achieved their goal of protecting the Tinicum Marsh from being filled with sediment dredged from nearby waterways by the following year. Allston Jenkins (1903-1994) became Natural Lands' first president and executive director, and was an active member within the organization until his death. As the Philadelphia Conservationists, the organization worked to preserve land up and down the East Coast and beyond – however, they would usually turn the land that they preserved over to government agencies and other non-profits. In 1959, the organization created its first nature preserve. Sharp's Woods Preserve in Chester County, Pennsylvania, had 28 acres, and is still owned and stewarded by the organization today. In 1961, the members of The Philadelphia Conservationists established themselves as Natural Lands Trust, Inc., as a means of being able to permanently own and preserve the land that came under their care. The same year, they received its first donation of land, now the Willisbrook Preserve in Willistown Township, Pennsylvania. In 2017, the non- profit shortened its name to Natural Lands. Natural Lands has continued to acquire and steward open land in eastern Pennsylvania and in southern New Jersey in the interest of preserving open spaces and native habitats and ensuring that residents of Pennsylvania and New Jersey benefit from open spaces in perpetuity. In addition to acquiring land outright for preservation and stewardship, Natural Lands has also been responsible for conservation easements on 20,000 acres of land. The organization's first easement was the Upper Main Line YMCA in Chester County, Pennsylvania, in 1966, which was the first known conservation easement in Pennsylvania. Since its incorporation in 1961, Natural Lands has saved more than 125,000 acres of land from being developed. Natural Lands' headquarters are located at the 55-acre Hildacy Preserve in Media, Pennsylvania since 1981. Programs and Services Growing Greener: Conservation by Design Growing Greener: Conservation by Design is a program that Natural Lands launched in 1997 to help Pennsylvanian municipalities and independent developers conserve open space, preserve property assets, promote interconnected greenway networks, and maximize the quality of residents’ living conditions during the development process. The communities that have adopted Growing Greener Conservation by Design ordinances are currently setting aside an average of 62 percent of the land in new developments as open space. Force of Nature Force of Nature® is Natural Lands' volunteer program, launched in 2011. Those selected for the program participate in an in-depth training program that covers a variety of land management and restoration techniques. Following training, program graduates apply their knowledge as skilled volunteers with Natural Lands.

These provisions vary from one jurisdiction to another, and may include the ability of a creditor to put a lien on a debtor's property, to effect a seizure and forced sale of the debtor's property, to effect a garnishment of the debtor's wages, and to have certain purchases or gifts made by the debtor set aside as fraudulent conveyances. The rights of a particular creditor usually depend in part on the reason for which the debt is owed, and the terms of any writing memorializing the debt. Priority of creditors Creditors' rights deal not only with the rights of creditors against the debtor, but also with the rights of creditors against one another. Where multiple creditors claim a right to levy against a particular piece of property, or against the debtor's accounts in general, the rules governing creditor's rights determine which creditor has the strongest right to any particular relief. Generally, creditors can be divided between those who \\"perfected\\" their interest by establishing an appropriate public record of the debt and any property claimed as collateral for it, and those who have not. Creditors may also be classed according to whether they are \\"in possession\\" of the collateral, and by whether the debt was created as a purchase money security interest. A creditor may generally ask a court to set aside a fraudulent conveyance designed to move the debtor's property or funds out of their reach. Specialized legal practices Some lawyers have a specialized practice area focused on the collection of such debts. Such attorneys are frequently referred to as collection attorneys or collection lawyers. Attorneys who practice in the area of \\"creditor's rights\\" perform one or all of the following: *File lawsuits and using other legal collection techniques to collect consumer debts (i.e., debts owed by individuals) *File lawsuits and using other legal collection techniques to collect commercial debts (i.e. debts owed by businesses) *Represent creditor's interests in a bankruptcy proceeding *Foreclose homes or commercial real estate if the purchaser defaults on payment *Recover (or replevin) secured goods (e.g., automobiles) if the purchaser defaults on payment References See also * Accounts receivable * Bankruptcy law * Collection agency * Contract law * Contribution claim (legal) * Creditor * Debtor * Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Contract law Common law legal terminology Credit Bankruptcy Bankruptcy law legal terminology Contract law legal terminology zh:債權 ","title":"Creditors' rights"},{"id":"6393586","text":"Lithograph of Perrot's Pas de Quatre featuring Carlotta Grisi, Marie Taglioni, Lucille Grahn, and Fanny Cerrito.

It was performed by Lucile Grahn, Carlotta Grisi, Fanny Cerrito, and Marie Taglioni, four celebrated ballerinas of the time. Fanny Elssler was invited to take part in its creation but declined to do so. Young Lucile Grahn accepted without hesitation. * 1895. Swan Lake, act 2, choreography by Lev Ivanov, music by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Danse des petits cygnes (aka Dance of the Little Swans).

Technically not a pure pas de quatre, as the four characters are accompanied by a corps de ballet. At its premier, the four principals were Maude Lloyd (Caroline), Hugh Laing (Her Lover), Antony Tudor (The Man She Must Marry), and Peggy van Praagh (An Episode in His Past). * 1949. The Moor's Pavane, choreography by José Limón, music by Henry Purcell. Based on Shakespeare's Othello.

The Osage Plains are a physiographic section of the larger Central Lowland province, which in turn is part of the larger Interior Plains physiographic division. The area is sometimes called the Lower Plains, North Central Plains,or Rolling Plains. The Osage Plains, covering west-central Missouri, the southeastern third of Kansas, most of central Oklahoma, and extending into north-central Texas, is the southernmost of three tallgrass prairie physiographic areas. It grades into savanna and woodland to the east and south, and into shorter, mixed-grass prairie to the west. The Osage Plains consist of three subregions. The Osage Plains proper occupy the northeast segment. Although sharply demarcated from the Ozark uplift, the plains are nonetheless a transitional area across which the boundary between prairie and woodland has shifted over time. In the central portion of the physiographic area lies the second subregion, the Flint Hills, commonly called \\"the Osage\\" in Oklahoma. This large remnant core of native tallgrass prairie is a rocky rolling terrain that runs from north to south across Kansas and extends into Oklahoma. To the west and south of these hills are the Blackland Prairies and Cross Timbers. This vegetatively complex region of intermixed prairie and scrubby juniper-mesquite woodland extends into north-central Texas. Bluestem prairies and oak-dominated savannas and woodlands characterize the natural vegetation in the Cross Timbers. Much of the area has been converted to agriculture, although expanses of oak forest and woodland are still scattered throughout the eastern portion of the subregion. Birds in the Osage Plains include the threatened greater prairie- chicken, Henslow's sparrow, dickcissel, loggerhead shrike, field sparrow, scissor-tailed flycatcher, Bell's vireo, painted bunting, and Harris's sparrow. Wildfire suppression, overgrazing, and the spread of exotic plants are the factors most negatively affecting priority bird habitat. The area now is managed almost exclusively for beef production with annual burns and intensive grazing practices that provide little of the habitat structure required to support many priority bird species. Historically, fire, drought, and plains bison were dominant ecological forces and had great influences on the vegetation from local to landscape scales. The Osage Plains and Flint Hills were dominated historically by tallgrass prairie with scattered groves of blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica) in the uplands and along drainages. A variety of wetland types, including wet prairie, marshes, and northern floodplain forests occurred along larger rivers. Today, much of the land in the Osage Plains is planted to corn and soybeans, or has been converted to non-native grasses for pasture and hay. Large expanses of tallgrass prairie remain in the Flint Hills, where relief is greater than in the Osage Plains subregion and the land less suitable for cropping. Geology The Osage Plains are underlain by soft shales with interbedded sandstones and limestones of late Mississippian to Pennsylvanian ages. Some of the rocks prevalent in the Osage Plains are Mississippian limestone, limestone shale, Ordovician dolomite, and Pennsylvanian coal. Also, clay and shale are found within the Pennsylvanian bedrock. The area contained two major mining areas. The biggest was the Tri-State lead and zinc region, consisting of nearly . This was the largest concentration of zinc deposits anywhere in the world. Most mining sites have closed, mainly due to health and other environmental issues. More than $1 billion worth of lead and zinc were extracted from the area during the active mining days. The other major mining was for bituminous coal. Due to air quality standards, this region's coal is in low demand due to its high sulfur content.

It then became a mixed-sex middle school in 1977. As a 20th- century grammar school it took a number of boarders who lived at Wheaton Aston Hall, and taught agricultural science. The school had a small attached farm with cattle and poultry. The original building does not survive. The earliest part of the remaining buildings, originally two houses donated to the school, dates from 1778. In 1799 these were enclosed in the school grounds by moving the road. They were rebuilt in 1856 as Rushall House (now Grade II listed) and used as a schoolroom and dormitories. In 1863 the headmaster's house was rebuilt, and further extensions to the school were made in 1898, 1926, 1935, and 1952. The school is commemorated in a recent memorial window in the nearby parish church, St Mary and St Chad. Notable staff William Budworth (1699–1745) was headmaster here and declined to employ Samuel Johnson References *Brewood, David Horovitz, 1988, *Brewood and Penkridge in Old Photographs, Adrienne Whitehouse, 1988, Educational institutions established in the 15th century Defunct schools in Staffordshire Grade II listed buildings in Staffordshire Defunct grammar schools in England Grade II listed educational buildings 1450s establishments in England Educational institutions disestablished in 1975 1975 disestablishments in England ","title":"Brewood Grammar School"},{"id":"6393628","text":"View from Gunung Lambak looking west, 1975 Mount Lambak () is a small mountain in Kluang District, Johor, Malaysia.

Eizo Shimabukuro (1925-2017) dropped the Chatan Yara no Kusanku and the Oyadamari no Passai he learned from Chotoku Kyan and he added Kusanku Sho and Dai and Passai Sho and Dai of Yasutsune Itosu lineage. It is said that Eizo Shimabukuro learned these Itosu kata as well as Pinan Shodan to Godan and Naihanchin Shodan to Sandan from Choshin Chibana. However, in his book \\"Okinawa Karatedo Old Grandmaster Stories\\" Eizo Shimabukuro says that Chibana was too old to teach and so Chibana referred Shimabukuro to his senior student, Nakazato, for instruction. Eizo Shimabuku also added two kata from his time in Goju-ryu with Chojun Miyagi. These kata being Seiunchin and Sanchin (Eizo Shimabukuro used to call his version of Sanchin, Sanchu).  History  Although Chinese martial arts began spreading to Okinawa in the 14th century, it was not prominent until the 18th century, when Kusanku, a Chinese military official, visited Okinawa and gave a demonstration. In subsequent visits, he started teaching \\"chuan fa\\" (meaning \\"fist way\\") to Okinawans. Kanga Sakukawa blended Kusanku's Chuan Fa with indigenous Okinawan martial arts to form the first martial art style called karate. His student Sokon Matsumura blended Sakugawa's style with Shaolin kung fu to form Shuri-Te karate. Matsumura was Anko Itosu's primary instructor, and both Matsumura and Itosu instructed Chotoku Kyan and Choki Motobu. Several of Kyan's students would go on to lead their own branches of karate. These are: Shoshin Nagamine (Matsubayashi-ryu), Tatsuo Shimabukuro (Isshin-ryu), Eizo Shimabukuro (Shobayashi Shorin Ryu), Joen Nakazato (Shorinji-ryu), and Zenryo Shimabukuro (Shorin-ryu Seibukan). Eizo Shimabukuro studied under Chojun Miyagi before taking up Shuri-Te under Chotoku Kyan. Although Kyan then became his primary instructor, Shimabukuro also studied under Choki Motobu and weapons under Taira Shinken. In 1959 at the Kodokan in Japan, Kanken Tōyama promoted Eizo Shimabukuro to 10th Dan. At the age of 34, Shimabukuro was the youngest person ever to receive such an honor. Tatsuo was senior to Eizo and when he started Isshinryu, Eizo took over. Eizo studied often with his older brother Tatsuo, which may explain why the kata are so similar and Eizo retained Sanchin and Seiunchin Shōrin-ryū ","title":"Shōbayashi Shōrin-ryū"},{"id":"6393641","text":"Flannán mac Toirrdelbaig was an Irish saint who lived in the 7th century and was the son of an Irish chieftain, Toirdhealbhach of Dál gCais.

R. Gurney. It premiered at the Williamstown Theatre Festival and later enjoyed a Broadway production at the Music Box Theatre during the 1986-87 season. Characters The play requires four actors for its two characters, Susan Weatherhill, a repressed and uncertain woman in her late forties, and Jake, a young man who is the college roommate of Susan's son. Each of these characters is played simultaneously by two actors, who give expression to the characters' internal tensions and ambivalence. The script refers to them as: \\"Susan\\", \\"Susan Too\\", \\"Jake\\", and \\"Jake Too\\". This technique of dividing a single character between two actors is not unique to Sweet Sue; it can also be found in Overtones (1913 and 1929) by Alice Gerstenberg, Getting Out (1979) by Marsha Norman, and Passion (1981) by Peter Nichols. Here, Gurney uses it to create an atmosphere of light romantic comedy, punctuated by moments of unease. Analysis Gurney has explained that the play was initially meant to be a modern treatment of the classical tale of Phaedra and her desire for a younger man, but turned into a summer romance, with Susan's struggling with problems of self-esteem, artistic integrity, and sexual attraction to a man young enough to be her son. Reviewers tended to dismiss the play as superficial and far from Gurney's best, but it ran for six months on Broadway, due in part to the casting of the two Sues with the popular actors Mary Tyler Moore and Lynn Redgrave.

A reasonable level of physical fitness is required to climb/trek Mount Korbu. It used to take an average climber four days and three nights for a return trip, but the duration are being cut short in recent years and some have even made it within 12 hours. Most climbers now do without any guide as the trail has become very obvious (at some stretches even badly deteriorated due to over-trekked), but, as for other local mountains, there are occasional reports of climbers getting lost. Mount Gayong (2,173 m), the fourth highest mountain in Peninsular Malaysia, can be reached in about a 90-minute (one way) trek from the peak of Mount Korbu.

It is defined by the ETSI’s GSM committee and 3GPP and is part of the 2G, 3G, 4G LTE (telecommunication) and 5G standards. It is also known as Short Message Service-Cell Broadcast (SMS-CB). Unlike Short Message Service-Point to Point (SMS-PP), Cell Broadcast is a one-to-many geo-targeted and geo-fenced messaging service. History Cell Broadcast messaging was first demonstrated in Paris in 1997. Some mobile operators used Cell Broadcast for communicating the area code of the antenna cell to the mobile user (via channel 050), for nationwide or citywide alerting, weather reports, mass messaging, location- based news, etc. Cell broadcast has been widely deployed since 2008 by major Asian, US, Canadian, South American and European network operators. Not all operators have the Cell Broadcast messaging function activated in their network yet, but most of the currently used handsets support cell broadcast. Service One Cell Broadcast message can reach a large number of telephones at once. Cell Broadcast messages are directed to radio cells, rather than to a specific telephone. The latest generation of Cell Broadcast Systems (CBS) can send to the whole mobile network (e.g. 1,000,000 cells) in less than 10 seconds, reaching millions of mobile subscribers at the same time. A Cell Broadcast message is an unconfirmed push service, meaning that the originators of the messages do not know who has received the message, allowing for services based on anonymity. Cell Broadcast is compliant with the latest EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as mobile phone numbers are not required by CB. The originator (alerting authority) of the Cell Broadcast message can request the success rate of a message. In such a case the Cell Broadcast System will respond with the number of addressed cells and the number of cells that have broadcast the Cell broadcast (alert) message. Technology The maximum length of a cell broadcast message is 1395 characters. The CB message parameters contain the broadcasting schedule. If the start-time is left open, the CBC system will assume an immediate start, which will be the case for Public Warning messages. If the end-time is left open, the message will be repeated indefinitely. A subsequent cancel message shall be used to stop this message. The repetition rate can be set between 2 seconds and to values beyond 30 minutes. Each repeated CB message will have the same message identifier (indicating the source of the message), and the same serial number. Using this information, the mobile telephone is able to identify and ignore broadcasts of already received messages. A Cell Broadcast message page is composed of 82 octets, which, using the default character set, can encode 93 characters. Up to 15 of these pages may be concatenated to form a Cell Broadcast message (hence maximum length of one Cell broadcast message is therefore 1395 characters). A Cell Broadcast Centre (CBC), a system which is the source of SMS-CB, is connected to a Base Station Controller (BSC) in GSM networks, to a Radio Network Controller (RNC) in UMTS networks, to a Mobility Management Entity (MME) in LTE (telecommunication) networks or to a core Access and Mobility management Function (AMF) in 5G networks. The technical implementation of the cell broadcast service is described in the 3GPP specification TS 23.041 Technical realization of Cell Broadcast Service (CBS) *The 2G-CBC (BSC) interface is described in 3GPP standard TS 48.049; however, non-standard implementations exist. *The 3G-CBC (RNC) interface is described in 3GPP standard TS 25.419. *The 4G-CBC (MME) interface is described in 3GPP standard TS 29.168. *The 5G-CBC (AMF) interface is described in 3GPP standard TS 29.518. A CBC sends CB messages, a list of cells where messages are to be broadcast, and the requested repetition rate and number of times they shall be broadcast to the BSC/RNC/MME/AMF. The BSC's/RNC's/MME/AMF responsibility is to deliver the CB messages to the base station (BTSs), NodeBs, ENodeBs and gNodeBs which handle the requested cells. Emergency communication system Cell Broadcast is not affected by traffic load; therefore, it is very suitable during a disaster when load spikes of data (social media and mobile app), regular SMS and voice calls usage (mass call events) tend to significantly congest mobile networks, as multiple events have shown. Wireless Emergency Alerts and Government alerts using Cell Broadcast are supported in all models of mobile telephones. Smart phones have a configuration menu that offer opt-out capabilities for certain public warning severity levels. Broadcast messages are used in most countries to send emergency alerts, using as input a CAP (Common Alerting Protocol) message as specified by OASIS (organization) or Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) C-interface protocol, which has been specified jointly by the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) and the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA). Advantages of using Cell Broadcast for Public warning are: * Sending out a Cell Broadcast message to a few or millions of people take less than 10 seconds * Cell Broadcast has a unique and dedicated ringtone and vibration * Only an authorized authority and the serving mobile network are able to send out the Cell Broadcast messages * 99% of all handsets used today support Cell Broadcast * Cell Broadcast supports per CB-message a maximum message length of 1395 characters in Latin and 615 characters in Universal Coded Character Set (UCS-2) encoding in order to support e.g. Arabic, Chinese alphabet, Urdu, Greek alphabet. * Cell Broadcast supports multiple languages * Cell Broadcast supports the use of URLs and Web-links in the alert message * Cell Broadcast supports Device Based Geo-Fencing * Cell Broadcast supports the update within seconds of existing alert messages due to changing hazard situations * Cell Broadcast supports the mechanism to inform and instruct people within seconds in the adjacent hazard areas * Cell Broadcast is able to reach all mobile subscribers including roaming subscribers (in their own language) * Cell Broadcast is not affected by mobile network congestion * Cell Broadcast is not affected by access class baring and or SIM class baring * Cell Broadcast is not affected by any data protection constraints as no personal data (subscriber identity or MSISDN) is required and used to deliver the message. * Cell Broadcast can be used to address people present in an individual cell sector or large polygons covering a complete city or country. * Cell Broadcast messages can be updated as incident conditions change during an event at the end of an event an all-clear can be given. * Cell Broadcast is suitable for monthly or half yearly national public warning awareness tests * Cell Broadcast enablement in the mobile network has no influence on the battery life of mobile devices Cell Broadcast adoption rate A point of criticism in the past on Cell Broadcast was that there was no uniform user experience on all mobile devices in a country. This limitation is since 2012 no longer present. In case a national civil defence organisation is adopting one of the Wireless Emergency Alerts standards, WEA - formerly known as CMAS in North America, EU-Alert in Europe, LAT-Alert in South America, Earthquake Tsunami Warning System in Japan, each subscriber in that country either making use of the home network or is roaming automatically makes use of the embedded Public warning Cell Broadcast feature present in every Android (operating system) and iOS mobile device. In countries that have selected Cell Broadcast to transmit public warning messages, up to 99% of the handsets receive the cell broadcast message reaching between 85-95% of the entire population as not all people have a mobile phone within seconds after the government authorities have submitted the message see as examples Emergency Mobile Alert (New Zealand), Wireless Emergency Alerts (USA) and NL- Alert (Netherlands). Public warning implementations Many countries and regions have implemented location-based alert systems based on cell broadcast. The alert messages to the population, already broadcast by various media, are relayed over the mobile network using cell broadcast.

Countries previously trialing Cell Broadcast for public warning purposes  * UK The government of the United Kingdom established a project to evaluate options for a National Alerting Service in 2013, conducted trials in 2014. The project stopped in 2015. In 2018 the Cabinet Office commissioned a discovery report to assess the state of UK networks, review international developments with mobile alerting and the steps required to implement a service in the UK. In 2019, The Environment Agency together with Fujitsu, the Mobile Operator EE and the University of Hull explored the potential use of Cell Broadcast as an alerting channel for severe flooding. In January 2019 a Cell Broadcast message was successfully sent from the Flood Warning System over the 4G network in EE's test lab to a number of mobile devices. During 2019 the Environment Agency commissioned a survey to assess public responses to the use of Cell Broadcast messages and in November 2019 a workshop was held at the University of Hull to assess behavioural responses to Cell Broadcast messages. The results of this workshop were made available publicly.

He first appeared in Batman issue #582 (October 2000). Fictional character biography After the death of his parents, Philo Zeiss was taken in by his uncle Victor, the gardener of a Sicilian mafia lord. When his Uncle died soon after, the Sicilian took the young Zeiss in and, seeing something in the youth, prepared him for life as a killer for the mob. At first the young Philo was brought to watch mob enforcers work, then later was trained him as a mob enforcer himself. Feeling a debt to the Sicilian, Zeiss agreed to have surgery performed on his spinal column and optic nerves to enhance his perception and reflexes to superhuman levels, at the cost of needing to wear specially- designed goggles to cope with the new level of information he was receiving. As an adult, Zeiss relocated to Gotham City and became the bodyguard of Gotham mob boss Lew Moxon, developing an obsession with proving himself Batman's superior after recording Batman in a fight but forced to flee when his goggles were damaged. Returning with a new set of goggles, he attempted to engage Batman again, but Batman always found a way around Zeiss's skills, whether by giving him something else to deal with or pitting him against Batgirl when he had no experience with her skills. After a falling out with Moxon following Deadshot's assassination attempt, he took up an offer to work for \\"Junior\\" Galante. He fought against Catwoman when she impeded Junior's efforts to expand into Gotham's East Side, nearly killing her in single combat and threatening those around her. When she fought him a second time, during the War Games incident, she defeated him after he killed Lew Moxon and his bodyguard Hellhound. Zeiss' Vendetta Zeiss harbors a personal vendetta against the Batman, and considers himself a superior combatant and strategist in comparison to the Dark Knight. His single-mindedness for defeating Batman in single combat has interfered with Zeiss' success on at least two occasions: * Zeiss allowed his employer Lew Moxon to be critically injured by the assassin Deadshot when (instead of focusing on protection) Zeiss was trying to kill Batman hand-to-hand. Zeiss was subsequently relieved of his protection duties and thrown out of Moxon's mob. * After repairing his goggles (which were damaged by a batarang), after a fight against Batman, and reviewing the information he had gathered with them about Batman's combat style, Zeiss fought Batman to a standstill, boasting that he knew every move Batman would make before he made it. As in their previous battle, also this fight ends in stalemate, however, with the entry into the scene of Batgirl, who manages to hit aback Zeiss, Batman manages to deprive him of his powerful goggles. Zeiss waiver to continue the fight and decides to surrender. *In Batman #632, Batman and Zeiss fight again. Batman will win the fight, and Zeiss will be stopped and arrested. Powers and abilities Zeiss has cybernetically accelerated reflexes and his eyes and optic nerves have been altered to maximize his abilities. To this end, he wears a pair of high-tech goggles, which are wired directly to his frontal lobe. The goggles allow him to record and analyze with great detail the movements and tactics of the enemies he faces and to anticipate or emulate those tactics to a degree. This system, combined with his extensive martial-arts training, makes him a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, although his reliance on the goggles has been used against him as he is unable to operate without them.

The shells were thin walled with rings, and painted white with what they called \\"Vibrasonic\\" interiors. The lugs were essentially a copy of the Camco designs. Hayman was out of business by 1975. The company started with the name George Hayman on the badge, then shortened it to just \\"Hayman\\" in later years.  History  They were the brainchild of Ivor Arbiter who besides being the first to actually bring guitars into Britain in quantity was also the first to import Ludwig and Gretsch drums during the \\"beat boom\\". It was he who, in the sixties, cleverly identified a gap in the market for a loud drum set at a time when drummers were seldom miked-up outside of the studio. The original plan was to affix metal liners inside the shells of rather ordinary beech Carlton drums and, indeed, some of these were actually made. Ultimately they discarded the metal inserts, which were weighty and expensive and instead chose to thickly coat the drums' interior surfaces. Bingo! Loud and extremely cutting drums were here. Originally the drums were named \\"George Hayman\\" after one of the guys in Dallas-Arbiter's Shoeburyness factory (whose surname, to confuse things further, was actually Haymon) and, possibly, George Way who made the legendary Camcos. In further homage to that famous American marque, the set's lugs were also made circular, which was well avant-garde at the time. Anyway, the name was eventually shortened to the more identifiable \\"Hayman\\". The drums had a mixture of features which, prior to 1969, would only be seen on expensive American products. Triple-flange hoops, which gave a more open sound, very new to British drums, as were non-telescopic spurs, adjustable, swivelling shell mounts and cymbal arms and an abundance of tension screws and Remo heads. Dallas-Arbiter designed their own cumbersome tom holder too, which might well have looked good on the drawing board, but in reality was something of a nightmare. A flat, curved and slotted rail was jacked up a little above the bass drum shell and to this was attached the body of the cast tom holder itself. This was fitted with not one, but two ratchets and by judicious use of both you could actually have exceedingly limited horizontal height adjustment. A radial-toothed block was fixed to the tom which mated with a ratchet on the holder to maintain its playing angle, and very large capstan nuts locked tom to holder and holder to bass drum rail. These capstans had an annoying tendency to crush your fingers against the drum and were neither particularly stable nor hard wearing. But at the time, it was the best around. Hayman spurs were modelled on Ludwig type outrigger designs, but with large, cast circular holder blocks which matched the nut boxes and also located the tom legs. Hayman's 'lightning-bolt' bass drum tensioners were the first that were ergonomically designed to ease operation - they were shaped to accommodate the thumbs better. The Dallas-Arbiter company also produced pretty good double- braced, tripod-based stands and pedals called Speedamatic, which were actually a lot more substantial and sophisticated than the majority of their competition. They're no doubt still seeing service in drum sets almost a quarter of a century after their conception. The snare stand was the first in Britain to use a basket-holding mechanism while the wide, industrial-fibre- belted bass pedal and double-sprung hi-hat (both featuring easily adjustable springs) were particularly were worthy. They were more rugged than just about anything else on the market, although the extremely chunky, scalloped cast screws which arrested all the adjustable bits did leave something to be desired. Initially the Hayman snare drums all had 5½\\" deep wooden shells in common with the rest of the drums, but a year or so later aluminium-shelled versions were introduced. They were loosely modelled along the lines of Ludwig's 400, although in appearance, their shells were much more like Gretsch's. I'm told they didn't make too many metal drums so they’re evidently quite collectable. After the \\"Beverley Cosmic 21\\", Hayman were amongst the first non-American snare drums to have ten tensioners per head and boasted a simple, but effective American-style on/off strainer attached to a 22 strand snare too. Unlike the\\"21\\", they also had an American-style swivelling damper like Ludwig's.  Dating Hayman Drums  * If the badge and/or snare strainer says \\"George Hayman\\", then it is from 1968-69. * If the badge is a 4 cm brass one with \\"Hayman - then it is around 1969-73 * If the badge is smaller and silver then it is one of the last to be made during 74/75. Also, each round badge on a Hayman drum has a patent number - giving the year of manufacture within the patent number.  Sizes  Size-wise Hayman sets originally came with 22\\", 20\\" or 18\\" bass drums and 12\\", 13\\", 14\\" and 16\\" toms, but eventually 24\\", 26\\" and even 28\\" basses appeared. The jazzers of the time went for the 18\\"x 12\\", 12\\"x8\\" and 14\\"x14\\" Recording outfit, while the rockers went for the larger-sized Showmans.  Sound  The secret of the Hayman sound was in the interior coating. It was rather grandly called Vibrasonic but was simply a thickish, sprayed-on coat of ordinary white polyurethane paint (originally with an unfortunate tendency to craze). Its function was to harden the surface of the drum, allowing the sound to bounce around inside and give more \`crack'. Hayman drums didn't sound exactly warm but, for the mostly un-amplified drummers of the time, fitted the bill exactly. They cut through any sort of music at high levels.  Finishes  The original Haymans were only available in three brushed metallic finishes: Solid Silver, Gold Ingot and Midnight Blue, (Regal Red, Matt Black, Natural Pine and see-through Iceberg were introduced later) the first five of which were also used to cover refrigerators. When they were first introduced in August 1969, a five drum Showman set without stands would have cost £265. Hayman made the drum kits in three brushed metallic finishes; gold, silver, and midnight blue. They also had a 'Natural Pine' veneer finish that looked like cedar.\\"True Brits, Bob Henrit, Rhythm Magazine Users * Don Powell of Slade * Trevor Morais of The Peddlers * Michael Giles of King Crimson * Etienne Jacobs of Kremlin Picon Blues The Sparrows * Jim Capaldi of Traffic * Aynsley Dunbar in the early 1970s * Derek Ballard of A Band Called O * Bill Bruford of Yes and King Crimson * Simon Kirke of Free * Wilgar Campbell of Rory Gallagher band * Ted McKenna (until 1978) of Rory Gallagher band * John Wilson of Taste * Rob Townsend of Family * Ric Parnell of Atomic Rooster * Guy Evans of Van Der Graaf Generator * Mick Avory of The Kinks * Randy Jones of Maynard Ferguson * Paul Hammond of Atomic Rooster * Brian Bennett of The Shadows * Ronnie Verrell of the Syd Lawrence Big Band and Ted Heath Orchestra * Bob Henrit of Argent and The Kinks * Mike Zanghi of The War on Drugs * Mitch Mitchell (The Jimi Hendrix Experience) * John Densmore (The Doors without Jim Morrison in 1972 and 1973)  See also  *List of drum makers References * The Guitar Collection of Guy Mackenzie includes pictures of the Solid Silver Hayman drum kit he used in the 1970s.

The show, starring the owarai duo Bakushō Mondai started out as a special presentation on October 15, 2005, and has been broadcast during prime- time on Fridays since April 7, 2006. Due to the extremely long title, the show is usually referred to as . The setup Hikari Ōta, who is a comedian, usually takes the position of Prime Minister, and puts forth to the assembled guests a manifesto, generally of a very radical, sometimes even ridiculous nature. In the video introduction that follows, Ōta's manifesto is explained, and a brief (and humorous) proof is given for how this particular manifesto will bring peace to Japan, and/or the world. The guests are then divided into those who propose and oppose the manifesto, and debating starts with an introduction by the \\"Prime Minister\\". The discussions, though generally civil, can often produce high tensions between debaters, even those arguing on the same side, and Speaker Fumi Mori (who is actually an announcer for Nippon TV), sitting above the assembly, often exercises her power to halt discussion and gives individuals a chance to speak freely. Hikari Ōta's partner in comedy Yūji Tanaka, acting secretary, doesn't participate in discussions and instead spends the entire show in the \\"Prime Minister's office\\" with Eriko Kumazawa (acting second secretary, though she is a model) eating foods given as gifts from the other guests and generally laughing whenever the debating gets hot. There is also a bench for \\"neutral\\" participants in the discussion, but guests who choose not to take sides are not often given a chance to speak. At the end of the debate (always announced by the Speaker, usually before any form of consensus is made) guests must give their final decision (to approve or reject the manifesto) to the Speaker. Manifestos that are approved by the assembly are proposed to the National Diet of Japan. The \\"manifestos\\" With Ōta (and occasionally a guest) as Prime Minister, the subject matter of the show varies widely from that of typical Japanese political debate shows. Whether Ōta actually believes what he proposes or not is debatable (he is known to take the opposing side of an argument for the sake of arguing), many of his manifestos are quite extreme, and the majority of his manifestos are not approved by the assembly. That being said, many of his manifestos deal with extremely important and difficult national and international issues, and though the tone of the show may be light with jokes and taunts being thrown around without consequence, the discussions are often very serious, and tears and lost tempers are not rare. A few notable manifestos that have been approved (and thus sent to the Diet) are: * Remove all support for NEET individuals (PM: Ōta) * Make a statement in the constitution stating that psychic phenomena do not exist (PM: Ōta) * Remove the salary of members of the official opposing political party (PM: Ōta) * Make the days of Japan's World Cup matches into national holidays (PM: Various) * Require doctors to take a license renewal test every 5 years (PM: Etsuko Namikawa, actress) A few notable manifestos that have been rejected are: * Write history textbooks in cooperation with other east Asian countries, as done in France and Germany (PM: Ōta) * Privatize the government of prefectures and cities (PM: Ōta) * Charge ¥100 for each character of input on the internet (PM: Ōta) * In the future, refuse to give any money to the US government (PM: Ōta) * Force homeowners to open their curtains during the afternoon (PM: Tōru Hashimoto, Lawyer - later became Osaka city mayor) The guests Ōta is known for his strong debating skills, and so as not to be strong-armed, a unique assembly of well-known guests from various walks of life are featured as regulars on the show. About a third of the guests are usually members (occasionally leaders) of major Japanese political parties, and the rest are usually a mix of famous tarento and prominent foreign personalities. While some of the regulars and guests are also strong debators, many (especially some of the tarento) do not tend to participate much in the heated talks. Quieter participants may be given a minute to speak their opinion in between major points of a discussion, and their straight opinions often help to keep the discussions focused. The show's regulars are: * Katsuei Hirasawa (平沢勝栄), LDP member * Hideaki Ōmura (大村秀章), LDP member * Akira Amari (甘利明), LDP member * Kazuhiro Haraguchi (原口一博), DPJ member, often supports Ōta * Yoshizumi Ishihara (石原良純), actor, tarento, and weatherman * Lasa-R Ishii (ラサール石井), comedian and actor * Kevin Clone, American-born Japanese international columnist, usually opposes Ōta and has an extremely strong debating style * Saya Kazuki (和希沙也), idol * George Takahashi (高橋ジョージ), rock vocalist, often supports Ōta * Hirotada Ototake (乙武洋匡), sports writer * Akiko Matsumoto (松本明子), tarento and actress * Kazuyo Matsui (松居一代), tarento, actress, and essayist * Pa-kkun Ma-kkun (パックンマックン), Japanese and American comedy duo In total, the show usually features more than 30 guests. The narrator of the show is Kiyoshi Kobayashi (小林清志). Reaction Though political discussion is not rare on Japanese television, direct political satire is almost non-existent, and Ōta himself has expressed worries about the future of the show in an interview with New York Times editor Norimitsu Onishi, Ōta reportedly will not touch upon certain topics, namely the imperial family and North Korea, because of the complex nature of the issues and a general lack of public understanding. Regardless, Ōta doesn't appear to be backing down as he says, References External links * Official Japanese homepage (flash) Japanese variety television shows Nippon TV original programming 2006 Japanese television series debuts Debate television series ","title":"Hikari Ota's If I Were Prime Minister...

He was the Archbishop of Cape Town, South Africa from 1957 to 1963 and was known as the \\"scourge of apartheid\\" for his ardent opposition to the whites-only policies of the South African government.  Education  De Blank was born in Rotterdam, Netherlands, on 14 November 1908, he became a British subject as a child in 1921. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, King's College London, and Queens' College, Cambridge.  Clerical career  He was ordained after a period of study at Ridley Hall, Cambridge in 1932 and began his career as a Curate in Bath. De Blank held incumbencies at Forest Gate and Greenhill, Harrow. During World War II he was an army chaplain. In 1952 he was appointed the Bishop of Stepney in the Diocese of London and continued in this post until he was translated to Cape Town. During this bishopric, de Blank, visited Ruth Ellis in prison just before she was hanged, for the murder of David Blakeley in 1955, when she told him, \\"It is quite clear to me that I was not the person who shot him. When I saw myself with the revolver I knew I was another person.\\" These comments were quoted in a London evening paper of the time, The Star.  South Africa  He succeeded Geoffrey Clayton as Archbishop of Cape Town in 1957. In South Africa, he refused to preach in any church not open to blacks as well as whites. He opposed clause 29 of Natives Law Amendment Bill, which gave the civil authorities powers to exclude non-whites from Anglican churches. In 1960 De Blank called on the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK) to repudiate apartheid, and in the same year criticised the South African jubilee celebrations: \\"This is no time for rejoicing, but for shame\\". De Blank suffered a stroke which caused him to resign from Cape Town in 1963. He returned to Britain whereupon he was appointed a residentiary canon of Westminster Abbey.  Honours and awards  * Appointed a sub-prelate of the Venerable Order of Saint John in 1952. * Appointed canon of Westminster Abbey in 1964.

Nothing much is known Gangadhar's life other than through the Shri GuruCharitra. Guru-Charitra means \\"Guru's Life Story\\" or \\"Guru's Biography\\". Family background Shri Gurucharitra indicates that Gangadhar belonged to the Deshastha Brahmin family of Apastambha sutra and that his gotra was Kaudinya. It is not known how many children he had but he frequently mentioned his \\"poorvaj\\", called Sayamdev. who was one of the four close disciples of Narasimha Saraswati. Gangadhar tells of the four generations of his family that preceded him. Poetic work Gangadhar was a skilled poet. Although his mother tongue was Kannada, the Shri Gurucharitra displays a mastery of the Marathi language. It is considered a \\"Ved\\" of Datta-Sampradaya, which is quite widespread in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. This Grantha is somewhat like Gita for Datta-Sampradaya adherents. Gangadhar wrote 52 chapters in which he describes the life and philosophy of Shripad ShriVallabha and Narasimha Saraswati. These are two avatars of Dattatreya. In spite of descriptions of Vedanta and other heady philosophical ideas, the Grantha is written with clarity. It is quite possible (according to experts such as R. C. Dhere) that he had the Sanskrit version of the Gurucharitra written by Narasimha Saraswati's disciple, Siddha, and he may have translated that into Prakrit language, i.e. Marathi. Life story Little is known about Gangadhar's life and death. But it appears that he was born after Narasimha Saraswati, possibly living between 1378 - 1458. It is also not possible that he may have had contact with one of the disciples, such as Siddha. However, he may have had access to a Sanskrit Gurucharitr written by Siddha, although there is no extant copy of this original Sanskrit work. Later, in the 19th-20th century, Vasudevanand Saraswati, alias Tembe Swami, (1854-1914) wrote a Sanskrit version of Shri GuruCharitra. He lived in the village of Kadaganchi, now located in Karnataka.
