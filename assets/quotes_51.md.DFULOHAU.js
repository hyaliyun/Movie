She later attended Life Chiropractic College, now Life University, and earned a doctor of chiropractic degree.  Career  Sands had a brief career in acting in the 1980s, appearing in several episodes of the television series The Bold and the Beautiful in 1987 and appeared in two movies in 1988 and 1989, including Deathstalker and the Warriors from Hell. Sands worked as a chiropractor in private practice from 1990 to 1999. In 1999 Sands married real estate mogul Fred Sands. Following his death in 2015, she succeeded him as the chair and CEO of Vintage Capital Group, which has around $150 million in assets, and of Vintage Real Estate. Political involvement She is also a Republican fundraiser and donor; she supported the 2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump. In 2016, Sands donated nearly a quarter-million dollars and organized high-dollar fundraisers for Trump's campaign, and subsequently gave $100,000 to Trump's inaugural committee. Sands was previously an economic advisor to Trump; she was one of eight woman that Trump added to his economic advisory council after facing criticism for initially naming an all-male slate. Sands was also a California delegate for the 33rd congressional district to the 2016 Republican National Convention. U.S. Ambassador to Denmark  Sands in a meeting in 2020 with U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, discussing ties between Alaska and Greenland. Trump nominated Sands to the post of U.S. Ambassador to the Kingdom of Denmark. The convicted fundraiser Elliott Broidy had put her name forth to Trump. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on November 2, 2017, on a voice vote. She formally assumed the office on December 15, 2017. In December 2019, she caused controversy by vetoing the presence of Stanley Sloan, a scholar of the NATO alliance, at a Danish Atlantic Council conference that was meant to celebrate the 70th anniversary of NATO and discuss its future. Sloan had been invited by the head of the Council, Lars Struwe, to give the keynote address at the conference. Days before the conference, Sands objected to Sloan speaking because he had criticized Trump; after Sands' intervention, the Danish Atlantic Council canceled the conference rather than accede to Sands' wishes. Struwe wrote to Sloan that \\"we believe that freedom of speech is paramount in every democracy\\" and that the think tank saw no conflict between Sloan's criticism of Trump and his participation as a speaker at a conference. The U.S. Embassy posted a Twitter message saying that the \\"proposed last-minute inclusion\\" of Sloan into the conference did not comply with the \\"agreement that we followed when recruiting all other speakers.\\" The Embassy offered no proof of that allegation, however, and Struwe denied that such a process had even existed. When all the other speakers for the conference were being selected, Struwe said the U.S. Embassy had played no role in choosing them or in confirming whether they would attend the conference.  Additional affiliations  Sands served on the boards of Pepperdine University, the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Arts, the Library Foundation of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. She was also named by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to be on the board of the California Cultural and Historical Endowment. Sands served as the President and Chairman of Blue Ribbon, an organization that supports the Los Angeles Music Center and also as a Director of the Performing Arts Center of Los Angeles County. Personal life Sands has one child, a daughter named Alexandra.

Family and education Daisy Frances Christina Osborn was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, the only child of Emily Jane Turvey, an Englishwoman, and Alfred Patterson Osborn, an Australian engraver. She attended Christchurch Girls‚Äô High School and studied art at Canterbury College School of Art intermittently over fifteen years (1906‚Äì11, 1913, 1919‚Äì21). She won a scholarship and numerous prizes at the school and began to exhibit in 1913. Johnson went on to teach part-time at the Canterbury College School of Art (1921‚Äì27), giving instruction in painting, metalwork, design, and embroidery. Art career Osborn worked as an illustrator of children's literature, mainly in pen and watercolour, and she designed modernist jewelry in silver with enamel or cloisonn√© decoration. However, she is now best known as a painter of portraits, Christchurch cityscapes, still lifes, and floral studies. There is also a group of religious paintings with pacifist themes from the 1930s, influenced in part by her interest in Theosophy. The sentimentality of her illustration work stands in stark contrast to the crisp contours and bold coloring of her mature paintings, such her 1936 portrait of fellow artist Rose Zeller. She continued to paint and exhibit until the year before she died, showing regularly at the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts and in the 1940 National Centennial Exhibition of New Zealand Art in Wellington. Her work is in many private collections, and some of her work is held by the Christchurch Art Gallery. She was included in the 1993 exhibition White Camellias: A Century of Art Making by Canterbury Women.

Description Vigna vexillata is a strong twiner with fusiform, tuberous roots. Its stems are usually clothed with brownish silky hairs, or trichomes.. Its leaflets come in three, which are oval-shaped and pointed at the tip, with the terminal leaflet being long. The leaflets are all a dark green and with appressed trichomes on both surfaces. The flowers are pink or purplish to yellow and long, on two- to four-flowered peduncles long, with the keel prolonged into an uncurved beak. The flowers are sweetly scented. The pod is recurved, linear, long, and silky. The stems tend to scramble over the ground and twine into the surrounding vegetation. It has good seedling vigor and good wet-season growth, and is effective in weed suppression. The seed shatters and it is not a good standover feed for the dry season. It is susceptible to both frost and fire. Although hairy, the plant is quite palatable. Habitat and Ecology Vigna vexillata thrives in a wide range of conditions, mostly in grasslands and in disturbed areas, as well as a weed. In India, the plant flourishes from in altitude in the foothills of the Himalayas and in the hills of eastern and north-eastern India. In Australia, it grows in the north where monsoons with of rainfall and a long dry season are common, growing on acidic soils rich in aluminum. Uses The plant is a very important food crop in several areas, such as Namibia, where it is commonly harvested from the wild for local use. Its use has spread beyond its native range and the plant is now sometimes cultivated for its edible tubers. It is also grown as a green manure and ground cover crop, especially in poor soils. The root is consumed raw or cooked. The tubers have a soft, easily peeled skin and creamy flesh. They are boiled or roasted and are particularly rich in protein. The young leaves, young pods, and seeds are also cooked and eaten as a vegetable.

Telling the time through this system works by dividing it in fractions of a quarter and half a quarter of an hour. Hour-fractions refer to the starting hour, taking into account that when a clock reaches a whole hour (e.g. three o'clock) it actually indicates its end. Catalan-system watch telling the time The order is quarts-minuts-hora posterior (quarters-minutes-next hour). Hence, for example, 10:15 h would be un quart d'onze (\\"a quarter of eleven\\"); 12:30 h, dos quarts d'una (\\"two quarters of one\\"), and 19:52 h would be tres quarts i set minuts de vuit (\\"three quarters and seven minutes of eight\\"). Additionally, there are little variations by which the expression dos quarts (\\"two quarters\\") is shortened to just quarts (\\"quarters\\"); also, mig quart (\\"half a quarter\\") is used as an approximation in place of the too specific set minuts i mig (\\"seven minutes and a half\\").  Notation examples  Cardedeu's town council has a Catalan- system clock on its fa√ßade, telling the time in quarters. * \\"Quarters\\" (quarts) examples: : 01:15 un quart de dues (\\"a quarter of two\\") : 01:30 dos quarts de dues (\\"two quarters of two\\") : 01:45 tres quarts de dues (\\"three quarters of two\\") * Whenever it's clear that you are referring specifically to the time (for example, when someone's asking it), you can give the time by leaving out the quarts (\\"quarters\\"), thus shortening the notation as follows: : 07:45 tres de vuit (\\"three [quarters] of eight\\") : 16:30 dos de cinc (\\"two [quarters] of five\\") * \\"Half a quarter\\" (mig quart) examples: : 02:07:30 mig quart de tres (half a quarter of three) : 02:22:30 un quart i mig de tres (a quarter and a half of three) : 02:37:30 dos quarts i mig de tres (two quarters and a half of three) : 02:52:30 tres quarts i mig de tres (three quarters and a half of three) : The Catalan time system is restricted to 12-hour clocks; if necessary, one can specify if it's an hour of the morning (matinada or mat√≠), noon (migdia), afternoon (tarda or vesprada), evening (vespre) or night (nit).

Early life Oreste Francesco Pucciani was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 7, 1916. He attended public schools in Cleveland and graduated from Adelbert College, Western Reserve University (later Case Western Reserve University) in 1939. He was part of the Phi Beta Kappa. He then completed his education with a doctorate in Romance languages from Harvard University in 1943. His doctoral dissertation analyzed Walt Whitman's reception in France. From 1946 to 1947, Pucciani obtained a Sheldon Traveling Fellowship and studied in France and Italy. He met Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. Career In 1947 Oreste Pucciani returned to the United States and at first lectured at Harvard, and in 1948 he joined University of California, Los Angeles, at first as Assistant Professor of French. In 1954 he became Associate Professor and in 1960 he was named full Professor. From 1961 to 1966 he was chairman of the French department, and became professor emeritus in 1979. In 1954 he published The French Theater since 1930, a still used anthology of French theater between World War I and World War II. In 1961 he published a translation of Jean Racine's Ph√©dre: Pucciani was a pioneer teacher on Jean-Paul Sartre's philosophy at UCLA even before Sartre was translated into English. Pucciani studied with Emile B. De Sauz√© at Adelbert College, and was a supporter of Sauz√©'s \\"direct method\\" of language teaching, which he introduced in the late 1950s to the UCLA French Department's language program: he banned the use of English from his classrooms; although today this is common practice, at the time was a revolutionary method in the United States, where foreign languages were taught using English translations and learning by memory already built sentences. In 1967 Pucciani together with Jacqueline Hamel published Langue et Langage, a textbook describing the experience of the UCLA French Department with the direct method. In 1965 Pucciani was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Legion of Honour by the French government for his services to French language and culture.

It is one of the busiest motorway interchanges in the UK. It is situated directly on the edge of Buckinghamshire, Greater London (London Borough of Hillingdon) and Berkshire. It is also not too far from Surrey and Staines-upon-Thames. History The M4 (London-South Wales Motorway) under the interchange was opened in December 1964, from junctions 4 (A408) to 5; this 3.9-mile section cost ¬£3.2m, and was built by Cubitts and Green. The interchange, hence, is junction 4b of the M4. The interchange is around one mile north-west of Heathrow Airport; the interchange is the main junction for traffic heading from the M25 to the airport. The interchange is the point that the M4 enters Greater London. Design The bridge decks were to be built of prestressed concrete, but instead were built with composite steel beams and concrete decks, designed to BS 5400. In the early 1980s, when the interchange was being built, the entire M25 was to cost around ¬£600m. The southern part of the M4/M25 interchange was part of a 2.05-mile section of the M25 which was due to open in spring 1985, the Poyle to Thorney Mill Road section, from junction 14 (Poyle Interchange) to junction 15. The ¬£44m contract, given to the joint venture of Cementation/Costain, was to take three years.Contract The M25 section was due to be open nine months before the M4/M25 interchange would open.Opening The northern section of the interchange was to be part of a 10.5-mile section of the M25 also due to open in spring 1985; this later became the 4-mile M4 to Iver Heath section to the M40, at Denham Interchange junction 16. The 6.5-mile section of the M25 directly north of the M40 opened in January 1985. Much of the M25 was designed by Halcrow Group. The interchange was designed by Atkins. Looking north along the M25 in April 2009 Construction 3.5m cubic metres of infill was needed for the contoured landscaping. The section of M25 to the north began construction in April 1983.Times, Tuesday 17 September 1985, page 21 Construction took 28 months, and cost ¬£25m, with ¬£10m for the fifteen bridges, by Wimpey Construction. The bridges were built to allow expansion to four lanes at a later date. The M25 was opened by Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale on Wednesday 18 September 1985, an 11-mile section directly south of the M40 to Poyle. The section had cost ¬£80m. The M4/M25 junction was planned to open at a later date of June 1986, but it opened six months early, due to good weather, on Thursday 19 December 1985. At the time of opening two sections of the M25 remained ‚Äì in Hertfordshire and Kent (which opened in February 1986), and the M4/M25 junction was expected to be the busiest motorway junction in the UK.Times, Tuesday 17 December 1985, page 3IHT Motorway Archive Looking westwards at the centre of the interchange along the M4 westwards, from the M25 north, in February 2007 Structure It is a typical stack interchange. The part of the interchange that is north of the M4 is in Iver, in South Bucks. It is named after Thorney, Buckinghamshire, now part of Iver, the village in which the northern part of the interchange in situated. The part of the interchange that is south of the M4 is in Colnbrook with Poyle, in Slough. West Drayton and Harmondsworth are close to the east. There are 11 bridges and three major viaducts, varying from 182m to 264m long. A 229m viaduct carries the M25 over the M4. A single-track disused railway line passes through the middle of the interchange. The railway line, the former Staines and West Drayton Railway, is still there.Railway line The railway line went from West Drayton railway station, to the north, to Staines West railway station, to the south, and the disused section passes through the Lakeside Road Industrial Estate to the south.

Golter (January 24, 1890 in Russia ‚Äì March 31, 1971 in California, USA) was born in Russia but emigrated to the United States in 1906. In 1926, he became superintendent of the Los Angeles Sanatorium, a free treatment center run by the Jewish Consumptive Relief Association in Duarte, California. In 1932, Golter became Executive Director. He led a nation-wide campaign to eliminate the institution's large debt, followed by a successful expansion. Under his leadership, the institution transitioned from a small tuberculosis treatment center to a major research, teaching, and treatment center for cancer and other diseases, with a $600,000 annual budget. Long nicknamed \\"The City of Hope\\", the expanded institution was officially renamed the City of Hope National Medical Center. Early life Samuel Harry Golter was born in Russia on January 24, 1890 and emigrated to America in 1906, at the age of 16. In Chicago, he was able to stay with a family who he knew from Russia. He found work at a picture frame factory, and became sympathetic to the socialist movement because of the harassing methods used by some employers. During evenings and weekends, Golter studied to improve his education. He became the superintendent for the clothing manufacturer Hart, Schaffner and Marx in Chicago. During World War I, Golter enlisted in the army. In 1920, Golter traveled to Eastern Europe as part of a relief mission, spending 2 years working with victims of the First World War.  Jewish Consumptive Relief Association  \\"In the beginning, two tents\\" While visiting California Golter was invited by the Jewish Consumptive Relief Association, to visit the Los Angeles Sanatorium, a small tuberculosis sanatorium near Los Angeles which treated patients for free. The Jewish Consumptive Relief Association (JCRA), which ran the sanatorium, originated in 1912 and was incorporated in the State of California in May, 1913. In 1914, after the City of Los Angeles required all consumption facilities to be located outside the city limits, the JCRA bought ten acres of land in Duarte, California, and established the Los Angeles Sanatorium there. It initially consisted of two tents. These were later replaced by frame cottages. In 1926, Golter became the sanatorium superintendent. In 1932, faced with the Great Depression and a large institutional debt, Golter took on the job of Executive Director with the goal of revitalizing the sanatorium. Golter developed a grassroots \\"People's Movement\\" to raise funds from across the United States. Travelling nation- wide, he focused on three constituencies and encouraged them to form groups in support of the sanatorium: upper class women (\\"Auxiliaries\\"), young people (\\"Juniors\\"), and trade unions. He was able not only to save the institution, but to expand it during the 1930s and 1940s. It was nicknamed \\"The City of Hope\\". The City of Hope \\"The City of Hope\\", postcard, between 1930 and 1945 By the end of World War II, tuberculosis vaccines were beginning to significantly decrease the prevalence of tuberculosis, and the need for sanatoriums was lessening. In 1946, Golter proposed that the sanatorium become a comprehensive medical center. The board and delegates to the JCRA's biennial convention approved a campaign to build a new medical building and facilities for the treatment of diseases such as cancer in addition to tuberculosis. Golter partnered with the UCLA Medical School to create the new Medical Research Institute, the City of Hope National Medical Center. By 1952, the new center included facilities for research, and by 1953 it was accepting graduate students in the biological sciences. When Golter retired in 1953, the center had an annual budget of $600,000. The humanitarian principles underlying the sanatorium were deeply important to Golter, who worked to ensure that it was a democratic, non-sectarian institution. It was important to respect the dignity of the patients who received free care, rather than viewing them as \\"charity\\" cases. He wrote a credo for the City of Hope base on \\"three pillars\\" of \\"service, humanitarianism, and reward\\", and developed \\"Thirteen Articles of Faith\\" based on the pillars, outlining a program for the institution. His motto, \\"There is no profit in curing the body, if in the process, we destroy the soul\\", appears on the Golter Gate in the International Garden of Meditation (the Rose Garden) at City of Hope, emphasizing this patient- centered philosophy. Regarding the sanatorium, he stated: Golter's book, The City of Hope, published in 1954, combined information about his personal life and the institution, explicitly examining his experience of persecution as a Jew, and the ways in which he felt that influenced his ideals and achievements. Golter retired in 1953 and was succeeded by Ben Horowitz. Golter died on Wednesday, March 31, 1971, and was buried at Hillside Memorial Cemetery. He was survived by his wife Rose and daughter Irma Sandra (Mrs. Benjamin F. Breslauer, Jr.).

The film, produced by London Weekend Television's Joshua St. Johnston, focuses on security guard Richie Liddle (Ross Kemp), who foils an armed robbery and becomes a national hero, but finds his new-found fame cannot appease his guilty conscience. The film was the first project commissioned as part of a \\"Golden Handcuffs\\" deal for Kemp, following his departure from EastEnders and the BBC for ITV. The film pulled in 11.7 million viewers on its debut broadcast, becoming one of the channel's highest rated new dramas of the year. The BBC later reported in 2002 that the film had been Kemp's most successful project for the channel, following a poor start for his action drama series Ultimate Force, which suffered badly in direct competition with Waking the Dead. An extended version of the film was released on VHS on 19 June 2000, containing footage not broadcast on television, as well an exclusive behind-the-scenes documentary; but has yet to be released on DVD. Production Filming for Hero of the Hour commenced in 1999, but was unexpectedly delayed when Kemp was shot in the face during a stunt that went wrong. Although treated at the scene by paramedics, Kemp required further hospital treatment. He suffered cuts to his chest and face after safety glass shattered, and was also hit in the face by the discharge from a blank round. Kemp went on to make a full recovery. Plot Security guard Richie Liddle (Ross Kemp) is an ordinary family man with four kids to support. Money is tight and tension is high as his wife Alison (Maggie O'Neill) constantly nags him to get a better job and move them away from their troubled estate. In addition, his eldest daughter Donna (Lara Bruce) suffers from bullying due to a facial disfigurement. There seems no way out, until one dark night an incident occurs that transforms him into both hero and villain. The building he is guarding is robbed, and whilst Richie is trying to chase off the burglars, he comes across a bag of stolen money.

Life Before arriving in the Pinacoteca collection it belonged to marchese Luigi Malaspina - it was recorded in his 1833 will as a work by Francesco Francia, a painter from Bologna. It was re-attributed to Correggio by Giovanni Morelli in 1880, with whom most later art historians have agreed. It was exhibited at the first major retrospective of Correggio's work in Parma in 1884. More recently, however, it has been suggested that it be re-attributed to the Orombelli Master, an anonymous Mantuan painter. David Ekserdjian has also expressed doubts about the work being by Correggio.http://www.correggioarthome.it/SchedaOpera.jsp?idDocumentoArchivio=2490 The painting seems to be too low quality to be by Correggio, unless it is a very early work by him. Comparison with definite Corregios from the 1520s, such as Madonna and Child with the Infant John the Baptist, also suggests it is not by him. However, its poor state of conservation makes a definite attribution difficult - Gustavo Frizzoni already complained in 1901 of inappropriate restorations and it was also damaged during restorations in 1914 by Luigi Cavenaghi and in 1948 by Mario Rossi.

The columella is provided with four cords, of which the fourth, which marks the anterior limit of the columella, is as strong as the first, while the two intermediate ones are less strongly developed. In addition to the spiral sculpture, the whorls are marked with rounded, low, quite regularly spaced, axial ribs, of which 10 occur upon the first and second, and 14 upon the body whorl . These ribs render the spiral cords tuberculated at their junction with them. In addition, to these strong axial ribs, the entire surface of the shell, between the sutures ami the anterior half of the base, is marked by numerous, quite regular, closely spaced, axial threads, which are best shown in the spaces between the spiral cords and on the tabulated summit of the whorls. The aperture is rather large, scarcely channeled posteriorly. The outer lip is very thick, rendered denticulate on the outside by the spiral cords. The inner lip and the parietal wall are glazed with a thin callus. Distribution This marine species occurs off Port Alfred, South Africa.

Catsup plays a significant role in zinc ion transmembrane transport, and the mutations in Catsup gene can lead to abnormal accumulation of membrane proteins, such as Notch, decreased Notch signalling, increase in levels of apoptosis, and induce of ER stress response. Additionally, Catsup plays an important role in regulation of dopamine synthesis, and the mutations in Catsup gene can lead to hyperactivity of Catsup-regulated enzymes TH, GTPCH, and VMAT, as well as to increases in dopamine (DA) and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) levels.  Gene structure and function  Catsup is a pleiotropic quantitative trait gene that encodes a negative regulator of dopamine (DA) and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis, as well as synaptic vesicle uptake in Drosophila melanogaster. In dopamine synthesis, Catsup functions to inhibit Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), GTP Cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), and Vesicular Monoamine Transporter (VMAT) enzyme activity. Various molecular polymorphisms of Catsup are associated with variations in quantitative traits, such as locomotor behavior, lifespan, and sensory bristle number. Catsup protein is composed of seven transmembrane helices that induce post-translational modification of both enzymes TH and GTPCH, and two conserved extracellular ZIP Zinc transporter domains that possess zinc ion transmembrane transport activity. Catsup co-localizes with enzymes TH and VMAT to dopaminergic neuron cell bodies and synaptic termini. Additionally, Catsup gene encodes Drosophila ortholog to ZIP7 zinc transporter protein, which is part of ZIP (Zrt/Irt-like protein) family in mammals.  Role in regulation of dopamine biosynthesis  Catsup regulates production of dopamine by serving as a negative regulator of rate-limiting enzymes in dopamine and pteridine synthesis pathways, both of which are required to occur for production of dopamine. In dopamine synthesis pathway, Catsup negatively regulates Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity, preventing TH catalyzed conversion of tyrosine to the precursor of dopamine, L-Dopa. In pteridine biosynthesis pathway, Catsup negatively regulates the activity of GTP Cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), preventing GTPCH catalyzed biosynthesis of TH cofactor required for TH catalytic activity and regulation, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4).  Role in zinc ion transmembrane transport  Catsup gene encodes Drosophila ortholog to ZIP7 zinc transporter protein in mammals, which controls zinc homeostasis and maintains concentrations of free zinc low in cells. Zinc transporters allow zinc transport into the cytoplasm of the cell, and disruptions to zinc transporters can lead to neurodevelopmental damages.  Mutations  As the zinc ion transmembrane transporter, Catsup mutations can lead to abnormal accumulation of membrane proteins, such as Notch, decreased Notch signalling, increase in levels of apoptosis, and induce of ER stress response. As the regulator of dopamine biosynthesis, Catsup mutations can lead to hyperactivity of Catsup-regulated enzymes TH, GTPCH, and VMAT, as well as to increases in dopamine (DA) and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) levels.

However, the mixed list of the National Union, essentially composed of Monarchists, won (M. de Belcastel, the last elected member of this list, passed with 63,123 votes). The newly formed Assembly, mostly monarchist and favorable to peace, invested on February 19, a new government headed by Adolphe Thiers. He was not more successful at the Legislative Elections of 21 August 1881; 4,229 ¬´ opportunistic¬ª votes (Moderate Republicans, center-left) were reported on his name in the second district of Toulouse, but the outgoing Radical-socialist (extreme-left) deputy and ex-Prefect of Haute-Garonne in 1870, Armand Duportal was reelected with 4,618 votes. Jean Jules Godefroy Cal√®s, however, was made Knight of the Legion of Honor (Chevalier de la L√©gion d'Honneur) on July 9, 1883.  At the French Parliament (1885-1889)  421x421pxJean Jules Godefroy Cal√®s was finally elected deputy of Haute-Garonne at the Legislative Elections of 4 October 1885. As general councilor of Villefranche since 1880, he was placed on the list of the Moderate Republicans and obtained 27,244 votes in the first round. Several Republicans of diverse horizons decided to concentrate their votes on his list for the second round, to stop the success of the Monarchists (who had already two elected candidates). Thus, Cal√®s passed as the penultimate of the list, on October 18, 1885, and was elected with 57,621 votes (out of 113,803 voters and 138,226 registered). Cal√®s sat within the parliamentary group of the Radical Left, and held, in his votes, an almost equal balance between the Moderate and Opportunists Republicans and the Radicals Republicans, both in the majority of this new chamber, due to their grouping, and this, despite the push of the Conservative Union of the Monarchists and Bonapartists. Cal√®s thus sat during 4 years, during the IVth legislature which took place from November 10, 1885 to November 11, 1889, under the presidency of the Republic of Jules Gr√©vy (until December 2, 1887) and then of Sadi Carnot. Cal√®s neither supported the Freycinet government (1886) nor the Goblet government (1886-87), both composed of broad parliamentary coalitions and including General Boulanger at the War Ministry. The General Georges Ernest Boulanger was an extremely popular politician, promoter of an aggressive nationalism (known as revanchism) against Germany (he was nicknamed ¬´ G√©n√©ral Revanche ¬ª), and powerful enough to establish himself as dictator at the zenith of his popularity in January 1889, obliging the Republican camp to reorganize and strengthen its solidarity in opposition to him. After having shaken the Third Republic, the General was finally condemned, fled France, and committed suicide in Belgium in 1891.Jean- Marie Mayeur and Madeleine Reb√©rioux: ¬´ The Third Republic from its Origins to the Great War, 1871-1914 ¬ª (1984), p. 136 Cal√®s supported however the Rouvier government (1887), in which General Boulanger was dismissed, the Tirard government (1887-88), composed by the President of the Republic Sadi Carnot, newly elected by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies on 2 December 1887, the government Floquet (1888-89) and the second government Tirard (1889-90), all governments with a Republican opportunist majority. Established during the Boulanger affair, this prestigious cabinet, in which four former presidents of the Council were seating (Falli√®res, de Freycinet, Rouvier and Tirard), was also supported by Radical Republicans to counter the Boulangist movement. In this last parliamentary session, Cal√®s abstained on the re-establishment of the uni-nominal ballot (law of 13 February 1889), voted against the indefinite postponement of Constitutional revision, in favor of the Lisbon bill restrictive on the freedom of the press, and for the prosecution of three deputies who were members the far-right Ligue des Patriotes which was dissolved on April 3, 1889. In particular, he voted on April 4, 1889 in favor of the prosecution of General Boulanger ¬´ for conspiracy and treasonable activity ¬ª, thus marking the twilight of Boulangism. At the end of his mandate, Cal√®s did not postulate for a second one (Legislative Elections of 22 September 1889). Like his father Godefroy Cal√®s (1799-1868), Jean-Jules had a close friendship relation with the writer, philosopher, poet, historian, professor at the Coll√®ge de France and republican politician Edgar Quinet (1803-1875) and his second wife, Hermiona Asachi (1821-1900).

History  The history of the French language in Minnesota is closely linked with that of Canadian settlers, such as explorer Louis Hennepin and trapper Pierre Parrant, who contributed very early on to its use in the area. As early as the mid-17th century, evidence shows the presence of French expeditions, settlements and villages in the region, in particular thanks to Frenchmen Pierre-Esprit Radisson and M√©dard des Groseilliers, who likely reached Minnesota in 1654 after exploring Wisconsin.2004 : Minnesota French Facts () Pierre \\"Pig's Eye\\" Parrant, first settler in Saint Paul, Minnesota A few years later, explorer Cavelier de la Salle charted the Mississippi, ending his voyage in the neighboring state of North Dakota. He gave this region the nickname of \\"L'√©toile du Nord\\" (Star of the North), which eventually became the motto of the State of Minnesota.State Names, Seals, Flags, and Symbols: A Historical Guide, third edition ‚Äì Barbara S. Shearer and Benjamin F. Shearer, Greenwood Press, 2002 Great Seal of the State of Minnesota The exploration of the northern territories and areas surrounding the Great Lake, including Minnesota, was encouraged by Frontenac, the Governor of New France.https://www.aqaf.eu/2017/03/letoile-du-nord-du-gouverneur-frontenac/ In the early days of Minnesota's settlement, many of its early European inhabitants were of Canadian origin, including Pierre Parrant, a trapper and fur trader born in Sault Ste. Marie (Michigan) in 1777. The Red River M√©tis community also played an important part in the use of French in Minnesota. Since 1858, when the State of Minnesota was established, the Great Seal of the State of Minnesota bears Cavelier de la Salle's French motto \\"L'√©toile du Nord\\".  Arts  A number of architectural, pictorial and musical works in Minnesota were and are still made by French-speaking residents or visitors. For example, the St. Louis Parish was established in 1868 by French architect Emmanuel Louis MasquerayMinnesota, R. Conrad Stein, 1990  Famous francophones in Minnesota  Irma LeVasseur, the first French-Canadian woman to become a doctor, was trained in French in Minnesota before she went on to practice in Qu√©bec and Europe. She studied medicine at the University of Saint Paul, Minnesota, as Qu√©bec universities did not allow women to attend. She practiced in the United States from 1900 to 1903 until she was authorized to do so in her home country. In 1907, with the help of Justine Lacoste-Beaubien and other doctors she recruited, including S√©verin Lachapelle, LeVasseur founded the h√¥pital Sainte-Justine in Montr√©al. French architect Emmanuel Louis Masqueray settled in Minnesota in 1905 and stayed until his death. He designed many mansions and houses throughout Minnesota and about two dozen parish churches for Catholic and Protestant congregations in the upper Midwest, including: * Cathedral of Saint Paul (Cath√©drale Saint Paul), St. Paul (1904) * Basilica of Saint Mary (Basilique Sainte Marie), Minneapolis (1908) * Incarnation Catholic Church (√©glise de l'Incarnation), Minneapolis (1909) * St. Paul's Episcopal Church on the Hill, St. Paul (1912) * Bethlehem Lutheran Church, 655 Forest Street, St. PaulSt. Paul's Architecture, by Jeffrey A.

Among the students who trained there, the best known certainly is Edwin Lundie (1886‚Äì1972).\\"The Architecture of Edwin H. Lundie\\", by Dale Muflinger Other architects associated with Masqueray in St. Paul were Fred Slifer and Frank Abrahamson.  In the 20th century  The use of French in Minnesota plummeted after American States launched campaigns to anglicize their population throughout the 20th century. During a certain period, teaching and speaking French in schools was forbidden. According to the 1980 United States Census, only 303 599 \\"persons of French origin\\", 10,026 \\"other French speakers\\" and 775 people \\"born in France\\" remained in Minnesota, which represents about 8.2% of the total state population.Monnier, 1987 : Franco- Am√©ricains et francophones aux Etats-Unis p. 533 ()  Places  The town of Gentilly was of great importance for French-Canadian immigration in Minnesota. Its Catholic church, dedicated to St. Peter, is now listed as a historical building. Unlike most churches in the area, which are made of wood, this church was built with bricks. It was erected in 1914 as the \\"church of the French\\" for the region, most of which were immigrants from Joliette, Quebec, in the late 19th century. Inside the church, the stations of the Way of the Cross and the stained glass pictures bear French-only inscriptions.Pierre Verri√®re, 2017 : Franco-Am√©ricains et francophones aux Etats-Unis () The communities of Terrebonne, Huot, Roseau and St. Hilaire are also places of historical significance for French-Canadian immigration. Throughout Minnesota and the surrounding states, numerous place names still bear names of French origins, including: Mille Lacs County, French River, French Lake, Roseau County, St. Louis County, Lac qui Parle County, Hennepin County, Le Sueur County, Lyon County, Voyageurs National Park, Lake Vermilion, Grand Portage, Lake Marquette, Fond du Lac River, Bois Blanc Lake, Lac Vieux Desert lake, Lac Pl√® (or Pel√©) lake, Belle Plaine, Belle Taine, Belle Rose Island, La Croix Lake, La Salle Lake, La Salle River, LaBelle Lake, Le Homme Dieu Lake, Nord lake, La Grand, La Crosse, Audubon, Bain, Beauford, Beaulieu, Bejou, Bellaire, Belgian Township, Belle Prairie Township, Bellevue Township, Duluth, Dumont, Duquette, Frenchy Corner, Frontenac, Grand Marais, Lafayette, La Fontaine, La Cressent, Lagarde, Le Roy, Le Center, Marcoux, St. Hilaire, Chapeau Lake, Faribault, Lake of the Woods (lac des Bois), Nicollet County, etc.  Today  In present-day Minnesota, French is maintained alive through bilingual education options and French-language classes in universities and schools. It is also promoted by local associations and groups such as AFRAN (Association des Fran√ßais du Nord), who support events such as the Chautauqua Festival in Huot, an event celebrating the French heritage of local communities. In 2012, a Franco-f√™te Festival was held in Minneapolis. Similar events take place every year throughout the state of Minnesota.http://fahfminn.org/events/ Since Minnesota shares a border with French-speaking areas of Canada, French exchanges remain common. In 2004, an estimated 35% of Minnesota's production was being exported to Francophone countries (Canada, France, Belgium and Switzerland).

At the beginning of its work, the gallery focused on presenting the Proven√ßal painters artworks, first of all a group of artists led by √âmile Loubon (1809-1863), later called The School of Marseille:L√©on Lagrange, Exposition de Marseille, Gazette des Beaux- Arts, November 1, 1859, p.186. Auguste Auguier (1814-1865), Paul Guigou (1834-1871), Prosper Gr√©sy (1801‚Äì1874), Adolphe Monticelli (1824-1886). Along with the modern Provan√ßal painters, the gallery exposed the works of the Barbizon school artists (Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot (1796-1875), Eug√®ne Boudin (1824-1898), Gustave Caillebotte (1848-1894)), as well as the masters of previous epochs, such as Michelangelo (1475-1564), Caravaggio (1571-1610), Murillo (1617-1682), and Jean-Honor√© Fragonard (1732-1806). After Eug√®ne Lambert retired in 1923, his follower Alexandre Jouv√®ne became the art gallery manager. In 1923 the gallery was officially named Jouv√®ne. Among other great names exhibited in the gallery during the period of 1923 - 1946, were Paul C√©zanne (1839-1906), Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890), Renoir (1841-1919) F√©lix Ziem (1821-1911), Jean-Baptiste Olive (1848-1936), Fran√ßois-Marius Granet (1775-1849), Th√©odore Rousseau (1812-1867), James Barry (1741-1806), Joseph Suchet (1824-1896), Joseph Garibaldi (1863-1941), Louis-L√©opold Boilly (1761-1845), Jean Roque (1880-1925), Louis Gustav Ricard (1823-1873), Joseph Vernet (1714-1789), Joseph Boze (1746-1826), Vincent Courdouan (1810-1893), and Pierre Puget (1620-1694). After 1946, with new managers, the Jouv√®ne gallery continued the tradition of presenting the Proven√ßal painters artworks. The gallery worked closely with the contemporary expressionists, such as: Georges Briata (1933-), Yvette Bont√© (1925-), Raymond Garnier, Fran√ßois Guy (1940-), Jean-Paul Courchia (1955-).Jean-Max Tixier, Preface to the book of Alauzen Di Genova, Maitres Proven√ßaux: de 1859 √† nos jours.

The holes for the cross-bars can be seen in the sides. The Bhutesvara Yakshis, also called the Bhutesar Yakshis are a series of yakshi reliefs on a railing, dating to the 2nd century CE during the time of the Kushan Empire.History and the Present, Partha Chatterjee, Anjan Ghosh Anthem Press, 2006 pp7 The reliefs were found in the Bhutesar mound, around the remains of a Buddhist stupa, outside Mathura, and are now located in the Indian Museum in Kolkata,The Culture of India, Kuiper, Kathleen, Britannica Educational Publishing, 2010 p.209 with three pillars, and three more pillars and one fragment (half of a pillar) in the Mathura Museum. They are an important example of Mathura art, of which these and other yakshi figures are \\"perhaps the best known examples\\".Harle, 60 The backs of the pillars contain reliefs with scenes from the life of the Buddha, and from Jataka tales about his previous lives. The Bhutesar mound is one of a row of large mounds originally just outside the city of Mathura, but now well within the modern city. The important, mostly Jain, site of Kankali Tila was two mounds down.Archaeological Survey Of India, Vol XVII, Alexander Cunningham, p.110-111 Front of the pillars The pillars are four feet four inches tall and eleven inches wide,Growse, 121 the figures therefore well under life-size. The Yakshis are seen standing on crouching figures of dwarves.Introducing Indian Art - R & K Publishing House, 1963, J. P. Guha, Page 121 Above the yakshis is a ledge, above which are a pair of figures shown from chest height up. These are couples of a male and a bare- breasted female, interacting in a variety of ways. A lintel carved with ornament runs above; this is a different piece of stone, which has been put back in place in the display in Kolkata. The sides of the pillars have slots for holding horizontal members, the whole making up a section of the type of railing usually found around stupas of this period, such as Sanchi or Amaravati Stupa.Rowland, 157-158 In the past the Kolkata display has included these.Craven, photo as fig. 66 This group of Yakshi figures is praised for the delicacy of their rendering, the absence of heaviness despite the plumpness of the figures, and their smiling and playful countenance. Compared to the earlier yakshis at Bharhut, Roy C. Craven finds these \\"more vivacious and Amazonian in nature, and their smooth, inflated volumptuousness gives them buoyancy and life. They seem about to spring from the backs of their supporting dwarfs ... [and] ... have the monumental frontality which is characteristic of Mathura sculpture\\".Craven, 107 Writing of these and other contemporary Mathura yakshi figures from railings, Benjamin Rowland finds: > a flamboyance and sensuality of expression surpassing anything known in the > art of earlier periods. In their provocative and frank display of the > beauties and delights of the courtesan's art, these reliefs mark the > culmination of a tendency already noted in the carvings at Sanchi and > Bharhut. Not only is there a thoroughly convincing suggestion of solidity of > form, but the articulation of body and limbs is achieved with complete > mastery... The question may well be asked: what is the purpose of such > frankly sensuous figures on a Buddhist monument? The answer is that possibly > they represent a pointed reference on the exterior of the sacred enclosure > to the transitory life of pleasure, outside the peace of the world of > Buddha; again, it may be that, like the mithunas of later Hindu art, they > represent an allegory of the desirability of the soul's union with the > divine in the forms of these beautiful dryads that so actively suggest the > desirability of sexual union.Rowland, 157-159 The Yashis have varied attitudes, variations on the tribhanga (three bend) pose that was to become extremely popular in Indian art.Rowland, 158 One of them is seen holding a bird cage. Another one looks at herself in a mirror while adjusting a piece of earring. Yet another serves wine to the couple above and holds a grape. The yakshi in the half-pillar in Mathura holds a huge sword; possibly this relates to the various literary references to female royal bodyguards or harem guards.Varadpande, 45-46 They are from the front completely naked apart from elaborate jewellery, but wear thin skirts, which most have gathered to one side, the hanging folds appearing on the flat background surface.Growse, 121 The couples above the yakshi are found in another Mathura set of railing pillars of similar date from Jaisinghpura, also in the Mathura Museum. Here only the heads appear.Rowland, 157, plate 101; Varadpande, plates 13, 14, 15 The dwarfish male figures the yakshis stand on seem rather cheerful, and instead of representing the usual evil figures stood on by Indian deities, may in this case represent yaksha lovers who have offended their mistress in some way; there are many literary references to men appeasing women by submitting in this way.Varadpande, Chapter 5, \\"At their Feet\\" They are also found in other Mathura yakshi pillars. History The memoirs of Sir F. S. Growse, the District collector of the Mathura district, and founder in 1874 of the Mathura Museum, relate that in his time five of the pillars were \\"built into the verandah of a chaupal close by\\" the site. One had already been removed to Calcutta (Kolkata) by Alexander Cunningham, and Growse sent two more, leaving three for the Mathura Museum \\"where possibly they may now have been placed\\".Growse, 120-121 File:KITLV 87973 - Unknown - Jaina pillars coming from Mathura in British India - 1897.tifFive of the pillars, in 1897.

Their ink has several purposes, most of which have a chemical basis. For one, the ink serves to cloud the predator's vision as well as halt their senses temporarily. In addition, the chemicals in the ink mimic food. Their skin and digestive tract are toxic to predators as well. They are also seen to change their feeding behaviours in response to averse stimuli.  Diet and impact on ink  The diet of sea hares enable them to gain the chemicals present in their ink and determine the color of their ink. They have adapted over time to feed mainly on seaweed and algae as without their specific diet they will be left without ink and fall prey to predators. The species they feed on determine the strength of their chemical defense. Individuals that feed on red algae, such as plocamium, were found to have better defense than those that fed on green algae, like ulva lactuca.  Chemical component  The ink and opaline glands produce ink and opaline respectively; these two substances are mixed in the cavity and expelled towards the predator. The ink and opaline are highly concentrated with free amino acids and ammonium; they are responsible for the response of the predators since predators have receptive sites for them. The ink and opaline has been demonstrated to stimulate appetitive and ingestive behaviours, though opaline differs in the sense in that it inhibits ingestion.  The effect on predators   Phagomimicry  Phagomimicry is the defensive behaviour in which expelled chemicals mimic food, deceiving some organisms to eat it instead. In the case of sea hares, the ink produced deceives their predators to attack their ink instead of pursuing the sea hare. This is possible because of the chemicals present in sea hares' ink mixture. The ink and opaline contains high levels of amino acids and ammonium, present in their predators' food. As a result, predators are deceived into attacking the mixture and feeding on it. This gives the sea hare an opportunity to escape. This reaction has been observed in some lobsters.  Sensory disruption  The chemicals produced also affect the nervous system of the predators. The ink produces an averse response in some predators. For instance, sea anemones shrivel up when they come in contact with the Ink.

In the 1950s, she founded with her husband, David Zeiger, and her parents, David and Rachel Liberman, the women's sportswear company, Pullsport, where she developed collections based on European and North American design trends for three decades beginning in the 1950s. Mila and David Zeiger were avid socialites in Brazil, having befriended influential figures of politics, high society and the artistic world. Childhood and Youth Mila was raised by her grandparents in Ukraine. At the age of almost five, she was reunited with her parents, David and Rachel Liberman, who lived in Paris. Because staying at her parents' was not possible‚Äîas the couple lived in a small studio, which during the day worked as a fashion atelier‚ÄîMila was sent to a boarding school for children of Russian immigrants, near Fontainebleau. At the beginning of World War II, the boarding school was closed, and Mila was invited to stay in Biarritz at the home of the aristocratic couple who had previously founded the boarding school. For two years, she attended the local public school. When the Nazi occupation occurred in Paris, Rachel and David Liberman fled with their 11-year-old daughter to Portugal.(In Portuguese) Sousa Mendes Foundation, They remained in Figueira da Foz, a fishing village, for 6 months, at the end of which the family received a visa to immigrate to Brazil.

About  Merry Mansfield, the eponymous character of the novel, is a free-spirited con artist who assists loan sharks or the mob in abducting defaulting fugitives by rear-ending their cars on the highway. Her signature move is to carry a disposable razor and have her pants pulled down at the time of impact, pretending to have been distracted by grooming her pubic region on her way to a hot date - a sight and story that never fails to disorient her hapless targets into giving her a ride, allowing her to guide them to their own abductions. Plot summary Merry completes her latest abduction on the Overseas Highway, only to find that she and her accomplice \\"Zeto\\" have snatched the wrong person: Lane Coolman, a talent manager from Los Angeles on his way to supervise a live appearance at a Key West bar by his firm's most important client, reality television star Buck Nance. Without Coolman present, Buck, who is badly unprepared to give an improvised performance, resorts to telling a few jokes overheard from his brothers, which are quickly decried by the crowd as racist and homophobic slurs. In fear for his safety, Buck flees into the night and hacks off his trademark beard in the kitchen of a closed restaurant. The beard fragments are reported to health inspector Andrew Yancy, a former police detective. While waiting for their real target, Merry and Zeto let Coolman call his boss, who is indifferent to Coolman's safety but discreetly asks Monroe County Sheriff Summers to start a search for Buck. Because of the urgent need to find him quickly, the Sheriff's only detective, Burton, reluctantly asks Yancy to assist with the search. After Zeto announces his intention to kill Coolman and dispose of his body, Merry takes pity on him and allows Coolman to escape while they abduct their real target, Martin Trebeaux, a beach nourishment hustler who delivered faulty sand to the beach behind a Mafia-controlled Boynton Beach hotel. After completing the job, Merry spends the evening in Key West, where she sees Coolman and whimsically decides to spend the evening with him. She meets Yancy when Coolman is called to the site of an accidental death outside their hotel: a Muslim tourist from Brooklyn who was accosted by a raving street person and fell off the city trolley, fatally stabbing himself in the heart with a souvenir being clutched to his chest. Coolman is horrified to be told that the assailant loosely fits Buck's description, and infuriated when Merry leaves him to have dinner with Yancy. Only a few days later, Merry invites herself to stay in Yancy's home on Big Pine Key, saying she enjoyed his company and ignoring his feeble protests that he's in a relationship, even though his girlfriend, Dr. Rosa Campesino, is traveling in Europe, and may be planning to stay permanently. It turns out that Buck has been kidnapped by his \\"biggest fan,\\" an unemployed burglar named Benny \\"Blister\\" Krill. Blister was in the audience at the bar when Buck fled, and ran after him to show his devotion. Obsessed with Buck's TV show, Bayou Brethren, Blister refuses to believe Buck's pleas that the show is an act, and decides to keep Buck hostage until the latter acknowledges their commonality. Blister's impromptu \\"tributes\\" to impress Buck include getting garish tattoos, accosting the Muslim tourist on the tram, and re-kidnapping Coolman. In a burst of inspiration, Blister demands that he be written into Bayou Brethren as Buck's long-lost twin brother. Buck and Coolman try to humor him until they can escape, but start to seriously consider the ploy after seeing the next episode on Blister's television, which has been filmed without Buck. They present their demands to Coolman's boss, Jon \\"Amp\\" Ampergrodt, who cannot afford to ignore Coolman's threat to make Buck and his \\"brother\\" the stars of a rival spin-off that will eclipse Bayou Brethren in popularity. A tattoo artist leads Yancy and Merry to Blister's apartment, but Blister impulsively stabs Yancy in the abdomen with a knife, forcing Merry to rush him to the hospital. Over the next several days, Yancy tries doggedly to apprehend Blister, a job made more difficult by the fact that Buck and Coolman are shielding him, using him as a decoy to gain a more lucrative contract for Buck. After Blister refuses to accept a \\"deal\\" from anyone other than Amp in person, the agency head reluctantly flies to Florida. Rosa's continued absence eventually makes Yancy give in to Merry's attempts to seduce him, after which she disappears, leaving a note at his house encouraging him to go after Rosa in Oslo. Yancy begins a trip to Oslo, but returns to Florida after he realizes during a layover that he has not resolved his own feelings about the case. Merry goes back to Miami and continues her work for the mob, but realizes that Yancy is likely to continue pursuing Blister and may need her help. After tracking Buck, Coolman, and Blister to their hideout, being captured, and escaping, Yancy works out a deal with Coolman to take custody of Blister as soon as Amp signs a new contract doubling Buck's salary. When things go awry during the meeting with Amp, Blister abducts Yancy at gunpoint and forces him to drive the group to the airport. They are intercepted by Merry, who disables their car and distracts Blister with her signature move. Blister realizes the danger and recovers his stolen gun, but Buck, who has had enough of Blister's violent behavior, sneaks up behind him and breaks his neck. The novel incorporates at least three interconnected subplots: *Martin Trebeaux, the beach nourishment scammer, talks his way out of death by offering to replace the faulty beach, and promising huge profits from a new scheme to use sand from Cuba's pristine northern beaches in all future enterprises. His scheme and his life come to an abrupt end when he foolishly allows his Mafia contact's girlfriend to seduce him. *Brock Richardson and his fianc√©e Deb, an obnoxious couple from Miami, plan to build a mansion-sized house on the empty lot next to Yancy's, blocking his prized sunset views; Yancy tries various ploys to delay the construction, but a chance meeting in Key West leads to him doing a small favor for Trebeaux's Mafia capo, who is grateful enough to \\"persuade\\" Richardson to not only abandon the project, but to sell the lot to Yancy for a pittance. *The most serious emergency of Yancy's restaurant inspector career occurs when two Gambian pouched rats are discovered in the kitchen of a Key West eatery, whose co-owner happens to be the city mayor; the rats evade capture for most of the novel, but are finally cornered by the owners and turned over to Yancy for euthanasia; Yancy cannot bring himself to do it, and instead slips them into the luggage of a distracted cruise ship passenger departing Key West for Galveston, Texas, a humane act that Merry finds irresistible. Buck becomes a national hero for his actions in Florida, but he has had enough of celebrity - estranged from his family, harried by his captivity, and badly shaken by the realization that his TV persona has become a role model for violent racists like Blister. He quits Bayou Brethren and moves back to Milwaukee to open a music store. Yancy is saddened, though not surprised, when Rosa breaks up with him, admitting that she prefers Norway's tranquility to Florida's turbulence. Yancy's emotional blow is greatly softened when he returns home and finds Merry waiting for him, having decided that Yancy is too much fun for her to give up (at least for the immediate future).

This is a reference to Megan Barnes, who crashed her car on the Florida Overseas Highway on March 2, 2010, while taking her hands off the wheel to shave her bikini zone; like Merry, Barnes claimed she was on the way to meet her boyfriend in Key West (unlike Merry, Barnes was accompanied by a passenger, her ex-husband, whom she instructed to take the wheel while she shaved).'Razor Girl', A Tale of Kidnappers, Reality TV Stars and Dodgy Seafood\\", url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/05/books/razor-girl-a- tale-of-kidnappers-reality-tv-stars-and-dodgy-seafood.html (last accessed October 9, 2017)\\"Woman Crashes Car Shaving Privates\\", ABC News, url=https://abcnews.go.com/Travel/cops-woman-crashes-car-shaving- privates/story?id=10065885 (last accessed September 17, 2017) *Buck's television show, Bayou Brethren, was conceived as an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Duck Dynasty, after the election of Barack Obama as President of the United States \\"brought a boom in TV reality shows featuring feisty rednecks.\\" (Chapter 5) Similar to Buck, Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson made several comments in a 2013 interview that were instantly criticized as homophobic, which caused his temporary suspension from appearing on the show. **Hiaasen also makes an oblique reference to the similar series Moonshiners, explaining that Bayou Brethren was originally intended to be based on that concept, but it had already been taken by a different network. *Irv Clipowski informs Yancy that he and his partner are planning on getting married on June 23, which is the birth date of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas; Thomas authored a brief dissent in the landmark case of Lawrence v. Texas, in which the majority found a Texas anti-sodomy law to be unconstitutional. Whether Irv and his partner intend this to be a tribute to Thomas (who characterized the law as \\"uncommonly silly\\" and said it should be repealed by the state legislature) or a snub (because Thomas sided with the minority and refused to vote to strike down the law as discriminatory) is unclear.  Allusions to Hiaasen's other works  *Several of the characters, including Yancy, the protagonist, re-appear from Hiaasen's previous novel, Bad Monkey. *Hiaasen's most famous recurring character, Clinton \\"Skink\\" Tyree, has appeared in all of Hiaasen's previous even-numbered novels, Double Whammy (#2), Native Tongue (#4), Stormy Weather (#6), Sick Puppy (#8), Skinny Dip (#10), and Star Island (#12). Razor Girl (#14) breaks the pattern, and neither Skink (nor Jim Time) appear in this book.  Critical reception  Janet Maslin favorably reviewed Razor Girl for the New York Times, stating that the novel \\"meets [Hiaasen's] usual sky-high standards for elegance, craziness, and mike-drop humor.\\" She also commented that the novel's overriding theme was exceptionally poignant to the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election: > It illustrates the dog-whistle effects of bigotry that take the form of > entertainment, with a plot that revolves around a \\"Duck Dynasty\\"-type > reality show, the sermons delivered by one of its stars and a crazed fan who > decides to follow what he thinks are the star‚Äôs teachings.

It‚Äôs what he imagines his > hero would have done. And even if Blister is the only crazed fan turned > abductor with a shot at having his own role on a hit reality show, the book > makes it clear that he is not alone in his delusions. Michael Schaub, reviewing Razor Girl for NPR, likewise praised Hiaasen's deft interweaving of the seemingly chaotic plot elements, and his ability to find humor even when dealing with serious themes: > The plots of Hiaasen's novels are exceedingly difficult to describe. His > stories are as intricate as they are fast-paced, and the sheer number of > characters he includes in each book makes summarizing them next to > impossible, unless you want to sound like a stoner describing The Big > Lebowski to a friend who's never seen it.

It had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 10, 2019 and was released in the United States on July 12, 2019 by Bleecker Street. Plot Casey Davies (Jesse Eisenberg) is a timid and socially awkward accountant. One night on his way home, a masked gang on motorcycles assaults him; the gang has been attacking people throughout the city. While recuperating, Casey decides to purchase a hand gun for protection. After submitting his background check paperwork, he finds a karate d≈çj≈ç led by the charismatic and enigmatic \\"Sensei\\" (Alessandro Nivola). After a trial class Casey decides to take more classes instead of buying the gun. At the d≈çj≈ç Casey meets Anna (Imogen Poots), a brown belt and the only female student of the d≈çj≈ç, and Henry, a friendly blue belt student. Henry explains that Sensei teaches a special night class for select students. Casey's commitment to training impresses Sensei, who promotes him to a yellow belt. At the ceremony, Sensei talks about the greatness of the d≈çj≈ç's now-dead grandmaster, who killed 3 other grandmasters via a secret technique of punching his index finger through their skulls. Sensei invites Casey, but not the eager Henry, to the d≈çj≈ç's more brutal night classes. Henry attends uninvited, and Sensei breaks his elbow at the joint and expels him from the d≈çj≈ç as punishment. In the night classes Sensei encourages Casey to be more \\"masculine.\\" Casey returns to his job much more aggressive, and he is fired after his alpha male attitude leads him to punch his boss. Sensei hires Casey as the d≈çj≈ç's accountant. Sensei tells Casey that one of the masked motorcycle gang members who attacked him is at a bar, and he takes Casey to attack the drunken man. Casey gravely injures him and is surprised to find Sensei videotaping the confrontation. Casey suspects that his victim was innocent. Casey returns home to find his dog has been killed, and he suspects that Sensei was behind it, leading him to confront Sensei the next day. However, when Casey threatens to leave the d≈çj≈ç, Sensei admits that the man Casey injured was innocent and threatens to release the tapes of the assault, prompting Casey to attack and be swiftly defeated by Sensei. During the next night session, Sensei handpicks Casey and several other students to go out on motorcycles that look familiar to Casey. Sensei orders them to attack people who are by themselves. Anna volunteers to accompany the uncertain Casey, whispering that they have to follow Sensei's orders or he will kill them. As partners, Anna and Casey target a man who turns out to be an undercover police officer and who shoots Anna in the leg. Casey kills the cop as Sensei looks on in approval. After this, Sensei informs Casey that he will receive a red stripe on his belt to signify that he killed a man, a mark that Casey previously thought was for instructors after seeing a red stripe on Anna's belt. Casey then drives Anna home, and she reveals that she received her red stripe when she killed a black belt student in self-defense when he tried to assault her in the changing room. However, Sensei blamed the attack on Anna, claiming she tempted a higher ranked student and thus forced her to change in the old equipment room from then on. Anna then urges Casey to leave the d≈çj≈ç. Casey, now very suspicious of Sensei, sneaks into the d≈çj≈ç to investigate further. In the restricted area he finds a working crematorium and video tapes of the students as motorcyclists attacking civilians. Sensei apparently believes that these attacks will strengthen the victims who, like Casey, survive the attack. One of these tapes confirms that Sensei, Anna, and Thomas were the motorcycle assailants who originally assaulted Casey. The video also shows that Anna prevented Thomas from executing Casey. He discovers evidence that Sensei extorts money from the students on the tapes who later left the d≈çj≈ç. When Sensei returns in the morning, he finds that Henry has hanged himself in the middle of the d≈çj≈ç. Unmoved, he incinerates the body using the crematorium. Casey appears and challenges him to a fight to the death. As Sensei bows to initiate the fight, Casey pulls a gun from his gi and shoots Sensei in the head, killing him. When the other night class students arrive, Casey tells them he killed Sensei in a duel by punching his index finger through Sensei's skull-- the technique Sensei had earlier explained only the grandmaster knew (this also implies that the grandmaster actually shot his rivals). Saying that he took but did not earn Sensei's black belt, Casey gives it to Anna, promoting her to a full black belt. Anna becomes the new sensei, teaching compassionate combat rather than ruthless aggression, and Casey begins teaching the children's classes.

Jean-Baptiste Duvoisin was born in Langres, France on 19 October 1744. He received a bachelor's degree from the Sorbonne in Paris and soon joined the university as a professor of theology. The Bishop of Laon later chose him as Vicar-General. During the Revolution, he was exiled in 1792 as a refractory priest, but returned to France following the Concordat of 1801, negotiated between Napoleon Bonaparte and Pius VII, which re-established the Catholic Church in France. He soon attracted the attention of the first consul, who appointed him bishop of Nantes on 5 July 1802 and gave him his full confidence. He was one of the four bishops sent by Napoleon to reside near Pius VII during the Pope's captivity at Savona and Fontainebleau, with the aim of persuading the Pope to reconcile himself with the Emperor. Napoleon I also appointed him an Almoner to the Empress Marie-Louise. Duvoisin died on 9 July 1813 at the age of 68. In 1856 a street was named after him in Nantes.

(1969). ‚ÄúOuimet to urge radical shakeup of Criminal Code.‚Äù The Globe and Mail. Toronto, Ontario. Sept. 25, 1969, p. 47. It was titled Toward Unity: Criminal Justice and Corrections. The title refers to its main, general finding, which was a need for ‚Äúmore effective cooperation among law enforcement agencies, the judiciary and the corrections services,‚Äù as well as to the fact that it was more broad- ranging than previous criminal-justice committees. The overarching theme of the committee's findings, as laid out in eight ‚Äúmain principles‚Äù laid out in Chapter 2, is a call for a move toward rehabilitation and away from punishment in Canada's criminal-justice system.‚ÄúSound report ‚Äì but please, no commission.‚Äù The Globe and Mail.

In this way, it continued on the work began by the Archambault Commission 30 years earlier. McArton contributed a ‚ÄúSeparate Statement‚Äù at the end of the report which functioned much like a judicial dissenting opinion. Though she stated that she agreed with all of the report's conclusions, she felt two issues needed further attention: federal/provincial division of responsibility, and the potential for actors outside the criminal-justice system to combat anti-social behaviour. Her 16-page statement expands upon those issues. Reception The recommendations were received favourably in the popular press at the time.‚ÄúDarts and laurels.‚Äù Toronto Star. Toronto, Canada. Oct. 6, 1969, p. 6. Two days after it was made public, an editorial in the national newspaper The Globe and Mail called the final report ‚Äúan impressive effort to find more just means of dealing with law-breakers‚Äù. A week later, The Toronto Star criticized the head of the Canadian police chiefs‚Äô association for publicly opposing its recommendations. Many of its recommendations were eventually adopted by the federal government, or at least shaped future criminal-justice policy. Correction Service Canada cites the committee's complete condemnation of corporal punishment as a driving force in the practice being abolished in Canada in 1972, three years after the report was released.‚Äú50 Years of Human Rights Developments in Federal Corrections.‚Äù http://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/text/pblct/rht-drt/05-eng.shtml Correction Service Canada.

The federal government also accepted the committee's call to replace the ‚Äúhabitual offender‚Äù and ‚Äúdangerous sexual offender‚Äù designations with a single ‚Äúdangerous offender‚Äù designation. The committee stated in its report that the previous designations included criminals who represented ‚Äúnuisances‚Äù to society without necessarily qualifying as dangerous, and at the same time did not include offenders who did represent a danger to society without having displayed ‚Äúhabitual‚Äù behaviour.

It was designed to charge up to three Qi devices, such as an iPhone and AirPods, and an Apple Watch simultaneously. It was announced on September 12, 2017. Originally planned to be released in early 2018, AirPower failed to materialise, leading to wide speculation over the product's future, until Apple announced on March 29, 2019 it had cancelled the release. Development AirPower was announced on September 12, 2017 at a media event held at Apple's Steve Jobs Theater, in conjunction with the announcement of the iPhone 8, iPhone X, and Wireless Charging Case for AirPods. Following the event, prototype models were available to attendees for hands-on testing.  Issues  Immediately after another media event held the following September, Apple removed almost all mentions of AirPower from its website. There were reportedly several development issues that led to this decision, with heat management, inter-device communication and speed, and mechanical and interference issues all being rumored. Reportedly, the main engineering issue came from including coils for two charging standards, as the Apple Watch uses a proprietary non-Qi standard. Blogger John Gruber, known for his close connections with Apple, wrote that he had heard of issues with the device‚Äôs design: \\"Something about the multi-coil design getting too hot ‚Äî way too hot.

Also in late March, Apple secured a trademark on the AirPower name.Apple Secures Rights to AirPower Trademark Amid Launch Rumors. MacRumors. However, on March 29, 2019, Dan Riccio, Apple‚Äôs senior vice president of Hardware Engineering, said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch: \\"After much effort, we‚Äôve concluded AirPower will not achieve our high standards and we have cancelled the project.\\" The move was unprecedented for Apple as it had never previously cancelled an announced hardware product.Apple Cancels Plan for AirPower Wireless Charger.

ArsTechnica. 9 August 2019.  Specifications   Hardware  The AirPower concept was based on the Qi standard. Apple had intended for it to be capable of charging multiple devices simultaneously, a feature not supported by the Qi standard, though Apple was working towards incorporating it. Apple's intention was that an iPhone being charged would display on its lock screen the charging percentage of other devices being charged, such as AirPods and their charging case which do not have a display. Devices would not need to be carefully aligned on the charging mat due to the presence of over twenty charging coils, which could charge a device regardless of exact position. However, these charging coils in close proximity ran too hot, requiring the charging mat to require power management. The overheating has been one of the reasons attributed to the product's development issues and eventual cancellation.

Carl Fredrik Ralph Alexander Enckell (13 May 1913 Helsinki ‚Äì 18 May 2001 Helsinki) was a Finnish diplomat. Enckell was employed by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs since 1934. He was Secretary of State in Stockholm from 1944 to 1945, in Paris from 1945 to 1950 and in Moscow from 1950 to 1954, and as Head of the Political Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs between 1955 and 1959. Enckell served as Permanent Representative of Finland to the United Nations from 1959 to 1965, Ambassador to Stockholm 1965-1969, OECD Representation in Paris 1969-1976, continued at the Finnish Embassy in Paris, at the same time in Unesco 1972-1976 and in Warsaw from 1976 to 1980. Enckell's successor as Head of the Political Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Ambassador of the United Nations and Ambassador to Stockholm was Max Jakobson. Ralph Enckell received the Special Envoy and Plenipotentiary title in 1957 and was honored as Honorary Professor of Political Science at the University of Turku in 1970. His exceptional merit as a diplomat was awarded in 1978 by the Order of the Lion of Finland. Enckell was known in the diplomatic circles as a colorful person. When the Vietnam War was widely criticized by the Swedish Minister of Education, later Prime Minister Olof Palme condemned the occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Enckell categorically characterized the difference between the neutrality policy of Sweden and Finland: ‚ÄùFinland seeks to manage its relations both east and west as well, Sweden as badly.‚Äù Enckell's words burst into Palme's ears in time, and he was deeply frustrated with his mind.Max Jakobson: Tilinp√§√§t√∂s, s. 101.

Face ID is a facial recognition system designed and developed by Apple Inc. for the iPhone (X, XS, XS Max, XR, 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, 12 Mini, 12, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max) and iPad Pro (third and fourth generation). A successor to Touch ID, the system allows biometric authentication for unlocking a device, making payments, and accessing sensitive data, as well as providing detailed facial expression tracking for Animoji and other features. Initially released in November 2017 with the iPhone X, it has since been updated and introduced to most new iPhone models, and all iPad Pro models. The Face ID hardware consists of a sensor with three modules; a dot projector that projects a grid of small infrared dots onto a user's face, a module called the flood illuminator that reads the resulting pattern and generates a 3D facial map, and an infrared camera which takes an infrared picture of the user. This map is compared with the registered face using a secure subsystem, and the user is authenticated if the two faces match sufficiently. The system can recognize faces with glasses, clothing, makeup, and facial hair, and adapts to changes in appearance over time. Face ID has sparked a number of debates about security and privacy. Apple claims that Face ID is significantly more advanced than Touch ID. It has a significantly less amount of false positives. Still, Face ID has shown issues at separating identical twins. Multiple security features largely limit the risk of the system being bypassed using photos or masks, and only one proof-of-concept attempt using detailed scans has succeeded. Debate continues over the lack of legal protections offered by biometric systems as compared to passcode authentication in the United States. Privacy advocates have also expressed concern about third-party app developers' access to \\"rough maps\\" of user facial data, despite rigid requirements by Apple of how developers handle facial data.  History  Apple announced Face ID during the unveiling of the iPhone X on September 12, 2017. The system was presented as the successor to Touch ID, Apple's previous fingerprint-based authentication technology embedded in the home button of the iPhone 8 and earlier devices. On September 12, 2018, Apple introduced the iPhone XS and XR with faster neural network processing speeds, providing a significant speed increase to Face ID. On October 30, 2018, Apple introduced the third generation iPad Pro, which brings Face ID to the iPad and allows face recognition in any orientation. On September 10, 2019, Apple announced the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max, which all had the third generation Face ID which is 30% faster than Face ID on the iPhone XS.  Technology  Happy Mac icon Face ID is based on a facial recognition sensor that consists of two parts: a dot projector module that projects more than 30,000 infrared dots onto the user's face, and an infrared camera module that reads the pattern. The pattern is encrypted and sent to a local \\"Secure Enclave\\" in the device's CPU to confirm a match with the registered face. The stored facial data is a mathematical representation of key details of the face, and it is inaccessible to Apple or other parties. To avoid involuntary authentication, the system requires the user to open their eyes and look at the device to attempt a match, although this can be disabled through an accessibility setting. Face ID is temporarily disabled and the user's passcode is required after 5 unsuccessful scans, 48 hours of inactivity, restarting the device, or if two of the device's side buttons are held briefly. Apple claimed the probability of someone else unlocking a phone with Face ID is 1 in 1,000,000 as opposed to Touch ID at 1 in 50,000. During initial setup, the user's face is scanned twice from a number of angles to create a complete reference map. As the system is used, it learns about typical variations in a user's appearance, and will adjust its registered face data to match aging, facial hair growth, and other changes using the Neural Engine. The system will recognize a face wearing hats, scarves, glasses, most sunglasses, facial hair or makeup. It also works in the dark by invisibly illuminating the whole face with a dedicated infrared flash module. Authentication with Face ID is used to enable a number of iOS features, including unlocking the phone automatically on wake, making payments with Apple Pay, and viewing saved passwords. Apps by Apple or third party developers can protect sensitive data with a system framework; the device will verify the user's identity and return success or failure without sharing face data with the app. Additionally, Face ID can be used without authentication to track over 50 aspects of a user's facial expression and positioning, which can be used to create live effects such as Animoji or camera filters. Devices with Face ID * iPhone X * iPhone XS * iPhone XS Max * iPhone XR * iPhone 11 * iPhone 11 Pro * iPhone 11 Pro Max * iPhone 12 Mini * iPhone 12 * iPhone 12 Pro * iPhone 12 Pro Max * iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2018) (3rd generation) * iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2020) (4th generation) * iPad Pro 11-inch (2018) (1st generation) * iPad Pro 11-inch (2020) (2nd generation) Safety Face ID uses an infrared flood illuminator and dot projector, though Apple insists that the output is low enough that it will cause no harm to the eyes or skin, and meets 'international safety standards'. They do not, however, recommend the sensor be repaired by third parties, and there is an inbuilt feature to deactivate Face ID should faulty components be found.  Issues   Twins and close relatives  Inconsistent results have been shown when testing Face ID on identical twins, with some tests showing the system managing to separate the two, while other tests have failed. The system has additionally been fooled by close relatives. Apple states that the probability of a false match is different for twins and siblings, as well as children under 13 years of age, as \\"their distinct facial features may not have fully developed\\".  Law enforcement access  Face ID has raised concerns regarding the possibility of law enforcement accessing an individual's phone by pointing the device at the user's face. United States Senator Al Franken asked Apple to provide more information on the security and privacy of Face ID a day after the announcement, with Apple responding by highlighting the recent publication of a security white paper and knowledge base detailing answers. The Verge noted that courts in the United States have granted different Fifth Amendment rights in the United States Constitution to biometric unlocking systems as opposed to keycodes. Keycodes are considered \\"testimonial\\" evidence based on the contents of users' thoughts, whereas fingerprints are considered physical evidence, with some suspects having been ordered to unlock their phones via fingerprint.  Infiltration  Many people have attempted to fool Face ID with sophisticated masks, though most have failed. In November 2017, Vietnamese security firm Bkav announced in a blog post that it had created a $150 mask that successfully unlocked Face ID, but WIRED noted that Bkav's technique was more of a \\"proof-of-concept\\" rather than active exploitation risk, with the technique requiring a detailed measurement or digital scan of the iPhone owner's face, putting the real risk of danger only to targets of espionage and world leaders.  Third-party developers  If the user explicitly grants a third-party app permission to use the camera, the app can also access basic facial expression and positioning data from Face ID for features such as precise selfie filters such as those seen in Snapchat, or game characters mirroring real-world user facial expressions. The data accessible to third parties is not sufficient to unlock a device or even identify a user, and Apple prohibits developers from selling the data to others, creating profiles on users, or using the data for advertising. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Democracy and Technology raised privacy questions about Apple's enforcement of the privacy restrictions connected to third-party access, with Apple maintaining that its App Store review processes were effective safeguards. Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst with the ACLU, has stated that the overall idea of letting developers access sensitive facial information was still not satisfactorily handled, with Stanley telling Reuters that \\"the privacy issues around of the use of very sophisticated facial recognition technology for unlocking the phone have been overblown. The real privacy issues have to do with the access by third-party developers\\".  Use with face masks  During the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks have been employed as a public and personal health control measure against the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Face ID is incompatible with face masks, with Apple stating \\"Face ID is designed to work with your eyes, nose and mouth visible.\\" With the release of iOS 13.5, Apple added a feature that automatically brings up the passcode screen if it detects that the user is wearing a mask. Apple was criticized for not addressing these issues with the release of the iPhone 12, but was praised for the lack of inclusion of Face ID in favor of Touch ID integrated into the power button on the fourth-generation iPad Air.

The film released on 26th October 2018 to a negative critical reception and commercial failure.  Plot  The story opens with Sub-Inspector Vinay Rao (Sudheer Babu) receiving a complaint from a young boy (Master Charith Manas) who claims that his house, along with his parents inside, has gone missing. The claim is validated when Vijay finds that house no. 143 in the colony, the boy‚Äôs house, is missing. Dr. Surya (Ravi Prakash), is a medical practitioner who sponsors an orphanage in the city. A girl from the orphanage goes missing, but the Circle-Inspector (Anantha Prabhu) does not take the case seriously and rebukes Surya. A passenger flight commuting from Colombo to India goes missing, and Deepak Reddy (Nara Rohith) is appointed as the head of the Investigation Unit. Constable Ramarao (Shashank), a part-time private investigator, offers to help Dr. Surya find the missing girl, but this results in the latter getting threatening calls from the kidnapper. Deepak Reddy receives a call from a man, identifying himself as Veera Bhoga Vasantha Rayalu (Sree Vishnu), who claims to have hijacked the missing flight and asks for Inspector Neelima (Shriya Saran). Neelima reveals that there has been a string of serial killings of criminals in the recent past that were linked to a man who identified himself by the same name. Veera Bhoga Vasantha Rayalu demands that in exchange for the release of the 300 hostages, Deepak and his team has to execute a Pan-Indian mission of simultaneously killing 300 criminals. The government accepts the condition and arrangements for the operation are made. Vinay‚Äôs constables discover a key that opens the lock to an old dilapidated house, and the team plan to break into the house, where they believe the kidnappers of the young boy‚Äôs parents reside. Ramarao discovers that an entire racket is at work in kidnapping poor and orphaned young girls, and follows the kidnappers while they are kidnapping another girl, but is discovered and taken to Dr. Surya‚Äôs house, where Ramarao, Surya and the latter‚Äôs wife are killed by the kidnappers. Deepak discovers that Veera Bhoga Vasantha Rayalu‚Äôs claims of hijacking the flight were false after the flight‚Äôs remains were are found in the Indian Ocean, implying that the plane had crashed. Vinay and his team rescue the kidnapped girls and find the head of the kidnappers and gun him to death. Deepak and his team are forced to go ahead with the operation after realizing Veera Bhoga Vasantha Rayalu has another set of 300 individuals as hostages. Meanwhile, a man dressed in a Santa Claus outfit murders the girls Vinay and his team had rescued. Dr. Surya‚Äôs orphaned son, Nikhil (Master Snehith), who was admitted at the orphanage, runs away and dresses up as a girl, hoping to discover the kidnappers, and is successfully taken away. Vinay discovers that his father has committed suicide. Veera Bhoga Vasantha Rayalu, instead of releasing, burns the kidnapped hostages, who are later revealed to also have been criminals. The team manage to find a sketch of his appearance, and trace his location. Meanwhile, Vinay realizes that the house has not gone missing, rather the number plates outside all the houses have been changed to make it look like the boy‚Äôs house has gone missing. The corpses of the boy‚Äôs parents are also discovered. Nikhil escapes from his kidnappers after being discovered. Vinay discovers that the young boy was the one responsible for the murder of his parents, the forging of the missing house, as well as the suicide of his father. It is revealed at this juncture that the story takes place in 3 different timelines;Veera Bhoga Vasantha Rayalu, Nikhil and the boy are all revealed to be the same person. It is revealed that Vinay‚Äôs father, the negligent Circle Inspector, was the head of the kidnappers‚Äô racket that killed Dr. Surya. Years later, the kidnappers themselves adopted Nikhil from the orphanage, not realizing who he was, and were killed by him, which bought Nikhil to Vinay, and he blackmailed Vinay‚Äôs father into suicide. In the present, Deepak, Neelima and an older Vinay corner Nikhil / Veera Bhoga Vasantha Rayalu to a dilapidated building, but the latter successfully escapes from there. An epilogue shows a much older Nikhil, and hints at a sequel.

The film is the sequel to Three Steps Over Heaven. The main actor is Riccardo Scamarcio as Step and the main actress is Laura Chiatti, playing the role of Gin. Another important role is the one of Babi, played by Katy Louise Saunders.  Plot  After spending two years in America to forget Babi, getting away from his mother and trying not to think about the death of his best friend Pollo, Step returns to Rome, aware that everything can start over again. For an unexpected silly, he will know the extravagant and exuberant Geneva Biro called Gin, a girl who in one of the last scenes of the film, finds out that Step had long been behind Step and had always been in love with him, even before Step knew Babi. The two will live a love story made of ups and downs, but when Step is invited to a party with old friends, he meets Babi again, grown up and beautiful, bringing him close to their first time. Step understands to make a mistake and so confesses to Babi that he has fallen in love with another. The latter confessed to Step that he wanted to see him saying that in a few months he would get married. Step confesses to Gin that he has seen Babi and so Gin feeling betrayed and disappointed leaves Step. But in the end, trying to really love her, Step manages to forgive her with a wonderful picture of their kiss in front of the girl's house, followed by the words \\"Ho voglia di te\\".  Reception and critical  Upon release, the film was the subject of controversy for the explicit sex scene between Riccardo Scamarcio and Laura Chiatti and the scene of sexual violence involving Eleonora. Critic Paolo Mereghetti called the film an example of non-cinema.  Differences between the film and the novel  The film presents some substantive differences and omissions relative to the novel. * At the beginning of the film there is no mention of Step's encounter with the hostess on the plane and their subsequent sex relationship in the hotel. * In the novel, Step encounters Gin about a month after his return, not the first night as mentioned in the film. * In the novel, the boy Daniela wants to lose virginity is Chicco Brandelli, but in the film his name is Marco Flamini (Babi's former boyfriend in the book Three Meters Above the Sky). * Paul, Step's brother, does not admit that he also knew of the betrayal of his mother (he had mentioned it in Three Meters Above the Sky). * In the book there is no reference to Chloe's motion while in the movie Step will compete for re-launch. * Babi's father does not have a lover, his wife continues to suspect but in reality her husband simply goes to billiards in his evening outings. In fact, in the book, the lover really does exist and is called Francesca, a color girl he met in the room where in the first book he took Step for a chat and for which he would leave his wife at the end of the book. * In Gin's book, he is subjected to an attempted violence by the two camerino authors, where he will step out by killing two of his colleagues, in the film is Eleonora's friend to undergo it by one author during the party organized for the program. As a result, the trip that Step's leader gave him and Gin as a prize for denouncing the authors was missed. * Marcantonio and Eleonora are together at the end of the film. * There is no mention of the friendship relationship between Step and Gin's mother. * Step's father's new girlfriend is not mentioned. * In the book we talk about the little girl (daughter of the nurse) fascinated by Step's old love story, there is no girl in the movie or the girl's mother. Gin in the book thought of waiting for a child and discovering the last relationship between Step and Babi in the Church. * In the book as a \\"goliardic gesture\\" Step writes \\"I want you\\" in front of Gin's house. In the film, the gesture is made by the writers even more goliardic, the same text covers much of Tiberina Island. * Gin is a virgin in the novel, which is not mentioned in the film.  Soundtrack  The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was composed by Ivan Iusco and mixed at Forum Music Village. \\"Ho Voglia Di Te\\" soundtrack was released in March 2007 on CD including a selection of 20 tracks.

The model was Aline Charigot, later to become Renoir's wife. Influenced by seeing renaissance painting (particularly Raphael's frescoes) in Italy in 1881, these pictures showed a marked change of style from Renoir's previous work. Some commentators consider these are works of great beauty, others that they are vulgar. There has been criticism of the conservation work performed on the 1881 painting. Context Renoir was forty and an established artist when he visited Italy in autumn 1881. Apart from a visit to Algiers earlier in the year he had not been outside metropolitan France and indeed he had never been far from Paris. Ambroise Vollard, who collected his art, reported that Renoir particularly admired the works he saw by Titian and Raphael (including Madonna della seggiola and The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple) as well as Pompeiian and Egyptian frescoes. More practically, in letters home Renoir wrote that he appreciated the beautiful scenery and light, and he hoped to complete many paintings which would attract good prices. He had become dissatisfied with his figure painting (which lived awkwardly beside his impressionist landscapes) and he was pleased to leave Paris where he felt obliged to do society portraits. His visit was very productive and he shipped back to Paris several crates of paintings. Note: White a major biographer of Renoir. The model for Blonde Bather was his girlfriend, favourite model, and future wife Aline Charigot who was with him for part of his trip. Charigot had earlier in 1881 been included in Renoir's Le d√©jeuner des canotiers (Luncheon of the Boating Party) where she is the woman with the little dog, on the left. She appeared in many of his paintings ‚Äì in 1882 Danse √† la campagne (Dance in the Country). Blonde Bather (1881) Blonde Bather (1881), Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute Description The painting, now owned (and displayed) by the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute (\\"The Clark\\") in Williamstown, Massachusetts, is oil on canvas and Renoir explained that the picture was painted on board a boat in the Bay of Naples. On his return to Paris Renoir sold or gave the painting to Henri Vever, a modern art collector, and signed the canvas adding a dedication to Vever. Despite Renoir's claim, the scene is not as from a boat. The figure appears to be seated beside the shore ‚Äì behind her back there seems to be grass. However, the background has been altered after the original painting had been done. In 1926 the American art collector Sterling Clark purchased the painting after some uncertainty. His wife Francine thought the work was a marvel; Clark thought that he had never seen finer painting in terms of colour but it might become difficult to live with. He felt the price was excessive at $100,000 thinking it would only fetch $60,000 at auction. Barbara White describes the appearance of the model as \\"rotund\\". Assessments Renoir's biographer, Barbara White, considers 1881 marks a significant change of style for Renoir's nudes ‚Äì a new style he was to perpetuate ‚Äì \\"A new classical impressionism inspired by the Italian frescoes ... a formal timeless view of a sober and sensuous figure\\". Renoir's friends in Paris also regarded it as a distinct change of style ‚Äì the figure's contours are soft and, apart from the wedding ring, there are no signs of modernity. Renoir wrote \\"So, by studying out of doors I have ended up by seeing only the broad harmonies without any longer preoccupying myself with the small details that dim the sunlight rather than illuminating it.\\" He had been influenced by Raphael's frescoes at Villa Farnesina such as Triumph of Galatea and so, writing from Rome, he said he had come to admire grandeur and simplicity. According to White he achieved these qualities for the first time in this painting. The Clark art gallery says the painting \\"gives the nude a monumental presence that suggests a timeless image of womanhood\\". Conservation Sterling Clark regarded Renoir of one of the greatest ever painters and he considered that his very best work was done around 1881. Clark was antipathetic to art restoration ‚Äì in his will he prohibited any restoration of his bequests. On his death in 1956 most of his Renoirs were pictured in Life in probably a completely unrestored condition. On the occasion of a 2012 Royal Academy exhibition From Paris a Taste for Impressionism Michael Daley took the opportunity to compare the Life photographs, one taken of Blonde Bather in 1996, and one in the exhibition catalogue, which show progressively that the contrast in the background has weakened and a halo effect has appeared around the body. Daley considers this could not be due to photographic variation but rather that the painting (and the exhibited paintings generally) have been over-cleaned at least twice since 1956. Brian Sewell made the same point referring to The Clark paintings generally: \\"Many of the paintings in the exhibition have been left a little raw by their conservators‚Äô activities with Brillo pad and wire brush.\\" Blonde Bather (1882) Blonde Bather (1882), Pinacoteca Giovanni e Marella Agnelli Description Back in Paris in spring 1882 Renoir painted a second version, , mainly distinguished from the original by brighter background colours and a line of cliffs apparent in the distance. It is now owned by Pinacoteca Giovanni e Marella Agnelli (Giovanni and Marella Agnelli Gallery) in Turin and is on public display. It was undertaken at his dealer Paul Durand-Ruel's request ‚Äì he had already found a purchaser. After returning from a working holiday in Spain with his young family in 1933, Kenneth Clark, later to become the famous British art historian, wrote to his mentor Bernard Berenson: \\"We are consoled by the purchase of two small Renoirs which would make Mary sick but to me are exquisitely lovely.\\" These were the 1882 Blonde Bather and the Femme en Blouse Blanch of 1907. Once back home, Marcus Leith photographed Clark standing nonchalantly in front of his newly acquired prize and much later the photograph itself became a famous image of the patrician Lord Clark. Blonde Bather remained one of his favourite paintings but Clark always worried about becoming impoverished so in 1959 he sold it for ¬£120,000. Assessments Edward Lucie-Smith wrote of Kenneth Clark in 2014: \\"He also once owned ... a large icing-sugar sweet Renoir nude from the early 1880s, now in the Pinacoteca Agnelli in Turin. This flamboyantly vulgar object would undoubtedly excite new-rich billionaire collectors if it appeared today in a Sotheby's or Christie's auction\\". Clark‚Äôs prot√©g√© Victor Pasmore said the Renoir nude \\"set his teeth on edge\\" and he painted a parody of it which Clark willingly purchased. On the other hand, Dallas Museum of Art calls the 1882 version \\"This superb second painting\\". Chalk study (1880‚Äì1881) Chalk study (1880‚Äì81) There exists a red chalk study on wove tissue paper mounted on board, owned by the Dallas Museum of Art. The museum regards it as \\"among the most important surviving drawings by Renoir\\" and say it relates to the 1881 painting, without question. It was first drawn in pencil and then developed in chalk. Renoir sold it to Ambroise Vollard, his art dealer. The drawing was probably made from life before commencing the 1881 oil painting but there is no sign that it was used to transfer an initial outline to the canvas. Renoir also made an oil study, , for the 1881 painting.

Education  Siddell attended the Avondale College (Art teacher: R.N.Field), Auckland Post Primary Teacher's College (1964‚Äì65), Auckland University Summer School (1967, tutored by Colin McCahon), night classes at the Auckland Society of Arts (1970, tutored by Louise Henderson), and night classes at the Auckland Technical Institute (1975‚Äì76).  Career  Drawing on the tradition of the European vanitas, or allegorical still life, Siddell's work often depicts inanimate, familiar, and ordinary objects, giving them a sense of vibrancy and reflects on the joys, sorrows, struggles, and frustrations of daily existence. Examples of this include her still life paintings, Fire and Water (2002) and Out of the Frying Pan (2007). Her exhibition Couches, at the Artis Gallery in 2005, is another example of how she instilled life and character into ordinary domestic objects, animating them with a sense of personality.  Exhibitions  From 1975 onward Siddell exhibited regularly throughout New Zealand and her work is held in private and public collections, both in New Zealand and internationally. Notable exhibitions at the Artis Gallery include Fragments of Life (2000), A Rich Life (1998), and Couches (2005). In 1994 she took part in the exhibition Unruly Practices at Auckland Art Gallery. The project was a series of solo projects by feminist artists living in Auckland, including work by Carole Shepherd, Claudia Pond Eyley, Mary McIntyre, Christine Hellyar. Honours and awards In 1983 Siddell was award the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council Grant to study printmaking and develop etching, lithography and hand painted screen printing techniques. In the 2002 Queen's Birthday and Golden Jubilee Honours, Siddell was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to painting.

The corallites are small and pentagonal, giving the surface of the coral a pitted appearance when the polyps are retracted. When the polyps are extended to feed, the surface appears fuzzy. This coral is pale blue, lilac or purple in colour. Distribution and habitat P. branneri is native to shallow water habitats in the southern Caribbean Sea and the northern coasts of South America. Its range includes Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, and northern and eastern Brazil, between Cear√° and Cabo Frio. It occurs on reefs, in channels and pools in the intertidal zone, in places with vigorous movement of water, to a maximum depth of . Status The greatest threat that this coral faces is loss of habitat due to damage to the shallow water reefs where it lives. It is susceptible to coral diseases but fairly resistant to coral bleaching. In general it is an uncommon species, although it is rather more common growing among thickets of Acropora palmata in the southern Caribbean.

History The configuration of the air defense gun M1931 owed much to the design of the contemporary Vickers 3-inch anti-aircraft guns. The Soviet M1931 like the Vickers gun had a two-wheeled carriage with collapsible cruciform outriggers. The M1931 was replaced in production in 1938 by the 76 mm air defense gun M1938 which had a four-wheeled dual-axle carriage with two collapsible outriggers. The M1931 and M1938 had nearly identical performance and were gradually replaced by the more powerful 85 mm air defense gun M1939. A number of M1931 guns were captured by Finland during the Winter War and were employed by them as the 76 ItK/31 ss during World War II. Likewise, M1931 guns captured by the Germans were given the designation 7.62 cm Flak M.31(r) and used until they were either worn out or their ammunition supply ran out. A few were rebored to fire German 8.8 cm ammunition and redesignated the 7.62/8.8 cm Flak M.31(r). However, the majority were scrapped in 1944.

Biography  H√©l√®ne Viannay was born in Paris to Russian parents, who had emigrated to Paris in 1908 after being twice imprisoned by the Czarist government. Her mother, Marie Kopiloff, who had given free medical care to workers in Russia, began medical studies at the Sorbonne, which were interrupted by the First World War. She joined the Red Cross and her husband, Isra√´l, fought with French forces. Soon after the war, he returned to support the Russian Revolution. H√©l√®ne would never know him. She succeeded brilliantly at public school. To a professor who scolded students for falling behind her‚Äîa Russian girl‚Äîshe responded, In fact, as she wrote later, her \\"will to French identification\\" caused her to distance herself from her family's Russian culture. She continued her studies at the Sorbonne as a geography student, despite the death of her mother on November 15, 1937. H√©l√®ne Mordkovitch was supported by her professor L√©on Lutaud, who located an endowment for her and asked her to become his assistant in the laboratory of Physical Geography and Dynamic Geology, which was practically deserted after the exodus at the onset of occupation in the Summer of 1940. It was there she met, at the beginning of the school year in September, Philippe Viannay, a philosophy student seeking a certificate in geography. D√©fense de la France Both r√©sistants since the Armistice, they decided not to escape to London, but to oppose Germany from within their Parisian university milieu by writing an underground newspaper in the mold of La libre Belgique, published in occupied Belgium during the First World War. On July 14, 1941, the first official issue of D√©fense de la France was published by Viannay, her husband, fellow student Robert Salmon, and the financial support of friend and escaped prisoner Marcel Lebon who financed the purchase of a Rotaprint, a Czech offset printing machine. The newspaper was printed at the residence of an acquaintance's mother, Saint-Jacques, then at Philippe's parents home, and finally in the immense basement of the Sorbonne until 1942. Later in life, Viannay would learn that the first printing press in France was brought here by Guillaume Fichet, himself an ancestor of a fellow r√©sistant, Octave Simon. In fact, as a volunteer on-site firefighter in the Sorbonne Geology laboratory since 1939, H√©l√®ne possessed keys to the university's entrance on rue Cujas. The motto of the journal is a quotation from Pascal: \\"I only believe stories told by those witnesses who are willing to have their throats cut.\\". (video) It would be in production until the Liberation, its circulation having reached 450,000 copies in January 1944. Philippe and H√©l√®ne married in 1942. Their first child, Pierre, was born in hiding the following year, while they were under pursuit. Philippe could not be present at the birth. Until the end of the war, H√©l√®ne Viannay organized the circulation of the paper and the mass production of False Papers for those resisting forced labor. The Maquis of Ronquerolles In 1944, she joined the Maquis of Ronquerolles (Seine-et-Oise Nord), directed by her husband, and thereby assured the communication between different sectors and between the maquis and Paris. After her husband was injured, she maintained the coordination of different sectors on her own. In a shocking example of the thoughtless continuance of the traditional subordination of women, even within the Resistance, H√©l√®ne Viannay, despite possessing higher credentials than her husband, never dreamed of writing an article for the publication, although she and the other directors' spouses attended all the writing meetings. Later on, she loved to bring up the fact that, despite her service to the resistance, she, like all other French women, had to wait until the 1960s to be permitted to use a checkbook or buy a piece of furniture without the approval of her husband... Center for the Training of Journalists  Just after the war, the Viannays started the Center for the Training of Journalists (Centre de Formation des Journalistes) in Paris, whose operations continue to this day. Many well-known journalists and personalities, from Patrick Poivre d'Arvor to Pierre Lescure and Bernard Pivot. The Nautical Center of the Gl√©nans In 1947, they also founded the Nautical Center of the Gl√©nans (Le Centre nautique des Gl√©nans), which initially served to convalesce many deportees and battle- weary r√©sistants. H√©l√®ne assumed the function of general representative and managed the association from 1954 until retirement in 1979. * In 1991, she participated in the creation of the prix Philippe Viannay-D√©fense de la France.

She said she studied law in self-defense, and urged all women to devote some time to this helpful branch of education. She organized the Woman's State Bar Association, when she was elected president. It was the first organization of its kind in the West, and the object was educational and for mutual improvement in the profession. Early life Victoria Geraldine Conkling was born in 1859 near Columbus, Ohio. Received her earliest education in the university town of Westerville, Ohio. On the death of her father, David Conkling, an attorney, her mother, Cynthia A. Hill, also an attorney, brought her family to Missouri, where a brother had preceded them, and they made Missouri their home. Both her parents were of Colonial ancestry. She was of the seventh generation, on her mother's side, from John Alden and Priscilla De Molineux, who, with her father, mother and brother, all French Huguenots, came to New England with others of that immortal band, in the Mayflower, in 1620. William De Molineux was the tenth, and John Alden the seventh signer of the \\"Mayflower Compact,\\" the first declaration of equal rights ever promulgated. The Conklings came to New England in 1638. That they and their descendants were loyal to the principle of freedom is shown by the fact that there were 145 stalwart men enrolled in the army and navy of the Revolutionary War. On her mother's side she numbers both the Adams, John Adams and John Quincy Adams, the Poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Bryant, Major-General John Mason, for thirty years Commander-in-Chief of the Colonial Armies, and hero of the Pequot War. Major Daniel Mason also. Whitney was eligible to each and every Colonial and Revolutionary Society in the United States. Victoria Conkling- Whitney's ancestry included a distinguished line of lawyers and statesmen on both sides, and therefore her love for law and politics was an inherited one. She was first admitted to practice in Kingman, Kansas. The examining board consisted of three lawyers appointed by the Judge of the Circuit Court; when it was announced in court that the report was ready to be made, the Judge suspended all proceedings, the chairman commending her examination to the women of Kansas as worthy of their emulation. After coming to St. Louis, Whitney went before the St. Louis Court of Appeals, and was the first woman ever admitted before it. Later the Supreme Court of her adopted State convened in special session to admit her to practice, adjourning immediately thereafter, when the entire bench with the Chief Justice offered congratulations. She was later, while on a business journey to Washington, introduced by the Hon. Belva Ann Lockwood to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, and they also convened in special session to admit her to practice. After this she went before the Supreme Court of New York, being presented by Gen. Roger Atkinson Pryor, himself a foremost member of the Supreme Judiciary. Her papers were prepared, and she took the oath the same day ‚Äî a distinction not often conferred on applicants. Career Having had some litigation in the courts over private property and finding that her ignorance of the law was likely to cause her to lose it, Victoria Conkling- Whitney took up the study and worked eight and ten hours a day until she passed the examination. Whitney said law was a difficult study; yet women would be successful because they were painstaking and conscientious and willing to put in unflinching application to study. Her opinion was that women's clubs and organizations would be spending their time more practically and beneficially by studying law instead of taking delicatessen doses of Browning and Mendelssohn. Women left with estates to manage or those owning property were entirely at the mercy of their attorneys. Whitney believed that law ought to be a part of the curriculum of every school as much as mathematics and literature. It would make woman less dependent and gave her self-confidence. Whitney engaged in practice with her brother. Judge Conkling, in Missouri, but before relocating in St. Louis went to Washington and was admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States, and the Department of the Interior. One of her experiences was as a teacher in the Boonville public schools, and for a year a member of the faculty of the State University, Department School of Mines, in Rolla, Missouri. Her role was Assistant in Preparatory Department, and Recording Secretary. It was at this time she met her future husband, Professor Geordie Z. Whitney, Librarian. Whitney believed in equal Suffrage, and as president of the regular Missouri Equal Suffrage Association, conducted four campaigns at Jefferson City, Missouri, for a constitutional amendment giving the women citizens of Missouri the right of franchise, herself drafting the amendinent which went unanimously to engrossment, but expired in the Senate with six hundred other bills at the close of the session. Whitney, with the chairman of the committee, had the honor of being invited to address the House of Representatives in Committee of the Whole, an honor which had never been conferred on any woman before save Dorothy Dix. In 1900, in New York City, at a meeting of leading and representative women held at the Park Avenue Hotel, Whitney' helped to organize the National Legislative League, of which she was elected a member of the executive committee. To Lillie Devereux Blake, as leader, much credit is due for the passage of the many laws for the benefit of women now on the statute books of that state. The Missouri State Suffrage Association became an auxiliary to the National Legislative League in its organization. It was identical with and the successor to the first Equal Suffrage Association formed by Virginia Minor in 1864, including in its membership such names as James Yeatman, Benjamin Gratz Brown, Elizabeth Avery Meriwether, Mrs. Beverly Allen, Rev. W. W. Boyd, Rev. John Snyder, Sophronia Wilson Wagoner, and was the first organization to propose a movement to place women as members of the St. Louis School Board. During the Cuban War the association took an active part in the work for the soldiers. The association also sent delegates ‚Äî Dr. H. T. Wilcox and Rev. John Snyder ‚Äî to the first meeting held to organize the Good Roads Movement that grew into national importance. Whitney's practice was in the civil courts. For a number of years she had in view the formation of a woman's bar association, and on July 14, 1912, organized the Woman's State Bar Association, when she was elected president. The meetings were held at the Planters Hotel. It was the first organization of its kind in the West, and the object was educational and for mutual improvement in the profession. An annual banquet was held, and eminent jurists were from time to time invited to give addresses before it. Among the laws it favored is to appoint a duly qualified woman lawyer for Judge of the Juvenile Court; in a strong measure it also favored prison reforms. Among its honorary members were Hon. Belva Lockwood, author of the bill admitting women to practice in the United States Supreme Court; Mrs. Marilla Ricker, who had an immense practice in Washington, and was the only living woman at the time who ever sat on the woolsack beside the Lord Chief Justice of England; Clara Shortridge Foltz, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney of Los Angeles, and Phoebe Couzins. Whitney was the vice- president of the Missouri International Peace Society, organized by the Princess Wizniewski (nee Hugo) and the Baroness Von Suttner. Personal life On April 14, 1886, Victoria Conkling married Geordie Z. Whitney (1855-1889), Professor of Mathematics and Secretary of the Faculty at University of Missouri School of Mines.

The show is the biggest show of the year for CMLL, considered their version of the Super Bowl or WrestleMania. The CMLL Anniversary Show is the longest- running annual professional wrestling shows. The show featured two separate Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet matches\\". In the first match Zeuxis defeated Princesa Sugehit, forcing her to take off her mask, and the second match saw Gran Guerrero defeat Niebla Roja to unmask him. The show featured four additional matches. Flip Gordon worked on the undercard, representing the US based Ring of Honor through their working relationship with CMLL and Satoshi Kojima worked on the undercard with Gordon, representing the Japanese-based New Japan Pro-Wrestling through their working relationship with CMLL. Production Background Arena M√©xico, CMLL's main venue and location of the 84th Anniversary Show The Mexican Lucha libre (professional wrestling) company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) started out under the name Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (\\"Mexican Wrestling Company\\"; EMLL), founded by Salvador Lutteroth in 1933. Lutteroth, inspired by professional wrestling shows he had attended in Texas, decided to become a wrestling promoter and held his first show on September 21, 1933, marking what would be the beginning of organized professional wrestling in Mexico. Lutteroth would later become known as \\"the father of Lucha Libre\\" . A year later EMLL held the EMLL 1st Anniversary Show, starting the annual tradition of the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre Anniversary Shows that have been held each year ever since, most commonly in September. Over the years the anniversary show would become the biggest show of the year for CMLL, akin to the Super Bowl for the National Football League (NFL) or WWE's WrestleMania event. The first anniversary show was held in Arena Modelo, which Lutteroth had bought after starting EMLL. In 1942‚Äì43 Lutteroth financed the construction of Arena Coliseo, which opened in April 1943. The EMLL 10th Anniversary Show was the first of the anniversary shows to be held in Arena Coliseo. In 1956 Lutteroth had Arena M√©xico built in the location of the original Arena Modelo, making Arena M√©xico the main venue of EMLL from that point on. Starting with the EMLL 23rd Anniversary Show, all anniversary shows except for the EMLL 46th Anniversary Show have been held in the arena that would become known as \\"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\\". On occasion EMLL held more than one show labelled as their \\"Anniversary\\" show, such as two 33rd Anniversary Shows in 1966. Over time the anniversary show series became the oldest, longest-running annual professional wrestling show. In comparison, WWE's WrestleMania is only the fourth oldest still promoted show (after CMLL's Arena Coliseo Anniversary Show and Arena M√©xico anniversary shows). EMLL was supposed to hold the EMLL 52nd Anniversary Show on September 20, 1985 but Mexico City was hit by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. EMLL canceled the event both because of the general devastation but also over fears that Arena M√©xico might not be structurally sound after the earthquake. When Jim Crockett Promotions was bought by Ted Turner in 1988 EMLL became the oldest still active promotion in the world. In 1991 EMLL was rebranded as \\"Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre\\" and thus held the CMLL 59th Anniversary Show, the first under the new name, on September 18, 1992. Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, replacing their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. The 2017 show will commemorate the 84th anniversary of CMLL and will, against tradition, be held on a Saturday instead of a Friday. The September 16 date coincides with the Mexican Independence day celebrations. Storylines The 84th Anniversary Show featured six professional wrestling matches scripted by CMLL with some wrestlers involved in scripted feuds. The wrestlers portray either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that play the part of the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they perform.

During the 1790s, when the second Xhosa Wars broke out, Stuurman, his brother Klaas, the chief‚Äô and their family abandoned Vermaak's farm along with several other Khoi in the region.

They refused to return to the farms they were indentured on and many went to live at the Bethelsdorp Mission Station, near Algoa Bay.

Ancient Greek funerary vases are decorative grave markers made in ancient Greece that were designed to resemble liquid-holding vessels. These decorated vases were placed on grave sites as a mark of elite status. There are many types of funerary vases, such as amphorae, kraters, oinochoe, and kylix cups, among others. One famous example is the Dipylon amphora. Every-day vases were often not painted, but wealthy Greeks could afford luxuriously painted ones. Funerary vases on male graves might have themes of military prowess, or athletics. However, allusions to death in Greek tragedies was a popular motif. Famous centers of vase styles include Corinth, Lakonia, Ionia, South Italy, and Athens.  Uses  thumb Men lying down and drinking at a symposium. Attic red-figure bell-krater, c. 420 B.C. One major type of funerary vase was the krater, a mixing bowl for wine and water used by elite Greek males at symposiums. Symposiums were an eastern influence in which the aristocracy would lie down and drink; many Greek painters referenced this lifestyle in their art. The krater was so symbolic of elite status that large, richly decorated kraters would be placed upon grave sites. Although in the shape of drinking vessels, some funerary kraters were made just to be a grave marker, as indicated by a hole in the bottom of the vessel. This hole would allow libations to drain through. The display of highly decorated funeral vase markers, along with costly grave goods, and elaborate processions, helped to display the status of wealthy families. This act is called conspicuous consumption, and would let the whole community know who held power in the region.  Types  The amphora was a tall, slender pot that often held oil, wine, milk, or grain. These could be as tall as an adult, and were both practical for transporting goods, and artistic in their funerary usage. Amphorae filled with oil were awarded to victorious athletes during Panathenaic games, with the winner painted on it. These might be placed on the grave of the athlete. The Lekythos was another style of funerary vase that usually held ritual oil. It had a slender body with a single handle. One famous artist of lekythoi was the Achilles painter. Funeral lekythoi were often painted in the white ground technique. The kylix (kylikes, plural), popular at symposiums, was a stout drinking cup with a very wide bowl. A well known potter of kylikes was Exekias. After being formed separately on the potter's wheel, the bowl and stem would be left to dry. The cup would then be placed upside down to attach the handles. The handles would dry in this upside down position, giving the handles a unique upturned curve when the kylix was upright. An oinochoe was a stout wine jug with a distinct pouring lip, and a large handle. The name comes from oinos (wine), and cheo (to pour). Some of these have relief sculpture under the bowl. There are two other variations of oinochoe that differ in size and style, called olpe and chous. The hydria was a water-containing vessel with three handles; two for carrying, and another for pouring. These could also be made out of bronze. A well preserved example is the Regina Vasorum from Southern Italy. The Regina Vasorum has black lacquer with gilding. Demeter, Athena, Artemis, Aphrodite, and Dionysus can all be seen on this hydria.  Iconography  Euphronios krater depicting Hypnos (left) and Thanatos (right) carrying dead Sarpedon, with Hermes in the middle. Attic red-figured calyx-krater, 515 BC. Geometric patterns adorn many vases between 900-700 B.C. These patterns include meanders, right-angles, and swastikas. Most vases from this period were found in cemeteries, thus becoming our primary source of knowledge during the Geometric period. In the 600s B.C., Athens moved away from abstract geometric patterns, and toward more natural art, influenced by the Near East. Images from vases can provide information about religion, beliefs, and how people lived, including burial rites. Burial customs included washing and dressing the body in ointments before wrapping the body in a shroud and outer cloth. The body would then be laid upon a bier, or funeral bed, which gives form to the Greeks' association between sleep and death. Thanatos, the god of gentle death, can be seen on Greek funerary vases taking away the body of the deceased to the underworld. The act of laying out the body for mourners to see, called prothesis, is painted on the Dipylon amphora. The next step was the ekphora; the moving of the body to a cemetery in a procession. If cremation was practiced, the ashes of the deceased would be placed inside the funeral vase, and buried. thumb Dipylon amphora, mid-700's B.C. detail of laying out the body (prothesis).  Social connections  Kylikes, used at symposiums, would often be painted with large eyes on them. When drinking from these eye-cups, they would act as a mask, like actors would wear in a play. These eyes would stare at the other guests, with the handles resembling ears. The Greek word for handle is \\"ous\\", meaning ear. The altered state of mind that comes from drinking alcohol is analogous to putting on the mask of someone else. This connection between wine, masks, and stories told at symposiums were all embodied in the god Dionysus, the god of wine and theater.  Tragedy on vases  thumb Exekias's vase depicting the suicide of Ajax Greek tragedies were a popular motif on funeral vases which often contained the death of someone close to the main character within the play. An example of this is the suicide of Ajax vase. Greeks would see these pictures of Greek tragedies on vases, which would remind them of the suffering that heroes of old had to endure. They believed that If great heroes were able to survive life's sufferings, then so could they. In this way, they could view tragedy as something comforting, thus giving people the strength to persevere. Through visual depictions of tragedies, the Greeks could relate to the deceased. Pots that depict funerary scenes were usually designed for tombs. However, vases with comical motifs have also been found in graves.

Presser (1876-1946). He graduated from Kaiser-Wilhelm-Realgymnasium in Berlin in 1920 and studied art history, classical archeology, East Asian art history and theater history in Berlin, Munich and Freiburg from 1920 to 1925. In 1925 he promoted as Dr. phil. in Freiburg with a work supervised by Hans Jantzen on history of stage design. Career From 1925 to 1928, Scharf worked as research assistend at Kupferstichkabinett department of Berlin State Museums, Kaiser Friedrich Museum and Kunstbibliothek. During his time at the Kupferstichkabinett he took part in the work of the catalog of Dutch masters. From 1928 to 1932, Scharf worked as a freelance writer, among others as editor of the magazine Der Cicerone and Weltkunst. His plans to habilitate with a postdoctoral dissertation on Filippino Lippi at the University of Frankfurt failed because of his Jewish descent and the anti-semitic currents at the University of Frankfurt. He then emigrated to Great Britain in May 1933 , where he intervened with the help of Jewish aid organizations and the SPSL . In 1933/34 he gave lectures at the Courtauld Institute of the University of London. He then worked as a freelance art expert and consultant. He also contributed to a project on the Renaissance art known in the Renaissance at the Warburg Institute in London. He also worked for the National Art Collection Fund. In 1946 he was naturalized as a British citizen. In the spring of 1940, Reichsicherheitshauptamt, in Berlin, placed him on the special search list GB , a list of persons who, in the event of a successful invasion and occupation of the British Isles by the Wehrmacht, the special commander of the SS, following the occupation groups, should be identified and arrested with particular priority. Scharf's focus was on Italian painting of the fifteenth century, Dutch and Flemish painting of the 17th century, as well as drawings and graphics from the 15th to the 18th century. Family Scharf was married to Felicie Radziejewski, who, as an art historian, published Felicie Scharf under her own name and worked as an art dealer from 1966 onwards. Both had a daughter, Ursula, born in 1930. She married David Price in 1955. They had two children, Martin (born 1957) and Stephanie (born 1958; known as Steffie).

Apart from these differences, it is known that the construction of the mosque was done following the proliferation of Islam in the Solok region begun in the 16th century.

Life Amelia Elizabeth Guppy was born at Bullingham Court in Hertfordshire on 21 November 1808, the eldest child of wealthy parents Richard Parkinson (abt 1782-1851) and Lucy (1788-1834), n√©e Lechmere, daughter of Royal Navy officer William Lechmere, Vice-Admiral of the White living at Kinnersley Castle. She studied art under David Cox. She eloped to marry Robert Guppy, a member of the Bar of the Middle Temple, on 12 Nov 1834 at Bitterley Court, Shropshire, even though the marriage was approved by both families, perhaps to avoid a society marriage. They moved to Trinidad in 1837 and lived at La Falaise estate, Pointe-a-Pierre Road, Naparima Hill, San Fernando. Her husband, Robert, was assisting the Protheroe relatives of Amelia's brother-in-law, Samuel Guppy, Jr., with the legal issues around the emancipation of the slaves on the Protheroe plantations in the south of Trinidad. Robert later became Mayor of San Fernando for many years. Amelia was a painter and photographer, and spent much time in Trinidad painting the local scenery and plants, particularly the orchids. She loved orchids, collected, them, painted, named and classified them, and even planted them in trees around her house. She spent time sketching travelling around the island on a white mule, sometimes for days at a time, with a young man, Thorpe, whom she trained to be her assistant. In later years she had a house built for her in the trees where she could stay in safety. Life in Trinidad did not suit Amelia well, as she valued intellectual companionship, and she regularly returned to England. Her granddaughter, Yseult (Guppy) Bridges, in her memoir, \\"Child of the Tropics\\", says, \\"She was a lady of wildly independent mould and adventurous spirit.\\", and \\"She missed the intellectual and artistic stimulus of the circles in which she had moved in England, and found her society [in Trinidad] restricted to that of people whose interests and outlook were severely limited. . . She found them boring and tedious, and they found her incomprehensible and alarming.\\" Still life with ancient Babylonian artifacts on books, salted paper print, 1853, Houghton Library Stekesley (sic) Castle; Attributed to Amelia Elizabeth Guppy Her earliest known picture is of her child in 1847. In 1854 she recorded Stokesay Castle. She is known for her photographs including the many she made for the eccentric English bibliophile Thomas Phillipps. Her children included Robert John Lechmere Guppy who was brought up at Kinnersley Castle by Richard and Lucy Parkinson. Her other children were Lucy Lechmere Guppy (1835-1907), who married Theodore Walter, Henry Francis Jeune Guppy (1839-1872), who married Alida Wigger, and Marguerite Eleamire Clotilda Guppy (1840-1872) who married John Percy. All the children were raised by their grandparents, Francis and Lucy being sent to Robert's parents, Samuel and Sarah Guppy, in Clifton, when the couple moved to Trinidad. Amelia's son Henry Francis Jeune Guppy and his wife, Alida Wigger, are the ancestors of the Guppy families of Paraguay, Argentina and Chili. In 1871,at the age of 63 she set out on an adventure to Venezuela. She travelled alone around the Orinoco River, up which no white person had previously travelled for any distance, keen to capture the orchids there. Amelia Guppy died in 1886 in Trinidad, and is buried in San Fernando. Many of her works were destroyed by being stored badly during the second world war. Her granddaughter, Yseult Bridges, says, \\"She died in 1886, . . . and old woman burned out by her own flame . . . Even sixty years later her beauty, her distinction and her exploits were still legendary in Trinidad: the 'mad Mrs Guppy' who lived in the jungle in a tree house; while even outside the island there were those who remembered her.\\" Works * Photographs at Middle Hill by Guppy and Sir Thomas Phillipps, 1846‚Äì53 * Photographs of the MS. roll of Homer's Iliad., 1862 *Mrs. Guppy's photographs of charters, seals, & antiquities at Middle Hill.

The Minangkabau architecture is thought to have been built in 1840, which was originally covered with fiber roofs before being replaced with zinc. Currently other than being used for Muslim worship activities, this single-level mosque is also used by the surrounding community as a means of religious education.  History  It is not known when exactly the mosque was begun building. According to an author Abdul Baqir Zein in his book entitled Historical Mosques in Indonesia, the mosque was estimated to be built in 1840 and named after its establishment, Koto Nan Ampek Nagari. The construction was led by three different leaders from respective tribes in Minangkabau: Datuk Kuniang from the Kampai tribe, Datuk Pangkai Sinaro from Piliang tribe, and Datuk Siri Dirajo from Malayu tribe. Although it is one of the oldest mosques, most of the masts, floors, and walls made of wood have never been replaced since the first time the mosque was built. The mosque hasn't undergone many renovations thus its authenticity is still maintained. Because of erosion, however, the roof which was originally made from fibers was then replaced with zinc.

Social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and many more have their own individual ways of tracking, analyzing and reporting the traffic on each of the individual platforms. Each platform allows their users, from your everyday citizen to public figures and companies, to create posts and content, to be active on the platform and to interact with other users. These platforms are also a main source of communication between companies and their target audiences. By conducting research, companies are able to utilize analytical information, such as the reach of their posts, to better understand the interactions between the users and their content. There are multiple underlying factors that will determine what shows up on a newsfeed or timeline. Algorithms for example, are a type of factor that can alter the reach of a post due to the way the algorithm is coded which can affect who sees your post and when. Other examples of factors that can impede the reach can include the time of which posts are made as well as how frequent the posts are between one another.  Reach on Facebook  Example of an analytic dashboard on Facebook that looks at the reach of a post. Facebook has their own analytic platform which allows the user to see how other users are interacting with their posts, with the use of multiple metrics. This is not something the average user uses, but rather a tool that is used by pages or public figures for example. For example, Facebook pages that represent a business often look at the activity their posts have generated. There are three types of reach that can be looked at on the Facebook analytic platform.  Types of reach  = Organic Reach = This type of reach regards the number of distinct users that have seen a specific post on their feed. Organic reach in other words is the number of people who have seen the post being analyzed on their Facebook newsfeed. Data gathered from this type of reach can give intel to those doing the analysis such as the demographics of those who have seen the post. = Paid Reach = This type of reach regards the number of times that distinct users have come across sponsored posts, ads or content. In other words, paid reach is the number of times Facebook users have seen a post that has been paid for by a company. Data collected can give insight, to advertisers or marketers for example, on the activity based around the reach of their post. = Viral Reach = This type of reach regards the number of views by distinct users on posts that have been commented on or shared by their friends on Facebook. In other words, viral reach looks at the number of people who have seen a post after a friend of theirs commented or shared the original post, therefore it showed on their timeline. Viral reach can be looked at in terms of a collective number of times that the post has been on individual user's timelines. Data collected from viral reach can be used in multiple ways, for example it can be used to analyze the type of content that gets shared or commented on and can be further used to compare to other posts.  Engaged users  This refers to the number of individual users whom have clicked and interacted with a post on Facebook.  Reach on Twitter  Twitter gives access to any of their users to analytics of their tweets as well as their followers. Their dashboard is user friendly, which allows anyone to take a look at the analytics behind their Twitter account. This open access is useful for both the average user as well as companies as it can provide a quick glance or general outlook of who has seen their tweets. The way that Twitter works is slightly different than the way Facebook in terms of the reach. On Twitter, especially for users with a higher profile, they are not only engaging with the people who follow them, but also with the followers of their own followers. The reach metric on Twitter looks at the quantity of Twitter users who have been engaged but also the number of users that follow them as well. This metric is useful to see the if the tweets/content being shared on Twitter are contributing to the growth of audience on this platform.  Reach on Instagram  Instagram gives their users access to their reach, in the Instagram Insights section. You can use Instagram insights to learn more about your account‚Äôs followers and performance. Reach indicates the total number of unique Instagram accounts that have seen your Instagram post or story. You can find this data by looking at each individual post insights.  Uses of reach  The reach can be a useful metric to analyze for marketers and advertisers. Social media is a platform that is used by marketers to directly target their intended audience with ease. These platforms not only allow marketers to get a better understanding of their audience, but also allow advertisers to insert their ads onto the timelines of specific users to later be able to conduct research to see the reach of their posts/content.  Analytics and reach  Social analytics looks at the data collected based on the interactions of users on social media platforms. A lot of information can be gathered which can provide intel based on user activities on social media. When looking into analytics in regards to social media, each company or group has a different goal in mind to engage their audience. At a glance, the three might seem as if they are very similar, however the differences between them are significant. There are many aspects that can be analyzed from the data gathered from social media platforms, depending what is being observed, the correct metric would then be selected to further analyze. One example of the many metrics that can be used through social analytics is the reach.

This mosque is the largest mosque in Koto Gadang area. Since its foundation in 1856, the mosque has undergone some form of transformation and several repairs. The earliest mosque, known as the Old Jamik Mosque, was typical of Minangkabau style with cone-shaped tapered roofs. However, the mosque was heavily damaged during the Padang Panjang earthquake in 1926. A few months after the earthquake, the new mosque was soon built by the initiative of Yahya Datuk Kayo, who was a member of the Volksraad representing Minangkabau, and inaugurated the renewed mosque on February 5, 1932. Designed by Yazid Rajo Mangkuto, the shape of the new mosque building was totally changed from its predecessor. However, the building of the mosque was destroyed again by the earthquake in March 2007. Since then the mosque was restored with the form similar to the pre-earthquake one.

There was also a tower on the roof. The roof had no dome, but consisted of several gonjong roof, a Minangkabau style roof, made of fibers. One gonjong in the middle was flanked by eight smaller gonjong around him. On June 28, 1926, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake hit Padangpanjang and caused damage to the walls of the mosque. Some of the walls collapsed and the parts still standing were cracked. Dreaded by danger, the building of the mosque was finally dismantled. In a meeting attended by a number of local community leaders on July 18, 1926, it was agreed to immediately establish a new mosque by forming a committee headed by Yahya Datuk Kayo.

The organization was guided by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) and created by Vilma Martinez. The project was headquartered in San Francisco and San Antonio.  About  The project was founded by Vilma Martinez, president of MALDEF and the first woman in the United States to lead a significant civil rights organization. Funding for the organization was provided by the Ford Foundation, and was separate from funds for MALDEF. The foundation wanted to fund projects with organizations they already supported. For the first year, the foundation offered CRP $25,000. Every year afterward, the CRP had to justify itself to the Ford Foundation in order to receive funding for the next year. CRP started its first litigation in 1975, focusing on employment, health care and prison reform. The organization won unemployment benefits for Head Start workers in Texas. It also won complaints against military bases and other organizations for discrimination in hiring and promoting Chicanas. For example, the CRP won a complaint against San Antonio's Comprehensive Employment Training Act in which they addressed issues regarding sexual discrimination in their hiring process. The CRP also won cases against doctors who were forcing Spanish-speaking women to consent to sterilization, often asking them while they were giving birth, or just before a Cesarean operation. In California, these patients were pressured with threats of exposure to immigration authorities for those who were illegal aliens and threats of welfare payments being cancelled if they did not sign over their right to sterilization. In another case handled by the CRP, Chicana women were being experimented on in San Antonio by being given placebo birth control pills without their consent or knowledge. The CRP also acted as a watchdog for the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA). Their first filing against CETA in 1976 caused the number of minorities and women in the program to rise from 20% to 50%. In 1976, the CRP branched out, filing an amicus brief on behalf of a black woman, Margaret Miller, who was fired for rejecting sexual harassment from her supervisor. CRP also represented Chicano men. CRP collected data on Chicana employment and educational discrimination. CRP used this data to show that Chicana women were discriminated against in different ways than Chicano men and white women in the United States. This research also revealed how legal rights were gendered and often ignored by the broader Chicano movement. CRP was also involved in educational outreach to Chicana women. This outreach included a series of pamphlets on topics such as women's health issues, immigrant rights and employment.  History  Martinez immediately began work on the CRP after she became MALDEF president in September 1973. Martinez hired a lawyer and former Congressional secretary, Patricia Vasquez, in June 1974 to run CRP. As the organization grew, the CRP set up a task force, in 1976, which would identify and prioritize legal cases. On the board of the task force were Francisca Flores, Pauline Jacobo, Teresa Aragon de Shepro, Carmen Carrillo, Drucilla Ramey, Elizabeth Waldman and Jean Fairfax. By the summer of 1978, in order to gain more grassroots support, the CRP began to collaborate with Comisi√≥n Femenil, the Chicana Service Action Center (CSAC), Mujeres Unidas and the Mexican American Women's National Association (MANA). In 1979, Vasquez resigned from CRP, saying she had \\"mixed feelings\\" about leaving and was resigning also because of \\"incompatible differences\\" between herself and Martinez. Carmen Estrada, who had been working in the CRP San Francisco office, took over Vasquez place as the head of CRP. When Martinez resigned from MALDEF in 1982, the project faltered without her leadership and support. In 1983, there was a lack of funds to continue the project and it ended.  Notable cases  * Lau v.

The conference marked the first time Mexican-American feminists came together within the state from around the country to discuss issues important to feminism and Chicana women. It was considered the first conference of its kind by the Corpus Christi Caller-Times.  About  The conference took place between May 28 and May 30, 1971 and was held at the Magnolia Park YWCA in Houston. It was held as part of the International Decade for Women. Chicana women faced three different kinds of discrimination: racism, classism and sexism. The conference was meant to address these issues. Prior to this national conference, regional groups had met to start planning for the bigger event. The head organizer was Elma Barrera. Other major organizers included Yolanda Garza Birdwell and Gloria Guardiola. Anglo women working at the YWCA helped plan and organize the event as well. During the planning, there been a miscommunication about places to stay for the conference and many women from outside of Houston were without a place to stay. There were over six hundred Chicana participants at the conference. People who came to the conference included members of the local community, activists, community organizers, students, various professionals and nuns. However, around 80 percent of the women were between the ages of 18 to 23 and were college and university students. Organizations attending the conference included La Raza Unida Party, labor unions, the Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO), and Las Hermanas. On the conference's first day, several workshops addressed gender issues, sexual liberation, family planning and ways in which women have been oppressed within the Chicano community. The first workshop discussed about the topic of sex, the second workshop focused on the topic of education, the third workshop discussed about marriage, and the fourth workshop covered the topic on religion. On the second day, topics relating to how Chicana women fit into a broader framework of women's liberation was discussed. There was a walkout on the third day of the conference. About half of the conference attendees left because they felt that the assembly should focus on racism instead of sexism. The group was angry that the conference was being held in a \\"Gringo\\" institution. The walkout started while Bertha Hernandez was speaking at the 3rd day's General Assembly. Those who walked out continued their own conference at a park nearby, where they created their own resolutions. Some of the workshops on day three were cancelled because of the walkout. Some of the women who attended the conference \\"felt that talking about a women's agenda was divisive to the movement, while others were disturbed by the presence of white women at the conference.\\" The walkout demonstrated \\"how Chicana feminism was in flux both nationally and regionally in the early stages of the Chicano/a Movement.\\" The women who called for the walkout contended \\"that Chicanas had no business holding the conference at the YWCA because it was run by gavachas.\\" Many of the women who attended the conference \\"were not involved with the planning of the conference because the women running it wanted no suggestions or criticism from anyone.\\" Also, many of the women did not like the workshops because \\"nothing was being accomplished, and most were getting off the subjects.\\" Anna NietoGomez categorized the walkout as \\"a conflict between Chicana feminists and loyalists.\\" Conference attendees had two sets of resolutions to review because of the split. It was intended that all attendees review these before the second Conferencia de Mujeres por La Raza. Individual communities would then be able to comment and a vote on the resolutions would be taken at the next conference in 1972.  Legacy  The conference raised the issue of feminism within the Chicano community. It led to the creation of resolutions from two of the largest workshops, \\"Sex and the Chicana\\" and \\"Marriage--Chicana Style\\" which addressed women's rights, access to birth control and abortions and for Chicana women to denounce machismo, discrimination in education, double standards for men and women and \\"the repressive ideology of the Catholic Church.\\" The conference \\"signaled the growth of a national political movement and potential political project of Chicana feminism.\\" Resolutions were also created regarding the importance of childcare centers. The Conference served as \\"a map of fractures, tensions, and the various centers of gravity in the emergence of a political project of Chicana feminism.\\" La Conferencia was the development of a strong group of Chicanas who were \\"providing leadership for their sisters.\\" After the conference the number of articles published about Chicana issues increased significantly. Barrera has continued to speak about her experience with the conference. The Lucy R. Moreno Collection at the University of Texas at Austin contains materials and clippings from the conference.

In August 2017, Refuse Fascism organizers identified themselves as anti-fascists but differentiated themselves from \\"Antifa\\". They also distinguished themselves from other groups opposed to Donald Trump such as the Indivisible movement, which engage in electoral politics. In January 2017, prior to Trump's inauguration, Refuse Fascism member Tedd Sirota argued that Trump exhibited fascist \\"character traits\\", and argued that the most dangerous aspect of Trump's presidency would be the alliance \\"between his unbridled capitalism and the Christian fascism of [Vice President] Mike Pence\\". The group advocates Trump's removal from office by constitutional methods (including the Twenty-fifth Amendment) and identifies the Arab Spring and the protests leading to the impeachment of former President of South Korea Park Geun-hye in March 2017 as evidence of the effectiveness of protests. Members share a disbelief in the ability of the Democratic Party's capacity to stop Trump and a commitment to direct action. Refuse Fascism member Raphael Kadaris said in July 2017: \\"There's a lot of people hoping that Democrats somehow intervene or one of these investigations. The idea we that we can rely on people in the FBI or Democratic party is a dangerous illusion.\\" Refuse Fascism spokesperson Sunsara Taylor said that the group opposed Trump and Pence because > Trump has openly promoted white supremacy, encouraged police brutality and > brought back mandatory sentencing. He has demonized and unleashed terror > against immigrants and torn thousands from their families. His Muslim ban is > largely in effect. Trump has threatened the courts and the press. The > Trump/Pence regime has muzzled scientists, accelerated the destruction of > the environment and threatened the world with nuclear annihilation. Pence > opposes abortion in all circumstances and would completely deny the rights > of LGBTQ people. Activities January‚ÄìOctober 2017 Refuse Fascism organizes non-violent protests. In January 2017 Refuse Fascism participated in the DisruptJ20 protests on the day of Trump's inauguration and the airport protests against Executive Order 13769, which suspended entry to the U.S. by nationals of seven countries. In July 2017, Refuse Fascism members were present at the Impeachment March events, which called for the U.S. Congress to begin the process of impeaching Trump. Also in July, Refuse Fascism organized demonstrations in several cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco. Kadaris expressed hope that these demonstrations would \\"create a legitimacy crisis\\" affecting Trump's presidency. In August 2017, following the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the Los Angeles branch of Refuse Fascism organized a march which began at Los Angeles City Hall. Refuse Fascism member Michelle Xi said the purpose of the demonstration was \\"to say, 'No, we're not going to normalize these Nazis and how they feel emboldened.'\\" Refuse Fascism groups also helped to organize a march to the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago on the same day, and organized a march to Trump Tower in New York City. Carl Dix, a member of Refuse Fascism, said the events in Charlottesville were a \\"direct outgrowth of the Trump/Pence fascist regime\\" and said \\"These fascists are serious. And we must wake up and confront them with resistance that is just as serious.\\" Refuse Fascism was involved in organizing several demonstrations in Berkeley, California in September 2017: a protest against a speech by the conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro at the University of California, Berkeley on September 12; a \\"March Against White Supremacy\\", which was addressed by Chelsea Manning, on September 23; and a demonstration against a planned \\"Free Speech Week\\" which involved a brief occupation of Wheeler Hall, on September 25. Also in September, Refuse Fascism‚ÄìHouston was one of several groups involved in organizing a protest in support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and in opposition to Trump's rescission of the program. In October 2017 Refuse Fascism members protested panelists at an event on civil discourse and hate speech at the University of California, Los Angeles. One member criticized panelists for normalizing Trump's presidency by discussing hate speech in the abstract. November 4, 2017 Protesters speak at a Refuse Fascism rally in Union Square, San Francisco, November 4, 2017. News media reported in September 2017 that Refuse Fascism was organizing a series of nonviolent protests against the Trump administration, which began on November 4, 2017. Conferences were held in Austin, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco in August 2017 in preparation for the protests. Protestors carrying signs reading \\"NOV 4 IT BEGINS\\" blocked traffic on U.S. Route 101, near Alameda Street in Los Angeles, on September 26, 2017. The road blockade and the planned protests became the subject of a conspiracy theory alleging that anti-fascist groups were planning to foment a civil war in the United States. In September and October 2017 the claims were reported in multiple articles and broadcasts by InfoWars, by the John Birch Society's publication The New American, and by Richard Spencer's Altright.com website. In October 2017, the conspiracy theorist Frank Gaffney and author and activist Trevor Loudon accused Refuse Fascism of inciting, or conspiring to incite, riots across state lines, and called for the federal government to intervene. Later in October, the conservative blog The Gateway Pundit published an article by Lucian Wintrich claiming an \\"antifa leader\\" had pledged to \\"behead white parents\\" on November 4. The article was shared on Facebook more than 40,000 times. Wintrich subsequently distanced himself from the article. Also in October 2017, rumors circulated claiming that the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) had scheduled a power outage for November 4; in fact, the DOD intends to conduct a training exercise alongside the American Radio Relay League, an event that has been held quarterly since 2013, in which the electrical grid will not be turned off. As of October 25, 2017, YouTube videos warning of plans for a civil war had been viewed millions of times; and as of November 2 a viral video entitled \\"Officer Warns: Antifa To Declare Civil War On Whites Before Year End\\" had been shared over 55,000 times on Facebook. The conspiracy theory has led to threats to attack the demonstrations and to murder anti- fascists. Taylor said of the claims: \\"What they're saying is completely false. They're blatant lies, and they're creating and intending to intimidate people who want to stand up to the Trump/Pence regime. It's concerning that these lies are being spread and that they're unleashing threats.\\" Taylor also said that the response \\"lets us know we've struck a chord, and they recognize the strength of what we are doing.\\" Spencer Sunshine of Political Research Associates argued in October 2017 that \\"the conspiracy is being used to encourage Far Right activists to harm non-violent Leftist protestors\\" and that \\"The organizing function of these 'looming war' narratives serves to motivate the Far Right base, rather than function as actual predictions.\\" Adi Robertson of The Verge wrote on November 3 that \\"It doesn't necessarily matter how much anyone believes tomorrow's nationwide protest is a civil war‚Äîthe point is that some people are hoping it will become one.\\" On November 4, 2017, Refuse Fascism held peaceful demonstrations in New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and other cities. 2020 In late September 2020, Refuse Fascism organized nationwide marches \\"Against Death, Lies and Fascism\\" as America neared 200,000 COVID-19 deaths.https://www.newsweek.com/trump-protests- covid-200000-deaths-1533216 See also * Protests against Donald Trump * By Any Means Necessary References Further reading * External links * 2016 establishments in the United States Anti-fascism in the United States Anti-fascist organizations in the United States Direct action Organizations established in 2016 Protests against Donald Trump Organizations based in New York City Revolutionary Communist Party, USA ","title":"Refuse Fascism"},{"id":"55219735","text":"St James, Trowbridge in 2016.

A return donation 171 years later ‚Äì from Massachusetts to Ireland ‚Äì has been described as repayment for the original aid. Background The Wampanoag Confederacy made early gains in the King Philip's War. In 1675, the King Philip's War erupted between the Wampanoag Confederacy and their allies, on the one hand, and the United Colonies of New England and their Mohegan and Pequot allies on the other. The destructive conflict saw rapid Wampanoag gains and bloody losses by the United Colonies who were largely refused military assistance both by the British government and by the neighboring colony of New York. By the spring of 1676 the frontier of Massachusetts had been overrun and lay \\"in shambles\\" with eleven towns ‚Äì including Dartmouth and Springfield ‚Äì entirely evacuated, and much of the population sheltered in a besieged Boston. The Donation In 1676 Nathaniel Mather ‚Äì a Lancashire-born, Harvard- educated, independent Protestant clergyman ‚Äì was ministering in Dublin. Mather organized a fundraising drive among Dubliners to send foodstuffs and other goods to Massachusetts Bay Colony. The resulting donation was loaded onto the hired ship Katherine which sailed from Dublin, en route to Boston, on August 28, 1676. Upon arrival, the consignment was to be given to a committee composed of William Tyng, James Oliver, and John Hull, \\"or as many of them as shall be alive\\". The committee was instructed to sell the goods to pay the shipping charges and distribute the remainder to colonists and members of colonial-allied Native American tribes who had been made refugees. Proceeds from the donation were ultimately divided among approximately 600 families. The United States sloop-of-war USS Jamestown (pictured) carried a return donation to Ireland in 1847. Massachusetts Donation of 1847 In 1847, during the Great Famine, Massachusetts businessmen organized a fundraising drive for distressed Irish families which collected $150,000 in goods. The donation, transported to Ireland aboard the U.S. Navy sloop-of-war was, according to captain Robert Bennett Forbes, \\"for the payment of an old debt\\" ‚Äì a reference to the Irish Donation of 1676. A second planned donation shipment, to be collected from citizens of New York and transported aboard the U.S. Navy frigate , saw less success; agitation by the ascendant, anti-Catholic Know Nothing movement had resulted in popular hostility to the idea of sending supplies to benefit the Irish. The shortfall in New York was made-up by additional provisions offered by Bostonians which ultimately enabled USS Macedonian to put to sea with a full cargo.

It enrolls 1,250 students from kindergarten through baccalaureate and houses 340 boarding students.  History   Coll√®ge du Faubourg Ceres (1874‚Äì1907)  = Foundation (1874‚Äì1875) = The Jesuit fathers came to Reims in April 1866 at the request of the Abel√© de Muller family, thanks to the intervention of Cardinal Gousset who obtained government authorization and the financial assistance of Baron de Sachs, to provide religious services for German- speaking families, especially Alsatians or Luxembourgers, who had come to Reims in large numbers in the preceding years. After the war of 1870, and in anticipation of the forthcoming closure of the Coll√®ge Saint-Clement of Metz, steps were taken for the construction of a College. Bishop Landriot proposed to the Jesuits to take back the diocesan college of Rethel in exchange for the new college. The Jesuits bought the farm Grulet, 86 Faubourg Ceres, on 27 June 1872, along with a few other buildings at number 80, 82, and 84 of the F√©rbourg Ceres and a neighbouring garden, the \\"Jardin Petit\\". The provincial of the order came to Reims on 8 August 1874 to make the final decisions, and the √âcole Libre Saint-Joseph opened its doors. Three classes were opened, fifth, sixth, and a preparatory course of seventh-eighth. In this first year 37 students were enrolled. Henri Mertian was rector and Fr. Hoffmann prefect. = Developmental period (1875‚Äì1880) = right In the second school year the number of pupils was 100 in five classes, and the following year 160 pupils in six classes. In 1875 Fr. Mertian became minister and Fr. Cornaille rector. Mertian conceived the general plan of the College and began construction in 1875 of the central building parallel to the Rue David. This building, built by the architect Collignon opened in 1877. Fr. Cornaille was leading the Coll√®ge from 1875 to 1880 and Fr. Lacouture from 1875 to 1886. Apart from three or four lay professors, all the staff were Jesuits. = First tests (1880‚Äì1889) = On 9 March 1880 a decree of Jules Ferry prohibited unauthorized congregations from teaching, particularly naming the Jesuits, and prescribed the expulsion of religious from their colleges. Father Rollin and Archbishop Langenieux declared that everything would be done to save the school and to maintain the teaching methods and principles of the Society of Jesus. The direction of the College was entrusted to canon Champenois, a former professor of philosophy at the Coll√®ge de Rethel; priests and religious people replaced the Jesuits. At the beginning of 1881, Fr. Didier-Laurent, of the diocese of Saint-Di√©, replaced the Canon Champenois as Superior of the College and held this office until 1889. In 1886, Fr. Poisat succeeded Lacouture as prefect. In 1889 a new building on the Faubourg Ceres (now avenue Jean-Jaures) was inaugurated to replace the temporary accommodations. = Return of the Jesuits (1889‚Äì1901) = In 1889, enrolment exceeded 300. Fr. Rousselin again became Rector in 1889. In October 1898, an annex of the College called \\"Small College of St, Stanislaus\\" was opened by the Jesuits, then, after their expulsion in 1901, led by Fr. Frezet. The classes were taught by the Brothers of Christian Instruction of Plo√´rmel, who had helped with this teaching since 1893. This \\"Small Coll√®ge\\" lasted until 1903. In 1900, Fr. Armand Poirier took over as rector. Due to the Law on Congregations 1901, the Jesuits were again obliged to leave the College. The Jesuits left the College in 1901 and in 1902 founded a College in Florennes, Belgium. The college, now √âcole Saint-Joseph, reopened in October 1901 and was led by Auguste Gindre. On 25 September 1904, the Brothers of Christian Instruction were expelled from their boarding school on the Rue de Venise. On 17 December 1906, Cardinal Lu√ßon was expelled from the Archdiocese, and all major and minor seminaries were closed: the tribunal had appointed a liquidator. The Civil Society, which administered the College financially, claimed the allocation of its property for its benefit. but its rights were contested by the liquidator. On 6 August 1907 a judgment of the Court of Appeal awarded the liquidator the building of the Faubourg Ceres and the country house on the road to Louvois, which were placed under sequestration. Former students hoped to buy the building of the Faubourg Ceres and, awaiting its adjudication, it was decided to resort for a year to temporary locations. The College was split into two: classes ten through twelve were installed under the direction of Fr. Charles in the buildings of an old free school in the parish of Saint-Jean- Baptiste on Flodoard street, placed at the College's disposal by Fr. B√©guin, the parish pastor; the boarders of these classes were housed in the former convent of Divine Providence, 33 Saint-Andr√© Street. At the instigation of the Alumni Committee a Society was set up, on the basis of an unassailable legality, to ensure the material life of the College, the \\"Soci√©t√© R√©moise Immobili√®re\\" and the Secondary Education Company, with capital of 140,000 francs paid by the shareholders. The founding meeting was held on 20 July 1908. An initial auction of the confiscated buildings had taken place on 7 April 1908; but the price of 250,000 francs for the property of the Faubourg Ceres appeared excessive to the Alumni Committee, and they declined the purchase. No other purchaser appeared and on 21 July 1908 the second auction found the city of Reims outbidding everyone; the building of the Faubourg Ceres was awarded to the city for 253,000 francs. The Company could only buy the furniture.  Saint-Joseph School, 37 Rue de Venise (1908‚Äì2001)  Entrance of Saint-Joseph de Reims building at 37 Rue de Venise, in 2010 = Before the First World War (1908‚Äì1914) = Not having been able to retrieve the building from the Faubourg Ceres, decisions had to be taken to ensure the opening of the College in October. The former boarding school of the Brothers in the Rue de Venise, on which Cr√©dit Foncier had a mortgage, had been vacant since 1904. Negotiations were begun in 1907 with Cr√©dit Foncier and, with the approval of the Superior General of the Brothers, a lease was signed on 27 August 1908. Renovations progressed quickly and the school opened on time at 37 Rue de Venise on 8 October 1908. Mr. Gindre was charged with the direction of the College. The teaching staff consisted of priests, ecclesiastics, and laymen, many of whom had already taught for several years at the Coll√®ge Faubourg Ceres. The College continued, going from 165 pupils in 1908 to 275 pupils in 1913. In 1913 the Board of Directors, to ensure stability for the College and fearing use the building as barracks under the three-year military law, proposed to the shareholders the purchase of the building at Cr√©dit Foncier. As with the lease, an approach was made to the Superior General of the Brothers, who gave his consent. An increase in the capital of the Society was covered by the alumni and friends of the College, and on 19 June 1913 the purchase was made. = During the First World War (1914‚Äì1918) = The mobilization of almost all professors and supervisors and, from September 1914, the bombing of the city interrupted the schooling. The buildings sheltered refugees from Belgium and Northern France. The war brought bombardments that severely damaged the buildings.Docteur Andr√© Jacquinet, Histoire du Coll√®ge Saint-Joseph de Reims 1874-1949, Les √âquipes, 1952 = Between the two wars (1919‚Äì1939) = In spite of damage, the buildings survived the war. Fr. Cotteau de Simencourt, Superior of the College, and members of the Board of Directors requested to be allowed a return to Reims and reopen the school there. This was declined by the Superior General. Repairs were carried out to ensure the reopening in October 1919. After that, the works continued with the chapel restored in 1920 and the completion of the kitchen, refectory and dormitories. In 1924, the house located at 27 Rue de Venise was bought. In May 1924 the blessing of the commemorative marble plaques for 245 teachers and ex-pupils who died in the Great War took place. In January 1929, the newsletter Le Sourire de Reims was created. The number of pupils rose to 518 in 1938. = During the Second World War (1939‚Äì1945) = The mobilization of September 1939 and the new World War were the next serious disturbance in the life of the College: Father Prefect, the bursar, and most of the masters were immediately mobilized. On September 9, seven-eighths of the College was requisitioned for overflow from St. Joseph Hospital. The year 1942 marked an important turning point in the College's history. In the previous years there had been a question of a renewal of the school structure, which no longer imposed the same regulations on students in the upper and lower classes. In October 1942 the students were organised in 12-person \\"teams\\". This meant less supervision and more personal responsibility. In 1944-1945, with no heating in the building on the Rue des Capucins, the classes were moved to the central building. = From the Liberation to the Centenary (1945‚Äì1974) = The development of the College was constant and gradual, from 576 in 1947 to 948 in 1974, necessitating an extension of the institution from the viewpoint of land and location. Nearby properties were purchased between 1953 and 1969, on Venice, Moulins, Capucins, l'Equerre, and Paul-Adam streets. Important construction was undertaken, in particular the First Division building and a large gymnasium. Due to the law of 8 July 1969, the Soci√©t√© Immobili√®re of the College decided to become an Association under the 1901 Act. cited at the Extraordinary General Meeting of 6 December 1972, under the name of \\"Association R√©moise Immobili√®re et d'Enseignement Secondaire\\", with Jean Harmel as its Chairman.

Built in 1938, and still in use housing federal offices, it is an enduring presence of the federal government in the city. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. Description and history The former United States Post Office and Custom House building is located at the southern end of downtown St. Albans, on the west side of South Main Street at its junction with Stebbins Street. It is a two-story L-shaped brick building with Colonial Revival styling. The main facade is nine bays wide, with a three-bay entrance area recessed behind a three-arch loggia. A narrow metal balcony runs above this loggia, with tall doubled windows above each arch. A band of Vermont marble runs below the eave, incised with the building identification. The former post office lobby space is adorned with murals painted by artist Philip von Saltza. The building was constructed for the federal government in 1938 as part of a New Deal-era jobs program. It was designed by Lorimer Rich, a private architect, working in conjunction with Louis Simon, the supervising architect of the United States Department of the Treasury, and was located along United States Route 7, long a major north-south route to Canada. Increased road development and automotive traffic prompted the government to expand both the number of border stations and customs facilities in the region. Customs offices were moved out of the building in the 1960s, and the post office was enlarged by an addition in 1967-68. The post office moved out in 2008; the building continues to house other federal government offices.

Background and synopsis The Gender Fairy is an Australian book aimed at helping transgender children and their families, inspired by Hirst's experiences as a mother to a transgender child. The book's story is described as \\"a tale of two children who are taking their first joyful steps toward living as their true selves\\". The book is aimed as an educational resource for children aged four and up and is designed to be read aloud at home or in the classroom. The book aims to reassure transgender children, saying \\"only you know whether you are a boy or a girl. No one can tell you.\\" The book contains notes for teachers and parents compiled by academic Roz Ward. The foreword is written by Dr Michelle Telfer from the Centre for Adolescent Health, Gender Service at the Royal Children's Hospital. Publishing and reception The book, promoted by the Safe Schools Coalition, was launched at St Kilda Primary School at an event attended by Victorian Minister for Equality Martin Foley who stated that \\"This book is about affirming trans children‚Äôs rights to be who they are, and if that means they‚Äôre happy, healthy, and engaged, and that their families are reconciled in support of that, that can only be a good thing.\\" The book has received widespread support from gender activists and some politicians. In November 2015, Senator Janet Rice, who was married to a transgender woman, praised the book in the Australian Senate. Criticism The book has been the subject of criticism from conservative political figures and organisations. The author estimated in 2018 that since its publication, The Gender Fairy had been mentioned in three different Australian political elections, as well as the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey. Lyle Shelton of the Australian Christian Lobby described the book's contents as 'contested gender theory' in a 2016 criticism of the Safe Schools program. The author has stated that the book is unrelated to the Safe Schools campaign, although it featured on the Safe Schools website. During the 2016 Australian federal election flyers criticising the education policies of the Australian Labor Party were distributed to voters attacking the book as \\"gender bending political correctness\\", which they linked to \\"Labor's plan for education.\\" In September 2017 the book featured in a television ad, released in conjunction with the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey for the \\"No\\" campaign. The ad incorporates the words, \\"Only you know whether you are a boy or a girl\\". Cory Bernardi, the leader of the Australian Conservatives party, subsequently mentioned The Gender Fairy in a robocall during the postal survey.

McBrown (1898-1989) was an American poet, playwright, educator, actress, and stage director. Although her career lasted well beyond the 1930s, she is sometimes grouped with writers of the Harlem Renaissance. Early life and education McBrown was born in 1898 in Charleston, South Carolina. Her father was a Methodist minister. As a child she heard a dramatic reading by actor Richard Berry Harrison, which sparked her interest in acting and public speaking. She studied under Florence H. Slack at the Curry School of Expression in Boston before enrolling in the Emerson College of Oratory in 1918. She was a member of the debating team and the Children's Theatre at Emerson, where she gained experience performing in and directing plays. She graduated in 1922 with a B.L.I. degree (Bachelor of Literary Interpretation). After graduation she taught English and dramatic arts for a year at Virginia State College. She then returned to Boston and pursued graduate studies at Boston University, receiving a Master of Education degree in 1926. While a student at Boston University, she was assistant coach of the dramatic club and taught in the Boston public schools. At this time she began writing children's poetry, which was published in the Saturday Evening Quill and Crisis magazine. She also headed the choral group and directed productions for the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Boston's South End. Career After receiving her M.Ed., McBrown moved to North Carolina, where she headed the drama department at Palmer Memorial Institute under the leadership of Charlotte Hawkins Brown. While at Palmer, McBrown's production of George V. Hobart's Experience earned a glowing review in Crisis magazine (August 1929). She then taught dramatic arts at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College, taking the place of Richard B. Harrison, who had left to take a lead role in a Broadway production. In the 1930s she moved to Washington, D.C., where she became prominent in literary and dramatic circles. She directed the Southeast Children's Theatre, the Bronze Masque of Freedmen's Training School, and the dramatic club of the Lambda Rho Society of the Asbury Methodist Episcopal Church. She worked as a speech teacher at the Washington Conservatory of Music, and as an English teacher at Frelinghuysen University, where university founder Anna Julia Cooper was serving as president. McBrown also opened her own studio. While in Washington she became increasingly interested in children's poetry and theater. In 1935 she published her first book of poetry, The Picture-Poetry Book, illustrated by Lois Mailou Jones. (McBrown and Jones collaborated on other occasions; for example, McBrown's poem, \\"Fire-Flies,\\" appears with an illustration by Jones in the Saturday Evening Quill.) McBrown's poetry (both children's poetry and poetry for adults) was published in various magazines and literary journals, including Opportunity, Popular Educator, International Poetry Magazine, Black Opals, Negro Women's World, and Phylon. She became managing editor of Parent-Teacher Magazine, and wrote feature stories for the Associated Negro Press. McBrown served for many years on the board of the Negro History Bulletin, edited by Carter G. Woodson. The Bulletin published her first two plays, both with historical themes. Bought With Cookies (1949) tells the story of a young Frederick Douglass; The Birthday Surprise (1953) is about Paul Laurence Dunbar. She earned national recognition for her one-woman shows, in which she often impersonated African- American heroines. She was also a noted storyteller, often donning resplendent African costumes to entertain children with tales from Africa. In the 1950s, McBrown moved to New York City to direct drama groups and teach speech at the Carnegie Hall Studio. She was a co-founder of the Carter G. Woodson Memorial Research Collection in the Jamaica branch of the Queens Library. She also wrote a column, \\"Proud Heritage,\\" for her neighborhood newspaper, Community Chatter. She traveled the world, continuing her education and sharing her knowledge with others. She studied at the Conservatoire Nationale de Musique et d'Art and took courses in drama and literature at the Institut Britannique in Paris. At the Royal Empire Society and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, she researched African folklore and culture. While traveling in Africa, she delighted audiences with performances of her stories. During the final years of her life, severe arthritis forced her to slow down. In 1970 she received Carter G. Woodson award from the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. She died in 1989.

History Edward Rawson, the Secretary of the Colony of Massachusetts is recorded as the first European settler of Caryville and North Bellingham in the mid-1600s who owned a farm in the area. The land was given to him as a land grant by the Massachusetts General Court in Boston as a form of compensation for his work. The land which became the village of Caryville was passed on as an 800 acre parcel to William Rawson, his heir, who broke up the land and sold it in 1701. Thomas Burch bought 200 acres of the land along the Country Road, an early name for the modern day Hartford Avenue through the center of Caryville. Burch sold the land to John Metcalf in 1735. Stephen Metcalf, his grandson sold the land to Joseph Fairbanks in 1800. As Bellingham took shape as a town, the community divided itself up into school districts. Caryville was included in the West Parish of Medway in 1747. Caryville emerged as a full fledged village beginning with the opening of the Caryville Mill in 1813 by Joseph Fairbanks. The site became the second active mill in Bellingham. Property rights were split between Metcalf and Fairbanks with provisions for a dam, a small water channel, a grist mill and a cotton mill. In 1830, William White purchased the Caryville mill. Upon his death, his widow remarried William H. Cary, the namesake of the village, who had moved to Medway from Attleboro to work in cotton mills in 1818. Cary rebuilt and enlarged the mill after a fire and constructed three tenement houses. Cary lived past the age of 80, owning the mill for 16 years. The residents of the small village named the post office after him when it was built in 1866. Electric streetcars began running between Milford, Caryville and Medway beginning in 1897, with electric lighting in the village by 1907. Throughout its history, Caryville was dominated by the Metcalf family. Edwin and William Fairbanks, the grandsons of Joseph Fairbanks, operated a shoe factory until it burned down in 1876. Caryville was a large and prosperous mill village that at one point in the 1800s petitioned to be set off as a separate town. Into the early 20th century, the village had an active baseball rivalry with the Dean College baseball team in the center of Franklin. Decline Caryville gradually faded as a defined village with the growth of suburbs in Bellingham and the construction of Interstate 495 in 1965. A large mill, dated to 1918, remained standing in Caryville until its demolition in 2016. Simultaneously, the Bellingham government ordered the removal of the small dam adjacent to the mill.

As a result of advanced computational power in recent decades, high frequency data can be accurately collected at an efficient rate for analysis.Ruey S. Tsay (2000) Editor's Introduction to Panel Discussion on Analysis of High-Frequency Data, Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, 18:2, 139-139, Largely used in financial analysis and in high frequency trading, high frequency data provides intraday observations that can be used to understand market behaviors, dynamics, and micro-structures.Andersen, T. G. (2000). Some reflections on analysis of high-frequency data. Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, 18(2), 146-153. High frequency data collections were originally formulated by massing tick-by-tick market data, by which each single 'event' (transaction, quote, price movement, etc.) is characterized by a 'tick', or one logical unit of information. Due to the large amounts of ticks in a single day, high frequency data collections generally contain a large amount of data, allowing high statistical precision.Dacorogna, M. M. (2001). An introduction to high-frequency finance. San Diego: Academic Press. High frequency observations across one day of a liquid market can equal the amount of daily data collected in 30 years. Use Data collected at high frequencies inform and update stock statistics in real-time Due to the introduction of electronic forms of trading and Internet-based data providers, high frequency data has become much more accessible and can allow one to follow price formation in real-time. This has resulted in a large new area of research in the high frequency data field, where academics and researchers use the characteristics of high frequency data to develop adequate models for predicting future market movements and risks. Model predictions cover a wide range of market behaviors including volume, volatility, price movement, and placement optimization.Hautsch, N., & SpringerLink (Online service). (2012;2011;). Econometrics of financial high- frequency data (2012th ed.). Heidelberg;Berlin;: Springer. There is an ongoing interest in both regulatory agencies and academia surrounding transaction data and limit order book data, of which greater implications of trade and market behaviors as well as market outcomes and dynamics can be assessed using high frequency data models. Regulatory agencies take a large interest in these models due to the fact that liquidity and price risks are not fully understood in terms of newer forms of automated trading applications. High frequency data studies contain value in their ability to trace irregular market activities over a period of time. This information allows a better understanding of price and trading activity and behavior. Due to the importance of timing in market events, high frequency data requires analysis using point processes, which depend on observations and history to characterize random occurrences of events. This understanding was first developed by 2003 Nobel Prize in Economics winner Robert Fry Engle III, who specializes in developing financial econometric analysis methods using financial data and point processes. High frequency data forms High frequency data are primarily used in financial research and stock market analysis. Whenever a trade, quote, or electronic order is processed, the relating data are collected and entered in a time-series format. As such, high frequency data are often referred to as transaction data. There are five broad levels of high frequency data that are obtained and used in market research and analysis: Trade data Individual trade data collected at a certain interval within a time series. There are two main variables to describe a single point of trade data: the time of the transaction, and a vector known as a 'mark', which characterizes the details of the transaction event. Trade and quote data Data collected details both trades and quotes, including price changes and direction, time stamps, and volume. Such information can be found at the TAQ (Trade and Quote) database operated by the NYSE. Where trade data details the exchange of a transaction itself, quote data details the optimal trading conditions for a given exchange. This information can indicate halts in exchanges and both opening and closing quotes.Brownlees, C. T., & Gallo, G. M. (2006). Financial econometric analysis at ultra-high frequency: Data handling concerns. Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, 51(4), 2232-2245. Fixed level order book data Using systems that have been completely computerized, the depth of the market can be assessed using limit order activities that occur in the background of a given market. Messages on all limit order activities This data level displays the full information surrounding limit order activities, and can create a reproduction of the trade flow at any given time using information on time stamps, cancellations, and buyer/seller identification. Data on order book snapshots Snapshots of the order book activities can be recorded on equi-distant based grids to limit the need to reproduce the order book. This however limits trade analysis ability, and is therefore more useful in understanding dynamics rather than book and trading interaction. Properties in financial analysis In financial analysis, high frequency data can be organized in differing time scales from minutes to years. As high frequency data comes in a largely dis- aggregated form over a time-series compared to lower frequency methods of data collection, it contains various unique characteristics that alter the way the data are understood and analyzed. Robert Fry Engle III categorizes these distinct characteristics as irregular temporal spacing, discreteness, diurnal patterns, and temporal dependence.R. Russell, Jeffrey & F. Engle, Robert. (2010). Analysis of High-Frequency Data. Handbook of Financial Econometrics, Vol 1. 383-426. 10.1016/B978-0-444-50897-3.50010-9. High frequency data plotted over time on the FTSE 100 index chart Irregular temporal spacing High frequency data employs the collection of a large sum of data over a time series, and as such the frequency of single data collection tends to be spaced out in irregular patterns over time. This is especially clear in financial market analysis, where transactions may occur in sequence, or after a prolonged period of inactivity. Discreteness High frequency data largely incorporates pricing and transactions, of which institutional rules prevent from drastically rising or falling within a short period of time. This results in data changes based on the measure of one tick. This lessened ability to fluctuate makes the data more discrete in its use, such as in stock market exchange, where popular stocks tend to stay within 5 ticks of movement. Due to the level of discreteness of high frequency data, there tends to be high level of kurtosis present in the set. Diurnal patterns Analysis first made by Engle and Russel in 1998 notes that high frequency data follows a diurnal pattern, with the duration between trades being smallest at the open and the close of the market. Some foreign markets, which operate 24 hours a day, still display a diurnal pattern based on the time of the day. Temporal dependence Due largely to discreteness in prices, high frequency data are temporally dependent. The spread forced by small tick differences in buying and selling prices creates a trend that pushes the price in a particular direction. Similarly, the duration and transaction rates between trades tend to cluster, denoting dependence on the temporal changes of price. Ultra-High frequency data In an observation noted by Robert Fry Engle III, the availability of higher frequencies of data over time incited movement from years, to months, to intraday collections of financial data. This movement however is not infinite in moving to higher frequencies, but faces a limit when all transactions are eventually recorded.Engle, R. F. (2000). The econometrics of ultra-high-frequency data. Econometrica, 68(1), 1-22. Engle coined this limiting frequency level as ultra-high frequency data. An outstanding quality of this maximum frequency is extreme irregularly spaced data, due to the large spread of time that a dis-aggregated collection imposes. Rather than breaking the sequence of ultra-high frequency data by time intervals, which would essentially cause a loss of data and make the set a lower frequency, methods and models such as the autoregressive conditional duration model can be used to consider varying waiting times between data collection. Effective handling of ultra-high frequency data can be used to increase accuracy of econometric analyses. This can be accomplished with two processes: data cleaning and data management. Data cleaning Data cleaning, or data cleansing, is the process of utilizing algorithmic functions to remove unnecessary, irrelevant, and incorrect data from high frequency data sets. Ultra-high frequency data analysis requires a clean sample of records to be useful for study. As velocities in ultra-high frequency collection increase, more errors and irrelevant data are likely to be identified in the collection. Errors that occur can be attributed to human error, both intentional (e.g. 'dummy' quotes) and unintentional (e.g. typing mistake), or computer error, which occur with technical failures.Verousis, T., & Ap Gwilym, O. (2010). An improved algorithm for cleaning ultra high-frequency data. Journal of Derivatives & Hedge Funds, 15(4), 323-340. Data management Data Management refers to the process of selecting a specific time-series of interest within a set of ultra-high frequency data to be pulled and organized for the purpose of an analysis. Various transactions may be reported at the same time and at different price levels, and econometric models generally require one observation at each time stamp, necessitating some form of data aggregation for proper analysis. Data management efforts can be effective to remedy ultra-high frequency data characteristics including irregular spacing, bid-ask bounce, and market opening and closing. Alternate uses outside of financial trading A study published in the Freshwater Biology journal focusing on episodic weather effects on lakes highlights the use of high frequency data to further understand meteorological drivers and the consequences of \\"events\\", or sudden changes to physical, chemical, and biological parameters of a lake.JENNINGS, E., JONES, S., ARVOLA, L., STAEHR, P. A., GAISER, E., JONES, I. D., Teknisk-naturvetenskapliga vetenskapsomr√•det. (2012). Effects of weather‚Äêrelated episodic events in lakes: An analysis based on high‚Äêfrequency data. Freshwater Biology, 57(3), 589-601. Due to advances in data collection technology and human networks coupled with the placement of high frequency monitoring stations at a variety of lake types, these events can be more effectively explored. The use of high frequency data in these studies is noted to be an important factor in allowing analyses of rapidly occurring weather changes at lakes, such as wind speed and rainfall, increasing understandings of lake capacities to handle events in the wake of increasing storm severity and climate change. High frequency data has been found to be useful in the forecasting of inflation. A study by Michele Mondugno in the International Journal of Forecasting indicates that use of daily and monthly data at a high frequency have generally improved the forecast accuracy of total CPI inflation in the United States.Modugno, M. (2013). Now-casting inflation using high frequency data. International Journal of Forecasting, 29(4), 664-675. The study utilized a comparison of lower frequency models with one that considered all variables at a high frequency. It was ultimately found that the increased accuracy of both highly volatile transport and energy components of prices in the high frequency inflation model led to greater performance and more accurate results. The use of half- life estimation to evaluate speeds of mean reversion in economic and financial variables has faced issues in regards to sampling, as a half-life of about 13.53 years would require 147 years of annual data according to early AR process models.Huang, M., Liao, S., & Lin, K. (2015). Augmented Half‚ÄêLife estimation based on High‚ÄêFrequency data. Journal of Forecasting, 34(7), 523-532. As a result, some scholars have utilized high frequency data to estimate half-life annual data. While use of high frequency data can face some limitations to discovering true half-life, mainly through the bias of an estimator, utilizing a high frequency ARMA model has been found to consistently and effectively estimate half-life with long annual data.

History  Mount Dumaresq was named by explorer Allan Cunningham on 8 June 1827, probably after road engineer William John Dumaresq, the brother-in-law of the New South Wales Governor Ralph Darling.leftIn about 1864 Rev. J.B. Watkin, a Wesleyan, commenced services in private homes in the area. On 2 January 1865, a public meeting was held to erect a chapel for regular services. James and Charles G. Wilson donated the land on their property adjacent to the main Freestone Road. On Sunday 4 February 1866, the first service was held in the new chapel, a wooden building at a cost of ¬£64 4s 1d of which ¬£50 was already promised. Much of the labour for the building was donated. Later the church was relocated on the Wilson's property to its present location (165 Freestone Road, ) where it was enlarged to be . Following the amalgamation of the Methodist Church into the Uniting Church in Australia in the 1970s, it became the Freestone Uniting Church.

Although not entirely completed, it opened for its first service on Sunday 4 September 1898. The church was at 185 Paynes Road (). Seven years later, the \\"new\\" church was dedicated to St Luke by the Anglican Bishop of Brisbane St Clair Donaldson on 1 November 1905. Due to a dwindling and ageing population, the last service was held at St Luke's on 31 March 2018 (Easter Saturday) and it was deconsecrated on 7 July 2018 by Bishop Cameron Venables.

In 2016, Newsweek called the Lunada Bay Boys \\"America's most notorious surf gang\\".http://www.newsweek.com/lunada-bay-boys-surfing-gang-480473 The group's territorialism of the Lunada Bay public beach has caused controversy in the legal and surfing worlds. Although the Bay Boys are now often considered a gang, the group had non-violent beginnings in the 1960s as a self-described surfing \\"family\\" or fraternity. History Historically Lunada Bay had been considered an acclaimed big wave winter surf spot, with a right-hand break. The culture of Palos Verdes surfing clubs extends back as far the 1930s with groups such as the Palos Verdes Surfing Club. The Lunada Bay Boys started in the 1960s as a fraternity of local surfers in the Palos Verdes region. An anonymous member stated, \\"It was more like a big family. I wouldn‚Äôt call it a gang. We used to camp down there every other night. We would almost live down there.\\" The group wasn't known for its localism during the 1960s, and surfers within the group were not as prone to violence. At the time, the Lunada Bay Boys wasn't the only surf crew in the city and neighbored the \\"Portuguese Bend crew\\" (Portuguese Bend Club) as well as the \\"Haggerty's crew\\" (Haggerty's Surfing Club) of their respective surf spots. Around the time, localism of surf spots was considered common sense due to outside surfers often causing boards to fall in the rocks due to lack of leashes at the time. Big wave surfing pioneer Greg Noll as well as U.S. champion Mike Purpus of Redondo Beach would surf with the Bay Boys in Lunada Bay during this era. The acclaim of Lunada Bay as a surf spot led to the creation of Lunada Bay Wetsuits in the late '60s. Mike Purpus and surfers Dewey Weber, Collie Ragland, Don Craig, and Donald Takayama would model for these Lunada Bay Wetsuits ads. Around this time, members would hang out on a rock ledge, however in the late 60s, a stone balcony was created on the shoreline of Lunada Bay, as a hangout for local surfers (often referred to as their \\"fort\\"). The \\"fort\\" was destroyed by State of California employees in 2016 partly in response to a lawsuit directed against the Bay Boys organization. In the 1970s a leadership shift happened in which older members moved away, and newer members surfaced into leadership. Older members of the group were stated to have \\"kept it safe and sane\\", whereas the newer leadership began to hassle outsiders more directly. A surfer at Lunada Bay expressed that the reason violence escalated in years after was because the younger generation sought to show devotion to the territory in the presence of veteran members. Culture In the 1960s the Lunada Bay Boys culture was mostly nonviolent and held close alliances with the neighboring Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach. Activities of the original generation included camping down at the beach, fishing, diving, or shaping their surf boards in their shops. Becoming a member of the group was more relaxed and involved no more than to be a local. One local told Stab magazine that approximately one quarter to one half of local surfers in Lunada Bay are members of the Lunada Bay Boys. Common acts of localism include hassling people, intimidation, vandalizing vehicles, slashing tires, throwing rocks, and inciting violence against non-locals. A surfer at Lunada Bay expressed his feelings on localism stating, \\"If we let every nice guy surf, there‚Äôd be a hundred guys out here. You have to nip it in the bud. The reason it‚Äôs not crowded is that people protect it. It‚Äôs fucked, dude. People think we‚Äôre a bunch of assholes, but you know what? We want to keep it like this so we can go somewhere where it‚Äôs fucking sacred.\\" Legality and lawsuits The Palos Verdes Estates Police Department has been criticized for not taking effective legal action against the Lunada Bay Boys, with the LA Times reporting that \\"city leaders repeatedly downplayed the alleged harassment by the Bay Boys against other surfers at Lunada Bay\\". Palos Verdes Estates Police Chief Jeff Kepley has acknowledged that officers in his department \\"may have relationships with surfers accused of tormenting outsiders.\\" In March 2016, surfer Diana Milena Reed and her lawyer sought an injunction against alleged members of the Lunada Bay Boys, to keep them from surfing at Lunada Bay. This lawsuit included claims of sexual harassment. The defendants denied Reed's allegations. Defendant Frank Ponce stated the claims were \\"ridiculous\\" and that \\"there are no Bay Boys\\".

One aircraft participated in December 2015 edition of the US Air Force's Operation Christmas Drop in the Pacific, along with one RAAF C-130J and three US C-130s. The JASDF and RAAF also participated in the 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 operations. In January 2020 two squadron C-130s and around 80 SDF personnel flew to Australia during the unprecedented 2019‚Äì20 Australian bushfire season. They flew to RAAF Base Richmond and were expected to be deployed across New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia as necessary. Afghanistan and Iraq Almost half of Japan's C-130s were used in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the US-led campaign against Afghanistan. While not participating in Afghanistan directly they provided support by flying US equipment and personnel to Singapore, Guam and other places. This freed up US resources to focus on the war in Afghanistan. Squadron C-130s were active in Iraq from 2004 to 2008. The provided support to the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force contingent deployed there after the invasion. Military exercises KC-130H Aerial refueling Demonstration (2016) Japan has taken place in the Cobra Gold military exercise in Thailand since 2005. In February 2017 a squadron C-130 was used in a drill for evacuating Japanese and US citizens ending with a short flight. In March 2012, a year after the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) had assisted Japan following the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, one of the squadron's aircraft visited RAAF Base Richmond in Australia. The squadron has participated in the Cope North military exercise on a number of occasions, including in 2009, 2013, 2016 and 2017. In-flight refuelling From 2010 two of the squadron's C-130Hs (95-1080 and 95-1083) have been equipped with aerial fuel-receiving and refueling functions, making them of KC-130H standard. This provides the JASDF with the ability to refuel the UH-60J search and rescue helicopters of its Air Rescue Wing. Other missions Typhoon Haiyan relief operations (2013) In response to Typhoon Haiyan hitting the Philippines in November 2013 squadron C-130s were deployed, along with other SDF aircraft. Yoshida, Reiji Massive SDF dispatch set for Philippine relief mission November 14, 2013 Japan Times Retrieved September 18, 2017 After the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in March 2014 two of the squadron's aircraft were sent to Subang Airport in Malaysia to assist in the search. In January 2016 after North Korea claimed to have exploded a hydrogen bomb, a squadron C-130, along with three Kawasaki T-4 aircraft, were used to test for radioactive particles. The flights were done for around 14 days. The flights did not detect any radioactive particles.

From 2009 to 2015, she held a teaching post at Oranim College. Orbach authored The Spirit of Matter (Orbach & Galkin, 1997), a handbook for therapists, artists, and educators, that details a hundred art exercises as part of a six-stage journey. Each exercise is thoroughly examined from technical, social and emotional aspects. Excavating the Blueprint. p. 168. An English translation of the book was published electronically in 2016. The Spirit of Matter. in Amazon. In discussing her work as a conceptual artist, Orbach compares herself to an archaeologist. In the late 1990s she created a conceptual \\"archaeological\\" website called Tel- Nona (\\"Nona mound\\", the Hebrew name echoing an archeological mound). According to Orbach, the site is where she mentally and spiritually digs for discoveries: she is simultaneously the mound being dug, the digger, the methods, and the findings. Orbach invented a character called Mound Hacker, who leaves ostraca at archeological sites and maps them on Google Earth. Each ostracon on Google Earth links to her blog, which is dedicated primarily to the loss of the Great Library of Alexandria. Using various metaphorical devices, the blog offers a commentary on how humanity develops massive bodies of knowledge and easily loses them. Orbach's Mound Hacker blog In 2012, Orbach started a blog titled Blog as Artwork. Blog as artwork In 2013, she was a keynote speaker at the Permissions and Inspirations, University of Haifa. In 1991, Orbach presented a joint exhibition with artist Gaia Tchetchik at the Arsuf gallery in Rishpon, titled \\"Communicating Vessels\\" and consisting of about thirty works. For the exhibition's conceptual and physical format, Orbach chose bowls, an object that carries both personal and cultural iconographies. Rather than clay, the bowl sculptures were made of curved two- dimensional paper. \\"Tel Nona\\" (2001), The National Maritime Museum, p. 58. Haifa (Catalog) Orbach and Tchetchik's 1992 exhibition \\"Chariot Sculptures\\", at the Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art, featured about forty Roman chariot sculptures, variously elaborated. The following year, Orbach and Tchetchik presented about twenty of these at the Grand Palais in Paris. The sculptures dealt with the complex relationships between the image of a winged female charioteer, made of paper in a variety of techniques, and her chariot, made of iron. \\"Tel Nona\\" (2001), The National Maritime Museum, p. 57. Haifa (Catalog) In her 1998 exhibition \\"Restless Torso\\" at the New Art Gallery in Kiryat Tivon, Orbach presented two collections : paper drawings from the series '1000 Drawings', and plaster reliefs of fossils from the series 'Fossils'. Using pencils, oil pastels, and collage, Orbach juxtaposed different forms of drawing, such as prehistoric cave paintings covered with archaeological layers. The fossils were made of plaster and pigments embedded with scraps of metal, wood, and bone. Some were placed in wooden boxes, supposedly for safekeeping, as if rare specimens in a natural history museum; while others were placed in glass cases set on the gallery walls. \\"Tel Nona\\" (2001), The National Maritime Museum, p. 54-56. Haifa (Catalog) For the 2001 exhibition \\"Tel Nona\\" at the Israeli National Maritime Museum in Haifa, Orbach created a faux archaeological site, based on items she had collected over the years. These formed the artist's interpretation of archaeological statuettes from the Chalcolithic and Canaanite cultures. With minimal modification, everyday off- the-shelf items were turned into \\"ancient\\" archaeological artifacts. Part of the exhibition, \\"Large Remains\\", included monumental floor-standing wall sculptures made of plaster and pigments, installed on wire mesh and iron frames. A further slide installations called \\"Pit of Memory and Oblivion\\" featured photographs of holes dug on the beach, projected as light circles from the ceiling onto the floor, in a wide, dark space. \\"Tel Nona\\" (2001), The National Maritime Museum, p. 56.

One consisted of paper drawings from the \\"1000 Drawings\\" series: using pencils and oil chalks on little square pieces of paper, Orbach had sketched a collection of images : a leaf, a table, a fish, a cypress tree, a wheel ‚Äì all simulating human torsos. The second part featured narrow wooden strips hanging on a hedge. The third part was an element borrowed from the \\"Tel Nona\\" (2001) 'Large Remains' series a sarcophagus-shaped boat, made of a plastered iron-and-netting framework, resting on a window. 2004, Hedge, Tove Osman Gallery, Tel Aviv (booklet).

Rivka Bakalash: \\"The title of Nona Orbach's \\"happening\\" is derived from an artistic dialogue with the notion of \\"Readymade\\" coined by Marcel Duchamp. Orbach challenges the distinction between reality and fiction, archaic and contemporary, a museum exhibit and a found object, \\"high art\\" and \\"low art,\\" in keeping with Duchamp's ideas. From the ashes Orbach creates the substances of life. Like the phoenix that rises from the ashes. She affixes wings to the potsherd, returning it to the here-and-now. By inviting the audience to revive the virtual and metaphorical \\"Ancient Library of Alexandria\\" in her website, she synthesizes, via a near-alchemical formula, the personal-perishable with the eternal human tissue. Nona moves from the personal mound, Tel Nona, to the collective Tel (mound)‚Äîthe archaeological finds, and back to personal objects which carry memory and meaning.\\" Rivka Bakalash, Ready and Made: Tel Nona, Audience Version.

Durham, later Hoy (January 17, 1815 ‚Äì July 30, 1901) was an American composer and hymn writer. She is remembered for her shape note tune \\"Promised Land\\", first published in 1835. Biography A native of Spartanburg County, South Carolina, Durham was the daughter of George Durham and Susan Hyde. She married Andrew Coan Hoy (1819‚Äì1890) in 1843; the ceremony was conducted by John Gill Landrum, who like her was a contributor to William Walker's Southern Harmony. She worked as a singing teacher, and in addition produced Baptist articles and tracts; these, though serious, displayed traces of wit as well. Durham moved to Cobb County, Georgia after the American Civil War, dying there and being buried in the Fowler-Hoy family cemetery. Two children, nine grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren survived her. She had outlived her husband by nearly eleven years. It has been posited that Durham was personally acquainted with Walker, who moved to the Spartanburg area around 1830; between 1835 and 1846 she contributed several tunes to his books.

He is a professor at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, the Texas A&M; College of Medicine, and the University of Texas Dell Medical School. He was Medical Director of the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation from 1989 to 1996. He has authored or co-authored over 300 publications and abstracts, and 16 professional books. Reid graduated with a B.A. in psychology in 1966 and completed his M.D. medical degree in 1970, both at the University of Minnesota. He undertook a psychiatric residency at the University of California, Davis, between 1970 and 1975, interrupted for military service. He then obtained a Master of Public Health (M.P.H) qualification from the University of California, Berkeley in 1975. For the 2015 trial of James Holmes for the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting, Reid reported around 300 hours of preparation and conducted 22 hours of interviews which were shown in their entirety to the jury. He reportedly was paid half a million dollars. He apparently almost caused a mistrial by immediately opining that Holmes met the legal standard of sanity. The BBC in 2017 reported that Reid had told them the shooting \\"was completely unrelated to the medication. For me, it was a result of mental illness.\\" In 2005 Reid supported psychiatrist Park Dietz over false testimony that had contributed to a guilty verdict and a possible execution of Andrea Yates. Dietz had testified that Yates got the idea of drowning children and claiming postpartum psychosis from a recent episode of Law and Order, a TV show Dietz had consulted on, but later admitted such an episode didn't exist and that Yates hadn't told him she watched the show. Reid called it an 'accident' and 'off-the-cuff answer' that shouldn't affect Dietz's credibility, blaming the prosecutor for exploiting it. In 2001 Reid reported on statistics resulting from a law in Texas that all deaths within two weeks of Electroconvulsive therapy be reported to the department of mental health and retardation; the article concluded that \\"The mortality rate associated with ECT (less than two per 100,000 treatments) in Texas is extremely low\\" and opposed the reporting of deaths within two weeks. A 2010 British study reported the Reid article as concluding that suicides after ECT were unrelated to the ECT, but were themselves \\"unable to determine whether ECT suicides occurred due to relapse or to the receipt of ECT\\". In 1999 Reid published an informal survey of psychiatrists who had personally, or knew of relatives who had personally, undergone electroconvulsive therapy. Reid reported in abstract that based on the psychiatrists' informal perceptions, \\"Almost all patients had moderate to excellent improvement\\" while clarifying in the full text that this was \\"sometimes with lasting relief\\". Reid alleged that later limited availability of ECT contributed to two suicides. In 1998 Reid, along with an economist from Novartis pharmaceutical company, reported a significantly lower rate of suicides in patients prescribed clozapine. Yale professor of psychiatry MIchael Sernyak and others have critiqued the statistical comparison for excluding suicides by people who had discontinued clozapine, a factor potentially linked to suicide, as well as not systematically establishing the basic demographic equivalence of the groups.

Unlike mammal teeth, individual dinosaur teeth are generally not considered by paleontologists to be diagnostic to the genus or species level for unknown taxa, due morphological convergence and variability between teeth. and many historically named tooth taxa like Paronychodon and Richardoestesia are today considered nomina dubia, and are used as form taxa to refer to isolated teeth from other localities displaced considerably in time and space from the type specimens. However, it is possible to refer isolated teeth to known taxa provided that the tooth morphology is known and the teeth originate from a similar time and place. Some of the most important anatomical information about dinosaur teeth is collected from polished, microscopically thin sections (histology), including the types of dental tissues present, tooth wear, tooth replacement patterns, how the teeth are attached, and the frequency of replacement. The actual material comprising a dinosaur tooth is not very different to teeth in modern animals. Most significant differences are in how the teeth fit together and continually regrew, with some examples shedding old teeth and others reabsorbing old teeth as they would grind down under chewing throughout a dinosaurs life.  Background  Bone histology of the non-avian dinosaur Shuvuuia and the early bird Confuciusornis The use of histology in paleontology has traditionally been more focused on examining long bones such as the femur or the humerus. Previous work on long bone histology revealed differences in the growth patterns of polar dinosaurs, identified a case of dwarfism in Europasaurus, reconstructed the life history of Dysalotosaurus by examining multiple specimens of different ontogenetic stages, and suggested that Psittacosaurus underwent a postural change from a quadruped to biped as it matured. By contrast, dental histology has not been looked at in great detail in dinosaurs until more recently and there has been an increase in interest in this particular sub-field. Histology studies traditionally rely upon the destructive process of creating and examining thin sections under microscopy, often restricting studies to taxa that have plentiful specimens such as isolated teeth or damaged specimens. While non-destructive means of analysis are sometimes possible through the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or micro computed tomography, much anatomical information is difficult to obtain without creating thin sections.  Histology  Histological study is microscopic examination, essential to revealing the most important aspects of dinosaur dental anatomy.  Selection  Different specimens will be suitable for looking at particular anatomical features. For example, specimens with teeth intact within the jaws are necessary to study tooth attachment as this information is lost on isolated teeth. On the other hand, isolated teeth would be sufficient if the goal is to examine wear on the tooth surface.  Embedding and sectioning  Thin sections are prepared by first embedding a suitable specimen in epoxy resin. The embedded specimen can then be mounted and cut with a precision saw. The resulting slice is attached to a slide and ground down, then polished, until it is thin enough, with a suitable surface to be examined with a microscope.  Examination  Thin sections are typically examined with a petrographic microscope using plain light and cross-polarized light. Some structures are more easily visible and distinct using one type of light over the other due to differences in their mineral properties. Some specimens can also be examined with a SEM.  Dental anatomy  Cross section of a typical theropod dinosaur tooth in side view. All dinosaur teeth possess the same tissue types but can differ in their appearance. Various major groups of dinosaurs have been examined through histology, these include the carnivorous theropods and herbivorous groups such as the sauropods, hadrosaurs and ceratopsians. Listed below are some of the dental anatomy that has been identified through histology and interpretations on their significance.  Tissue types  There are generally 5 tissue types present in dinosaurs, and these have been found to be identical to those of their closest living non-avian relatives, the crocodilians. One of the most significant findings is that despite differences in their appearance, dinosaur teeth are essentially composed of the same dental tissues found in modern mammals, crocodilians and other amniotes, suggesting that these tissues first evolved in a common ancestor and has been retained ever since. # Enamel - This is the hard coating on the outside of the teeth and typically appears as a clear, thin featureless band on the tooth surface when viewed in cross section. SEM analysis of the surface of dinosaur teeth revealed that their enamel form in prisms similar to mammals and that there is sufficient difference in the enamel microstructure to help pinpoint what group a tooth belonged to, sometimes to the genus level, when only isolated teeth are found. All teeth are not covered by a prismatic enamel, and in most taxa, prisms are perpendicular to the outer surface of the tooth. Complex arrangements such as visible in mammals are rare. Diagenetic alterations modify the structure and composition of both enamel and dentin. # Dentine - This tissue makes up the bulk of the tooth and is characterized by long thin parallel tubules running throughout the body of the tooth. # Cementum - This tissues covers the root of a teeth and is an attachment tissue that forms part of the periodontium. It is typically infilled with Sharpey's fibers that help anchor the tooth in place in the socket. # Periodontal ligament - This is a soft tissue layer between the cementum and the tooth socket. While this is not preserved in fossils, there is always a mineral filled gap that is present in all dinosaur teeth between the cementum and the tooth socket, which infers the presence of soft tissue in life. # Alveolar bone - This is a type of bone that is typically spongy in appearance and forms the tooth socket itself. Top down view of a replacement tooth in Coelophysis growing up through the middle of pulp cavity in the older tooth.  Growth  In some examples viewed in cross section, growth lines can be observed in the dentine of dinosaur teeth. These are known as lines of von Ebner and represent daily deposition of dentine. Counting these lines provides the age of a tooth and comparing the age of the mature tooth to the replacement tooth in a socket provides an estimate of the tooth replacement rate. The difference in age between the oldest teeth and the youngest teeth is used to determine the rate of tooth replacement.  Tooth replacement pattern  Many dinosaur teeth have been found to have a replacement pattern similar to other reptiles where a replacement tooth grows in the dental lamina on the inside of the jaw before migrating outwards, resorbing part of the growing functional tooth, until ready to erupt and replace it.  Tooth attachment  The tooth attachment mode of some dinosaurs has been referred to as thecodonty. This is a condition where the tooth is deeply implanted into the tooth socket with periodontal ligament present, as is the case in crocodilians and mammals. In mammals, thecodonty is associated with dental occlusion while in crocodilians it has been proposed as a means to reduce stresses from bite forces. Coelophysis possessed neither dental occlusion nor a strong bite, raising questions as to why it possesses thecodonty.  Dental batteries Close up of hadrosauridae dental batteries in various Hadrosaurid dinosaurs Diagram showing the dental battery in the rebbachisaurid genus Nigersaurus One of the most complex dentition found in dinosaurs are the dental batteries present in hadrosaurs (whose members were dominant species across the planet), Neoceratopsia (for example, Triceratops), and Rebbachisauridae. These batteries were formed from hundreds of teeth which were stacked in rows upon rows and formed a grinding surface to process plant foods. Histological study of these batteries found that they were not cemented together as previously thought, but that each tooth in the battery was separately moving and supported by ligamenture such that the whole structure was flexible. Comparable to shark teeth, dental batteries exhibited polyphyodonty, growing new teeth on the inside which migrated over time to replace the outer teeth. Unlike sharks however, who lose all of their old teeth, teeth in the rapidly growing dental battery would wear completely down and be reabsorbed by the renewing structure around it. The batteries were formed by the teeth growing fast and maturing early, to the point that the pulp cavity of individual teeth‚Äîusually filled with cells and connective tissue‚Äîwere totally filled with dentine before it even erupted. The lack of pulp in the tooth post-eruption means that the tooth was essentially dead and able to be completely worn away through use, and replaced without the risk of exposing the normally sensitive dental pulp to infection and pain. While other dinosaurs, such as some ceratopsians and sauropods, also possessed dental batteries, they all evolved independently and differ in some form or function from those of hadrosaurs. This shows that some dinosaurs had evolved extremely sophisticated chewing capabilities.

Numerical modeling uses mathematical models to describe the physical conditions of geological scenarios using numbers and equations. Nevertheless, some of their equations are difficult to solve directly, such as partial differential equations. With numerical models, geologists can use methods, such as finite difference methods, to approximate the solutions of these equations. Numerical experiments can then be performed in these models, yielding the results that can be interpreted in the context of geological process. Both qualitative and quantitative understanding of a variety of geological processes can be developed via these experiments. Numerical modelling has been used to assist in the study of rock mechanics, thermal history of rocks, movements of tectonic plates and the Earth's mantle. Flow of fluids is simulated using numerical methods, and this shows how ground water moves, or how motions of the molten outer core yields the geomagnetic field.  History  Prior to the development of numerical modeling, analog modeling, which simulates nature with reduced scales in mass, length, and time, was one of the major ways to tackle geological problems, for instance, to model the formation of thrust belts. Simple analytic or semi-analytic mathematical models were also used to deal with relatively simple geological problems quantitatively. In the late 1960s to 1970s, following the development of finite-element methods in solving continuum mechanics problems for civil engineering, numerical methods were adapted for modeling complex geological phenomena, for example, folding and mantle convection. With advances in computer technology, the accuracy of numerical models has been improved. Numerical modeling has become an important tool for tackling geological problems, especially for the parts of the Earth that are difficult to observe directly, such as the mantle and core. Yet analog modeling is still useful in modeling geological scenarios that are difficult to capture in numerical models, and the combination of analog and numerical modeling can be useful to improve understanding of the Earth's processes.  Components  Steps in numerical modeling. The first step in numerical modeling is to capture the actual geological scenario quantitatively. For example, in mantle convection modeling, heat equations are used to describe the heat energy circulating in the system while Navier‚ÄìStokes equations describe the flow of viscous fluid (the mantle rock). Second, since these equations are difficult to solve, discretization and numerical methods are chosen to make an approximation to the governing equations. Then, algorithms in the computer can calculate the approximated solutions. Finally, interpretation can be made from those solutions. For instance, in mantle convection modeling, the flow of mantle can first be visualized. Then, the relationship between the patterns of flow and the input parameters may be concluded. A general numerical model study usually consists of the following components: # Mathematical model is a simplified description of the geological problem, such as equations and boundary conditions. These governing equations of the model are often partial differential equations that are difficult to solve directly since it involves the derivative of the function, for example, the wave equation. # Discretization methods and numerical methods convert those governing equations in the mathematical models to discrete equations. These discrete equations can approximate the solution of the governing equations. Common methods include the finite element, finite difference, or finite volume method that subdivide the object of interest into smaller pieces (element) by mesh. These discrete equations can then be solved in each element numerically. The discrete element method uses another approach, this method reassembling the object of interest from numerous tiny particles. Simple governing equations are then applied to the interactions between particles. # Algorithms are computer programs that compute the solution using the idea of the above numerical methods. # Interpretations are made from the solutions given by the numerical models.  Properties  A good numerical model usually has some of the following properties: * Consistent: Numerical models often divide the object into smaller elements. If the model is consistent, the result of the numerical model is nearly the same as what the mathematical model predicts when the element size is nearly zero. In other words, the error between the discrete equations used in the numerical model and the governing equations in the mathematical model tends to zero when the space of the mesh (size of element) becomes close to zero. * Stable: In a stable numerical model, the error during the computation of the numerical methods does not amplify. The error of an unstable model will stack up quickly and lead to an incorrect result. A stable and consistent numerical model has the same output as the exact solution in the mathematical model when the spacing of the mesh (size of element) is extremely small. * Converging: The output of the numerical model is closer to the actual solution of the governing equations in the mathematical models when the spacing of mesh (size of element) reduces, which is usually checked by carrying out numerical experiments. * Conserved: The physical quantities in the models, such as mass and momentum, are conserved. Since the equations in the mathematical models are usually derived from various conservation laws, the model result should not violate these premises. * Bounded: The solution given by the numerical model has reasonable physical bounds with respect to the mathematical models, for instance mass and volume should be positive. * Accurate: The solution given by the numerical models is close to the real solution predicted by the mathematical model.  Computation  The following are some key aspects of ideas in developing numerical models in geology. First, the way to describe the object and motion should be decided (kinematic description). Then, governing equations that describe the geological problems are written, for example, the heat equations describe the flow of heat in a system. Since some of these equations cannot be solved directly, numerical methods are used to approximate the solution of the governing equations.  Kinematic descriptions  In numerical models and mathematical models, there are two different approaches to describe the motion of matter: Eulerian and Lagrangian. In geology, both approaches are commonly used to model fluid flow like mantle convection, where an Eulerian grid is used for computation and Lagrangian markers are used to visualize the motion. Recently, there have been models that try to describe different parts using different approaches to combine the advantages of these two approaches. This combined approach is called the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach. = Eulerian = The Eulerian approach considers the changes of the physical quantities, such as mass and velocity, of a fixed location with time. It is similar to looking at how river water flows past a bridge. Mathematically, the physical quantities can be expressed as a function of location and time. This approach is useful for fluid and homogeneous (uniform) materials that have no natural boundary. = Lagrangian = The Lagrangian approach, on the other hand, considers the change of physical quantities, such as the volume, of fixed elements of matter over time. It is similar to looking at a certain collection of water molecules as they flow downstream in a river. Using the Lagrangian approach, it is easier to follow solid objects which have natural boundary to separate them from the surrounding.  Governing equations  Following are some basic equations that are commonly used to describe physical phenomena, for example, how the matter in a geologic system moves or flows and how heat energy is distributed in a system. These equations are usually the core of the mathematical model. = Continuity equation = The continuity equation is a mathematical version of stating that the geologic object or medium is continuous, which means no empty space can be found in the object. This equation is commonly used in numerical modeling in geology. One example is the continuity equation of mass of fluid. Based on the law of conservation of mass, for a fluid with density \\\\rho at position x_j in a fixed volume V of fluid, the rate of change of mass is equal to the outward fluid flow across the boundary S: \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\int\\\\limits_V \\\\rho d \\\\tau = -\\\\int\\\\limits_S \\\\rho u_j d S_j where \\\\tau is the volume element and u_j is the velocity at x_j. In Lagrangian form: \\\\frac{D \\\\rho}{D t} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho}{\\\\partial t}+ u_j \\\\frac{ \\\\partial \\\\rho}{\\\\partial x_j} = - \\\\rho \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_j}{\\\\partial x_j} In Eulerian form: \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial(\\\\rho u_j)}{\\\\partial x_j} This equation is useful when the model involves continuous fluid flow, like the mantle is over geological time scales. = Momentum equation= The momentum equation describes how matter moves in response to force applied. It is an expression of Newton's second law of motion. Consider a fixed volume V of matter. By the law of conservation of momentum, the rate of change of volume is equal to: * external force F applied on the element * plus normal stress and shear stress applied on the surface S bounding the element * minus the momentum moving out of the element on that surface \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\int\\\\limits_V \\\\rho u_i d \\\\tau = \\\\int\\\\limits_V \\\\rho F_i d\\\\tau + \\\\int\\\\limits_S \\\\sigma_{ij}dS_j - \\\\int\\\\limits_S \\\\rho u_i u_j dS_j where \\\\tau is the volume element, u is the velocity. After simplifications and integrations, for any volume V, the Eulerian form of this equation is: \\\\rho \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_i}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\rho u_j \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_i}{\\\\partial x_j}= \\\\rho F_i + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\sigma_{ij}}{\\\\partial x_j} = Heat equation = The heat equations describe how heat energy flows in a system. From the law of conservation of energy, the rate of change of energy E of a fixed volume V of mass is equal to: * work done at the boundary S * plus work done by external force F in the volume V * minus heat conduction across boundary S * minus heat convection across boundary S * plus heat produced internally Mathematically: \\\\frac{ \\\\partial }{\\\\partial t}\\\\int\\\\limits_V \\\\rho E d \\\\tau = \\\\int\\\\limits_S u_i \\\\sigma_{ij}dS_j + \\\\int\\\\limits_V \\\\rho u_i F_i d \\\\tau - \\\\int\\\\limits_S k \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial x_j} dS_j-\\\\int\\\\limits_S \\\\rho E u_{j} dS_j + \\\\int\\\\limits_V \\\\rho H d\\\\tau where \\\\tau is the volume element, u is the velocity, T is the temperature, k is the conduction coefficient and H is the rate of heat production.  Numerical methods  vertices of the triangles.300x300pxthumb Numerical methods are techniques to approximate the governing equations in the mathematical models. Common numerical methods include finite element method, spectral method, finite difference method, and finite volume method. These methods are used to approximate the solution of governing differential equations in the mathematical model by dissecting the domain into meshes or grids and applying simpler equations to individual elements or nodes in the mesh. Approximating wave equations using the finite element method. The domain is subdivided into numerous triangles. The values of the nodes in the mesh are calculated, showing how a wave propagates in the region. The discrete element method uses another approach. The object is considered an assemblage of small particles. = Finite element method = The finite element method subdivides the object (or domain) into smaller, non-overlapping elements (or subdomains) and these elements are connected at the nodes. The solution for the partial differential equations are then approximated by simpler element equations, usually polynomials. Then these element equations are combined into equations for the entire object, i.e. the contribution of each element is summed up to model the response of the whole object. This method is commonly used to solve mechanical problems. The following are the general steps of using the finite element method: # Select the element type and subdivide the object. Common element types include triangular, quadrilateral, tetrahedral, etc. Different types of elements should be chosen for different problems. # Decide the function of displacement. The function of displacement governs how the elements move. Linear, quadratic, or cubic polynomial functions are commonly used. # Decide the displacement-strain relation. The displacement of the element changes or deforms the element's shape in what is technically called strain. This relation calculates how much strain the element experienced due to the displacement. # Decide the strain-stress relation. The deformation of the element induces stress to the element, which is the force applied to the element. This relation calculates the amount of stress experienced by the element due to the strain. One of the examples of this relation is Hooke's law. # Derive equations of stiffness and stiffness matrix for elements. The stress also causes the element to deform; the stiffness (the rigidity) of the elements indicates how much it will deform in response to the stress. The stiffness of the elements in different directions is represented in matrix form for simpler operation during calculation. # Combine the element equations into global equations. The contributions of every element are summed up to a set of equations that describe the whole system. # Apply boundary conditions. The predefined conditions at the boundary, such as temperature, stress, and other physical quantities are introduced to the boundary of the system. # Solve for displacement. As time evolves, the displacement of the elements are solved step by step. # Solve for strains and stress. After the displacement is calculated, the strains and stress are computed using the relations in steps 3 and 4. Burgers Equation, which describes how shock waves behave, using spectral method. The domain is first subdivided into rectangular mesh. The idea of this method is similar to the finite element method. = Spectral method = The spectral method is similar to the finite element method. The major difference is that spectral method uses basis functions, possibly by using a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) that approximates the function by the sum of numerous simple functions. These kinds of basis functions can then be applied to the whole domain and approximate the governing partial differential equations. Therefore, each calculation takes the information from the whole domain into account while the finite element method only takes the information from the neighborhood. As a result, the spectral method converges exponentially and is suitable for solving problems involving a high variability in time or space. = Finite volume method = The finite volume method is also similar to the finite element method. It also subdivides the object of interest into smaller volumes (or elements), then the physical quantities are solved over the control volume as fluxes of these quantities across the different faces. The equations used are usually based on the conservation or balance of physical quantities, like mass and energy. The finite volume method can be applied on irregular meshes like the finite element method. The element equations are still physically meaningful. However, it is difficult to get better accuracy, as the higher order version of element equations are not well-defined. = Finite difference method = The finite difference method approximates differential equations by approximating the derivative with a difference equation, which is the major method to solve partial differential equations. center Consider a function f(x) with single-valued derivatives that are continuous and finite functions of x, according to Taylor's theorem: f(x+\\\\Delta x) = f(x) + \\\\Delta x f'(x) + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\Delta x ^2 f(x) + \\\\frac{1}{6}\\\\Delta x^3 f'(x)+\\\\cdots and f(x-\\\\Delta x) = f(x) - \\\\Delta x f'(x) + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\Delta x ^2 f(x) - \\\\frac{1}{6}\\\\Delta x^3 f'(x)+\\\\cdots Summing up the above expressions: f(x+\\\\Delta x) + f(x-\\\\Delta x ) = 2f(x) + \\\\Delta x^2 f(x) + \\\\text{terms with higher than 4th power of } \\\\Delta x Ignore the terms with higher than 4th power of x , then: f(x) \\\\simeq \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x ^2}\\\\left[ f(x+\\\\Delta x) - 2f(x) - f(x-\\\\Delta x) \\\\right] f'(x) \\\\simeq \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\Delta x}\\\\left[ f(x+\\\\Delta x) - f(x-\\\\Delta x) \\\\right] The above is the central-difference approximation of the derivatives, which can also be approximated by forward- difference: f'(x) \\\\simeq \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x}\\\\left[ f(x+\\\\Delta x) - f(x) \\\\right] or backward-difference: f'(x) \\\\simeq \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x}\\\\left[ f(x) - f(x-\\\\Delta x) \\\\right] The accuracy of the finite differences can be improved when more higher order terms are used. = Discrete element method = An example of model using discrete element method, which uses photo of thumb The discrete element method, sometimes called distinct element method, is usually used to model discontinuous materials, such as rocks with fractures like joints and bedding, since it can explicitly model the properties of discontinuities. This method was developed to simulate rock mechanics problems at the beginning. The main idea of this method is to model the objects as an assemblage of smaller particles, which is similar to building a castle out of sand. These particles are of simple geometry, such as a sphere. The physical quantities of each particle, such as velocity, are continuously updated at the contacts between them. This model is relatively computationally intensive, as a large quantity of particles needs to be used, especially for large-scale models, like a slope. Therefore, this model is usually applied to small-scale objects.  Bonded-particle model  There are objects that are not composed of granular materials, such as crystalline rocks composed of mineral grains that stick to each other or interlock with each other. Some bonding between particles is added to model this cohesion or cementation between particles. This kind of model is also called a bonded-particle model.  Applications  Numerical modeling can be used to model problems in different fields of geology at various scales, such as engineering geology, geophysics, geomechanics, geodynamics, rock mechanics, and hydrogeology. The following are some examples of applications of numerical modeling in geology.  Specimen to outcrop scale  = Rock mechanics = Numerical modeling has been widely applied in different fields of rock mechanics. Rock is a material that is difficult to model because rock are usually: * Discontinuous: There are numerous fractures and micro-fractures in a rock mass and the space in the rock mass maybe filled with other substances like air and water. A complex model is needed to fully capture these discontinuities, since the discontinuities have great effects on the rock mass. * Anisotropic: The properties of rock mass, such as permeability (the ability to allow fluid to flow through), may vary in different directions. * Inhomogeneous: The properties of different portions of the rock mass may be different. For example, the physical properties of quartz grains and feldspar grains are different in granite. * Not elastic: Rock cannot perfectly revert to its original shape after stress is removed. In order to model the behaviors of rock, a complex model that takes all the above characteristics into account is needed. There are many models modeling rock as a continuum using methods like finite difference, finite element, and boundary element methods. One of the disadvantages is that the ability of modeling cracks and other discontinuities is usually limited in these models. Models that model rock as a discontinuum, using methods like discrete element and discrete fracture network methods, are also commonly employed. Combinations of both methods have also been developed. Numerical modeling enhances the understanding of mechanical processes in rock by conducting numerical experiments, and is useful for design and construction works.  Regional-scale  = Thermochronology = Numerical modeling has been used to predict and describe the thermal history of the Earth's crust, which allows geologists to improve their interpretation of thermochronological data. Thermochronology can indicate the time at which a rock cooled below a particular temperature. Geologic events, like the development of a faults and surface erosion, can change the thermochronological pattern of samples collected on the surface, and it is possible to constrain the geologic events by these data. Numerical modeling can be used to predict the pattern. The difficulties of thermal modeling of the Earth's crust mainly involve the irregularity and the changes of the Earth's surface (mainly erosion) through time. Therefore, in order to model the morphological changes of the Earth's surface, the models need to solve heat equations with boundary conditions that change with time and have irregular meshes.  Pecube  Pecube is one of the numerical models developed to predict the thermochronological pattern. It solves the following generalized heat transfer equation with advection using finite element method. The first three terms on the right-hand side are the heat transferred by conduction in x , y and z directions while A is the advection. \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} + u \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial x} + v \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial y} + w \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial z} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} \\\\kappa \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y} \\\\kappa \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial y} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z} \\\\kappa \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial z} + A After the temperature field is constructed in the model, particle paths are traced and the cooling history of the particles can be obtained. The pattern of thermochronological age can then be computed. A cross-section showing the thermal and exhumation patterns of the crust generated by the movement of a fault. The simulation is generated by Pecube [Helsinki University Geodynamics Group (HUGG) version]. The model is three-dimensional; the figure shows a slice of the model for simplicity. In the figure, the white line indicates the fault. The small black arrows indicate the direction of movement of the material at that point. The red lines are isotherm (the point of the line are of same temperature). The Pecube model uses both Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches. The fault can be regarded as stationary and the crust is moving. Initially, the temperature of the crust depends on the depth. The deeper the depth, the hotter the material. During this event, the motion of crust along the fault moves the material with different temperatures. In the hanging wall (the block above the fault), hotter material from deeper depth moves towards the surface; while the cooler material at shallower depth in the footwall (the block below the fault) moves deeper. The flow of material changes the thermal pattern (the isotherm bends across the fault) of the crust, which may reset the thermochronometers in the rock. On the other hand, the exhumation rate also affects the thermochronometers in the rock. A positive rate of exhumation indicates the rock is moving towards the surface, while a negative rate of exhumation indicate the rock is moving downwards. The fault geometry impacts the pattern exhumation rate on the surface. = Hydrogeology = In hydrogeology, groundwater flow is often modeled numerically by the finite element method and finite difference method. These two methods have been shown to produce similar results if the mesh is fine enough.thumb  MODFLOW  One of the well- known programs in modeling groundwater flow is MODFLOW, developed by the United States Geological Survey. It is a free and open-source program that uses the finite difference method as the framework to model groundwater conditions. The recent development of related programs offers more features, including: * Interactions between groundwater and surface-water systems * Transportation of solutes * Flow of fluid with variable density, such as salt water * Compaction of aquifer systems * Subsidence of land * Management of groundwater = Crustal dynamics = The rheology (response of materials to stress) of crust and the lithosphere is complex, since a free surface (the land surface) and the plasticity and elasticity of the crustal materials need to be considered. Most of the models use finite element methods with a Lagrangian mesh. One usage is the study of deformation and kinematics of subduction.  FLAC  The Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC) is one of the most popular approaches in modeling crustal dynamics. The approach is fast as it solves the equations of momentum and continuity without using a matrix, hence it is fast but time steps must be small enough. The approach has been used in 2D, 2.5D, and 3D studies of crustal dynamics, in which the 2.5D results were generated by combining multiple slices of two- dimensional results. Cathaysia Block, which makes up the southeast part of the South China carton. This model uses the code called Flamar, which is a FLAC- like code that combines finite difference and finite element methods. The element used in this Lagrangian mesh is quadrilateral. The boundary conditions applied to the land surface are free, which is affected by erosion and sediment deposition. The boundary on the sides is at constant velocity, which will push the crust to subduct. The boundary condition used at the bottom is called \\"Winkler's pliable basement\\". It is at hydrostatic equilibrium and it allows the base to slip freely horizontally.center  Global-scale  = Mantle convection = core-mantle boundary (inner boundary) is a constant of 4273 K (about 4000‚ÑÉ), while that at the boundary between crust and mantle (outer boundary) is 973 K (about 700‚ÑÉ). The mesh in the simulation changes over time. The code uses adaptive mesh refinement, the mesh is finer in the areas that need more accurate calculation, such as the rising plumes, while the mesh is coarser in other area to save the computational power. In the figure, red color indicates a warmer temperature while blue color indicate a cooler temperature; hot material rises from the core mantle boundary due to lower density. When the hot material reaches the outer boundary, it starts to move in horizontally and eventually sinks due to cooling. There are many attempts to model mantle convection. Finite element, finite volume, finite difference and spectral methods have all been used in modeling mantle convection, and almost every model used an Eulerian grid. Due to the simplicity and speed of the finite-difference and spectral methods, they were used in some early models, but finite-element or finite volume methods were generally adopted in the 2010s. Many benchmark papers have investigated the validity of these numerical models. Current approaches mostly uses a fixed and uniform grid. Grid refinement, in which the size of the elements is reduced in the part that requires more accurate approximation, is possibly the direction of future development in numerical modeling of mantle convection.  Finite difference approach  In the 1960s to 1970s, mantle convection models using the finite difference approach usually used second-order finite differences. Stream functions were used to remove the effect of pressure and reduce the complexity of the algorithm. Due to the advancement in computer technology, finite differences with higher order terms are now used to generate a more accurate result.  Finite volume approach  Mantle convection modeled by finite volume approach is often based on the balance between pressure and momentum. The equations derived are the same as the finite difference approach using a grid with staggered velocity and pressure, in which the values of velocity and the pressure of each element are located at different points. This approach can maintain the coupling between velocity and pressure. Multiple codes are developed based on this finite difference/finite volume approach. In modeling three-dimensional geometry of the Earth, since the parameters of mantles vary at different scales, multigrid, which means using different grid sizes for different variables, is applied to overcome the difficulties. Examples include the cubed sphere grid, 'Yin-Yang' grid, and spiral grid.  Finite element approach  In the finite element approach, stream functions are also often used to reduce the complexity of the equations. ConMan, modeling two-dimensional incompressible flow in the mantle, was one of the popular codes for modeling mantle convection in the 1990s. Citcom, an Eulerian mutlgrid finite element model, is one of the most popular programs to model mantle convection in 2D and 3D.  Spectral method  The spectral method in mantle convection breaks down the three-dimensional governing equation into several one-dimensional equations, which solves the equations much faster. It was one of the popular approaches in early models of mantle convection. Many program were developed using this method during the 1980s to early 2000s. However, the lateral changes of viscosity of mantle are difficult to manage in this approach, and other methods became more popular in the 2010s. The Earth consists of several plates. Numerical models can be used to model the kinematics of plates. = Plate tectonics = Plate tectonics is a theory suggesting that the Earth's lithosphere is essentially composed of plates floating on the mantle. The mantle convection model is fundamental in modeling the plates floating on it, and there are two major approaches to incorporate the plates into this model: rigid-block approach and rheological approach. The rigid-block approach assumes the plates are rigid, which means the plates keep their shape and do not deform, just like some wooden blocks floating on water. In contrast, the rheological approach models the plates as a highly viscous fluid in which the equations applied to the lithosphere beneath also apply to the plates on top. = Geodynamo = Numerical models have been made to verify the geodynamo theory, a theory that posits that the geomagnetic field is generated by the motion of conductive iron and nickel fluid in the Earth's core. Modeling of the flow of Earth's liquid outer core is difficult because: * the Coriolis effect due to the Earth's rotation cannot be ignored * the magnetic field generated will also generate Lorentz force, which will affect the motion of the conductive fluid in the liquid outer core * the low viscosity of liquid iron makes the fluid flow hard to model Most of the models use the spectral method to simulate the geodynamo, for example the Glatzmaier-Roberts model. Finite difference method has also been used in the model by Kageyama and Sato. Some study also tried other methods, like finite volume and finite element methods. magnetic reversal. = Seismology = Simulation of seismic wave propagation through the Earth. Finite difference methods have been widely used in simulations of the propagation of seismic waves. However, due to limitations in computation power, in some models, the spacing of the mesh is too large (compared with the wavelength of the seismic waves) so that the results are inaccurate due to grid dispersion, in which the seismic waves with different frequencies separate. Some researchers suggest using the spectral method to model seismic wave propagation.  Errors and limitations   Sources of error  While numerical modeling provides accurate quantitative estimation to geological problems, there is always a difference between the actual observation and the modeling results due to: * the simplification of the actual problem when building the numerical model. Since numerous factors can affect a geological system, it is nearly impossible to take everything into account. Therefore, a numerical model usually simplifies the actual system by omitting the less significant factors. For instance, the Earth is often modeled as a sphere, despite the undulation of Earth's surface. * the approximations or idealizations of the governing equations. Many objects in nature are complex. It is impossible to capture all the characteristics using equations. For instance, rocks are discontinuous, but modeling rock as a continuous material is reasonable at large scale as it describes the properties accurately enough. * the approximations in the discretization process. Since the governing equations in the model cannot be solved directly, approximations to these equations are made using discretization and numerical methods. * the uncertainty in physical parameters. For example, the models of the viscosity of mantle and core are not accurate.  Limitations  Apart from the errors, there are some limitations in using numerical models: * Users of the models need a high level of knowledge and experience to prevent misuse and misinterpretation of results.

The geology of Myanmar is shaped by dramatic, ongoing tectonic processes controlled by shifting tectonic components as the Indian plate slides northwards and towards Southeast Asia. Myanmar spans across parts of three tectonic plates (the Indian Plate, Burma microplate and Shan Thai Block) separated by north- trending faults. To the west, a highly oblique subduction zone separates the offshore Indian plate from the Burma microplate, which underlies most of the country. In the center-east of Myanmar, a right lateral strike slip fault extends from south to north across more than . These tectonic zones are responsible for large earthquakes in the region. The India-Eurasia plate collision which initiated in the Eocene provides the last geological pieces of Myanmar, and thus Myanmar preserves a more extensive Cenozoic geological record as compared to records of the Mesozoic and Paleozoic eras. Myanmar is physiographically divided into three regions: the Indo-Burman Range, Myanmar Central Belt and the Shan Plateau; these all display an arcuate shape bulging westwards. The varying regional tectonic settings of Myanmar not only give rise to disparate regional features, but they also foster the formation of petroleum basins and a diverse mix of mineral resources.  Regional geology  The figure shows a simplified version of the regional features in Myanmar. The three physiographical region from west to east: Indo-Burman Range, Myanmar Central Belt and Shan Plateau. The Mogok Metamorphic Belt (MMB) is expressed with dashed lines. Modified from Bender (1983). Myanmar is classified into three physiographical regions, each region spans over Myanmar in near NS direction, from west to east is: the Indo-Burman folded mountain ranges, the Myanmar Central Belt (MCB) and the Shan Plateau. To the north of Myanmar, the eastern Himalaya syntaxis bounds the three physiographical region.  The arc-shaped structure of Myanmar  Myanmar has a complex arc-shaped deformation structure, which is probably due to the a combination of various forces. Aside from the subduction system on the west and the strike-slip fault system in the central Myanmar, another major contribution may be the crustal flow from the Tibet Plateau. The Tibet Plateau is located at the north of Myanmar and has been considerably thickened since the Eocene. A large amount of potential energy stored within the thickened Tibetan crust was released, and resulted in a crustal flow around the eastern Himalaya Syntaxis. The crustal flow runs towards west and into the central region of Myanmar. This crustal flow, along with the accretionary wedge in the subduction system, may have participated in the late Neogene uplift of Indo-Burman Range.  Indo- Burman Ranges  The Indo-Burman Range sits at the convergent boundary of the Indian and Burma-micro Plates in Myanmar. The subduction between the two plates resulted in the development of accretionary wedges, in order to accommodate the EW shortening along the convergent boundary. Later, thrusting, folding and uplifting formed the Indo-Burman Ranges. The mountain belt comprises various mountains: the Arakan-Yoma mountains and the Chin, Naga, Maniour, Lushai and Patkai hills. The Indo-Burman Range merged with Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis further north, submerged into the Andaman Sea, and resurfaced as Andaman Islands further south. The Indo-Burman Range bulges towards the west at the center (about 22¬∞N), forming an arc-shaped structure. This arc-shaped structure implies restriction on the convergent motion along the Indian-Burma boundary, therefore the collision intensity varies along the range. The collision is at a maximum at the center of the Indo-Burman Range around 24¬∞N, which is presented with a broad, high range (up to 20 km wide) and evolves to narrow, low hills in the south (16¬∞N). The collision strikes in NW-SE at the northern part of the Indo-Burman Range (Naga Domain).  Myanmar Central Belt  The 1000 km Myanmar Central Belt consists of a series of Cenozoic sub-basins between the Indo-Burman Range (west) and Sagaing Fault (east). These basins are generally considered as forearc/back arc basin couplet of the Indo-Burma subduction system. The eight major tertiary sub- basins within the Myanmar Central Belt are Hukwang, Chindwin, Shwebo, Salin, Pyay Embayment, Irrawaddy Delta, Bago-Yoma, and Sittaung Basin. A variety of structural features‚Äîsuch as oblique-reverse faults, strike slip faults and normal faults‚Äîcan be found within the central belt. The abundant evidence of shear zones suggests the Myanmar Central Belt has undergone severe internal deformation. The exposed metamorphic lineation along the belt indicates different motions within the central belt: (1) dextral pull apart geometry trending in a north-northwest direction during Oligocene to early Miocene forming an \\"en-echelon\\" pull-apart basin: (2) fault-propagated folds cored in a west-dipping thrust fault in the basin center implies an east-west trending transpressional deformation from Pliocene-Pleistocene onwards.  Shan Plateau  The Shan Plateau, with an average elevation of , forms the eastern highlands of Myanmar. It provides the major topographic relief in Myanmar and it extends towards the southeast to Thailand. The plateau, unlike other regions Myanmar, comprises thick successions of Paleozoic, Mesozoic and even Precambrian sedimentary rocks. The folding, thrusting and uplifting of the Shan Plateau is probably coeval with the transpressional deformation along the Myanmar Central Belt during the commencement of the India-Eurasia collision.  Mogok Metamorphic Belt  Situated on the east of the Sagaing fault and the west of Shan plateau, the Mogok Metamorphic Belt (MMB) lies at the foothill of Shan Scarp. It runs in a near north-south direction and extends over 1500 km with an average width of 24‚Äì40 km. The meta-sedimentary and meta- intrusive belt is composed of marbles, schists, gneisses of upper amphibolite, with locally granulite facies intruded by a deformed granodiorite pluton and pegmatites. The belt also shows evidence for ductile stretching along the north-northwest-south-southeast direction, e.g. lineation, sheath folds and ‚Äúpencil-like‚Äù mullions. Various radiometric dating confirms the age of Mogok Metamorphic Belt predates the Sagaing Fault, and the shear heating of Sagaing Fault has no contribution to the formation of Mogok Metamorphic Belt. Searle (2007) suggested a five-phased metamorphism and magmatism along the Mogok Metamorphic Belt. # Jurassic-Early Cretaceous I-Type intrusion and metamorphism (171‚Äì120 Ma) # Paleocene-Early Eocene metamorphism of biotite granite sill injection (~59 Ma) # Late Eocene-Oligocene metamorphism of sillimanite (37‚Äì29 Ma) # Late Oligocene-Early Miocene granite magmatism (22‚Äì16 Ma) # Pliocene-Quaternary volcanism (0‚Äì6 Ma) Note: Ma (mega-annum) is a million years Simplified geological cross section of Myanmar at latitude 21¬∞N. SG refers to Sagaing fault. Inspired and modified from Rangin et al. (2013) and Mitchell (1989).  Lithology   Indo-Burman Range  Maungdaw district. The Indo-Burman Range is a sedimentary belt mainly consisted of Cenozoic flysch sediments and a core of Mesozoic ophiolites dated back to late Jurassic overlain on a thick Mesozoic sequence. All the above unconformity lies on a metamorphic basement dated back to pre-Triassic. The core Mesozoic ophiolites consists of serpentinite peridotites, pillow basalts and red cherts etc. The obduction of ophiolites is interpreted as the closure of several Neo- Tethys between the Shan-Thai block, Burma microplate and Indian Plate. The sedimentary sequence overlain by the ophiolites ranges from Late Triassic to Orbitoides-bearing Late Cretaceous carbonates and shales, where part of the sedimentary sequence has undergone high pressure/low temperature blue-schist metamorphism. The pre-Triassic metamorphic basement composed of Kampetlet schist and gneisses were exposed in the Mount Victoria area in Myanmar. The flysch type sediments in the western flank of the Indo-Burman Range are relatively younger than the folded and thrusted eastern flank.  Myanmar Central Belt  The Cenozoic pull-apart basins along the Myanmar Central Belt (MCB) are filled-up with 15 km thick Late Cretaceous and Eocene to Late Miocene sediments.  The Shan Plateau  Belonging to the rigid Shan-Thai block, the Shan Plateau is composed of consolidated partially low-grade metamorphic and Precambrian crystalline rocks overlain with a thick succession of Palaeozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks.  Tectonic settings  The figure shows the location of plates around Myanmar. Myanmar is traced in dotted red lines, where the strike slip fault is the Sagaing fault and the thrust fault is the Kabaw fault. Modified with Alam et al. (2003) The tectonic setting of Myanmar consists of a highly oblique convergence on the western boundary, a dextral (right lateral) strike-slip fault in the centre of Myanmar defining the Burma-Sunda boundary and the spreading of Andaman Sea Ridge in the south.  Highly oblique Indo-Burma Boundary (Arakan Trench and Andaman Trench)  From the Eocene epoch onward, the northward movement of Indian Plate collided with the Eurasian Plate and generated the Himalaya Orogenic belt. The relative motion of the Indian plate against the Eurasian plate (Sunda) has two components (1) 36 mm/year right lateral strike-slip, trending in N10¬∞E direction; (2) 7‚Äì9 mm/year east-west convergence. The convergent motion is absorbed by a highly oblique subduction zone between the Indian plate and Burma-micro plate and internal deformation in the centre of Myanmar on the Sagaing Fault. The obliquity of the Indo-Burma convergent plate boundary (Arakan Trench and Andaman Trench) increases further northwards, with a minimum angle of 58¬∞ at 20¬∞N latitude to 70¬∞ near 22¬∞N latitude, and rapidly increases to 90¬∞ near 24¬∞N latitude and over 90¬∞ to further North. The boundary between Indo-Burma region runs further southward into the Bay of Bengal and joins the Sumatra Trench. This figure shows the India plate motion with reference to the Shan Thai (Sunda) plate. The N10¬∞E 35 mm/yr convergence is accommodated by the 20 mm/yr right lateral Sagaing strike slip fault, the 9 mm/yr convergent Kabaw thrust fault and 14 mm/yr subduction the Andaman Trench. Modified from Socquet et al. 2006.  Fault systems  In order to accommodate the India-Eurasia collision, extensive fault systems can be found in Myanmar. The following introduces two of the major fault systems. = The Sagaing Fault = The 20mm/yr dextral (right lateral) strike slip Sagaing Fault detaches the Burma microplate from the Sunda plate. The arc-parallel fault spans over 1400 km in a north-south direction, remarkably linear for the central 700 km (at 17¬∞N to 23¬∞N latitude) and forms a slight arc shape swinging N10¬∞E and N170¬∞E direction at the north and south ends of the fault respectively. Northward, the Sagaing fault terminates at the Jade Mine belt (~ 24.5¬∞N) and splays into a 200 km width compressive horsetail structure. Southward, it is connected to the active Andaman spreading rift. The onset of seafloor spreading on the Andaman rift puts a minimum 4.5 Ma age constraint on the Sagaing Fault. The total displacement of the right lateral strike slip fault remains controversial. Curray et al. (1979) suggested a total 460 km of displacement since Miocene; whereas Khin Zaw (1990) proposed 250 km since post Lower Miocene. Guillaume & Rangin (2003) deduced approximately 100 km by constraining a continuous 20mm/yr right lateral strike slip since 4-5Ma. = Shan Scarp = The topographic boundary separating the Myanmar Central Basin (MCB) and the Shan Plateau (or Eastern Highland) is referred as the Shan Scarp. The abrupt elevation over a short distance (up to 1.8 km over few km) harbors the trace of reverse faults and largely overturned folds. The Shan Scarp aligns parallel to the Sagaing fault on the east. The general trend of reverse fault strikes is N20¬∞W and dips in the east-northeast direction; where some N20¬∞E striking normal faults were identified along the fault scarp (at 21¬∞N to 22¬∞N latitude), north of Mandalay. Dextral (right lateral) strike slip motion is also observed along the fault scarp, this motion is reasonably expected due to the nearby right lateral Sagaing fault. Southward, the Shan Scarp ends at the junction with the Three Pagodas fault. Along the foothills of the Shan Scarp, steady-state stretching ductile deformation trending in NNW-SSE direction was identified and is compatible with the extensive force that generates the en-echelon pull apart basin in Myanmar Central Belt (MCB). The above evidence suggests ductile deformation along Myanmar Central Belt (MCB) should occur prior to the brittle deformation along Sagaing fault and the Shan Scarp fault. Simplified diagram showing the tectonic deformation along Shan Plateau and the Sagaing fault. 1) The NE-SW extensional ductile deformation along this region was dated prior to Late Miocene. 2) The brittle dextral strike slip fault and thrust fault along the Shan Scarp and the Sagaing fault is dated back to Plio-Pleistocene period. Modified from Bertrand et al. (2003)  Geological evolution of Myanmar  Myanmar lies on the boundary of three tectonic plates (India, Burma-micro and Sunda Plate), thus its geological evolution is highly dependent on the plate tectonic events in this region. In the following, the geological evolution of Myanmar will be explained in the order of geological timescale. Only major tectonic events are recorded with some missing timescale where no major events occurred. A simplified geological evolution of Myanmar. (ST=South Tibet; B= Burma; IC=Indochina; S=Sumatra; RRF=Red River Fault; SB= Shan-Thai Block). (a) The rifting of Gondwana (b) The start of \\"soft collision\\" between India and Southeast Asia. (c) The start of \\"hard collision\\" between India and South Asia. (d) The time for major collision between India, South Tibet and Burma; where Burma, Shan-Thai Block rotates clockwise to the present position. Modified from Alam et al. (2003).  Paleozoic Era  = Permian (~ 300 million years ago) = In the early Permian, a continental block rifted from Gondwanaland. The continental plate has been variously termed: Shan-Thai, Sibumasu, or Sinoburmalaya. This continental block harbors features of glaciogenic marine diamictite unit, indicating its origin from Gondwanaland. The Shan-Thai block was probably located northwest of Australia plate during the Gondwanaland period.  Mesozoic Era  = Late Triassic to Jurassic Period (~ 235 ‚Äì 145 million years ago) = In the mid-late Triassic, the Shan-Thai block collided with the Indo-China block, and under-thrusted an ophiolite and associated arc system in the northeast. A foreland thrust belt developed along the collision of the two blocks and laid the foundation of the Shan Plateau. A thick flysch unit with fossils and deltaic sediments were deposited along the northeastern Shan-Thai block (now Shan Plateau) with the closing of a shallow sea region between the two blocks prior to collision. Large-scale intrusion of granitoid plutons and batholiths were induced by oceanic subduction; and partial melting of metasedimentary rocks within the foreland thrust belt led to tin-tungsten mineralization (the Central Tin Belt). = Cretaceous Period (~ 145 ‚Äì 66 million years ago) = The India Plate departed from the Gondwanaland and headed northwards at a rate of 10 cm/yr during the Cretaceous Period. The rifted Burma-microplate from Gondwanaland also docked against Shan-Thai block and together formed part of the Sunda plate approximately in the period. There is a discrepancy for the time of the Burma-Shan-Thai collision: Mitchell (1989) says Early Cretaceous yet changes to Mid-Eocene in 1993; Hutchison (1989) says Late Cretaceous; and Acharyya (1998) says late Oligocene.  Cenozoic Era  = Early Eocene to Miocene (~ 55 - 10 million years ago) = In early Eocene, the start of a hard continent-to-continent collision between India and the Eurasia Plate led to the formation of the Himalayan Orogeny. On the eastern margin of the India plate, high oblique subduction occurs between the boundary of India and the Burma-micro plate. Between late Eocene to Miocene, the Burma and Shan-Thai block rotated 30¬∞ to 40¬∞ clockwise, to accommodate the major collision along the plate boundary. This resulted in the trend of arc shifting from east-west to the north-south direction. The subduction boundary forms an accretionary prism and eventually with thrusting and folding forms the Indo-Burma Range. = Late Miocene onwards (~ 10 million years ago) = In late Miocene to Pliocene, the slab detachment of Burma-microplate beneath the Shan-Thai block induced in a mantle window into the slab and resulted in alkaline and calk- alkaline volcanism along the Myanmar Central Belt. In the late Miocene (10 million years ago), the Myanmar Central Belt underwent a major regional plate kinematic reorganization transition. The tectonic regimes transform from northwest-southeast extensional force to basin inversion and was followed by a major uplift event caused by east-west compression during Plio-Pleistocene period.  Geological resources   Mineral belts  Myanmar hosts a variety of ore-deposits with economic significance and global recognition. It is a global source of true jade and produces some of the world's finest rubies, with mines in the Mogok Valley providing the bulk of the world's supply for centuries. Myanmar's mineral deposits into different distinct metallogenic provinces by various workers. The following outlines the nine major ones: # Magmatic-hydrothermal granite and pegmatite-hosted minerals: World-class tin and tungsten mineralization can be found in the southern Myanmar. These mineralizations are often associated with Late Cretaceous- Eocene intrusive granites. It is dated around 45-62 Ma. # Skarn: Found along the Mogok Metamorphic belt, the native gold and base metal sulfide is hosted within phlogopite-bearing amphibolite-grade marbles. The age of the granite is dated back to 17Ma with zircon U-Pb geochronology. # Porphyry: The base metal sulphide and Au deposits are associated with magmatic intrusions. The mineralization at Shangalon in Myanmar is related with fine-grained diorite intrusion into the hosting batholith at 40Ma. # Epithermal: The epithermal Au- Cu mineralization along with auriferous quartz veins are hosted by Cretaceous granodiorite and diorite magmatic rocks. # Ultramafic: The ultramafic-hosted deposits are discovered along with ophiolite fragments within the Myanmar. The Tagaung-Myitkyina Belt (TMB) comprises ophiolitic mantle peridotite and is a source of nickel laterite. In the Hpakant region, extensive pure jade can be found. The Indo-Burman Range (e.g. Chin and Naga Hills) also harbors many Chromite and nickel deposits. # Orogenic Au: Gold mineralization in Myanmar is inferred as Orogenic type and or Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene fault zone related. # Sediment-hosted Pb-Zn: Several lead-zinc sulphide deposits hosted in carbonate rocks were found in the Upper Palaeozoic carbonate sequence of Shan Plateau. # Gemstone: The finest rubies are sourced from Mogok Metamorphic Belt derived from marbles. The gem-quality rubies are formed under an Eocene-Oligocene high temperature metamorphism. # Sediment hosted Epithermal Au: The Kyaukpahto Mine is the largest gold-producing mine located around the Sagaing Division in Myanmar. Gold mineralization here is formed during extensional faulting (probably due to Sagaing fault) and intense hydrothermal alteration and silicification in late Eocene.  Petroleum basin  The hydrocarbon basins in Myanmar are mostly situated in the Central Myanmar Belt, e.g. Salin Basin, Chindwin Basin and Hukawng Basin over 1000 km. The formations that compose the hydrocarbon basins are sedimentary rocks of Eocene through mid-Mioceneand sealed with interbedded Oligocene and Miocene shales and clays.

The oldest rocks, the Proterozoic metamorphic basement, are not widely exposed, but mostly found in the western part of the Island. Hainan is mainly covered by igneous rocks emplaced from Permian through Cretaceous periods. Structurally, there are two main sets of faults, one trending east and the other northeast. The formation of the oldest fault, Gezhen shear fault, can even be dated back to the Precambrian times. The multiple stages of granitoid emplacements through its geological history have made Hainan Island rich in various types of ore deposits, including gold, molybdenum, lead, zinc, silver, etc. According to the distribution of the ore deposits, the Island is generally divided into 6 ore-forming provinces. Regarding the present geological activities, small earthquakes are still happening, while the volcanoes are inactive.Satellite Image of Hainan Island  Lithology and geological setting   Precambrian (older than 542 million years ago)  Geological Map of Hainan Island Geological time scale for Hainan Island showing the corresponding lithology, deposition environments and tectonic events The Precambrian rock layers are not well exposed in Hainan Island where the outcrops are mainly found in its western part. The crustal basement of the Island had an earliest age probably up to ca. 4000 to 3800 Ma. The continental crust was then reworked in the later geological history. The Paleoproterozoic or older basement identified with the age of ca. 2560 Ma showed granulite facies metamorphism which mainly had an assemblage of gneissic amphibolite, charnockite and granulite. = Baoban Group = The Baoban Group generally showed greenschist and amphibolite facies metamorphism which could also be separately identified as the Upper Ewenling Formation and the Lower Gezhencun Formation. During Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic, the Island was in a spreading arc basin system. The rifting provided a depositional environment for the Baoban Group in ca. 1800‚Äì1450 Ma. It was then intruded by Mesoproterozoic granites at ca. 1450‚Äì1430 Ma. This was evidenced by the protolith of the Group, being interlayers of clastic-sedimentary rocks, pyroclastic and volcanic rocks which were mafic to intermediate in nature. The regional metamorphism experienced by the Baoban Group was caused by the South China Jinningian event in which the Cathaysia Block fused with the Yangtze Block in Late Mesoproterozoic. The event also led to deposition of Shilu Group and Shihuiding Formation. = Shilu Group and Shihuiding Formation = Precambrian Environment in Hainan Island The Shilu Group was composed of siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary rocks from shallow oceanic rifting environment with low grade metamorphism. Conformably lying above the Shilu Group was the Shihuiding Formation which was generally low-grade, siliciclastic rocks deposited in foreland basin. The sedimentation took place in the period between Late Mesoproterozoic and Early Neoproterozoic. The rocks were then regionally metamorphosed in the late South China Jinningian event.  Paleozoic (251‚Äì542 million years ago)  = Cambrian (488‚Äì542 million years ago) = The Cambrian rocks are exposed in the Southern Hainan Island which was composed of fine-grained shale and limestone deposited in shallow oceanic and coastal environment. In this layer of rocks, trilobite fossils were identified that when comparing them with those discovered in Queensland, Australia, geologists found the two were actually associated with each other, hence this relationship is used to prove for the tectonic movement of Hainan Island at this geological time. This shows that after the break up of Rodinia at the end of Neoproterozoic, Hainan Island as part of the South China Block drifted towards the Australian continental plate, resulting in a comparable trilobite fossils record in both places. At the stage of Rodinia breakup, the Cathaysia Block and the Yangtze Block were drifted apart. = Ordovician (423-488 million years ago) = Ordovician rocks from the Northern and Southern Hainan Island show different characteristics. Rocks in the southern areas were sedimentary rocks deposited at the landward side of a coast, with distinctive features of having different grain sizes from black shale, lithic sandstone to conglomerate, as well as having both siliciclastic sedimentary rocks and limestones. On the other hand, Ordovician rocks found in the northern areas were interlayers of fine-grained siliciclastic rocks deposited in marine environment, extrusive igneous and pyroclastic rocks. The volcaniclastic rocks were exhibiting low-grade metamorphism. These Ordovician rocks lied on top of the Cambrian rocks without unconformity. = Silurian (416‚Äì423 million years ago) = Continuous rock records were found from Ordovician to Silurian Periods. Silurian rocks were mainly composed of interlayers of tuffaceous rocks and fine-grained clastic rocks formed in marine environment. The rocks were metamorphosed in which some showed phyllitic characteristics. As in Cambrian, the Cathaysia Block and the Yangtze Block were drifted apart at the stage of Rodinia breakup. During Middle Ordovician to Late Silurian, these two previously drifted apart blocks were collided with each other again, forming the large South China Block. This event is referred as the South China Caledonian orogeny which probably took place in 430‚Äì400 Ma. There exhibited an angular unconformity in high angles between the Silurian rocks and the Carboniferous rocks in which the Devonian units were missing. = Carboniferous and Permian (251‚Äì359 million years ago) = Subduction in Late Paleozoic Above the angular unconformity, the Carboniferous and Permian units lied conformably with each other, both having similar characteristics in the rock layers. They showed low-grade metamorphism in siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary rocks deposited in shallow to deep marine environment with fine-to-medium grain size. Also, there were granites (syenogranites and monzogranites) intruded at the age of ca. 300‚Äì250 Ma. They were generally seen with foliations as well. In Northern Hainan, there is a prominent fault, the Changjiang-Qionghai fault, along which shows the traces where the oceanic basin rifted apart under consistent extension in Late Paleozoic. The Cambrian and Permian units were then deposited in the basin. Also, it is suggested that from the Late Devonian to Permian, Hainan Island as part of the South China Block drifted towards the Southeast Asian crustal plate in the north, breaking away from the East Gondwana. As a result, there was an unconformity between the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic units.  Mesozoic (65.5‚Äì251 million years ago)  At around ca. 250 Ma, the oceanic basin was closed that the Paleo-Tethyan oceanic crust disappeared and the supercontinent Pangea was shaped. The two massive masses adjacent to the oceanic basin then collided towards each other, forming Shilu m√©lange. = Triassic (200‚Äì251 million years ago) = There are few traces of Early Triassic units found in Hainan Island. The rocks showed a range of grain sizes from fine-grained materials, such as siltstones and argillites, to detritus-bearing sandstones to course-grained materials such as conglomerates. This suggested a foreland basin as its depositional environment. At the same time, there was also intrusive activities at Early Mesozoic ca. 250‚Äì200 Ma, majorly producing granites (syenogranites and monzogranites). = Jurassic and Cretaceous (65.5‚Äì200 million years ago) = Back-arc Rifting System in Middle Mesozoic In Middle-Jurassic, Hainan Island was in place at the back-arc rifting system. Until Early Cretaceous, the Paleo-pacific oceanic plate was then subducted under the South China Block in the northwest. As a result, the intrusive activities took place frequently as well. The granitoids produced in Jurassic, ca. 173‚Äì150 Ma, had similar composition with those produced in Triassic. The Cretaceous units are well exposed on Hainan Island. It can be divided into five stratigraphical units according to the geological sequence. The rocks were mainly igneous in nature, including granites, andesites, dacites, rhyolites, mafic dykes, etc. It is researched that the granitoid intrusive rocks had an age of ca. 131‚Äì73 Ma. Under the continuous extension system, there were large-scale volcanisms taken place during Late Cretaceous to Cenozoic.  Cenozoic (present‚Äì65.5 million years ago)  In Cenozoic, South China Sea was opened, placing Hainan Island in the environment with large- scale volcanisms. As a result, volcanic rocks, typically basalt, are the most prominent rock type in this period of time which are now mainly exposed in the northern part of the Island. Return to Top ‚Üë  Structure  Two main sets of faults in Hainan Island, one trending east, while the other trends northeast There are dominantly two sets of fault system existed in Hainan Island, one set was trending east and the other was trending northeast. Wangwu-Wenchang fault, Changjiang-Qionghai fault, Jianfeng-Diaoluo fault and Jiusuo-Lingshui fault are the major east-trending faults, while Gezhen shear fault and Baisha fault are the dominant northeast-trending faults on the Island. Each of the faults has its own geological influence to the present rock unit distributions and structures. For example, with the formation of Gezhen shear fault in South China Jinningian event, the Precambrian rock units were exposed in the Western Hainan Island. Changjiang-Qionghai fault recorded the rifting of the oceanic basin in Late Paleozoic. Regarding the Gezhen shear fault, it transformed from ductile shearing in the beginning to brittle-ductile and finally to brittle shearing through several tectonic events. To be specific, it was ductile in nature during the South China Caledonian orogeny in which the large South China Block was formed. It then became brittle-ductile in nature in Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic when the Paleo-Tethyan oceanic basin was closed. At last, the Gezhen shear fault transformed to brittle shearing in Late Mesozoic. Return to Top ‚Üë  Ore deposits  Due to the multiple stages of granitoid emplacements through its geological history, they have made Hainan Island rich in various types of ore deposits, including gold, molybdenum, lead, zinc, silver, etc. Here will highlight the formation of gold and molybdenum deposits. It is verified that Hainan Island processes more than 143 tons of gold deposits which are formed in Mesozoic Era in response to the subduction of Paleotethys oceanic plate and its subsequence intrusion of granitoids. The deposits are generally found along the detachment faults that are closely related to folding and deformation on the Island, while they are hosted by the metamorphosed volcanoclastic rocks ranging from the Precambrian to Paleozoic Era. Hainan Island is also an important producer of molybdenum. The molybdenum deposits are generally formed by the granitoid emplacements during Cretaceous Period. According to the chemical analysis of the deposits, they can be further divided into three stages of depositions. Return to Top ‚Üë  Present geological activities  In general, there are still some small earthquakes happening on the Island in present days. It is recorded by the Global Positioning System that there is a horizontal movement of the island in southeast direction at a rate of around 4.01 to 6.70 mm per year, while the vertical movement causing the island to uplift is at an overall rate of 2.4 mm per year. Different parts of the Island have different velocities in vertical movements. In the northern part of Hainan Island, there were approximately 100 volcanoes producing lava which covered more than 4000 km2 of the area mainly in Quaternary and some in Tertiary Period. At present, the volcanos are estimated to be inactive.

In conventional plate tectonics theory, an oceanic plate subducts under another plate and new oceanic crust is generated somewhere else, commonly along the other side of the same plates However, in divergent double subduction, the oceanic plate subducts on two sides. This results in the closure of ocean and arc-arc collision. This concept was first proposed and applied to the Lachlan fold belt in southern Australia. Since then, geologists have applied this model to other regions such as the Solonker Suture Zone of the Central Asian Orogenic belt, the Jiangnan Orogen, the Lhasa‚ÄìQiangtang collision zone and the Baker terrane boundary. Active examples of this system are 1) the Molucca Sea Collision Zone in Indonesia, in which the Molucca Sea plate subducts below the Eurasian plate and the Philippine Sea plate on two sides, and 2) the Adria microplate in the Central Mediterranean, subducting both on its western side (beneath the Apennines and Calabria) and on its eastern side (beneath the Dinarides). Note that the term \\"divergent\\" is used to describe one oceanic plate subducting in different directions on two opposite sides. It should not be confused with use of the same term in 'divergent plate boundary' which refers to a spreading center that separates two plates moving away from each other.  Evolution of divergent double subduction system  The complete evolution of a divergent double subduction system can be divided into four major stages.  Initial stage  As the central oceanic plate subducts on both sides into the two overriding plates, the subducting oceanic slab brings fluids down and the fluids are released in the mantle wedge. This initiates the partial melting of the mantle wedge and the magma eventually rise into the overriding plates, resulting in the formation of two volcanic arcs on the two overriding plates. At the same time, sediment deposits on the two margins of the overriding plates, forming two accretionary wedges. As the plate subducts and rollback occurs, the ocean becomes narrower and the subduction rate reduces as the oceanic plate becomes closer to an inverted \\"U\\" shape. Initial stage: The oceanic plate subducts on both side, forming two parallel arcs and accretionary wedges with opposing direction.  Second stage  The ocean is closed eventually as subduction continues. The two overriding plates meet, collide, and weld together by a \\"soft\\" collision. The inverted \\"U\\" shape of the oceanic plate inhibits the continued subduction of the plate because the mantle material below the plate is trapped. Second stage: Closure of ocean basin and the soft collision of two overriding plates  Third stage  The dense oceanic plate has a high tendency to sink. As it sinks, it breaks along the oceanic plate and the welded crust above and a gap is created. The extra space created leads to the decompression melting of mantle wedge materials. The melts flow upward and fill the gap and intrude the oceanic plate and welded crust as mafic dykes intrusion. Eventually, the oceanic plate completely breaks apart from the welded crust as it continues to sink. Third stage: Detachment of oceanic plate resulting in partial melting of mantle and lower crust  Final stage  When the oceanic plate breaks apart from the crust and sinks into the mantle, underplating continues to occur. At the same time, the sinking oceanic plate starts to dewater and release the fluids upward to aid the partial melting of mantle and the crust above. It results in extensive magmatism and bimodal volcanism. Final stage: Continued sinking of the oceanic crust. Partial melting of mantle and lower crust continue to drive intrusion and volcanism. The volcanic and sedimentary rocks deposit uncomformably on the accretionary complex. Dashed lines with arrow show poloidal mantle flow induced by slab rollback.  Magmatic and metamorphic features   Arc magmatism  Unlike one sided subduction where only one magmatic arc is generated on the overriding plate, two parallel magmatic arcs are generated on both colliding overriding plates when the oceanic plate subducts on two sides. Volcanic rocks indicating arc volcanism can be found on both sides of the suture zone. Typical rock types include calc-alkaline basalt, andesites, dacite and tuff. These arc volcanic rocks are enriched in Large Ion Lithophile Element (LILE) and Light Rare Earth Element (LREE) but depleted in niobium, hafnium and titanium.  Extensive intrusions  Partial melting of mantle generate mafic dykes intrusion. Because the mantle is the primary source, these dykes record isotopic characteristics of the depleted mantle in which the 87Sr/86Sr ratio is near 0.703 and ŒµNd is positive. On the other hand, partial melting of the lower crust (accretionary complex) leads to S-type granitoids intrusion with enriched aluminum oxide throughout the evolution of divergent double subduction.  Bimodal volcanism  When the oceanic plate detaches from the overlying crust, intense decompressional melting of mantle is induced. Large amount of hot basaltic magma intrude and melt the crust which generate rhyolitic melt. It results in alternating eruption of basaltic and rhyolitic lava.  Low grade metamorphism  Without continental collision and deep subduction, high grade metamorphism is not common like other subduction zones. Most of the sedimentary strata and volcanics in the accretionary wedge experience low to medium grade metamorphism up to greenschist or amphibolite facies only.  Structural features   Thrusting and folding  Schematic cross section showing modern example of divergent double subduction system in Molucca Sea Collision Zone, Indonesia. The Sangihe arc is overriding the Halmahera Arc and accretionary complex is formed on forearc of Halmahera Arc When the two overriding plates converge, two accretionary wedges will develop. The two accretionary wedges are in opposite direction. Thus, direction of thrust and vergence of the folds in the accretionary wedges are opposite also. However, this proposed feature may not be observed because of the continuous deformation. For example, in the modern day example of Molucca Sea Collision Zone, the continuous active collision causes the Sangihe Arc to override the Halmahera Arc and the back arc of Halmahera Arc to overthrust itself. In this case, complex fold thrust belt including the accretionary complex is formed. In future, the Sangihe Arc will override the Halmahera Arc and rock records in Halmahera will disappear.  Unconformity  When the two overriding plates collide and the ocean basin is closed, sedimentation ceases. Sinking of the oceanic plate drag down the welded crust to form a basin that allows continued sedimentation. After the oceanic plate completely detaches from the crust above, isostatic rebound occurs, leaving a significant unconformity in the sedimentary sections.  Factors controlling the evolution of divergent double subduction system  In nature, the inverted \\"U\\" shape of the oceanic plate in divergent double subduction should not be always perfectly symmetrical like the idealized model. An asymmetrical form is preferred like the real example in Molucca Sea where the length of the subducted slab is longer on its western side beneath the Sangihe Arc while a shorter slab on its eastern side beneath the Halmahera Arc. 3D numerical modelling had been done to simulate divergent double subduction, to evaluate different factors that can affect the evolution and geometry of the system discerned below.  Width of the oceanic plate  thumb328x328px Torodial flow of slab trapped mantle at the edge of the oceanic plate The width of the plate determines whether the divergent double subduction can be sustained. The inverted \\"U\\" shape of the oceanic plate is not an effective geometry for it to sink because of the mantle materials beneath. Those mantle materials need to escape by toroidal flow at the edge of the subducted oceanic plate. With a narrow oceanic plate (width < 2000 km), the trapped mantle beneath the oceanic plate can effectively escape by toroidal flow. In contrast, for a persistent oceanic plate (width > 2000 km), the trapped mantle beneath the oceanic plate cannot escape effectively by toroidal flow and the system cannot be sustained. Therefore, divergent double subduction can only occur in small narrow oceanic plate but not in large width oceanic plate. This also explains why it is rare in nature and most subduction zones are single sided.  Order of subduction  Order of subduction control the geometry of divergent doubled subduction. The side that begins to subduct earlier enters the eclogitization level earlier. The density contrast between the plate and the mantle increases which makes the sinking of the plate faster, creating a positive feedback. It results in an asymmetrical geometry where the slab length is longer on the side which subducts earlier. The slab pull, amount of poloidal flow and the rate of convergence on the side with shorter length will be reduced. It should be note that it remains unclear how initiation occurs for both sides of a single plate if subduction is in form of divergent double subduction, even though this subduction type has been clearly observed . This is because it's difficult to break a moving oceanic plate (i.e., acting as a trailing edge, which moving in the reverse direction of the ongoing , earlier-initiated subduction) due to lack of compression required for forced (induced) subduction initiation . Therefore, self-consistent initiation of divergent double subduction, together with other forms of double subduction, requires further studies of structural and magmatic records.  State of motion of the overriding plates  The state of motion of overriding plates control the geometry of divergent doubled subduction and the position of collision. The length of the subducting slab beneath a stagnant overriding plate is shorter because the mantle flow is weaker and the subduction is slower. In contrast, the length of the subducting slab beneath a free moving plate is longer. Additionally, the position of collision is shifted more to the side with stagnant plate as the rollback is faster on the free moving side.  Thickness of the overriding plates  Thickness of the overriding plates have similar effect as state of motion of overriding plates to control the geometry of divergent doubled subduction and the position of collision. A thicker overriding plate hinders subduction because of the larger friction. It results in a shorter slab. Vice versa, a thinner overriding plate have a longer slab.  Density contrast between oceanic plate and mantle  Larger density contrast between oceanic plate and mantle create a larger negative buoyancy of the oceanic plate. It results in a faster subduction and a stronger rollback. Therefore, the mantle flow induced by the rollback (poloidal flow) is also enhanced. The convergence rate is increased, resulting in a faster and more vigorous collision between the two overriding plates.

With a commonly accepted half-life of 37.1 billion years, the long-living Lu‚ÄìHf decay pair survives through geological time scales, thus is useful in geological studies. Due to chemical properties of the two elements, namely their valences and ionic radii, Lu is usually found in trace amount in rare-earth element loving minerals, such as garnet and phosphates, while Hf is usually found in trace amount in zirconium-rich minerals, such as zircon, baddeleyite and zirkelite. The trace concentration of the Lu and Hf in earth materials posed some technological difficulties in using Lu‚ÄìHf dating extensively in the 1980s. With the use of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP‚ÄìMS) with multi-collector (also known as MC‚ÄìICP‚ÄìMS) in later years, the dating method is made applicable to date diverse earth materials. The Lu‚ÄìHf system is now a common tool in geological studies such as igneous and metamorphic rock petrogenesis, early earth mantle- crust differentiation, and provenance.  Radiometric dating  Lutetium is a rare-earth element, with one naturally-occurring stable isotope 175Lu and one naturally-occurring radioactive isotope 176Lu. When 176Lu atoms are incorporated into earth materials, such as rocks and minerals, they began to be \\"trapped\\" while starting to decay. Through radioactive decay, an unstable nucleus decays into another relatively stable one. Radiometric dating makes use of the decay relationship to calculate how long the atoms have been \\"trapped\\", i.e. the time since the earth material was formed.  Decay of 176Lu  The only natural occurring radioactive isotope of lutetium ^{176}_{71}Lu decays in the following two ways: :^{176}_{71}Lu -> {^{176}_{72}Hf} + e^- :{^{176}_{71}Lu} + e^- -> {^{176}_{70}Yb} Lutetium,^{176}_{71}Lu can decay into, ^{176}_{72}Hf , a heavier element, or ytterbium, ^{176}_{70}Yb , a lighter element. However, as the major mode of decay is by Œ≤‚àí emission, i.e. release of electron (e‚àí), as in the case for^{176}_{71}Lu decaying to ^{176}_{72}Hf , the presence of^{176}_{70}Yb is of negligible effect to Lu‚ÄìHf age determination.Original figure 2 from Debaille et al. (2017); An example of Lu/Hf isochron.  Decay constant determination  The decay constant of ^{176}Lu can be obtained through direct counting experiments and by comparing Lu‚ÄìHf ages with other isotope system ages of samples whose ages are determined. The commonly accepted decay constant has the value of 1.867 (¬± 0.007) √ó 10‚àí11 yr‚àí1. However, there remain discrepancies on the value of decay constant.  Age determination  An age equation is set up for every radiometric dating technique to describe the mathematical relationship of the number of parent and daughter nuclide. In Lu‚ÄìHf system, the parent would be Lu (the radioactive isotope) and Hf as the daughter nuclide (the product after radioactive decay). The age equation to Lu‚ÄìHf system is as follows: : \\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{176}Hf}\\\\ce{^{177}Hf}\\\\right) = \\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{176}Hf}\\\\ce{^{177}Hf}\\\\right)_i + \\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{176}Lu}\\\\ce{^{177}Hf}\\\\right)(e^{\\\\lambda t}-1) where: * (^{176}Hf/^{177}Hf) is the measured ratio of the two isotopes of the sample. * (^{176}Hf/^{177}Hf)_i is the initial ratio of the two isotopes when the sample is formed. * (^{176}Lu/^{177}Hf) is the measured ratio of the two isotopes of the sample. * is the decay constant of ^{176}Lu. * t is the time since the sample is formed. The two isotopes, 176Lu and 176Hf, in the system are measured as ratio to the reference stable isotope of 177Hf. The measured ratio can be obtained from mass spectrometry. A common practice for geochronological dating is to establish an isochron plot. Multiple set of data would be measured and plotted with 176Hf/177Hf on y-axis and 176Lu/177Hf on x-axis. A linear relationship would be obtained. The initial ratio can either be assumed to be natural isotopic abundance ratio or, for a better approach, obtained from the y-intercept of plotted isochron. The slope of the plotted isochron would represent (e^{\\\\lambda t}-1).  Epsilon (…õHf value)  …õHf value is an expression of ^{176}Hf/^{177}Hf ratio of a sample with respect to ^{176}Hf/^{177}Hf ratio of chondritic uniform reservoir. The usage of …õHf value is a common practice in Hf studies. …õHf has a range of value from +15 to -70 at present. …õHf is expressed in the following equation: : \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\ce{Hf}(0)} = \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{176}Hf}\\\\ce{^{177}Hf}\\\\right)_{\\\\ce{sample}(0)}}{\\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{176}Hf}\\\\ce{^{177}Hf}\\\\right)_{\\\\ce{CHUR}(0)}} - 1\\\\right] \\\\times 10\\\\,000 where: * \\"0\\" in the bracket denoting time = 0, meaning present day.

For t = 0, it represent the ratio at present. * \\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{176}Hf}\\\\ce{^{177}Hf}\\\\right)_{\\\\ce{CHUR}} is the Hf-176 to Hf-177 ratio in the chondritic uniform reservoir. For t = 0, it represent the ratio at present.  Geochemistry of lutetium and hafnium  242x242px According to the Goldschmidt classification scheme, Lu and Hf are both lithophile (earth-loving) elements, meaning they are mainly found in the silicate fraction of Earth, i.e. the mantle and crust. During the formation of the Earth, the two elements tended not be fractionated into the core during core formation, i.e. not concentrated in the core, unlike siderophile elements (iron-loving elements). Lu and Hf are also refractory elements, meaning they quickly condensed from the protoplanetary disk to form the solid part of Earth, as opposed to volatile elements. The two elements as a result would not be found in Earth's early atmosphere. Due to these characteristics, the two elements are relatively stationary throughout planetary evolution and are thought to retain the isotopic abundance characteristics of primitive planetary material, i.e. chondritic uniform reservoir (CHUR). Both Lu and Hf are incompatible trace elements and relatively immobile. However, Hf is more incompatible than Lu, and thus it is relatively enriched in the crust and in silicate melts. Thus, a higher Lu/Hf ratio (also meaning a higher 176Hf / 177Hf ratio) is generally found in the residual solid during partial melting and removal of a liquid from a geochemical reservoir. It is worth noting that variation in Lu/Hf ratio is usually very small.  …õHf value implications  …õHf values are closely related to the enrichment or depletion of Hf relative to the chondritic uniform reservoir. A positive …õHf value means that 176Hf concentration in sample is larger than that of chondritic uniform reservoir. This also means a higher Lu/Hf ratio in sample. Positive value would be found in the residue solid after melt extraction, as the liquid would be enriched in Hf. It is worth noting that the enrichment of Hf in melt would means removing the more abundant isotopes of Hf to a larger extent than 176Hf, resulting in the observed 176Hf/177Hf enrichment in residue solid. Using the same logic, a negative …õHf value would represent the extracted melt from reservoir, forming an evolved, juvenile material. The original figure 9 from Rehman et al. (2012) showed an intermedia, mixed …õHf trend for the eclogites that was studied. The experimental result indicate that the eclogites were formed from ocean-island basalt with contamination from sediments to produce the intermediate …õHf values. Original figure 9 from Rehman et al. (2012); An example of …õHf plot.none  CHUR model age  The chondritic uniform reservoir model age is the age at which the material, from which rock and mineral forms, leaves the chondritic uniform reservoir, i.e. the mantle, when assuming the silicate earth retained chemical signature of chondritic uniform reservoir. As described in previous section, melting will cause a fractionation of Lu and Hf in the melt and residue solid, thus resulting in Lu/Hf and Hf/Hf values deviating from chondritic uniform reservoir values. The time or age at which the Lu/Hf and Hf/Hf values from the sample and chondritic uniform reservoir matches is the chondritic uniform reservoir model age. : t_\\\\ce{CHUR} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right) \\\\ln \\\\left[1 + \\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{176}Hf}\\\\ce{^{177}Hf}\\\\right)_\\\\text{sample(0)} - \\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{176}Hf}\\\\ce{^{177}Hf}\\\\right)_\\\\text{CHUR(0)}}{\\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{176}Lu}\\\\ce{^{177}Hf}\\\\right)_\\\\text{sample(0)} - \\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{176}Lu}\\\\ce{^{177}Hf}\\\\right)_\\\\text{CHUR(0)}}\\\\right] where: * \\"0\\" in the bracket denoting time = 0, meaning present day. * t CHUR is the chondritic uniform reservoir model age. * Œª is the decay constant. * \\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{176}Hf}\\\\ce{^{177}Hf}\\\\right)_{\\\\ce{sample}} is the Hf-176 to Hf-177 ratio in the sample. * \\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{176}Hf}\\\\ce{^{177}Hf}\\\\right)_{\\\\ce{CHUR}} is the Hf-176 to Hf-177 ratio in the chondritic uniform reservoir.  Lu/Hf and Hf/Hf ratios of CHUR  The chondritic uniform reservoir model are tightly constrained in order to use Lu‚ÄìHf system for age determination. Chondrites represent primitive materials from solar nebula which later accrete to form planetesimals, and to further extent meaning the primitive undifferentiated Earth. Chondritic uniform reservoir are used to model the chemistry of the silicate layers of Earth as these layers were unaffected by planetary evolution processes. To characterise the chondritic uniform reservoir composition in terms of Lu and Hf, chondrites of different petrological types are used for analysing Lu and Hf concentrations. However, discrepancies of ^{176}Lu/^{177}Hf and ^{176}Hf/^{177}Hf ratios remain. Earlier studies experimented on chondrites of all petrologic types. The ^{176}Lu/^{177}Hf ratios yielded varies by 18%, or even by 28%. The ^{176}Hf/^{177}Hf ratios yielded varies by 14 …õHf units. One later study focused on chondrites of petrological types 1 to 3, which are unequilibrated, show variation of 3% in ^{176}Lu/^{177}Hf ratios, and 4 …õHf units in ^{176}Hf/^{177}Hf ratios.  Analytical methods  In the earliest years, at around the 1980s, age acquisition based on Lu‚ÄìHf system make use of chemical dissolution of sample and thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS). Generally, rock samples are powered and treated with HF and HNO3 in a Teflon bomb. The bomb is put in oven at 160 ¬∞C for four days. Following that comes acids treatment for purification from major elements and other undesirable trace elements. Different studies may use slightly different protocols and procedures, but all are trying to ensure complete dissolution of Lu and Hf bearing materials. The technique of isotope dilution is often necessary for precise determination of concentrations. Isotope dilution is done by adding materials of known concentration of Lu and Hf into the dissolved samples. The samples can then go through TIMS for data acquisition. The above sample preparation procedures prevent convenient analysis of Lu‚ÄìHf, thus limiting its usage in the 1980s. Also, the age determination using TIMS require samples of high Lu and Hf concentration to be successful. However, common mineral phases have low concentrations of Lu and Hf, which again limits Lu‚ÄìHf uses. The most common analytical methods for Lu‚ÄìHf determination nowadays is by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP‚ÄìMS). ICP‚ÄìMS, with multi-collector, allow precision determination with materials with low Hf concentration, such as apatite and garnet. The amount of sample needed for determination is also smaller, facilitating utilization of zircon for Lu‚ÄìHf ages. Selective dissolution, i.e. dissolving the garnet but leaving the refractory inclusions intact, is applied to the Lu‚ÄìHf system.  Applications   Igneous rock petrogenesis  Lu‚ÄìHf isotope system can provide information on where and when a magmatic body originate. By applying Hf concentration determination to zircons from A-type granites in Laurentia, …õHf values ranging from ‚àí31.9 to ‚àí21.9 were obtained, representing a crustal melt origin. Apatite has also promising Lu‚ÄìHf information, as apatite has high Lu content relative to Hf content. In cases where rocks are silica-poor, if more evolved rocks of the same magmatic origin can be identified, apatite could provide high Lu/Hf ratio data to produce accurate isochron, with an example from Sm√•lands Taberg, southern Sweden, where apatitie Lu/Hf age of 1204.3¬±1.8 million yr was identified as the lower boundary of a 1.2 billion yr magmatic event that caused the Fe‚ÄìTi mineralization at Sm√•lands Taberg.  Metamorphic rock petrogenesis and metamorphic events  250x250px In understanding metamorphic rocks, Lu‚ÄìHf can still provide information of origin. In cases where zircon phase is absent or very low in abundance, such as eclogite with cumulate protolith, kyanite and orthopyroxene eclogites can be candidate for Hf analysis. Although the overall rare-earth element concentration is low is the two eclogites, Lu/Hf ratios is high, therefore enabling concentration determination of Lu and Hf. Garnets play an important role in Lu/Hf applications, as they are common metamorphic minerals while having high affinity to rare-earth element. This means garnets generally have high Lu/Hf ratios. Dating of garnets with Lu‚ÄìHf could provide information of history of garnet growth during prograde metamorphism and peak P-T conditions. With the help of garnet Lu/Hf ages, a study on Lago di Cignana, western Alps, Italy, an age of 48.8¬±2.1 million yr for lower boundary of garnet growth time was identified. From this, the burial rate of ultra-high-pressure rocks at Lago di Cignana was estimated to be 0.23‚Äì0.47 cm/yr, which suggest ocean floor rocks were carried down to subduction and reached ultra-high-pressure metamorphism conditions. Conventional isochron ages are obtained from bulk garnet separates and are only an estimate of the average age of the overall growth of garnet. To give precise estimates of the pace of growth of a single garnet crystal, geochronologists use microsampling methods to collect and date small consecutive zones of garnet crystals. Another low-temperature, high-pressure metamorphic index mineral, lawsonite was brought into use in recent years to understand subduction metamorphism using Lu/Hf dating. A study showed that lawsonite could be significant in dating low-temperature metamorphic rocks, typically in prograde metamorphism in a subduction zone settings, as garnets are formed after lawsonite is stabilized, so that lawsonite can be enriched in Lu for radiometric dating.  Early Earth mantle-crust differentiation  The crust formation process is supposedly chemically depleting the mantle, as crust forms from partial melts originating from the mantle. However, the process and extent of depletion could not be concluded based on a few isotope characteristics, as some isotope systems are thought to be susceptible to re- setting by metamorphism. To further constrain the modelling of depleted mantle, Lu‚ÄìHf information from zircons are useful, as zircons are resistant to Lu‚ÄìHf re-equilibrating.  Detrital zircon and provenance  Oslo Rift, also known as Oslo Graben. Hf ages determined from detrital zircon can help to identify major event of crustal growth. By analyzing detrital zircon in Yangtze River sediments, a group of researchers produced a statistical distribution of Hf model ages of the sediments. The statistical peaks of age ranges were identified: 2000 Ma‚Äì1200 Ma, 2700 Ma‚Äì2400 Ma, and 3200 Ma-2900 Ma, indicating crustal growth events at ages of Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic, and of Archean in the South China Block. Hf ages from detrital zircon also help tracing sediment source. A study on detrital zircon from sandstones in the Oslo Rift, Norway identified major sediment source in Fennoscandia region and also a minor source in Variscan Mountains of central Europe during Late Devonian to Late Carboniferous by U‚ÄìPb and Lu‚ÄìHf characteristics of source rocks and sediments.

It is a member of Zygomycota and considered the most important species in the genus Rhizopus. It is one of the most common fungi in the world and has a global distribution although it is most commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a common agent of decomposition of stored foods. Like other members of the genus Rhizopus, R. stolonifer grows rapidly, mostly in indoor environments. History This fungus was first discovered by the German scientist Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in 1818 as Rhizopus nigricans. The name was changed in 1902 to Rhizopus stolonifer by the French mycologist J. P. Vuillemin. Habitat and ecology Rhizopus stolonifer is a worldwide distributed species. It is found on all types of mouldy materials. It is often one of the first molds to appear on stale bread. It can exist in the soil as well as in the air. A variety of natural substrata are colonized by this species because R. stolonifer can tolerate broad variations in the concentration of essential nutrients and can use carbon and nitrogen combined in diverse forms. In the laboratory, this fungus grows well on different media, including those that contain ammonium salts or amino compounds. However, R. stolonifer will not grow on Czapek‚Äôs agar (CZA) because it cannot utilize nitrogen in the form of nitrate.Rhizopus lives in hyphae and matured spores  Growth and physiology  Gem-shaped sporangiospores of R. stolonifer showing characteristic striations.This species is known as a saprotroph and plays an important role in the early colonization of substrata in soil. Nonetheless, it can also behave as a parasite of plant tissues causing a rot of vegetables and fruits. Like other species of Rhizopus, R. stolonifer grows rapidly and spreads by means of the stolons. The stolons provide an aerial structure for the growth of the mycelium and the occupation of large areas. They can climb vertically as well as horizontally. Sporangiophores of R. stolonifer can be up to 2.5 mm long and about 20 Œºm in diameter. The spores are shaped differently depending on the available nutrients. They can be ovate, polygonal or angular. The optimal temperature for growth varies between 25-30 ¬∞C. The thermal death point, which is defined as the lowest temperature that can kill all cells in ten minutes, is 60 ¬∞C. Rhizopus stolonifer can grow in acidic environments with a pH of as low as 2.2. The pH range can vary from 2.2 to 9.6. Ultraviolet irradiation can delay spore germination. Reproduction Rhizopus stolonifer can reproduce asexually and sexually. It is a heterothallic species. Sexual reproduction occurs when compatible mating strains are paired, ultimately giving rise to zygospores. The sporangiophore contains both '+' and '‚àí' mating type strains. Meiosis is delayed until the germination of the zygospores. The gametogenia often differ in size, regardless of mating type. This difference in size is not due to sex but presumably due to nutrition. Disease and prevention R. stolonifer colonizing a strawberry. The disease caused by this fungus occurs mainly on ripe fruits, such as strawberries, melon and peach, which are more susceptible to wounds and have a higher sugar content. After a couple of days, the infected fruits become soft and release juices with an acidic odour. When the humidity and temperature are favourable, the mycelial growth occurs rapidly at the surface of the infected fruit and the disease causes the development of long mycelial stolons with black sporangia and spores. When the fungus germinates, it produces different kinds of esterases, including cutinase, which help the fungus to penetrate the plant cell wall. The disease can also affect other adjacent healthy fruits when distributed by wind or insect activity. Some species of Syncephalis can reduce the asexual reproduction of R. stolonifer and therefore may delay or even prevent the post-harvest disease caused by this fungus. Fengycin, which is an anti-fungal complex, also induces the fungal cell death via necrosis and apoptosis. The treatment of sweet potatoes with sodium orthophenyl phenol (Stopmold B) and dichloran (Botran W) have effectively reduced storage rot. Rhizopus stolonifer is an opportunistic agent of disease and hence will only cause infection in people with a weakened immunity. Zygomycosis is the main disease that might be caused by this fungus in humans and while it is not entirely understood yet, this disease is very dangerous and can be fatal. The action of smelling spoiled food may be a source of inhalation exposure to the mold. Importance Rhizopus stolonifer is important economically as an agent of post-harvest storage decay. While Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the most important source of industrial alcohol, R. stolonifer and other species of Rhizopus also produce ethyl alcohol which is the most important fermentation product. Rhizopus stolonifer is also used commercially to manufacture fumaric acid and lactic acid of high purity. The presence of zinc reduces the amount of fumaric acid produced by the fungus.

Her 17-year-old roommate, Ranko Carol Yamada, was also severely wounded, yet survived. The murder caused a significant stir within the Japanese-American community, in part because Yamada alleged that the killer was black, just at the height of violence associated with the Black Panther Party. The killer was never found.Harden, 129  Background  Evelyn Okubo was 18 years old and hailed from the Japanese community of Stockton, California. She and Ranko Carol Yamada had traveled to Chicago as representatives of the Japanese-American youth organization Yellow Seed to the national convention of the JACL, which was then focused on fighting for racial justice and against the war in Vietnam. Prior to the murder, Okubo was believed to have attended racial issue discussion meetings with groups like the Black Panthers and the Young Lords, a Latino community organization with roots as a Chicago turf gang. Harden, 129  Murder  On July 17th, 1970, Okubo was murdered, and Yamada was slashed in the throat, in room 725 of the Palmer House hotel. Yamada, though badly wounded, wrote out several messages: \\"Gory, but it doesn't really hurt,\\" \\"He was a black man with a natural,\\" and \\"Don't blame him it was not his fault. There must be absolute peace.\\" When they were discovered about half an hour later by the third JACL attendee sharing the hotel room, both girls had been stripped naked and bound, though neither showed evidence of being raped. Yamada couldn't speak for two weeks after the incident due to her throat injury, but eventually recounted that the attacker had pranced around naked before killing Okubo.  Aftermath  Chicago newspapers originally ran sensational stories alleging that Okubo was raped prior to being murdered, and implied that interracial dating on the part of the youth activists was to blame. Meanwhile, two police officers were killed by sniper fire from a housing project that same day, while several police and Panthers had been killed the previous year, which added to the supposition that Okubo was killed by a Panther. According to the Chicago Tribune, police named a man named Lonell Robinson as a prime suspect after he was caught raping and robbing another woman in the same hotel. However, he was later ruled out as a suspect, though in the rape case he was indeed convicted the following year. The newspapers also eventually acknowledged that no rape had been committed in Okubo's case, and though some columnists suspected that racial animus was a motive, this has never been confirmed as the perpetrator was never found.Harden, 129 Mabel Okubo, Evelyn's mother, and Carol Yamada later filed a civil suit against the Palmer House, alleging negligence.  Legacy  The tragedy of Okubo's murder was the inspiration for Japanese- American songwriter and musician JoAnne Nobuko Miyamoto, another JACL attendee and West Side Story actress, to write her first song. She and fellow musician Chris Iijima began touring Japanese-American communities, advocating interracial reconciliation and activism while raising money to honor Okubo's memory. Ultimately, they would form the band Yellow Pearl (a pun on Yellow Peril) and become a touchstone in Asian-American media. However, many older Japanese-Americans viewed the murder as confirming their suspicions about the dangers of interracial activism by young Japanese-Americans, and despite the fact that no evidence has been found to support the claim, the belief that the crime was committed by a Black Panther remains prevalent in parts of the community.Harden, 130 See also *Japanese in Chicago *List of unsolved murders  Citations  1970 murders in the United States Asian-American issues Japanese-American civil rights activists Japanese-American history Deaths by person in the United States History of Chicago 1970 in Illinois People murdered in Illinois 20th century in Chicago July 1970 events in the United States Unsolved murders in the United States ","title":"Murder of Evelyn Okubo"},{"id":"55223044","text":"Legislative Assembly elections Kerala References External links * Election Commission of India 1965 State Assembly elections in India State Assembly elections in India ","title":"1965 elections in India"},{"id":"55223069","text":"Helene Pellicano (born 17 April 2002) is a Maltese female junior tennis player.

The novel takes its name from a poem by Constantine P. Cavafy. The novel describes a pilgrimage to India by a young couple, Italian Matteo and German Sophie and the life of a mysterious woman, Laila who runs the ashram where they live and is known there as \\"The Mother\\". The novel further develops a theme that Desai explored in an early short story, Scholar and Gypsy; the difference between the character who feels the world is all we need and the character for whom the world is limited. Settings The book's story takes place in many different places on 4 continents including Lago di Garda, Northern India, Bombay, Cairo, Paris, New York and Holyoke MA. Although the exact time frame of the main story is deliberately unclear, it seems to start in the 1960s and take us into the 1970s. Chapter 3 takes place in the 1920s as we follow Laila (later known as the Mother) from her roots in Cairo on her travels to Europe and America. At the time of the framework story Matteo is seriously ill in the hospital in India and each section before chapter 4 starts with Sophie visiting Matteo. Summary Prologue The story of Matteo and Sophie‚Äôs children staying with their grandparents at Lago di Garda interweaves with the story of Matteo and his sister growing up there and eventually Matteo and Sophie‚Äôs first meeting there at a dinner when she visits with her parents, her father, a German banker who works Matteo‚Äôs industrialist father. Matteo is deep under the influence of his German tutor Fabian who introduced him to Herman Hesse and he is longing to travel east on a spiritual quest. In the present, their children Giacomo and Isabel seem lost in the overbearing environment of the grandparents and can‚Äôt understand why India where they were both born is a bad place for them. Chapter One Sophie and Matteo‚Äôs initial time in India goes awry when Matteo and their new friends start visiting questionable spiritual teachers and Sophie feels almost immediately alienated from that quest. Some spiritual teacher in Bombay leads them on a horrific pilgrimage where they witness the death of a child which turns her off for good. They enter a dismal ashram in Haridwar where Sophie hates the routine and the miserable life style while Matteo takes it all as punishment. The Indians despise the polluted foreigners. Their cultural arrogance and rejection is a complete disillusionment for Sophie but Matteo absorbs and embodies some of their despicable behavior. Once she gets pregnant she is ostracized by the already hostile community and they leave for another ashram ‚Äì to Sophie‚Äôs dismay ‚Äì led by the Mother, which accepts families. Chapter Two As they arrive at the place in the foothills of the Himalayas where the ashram is located, Sophie falls violently ill and is taken to hospital while Matteo enters the ashram alone. Under the care of the refreshingly European Dr Bishop Sophie recovers to bear out her pregnancy but when the baby comes she moves into the family quarters with newborn Giacomo. She lives isolated from the community while Matteo becomes more and more involved eventually working for the Mother, a mysterious older woman who runs the ashram since the Guru‚Äôs passing, as her secretary and works with her on publishing the Master‚Äôs writing. Having a second child does not make things any better and the children end up with their grandparents, first in Germany then in Italy as Sophie sets out on her quest to find out about the true story of the Mother that has taken control of her husband‚Äôs life. Chapter Three Matteo is still sick in the hospital as Sophie tells him she will set off on her quest to learn about the life of the Mother. It starts in Cairo just after World War I where Laila was born as the unruly child of French Egyptian academics. Eventually her parents sent her off to Paris to live with her aunt in a stuffy bourgeois apartment. She finds solace in the oriental shop of Madame Lacan where she reads and learns about India which has an inexplicable attraction for her. When she finds out there will be a dance troupe visiting performing Krishna Lila, she identifies with Lila and convinces the troupe‚Äôs leader Krishna to take her on and train her. The troupe takes her to New York where they live in the uptown apartment of a rich benefactress. But the routine of the shows and the poverty wear her down and she suffers from terrible headaches. One night in Holyoke MA she sneaks away before the performance, travels back to New York but before she can find a job Krishna catches up with her and accepts an offer of free tickets to India to take her home. This entire life journey is traced by Sophie visiting all these places eventually ending alone on the platform of the railway station in Holyoke with no trace of the world Laila knew 45 years ago in sight. Chapter Four Returning to Bombay Sophie has an address where the old Krishna lived and goes there to find out what happened to Laila once she got to India. She receives a package of writing by Laila which tells the story of Laila‚Äôs quest in India and how she came to run the ashram in a gushing stream of narratives and poems that take up most of chapter Four. Epilogue When Sophie returns to the city where the ashram is Matteo is no longer in the hospital. She goes to the ashram to find out the Mother has died and after intense mourning Matteo has decide to travel up north to a place to find enlightenment. In her conversation with Diya, her only friend at the ashram, Sophie admits that she will probably follow him to go look for him. Back to the Garden in Italy, Giacomo returns to the house to tell Nonno and Nonna that he saw his father, Matteo out there. They quickly dismiss him, wanting him to move on with his life, the less said about his parents the better. Only his sister Isabel believes him and share his secret inner world. Notes on the Journey The spiritual quest so famously described in Kavafy‚Äôs poem, quoted here in the beginning of the book, applies to all three of the main characters but, even if the quest is about the journey rather than about reaching the goal of the journey, they all have a miserable time of it. One of the key scenes is when Sophie sees the Mother in her garden sitting by herself and observes how the peacocks come to pay tribute to her, a scene that is echoed later when we find out that Laila was famous for her peacock dance during her time as a dancer. But Sophie is not open to seeing the charismatic power of the older woman and only sees her, sitting alone and vulnerable without her turban, as an inexplicable source of power over Matteo. Matteo is so blinded by his thirst for knowledge, for enlightenment, to get to the goal that he will do anything and sacrifice anything to get there. Sophie‚Äôs quest is for love, choosing her love for her husband over the care of her children. Her quest is also in her attempt to understand the woman who had the power to take him away from her, but at the end she tells Diya, she found ‚Äúnothing much‚Äù. Laila‚Äôs quest is maybe the most passionate of all but it is not clear if her enlightenment brings her true samadhi or just the satisfaction of running a perfectly managed, beautifully kept resort for the spiritually curious. Is it the power that enlightens her or the enlightenment that empowers her? Is her drawing Matteo closer to her a display of that power or an act of grace? There is some suggestion in the Prologue of sexual tension between Matteo and his tutor Fabian. There is also a very odd scene where the children sleep in the same bed and Isabel places Giacomo‚Äôs hand between her legs. None of this is developed or otherwise relevant ‚Äì we are also never quite clear if Laila sleeps with Krishna but one presumes so. Relations between Sophie and Matteo are only described as rather primal and at times aggressive. The sexual repression (or lack of sexuality) adds a dark undercurrent to this rather sinister tale which takes a dim view of the search for enlightenment.

It saw the resignation of Leader Bill Hayden followed by the election of Bob Hawke as his replacement. Background Bill Hayden had been leader of the Labor Party since shortly after the 1977 landslide defeat, and he led the party to a much improved result at the 1980 election. However, after only just surviving a challenge from Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations Bob Hawke, a disappointing by-election result in December 1982 caused many to question his ability to win the impending federal election. With a second challenge from Hawke imminent, Hayden resigned as party leader and Hawke was returned in the caucus ballot unopposed. Elsewhere, Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser had announced a snap election hoping to capitalise on Labor's disunity and go to the polls against Hayden rather than Hawke. Later that afternoon at a press conference, Hayden famously said that \\"a drover's dog could lead the Labor Party to victory, the way the country is\\". The ensuing federal election was easily won by Labor and Hawke became Prime Minister.

Early life Born in Hoxton in the East End of London, he was responsible for minor infractions of the law when young, whereas his brothers Johnny and James were involved in more significant crimes. Along with Johnny, Knight was friendly with the Kray brothers, but, he says, was not connected with their illegal activities. He also had another brother, David and a sister, Patsy. Knight was sentenced to 15 months in prison in 1961 for dealing in stolen goods. The two clubs he ran, the Artistes and Repertoire Club (known as the A&R;) on Charing Cross Road and its neighbour Tin Pan Alley in Soho, were drinking establishments favoured by the criminal underworld. Later criminal trials Zomparelli killing David, Knight's brother, was stabbed to death by Alfredo Zomparelli, who himself was murdered in 1974 after being released following a prison sentence for manslaughter (Zomparelli had pleaded self-defence). After hit-man George Bradshaw confessed to his involvement, and alleged Knight had paid him ¬£1,000 for the task, Knight was arrested for the murder of Zomparelli and tried at the Old Bailey in 1980; Knight was acquitted. In his later Memoirs and Confessions (1998), Knight said he had hired a hit-man, Nicky Gerard, to carry out the killing (Gerard, later also murdered, was acquitted at the same trial as Knight) in payback for the murder of his brother. Under the double jeopardy rules in force at the time, it meant he could not be tried a second time, although Knight again denied responsibility in 2002. Connection to 1983 Security Express robbery Knight spent a decade on the run living in Spain's Costa del Sol, after fleeing on the night his brother was arrested in 1984 for a robbery at a Security Express depot the previous year. John Knight was later imprisoned in June 1985 for 22 years for co-arranging the robbery. Their other surviving brother James was among the other gang members and received eight years for handling stolen money. While evading extradition in Spain, Ronnie Knight ran an Indian restaurant named Mumtaz and an eponymous nightclub, RKnights, the scene of violent crimes including a physical attack upon Knight, but by the mid-1990s, he was in financial difficulties. After returning to Britain in May 1994, Knight was jailed for seven years in January 1995 for handling ¬£300,000 in stolen money from the ¬£6m armed robbery at a Security Express depot in east London in 1983. He said he was not involved in the robbery, and the prosecution counsel Michael Worsley QC agreed the charge should remain on file, but Knight did plead guilty to handling the stolen bank notes. Judge Gerald Gordon said when sentencing Knight: \\"Clearly, I do not know what precise role you played. But professional robbers such as those involved are not going to hand over the sort of sums you got unless the person to whom they give it is very deeply involved himself\\". Personal life Knight left his first wife to marry actress Barbara Windsor in 1964; the couple divorced in 1985. In 1987, Knight married Sue Haylock, his third wife, in Fuengirola.

Ramachandran (M.G.R), the AIADMK founder and a leading Tamil film actor, was sworn in as Chief Minister for the first time. The election was a four cornered contest between the AIADMK, DMK, the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Janata Party. Earlier on 17 October 1972, M.G.R had founded the AIADMK following his expulsion from the DMK after differences arose between him and DMK leader M. Karunanidhi. On 31 January 1976, Karunanidhi's government was dismissed by the central government of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi citing corruption charges against Karunanidhi and President's rule was imposed on the state. Karunanidhi had been at odds with Indira Gandhi over his opposition to Emergency and allied with Janata Party founded by Jayaprakash Narayan. Meanwhile, M.G.R had developed a close relationship with Indira Gandhi and supported the Emergency. M.G.R remained as Chief Minister until his death in 1987, winning the next two elections held in 1980 and 1984.

The Norwegian name literally translates to The Future in Our Hands. The organization is critical of the ever-increasing consumption in rich countries such as Norway, and believes that consideration for nature and climate is more important than growth in consumption and economy. The organization was inspired and founded by Erik Dammann in 1974, and is currently led by Anja Bakken Riise. It has approximately 27,000 members, and thereby is the largest environmental organization in Norway.  Core causes  The organization prioritizes three causes in particular: 1) Fair pay for those who make the products we use in everyday life - such as clothing, food and mobile phones - especially in poor countries. 2) Reduced meat consumption and production: for the sake of environment, public health, and animal welfare. 3) Fossil fuel divestment: shifting investment from the coal, oil and gas industry to renewable energy.

Super Show!. Both songs would later appear on the soundtrack compilation The Aquabats! Super Show! Television Soundtrack: Volume One, released in 2019. Overview Background Composed by Aquabats drummer Richard Falomir (Ricky Fitness) and collaborator Matthew Gorney, \\"Burger Rain\\" was written for The Aquabats' cable television series The Aquabats! Super Show!, where it was featured in the series' premiere episode \\"ManAnt!\\". Within the context of the episode, the villain ManAnt and his minions attack the city's burger restaurants to draw the attention of The Aquabats as part of a ploy to capture bassist Crash McLarson - who has the superpower of growing to enormous size - and harnessing his growth powers to create an army of giant ants. Following ManAnt's defeat, an enlarged McLarson tears open a giant anthill, revealing a massive stash of burgers which he proceeds to shower over his hungry and regular-sized bandmates as they sing the song. Recording, reception and release The version of \\"Burger Rain\\" performed in Super Show! runs for approximately one and a half minutes. In a 2012 interview, series co-creator and lead singer Christian Jacobs (MC Bat Commander) revealed that \\"Burger Rain\\", among other songs written for the show, had been recorded in both full and abbreviated versions in the hope of eventually releasing a soundtrack album. Critical reception to \\"Burger Rain\\"s performance on Super Show! was largely positive, with Wired magazine calling the \\"borderline erotic spoof of Princes 'Purple Rain'\\" as \\"wonderfully strange\\" and ToonZone noting it was \\"exactly as weird and funny as it sounds\\". Almost immediately, \\"Burger Rain\\" became a staple of The Aquabats' live shows, most often performed near the end of their set and often accompanied by the release of large inflatable cheeseburgers. Although The Aquabats' intentions of a full soundtrack had not come to fruition by 2017, on May 11, 2017, the band announced plans to release \\"Burger Rain\\" and \\"Beat Fishin'\\" as a 7\\" single as part of a fan ticket package for an upcoming tour which commenced on July 12 in St. Louis, Missouri. The single version of \\"Burger Rain\\" is an alternate recording, featuring a second and third verse and running three and a half minutes in length. In April 2019, \\"Burger Rain\\" was released to major streaming services as a B-side to the Super Show! song \\"Cobraman Theme!\\". Both songs, as well as \\"Beat Fishin'\\", were widely released on digital and physical media as part of The Aquabats! Super Show! Television Soundtrack: Volume One on June 7, 2019. \\"Beat Fishin\\" The B-side to \\"Burger Rain\\" is \\"Beat Fishin'\\", another song taken from the soundtrack of The Aquabats! Super Show!, specifically the episode \\"Ladyfingers!\\", in which it's played during a party scene. Like \\"Burger Rain\\", the song is an alternate recording extended to full length.

Biography William James Geoffrey Beling was born in Gampola on 22 September 1922, the first son of William Wright Beling II, a Ceylonese watercolorist, and Eleanor Frances Morgan Swan, a music teacher. In 1926 he went to India to study to study architecture and art at Bombay's Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art. In 1928, due to the untimely death of his father, Beling gave up his studies and returned home. He then opened a private art school in Havelock Town and started exhibiting his paintings at the Art Club shows arranged by Charles Freegrove Winzer, Chief Inspector of Art. In 1930 at the Ferguson Hall, Union Place, the photographer Lionel Wendt organised Beling and fellow artist George Keyt's first exhibition. Critics considered the art ‚Äòmanifestly ridiculous and degrading‚Äô, however Pablo Neruda, the Chilean poet, wrote in the Times of Ceylon that \\"true artists are rare in Ceylon. There are two exceptions\\".https://www.facebook.com/events/1591899001138084/ The exhibition also included works by Winzer, to whom Keyt and Beling were pupils. Beling painted mainly landscapes, still-lifes and portraits. According to Albert Dharmasiri, \\"Beling was fascinated by the pictorial innovation of Cubism developed by Braque and Picasso.\\" with his paintings from the early 1930s bearing \\"a striking similarity to those of Keyt in the use of pure colour, simplification of forms to their basic volumes, and the faceting of objects.\\" Winzer wrote, \\"Beling's landscapes are admirably constructed and his handling of the endless variety of greens seen in tropical nature is an achievement in itself. His figures are more angular than those of Keyt, and their movements less varied. Both, however, in their efforts are at one to express volume and construction in their canvasses - qualities in which modern art, in Asia, particularly India, is so deficient\\". In 1932 following Winzer's retirement he was appointed the Chief Inspector of Art, a role in which he actively promoted both western and eastern art in schools throughout the country until he retired in 1967. His duties meant he had less time for his own painting and stopped painting completely around 1945. Beling also prepared the original designs of the Lionel Wendt Memorial Arts Complex in Colombo. In March 2008 'Sketchbook: An Exhibition of the Beling Family to commemorate the 100th birth year of Geoffrey Beling' was hosted at the Sapumal Foundation in Colombo. Along with Beling's works of art, it also showcased sketches and paintings by his father, W. W. Beling. Family Life On 14 May 1941 he married Edith Maria Angela Anthonisz Deutrom (1917-?), the daughter of Percival Lawerence Anthonisz Deutrom and Anna Edith, at the Gospel Tabernacle in Wellawatte. They had four children, Geoffrey Paul (20 July 1942), Christopher David (19 January 1944),Cynthia Ruth (29 November 1945) and Mary Anne (21 October 1959).

The film stars Anna Kendrick as Noelle Kringle, the daughter of Santa Claus. It also stars Bill Hader, Kingsley Ben- Adir, Billy Eichner, Julie Hagerty, and Shirley MacLaine. It was released on November 12, 2019, along with Lady and the Tramp, by Disney+, receiving mixed reviews from critics. Plot In the North Pole, preparations for the upcoming Christmas are quickly taking place. After the current Santa Claus's untimely death five months prior, his son, Nick Kringle, is having difficulties trying to complete his training in order to become the next Santa. His younger sister, Noelle, who has been placed in charge of distributing and maintaining Christmas spirit, continues to support him, and even suggests taking the weekend off as to avoid the stress and relax before the big day. Complying, Nick takes off overnight with the reindeer, and doesn't return following the weekend. When the reindeer return without Nick and Noelle admits to giving him controversial advice, the elves get angry at her. The elf elders forcibly appoint her cousin Gabriel, the Kringle's tech support, to fill in as the new Santa. Guilt-stricken and forlorn, Noelle deduces that Nick fled to Phoenix, Arizona, and takes off with the Sleigh and reindeer alongside her childhood nanny Polly. They set down into a mall. With the permission of manager Helen Rojas and the customer's support and belief that it was a Christmas exhibit, Noelle sets out into the city to find Nick, leaving Polly to tend to the sleigh and reindeer. She meets and hires Jake Hapman, a private investigator as well as a single father who had recently been divorced, to track down Nick. Noelle also interacts with Jake's enthusiastic son Alex and several other people, discovering that she can understand and communicate in other languages (including American Sign Language), as well as tell the naughty from the nice. Jake tracks Nick down to a yoga studio, where Nick is enthusiastic to see Noelle yet cannot make himself return north and become Santa. After a heated argument, Noelle leaves the building. She returns to the mall, where her reindeer friend Snowcone arrives with a letter from Mrs. Claus informing her about the situation back home and ordering her to find and bring Nick back home. During Noelle's time away, Gabriel had used an algorithm to determine that there were only 2,837 \\"nice\\" children in the world, much to the horror of the elves and Mrs. Claus. With help from Snowcone, Noelle tracks down Nick to a yoga retreat at the Desert Botanical Garden, and convinces him to return. After a falling out with Jake at the mall over identity, and an argument between Nick and the mall Santa, Noelle accidentally injures a police officer attempting to break up the argument, is injured, and later hospitalized for psychological evaluation. After a visit from Polly, who reveals her identity as an elf, Jake removes Noelle from the hospital and she makes her way back to the North Pole with Nick, Polly, and the reindeer before Christmas Eve. Back home after a meeting with the elders, Nick nominates Noelle as the next Santa, which stirs up controversy throughout the town but unanimously gains agreement from the elders as she naturally has the skills and there is no rule against a female Santa. Noelle successfully delivers the presents across the world, as well as dropping Jake off at his ex-wife's house to spend time with Alex. The next morning, Gabe happily returns to tech support and Nick establishes a yoga studio in the North Pole. Noelle admits to the audience that she is proud to continue her father's legacy for being the 24th generational Santa, and that Christmas will go on.

Almost all those experiencing a miscarriage experience grief. This event is often considered to be identical to the loss of a child and has been described as traumatic.Lok, I. H., & Neugebauer, R. (2007). Psychological morbidity following miscarriage. Best Practice & Research Clinical Obstetrics & Gynaecology, 21(2), 229-247. \\"Devastation\\" is another descriptor of miscarriage. Grief differs from the emotion sadness.Some thesauruses consider 'sadness' to be a synonym for grief. See Sadness is an emotion along with grief, on the other hand, is a response to the loss of the bond or affection was formed and is a process rather than one single emotional response. Grief is not equivalent to depression. Grief also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, and philosophical dimensions. Bereavement and mourning refer to the ongoing state of loss, and grief is the reaction to that loss. Emotional responses may be bitterness, anxiety, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust and blaming others; these responses may persist for months.Daniel Goleman, Emotional Intelligence (London 1996) p. 271 Self-esteem can be diminished as another response to miscarriage. Not only does miscarriage tend to be a traumatic event, women describe their treatment afterwards to be worse than the miscarriage itself. A miscarriage can often be \\"heart-breaking\\". A miscarriage can affect the women, husband, partner, siblings, grandparents, the whole family system and friends. Almost all those experiencing a miscarriage go through a grieving process. Serious emotional impact is usually experienced immediately after the miscarriage. Some may go through the same loss when an ectopic pregnancy is terminated. In some, the realization of the loss can take weeks. Providing family support to those experiencing the loss can be challenging because some find comfort in talking about the miscarriage while others may find the event painful to discuss. The father of the baby can have the same sense of loss. Expressing feelings of grief and loss can sometimes be harder for men. Some women are able to begin planning their next pregnancy after a few weeks of having the miscarriage. For others, planning another pregnancy can be difficult. Organizations exist that provide information and counselling to help those who have had a miscarriage. Some women have a higher risk of developing prolonged grief and complicated grief than others. Psychological impact Miscarriage has an emotional effect and can also lead to psychological disorders. One discorder that can develop is primary maternal preoccupation. This is defined as a \\" ...'special psychiatric condition' in which the pregnant woman identifies with her baby, highlights the crisis a woman faces when the baby with whom she is preoccupied and identified dies...\\" Grieving manifests itself differently for each woman after miscarriage. It may often go unrecognized. The grief that follows a miscarriage resembles, but is not the same as, the grief experienced after the loss of a family member. Disbelief, depression, anger, and yearning, are described as being a part of the normal grieving process. These reactions remain from three to nine months after the loss. Forty-one percent of parents experience a normal, expected decline in grief in the first two years while 59% were delayed in the resolution of their grief. Grieving can create feelings of loneliness. This grieving has been called a type of psychological trauma. Other serious consequences can develop including depression, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and somatoform disorder. These responses all are associated with grieving after a miscarriage. Some women are able to complete the grieving process a few weeks after the miscarriage and start anticipating their next pregnancy. Planning another pregnancy is traumatic for others. The impact of a miscarriage can be \\"crippling\\" psychologically. Anger can be directed toward those who have had successful pregnancies and children. A woman can grieve the \\"loss of a future child\\" and question her own role as a mother. They may blame themselves or their partner for the miscarriage. Unsuccessful attempts to become pregnant through in vitro fertilization (IVF) can also illicit a similar grief response in women. Those experiencing a late miscarriage may have more significant distress compared to those who have experienced a miscarriage in the first trimester. Even depression can occur. \\"Women today...are aught in a unique historical moment: technology encourages them to form emotional attachments to their pregnancies, but society has not developed traditions to cushion the shock when those attachmets are shattered.\\" Descriptions of the miscarriage are expressed in non-clinical terms by those who have experienced the event. *Angry *Cheated *Despair *Devastating *Drowning *Envy *Guilty *Lack of acknowledgement *Not socially acceptable *Numbness *Pregnancy loss *Shame *Shocked *Sorrow *Stunned Trauma Miscarriage has been found to be a traumatic event and a major loss for women. Pregnancy loss, including induced abortion is a risk factor for mental illness. The impact of miscarriage can be underestimated. The trauma can be compounded if the miscarriage was accompanied by visible and relatively large amounts of blood loss. Bipolar disorders are associated with miscarriage. Depression and bipolar disorder becomes evident after a miscarriage in 43% of women. Some women are more likely to experience complicated and prolonged grief than others. = Mental health = Women experiencing miscarriage are at risk for grief reactions, anxiety or depression. Obsessiveness regarding the miscarriage can develop. Primary maternal preoccupation is also considered a consequence of miscarriage. This condition can occur if a woman who develops a close bond \\"with her baby\\" experiences the loss of the pregnancy. Complicated grief Different grieving \\"styles\\" can exist and vary between individuals. There can be a complete avoidance of dealing with the memories of the miscarriage and there can be an \\"obsessive\\" concentration on an event in the miscarriage. This is in contrast with the expected ability to \\"reminisce about the loss of a loved one\\". Complicated grief differs from the more common form of grief that occurs after a miscarriage. The grieving process associated with other events such as the loss of a spouse or parent is expected to decline in predictable and steady rate. This not true for those experiencing grief after a miscarriage because only 41% follow the expected decline in grief while most, 59% do not fit this pattern. Stress and posttraumatic stress disorder Miscarriage is associated with posttraumatic stress disorder. Risks for developing PTSD after miscarriage are: emotional pain, expressions of emotion, and low levels of social support. Even if relatively low levels of stress occur after the miscarriage, symptoms of PTSD including flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, dissociation and hyperarousal can later develop. The effects of stress can complicate miscarriage. Miscarriage is a stressful event and because stress is a risk factor for subsequent miscarriage, its presence can become part of cycle that continues. Lower stress levels are associated with more favorable outcomes in future pregnancies while higher stress levels increase the risk. Recovery Physical recovery from miscarriage can have an effect on emotional disturbances. The body has to recover from the sudden pregnancy loss. In some instances fatigue is present. Insomnia can be a problem. The miscarriage is very upsetting to the family and can generate very strong emotions. Some women may feel that the miscarriage occurred because they somehow had caused it. Others may blame the father or partner for the miscarriage. Coping with a miscarriage can very greatly between women and families. Some find it difficult to talk about the miscarriage. The narratives of women tend to coincide with quantified and measurable effects. Some women engage in activities that are believed to aid in recovery such as therapy, religion and art. Counseling can be offered but effective interventions to assist in recovery have been difficult to identify due to the reports of efficacy and ineffective counseling. Comparisons are hard to make. Despite the lack of studies that describe effective interventions for those with grief after a miscarriage, some clinicians still offer counselling and follow-up to help women recover and adapt to the loss. Recommendations to help recover from the event include: * Turning to loved ones and friends for support. Sharing feelings and asking for help when needed. * Talking to the partner about the miscarriage. * Keeping in mind that men and women cope with loss in different ways. * Making good choices for health and well-being such as: eating healthy foods, keeping active, and getting enough sleep to help restore energy. * Joining a support group. A support group might help with feelings of being alone in the loss. * Doing something in remembrance of the baby. * Seeking help from a grief counselor, especially if the grief doesn't ease with time. Generally, the impact of experiencing miscarriage is underestimated. Other methods used to promote recovery are relaxation techniques, guided imagery, and \\"thought-stopping\\". Even Gestalt role-playing has been used. Some women can \\"emotionally relocate the child\\", redefine a relationship \\"with the missing child\\", and engage in \\"continuing the bond\\" to incorporate the loss into their life experiences. Women who have miscarried report that they were dissatisfied with the care they received from physicians and nurses. One observer highlights the insensitivity of some health care providers when they approach the grieving mother \\"...by playing down her emotion as somehow an irrational response...\\" Clinicians may not recognize the psychological impact of the miscarriage and can \\"expect parents to move on with their lives.\\" Since the experiences of women can vary so widely, sensitive nursing care afterward is appropriate. Children and concerns about future pregnancies One emotional response to miscarriage is the strong apprehension that can develop anticipating a subsequent pregnancy. Procreation abilities may also be questioned by the woman. Significant distress can develop in the other children in the family when they think a sibling has died. They may regard this as a baby they did not get to meet. They can also experience grief and guilt find it difficult to express these emotions to their parents. The siblings may feel a need to act as if everything is the same and that they are unaffected in an attempt to protect their parents from their own feelings. Children can also need help, understanding and the ability to make sense of the event. Memorials and burial Rituals that recognize the loss can be important in coping. Family and friends often conduct a memorial or burial service. Hospitals also can provide support and help memorialize the event. Depending on locale others desire to have a private ceremony. The religious faith of the woman and family impacts the grief process. Conversely, the lack of recognition that the miscarriage has occurred by family and friends can be troubling and add to the trauma of the event. In culture Grieving after the loss of a child through miscarriage in other cultures can vary from western culture. An individual's culture plays a large role in determining an inappropriate pattern of grief, and it is appropriate to take into account cultural norms before reaching a complicated grief diagnosis. There are cultural differences in emotional levels, how these are expressed and how long they are expressed. External symptoms of grief differ in non-Western cultures, presenting increased somatization.Horwitz, A. V., & Wakefield, J. C. (2007). The Loss of Sadness: How Psychiatry Transformed Normal Sorrow Into Depressive Disorder. Oxford University Press. Narratives by Swedish women include their own perception of losing a child. Investigations describe their grief over their miscarriage: \\"When miscarriage occurs it is not a gore, an embryo, or a fetus they lose, it is their child. They feel that they are the cause of the miscarriage through something they have done, eaten, or thought. They feel abandonment and they grieve for their profound loss; they are actually in bereavement.\\" Native American women have cut their long hair following the death of a family member. The narratives of women tend to coincide with quantified and measurable effects. In women who are induced to have an abortion, an identical grieving process can occur. The emotional responses to a spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) and an elective abortion are sometimes identical. Spanish women experience grief in much the same way in the rest of Western culture. Some women find online forums helpful.

History The execution of the Paris Foreign Missions Society missionary Auguste Chapdelaine was the official cause of the French involvement in the Second Opium War. France and Hong Kong bilateral relations could be traced back to the period of the Second French Empire (1852 to 1870). Hong Kong had been a British colony since the First Opium War. In 1856, a French missionary, Father Auguste Chapdelaine, was executed by Chinese local authorities in Guangxi province, which at that time was not open to foreigners. As a response, the French Empire joined with the British navy and prompted the Second Opium War. As a result of the victory of the joint navy, the Qing Empire ceded Kowloon Peninsular to the British Empire as an extension of the colony of Hong Kong.

Incidences 1884 Anti-France Strike and Riot Hong Kong dock workers in Whampoa Dock, Hung Hom started an anti-France strike on 11 September 1884 in order to protest French involvement in Indochina, South China Sea, and Taiwan. The workers involved were arrested by the Royal Hong Kong Police and fined by the court. That was followed by a riot starting on 3 October. Negotiation between the government and the protesters eventually resulted in the return of the fine to the workers. The long term strike and riot affected French fleet's reparation and supply. French faced several military setbacks in Indochina and Taiwan in late 1884 and early 1885, but ended up with a diplomatic success with the recognition of French protectorate over Annam and Tonkin in the Treaty of Tientsin concluded on 9 June 1885.Tsui Sing Yan, The History of Hong Kong in 12 Books, Hong Kong: Red, 2014, p.125.Thomazi, A., La conqu√™te de l'Indochine, Paris: 1934, pp.189-192. 2014 Umbrella Movement In Fall 2014, Hong Kong had seen a large scale protest, the Umbrella Movement, in striving for full democracy in Hong Kong.

Before 1989 he was a noted East German dissident.  Life   Provenance and early years  Stephan Krawczyk was born in Weida, a small industrial town in the hilly countryside between Erfurt and Karl-Marx Stadt (as Chmenitz was known at that time). His father, a miner, was employed in the uranium mines to the east and died while he was still a child. His mother worked for the postal service. Krawczyk passed his school final exams (\\"Abitur\\") in 1974 which would normally open the way to a university level education. Before that, however, between 1974 and 1976 he undertook his national/military service. He then worked variously as a concierge and as an administrative assistant at an arts institution.  Career in music  In 1976, like many ambitious people, Krawczyk became a member of the country's ruling Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED). The party would play a central part in his life during the next ten years. In 1978 he embarked on a distance-learning study course with the \\"Franz Liszt\\" music academy at Weimar, covering the concert guitar, after which he launched himself as a freelance singer-songwriter. Between 1978 and 1983 he built a significant reputation within East Germany as a member of the Gera-based folk group Liedehrlich. In 1981 the Minister for Culture and the Arts awarded him first prize in the National Chanson Contest (\\"Chansontage der DDR\\"). The Amiga record label issued a Liedehrlich album on which he starred, and which under the conditions operating in the German Democratic Republic was tantamount to recognition as a \\"national artist\\".  After Liedehrlich  Liedehrlich had been launched as a folk trio in 1978. At the end of 1982 it became a duo when Stephan Krawczyk withdrew from it. In or before 1984 he relocated to Berlin where he became part of the arts scene in the city's Prenzlauer Berg quarter. Many of those whom he met were involved in the underground but increasingly resolute and sometimes outspoken East German opposition movement. He took an increasing interest in abuses of power by government authorities, environmental degradation, individual rights and the lack of choices. In February 1984 he met the stage-director Freya Klier: during the next few months the two became life-partners. In April 1985 he resigned his party membership and the party reacted by expelling him. He was also served with a performance ban. From now on if he and his partner wished to perform music on a public stage they could do so only in a church. Far from being silenced, because of the reputation he had established with Liedehrlich, he became overnight one of the most high-profile opposition figures in East Germany. The authorities responded by identifying him as an \\"enemy of the nation\\" (\\"Staatsfeind\\") or even as \\"the new Wolf Biermann\\".  Life as a dissident  Over the next twelve months Krawczyk and Klier worked together on a programme of dramatic pieces and prose readings critical of the \\"socialist\\" society. These received supportive responses from audiences of church groups and in community halls. The authorities responded by pressuring the church authorities to block their appearances. But as matters turned out there were more and more churches and community groups that continued to provide them with venues for their presentations. Klier and Krawczyk (who married in 1986) also found themselves deluged with official fines, ordinances and injunctions. Krawczyk found himself subjected to a sustained programme of Stasi surveillance and harassment. Early in November 1987 Krawczyk and Klier jointly sent a letter - which quickly became an \\"open letter\\" - to the party's top ideologist, Kurt Hager. Copies of this letter were widely distributed through the usual informal channels across East Germany and it was also published in the West German media. It was read out at a church concert on 9 November 1987. The letter criticised social conditions in East Germany and called for extensive reforms. It demanded respect for human rights, the reversal of the performance ban that had been served on the two of them, and freedom from state control for the arts and culture sector. Freya Klier believes that the authorities made several attempts on their lives. Krawczyk was deprived of his driving permit for a trifling offence and their car, driven by Klier, was tampered with. On one occasion the brake connections were cut. On another occasion they presumably suffered a nerve gas attack by the car door as a result of which Klier, at the wheel, suffered delusions and narrowly avoided crashing into a tree.  Arrest  On 17 January 1988 Krawczyk was arrested while making his way to the officially backed Liebknecht-Luxemburg Demonstration, the mass parade was held each year in January to honour Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, two pioneers of German Communism who had been assassinated during months of revolution that followed the First World War. Klier and Krawczyk intended to join in so as to display banners of their own devising. The idea was to draw attention to their own work bans and to highlight more generally their criticisms of the East German social structure. However, at the last minute they learned that other dissident demonstrators had planned to use the event to highlight government refusal to permit them to emigrate to the west, an issue that had never gone away. It was anticipated that western television teams would attempt to report the demonstration, and in order to avoid the risk of \\"mixed messaging\\" Klier and Krawczyk decided to leave their own alternative banners at home. Weeks in advance, and well informed as ever, the Ministry for State Security had made their own plans to deal with dissident disruption of the 17 January 1988 celebration. In a series of house arrests immediately before the event approximately 120 civil rights activists were arrested and held for (and in some cases beyond) the duration of the event. (Other sources give the number arrested as 160.) Along with Krawczyk, those arrested directly ahead of the event included Vera Wollenberger and Herbert Mi√ülitz. Some dissidents nevertheless did participate in the demonstration, and despite the best endeavours of Ministry for State Security officials, several \\"unauthorized\\" banners appears on international television reports. The one that resonated most widely used a quote from Rosa Luxemburg herself: \\"Freedom is always the freedom to think differently\\" (\\"Die Freiheit ist immer die Freiheit des Andersdenkenden\\").  Detention and expulsion  The arrests during the hours before the demonstration were widely reported in East Germany and West Germany. That was not apparent to the detainees themselves, however. Krawczyk and the others were isolated in the Stasi's special Hohensch√∂nhausen jail. The only people from \\"outside\\" to whom they were given access were lawyers provided by the authorities. Not only did these lawyers fail to tell their clients what was going on \\"outside\\": they also assured their \\"clients\\" that no one \\"outside\\" was showing the slightest interest in their fate. At the same time, with the eyes of the media pointing towards them, the East German authorities were keen to avoid a high-profile Wolf Biermann-style deportation. The government objective became to ensure a \\"voluntary\\" expulsion to West Germany for Krawczyk and many other of the dissidents who had been arrested at the same time. At the same time, the party's national mass-circulation newspaper, Neues Deutschland published reports of his \\"secret service connections\\" and work began on a legal case against him involving \\"Association with enemies of the state\\" (\\"Landesverr√§terische Beziehungen\\"). The rest was left to Krawczyki's lawyer, a man called Wolfgang Schnur who enjoyed the full confidence of fellow dissidents in the local evangelical church community. (In March 1990 it would be discovered that Schnur had been working secretly for the Stasi since 1965, identified in their files variously as \\"IM-Torsten\\" or \\"Dr. Ralf Schirmer\\".) Through his lawyer Krawczyk was told to expect a twelve-year prison sentence. Alternatively, he could agree to deportation to the west. Although held in isolation, Krawczyk and Klier were able to communicate by passing messages through their lawyer, Wolfgang Schnur, whom they had both known for a long time and in whom they had complete trust. Having both agreed to deportation, on 2 February 1988 Stephen Krawczyk and Freya Klier were unceremoniously delivered across the border to West Berlin. Recovering from his experiences of persecution took a long time. After the changes, which led to surviving Stasi archives becoming accessible to the public, Krawczyk discovered that more than 80 former friends and associates had spied on him for the Stasi.  After the changes  Directly after reunification Krawczyk was less frequently in the public eye than his wife. The marriage ended in divorce in 1992. In 1994 Krawczyk was a prominent supporter of the successful independent candidate Stefan Heym in the Bundestag (national parliamentary) election. Since the 1990s he has published several books, strongly autobiographical, and dealing in particular with the life-experiences of the generation subjected to East Germany's take on socialism as they were growing up, such as \\"Das irdische Kind\\" (loosely: \\"The worldly/mortal child\\"). He also returned to his career as a musician, for instance issuing as \\"Stephan Krawczyk and Band\\" the CD album \\"Die Queen ist in der Stadt\\" (\\"The Queen's in town\\"). After the old Stasi jail at Berlin-Hohensch√∂nhausen was converted into a memorial-museum, in 2002 Krawczyk was one of the first to use it as a concert venue. During the 2007/2008 winter season he undertook a performance-tour in the east of Germany with his former wife, Freya Klier. Further stage appearance together followed.  Unintended faux pas  In 2009 Krawczyk was present at a ceremony at the Bellevue Palace at which twelve former East German civil rights activists received the Order of Merit from the president. The president at one stage turned to Krawczyk and asked him to provide an impromptu rendering of the national anthem. Krawczyk did so, beginning with the first verse. Although the anthem had been reinstated in West Germany in 1952, only the third verse is normally used. The first verse was considered gratuitously bombastic and within Germany carried painful associations in the aftermath of the Nazi years. In East Germany, till 1990, a completely different national anthem had been used. Klier was also present and intervened, causing Krawczyk to break off his rendering, and start again, this time with the third verse. He subsequently issued a public apology for the \\"unintended lapse\\" (\\"unbeabsichtigten Lapsus\\").

Born in Israel, Lang migrated to Australia as a young man and settled there in 1961. He is one of the pioneers of family therapy in Australia; one of the nation's best known family therapists. Lang has published and taught extensively in his professional area, both in Australia and worldwide.  Education and career  Lang studied psychology at the University of Melbourne. From 1965 to 1979, he was senior psychologist at the Bouverie Clinic, as well as director of training. During a sabbatical, in 1975, Lang worked in Ramat-Chen Mental Health Clinic in Israel. In 1979, Lang founded Williams Road Family Therapy Centre - the first independent centre of its kind in Australia. He was co-director of the Centre, with Dr Brian Stagoll, from 1981 to 1997. Lang remained involved with the Centre until 2012, when he became director of Williams Road Psychotherapy Centre. Lang was Foundation President of the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Family Therapy (ANZJFT) from 1979 to 1988 and President of the Victorian Association of Family Therapists (VAFT), now known as the Australian Association of Family Therapy (AAFT), from 1982 to 1984. In 1994, Moshe was Recipient of the Inaugural Award of Special Services to Family Therapy from ANZJFT and, in 1992, he was awarded Life Membership from AAFT. In 1980, Moshe gave the keynote address at the Inaugural Family Therapy Conference in Melbourne 1980. In addition to his clinical practice, Moshe is a prolific author and educator. His work includes a number of books, an educational DVD set, as well as radio and podcast interviews.  Key interest areas  Moshe has published extensively on themes ranging from therapy with children and adolescents, couples therapy, depression, eating disorders, holocaust survivors and their families, trans-generational trauma, school refusal, suicide and teaching family therapy.  Publications  Moshe has authored and co-authored numerous peer-reviewed journal articles, chapters in compilations, and books. His work has been translated and published in other languages. The Children's Depression Scale (CDS), co-authored with Miriam Tisher, has been used in many countries to research depression in children, and has been translated into Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Japanese, Hindu and Arabic. His other books are similarly highly regarded, having been extensively reviewed and on best seller lists, with some titles have been translated and published in other languages, such as Hebrew and French.  Storytelling and critical appraisal  Much of Moshe's published work demonstrates two core values. The first being the value of storytelling as a medium for learning. In his books Corrupting the Young and Resilience, co-authored with his wife Tesse Lang, Moshe uses a collection of short to medium stories to give readers a view into the clinician's room and insight into how family therapy works. Moshe offers \\"a journeyman style of learning... the reader being left to come to their own construction; where the author, therapist and teacher facilitates rather than instructs\\". With the story format, Moshe \\"calls upon the imagination as well as the intellect and leads to deeper insight\\". The other core value demonstrated in Moshe's work is the importance of exposing one‚Äôs practice for critical appraisal. He was one of the pioneers in Australia of video recording his work and writing in some depth about the subtleties of doing family therapy. Further, he invited other psychotherapy professionals to provide commentary on his clinical practice, such as in his book A Family in Therapy, co-authored with Peter McCallum, and its updated republication The Answer Within. Moshe continued this practice of invited commentary for a number of his major journal articles. With the release of his highly praised DVD-set Behind Closed Doors, Moshe further expanded the format of making his work transparent by demonstration, and thereby open to review.

Teaching family therapy  Lang spent his early career at the Bouverie Clinic under Dr Geoff Goding - broadly regarded as the person most instrumental in introducing family therapy to Australia. In 1979, when he founded Williams Road Family Therapy Centre, Lang envisioned \\"an independent family therapy institute away from the constraints of bureaucracies\\", according to Stagoll. The founding of the Centre was a positive development that made its own contribution to the flourishing of family therapy in Australia. It created a collegial atmosphere for learning through its summer schools, in addition to having an open system of working and an \\"open door policy\\" for its students. In addition to his work at Williams Road Family Therapy Centre, Lang has delivered numerous other presentation lectures and workshops on clinical psychotherapy and family therapy. According to Stagoll, Lang is a \\"master therapist, with an extraordinary ability to listen and find solutions without ever getting boxed into whatever the reigning ideology is. He taught me to always attend to the experience and requests of the patient and family. Our loyalty is not to the system, but to our clients.\\" Lang is well known for his unique teaching style which is marked by clarity, humour and empathy. Carolyn Quadrio states that \\"Moshe‚Äôs charm [comes] from his gentle worldliness\\".  Commentary on family therapy  As an expert commentator, Lang has spoken on family therapy and clinical psychology both in his professional sphere and to the wider public audience. He has been regularly interviewed in print, and on radio and podcast. In 2016, after being interviewed on We All Wear It Differently, a podcast for psychologist professionals, Lang was invited to be a regular commentator on the segment Mondays with Moshe. Lang speaks on a broad spectrum of topics - from ones of levity, such as 'Humour in Life and Therapy', to more solemn ones, such as his work with Holocaust survivors. According to Stagoll, it is Lang's \\"courage to enter terrible and violent realms of abuse, torture and terror\\", such as with Holocaust survivors, that demonstrate \\"the very best work in Family Therapy\\". He goes on to say that \\"together with [his] clients, [Lang has] been able to maintain a moral clarity and find a capacity to imagine words and stories that can help people move beyond deadly shames and amnesias. [Lang dares] to speak the unspeakable, and name that which has never been named. By doing this [he helps] reconnect people to both their old communities, and new ones, including communities dedicated explicitly to Human Rights. This work does not deny reality, but openly and honestly confronts it, to find ways to a better place, of justice and remembering.\\"  References   External links  * www.moshelang.com.au * www.williamsroadpsychotherapy.com.au 1939 births Living people Australian psychologists ","title":"Moshe Lang"},{"id":"55224133","text":"In 1963 a bye-election was held in for the Bilaspur Lok Sabha seat of the Lok Sabha of the Indian parliament from state of Madhya Pradesh.

In the 21st century, higher temperature and droughts driven by global warming have become more of a concern, and there has been increased advocacy for controlled burns and other measures to prevent fuel from accumulating in wild areas that can create more intense, larger, and difficult to control fires. Firefighters are generally employed by governments, including municipal and county fire departments, regional mutual aid organizations, and state agencies like the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. Wildfire response is coordinated at the federal level by the National Interagency Fire Center, with the participation of the U.S. National Weather Service, and various agencies of the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, Homeland Security, and Commerce. Fire squadrons of the United States Army are also sometimes called to large fires. History of wildfire policy Poster for forest fire prevention showing a burning cigarette and a forest fire. Since the turn of the 20th century, various federal and state agencies have been involved in wildland fire management in one form or another. In the early 20th century, for example, the federal government, through the U.S. Army and the U.S. Forest Service, solicited fire suppression as a primary goal of managing the nation's forests. At this time in history fire was viewed as a threat to timber, an economically important natural resource. As such, the decision was made to devote public funds to fire suppression and fire prevention efforts. For example, the Forest Fire Emergency Fund Act of 1908 permitted deficit spending in the case of emergency fire situations.Pyne, S.J. 1984. Introduction to wildland fire: Fire management in the United States. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, Inc. As a result, the U.S. Forest Service was able to acquire a deficit of over $1 million in 1910 due to emergency fire suppression efforts. Following the same tone of timber resource protection, the U.S. Forest Service adopted the \\"10 AM Policy\\" in 1935. Through this policy, the agency advocated the control of all fires by 10 o'clock of the morning following the discovery of a wildfire. Fire prevention was also heavily advocated through public education campaigns such as Smokey Bear. Through these and similar public education campaigns the general public was, in a sense, trained to perceive all wildfire as a threat to civilized society and natural resources. The negative sentiment towards wildland fire prevailed and helped to shape wildland fire management objectives throughout most of the 20th century. Texas was particularly hard-hit by wildfires in 2011, as noted by this placard at the state Forestry Museum in Lufkin. Beginning in the 1970s public perception of wildland fire management began to shift. Despite strong funding for fire suppression in the first half of the 20th century, massive wildfires continued to be prevalent across the landscape of North America. Ecologists were beginning to recognize the presence and ecological importance of natural, lightning-ignited wildfires across the United States. It was learned that suppression of fire in certain ecosystems may in fact increase the likelihood that a wildfire will occur and may increase the intensity of those wildfires. With the emergence of fire ecology as a science also came an effort to apply fire to ecosystems in a controlled manner; however, suppression is still the main tactic when a fire is set by a human or if it threatens life or property. By the 1980s, in light of this new understanding, funding efforts began to support prescribed burning in order to prevent wildfire events. In 2001, the United States implemented a National Fire Plan, increasing the budget for the reduction of hazardous fuels from $108 million in 2000 to $401 million. In addition to using prescribed fire to reduce the chance of catastrophic wildfires, mechanical methods have recently been adopted as well. Mechanical methods include the use of chippers and other machinery to remove hazardous fuels and thereby reduce the risk of wildfire events. Today the United States' maintains that, \\"fire, as a critical natural process, will be integrated into land and resource management plans and activities on a landscape scale, and across agency boundaries. Response to wildfire is based on ecological, social and legal consequences of fire. The circumstance under which a fire occurs, and the likely consequences and public safety and welfare, natural and cultural resources, and values to be protected dictate the appropriate management response to fire\\" (United States Department of Agriculture Guidance for Implementation of Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy, 13 February 2009). The five federal regulatory agencies managing forest fire response and planning for 676 million acres in the United States are the Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service, the United States Department of Agriculture-Forest Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Services. Several hundred million U.S. acres of wildfire management are also conducted by state, county, and local fire management organizations. In 2014, legislators proposed The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act to provide $2.7 billion fund appropriated by congress for the USDA and Department of Interior to use in fire suppression. The bill is a reaction to United States Forest Service and Department of Interior costs of Western Wildfire suppression appending that amounted to $3.5 billion in 2013. Wildland-urban interface policy An aspect of wildfire policy that is gaining attention is the wildland-urban interface (WUI). More and more people are living in \\"red zones,\\" or areas that are at high risk of wildfires. FEMA and the NFPA develop specific policies to guide homeowners and builders in how to build and maintain structures at the WUI and how protect against property losses. For example, NFPA-1141 is a standard for fire protection infrastructure for land development in wildland, rural and suburban areas and NFPA-1144 is a standard for reducing structure ignition hazards from wildland fire. For a full list of these policies and guidelines, see . Compensation for losses in the WUI are typically negotiated on an incident-by-incident basis. This is generating discussion about the burden of responsibility for funding and fighting a fire in the WUI, in that, if a resident chooses to live in a known red zone, should he or she retain a higher level of responsibility for funding home protection against wildfires. One initiative aimed at helping U.S. WUI communities live more safely with fire is called fire-adapted communities. Economics of fire management policy Today, in the United States, it is not uncommon for suppression operations for a single wildfire to cost millions of dollars. Federal funding to manage wildfires comes from the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior. The combined annual appropriations from these two departments were around $1.6 billion from FY1994‚ÄìFY2000. More recently, from FY2008‚ÄìFY2017, the combined annual appropriations were about $4.0 billion. (During this period, the high was $5.2 billion in FY2008 and the low was $2.9 billion in FY2012.) Subsequent years were $3.6 billion (FY2013), $4.1 billion (FY2014), $3.6 billion (FY2015), and $5.0 billion (FY2016). Although fire suppression purports to benefit society, other options for fire management exist. While these options cannot completely replace fire suppression as a fire management tool, other options can play an important role in overall fire management and can therefore affect the costs of fire suppression. Short-term fire suppression can, in the long term, result in larger, more intense wildfire events. In economic terms, expenditures used for wildfire suppression in the early 20th century have contributed to increased suppression costs which are being realized today. Climate change also results in larger, more intense wildfires. Regional burden of wildfires in the United States Map of United States National Interagency Fire Center agency Geographic Area Coordination Centers This map depicts regional burden to wildfires in the US from 1980‚Äì2014. These are categorized by \\"fire weather zone\\" as defined by the National Weather Service. Nationally, the burden of wildfires is disproportionally heavily distributed in the southern and western regions. The Geographic Area Coordinating Group (GACG) divides the United States and Alaska into 11 geographic areas for the purpose of emergency incident management. One particular area of focus is wildland fires. A national assessment of wildfire risk in the United States based on GACG identified regions (with the slight modification of combining Southern and Northern California, and the West and East Basin); indicate that California (50.22% risk) and the Southern Area (15.53% risk) are the geographic areas with the highest wildfire risk. The western areas of the nation are experiencing an expansion of human development into and beyond what is called the wildland-urban interface (WUI). When wildfires inevitably occur in these fire-prone areas, often communities are threatened due to their proximity to fire-prone forest.USDA Forest Service. 2011. Wildland fire and fuels fesearch and development strategic plan: Meeting the needs of the present, anticipating the needs of the Future. FS0854 The south is one of the fastest growing regions with 88 million acres classified as WUI. The south consistently has the highest number of wildfires per year. More than 50,000 communities are estimated to be at high to very high risk of wildfire damage. These statistics are greatly attributable to the South's year-round fire season.  Western U.S. wildfire trends  Save for areas on or near the northern and southern extents of the Pacific coast, North America tends to be wetter in the East and drier in the West. Over the last several decades, the Western United States has become a region of widespread, high- intensity wildfires. Since the 1970s, the Western U.S. has experienced three times the amount of \\"large fires\\" (fires that burn 1,000 acres or more) that are now burning on average more than 1.7 million acres of land per year‚Äî six times the average of 1970. The region has also experienced wildfire seasons that are 78 days longer than they were in 1970. It has been found that throughout the whole United States, 84% of these wildfires are started by humans. Smoke from the 2020 California wildfires settles over San Francisco A study conducted in 2019 found that from 1972 to 2018, California saw a fivefold increase in the area burned in any given year, and an eightfold increase in the area burned by summer fires. Another study estimated that the area burned between 1984 and 2015 could have been half of what it was without human-caused climate change. Finally, a 2020 research paper suggests that the number of autumn days with ‚Äúextreme fire weather‚Äù has doubled over the past two decades. The climate model analyses suggest that continued climate change will further amplify the number of days with extreme fire weather by the end of this century.Unprecedented': the US west's wildfire catastrophe explained In 2020, a series of particularly large wildfires were ignited all across California, Oregon, and Washington.

COLEX stands for column exchange. Since the beginning of the atomic era, a variety of lithium enrichments methods have been developed (such as chemical exchange, electromagnetic, laser, centrifugal) and the COLEX process has been the most extensively implemented method so far. Early development Y-12 Plant, in Oak Ridge TN. In the US, several chemical exchange methods for lithium isotope separation have been under investigation in the 1930s and 1940s to develop a process for lithium-6 production, so that tritium could be obtained for thermonuclear weapons research. The system finally selected was the COLEX process, with aqueous lithium hydroxide (LiOH) contacted with lithium-mercury amalgam. This process was initially used in the US between 1955 and 1963 in the Y12 plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The COLEX plants in Oak Ridge had a very rough start in 1955 with major problems in this entirely new, complicated, and potentially hazardous technology. Stockpiles of lithium-6 and lithium-7 from that period have been available until recently to meet the relatively small domestic and world demand Since then, due to environmental concerns, the US has stopped lithium enrichments operations in 1963. South Africa also built a pilot plant using the COLEX method to make lithium-6 for its nuclear weapons program in the 1970s. Lithium isotopes and uses Lithium floating in oil Natural lithium contains about 7.5 % lithium-6 ( ), with the rest being lithium-7 ( ). Natural lithium Naturally occurring lithium has many non nuclear industrial uses, ranging from Li-ion batteries, ceramics, lubricants, to glass. In the beginning of the 21st century, the steady increase of lithium world production is mainly stimulated by the demand of Li-ion batteries for electric vehicles. The nuclear applications of lithium requires relatively small annual quantities of lithium, in the form of enriched lithium-6 and lithium-7. Lithium-6 Lithium-6 is valuable as the source material for the production of tritium and as an absorber of neutrons in nuclear fusion reactions. Enriched lithium-6 is used as a neutron booster in thermonuclear bombs, and will be a key component in the tritium breeding modules (required enrichment from 7.5% to 30%-90%) of the future fusion reactors based on plasma confinement. The separation of lithium-6 has by now ceased in the large thermonuclear powers (notably USA, Russia, China), but stockpiles of it remain in these countries. Lithium-7 Highly enriched lithium-7 (more than 99%) is used as a coolant in molten salt reactors (MSRs) and pH stabilizer in pressurized water reactors (PWRs).Holden, Norman E. (January‚ÄìFebruary 2010). \\"The Impact of Depleted 6Li on the Standard Atomic Weight of Lithium\\". International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. Retrieved 6 May 2014.Managing Critical Isotopes: Stewardship of Lithium-7 Is Needed to Ensure a Stable Supply, GAO-13-716 // U.S. Government Accountability Office, 19 September 2013; pdf Working principle Lithium-6 has a greater affinity than lithium-7 for the element mercury. When an amalgam of lithium and mercury is added to aqueous lithium hydroxide, the lithium-6 becomes more concentrated in the amalgam and the lithium-7 more in the hydroxide solution. The COLEX separation method makes use of this by passing a counter-flow of lithium-mercury amalgam flowing down and aqueous lithium hydroxide flowing up through a cascade of stages. The fraction of lithium-6 is preferentially drained by the mercury, but the lithium-7 flows mostly with the hydroxide. At the bottom of the column, the lithium (enriched with lithium-6) is separated from the amalgam, and the mercury is recovered to be reused in the process. At the top, the lithium hydroxide solution is electrolyzed to liberate the lithium-7 fraction. The enrichment obtained with this method varies with the column length, the flow speed, and the operating temperature. Advantages and disadvantages From a technical and economical point of view, the COLEX separation has been so far the only method that enables industrial scale production of enriched lithium at minimal costs. The technology is mature, and has changed little since its development in the 1950s and 1960s. The method is not without a number of drawbacks, the main of which are: * toxicity and large amounts of mercury, participating in the process * amalgam trend to decomposition in aqueous solutions * formation of dangerous mercury-containing waste * high energy consumption The technology has potentially disastrous environmental implications. A significant amount of mercury is required (24 million pounds were used in the U.S. between 1955 and 1963) and there exists many opportunities for leaks into the environment. Cleanup remains extremely difficult and expensive. In spite of the health and environmental concerns associated with processes based on mercury, some research is still being done on the COLEX separation along with cleaner lithium enrichment methods. COLEX separation facilities in the world Nowadays, it seems that China is the only country in the world that officially employ the COLEX process to enrich lithium. Due to environmental concerns and relatively low demand for enriched lithium, further use of the COLEX process is officially banned in the USA since 1963, which strengthens China‚Äôs near unanimous hold over the market of enriched lithium, followed by Russia. Russian enrichment capacities focus on lithium-7 production by electrolysis of an aqueous lithium chloride solution using a mercury cathode, which is thus different from the COLEX process. Although US nuclear industry relies heavily on Chinese and Russian enriched lithium, the ecological concerns of the process may impede the future domestic use at industrial scale. However, with the upswing in research in the general area of fusion reactor technology (ITER, DEMO) there has been renewed interest during the last decade in better processes for 6Li-7Li separation, especially in Japan and the US. North Korea is assessed to have procured the wherewithal to build a lithium-6 enrichment plant based on the COLEX separation. No industrial-scale facilities exist today that could meet the future requirements of commercial fusion power plants.

He is a project professor at Kyoto University, technical director of Pathway Solutions Inc and president of NPO Bioinformatics Japan. He is one of Japan's most recognized and respected bioinformatics experts and is known for developing the KEGG bioinformatics database. In 2018 he was listed on a list of Clarivate Citation Laureates for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for \\"contributions to bioinformatics, specifically for his development of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)\\". Career Kanehisa studied at the University of Tokyo, gaining his Doctor of Science degree in physics in 1976. Following postdoctoral studies at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Los Alamos National Laboratory, he became a staff scientist at Los Alamos in 1981. While at Los Alamos, he was one of the developers of the GenBank database of all publicly available nucleotide sequences and their protein translations. Kanehisa joined Kyoto University as an associate professor in 1985, becoming a professor in 1987. In 1995, Kanehisa started the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database project. Foreseeing the need for a computerized resource that can be used for biological interpretation of genome sequence data, he started developing the KEGG PATHWAY database. It is a collection of manually drawn KEGG pathway maps representing experimental knowledge on metabolism and various other functions of the cell and the organism. Each pathway map contains a network of molecular interactions and reactions and is designed to link genes in the genome to gene products (mostly proteins) in the pathway. This has enabled the analysis called KEGG pathway mapping, whereby the gene content in the genome is compared with the KEGG PATHWAY database to examine which pathways and associated functions are likely to be encoded in the genome. Awards and honors In 1999, Kanehisa was elected the first president of the Japanese Society for Bioinformatics. He was elected as a Fellow of the International Society for Computational Biology in 2013.

Language A short word-list of Oitbi vocabulary was obtained by Paul Foelsche, and included in the compilation of Australian tribes composed by Edward Micklethwaite Curr in 1886-1887. Foelsche recorded this as the language of the people of Raffles Bay, but Tindale identified it as coming from a remnant of the Oitbi community. It is one of the Iwaidjan languages. The name \\"Oitbi\\" might have been a mishearing of warrkbi, the Iwaidja word for 'person'. Country Norman Tindale estimated that the Oitbi's traditional lands extended over some 300 sq.miles, from the southern coast of the Cobourg Peninsula to the Sir George Hope Islands. People The explorer George Windsor Earl who wrote one of the earliest records of the Oitbi, comparing them favourably with the Jaako, comes from the voyager George Windsor Earl remarked on what he perceived to be a Polynesian component in the makeup of the Oitbi:- > Arched eyebrows, straight silky hair, and complexions fairer than those of > the Australian aborigines generally, were by no means uncommon and many > individuals possessed, in a considerable degree, that obliquity in the > position of the eyes, which is considered as being characteristic of some of > the Polynesian tribes. These appearances were even more developed in the > people from the mountain ranges who occasionally visited us. Upon the whole, > I am very much inclined to suppose that there has been some infusion of the > Polynesian blood among the aborigines of this part of the continent. History The Oitbi probably experienced considerable interaction with the Makassans during their annual trading ventures around the waters of northern Australia. One indication of their presence among the Oitbi is one of their ethnonyms, Bidjenelumbo, which appears to be of Malayan origin. They suffered, like many of the aboriginal people of this area, a rapid phase of tribal disaggregation with the onset of European colonization, perhaps due also to the pressure of tribes on their south eastern flank driving them into the peninsula. In addition, if Tindale was correct in interpreting the language obtained by Paul Foelsche, the Inspector of Police at Port Darwin, from the 'Unalla' as being that of the Oitbi, then Foelsche states that by 1881, their numbers were down to 30: 7 men, 12 women, 9 boys and 2 girls. The drastic reduction from a once numerous tribe was attributed to the effects of smallpox introduced by Makassar trepangers in 1866, which decimated the tribe. Many of the tribes appear to have melted into the Iwaidja. In addition to the Oitbi there were five other tribes who managed to maintain memories of their independent tribal identities in the early period of European settlement: Wurango, Jaako, Iwaidja, Amarak, Djalakuru. The Gaari, a seventh tribe, became extinct. Alternative names * Heutbi (oitbi/auitbi is their word for 'no.') * Oitbo. * Bidjenelumbo, Bijnalumbo. Some words * looloot (tame dog) * lurkakie.
