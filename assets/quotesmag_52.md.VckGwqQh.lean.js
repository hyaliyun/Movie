He lost both his parents at an early age, and was educated at a military academy in Dublin. Robert Torrens, judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland), was his brother and Robert's namesake Colonel Robert Torrens, the economist, was his first cousin. The family was of Swedish origin, and came to Ireland about 1690 with William of Orange. Military career Torrens was commissioned as an ensign into the 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot in 1793 at the age of 14. In 1796 he served under Abercrombie in the West Indies, where he displayed great bravery, was wounded, and rewarded with a company. He served in Portugal in 1798; in Holland under the Duke of York in 1799; and afterwards in Nova Scotia, Egypt, and India. In 1799 Torrens went to Den Helder where he was involved in battles at Hoorne and at Egmond aan Zee: at the latter he was wounded by a bullet. In 1805 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. After seeing service at Buenos Aires in 1807, he accompanied Sir Arthur Wellesley as military secretary to Portugal in 1808, and was present at the battles of Roli√ßa and Vimiera.

Both needlepoint and Bobbin-laces were made in Ireland before the middle of the eighteenth century, but never, apparently, on a commercial scale. It was promoted by Irish aristocrats such as Lady Arabella Denny, the famous philanthropist, who used social and political connections to support the new industry and promote the sale of Irish lace abroad. Lady Denny, working in connection with the Dublin Society, introduced lace-making into the Dublin workhouses, especially among the children there. It is thought that it was an early form of Crochet, imitating the appearance of Venetian Gros Point lace.  History  The lace making skill soon spread beyond Dublin to the poorest parts of the country, and proved a popular means for young women to help support their families. Lace-making required little equipment beyond bobbins and fine cotton or linen thread, and a great deal of patience, so was suitable for remote parts of the country that had little industry and few employment options. The lace, worn by the wealthiest women across Europe was made by some of the poorest women in Ireland. Lace was a luxury commodity, used to decorate elaborate wedding dresses, christening robes, and church vestments, but it also played a vital part in saving many families from starvation and destitution. Irish lace reflects the social and political changes that took place between 1700 and the present. Several lace-making schools were established throughout Ireland, with some regions acquiring reputations for high-quality products. Different parts of the country produced distinctive types of lace, and discerning customers would soon learn to ask for Carrickmacross lace (County Monaghan) or Kenmare lace (County Kerry), Youghal lace (County Cork) among others, depending upon their favoured style. Limerick lace (also known as Tambour lace, because of its manner of manufacture) became well known from the 1830s onwards. When times were hard, women had to find ways of supporting their family. This was particularly true during and after the Great Famine of the 1840s. During that time period, most women could do needlework, so it was only a short step to lace-making. Irish Crochet and Tatting travelled particularly well as equipment needed was simple, a ball of cotton and a shuttle for Tatting and simple crochet hook and cotton for Irish Crochet lace. Kenmare lace Kenmare lace is a needlepoint Irish lace based on the detached buttonhole stitch. (It is sometimes called needle-lace to distinguish it from canvas needlepoint.) Linen thread was used by nuns to make needlepoint lace. Suitable linen thread is no longer available, so today cotton thread is used. Kenmare needlepoint laceKenmare Literary and Historical Society; (1982) Kenmare Journal begins with two pieces of cloth. Over this is layered a pattern and a matt contact. Thread is laid over the top in the outline of the design and secured with a fine detached buttonhole stitch in a process called \\"couching\\". The pattern is filled in by working in from the outline. The tension makes the pattern. How tightly the stitches are pulled determines whether the pattern's stitches are open or tight. When the work is finished, the thread holding down the outline is cut, thus releasing the lace from the cloth backing.  Carrickmacross lace  Carrickmacross lace was introduced into Ireland in about 1820 by Mrs Grey Porter of Donaghmoyne, who taught it to local women so that they could earn some extra money. The scheme was initially of limited success, and it was only after the 1846 famine, when a lace school was set up by the managers of the Bath and Shirley estates at Carrickmacross as a means of helping their starving tenants, that the lace became known and found sales.  Youghal lace  Youghal lace was a top quality commercial product that ended with the First World War. Lace Making was taught in Youghal from 1845 by the Presentation Sisters. Mother Mary Ann Smith reverse-engineered some Italian lace to understand how it was made. She then taught the technique to local women and thus the school of lace began.  Limerick lace  Limerick lace (also known as Tambour lace, because of its manner of manufacture) became well known from the 1830s onwards. following the establishment of a lace- making factory in the city by an English businessman, Charles Walker, a native of Oxfordshire. In 1829, he brought over 24 girls to teach lacemaking in Limerick, drawn to the area by the availability of cheap, skilled female labour, and his business thrived: within a few short years his lace factories employed almost 2,000 women and girls. Irish Crochet lace Irish crochet lace was developed in mid-nineteenth century Ireland as a method of imitating expensive Venetian point laces. It was initially taught in convents throughout the country and used as part of Famine Relief Schemes. Charity groups sought to revive the economy by teaching crochet lace technique at no charge to anyone willing to learn. This type of lace is characterized by separately crocheted motifs, which were later assembled into a mesh background.

He was managing editor and editor in chief for Harvey Comics. Jacobson is also known for his late-career collaborations with artist Ernie Col√≥n, including such nonfiction graphic novels as The 9/11 Report: A Graphic Adaptation and Anne Frank: The Anne Frank House Authorized Graphic Biography.  Biography  Sid Jacobson graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School and then New York University, where he majored in journalism. His first jobs out of school were at the New York tabloid The Compass and the horse racing paper The Morning Telegraph. In the 1950s and 1960s, while working at Harvey Comics, Jacobson wrote songs for such pop acts as Frankie Avalon (\\"A Boy Without a Girl\\"), Earl Grant (\\"(At) The End (of a Rainbow)\\"), Dion and the Belmonts, and Johnny Mathis‚Äîdespite the fact that Jacobson did not read music. It was at Harvey that Jacobson met artist Ernie Col√≥n, whose work he edited for many years both there and at Star Comics. After his long stint at Harvey, Jacobson became an executive editor at Marvel Comics, where he helped create the children's imprint Star Comics. In addition to editing the entire Star line, Jacobson contributed scripts to some of the titles such as Wally the Wizard and Top Dog. He wrote comics adaptations of the films Santa Claus: The Movie (1985), Labyrinth (1986), Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night (1987), and Elvira, Mistress of the Dark (1988). During this period, Jacobson published the novel Streets of Gold (Pocket Books, 1985), a fictionalized history of his family's immigration journey from the shtetls of Russia to the United States. Jacobson returned to Harvey Comics in the early 1990s, among other things creating a line of Hanna-Barbera comics, original stories based on the animated TV series characters. In 2006, Jacobson and his old Harvey colleague Ernie Col√≥n teamed up as writer and illustrator to create a graphic novel version of the 9/11 Commission Report titled The 9/11 Report: A Graphic Adaptation.

In the most popular version of the event, but never verified, Mann is said to have performed a striptease for members of the Nazi regime and once down to naught but high heels, took one of her shoes and stabbed Walter Quakernack in the face with the heel-piece, causing him to drop his firearm, which she then used to shoot Schillinger and Emmerich. Schillinger ultimately died from his wounds several hours later while Emmerich was left with a permanent limp. According to another account, however, she was a Nazi collaborator who was executed by the Polish underground in the Fall of 1942. Life Franciszka Mann was a young dancer residing in Warsaw before the Second World War. She studied dance in the dance school of Irena Prusicka. Her friends at that time included Wiera Gran and Stefania Grodzie≈Ñska. In 1939 she was placed 4th during the international dance competition in Brussels among 125 other young ballet dancers.Terpsychora i lekkie muzy, Bo≈ºena Mamontowicz-≈Åojek, Polskie Wydawn.

At the beginning of the Second World War she was a performer at the Melody Palace nightclub in Warsaw. She was a prisoner in the Warsaw Ghetto. In several publications she is mentioned as a German collaborator.Edward Reichter, W ostrym ≈õwietle dnia.

Marian Fuks, Wydawnictwa Radia i Telewizji, 1989 Her name is associated with the \\"Hotel Polski affair\\". She is mentioned in Filip Mueller's eyewitness account Eyewitness Auschwitz as well as in the account of Jerzey Tabau, a former Birkenau prisoner. Tabau's report was filed for the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg as Document L-022. On October 23, 1943, a transport of around 1,700 Polish Jews arrived on passenger trains at the death camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau, although they had been told that they were being taken to a transfer camp called Bergau near Dresden, from where they would continue on to Switzerland to be exchanged for German POWs. One of the passengers was Franceska Mann. She had probably obtained her foreign passport from the Hotel Polski on the Aryan side. In July 1943, the Germans arrested the 600 Jewish inhabitants of the hotel and some of them were sent to Bergen-Belsen as exchange Jews. Others were sent to Vittel in France to await transfer to South America. According to some versions, the new arrivals were not registered but were told that they had to be disinfected before crossing the border into Switzerland. They were taken into the undressing room next to the gas chamber and ordered to undress. Other versions of the story mention the events that follow taking place at either the selection ramp or a labor area of the camp. Regardless of location, what is confirmed is that she fatally wounded the roll call officer Josef Schillinger, using a pistol (many accounts say his own) and fired two shots, wounding him in the stomach. Then she fired a third shot which wounded another SS Sergeant named Emmerich. According to Tabau, the shots served as a signal for the other women to attack the SS men; one SS man had his nose torn off, and another was scalped. However, accounts vary: in some Schillinger and Emmerich are the only casualties. Reinforcements were summoned and the camp commander, Rudolf H√∂ss, came with other SS men carrying machine guns and grenades. According to Filip Mueller, all people not yet inside the gas chamber were mowed down by machine guns. Other mentioned outcomes are the Jewish women being herded into the gas chamber, taken outside and executed, or Franceska taking her own life with the stolen pistol. Due to various conflicting accounts, it is unclear what truly happened next; the only things that are certain are on that day Schillinger died, Emmerich was wounded, and all the Jewish women were killed. According to Jan Grabowski, however, Franciszka Mann was an infamous collaborator and szmalcownik, who turned in a Polish resistance member to the Germans and was shortly thereafter, in the fall of 1942, executed by the Polish underground.

History The settlement emerged in 13th century and belonged to Waldsassen Abbey, which colonized the area. The German name of Markhausen derives from its position at a border (or, demarcation; German Mark (border); Hausen from German Haus(house), i.e. from the fact that there are houses at a border). The first mention in official documents can be dated back to 1348. Successively, for roughly 250 years, the place does hardly appear historical documents. In 1608, Markhausen was founded again and is mentioned in a 1715 map of the Elbogener Kreis by the minister cartographer Adam Friedrich Z√ºrner. Back then, the settlement belonged to neighboring Kr√°sn√° u Kraslic (German: Sch√∂nwerth). The inhabitants' economy based mainly upon forgecraft, the production of wood charcoal and mining. In 1610, Markhausen became a Katastralgemeinde. In 1847, 302 people lived there in 32 houses, then living mainly from agriculture and lace production.

There was a 4-form school, the Hraniƒçn√° auxiliary fire brigade a post office, a customs office, a Gendarmerie station, a cinema, a public open air bath a factory, many craftsmen and traders. Municipal life included six registered clubs and two musical bands, frequenting the eight pubs of the village. The terrific situation at the Saxon border secured vivid commercial transit and tourism. Guests especially headed for the pubs, which hosted concerts and dances frequently. The more famous localities were the \\"Brauner Hund\\" (German for Brown Dog), the \\"Schwarze Katz\\" (German for Black Cat) and the \\"Reichsgrenze\\" (German for Empire's Border) In 1946, the German inhabitants were forcibly deported and Markhausen repopulated from within central Czechoslovakia. In 1947, \\"Hraniƒçn√°\\" was given as its new name. In 1948, 220 inhabitants were counted. In 1955, the demolition of the village was started, to establish an uninhabited border strip. Until 1967 trespassing was strictly prohibited. Following the Velvet Revolution, the advantageous position was reclaimed by two gas stations, three restaurants and a market area, including a number of shops for Asian raw foods, cigarettes and other commodities. The road between Klingenthal and Kraslice is free to use by automobiles up to 3,5 tons or up to 9 passengers and well-frequented. Also, a well-developed cycle track allows convenient tours.

Early life Little is known of Chappe's early life. He was born into a noble family in the Auvergne region of central France. He entered the priesthood, probably as a Jesuit, and devoted himself to the study of astronomy. He was appointed assistant astronomer at the Royal Observatory and admitted to the Royal Academy of Sciences on 14 January 1759.. Distance from the Earth to the Sun In the mid-18th century, the dynamics of the Solar System were reasonably well understood, but astronomers only had an approximate idea of its scale. If the distance between two planets could be measured, all the other distances would be known from Kepler's laws of planetary motion. The best candidate for an accurate measurement was the distance between the Earth and Venus, which could be calculated from observations of transits of Venus, when Venus passes directly between the Earth and the Sun, appearing as a small black dot moving across the face of the Sun. However, transits of Venus are very rare. Before 1761, the previous transit had been in 1639; after 1769, the next transit would be in 1874. The importance of the measurement led to an unprecedented international effort to obtain as many observations as possible from different points in the world ‚Äì points as far apart from one another as possible. Despite the Seven Years' War which was raging throughout most of the world, astronomers were given letters of introduction and safe passage to enable them to reach their observation points and make their observations under the coordination of the various learned societies. Transit of Venus 1761 One of the illustrations from Chappe's Voyage en Sib√©rie, an engraving of a Russian peasant woman by Jean- Baptiste Le Prince. Chappe was chosen to go to Tobolsk in Siberia to observe the transit of Venus expected for 6 June 1761. The trip was arduous and Chappe arrived in Tobolsk with little time to spare, although he was able to observe the lunar eclipse of 18 May, which enabled him to calculate the longitude of Tobolsk. The spring floods of the Tobol and Irtysh rivers had been particularly severe that year, and some of the local peasants blamed the foreigner with his strange equipment who was \\"messing with the Sun\\": Chappe had to be protected by a cordon of armed Cossacks to make his observations. Fortunately, the weather conditions were excellent, and Chappe was able to observe the entire transit. He published his results from Saint Petersburg (M√©moire du passage de V√©nus sur le soleil, avec des observations sur l'astronomie et la d√©clinaison de la boussole faites √† Tobolsk, en Sib√©rie), and didn't return to France until 1763.. Chappe published an account of his travels through Russia (Voyage en Sib√©rie fait en 1761 (avec la description du Kamtschatka, trad. du russe de Khracheninnikow)) in 1768. The text is hardly a flattering description of the country, and an anonymous pamphlet (Antidote ou R√©futation du mauvais livre superbement imprim√© intitul√© : Voyage en Sib√©rie, etc.) was soon circulating whose authorship is often attributed to Catherine the Great herself (although Count Andrey Petrovich Shuvalov is more likely the polemicist). Longitude measurement The problem of longitude measurement had been at the heart of astronomical research for a century or more, and marine chronometers were steadily becoming more accurate. Chappe and physicist Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau (1700‚Äì82) were selected to test one such chronometer, made by Swiss watchmaker Ferdinand Berthoud (1727‚Äì1807) on board the corvette L'Hirondelle in 1764. Transit of Venus 1769 For the transit of Venus on 3 June 1769, Chappe's destination was the Mission of San Jos√© del Cabo at the tip of the Baja California peninsula in modern-day Mexico. The journey and observation were uneventful. However, as the expedition was packing to return, an outbreak of fever (possibly yellow fever) hit the area. Chappe stayed to tend the sick, but was infected and died on 1 August. Only one member of the expedition made it back to Paris alive with Chappe's observations and notes. Chappe's account of his journey (Voyage en Californie, pour l'observation du passage de V√©nus sur le disque du soleil) was published posthumously by his colleague C√©sar Cassini de Thury. Legacy As well as the contributions his observations of the transits of Venus gave to solving the problem of the size of the solar system, his nephew, Claude Chappe was greatly inspired by reading \\"Voyage en Sib√©rie\\". Claude went on, with his brothers, to create the first optical telegraph network using semaphores and telescopes.The Early History of Data Networks Asteroid 14961 d'Auteroche, discovered by Eric Walter Elst at La Silla in 1996, was named in his honor.

It is found only in the southeastern region of the United States: southwest, central and east central Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee. As a relict species, there are a few remaining groups but it was once more abundant when conditions were different. Significant habitat loss has occurred through clearing of forests for agricultural and pine farm uses. On April 4, 1988, it was officially listed as an endangered species. The common name varies by location. It grows in undisturbed hardwood forests that sometimes include mature pines and that are free of understory plants such as bushes and vines. It likes moist, well- drained soils along the banks of streams and small stream floodplains, mixed with other wildflowers and forest debris. Trillium reliquum was first collected near Augusta in 1901 but was not described as a new species until 1975. In February 2010, hikers found the plant at the Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park in the Florida Panhandle. The US Fish and Wildlife Service is surveying the plants. Flower Trillium reliquum has a sessile flower on a curved stem at the center of its three mottled leaves that are blue-green, to green to silver in color. It flowers from March to April. From the end of a stocky underground rhizome, the plant sprouts a single shoot topped by the three mottled leaves and a single sessile flower; the flower is only half the size of the leaves. The stem is normally not erect, but rather lies along the ground. The flower consists of three petals, alternating with three sepals. The flowers can be greenish to brownish-purple and even pure yellow at times. Its three sepals spread out and usually are a purple color on the inside. The three petals tend to be erect and somewhat twisted, varying from dark purple to yellow in color. The petals are about twice as long as the stamens. The fruit, which is a round, fleshy capsule, appears from May to June. Future The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service lists this plant as surviving in 21 sites in Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina. The trillium reliquum has also been found in Tennessee and Florida. The reasons for the restrictions of this formerly widespread plant to only a few locations is not entirely clear. It is not commonly collected in the wild (for aesthetic or other uses) and is therefore considered relatively safe, in spite of its endangerment. There is no evidence that its numbers have declined recently. References External links  * Recovery plan for trillium reliquum U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.

She was an advocate for syndicalist causes and a proponent of women in the labor movement. A co- founder of Concordia University's Simone de Beauvoir Institute, dedicated to feminist studies, Monet-Chartrand also co-founded the Federation des femmes du Quebec, the pacifist movement Voix des Femmes, and the Movement for Nuclear Disarmament.  Early life  Simonne Monet-Chartrand was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in 1919. Her parents were Aurore-Berthe Alain and Am√©d√©e Monet, who was a judge, as was her grandfather Dominique Monet. Her family was well-off, spending summers on the Richelieu River in Beloeil. She studied at a Catholic boarding school in Montreal, and began noting the inequalities between boys and girls at a young age. A dark stain on her otherwise idyllic childhood was the death of her brother Roger, of tuberculosis; Monet-Chartrand also caught the disease, but she survived thanks to a long stay in a sanatorium in the Laurentides. After graduating high school, she attended the Universit√© de Montr√©al from 1939 to 1942, where she studied literature. Her activist career began with joining the Jeunesse √âtudiante Chr√©tienne, a youth organization of the Catholic social movement, during her student years. She led the organization's provincial-level board of directors and began to work with a number of influential activist figures, including fellow Catholic youth leader Michel Chartrand. Her upper-class family opposed her relationship with the working-class Chartrand‚Äîthey temporarily sent her to Chicago in the United States in an effort to split the couple up, and three priests refused to marry them before they could find one who would agree to do so. Nevertheless, the two wed in 1942. They would go on to have seven children together and to support each other in their political activism.  Career  Monet-Chartrand took up the cause of feminism beginning in the 1930s, fighting for women's right to vote in Quebec, which was the last province to institute women's suffrage. Her political involvement grew during the Conscription Crisis of 1944, and she joined the Bloc populaire, an anti-conscription political party. In the 1950s, Monet-Chartrand joined the labor movement, helping the wives of strikers and arguing that women should be able to participate in union contract negotiations. She was a member of the socio-political committee for the Quebec Teachers Union, and in the '70s she worked for the teachers' union in Champlain, Quebec. In the '60s, Monet-Chartrand co-founded the pacifist group Voix des Femmes and the F√©d√©ration des femmes du Qu√©bec, a feminist organization. Her anti-war activism had begun with opposition to World War II and an anti-nuclear instinct in response to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which she stuck with through the Korean War, the Cold War, the Vietnam War, and the Gulf War. She was also a co-founder of the Movement for Nuclear Disarmament. Monet-Chartrand's activism, particularly her feminist organizing, extended internationally. She attended women's conferences in Europe and represented the Human Rights League of Quebec at conferences in the Middle East. She organized the Peace Train's arrival in Ottawa in 1962 to present the demands of feminist pacifists. She also held a conference to express these demands during Expo 67. In 1978 and 1979, Monet-Chartrand returned to her studies at Concordia University, where she also co-founded the Simone de Beauvoir Institute, a college dedicated to feminist studies. In 1979, she was a candidate for the Rhinoceros Party, a satirical political party, to represent the district of Longueuil in Parliament. She received 5 percent of the vote. Monet-Chartrand also worked as a journalist, contributing to various publications as a writer, including Ch√¢telaine, La Vie en rose, and Les t√™tes de pioche. She was also a longtime writer, researcher, and presenter for Radio Canada, particularly for religious broadcasts and women‚Äôs broadcasts. Her work as a writer also included her four-volume autobiography, Ma vie comme rivi√®re, which was originally published in 1981 and re-issued with updates in 1992. Her second book, focusing on her pacifist activism, was published in 1988 with the title L'espoir et le d√©fi de la paix. She also wrote a two-volume history of Quebec's women, published in 1990 and 1994. In 1992, she received the Prix Idola Saint-Jean for her feminist work. In her own words, Monet Chartrand fought to \\"build a socialist society.\\" She also remained a deeply religious person, true to her roots on the Catholic left. As she once said, in response to being called a \\"fanatic\\": > \\"Christ was a fanatic, and anybody who ever accomplished anything for their > country was a fanatic.\\"  Death and legacy  Laval University. Simonne Monet-Chartrand died of cancer on January 18, 1993, in Richelieu. In 1996, her son Alain Chartrand and the filmmaker Diane Cailhier released a film about her life, titled Ma vie comme rivi√®re. They also produced a television mini-series about Monet- Chartrand and her husband called Chartrand et Simonne in 2000. Several buildings and institutions have been named for her, including a center for victims of domestic violence and an elementary school in Montreal.

The building served as the local high school and kindergarten. The building was designed by Madison architect Edward Tough in late Gothic revival style, evident in its tall, narrow windows and masonry. The walls of the original section were load- bearing clay tile clad in red brick, sitting on a poured concrete foundation. With It had hardwood floors in all classrooms and terrazzo floors in the stairs and hallways, accented with marble tile borders. The school was state- of-the-art for its time, with a regulation size (for 1922) basketball court, cafeteria, and stage on the lowest level. The upper level had skylights in the rooms. The building served as a high school until 1962. As the baby boom progressed, the building became too overcrowded, housing up to 300 students. A new high school was constructed on the village's east side. At this time, the building was saved from the wrecking ball, underwent some minor renovations, and was later used as part of the elementary school. In 1993, a new middle school opened and classes that were in Red Brick were relocated to parts of the previous middle school that had recently been vacated. The building slipped into a state of disrepair beginning in 1993. It was being used only for storage, and important problems, such as roof leaks, went unnoticed.

The whole terrace is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. The terrace is called Prince's Gate because it stands opposite the Prince of Wales' Gate to Hyde Park, named after the Prince of Wales who later became Edward VII. In its earlier days its occupants included members of the Morgan family of American bankers. From the 1920s to the 1950s it was the residence of eight American ambassadors. It later became the first headquarters of the Independent Television Authority and was until 2010 the headquarters of the Royal College of General Practitioners. History Early history The terrace containing 13 and 14 Prince's Gate was completed in 1849. It was designed by Harvey Lonsdale Elmes and built by John Kelk. Shortly after completion of the terrace, the Crystal Palace was built opposite in Hyde Park to house the Great Exhibition of 1851. The first owner of No. 13 was George Baker, a building contractor. No. 14 was leased and then owned by John Pearce, but he did not live there. The first resident, from 1852, was Edward Wyndham Harrington Schenley, a former soldier, who later bought the freehold. In 1854 No. 13 was rented by the American banker Junius Spencer Morgan, who bought the house at some time between 1857 and 1859. On his death in 1890 his son, John Pierpont Morgan, inherited the house. Pierpont Morgan spent up to three months every year in London, either in Prince's Gate or at Dover House, in Putney. He was a collector of great art, paintings, books, and many other objects, most of which were kept at Prince's Gate. By 1900 the collection was too big to be contained in the house and part of it was loaned to the Victoria and Albert Museum. His collection of paintings included works by Reynolds, Gainsborough, Romney, Constable, Van Dyke, Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Fragonard, Vel√°zquez and Holbein. For the nine months of the year that Pierpont Morgan was away from London, the house was cared for by his housekeeper. In 1904, he bought the house next door, No. 14, from Schenley's widow, Mary, and amalgamated it with No. 13\\\\. The conjoined house was numbered 14\\\\. Its external appearance remained that of two separate houses, but internally structural alterations were made. These included the replacement of No. 14's principal staircase by an octagonal hall, and the creation of a lobby with marble columns on the floor above. Pierpont Morgan died in 1913 and the house was inherited by his son, John Pierpont Morgan Junior. The latter never lived in the house and in the First World War he loaned it to the Council of War Relief for the Professional Classes, who used it as a maternity home. Home of American ambassadors After the war the house was offered to the American Government as a home for their ambassadors and this offer was accepted in 1921. The house was first used for this purpose in 1929, and this use continued with one interval until 1955. Official business was not conducted at the house, but at the Embassy chancery in Grosvenor Square. The American architect Thomas Hastings was employed to refurbish the building and remodel the fa√ßade. As part of this he added images of the heads of Native Americans in the keystones of the arches over the ground floor windows. Hastings transformed the fa√ßade in Beaux-Arts style and added a grand staircase. He also modified rooms on the lower two floors to make them more suitable for entertaining. Eight ambassadors lived in the house. The first of these was Charles Gates Dawes, who lived there from 1929 to 1932. The Dawes Plan was named after him and he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Before he moved to London he was Vice President of the United States. He was succeeded for a short time in 1932 by the banker Andrew Mellon. Like John Pierpont Morgan, Mellon was a major art collector and for a time his collection was housed at Prince's Gate. Mellon was followed by Robert Worth Bingham who served until 1937; he was the ambassador who had the longest residence in the house. Next came Joseph P. Kennedy, father of the future President of the United States, John F. Kennedy. During the Second World War, the ambassador was John Winant, although he did not live in the house, which remained vacant throughout the war. Winant resigned in 1946 and the following year was succeeded by Lewis Douglas, who lived in the house until 1950. The next ambassador was Walter Gifford who served until 1953 when he was succeeded by Winthrop Aldrich. By 1955 a large block of flats had been built next to the house that overlooked and dominated its terrace and the garden behind it. This was considered to be a security risk so the house was sold and the American ambassadors moved to Winfield House. More recent history The house was bought by the Independent Television Authority in July 1955 who used it as their headquarters for six years. They moved out in 1961 when it had become too small for their needs and the house was empty for a year. In July 1962 the Royal College of General Practitioners bought the freehold of the house for ¬£175,000 (¬£ as of ) to develop it into their headquarters. In 1976 the business of the college was extended next door into No. 15 Prince's Gate. In 1992 the college obtained the freehold of No. 15. The college sold the building in 2010 and moved its headquarters to Euston Square. The work of the college was disrupted on the morning of 30 April 1980 with the onset of the Iranian Embassy Siege. The embassy was next to the college at 16 Prince's Gate. The college was evacuated, except for two administrators who were retired naval officers. The siege lasted for five days. Rooms in the college were used by the Special Air Service to plan its attack which ended the siege. Architecture Like the buildings at the other end, no.14 is slightly set forward from the rest of the terrace. All the houses in the terrace have five storeys and a basement, and all are stuccoed. As first built, Nos. 13 and 14 were similar houses. Like the rest of the terrace, each had a projecting porch with Ionic columns. To the left of these were two windows. The first floor had a balustraded balcony and three windows over which was a cornice with a central pediment. This was changed by Hastings' remodelling of the fa√ßade. The house as a whole now has four bays with rusticated quoins on both corners. On the ground floor, from the east there are two round-headed windows, then the entrance door with a round arch, and then another round-headed window. The keystone of each of these arches bears the image of a Native American. All the other windows in the building are square-headed. The porches and first-floor balconies were removed in Hastings' remodelling. The first floor has four windows; over each of these is a pediment containing decorative plasterwork. The second floor has four windows, while the third floor has six windows. The top floor also has six windows, with decorative plasterwork between them, and over these is a cornice. As such, it included offices, a library, a museum, rooms for meetings and conferences, and residential accommodation for officers and members of the College. Behind the building is an enclosed garden, formed by the terrace in Prince's Gate and other terraces, in a similar fashion to other London squares. In 2010 the College sold the building to a private overseas family fund \\"for an undisclosed fee\\".

The road's construction through untouched wilderness was the cause of protests and blockades in the early 1980s. The road was completed in 1984, connecting Cape Tribulation to Cooktown. This route is an alternative to the Mulligan Highway further inland. It passes over the Donovan and Cowie Ranges. To reduce the environment impact the road was designed with few switchbacks and bends on the climbs resulting in patches of steep gradients over the ranges. The track itself is 30 km in length. The road is only partially sealed and may be impassable after heavy rains. Access to Bloomfield Falls and the aboriginal community of Wujal Wujal is provided by the road which also crosses the Bloomfield River. Tourism along the Bloomfield Track has been popular. Visitors are drawn to the pristine rainforest, swimming holes, creeks and beaches. Access The track begins at Cape Tribulation and winds its way north through the Daintree Rainforest, crossing many creeks in the process; then it ends at the aboriginal community Wujal Wujal. Many local authorities recommend that the journey should be undertaken in a four-wheel-drive vehicle, however recent upgrades have been undertaken (including the construction of bridges at the Bloomfield River and Woobooda Creek crossings in 2014/15, as well as paving works on the Cowie and Donovan Ranges) that make the road more suitable for some two-wheel-drive vehicles, provided that they are driven with care in dry weather only. Protests Douglas Shire Council and the Government of Queensland supported the road's development. Environmentalists opposed the road on the basis that it would bring unwanted development to an area of high environmental significance. Blockades against bulldozers brought police and arrests were made. This resulted in national and international attention to the issue. The campaign to protect the Daintree Rainforest through which the road passed eventually resulted in the area being declared a World Heritage Site. The Queensland Government opposed the World Heritage listing. It took the issue to the High Court of Australia to stop it but was unsuccessful.

In 2016 the population was 24,387. History Eppendorf in 1845, similar view as above Eppendorf, first mentioned as Eppenthorp in 1140, is Hamburg's oldest village. Its name originates either from the old Germanic epen (on the water) or from the personal name Ebbo/Eppo. It is possible, but unlikely, that it was named after Ebbo, the archbishop of Reims. During the restoration of the St. Johannis Church, which was first mentioned in 1267, ruins of an older stone tower were found. In the 19th century, Eppendorf gained popularity among the affluent people in Hamburg. The low-lying, moist land was banked up and built on. The last area of moorland, the Eppendorfer Moor, was placed under nature protection in 1982. In 1894, Eppendorf was transferred to Hamburg.

Amtrak took over the service from Penn Central in 1975 and discontinued it in 1984. History 1972 Penn Central timetable showing the Valpo Local and Detroit-Ann Arbor commuter service As Amtrak's mandate did not cover commuter operations, Penn Central continued to operate a weekday commuter service between Detroit and Ann Arbor, Michigan after Amtrak had assumed control of its intercity operations. By the mid-1970s Penn Central asked to discontinue the service, citing dwindling ridership and the aging Rail Diesel Cars it used. Amtrak and the U.S. state of Michigan agreed to step in, and the Michigan Executive made its first run on January 20, 1975, running between Detroit and Jackson (to the west of Ann Arbor). In the summer of 1975, the westbound Friday Michigan Executive operated all the way to Chicago, returning the following Sunday. Under Amtrak, ridership increased 50% and peaked at 96,573 in 1979. Chartered buses carried passengers from the Detroit station to downtown Detroit. Declining ridership due to the decline of downtown Detroit, a recession, and ticket price hikes led Amtrak to discontinue the westbound Michigan Executive on June 14, 1982 and eastbound service between Jackson and Detroit was truncated only running from Ann Arbor to Detroit. Returning commuters took the Chicago-Detroit Twilight Limited which was modified adding stops to accommodate former westbound Executive passengers. By 1983, annual ridership had fallen to 26,000. Amtrak completely discontinued the remainder of the Michigan Executive on January 13, 1984, after Michigan withdrew its support citing low ridership. State transportation officials estimated that the discontinuance would save $200,000/year, and daily ridership had dwindled below 60.

The first permanent European settlement in the area was Fort Orange, a trading post built by the Dutch West India Company in 1624, about south of the mouth of the creek.Warren (2009), p. 32 However, the mouth of the Poesten Kill at the Hudson is said to be first genuine European frontier settlement outside the barricades of Fort Orange.Warren (2009), p. 15 The land making up much of current-day Albany and Rensselaer counties was sold by the Mohicans in 1630 to Kiliaen van Rensselaer, a Dutch merchant and businessman.Van Laer (1908), p. 54 With the land, Van Rensselaer began the only successful patroonship ‚Äì essentially a feudal manor ‚Äì in the history of the Dutch colonies: Rensselaerswyck.Van Laer (1908), p. 55 Van Rensselaer named the land surrounding the mouth of the Poesten Kill Pafraets Dael after his mother, Maria Pafraet.Van Laer (1908), p. 43 This can be seen on the first map of Rensselaerswyck, though the Poesten Kill is not identified. The Dutch can be credited for the source of the creek's name. In 1661, Jan Barentse Wemp, an independent farmer-trader, began a lease for a farm with Jan Baptist van Rensselaer, Kiliaen's oldest son and the patroon at the time. The land extended south from the Poesten Kill to the north bank of the Wynants Kill, which empties into the Hudson in South Troy. At the time, residents would commonly go by a recognizable nickname, to distinguish themselves in local records. Wemp went by \\"Poest\\". Add the Dutch word kill, meaning \\"creek\\", and the source of the name Poesten Kill becomes clear.Warren (2009), p. 35 While most of the settlements along or near the Poesten Kill during the Dutch era revolved around farming, some were also based on easy access to the Mohicans for trade in fur. The Indians, likewise, were more than happy to cut their trip by miles, since they would no longer have to go to Fort Orange.Warren (2009), p. 37 At the time, the fur trade was legally monopolized by the Dutch West India Company, so this practice was illegal, but very profitable.Van Laer (1906), p. 47 Rensselaerswyck was taken over by the English in 1664,Reynolds (1906), pp. 66 though the legal existence of the patroonship was not challenged.Warren (2009), p. 39 In the 1600s, a sawmill was built at the base of Poestenkill falls by Jan Barensten Wemple and was passed on to his wife, Marytie Mynderse after his passing. In the 1800s, many mills and factories were built along this river to use water power or have easy access to the Hudson on a riverside road beginning just after Poestenkill Falls. This included a bridge that spanned the creek just after the falls, and this bridge is no longer around but remains of the old factories still can be seen along the north side of the river. Small dirt paths are all that is left of the roads on the north side of the creek between the falls and prospect park.  Dangers of the Falls  The Poestenkill falls have been always been a sight to see for hikers and the public, but there are dangers associated with climbing and being around the fast waters that flow through the creek after floods and winter thaws. Most recently in February 2017, a young man fell went missing and was found dead in the Hudson days later.  The Poestenkill Gorge Today  There are two access points located on each side of the river. A private company has a small power station that still produces electricity from hydro power on the north side of the river that was built in the 1950sPowerHouse Systems - Hydro Projects - Mt. Ida, n.d. http://phshydro.com/mtida.html. and used turbines inside the remains of the concrete foundation of the old industrial mills. A gate blocked the entrance to this access point but since has been removed. This road existed since the 1870s but had been closed off in the 1990s when the city of Troy discontinued maintenance of this park even though it still owns the land. This road leads to a small dirt path tangled with saplings and roots along old industrial remains from the Marshall Factories. This dirt path is where the bridge access road used to be due to the lack of any full grown trees and a clearing. The path splits into two paths, one leading towards the sublime foundation of an old mill with one brick archway standing. Along the northern river bank, there is obvious stone bricks, shale from mill foundations, clay bricks from the old mill inscribed ‚ÄúBleau‚Äù, and steel rods from where bridges and walkways used to traverse and cross the gorge. The bricks inscribed ‚ÄúBleau‚Äù were made in a brick factory in Mechanicville across the HudsonNadeau, Anne Marie. ‚ÄúMy Life in the Brickyard .‚Äù Spindle City Historic Society , 2003. and used to make up a mill from the 1700s. Walking along the riverbank provides no sure footing due to the deposits of rubble and driftwood along the banks. An interesting sight is the rock walls of the waterfalls that indicate all dirt and clay has been washed away by the constant barrage of water. During the spring, melt water and a lack of dam upstream causes the water to flow much more violently and prevents access to most of the waterfall riverbanks.

In addition, its intact Fc-part can bind to an Fc receptor on accessory cells like conventional monospecific antibodies. The net effect is that this type of drug links T cells (via CD3) and monocytes/macrophages, natural killer cells, dendritic cells or other Fc receptor expressing cells to the tumor cells, leading to their destruction. At an equivalent dose a trifunctional antibody is more potent (more than 1,000-fold) in eliminating tumor cells than conventional antibodies. These drugs evoke the removal of tumor cells by means of (i) antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytoxicity, a process also described for conventional antibodies and more importantly by (ii) polyclonal cytotoxic T cell responses with emphasis on CD8 T cells. These trifunctional antibodies also elicit individual anti-tumor immune responses in cancer patients treated with e.g. catumaxomab; i.e. autologous antibodies as well as CD4 and CD8 T cells directed against the tumor were detected. Furthermore, putative cancer stem cells from malignant ascites fluid were eliminated due to catumaxomab treatment. Catumaxomab, was the first to be approved for clinical use (in 2009 for the treatment of malignant ascites in cancer patients). Examples include catumaxomab (EpCAM / CD3), ertumaxomab (HER2/neu / CD3), FBTA05 (CD20 / CD3, proposed trade name Lymphomun) and TRBS07 (GD2 / CD3, proposed trade name Ektomab), drugs against various types of cancer. History Trifunctional antibodies were the first type of bispecific monoclonal antibodies to be produced. The first concepts date back to the mid-1980s. For over twenty years, no such antibody was approved for clinical use, mainly because of manufacturing difficulties. Immunogenicity results from the fact that appropriate parental antibodies are obtained from rat and mice. After application, the patient's immune system usually produces anti-drug antibodies, which represent early indicators for a beneficial clinical outcome. Furthermore, despite the development of anti-drug antibody responses after the first catumaxomab application cycle a repeated cycle of catumaxomab also leads to a treatment success in recurrent malignant ascites. Cross-linking leads to the release of cytokines, resulting in manageable adverse effects like fever, nausea and vomiting, that were generally reversible and mainly related to the immunological mode of action (e.g. catumaxomab). Catumaxomab, which was approved in 2009 for the treatment of malignant ascites in cancer patients, satisfies these conditions. It was the first, and as of May 2011 the only approved one of these antibodies in clinical use. Another way of immunotherapeutic intervention strategies is the exploration of bispecific antibodies with different structures, of which bi- specific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) have been produced since the mid-2000s. Production At first, mouse hybridoma cells whose monoclonal antibodies target one of the desired antigens are produced. Independently, rat hybridoma cells targeting the other antigen are produced. These two cell types are hybridised, yielding hybrid-hybridomas or quadromas, which produce hybrid (trifunctional) antibody as well as pure mouse and pure rat antibody. The trifunctional antibody is extracted chromatographically with protein A. Possible combinations of light and heavy chains in antibodies produced by quadroma cell lines. The seven antibodies on the left have at least one mismatched binding region. Of the three antibodies on the right, two are not hybridised, and the remaining (rightmost) is the desired trifunctional antibody. Mixed-species quadromas produce (nearly) none of the seven mismatched antibodies. Using two different species (mouse and rat) has the advantage that less mismatched antibodies are produced because rat light chains preferably pair with rat heavy chains, and mouse light chains with mouse heavy chains. Single species (mouse/mouse or rat/rat) quadromas, by contrast, produce up to ten different kinds of antibody, most of which have mismatched heavy or light chains, or both.

Career He took up bobsleighing at the age of 28 and in September 2005 he trialled at the University of Bath and won a place in the Europa Cup Team. Just 4 months later he was selected to compete as a driver in the Europa Cup team. After his first successful season, he made his world cup debut as a driver in 2007. He became the British Champion in 2008. In 2011 John won gold and two bronze medals in the Europa Cup in St Moritz and was the first British man to ever do this. Thereafter, Jackson had a meteoric rise through the ranks that meant he was given the nod as the main British driver. Jackson's (now) wife Paula Jackson was also involved in the bobsleigh sport until her retirement from the sport in 2015. She too was recruited while serving in the British Armed Forces, in her instance with the Royal Signals. Paula has admitted several times the huge support that she gets from her family and John Jackson. In June 2014 the couple announced that they were expecting their first child together. Jackson has three daughters from a previous relationship. In January 2014 Jackson led team-mates Joel Fearon, Stuart Benson and Bruce Tasker to a silver medal in the four-man event at the Bobsleigh European Championship. He competed at the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics, guiding his crew to fifth place in the four-man event in 2014, 0.11 seconds off a bronze medal after recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon. In 2017, the British team were upgraded to the bronze medal position after two Russian crews were disqualified for doping violations. Jackson also competed at seven FIBT World Championships, finishing fifth in the four-man event in the 2013 Worlds at St. Moritz. He took a second place in the four-man competition at the Lake Placid round of the 2013‚Äì14 Bobsleigh World Cup, the first podium finish for a British crew for many years.

Governments are often depicted as employing subliminal messages in propaganda: * The novel Freeze Frame by B. David Warner depicts the election of a corrupt president candidate using subliminal advertising to sway the votes in his favor. * The 2001 movie Josie and the Pussycats described a long lasting plot whereby the U.S. government was controlling trends by inserting subliminal messages in popular music. Furthermore, towards the end of the film, a government agent shuts down the operation, saying that subliminal advertising works better in films. The words \\"Josie and the Pussycats is the best movie ever\\" are then spoken rapidly in voice-over and displayed quickly on screen, with the words \\"Join the Army\\" in smaller letters below it. * In the 2005 science fiction movie Serenity, the Alliance uses subliminal messages broadly disseminated in commercials and other video to cause River Tam to go berserk. It only works on River because she was subjected to Alliance training and conditioning. * Programming the Nation? is a documentary that goes in-depth by interviewing experts on subliminal messaging and manipulation in the media. Musicians have been associated with alleged incorporating subliminal messages via the use of Backmasking, including rock bands Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd. Many references deal specifically with the military: * An episode of The Simpsons involved Bart and his friends joining a boy band, the Party Posse. While watching a video for the Party Posse, Lisa notices the phrase \\"Yvan Eht Nioj\\" being repeated continuously by belly-dancers. She plays the video in reverse and finds that it means \\"Join the Navy\\". Also, an Uncle Sam \\"I Want You\\" poster can be seen in the video frame by frame. The joke was that the United States sends subliminal messages in order to recruit people. In addition, the art of \\"superliminal messages\\" was demonstrated to Lisa; a Navy representative leans out a window, sees Lenny Leonard and Carl Carlson, and shouts \\"Hey you! Join the Navy!\\" * In an episode of Malcolm in the Middle titled \\"Reese joins the Army (2)\\", one of the drill sergeants comments about the other's restored confidence in the Army (\\"I guess the subliminal advertising's working after all\\"). His fellow drill sergeant then matter-of-factly states \\"the Army doesn't use subliminal ads\\" and then the pair slowly turn and look at each other. This is not too different from the joke in The Simpsons episode mentioned above, this episode was a joking reference to the low military recruiting numbers in 2004 suggesting that the U.S. military uses such things in a tactic of desperation. * In a 1995 episode of Babylon 5, during a scene which represents a PSA for the Psi Corps, the words \\"Trust the Corps\\" and \\"The Corps is Your Friend\\" appear on screen for four frames. J. Michael Straczynski wanted the audience to recognize the subliminal message; \\"I had my staff find out what constitutes subliminal material‚Äîand it's two frames per second, which is illegal, you can't do things at that speed--so I went four frames per second\\". * An early episode of The X-Files deals with a small town plagued by killings where the perpetrators are influenced by messages appearing on ATMs and other electronic devices. Mulder refers to the use of subliminal messages in several instances. * The Family Guy episode Mr. Griffin Goes to Washington jokes about subliminal messages for smoking in television. It shows an old black and white TV show whose dialogue is repeatedly interrupted by a suited man stating \\"Smoke\\" and later \\"Are you smoking yet?\\" in a monotone voice. Later in the episode, when Peter is arguing with his bosses about smoking, the same man interrupts while saying \\"Smoke.\\" * The advertising element is mocked in Terry Pratchett's Discworld novel Moving Pictures, when, to please a sponsor, a movie producer inserts a still image lasting several minutes of a serving of spare ribs. The producer reasoned that if showing just a few frames would have a positive impact, showing it for several minutes would have a huge effect. * Subliminal psychological influence is also referenced frequently by the British mentalist Derren Brown who claims its use as the basis of some of his effects. His declared methods are often decoys to divert attention from the real workings of his effects. *In the episode \\"With Fans Like These...\\" of the animated TV show Kappa Mikey, Lily and Gonard threaten Guano made the public do their bidding by using subliminal messages in a fish stick commercial. * The television show Chuck has a plot which is based around subliminal encoding. The main character receives an e-mail in which thousands and thousands of pictures flash right before his eyes, resulting in an ability to 'mind flash' on certain things, for example a ring or a picture of someone. * In an episode of The IT Crowd, Douglas attempts to seduce Jen by putting a quick flash of his photo into a presentation. * Sue Townsend's 1992 novel/play The Queen and I is based on an alternate reality in which a leftist government takes power in the UK by the use of subliminal messages via television. * The entire plot of Thomas Stratton's \\"Man From U. N. C. L. E. #12: The Mind- Twisters Affair\\" is based upon the idea of subliminal messages. * In novel called \\"Quiller Barracuda,\\" in the popular series about the fictional English intelligence officer who uses the cryptonym Quiller, the character contends with a plot by foreign economic interests to influence US presidential election results by using television commercials altered to include subliminal messages. * In the popular Tripod trilogy of science fiction books for children written by John Christopher, some and yet not all of the books indicate that subliminal messaging via television was key part of the alien invasion strategy used by the race that humans knew only as \\"the Masters.\\" Christopher later write a prequel to the series, and the TV program in question was identified as \\"The Trippy Show, a show apparently aimed at young people.\\" * The episode Gary Takes a Bath of the Nickelodeon series SpongeBob SquarePants had a scene based on Subliminal Stimuli. SpongeBob planned to assault Gary's mind with Subliminals. It showed images of a shower head, a bath, and soap. After those, it cut to an image of a laughing girl. After that, it cut back to SpongeBob and Gary, with SpongeBob saying \\"Sorry you had to see that one.\\". * In the Gravity Falls episode Boyz Crazy, Wendy breaks up with Robbie, and he plays a song for her, and she falls back in love with him. Dipper and Stan play the song backward, revealing a subliminal message \\"You are now under my control. Your mind is mine.\\" They then play the reversed song for Wendy and she breaks up with him again. * In The Amazing World of Gumball episode The Spoiler, Anais puts on a Japanese program and asks Gumball if he'll take her to the movies. For one frame the program flashes \\"YES\\". Gumball says no. Anais asks, \\"But what about the subliminal message?\\" Gumball answers, \\"I don't understand Japanese.\\" References Popular psychology ","title":"Subliminal messages in popular culture"},{"id":"25092424","text":"These are instances of subliminal messages that have led to controversy and occasionally legal allegations. *In 1978, Wichita, Kansas television station KAKE-TV received special permission from the police to place a subliminal message in a report on the BTK Killer (Bind, Torture, Kill) in an effort to get him to turn himself in. The subliminal message included the text \\"Now call the chief\\", as well as a pair of glasses. The glasses were included because when BTK murdered Nancy Fox, there was a pair of glasses lying upside down on her dresser; police felt that seeing the glasses might stir up remorse in the killer. The attempt was unsuccessful, and police reported no increased volume of calls afterward. *During the 2000 U.S. presidential campaign, a television ad advertising for Republican candidate George W. Bush showed words (and parts thereof) scaling from the foreground to the background on a television screen. When the word flashed on the screen, one frame showed only the last part, .Smoking Pistols: George \\"Rat Ad\\" Bush and the Subliminal Kid The FCC looked into the matter, but no penalties were ever assessed in the case. *In the British alternative comedy show The Young Ones, a number of subliminal images were present in the original and most repeated broadcasts of the second series. Images included a tern coming into land, a tree frog jumping through the air, a man gurning, and the end credits of the film Carry On Cowboy. These were included to mock the then-occurring matter of subliminal messages in television. These images do appear in the U.S. boxset DVD Every Stoopid Episode. *Shaun Micallef's Australian Micallef P(r)ogram(me) shows contained strange subliminal messages that can be seen on the DVDs. As they are of random, humorous statements, questions, etc., they are not regarded as advertising. They were usually images of politicians, as is the case with his more recent Newstopia. *In Warner Brothers' 1943 animated film \\"Wise Quacking Duck\\", Daffy Duck spins a statue which is holding a shield. For one frame the words \\"BUY BONDS\\" are visible on the shield.IMDB \\"The Wise Quacking Duck\\" Trivia *The December 16, 1973 episode of Columbo, titled \\"Double Exposure\\", is based on subliminal messaging: it is used by the murderer, Dr. Bart Keppler, a motivational research specialist, played by Robert Culp, to lure his victim out of his seat during the viewing of a promotional film and by Lt. Columbo to bring Keppler back to the crime scene and incriminate him. Lt. Columbo is shown how subliminal cuts work in a scene mirroring James Vicary's experiment. *The horror film The Exorcist is well known for its frightening yet effective use of subliminal images throughout the film, depicting a white-faced demon named Captain Howdy. This image is shown in the character Father Karras's nightmare, where it flashes across the screen for a few seconds before fading away. *A McDonald's logo appeared for one frame during the Food Network's Iron Chef America series on 2007-01-27, leading to claims that this was an instance of subliminal advertising. The Food Network replied that it was simply a glitch. *In Formula One racing, the paint scheme of many cars would carry messages intended to look as if they were of banned tobacco products in many Grands Prix where tobacco advertising was banned, though many of these were jokes on the part of the teams (for example, Jordan Grand Prix ran Benson and Hedges sponsorship as \\"Bitten and Hisses\\" with a snake-skin design on their cars). A similar procedure was used by NASCAR driver Jeff Burton after the AT&T; Mobility advertising was banned by a court order in 2007, and by Penske Championship Racing in NASCAR (where Cellco Partnership is prohibited) and the IRL (Marlboro). In both instances, a distinctive design where the banned company's identity (the Verizon \\"V\\" and the Marlboro chevron) were integrated into the car's design. *On November 7, 2007, Network Ten Australia's broadcast of the ARIA Awards was called out for using subliminal advertising in an expos√© by the Media Watch program on the ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation). *In June‚ÄìJuly 2007, Sprite used a type of obvious subliminal message, involving yellow (lemon) and green (lime) objects such as cars. The objects would then be shown inconspicuously in the same setting, while showing the word \\"lymon\\" (combining the words lime and lemon) on screen for a second at a time. They called this \\"Sublymonal Advertising.\\" The previous year, Sprite used a similar advertising campaign, but this time it was tied into Lost Experience, an alternate reality game. *In Sunshine (2007), five pictures of the crew are shown subliminally during part of the film. *In Brainiac: Science Abuse, there is an experiment carried out to see if viewers would react to subliminal messages. One was shown during an experiment to discover which substance provides the best skid; the message appeared when a brainiac hit a bale of hay. The second message appeared across a T-shirt of a brainiac saying 'Call your mum', and the third said 'scratch your nose' when a sound wave hit the Brainiac logo. At the end of the show, people were shown in a theatre watching that episode. The test showed that the messages barely impacted the audience. The subliminal content in this episode was legal, as its presence was announced at the beginning and end of the episode. *In Week 11 of The Apprentice: Martha Stewart in which candidates have to create an ad for the Delta's former low-cost commercial airlines Song, the team Matchstick used a 1/48th-frame image at the bottom-right corner with the Song Airlines logo. *In the film Cloverfield, three subliminal pictures can be seen during various parts of the film, when the camera footage distorts. The photos are actually frames from classic monster films. The images are shown one at a time: the first, from Them!, appears when the group play the footage back, the second, from The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, appears when they close the door on the 'parasites' and the third, from King Kong appears when the helicopter crashes. A monstrous creature can also be seen at the top right corner (with its mouth slightly open) as one of the clouds over the Statue of Liberty on the release cover. *In an episode of British TV show QI based on hypnosis, host Stephen Fry suggested that he could use subliminal messages to get himself elected as the Pope. The words \\"Stephen Fry for Pope\\" then briefly flashed up on the screen. This was repeated later on in the episode. *In the episode \\"Men Without Women\\" of The IT Crowd, there is a scene where the character Douglas is trying to seduce Jen by showing her a film about his company on his laptop which featured a subliminal message of Douglas lying in bed. Jen saw the image but suspected the image meant something was wrong with his laptop. During the credits of the episode, the same image flashes briefly as a subliminal message. *In the \\"Bull\\" television series episode \\"Bad Medicine\\" on CBS 03//27/2018, an advertisement for Cuties citrus fruit was flashed on the screen in one frame. *In the very beginning of the vampire movie Blade, an image of a cut throat is flashed in the scene where the protagonists are crossing the cold room that precedes the club room, thus generating apprehension. *In the JJ Villard's Fairy Tales tv show, every episode has four to five images or texts written in bloody words with positive messages, random quotes or devilish artwork at random one frames.

Among early Christians, the savoring of blessed salt often took place along with baptism. In the fourth century, Augustine of Hippo named these practices \\"visible forms of invisible grace\\".Tad W. Guzie, 1982 The book of sacramental basics page 46Everett Ferguson, 2009 Baptism in the Early Church: History, Theology, and Liturgy page 768 However, its modern use as a sacramental remains mostly limited to its use with holy water within the Anglican Communion and Roman Catholic Church. History In the Old Testament, in , \\"David struck down 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.\\" In addition, \\"tells the story of the prophet Elisha pouring salt onto Jericho's water springs.\\" For centuries since the advent of Jesus, salt that had been cleansed and sanctified by special exorcisms and prayers was given to catechumens before entering the church for baptism. According to the fifth canon of the Third Council of Carthage in the third century, salt was administered to the catechumens several times a year, a process attested by Augustine of Hippo (Confessions I.11). Two specific rites, namely a cross traced on the forehead and a taste of blessed salt, not only marked the entrance into the catechumenate, but were repeated regularly. By his own account, Augustine was \\"blessed regularly with the Sign of the Cross and was seasoned with God's salt.\\"William Harmless, 1995 Augustine and the Catechumenate page 80 Early in the sixth century, John the Deacon also explained the use of blessed salt, \\"so the mind which is drenched and weakened by the waves of this world is held steady\\".Aidan Kavanagh, 1991 The Shape of Baptism: The Rite of Christian Initiation ISBN page 59 Salt continued to be customarily used during the scrutinies of catechumens or the baptism of infants. Current use In recent times, the use of blessed salt is found within some Anglican liturgies of Holy Baptism, and in the blessing of holy water, sometimes called lustral water.Michno, Dennis G. (1998) [1983]. A Priest's Handbook: Ceremonies of the Church. \\"A Form for Blessing Holy Water\\". Harrisburg, PA; New York: Morehouse Publishing. p. 266. Notes that, \\"traditionally, a little salt is added to it.\\" The Anglican Missal, used by some Anglo-Catholics, in The Order of Blessing Water, includes an English translation of traditional prayers for the exorcism and blessing of salt. The Collect reads: In the section on Occasional Offices of the Book of Common Prayer, the following prayer, given under the rite for Blessing of Holy Water is said before the holy water is blessed and \\"salt is put into the water in the form of a cross\\": The Roman Rite of the Catholic Church also mentions use of blessed salt.Catholic encyclopedia on salt The 1962 Rituale Romanum includes salt as component in three rites: *Baptism: Before the candidates enter the church or baptistry, salt is blessed with an exorcism, and a pinch can be put in the mouth of the candidates. However, in modern practice this can be skipped. *Reconsecration of an altar: In one rite for the reconsecration of an altar which has been disturbed, salt is exorcized, blessed, and mixed with ashes, water and wine, the resulting mixture being used to make the mortar with which the altar is resealed. *Blessing holy water: Salt is added to water in silence after a prayer in which God is asked to bless the salt, recalling the blessed salt \\"scattered over the water by the prophet Elisha\\" and invoking the protective powers of salt and water, that they may \\"drive away the power of evil\\".Peter M. J. Stravinskas, 1998 Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Encyclopedia page 893 An additional rite provides for the blessing of salt for animals. Blessed salt is also used in prayer services of Pentecostal churches, such as the Apostolic Church Fullness of God's Throne in Brasil. Salt as sacramental Salt may also be blessed for use as a sacramental, using the same prayer as is used during the preparation of holy water. This salt may be sprinkled in a room, or across a threshold, or in other places as an invocation of divine protection. This will keep demons and possessed persons away from a home and crossing a line made of salt. It may also be consumed.3 Powerful sacramentals to have in your home, Aleteia, 2017 References Further reading * The Roman Ritual (Rituale Romanum), Vol 2: Christian Burial, Exorcism, Reserved Blessings.

Origins  Will Price started Hermes while in 10th grade at boarding school and released it the following year. Hermes became very widely used by a large number of Macintosh BBS systems due to several factors including multi-line support and ease of use. Early in the development of Hermes, Will Price contacted Wayne Bell the author of WWIV BBS for MS-DOS for permission to use the \\"look and feel\\" of WWIV in Hermes without actually using any of the source code. Wayne gave the go ahead which meant that Will was able to use a best of breed text based interface for users while building an easy to use management interface on top of that for Macintosh-based Sysops. This factor gave Hermes a very familiar feel to most of the popular BBSs that existed on the PC side of the world while providing a Macintosh GUI management interface which was unique for the time in the BBS world. Hermes also featured an application programming interface (API) for external application developers to extend the system. Hundreds of \\"externals\\" were written for Hermes providing extended functionality, games, sysop management tools, etc., and Olympus also served as a central location to download externals. Hermes was written in Lightspeed Pascal, an early development environment for Macintosh. Over the course of its first few years, Hermes customers included thousands of sysops. Many customers from teenagers running BBSs in a bedroom to companies to governments would use Hermes. Will Price copied and framed a check from the CIA purchasing Hermes. He has no idea what their intent was in using Hermes. Hermes became the flag bearer of the Macintosh side of the BBS community as the sister product to WWIV.  Post-Internet Evolution  In 1991, Will Price sold the Hermes rights and code to Lloyd Woodall, one of the more active sysops of a Hermes BBS who believed that his son could continue the development of Hermes. Will Price wanted to move on and create a next generation BBS system with a dynamic graphical user interface no longer based on simple text. Will Price and Mark Weaver, one of the authors of another piece of software called NovaLink, joined forces to create that system, but the development was simply too great a task. The vision of MDX, the successor to Hermes, as it was called internally, was similar to that of the web, but 2 college students just could not complete that task in a reasonable time frame before the web came into being. The technology developed as part of that effort eventually became a piece of software called MacIntercomm acquired by New World Computing as Macintosh communications software for connecting to BBS systems. No technology from Hermes was carried over into the new company. In 1998, after Hermes languished with very little development since the 1991 sale, Lloyd Woodall sold the rights to Hermes to Michael Alyn Miller. Michael made many contributions to Hermes including adding telnet support for logging in via the Internet, and support for Python based externals. On May 27, 2013, Michael Alyn Miller announced on his blog that he was releasing Hermes II as open source BBS software. The source code for Hermes II 3.5.11 is freely available for download and compilation on the GitHub website. A detailed, in- depth Hermes II 3.5.11 compilation guide is likewise freely offered by the Armageddon BBS website. Hermes was developed as a \\"classic\\" Mac OS application, so cannot run natively on Mac OS X or Intel Macintosh hardware. However, the Armageddon BBS website also offers detailed instructions for running Hermes II 3.5.11 in a virtual environment, using VirtualBox virtualization software for Mac OS X and the SheepShaver Mac Classic emulator. The type of setup described in this tutorial will keep a Hermes II BBS running indefinitely, and immune to any future Mac OS X updates, as long as VirtualBox is kept updated and compatible with the latest OS X release from Apple.

He was considered a scholarly genius by his teachers and peers alike. His research papers, particularly in the field of vibration, are still cited by international research fellows in Engineering as lately as the year 2020, and are archived by such publishers as the Royal Society. Early life Born in Oshodi, Lagos State, Awojobi's father, Chief Daniel Adekoya Awojobi, was a stationmaster at the Nigerian Railway Corporation who hailed from Ikorodu in Lagos State. His mother, Comfort Bamidele Awojobi (n√©e Adetunji), was a petty trader who hailed from Modakeke, Ile-Ife, Osun State. Between 1942 and 1947, he attended St. Peter's Primary School, Faji, Lagos. It was while at his secondary school, the CMS Grammar School, Lagos, that his academic traits began to manifest. Not only was he seen to be gifted in mathematics and the sciences, he was comfortable also in the arts, becoming a member of the school's literary and debating society. It was during this period that he earned the nickname, \\"Macbeth\\": William Shakespeare's famous play, Macbeth, was to be staged in the school. The lead actor took ill a week before, and so Ayodele was called upon to play the lead role in his stead. It is said that not only did Ayodele master his lines as lead actor, but also the entire play, such that he was able to prompt the cast whenever they forgot their lines. Academic achievements Ayodele was a straight-A's secondary school student, while at the CMS Grammar school, passing his West African School Certificate examinations with a record eight distinctions in 1955. He proceeded to the Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology, Ibadan, for his General Certificate of Examinations, GCE (Advanced Level), where in 1958 he sat for, and obtained distinctions in all his papers: Physics, Pure Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. In 1962 Awojobi was awarded his first degree in mechanical engineering ‚Äì a BSc (Eng) London, with first class honours, at the then Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology, Zaria (now Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria). He had studied there on a federal government scholarship won on the merit of his performance in the GCE (Advanced-level) examinations of 1958. It was said by Akintola Ajai (himself an engineering graduate of the University of London), that when Awojobi arrived at the Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology, Zaria, he boasted openly saying that it was his intention to finish the whole course within a period of three years only; an impracticable feat due to the fact that nowhere was the BSc Mechanical Engineering curriculum designed to run less than four years. Ayodele accomplished it in three years just as he had predicted. The federal government awarded Awojobi another scholarship in 1962 to study further at the post-graduate level in the field of Mechanical Engineering at the Imperial College of the University of London (now Imperial College London). He completed the course, successfully defending his thesis, and was awarded a PhD in mechanical engineering in 1966. Landmark degree award After a period teaching at the University of Lagos, he returned to the Imperial College London for a research study in the field of Vibration, and was awarded the degree of Doctor of Science, DSc. He was the first African to be awarded the Doctor of Science degree in mechanical engineering, at the Imperial College London. The first university to admit an individual to this degree was the University of London in 1860.Francis Michael Longstreth Thompson, The University of London and the World of Learning, 1836‚Äì1986, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1990, pp. xiii and xiv. Educator On his return from England in 1966 Awojobi enrolled as a lecturer in the Faculty of Engineering, University of Lagos, Akoka. His teaching methods endeared him to his engineering students, whose public chants: \\"Dead easy... Dead easy...\\", would often be heard shouted in his direction as he went along the campus grounds. He quickly rose in the ranks among his colleagues and would later become the Head of Department, Mechanical Engineering, University of Lagos. Awojobi went back to London to study for his Doctorate. He returned in 1974 and was made an associate professor in mechanical engineering at the University of Lagos. However, one week after having been appointed associate professor, the University of Lagos Senate, after receiving news that Awojobi had just been awarded the degree of Doctor of Science (DSc), immediately appointed him professor in mechanical engineering, making him the youngest professor in the Faculty of Engineering, University of Lagos and the first ever to be expressly promoted from associate to full professorship within a week. By nature, Ayodele Awojobi was a teacher. He imparted knowledge at various other levels, even as he contended with his day job as a full-time professor and university lecturer. He envisaged his country as a whole becoming more advanced, technologically ‚Äì this was exemplified when he refused lucrative offers from commercial outfits for his Autonov 1 invention, he rather preferring to preserve his design for his country's future benefit. He engaged with great educators of his, and earlier generations, such as the late nationalist and Yoruba leader, Obafemi Awolowo (who forwarded several of Ayodele's educational books), the late activist, social crusader and educator, Tai Solarin, and the once Lagos State governor, Lateef Kayode Jakande, who achieved free education at all educational levels in Lagos State, Nigeria. Jakande believed in Awolowo's visionary ideas about the way forward for the nation, particularly in Awolowo's resounding theme of qualitative and quantitative education across the nation, free of over-bearing school fees. Ayodele Awojobi became, at one time, the chairman, Lagos State School's Management Board, out of his concern for ways to better improve the problems inherent in secondary school education in Lagos State, Nigeria. He desired that all his children go to public schools. The older ones all did. Such was his vision and hope that the country would some day attain equitable distribution in the quality of education cutting across different social strata. He authored several books for both the secondary and tertiary levels of education in Nigeria. His natural propensity to inform, to educate, drove him to become, in the early 1970s, a quiz-master on national television. The quiz-show, Mastermind, consisted of weekly contestants taking turns in isolation on \\"the hot-seat\\", whereupon various categories of questions would be thrown at them. Otunba Gbenga Daniel, former governor of Ogun State, Nigeria, was a returning winner and champion on Mastermind for several episodes over; he being in his undergraduate years at the time. Inventor Autonov 1 on display at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Lagos. While as a lecturer in the University of Lagos, Awojobi successfully converted his own family car, an Opel Olympia Rekord, from right-hand drive to a left-hand drive. He tinkered further with motor engines when he acquired an army-type jeep and proceeded to invent a second steering-wheel mechanism, adjoined to the pre-existing engine at the rear end, so that the vehicle was able to move in both forward and backward directions with all four pre-existing gears. This gave the hybrid vehicle, which he christened Autonov 1, the ability to achieve its highest speeds at a moment's notice, in the normal reverse direction. He highlighted the advantage this might offer to army vehicles, as an example, that might need to make a fast retreat, in a cul-de-sac or ambush situation. Activist Ayodele Awojobi, in the wake of the presidential election results that returned the incumbent, Shehu Shagari as president in the Second Nigerian Republic, became very vocal in the national newspapers and magazines, going as far as suing the Federal Government of Nigeria for what he strongly believed was a widespread election rigging. With all his court cases against the Nigerian government thrown out of court, he delved into the law books, himself being only a mechanical engineer, claiming that he would earn his law degrees in record time, to enable him better argue with the opposition at the federal courts. He used the universities as a bastion, going from campus to campus to make speeches at student-rallies, hoping to sensitise them to what he perceived as the ills of a corrupt government. Ayodele Awojobi authored several political books over the course of his ideological struggles against a perceived, corrupt federal government. These books were usually made available during his public rallies or symposiums. Political ambition Any intention Ayodele Awojobi ever had of entering partisan politics, was revealed by the man himself when he spoke on national television, saying: \\"At the age of 65, I will have built the infrastructure. There would be very few illiterates in Nigeria when I mount the soapbox. Then, I will go into proper politics\\". Death Ayodele Awojobi statue. Ayodele Awojobi died in the morning of Sunday, 23 September 1984, at the age of 47. His death made headline news in most of the national newspapers for days following and he was laid to rest at Ikorodu Cemetery, Lagos. He was survived by his wife, Mrs Iyabode Mabel Awojobi (n√©e Odetunde), and children. Tribute Usually every year till date, a tribute or two in Ayodele's honour would be published in the form of an article in a national newspaper, such as the one published by The Nation on 5 November 2009, entitled \\"Tribute to Ayodele Awojobi\\". In October 2009, the governor of Lagos State Babatunde Fashola dedicated a statue of Awojobi at Onike Roundabout, Yaba, Lagos, in a garden named after him. On 23 September 2010, Birrel Street ‚Äì a prominent street in Yaba Local Government Council Area ‚Äì was renamed \\"Prof. Ayodele Awojobi Avenue\\", a further tribute to Awojobi's memory.

All the while Obie shows interest in his dad's watch, who eventually gives it to him. Later that morning in school, Obie's mom (Brynn Thayer) arrives to tell him that his dad is in the hospital. The family learns that he suffered a massive heart attack, which he dies from days later. Arriving at school Obie is reminded of the way his dad took him to school when he sees a father drop his son off. Upset, Obie leaves school and runs away on his bike. Having left the suburbs Obie finds himself on the South Side of Chicago. There, Obie is lured into a lot where he is attacked and robbed of his bike and watch. A boy named Scam (Darius McCrary), an 11-year-old street hustler, befriends him and aids Obie in retrieving his watch. Scam takes Obie to a bar where they greet a man named Johnnie Red (Paul Winfield). Scam believes he bought the watch from Obie's muggers, Johnnie Red denies it at first, but later he tells them he did have it but gave it to a man named Keegan (Robert Prosky), a slick pawn shop owner. Scam and Obie go to visit Keegan, and it is there at his pawn shop where Obie finds his watch. But Keegan has put it on display to be sold. They leave promising Keegan they will get him the money. Instead of going home Obie stays the night with Scam, who lives at a hotel managed by a Miss Hanks (Beah Richards). As they are heading to Scam's room a hit man named Doc (Jerzy Skolimowski), and his assistant Dickie (Robert Joy), are looking for a man who runs out the door seconds later with Doc and Dickie chasing him. The next morning, Doc and Dickie return to the hotel having caught their mark, killed him, and stuffed his body in the trunk of their car, a dark gray colored Mercedes-Benz. Using Obie as an accomplice Scam steals the car, and they both drive to the bank to get the money for Obie's watch, with both unaware of the body in the trunk. After leaving the bank Obie has Scam to take him home to check on his family. While there, they learn that Obie's mother has reported him missing to the police. Having discovered their car stolen, Doc and Dickie begin offering a reward for its recovery. Obie and Scam return to the pawn shop to buy back Obie's watch. However, Keegan stiffs them by taking the money and refusing to give Obie his watch. Plus he makes a horrible comment about Obie's dad, sending him running out the pawn shop upset. Despite this, the boys are determined to get back Obie's watch. Back at Scam's room, they get cap guns to use to scare Keegan. On the way out they have an encounter with Dickie, then overhear Doc asking about their missing car, leading them to hide it. Later, they burst into Keegan's pawn shop, pointing their cap guns, demanding Keegan give Obie his watch. But Keegan hits his silent alarm. Convinced that the guns are toys he dares them to shoot him. Squeezing the trigger, Obie fires a live round, revealing the gun Obie has is real.

Having only his father's old driver's license, Scam vows to find him. At this point, Obie now considers Scam his friend as he heads home. The next morning, the Dawkins is visited by the police to find out what happened to Obie. Obie lies, claiming he caught amnesia and does not remember. Not wanting to mention his bike was stolen Obie has his mom take him to school. While at school Obie starts thinking about Scam and decides that for all he has done for him he would help find his father. The next morning Obie steals the family jeep and returns to the hotel to look for Scam. Miss Hanks tells him that a social worker came and placed Scam in a home. After he visits the social worker and finds out where Scam is, Obie finds the jeep swarmed with police looking for him. Determined to help Scam he gets the Mercedes out of hiding and enlists the help of Johnnie Red. Though hesitant at first, Johnnie Red agrees to help him.

Running across the road, a semi-trailer truck swerves and crashes into the cars on the lot. Doc tries to run, but the chain reaction of car crashes sets off an explosion, killing him. As Obie and Scam escape motorists spot an armed Dickie, subdue him, and hold him for the police. Opening the trunk of the Mercedes, the police discover the body of the man they killed. Dickie begins claiming innocence and informs the police about the kids that stole the car. Obie and Scam reach a car ferry to take them across the river.

The village is situated on the B709 road south of Innerleithen at .  History  Traquair, said to mean \\"hamlet on the Quair Water\\", a river which runs northwards from the hill, Slake Law () to drain into the River Tweed north of Traquair. The village was once surrounded by the great Ettrick Forest and is surrounded by many hills in excess of The area was renowned for the rearing of Cheviot sheep. In early times the village bore the name Kirkbryde or Strathquair, the Kirkbryde coming from the local church which was dedicated to St. Bride, or Bridget. As early as the 12th century, Traquair was of some importance, important enough to be raised to the status of a Sheriffdom. One of the earliest mentions of the area came in 1107 when Traquair House or Tower was known as a hunting lodge of the Scottish kings and as a refuge for priests. The house was known as Traquair Palace and, in 1176, at the palace, William I of Scotland granted a charter for the erection of a burgh with the power to hold markets every Thursday. Steekit Yetts ('Stuck Gates') of Traquair House The burgh which was erected that year at Traquair is known now as the City of Glasgow. Traquair House was one of a string of towers built along the line of the River Tweed as defence of the borderlands against English invasion. The lands of Traquair were granted by King Robert the Bruce to Sir James Douglas, Lord of Douglas. The manor was later in the hands of the Murray family, the Douglas of Cluny then the Boyds before becoming forfeit to the crown. Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany is said to have granted the lands to William Watson in a charter signed at Edinburgh in 1409. In 1469, there was uproar when James III of Scotland granted the estates to Dr William Rogers. Rogers only lived there a few years before selling it to James Stewart, 1st Earl of Buchan. Rogers, reputed to be a friend and court musician to the king, sold the house to Buchan for 70 Scots merks (less than four pounds in today's money). The earl gave the manor of Traquair to his son, also James, who later died at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513. The estate was elevated in status in 1633 when John was elevated to the title of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Traquair; he later became Lord High Treasurer of Scotland but was later attainted and died penniless. The last of the family, Lady Louisa Stewart, died aged 99 in 1875 and the lands of Traquair passed to her kinsman, Henry Maxwell. Henry adopted the name Stuart and the Maxwell Stuarts still live at the house today. Modern-day Traquair House is an acclaimed visitor attraction, brewery, wedding venue, corporate hospitality and conference centre. Prince Charles Edward Stewart ‚Äì also known as Bonnie Prince Charlie A legend, in two versions, applies to the 'Steekit Yetts' (stuck, or closed, gates), formerly the main entrance of Traquair House. Prince Charles Edward Stewart visited the family during the Jacobite rising of 1745. On his departure, the 5th earl declared the gates would never open again until a Stewart monarch required entry to the house. The second version belongs to the 7th earl who deemed the gates stay closed after the death of his wife, in 1796, and not to re-open until there was another Countess of Traquair. The Duke of Montrose visited Traquair in 1645 after the Battle of Philiphaugh. Then Robert Burns came to Traquair in order to see a then-famous thicket of beech trees known as the 'Bush aboon Traquair'. A considerable village in the early 18th century, Traquair boasted no less than six alehouses but the local minister stated the locals drank to excess. By the end of the century there was only one pub and the population was said to have halved during that century. At one point, at the same time, there was talk of building a road through Traquair to become the main route between Edinburgh and Carlisle. An Edinburgh man had even offered to fund the building of a new bridge over the River Tweed but the plans never came to fruition and the local roads stayed in a very poor state. A toll bar was built in an attempt to raise funds for roads but was not successful.  Church  Traquair Kirk There is reputed to have been a religious establishment at Traquair since 1116, in the See of St. Kentigern of Glasgow. It was dedicated to St. Bride whose holy well was in the glebe. The present church building was built in 1778 on top of those ancient and historic foundations.  Today  Present-day Traquair is still a straggling hamlet with only 79 houses and fewer than 200 inhabitants. The parish had a population of 566 at the 2001 census. With no pubs, the centre of activity in the village is the village hall where various local clubs and associations meet. The social gatherings of Traquair are also held in the atmospheric little hall. The hall's committee have adopted an open doors policy and don't cater only for the villagers but for the wider populace too. The Sir Walter Scott Way long-distance path passes through Traquair.

Sometimes known as Fran√ßoise de Merc≈ìur, she belonged to the Merc≈ìur cadet branch of the sovereign Dukes of Lorraine and was a niece of Louise of Lorraine, wife of the previous King Henry III. Fran√ßoise was the heiress of her father and, as such, was the Duchess of Merc≈ìur and Penthi√®vre suo jure. Biography Engraved portrait of C√©sar de Bourbon, Duke of Vend√¥me (1594‚Äì1665) Fran√ßoise was the younger of two children. She was born in November 1592 with the exact date unknown; her only sibling, Philippe Louis, died in 1590 aged one making her the heiress to a large private fortune. During the reign of Henry III, her father had put himself at the head of the Catholic League in Brittany, and had himself proclaimed protector of the Roman Catholic Church in the province in 1588. Invoking the hereditary rights of his wife, who was a descendant of the Dukes of Brittany, he endeavoured to make himself independent in that province, and organised a government at Nantes, calling his son \\"prince and duke of Brittany\\". Coat of arms as Duchess of Vend√¥me With the aid of the Spaniards he defeated Henri de Bourbon, Duke of Montpensier, whom Henry IV of France had sent against him, at Craon in 1592. The king marched against Meroeur in person. As part of their peace they drew up a marriage contract in 1596 whereby his daughter, would marry Henry's legitimised son. The French and Spanish then signed the Peace of Vervins on 2 May 1598 when Fran√ßoise was 6; part of the treaty again stipulated that the young Fran√ßoise would be engaged to the illegitimate child of Henry IV, C√©sar de Bourbon, Duke of Vend√¥me. Vend√¥me was the eldest child of the King and his mistress Gabrielle d'Estr√©es. The wedding took place at the palace of Fontainebleau on 16 July 1609. The bride was 16, the groom 15. The couple had three children and were the paternal grandparents of le Grand Vend√¥me. Due to the marriage contract, C√©sar acquired the right to manage her lands. Her husband died disgraced in 1665, having been involved in the Fronde and having been accused of trying to poison Cardinal Richelieu. In the same year she went to Savoy with her granddaughter Marie Jeanne of Savoy, who wed Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy on 20 May 1665. The duchies of Merc≈ìur and Penthi√®vre were inherited by her eldest son. Fran√ßoise died in Paris in 1669 aged 77 and was buried there. Other fiefs that Fran√ßoise owned were the princedom of Martigues, the duchy of √âtampes and the seigneurie of Ancenis.

He was married to opera singer and actress Rosa Rey. Biography Garralaga first came to the United States when he sailed from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, to San Juan, Puerto Rico, on the steamship Catherine in April 1924.ancestry.com entry He portrayed more than two hundred roles in film and television and is probably best known for his portrayal as \\"Pancho\\" in the early Cisco Kid films. In 1958, Garralaga was cast as Ramirez in the episode \\"A Tree for Planting\\" of the CBS western television series, The Texan. Lurene Tuttle and Paul Fix were cast in the episode as Amy Bofert and Bert Gorman, respectively. In the storyline, series character Bill Longley (Rory Calhoun) comes to the aid of a distressed Mexican farmer, Ramirez, whose peach orchards are being overrun by cattle ranchers. Garralaga appeared as Father Mariano, a mission priest, in the 1954 episode \\"The Saint's Portrait\\" of the syndicated anthology series Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the story line, a painting of Saint Joseph is thought by a tribe and its covetous neighbor to be magical. However, Father Mariano reveals its deeper meaning. The episode also starred Rico Alaniz, George J. Lewis, Eugenia Paul, and Chief Thundercloud. In 1955, he appeared as Mr. Delgado on the TV Western Cheyenne in the episode \\"Border Showdown.\\" Garralaga died at the age of 86 in Woodland Hills, a part of Los Angeles.

It is located in the borough of Hinna between the neighborhoods of J√•tt√•, Godeset, and Forus and the Gandsfjorden.  History  Gausel Church Until the 1980s, Gausel was primary farmland. From the 1990s onwards, increased settlement has taken place, and new service facilities have been built. The Gausel Church was built in 1996. The Stavanger branch of the cash management company NOKAS was relocated to Gausel, after the robbery incident in central Stavanger in 2004. The J√¶ren Line, a railway line that is part of the S√∏rland Line, passes through Gausel. Gausel Station was operative from 1902 and until the mid-1960s. The old station was taken down and a new station was constructed and it opened in December 2009. It is one of the four railway stations that are part of the new double track between Stavanger and Sandnes, which opened in November 2009. Nature reserve The nature reserve Gauselskogen is an old forested area located at Gausel. It covers an area of , and was established as a nature reserve by law in 1984. It is a broad-leaf forest, mainly oaks, but also elms, maples, beech, and hazels, a mixture of large trees and undergrowth giving rise to a rich birdlife. Archaeological site At the western side of Gauselskogen is an archaeological site, with most notably a rich woman's grave dating from the Viking era. The grave, also called a \\"queen's grave\\", was discovered in 1883, and is regarded among the richest women's graves from the Viking era. Several objects found in 1883 showed Irish heritage (Vikings ruled parts of Ireland during various historical periods). About forty objects were registered, including silver and bronze clasps, silver arm rings, a finger-ring, pearls, knives, a bit and furnishings, cooking equipment, and parts of a reliquary. The objects are part of the collections at Bergen Museum. New examinations of the location were done in 1997.

Friedman and Werner Stuetzle which is an extension of additive models. This model adapts the additive models in that it first projects the data matrix of explanatory variables in the optimal direction before applying smoothing functions to these explanatory variables.  Model overview  The model consists of linear combinations of ridge funtions: non- linear transformations of linear combinations of the explanatory variables. The basic model takes the form :y_i=\\\\beta_0 + \\\\sum_{j=1}^r f_j (\\\\beta_j^{\\\\mathrm{T}}x_i) + \\\\varepsilon , where xi is a 1 √ó p row of the design matrix containing the explanatory variables for example i, yi is a 1 √ó 1 prediction, {Œ≤j} is a collection of r vectors (each a unit vector of length p) which contain the unknown parameters, {fj} is a collection of r initially unknown smooth functions that map from ‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚Ñù, and r is a hyperparameter. Good values for r can be determined through cross-validation or a forward stage- wise strategy which stops when the model fit cannot be significantly improved. As r approaches infinity and with an appropriate set of functions {fj}, the PPR model is a universal estimator, as it can approximate any continuous function in ‚Ñùp.  Model estimation  For a given set of data \\\\\\\\{(y_i ,x_i )\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^{n}, the goal is to minimize the error function :\\\\min_{f_j, \\\\beta_j} S=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\left[ y_i - \\\\sum_{j=1}^r f_j (\\\\beta_j^{\\\\mathrm{T}} x_i) \\\\right]^2 over the functions f_j and vectors \\\\beta_j. No method exists for solving over all variables at once, but it can be solved via alternating optimization. First, consider each (f_j, \\\\beta_j) pair individually: Let all other parameters be fixed, and find a \\"residual\\", the variance of the output not accounted for by those other parameters, given by :r_i = y_i - \\\\sum_{l e j} f_l (\\\\beta_l^{\\\\mathrm{T}} x_i) The task of minimizing the error function now reduces to solving :\\\\min_{f_j, \\\\beta_j} S'=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\left[ r_i - f_j(\\\\beta_j^{\\\\mathrm{T}} x_i) \\\\right]^2 for each j in turn. Typically new (f_j, \\\\beta_j) pairs are added to the model in a forward stage-wise fashion. > Aside: Previously-fitted pairs can be readjusted after new fit-pairs are > determined by an algorithm known as backfitting, which entails reconsidering > a previous pair, recalculating the residual given how other pairs have > changed, refitting to account for that new information, and then cycling > through all fit-pairs this way until parameters converge. This process > typically results in a model that performs better with fewer fit-pairs, > though it takes longer to train, and it is usually possible to achieve the > same performance by skipping backfitting and simply adding more fits to the > model (increasing r). Solving the simplified error function to determine an (f_j, \\\\beta_j) pair can be done with alternating optimization, where first a random \\\\beta_j is used to project X in to 1D space, and then the optimal f_j is found to describe the relationship between that projection and the residuals via your favorite scatter plot regression method. Then if f_j is held constant, assuming f_j is once differentiable, the optimal updated weights \\\\beta_j can be found via the Gauss-Newton method--a quasi-Newton method in which the part of the Hessian involving the second derivative is discarded. To derive this, first Taylor expand f_j(\\\\beta_j^{T}x_i) \\\\approx f_j(\\\\beta_{j,old}^{T}x_i) + \\\\dot{f_j}(\\\\beta_{j,old}^{T}x_i)(\\\\beta_j^{T}x_i - \\\\beta_{j,old}^{T}x_i), then plug the expansion back in to the simplified error function S' and do some algebraic manipulation to put it in the form : \\\\min_{\\\\beta_j} S' \\\\approx \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\underbrace{\\\\dot{f_j}(\\\\beta_{j,old}^{T}x_i)^2}_w \\\\Bigg[\\\\bigg(\\\\underbrace{\\\\beta_{j,old}^{T}x_i + \\\\frac{r_i - f_j(\\\\beta_{j,old}^{T}x_i)}{\\\\dot{f_j}(\\\\beta_{j,old}^{T}x_i)}}_{\\\\hat{b}}\\\\bigg) - \\\\beta_j^{T}x_i \\\\Bigg]^2 This is a weighted least squares problem. If we solve for all weights w and put them in a diagonal matrix W, stack all the new targets \\\\hat{b} in to a vector, and use the full data matrix X instead of a single example x_i, then the optimal \\\\beta_j is given by the closed-form :\\\\underset{\\\\beta_j}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,min}} \\\\Big\\\\\\\\vec{\\\\hat{b}} - X\\\\beta_j \\\\Big\\\\_{W}^2 = (X^{\\\\mathrm{T}} WX)^{-1} X^{\\\\mathrm{T}} W \\\\vec{\\\\hat{b}} Use this updated \\\\beta_j to find a new projection of X and refit f_j to the new scatter plot. Then use that new f_j to update \\\\beta_j by resolving the above, and continue this alternating process until (f_j, \\\\beta_j) converges. It has been shown that the convergence rate, the bias and the variance are affected by the estimation of \\\\beta_j and f_j.  Discussion  The PPR model takes the form of a basic additive model but with the additional \\\\beta_j component, so each f_j fits a scatter plot of \\\\beta_j^{T}X^T vs the _residual_ (unexplained variance) during training rather than using the raw inputs themselves. This constrains the problem of finding each f_j to low dimension, making it solvable with common least squares or spline fitting methods and sidestepping the curse of dimensionality during training. Because f_j is taken of a projection of X, the result looks like a \\"ridge\\" orthogonal to the projection dimension, so \\\\\\\\{f_j\\\\\\\\} are often called \\"ridge functions\\". The directions \\\\beta_j are chosen to optimize the fit of their corresponding ridge functions. Note that because PPR attempts to fit projections of the data, it can be difficult to interpret the fitted model as a whole, because each input variable has been accounted for in a complex and multifaceted way. This can make the model more useful for prediction than for understanding the data, though visualizing individual ridge functions and considering which projections the model is discovering can yield some insight.  Advantages of PPR estimation  *It uses univariate regression functions instead of their multivariate form, thus effectively dealing with the curse of dimensionality *Univariate regression allows for simple and efficient estimation *Relative to generalized additive models, PPR can estimate a much richer class of functions *Unlike local averaging methods (such as k-nearest neighbors), PPR can ignore variables with low explanatory power.  Disadvantages of PPR estimation  *PPR requires examining an M-dimensional parameter space in order to estimate \\\\beta_j. *One must select the smoothing parameter for f_j. *The model is often difficult to interpret  Extensions of PPR  *Alternate smoothers, such as the radial function, harmonic function and additive function, have been suggested and their performances vary depending on the data sets used. *Alternate optimization criteria have been used as well, such as standard absolute deviations and mean absolute deviations. *Ordinary least squares can be used to simplify calculations as often the data does not have strong non- linearities. *Sliced Inverse Regression (SIR) has been used to choose the direction vectors for PPR. *Generalized PPR combines regular PPR with iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) and a link function to estimate binary data.  PPR vs neural networks (NN)  Both projection pursuit regression and neural networks models project the input vector onto a one- dimensional hyperplane and then applies a nonlinear transformation of the input variables that are then added in a linear fashion. Thus both follow the same steps to overcome the curse of dimensionality. The main difference is that the functions f_j being fitted in PPR can be different for each combination of input variables and are estimated one at a time and then updated with the weights, whereas in NN these are all specified upfront and estimated simultaneously. Thus, PPR estimation is more straightforward than NN and the transformations of variables in PPR are data driven whereas in NN, these transformations are fixed.

It aired on November 30, 2009. The episode, uniquely centered on Wilson and a day in his life, was notable for departing from the usual House-centric storyline.  Plot  House wakes Wilson from sleep at 6:30 am by playing his guitar and singing \\"Faith\\" by George Michael. House is curious as to why Wilson is not getting ready for work, and Wilson explains that he is not going to work ‚Äì he is taking a day off, and going hunting with a friend. He returns to bed but is followed by House who states that the person Wilson is going hunting with is not a friend but a \\"self-important jerk\\" who does not even know his name (calling him Jim). Wilson ignores him and goes back to sleep. The hunting trip is with Tucker, a former oncology patient, who credits Wilson with saving his life 5 years prior, when close to death from leukemia. Tucker wants to reward \\"Jim\\" in various ways (such as taking him on this hunting trip) for saving his life. They follow a ritual of sticking an empty chemotherapy bag onto a tree, Wilson labeling it with the number of years Tucker has been free of cancer and Tucker shooting the bag. Wilson turns away, using a hunting whistle to try to attract turkeys, suddenly Tucker misfires, narrowly missing Wilson's head. Wilson turns around alarmed, finding Tucker on the ground and complaining he cannot move his arm. Tucker is summarily taken to the hospital for diagnostic tests. Initially, Wilson diagnoses the man with transverse myelitis after noticing that Tucker's girlfriend has a cold sore, the virus of which if transmitted to Tucker could be the cause of his sudden onset paralysis. He prescribes Acyclovir, feeling proud of his 'House-like' diagnostic coup. House, however, bets Wilson $100 that it's actually a recurrence of his cancer, which Wilson refuses to believe. Tucker is discovered to have acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a different form of leukemia than the one he was treated for five years ago (the chemo treatment of which possibly caused/complicated this new recurrence). The cancer seems very treatable, but Tucker does not initially respond to treatment. During the treatment process, regardless of House's warning Wilson decides to employ a double dose of chemotherapy, which does cure the cancer but leads to severe liver damage. Wilson is horrified to realise that without a transplant, Tucker has about twenty-four hours to live. House informs Wilson of a motorcycle accident victim recently admitted who might be a potential donor, but his sister, an Asian woman who appears to be a member of Mahikari, is unwilling to allow the organ donation. They visit her home and attempt to convince her, but she objects, not wanting to violate her brother's remains before burial. House then suggests an alternative scenario: according to some definition, if her brother was not truly dead yet ‚Äì to donate his liver would be a last generous act of a living man rather than a violation of his body. The sister replies that if that were the case, it would be different as she would not be defiling a dead body. So, still not persuaded, Wilson's soon alerted that it's too late anyway as the liver has already degraded beyond usefulness. Angrily, House rebukes the woman as he's leaving, declaring this yet another patient being killed due to 'religion'. Remembering Wilson had donated blood to him before, Tucker realizes his friend would be a compatible donor and impinges on their friendship by pleading for Wilson to donate a portion of his own liver to save his life. Wilson realizes that to do so would be professionally derelict, placing him in an ethical quandary wherein he'd feel he's crossed a line, thereafter obliged to donate tissue to any needy patient. Nevertheless, he considers complying due to a sense of guilt over prescribing the double dose of chemotherapy that destroyed his liver, therefore responsible for the cause of death. House finds this moral dilemma quite asinine, given that Wilson is blaming himself for treating his patient's cancer. After seeing how Tucker had reunited with his estranged family in light of his dire situation and wishing to extend this precious time for him, Wilson finally relents to his friend's plea and plans to go ahead with the operation to donate a portion of his liver. Before the operation, Wilson asks House to be there for the operation. House, showcasing a rare moment of vulnerability, initially refuses by revealing to Wilson that he can't, because \\"If you die, I'm alone.\\" At the operation, as Wilson is being anesthetized, he sees House enter the viewing area above and smiles just as the anesthetic fully kicks in. After the operation however, Tucker reverts to his selfish old ways, and tells Wilson: \\"The person you want when you're dying isn't the same person you want when you're living.\\" Now that he's going to live, he reveals he's summarily casting his family aside again to again pursue a new love interest, one even younger (almost the same age as his own daughter). Wilson contains his reaction, but it's clear that his view of Tucker has now aligned closer to that of House's, who's always disliked him. Meanwhile, the relationship between Cuddy and Lucas continues, shown from Wilson's point of view. Cuddy wants to buy a new home through Wilson's realtor ex-wife, Bonnie, and is seeking House's approval, also indirectly through Wilson. Complaining she has hurt him, House schemes and plots to interfere with this latest relationship development, again through Wilson. Later, Wilson takes House to the fancy new loft apartment that Cuddy had wanted, and tells House he has bought it instead (Bonnie disclosed Cuddy's bid so he was able to outbid her, practically 'stealing' it from under her). He explains that he did so because she had hurt his friend (House) so \\"deserved to be punished\\"; besides, the two of them needed a bigger place to live in, \\"with space for a larger refrigerator!\\" (in effect, an apology for the angry eviction of before.)  Music  *\\"Faith\\" (by George Michael) performed by Hugh Laurie *\\"A Slow Parade\\" by A.A. Bondy  Critical response  Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club rated the episode A-, saying he really enjoyed the episode and was excited not because of big moments or shocking revelation but rather because of how well the friendship of House and Wilson was played.  Popular culture references  At the very end of the episode, Wilson comes to House's office and announces that he plans to give Tucker part of his liver. During the course of their conversation Wilson says \\"I am not here for an argument, House\\", to which House replies \\"No, right, that's room 12A\\", in reference to the \\"Argument Clinic\\" sketch from Monty Python's Flying Circus.

G. Wells. The book is a compilation of 26 articles and a lecture published in the United Kingdom and the United States throughout 1927. The topics range from politics to science and from social affairs to economics. Originally published in the Sunday Express in the UK, and the New York Times in the US, the articles provided Wells with the best medium to air his social and political agendas. In his opening notes to the book Wells expressed his frustration at the ‚Äúeditorial interference‚Äù that resulted in his work appearing only after, ‚Äúsuffering a certain amount of mutilation.‚Äù Wells, H.G, The Way the World is Going, Ernest Benn Limited, Page v. Although this introduction appeared in both the UK and US editions, Wells subsequently had to clarify that his complaints applied to the Sunday Express only, and not the New York Times, which published the articles essentially intact. The articles are a mixture of predictions and commentary based on the science and politics of the time. The book is similar to Wells' earlier 1925 work A Year of Prophesying. Unlike this earlier work, The Way the World is Going is marked by both a dark disillusionment and decaying optimism over the state of the world at the time.

From 1944 to 1946 he was the president of the American Psychiatric Association.Basic biographical details obtained from Dr. Bowman's obituary, \\"Karl M. Bowman, Psychiatrist, 84,\\" New York Times, March 4, 1973. His work in alcoholism, schizophrenia, and homosexuality is particularly often cited. Family and education Bowman was born in Topeka, Kansas, and graduated from Washburn University. His nickname in college was \\"Tommy,\\" according to the school's 1910 yearbook. While at Washburn, he was a member and president of the Delta Phi Fraternity, forerunner of the Kansas Beta chapter of Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. Bowman was initiated into Phi Delta Theta with the chapter‚Äôs founding fathers on October 1, 1910.See the history of Phi Delta Theta at Washburn University at http://phidelt.wikispaces.com/kansas+beta In 1913, he graduated from medical school at the University of California, Berkeley with his M.D. Bowman was married to the former Eliza Abbot Stearns. Together they had four sons, Dr. Walter M. Bowman, Dr. Thomas E. Bowman, Dr. Murdock S. Bowman, and Professor Richard S. Bowman, and 13 grandchildren. During World War I, Bowman was a captain in the Army Medical Corps from 1917 to 1919. Psychiatric work In the course of his career, Bowman conducted pioneering work on the psychiatric effects of alcohol, drugs, and sexuality. He also conducted research on schizophrenia and the use of insulin shock therapy. He testified at the trials of Nathan F. Leopold and Richard Loeb for the murder of Robert Franks in 1924 as well as in many other celebrated cases. During his career, Bowman was the chief medical officer at the Boston Psychopathic Hospital; an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School (1921‚Äì1936); the chief of psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital (1936‚Äì1941); a professor of psychiatry at New York University Medical College (1936‚Äì1941); the first chairman and director of the Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute (1941‚Äì1956); and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He was also the head of the Laguna Honda Psychiatric Hospital in San Francisco (1941‚Äì1967) As the retiring president of the American Psychiatric Association in 1946, he made headlines when he predicted that 10 million people in the United States would at some time in their lives require hospitalization for mental disorders. Bowman was also a board member of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. Alcoholism Bowman was Head of the Department of Psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital in New York City when Dr. Allen Gregg (Director of the Rockefeller Foundation) asked him to participate in an alcoholism study he had been preparing. Bowman was interested in this project but wished to have a part in leading the study. In 1938, Bowman joined the Moore Group. This group founded the \\"Research Council on Problems of Alcohol\\" or the RCPA, which was an organization similar to Alcoholics Anonymous. Soon after it was created, Bowman became a leader of this organization.Ron Roizen, \\"E.M. Jellinek and All That!: A Brief Look Back at the Origins of Post-Repeal Alcohol Science in the United States,\\" H. Thomas Austern Lecture, Alcoholic Beverage Medical Research Foundation, San Francisco, October 20-26, 2000. With E. Morton Jellinek, he co-wrote an influential 1941 article, \\"Alcohol Addiction and Its Treatment,\\" synthesizing prior typologies of alcoholism and classifying alcoholics into four types, which was the basis of Jellinek's later five-stage typology. He also researched and wrote on marijuana. Schizophrenia Karl Bowman read his article \\"The Modern Treatment of Schizophrenia\\" at the New York Academy of Medicine in New York on February 17, 1939. During his reading, Bowman stated, \\"over one half of the population of State Hospitals\\" consisted of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. He claimed that this psychological disorder did not shorten the lifespan of the patient, but resulted in the deterioration of the patient's brain. In his article, Bowman addresses many different methods that were used throughout history to help treat schizophrenia. For example, fever therapy consisted of inducing a fever in the patient using various methods, such as the malaria virus, but did not produce effective results in the treatment of schizophrenia. Sleep therapy was carried out using sleep- inducing substances such as marijuana, opium, and somnifen. Bowman also addresses stimulus therapy; this method had only temporary effects. Bowman recommended the insulin method as effective, with longer-lasting effects and more indications of long-term improvement. Bowman was optimistic about schizophrenia patients whose conditions had improved or had been cured and also about future treatment methods for schizophrenia patients. Homosexuality During the 1950s and 1960s, Bowman collaborated in a number of studies on homosexuality and wrote a report on it for the State of California. In 1953, in \\"The Problem of Homosexuality,\\" co-authored with Bernice Engle, he argued for multiple causes, including genetics, but proposed that castration be studied as a cure. However, in 1961 he appeared in the television documentary The Rejected presenting the viewpoint that homosexuality is not a mental illness and should be legalized.

This timeline lists important events relevant to the life of the Italian diplomat, writer and political philosopher Niccol√≤ di Bernardo dei Machiavelli (1469‚Äì1527). Machiavelli was born in Florence in 1469 of an old citizen family. Little is known about his life until 1498, when he was appointed secretary and second chancellor to the Florentine Republic. During his time of office his journeys included missions to Louis XII of France and to the Holy Roman Emperor Maximillian I; he was with Cesare Borgia in the Romagna; and after watching the second Papal election of 1503 he accompanied Pope Julius II on his first campaign of conquest. In 1507, as chancellor of the newly appointed Nove di Milizia (Nine of the Militia), he organised an infantry force which fought at the capture of Pisa in 1509. Three years later it was defeated by the Holy League at Prato, the Medici returned to Florence, and Machiavelli was excluded from public life. After suffering imprisonment and torture, he retired to his farm near San Casciano, where he lived with his wife and six children and gave his time to study and writing. His works included The Prince; the Discourses on the First Decade of Livy; The Art of War and the comedy, Mandragola, a satire on seduction. In 1520, Cardinal Giulio de' Medici (later Pope Clement VII, 1523) secured him a commission to write a history of Florence, which he finished in 1525. After a brief return to public life, he died in 1527.Grafton 2003, p. i.

Two French-Canadians - Michel Clair (a former Cabinet Minister in the Parti Qu√©becois) and R√©jean Roy (a reporter for Radio-Canada) worked together with T≈ëk√©s' brother - Istv√°n - who was living in Montreal to help set up the trip. The mission succeeded, and the tapes of the interview got out to the West with the aid of underground couriers just before Clair and Roy were arrested by the Romanian secret police (Securitate). The two Canadians were eventually released. That interview was then first broadcast on July 24, 1989, on the \\"Panor√°ma\\" TV show on Hungarian State TV (MTV) which could also be seen in western Romania. In the interview L√°szl√≥ T≈ëk√©s, a member of Romania's large Hungarian minority, criticized the harsh living conditions in the country and the discriminatory policies against national minorities pursued by Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceau≈üescu. Because of the interview T≈ëk√©s was fired and after several court challenges was given the final deadline of Friday, December 15, 1989 to leave his church. On the previous Sunday - Sunday, December 10 - T≈ëk√©s told his parishioners to come out on the Friday to bear witness as to what will happen. Instead, first dozens, then hundreds and eventually thousands of people came out and surroundeded his church to protect T≈ëk√©s from advancing Securitate and military. By the evening of December 16 fighting broke out outside T≈ëk√©s' church that then spread across the city and then across the country. The film reveals how the Securitate was initially outfoxed, uncovers information from Securitate archives in Bucharest about attempts by Ceausescu to silence T≈ëk√©s, and talks about informers working for the Securitate. It also has an extensive interview with former Securitate Major Radu Tinu who was responsible for T≈ëk√©s. Today L√°szl√≥ T≈ëk√©s is a member of the European Parliament. The world premiere of the cinema version of the film will be in Timi»ôoara on December 15, 2009, on the 20th anniversary of the Romanian Revolution. Hungary's DUNA- TV will also broadcast a 52-minute version on December 15.

Shimron was the name of a major city in the north of Israel in early antiquity. It is mentioned in the Bible by this name, and in other period sources as Shim'on. In late antiquity, it was known by the name Simonias ().Josephus (Vita ¬ß 24); Jerusalem Talmud, Megillah 1:1 (2b); Midrash Rabba (Genesis Rabba 81:2) The city is identified with the tell called Tell Samunia in Arabic, also written Samunieh.Benjamin Maisler (Mazar), Qovetz: Journal of the Jewish Palestinian Exploration Society, 2nd year, volumes 1‚Äì4, article: Shimron ‚Äì Simoniah, Jerusalem 1934‚Äì1935, pp. 1‚Äì7 (Hebrew). The tell rises 60 meters above its surroundings, north-east of moshav Nahalal, on the border between the Lower Galilee, and the Jezreel Valley. Today the tell is not settled, Timrat was established alongside, to the east. History Bronze Age to Middle Ages Shimron was one of the Bronze Age fortified Canaanite cities that controlled the Jezreel Valley, possibly the largest of them. All of these cities were located at an entrance to the valley, and controlled one of the roads leading into it. In the Amarna letters and the Execration texts, the city is referred to as Shim'on. It is also mentioned as one of the cities that were attacked by Joshua (), and also as belonging to the Tribe of Zebulun (). In the Hellenistic period, there was a large settlement at the foot of the tell, called Shimonia or Samunia. The city was central during First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War, and in 66 CE a battle occurred here between the Jewish rebels and the Romans, who besieged the city. Josephus, mentioning the village by name, states that he was attacked there at night by the Roman decurion, √Übutius, who had been entrusted with the charge of the Great Plain and who had one-hundred horse and two-hundred infantry at his disposal. The Roman soldiers, however, were forced to withdraw since their horses were of little use in that terrain (Life of Flavius Josephus, ¬ß 24). The name of the city occurs also elsewhere, in the Babylonian Talmud (Niddah 24b), and in the Middle Ages it is mentioned by Ishtori Haparchi (\\"Kaftor wa-Fera·∏•\\", ch. xi, written in 1322). Artificial mounds, traces of ruins, and a sarcophagus have been found here.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 339 Ottoman era A map from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 by Pierre Jacotin showed a village here, named Sammouni.Karmon, 1960, p. 163. In 1838, Edward Robinson found here a small Arab village called Semunieh,Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, p. 201Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 132 and he noted it again in 1852.Robinson and Smith, 1856, p. 320 In 1867, a group of German Templers attempted to establish a settlement on the site, which failed due to malaria.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 355 In 1875, Victor Gu√©rin visited the place and noted: \\"The present village has succeeded a small ancient city, now completely destroyed. East of the site which it occupied rises a round isolated hill, which commands the plain in every direction, and was once surrounded on its summit by a wall, of which a few traces still remain. This hill must probably have been fortified. Scarped towards the east, it slopes gently on the western side towards the town, which covered the lower hillocks at its feet. Among them I found, in the midst of the various debris which cover the soil, the remains of a building in cut stone, completely overthrown, once ornamented by columns, as is attested by two mutilated shafts lying on the spot. This edifice seems to have been constructed from east to west, so that it may have been a Christian church. \\"In another place I saw an enclosure measuring thirty-five paces in length by twenty-five in breadth. From a distance it appears ancient. It is, however, of modern date, constructed of stones of all sizes and shapes ; among them pillars of broken sarcophagi\\".Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 384-386; as given in Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 339 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described it as a small village on a knoll with three springs, having probably less than 100 inhabitants.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 280 A population list from about 1887 showed that Semunieh had about 100 inhabitants; all Muslims.Schumacher, 1888, p. 183 Gottlieb Schumacher, as part of surveying for the construction of the Jezreel Valley railway, noted in 1900 that the village \\"had not increased [since the 1881 SWP survey] due to its unhealthy position and bad water. The proprietor, Sursock, built a number of dwellings covered with tile masonry.\\"Schumacher, 1900, p. 358 British Mandate era In 1936, the site became an agricultural training station for the Moshavim Movement. One group that trained here came from Nahalal, and continued on to establish kibbutz Hanita. In 1948, kibbutz Timorim was established on the site. Timorim became a moshav shitufi in 1953 and moved to the south of the country, due to lack of farming lands. When it was vacated, it became a Ma'abara (transit camp) for new immigrants destined for Migdal Ha'Emek and Ramat Yishai. Nature reserve In 1965, a 28-dunam nature reserve was declared, preserving the Apple-ring Acacia (syn. Acacia albida) trees that grow on the site. This is the northernmost occurrence of these trees in Israel. The Apple-ring Acacia, native to Africa and the Middle East, is used for nitrogen fixation, erosion control for crops, for food, drink and medicine. It sheds its leaves in the rainy season and is highly valued in agroforestry as it can grow among field crops without shading them.ILDIS LegumeWeb Archaeology In the years spanning 2004, 2008 and 2010, archaeological excavations were conducted at Tel Shimron by Nurit Feig and Alexander Yarde on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA).Israel Antiquities Authority, Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2004, Survey Permit # A-4284; Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2008, Survey Permit # A-5334; Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2010, Survey Permit # A-6060.

Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Bernal, a member of the 1776 De Anza Expedition, was a soldier at the Presidio of San Francisco and the Pueblo of San Jos√©, and grantee of Rancho Santa Teresa. Antonio Maria Pico (1809‚Äì1869), son of Jos√© Dolores Pico, was the grantee of Rancho Pescadero and married Maria del Pilar Bernal (1812‚Äì1882) in 1831. Pico sold his one fourth share of Rancho El Valle de San Jos√© to Juan Pablo Bernal. The Bernals only moved to the rancho after the gold rush to protect their interests from squatters. Agust√≠n Bernal moved to his portion of the Rancho and built an adobe in 1850.Victoria Christian, 2007, Sunol, Arcadia Publishing, Mar√≠a Dolores Bernal married Antonio Marie Su√±ol (1796‚Äì1865), born in Spain, a seaman on a French merchant ship and arrived in the Pueblo of San Jos√© in 1818. He held several public offices including Postmaster (1826‚Äì1829), and Alcalde (mayor) in 1841. In 1847 he bought Rancho Los Coches from a mission Indian grantee. Sunol, California is named for him. Su√±ol lived in San Jos√©, and his son, (also with the name Antonio Maria Su√±ol), moved to the rancho in the 1840s. There he built an adobe just west of the present Sunol Water Temple. Su√±ol lived there until his death at the hands of a squatter in 1855. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Valle de San Jos√© was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852,United States. District Court (California : Northern District) Land Case 102 ND and the grant was patented to Antonio Su√±ol in 1865. Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886 John W.

It is affiliated with the National Speleological Society. OHDG is involved with caving and conservation efforts in central Oregon and beyond, including the Oregon Caves National Monument, the Lava Beds National Monument in northern California, and caves in western Idaho and southern Washington. Members of the Grotto have worked with the Department of State Lands and received a participation award from state leaders for their volunteer work. In 2013, the Grotto was recognized by Region 6 of the United States Forest Service for various volunteer hours working with caves and bats. They received the R6 Volunteers and Service and Program Award.  History  The Oregon High Desert Grotto was first created in 1989 by Dan Best. It lasted only a year before complications terminated the Grotto. In late 1995, the OHDG was reformed by the new founding member Ric Carlson, who was at the time an employee of the forest service. By 1997, the Grotto had over 30 members, a newsletter publication, and a growing knowledge of caves in the Central Oregon area and beyond. As of 2012, the OHDG continues to find new caves. Grotto member Matt Skeels has found over 100 new caves. Today, the Grotto is actively involved with caving in most of Oregon and the adjacent states.  Exploration  Members of the Oregon High Desert Grotto understand that caves are a fragile resource. They are dedicated to preserving these special underground spaces. Each year, the group organizes a number exploration trips, study efforts, and preservation projects. The group‚Äôs exploration work includes caving adventures, cave surveys, and photographic documentation of cave resources.Matt Skeels, Matt, \\"The Caves of Central Oregon\\", Oregon High Desert Grotto, Bend, Oregon, 5 October 2013. While members of the Oregon High Desert Grotto have explored caves all over the western United States, the group‚Äôs focus is on Central Oregon. Most of the known caves in Central Oregon are in Deschutes County, the groups home area. The Oregon High Desert Grotto has identified 690 caves in Deschutes County, 577 of these are lava tubes. Of the remaining caves the majority are also lava related formations including vertical conduits, fissures, bubbles, and lava molds. Of the 690 caves, there are only 42 that were not created by lava flows. Many of these are rift or fissure caves, some up to deep. There are also a number of rock shelters, large rock overhangs created by water or wind erosion. These caves occur throughout Central Oregon, usually in rim rock areas. Finally, there are a few talus caves. Talus caves are found in cracks and open spaces between boulders along faults and in rock fall area. Some Central Oregon caves are easy to explore, especially the larger lava tubes. However, other caves require significant planning in order to be explored safely. Many require a strenuous hike just to get to the cave; and while underground, dark spaces and tight passages can be dangerous for anyone who is not prepared. As a result, members of the Oregon High Desert Grotto are careful to bring along the proper equipment for each caving trip. Explorers always wear helmets to protect our heads. Each person brings three sources of light, and members never go caving alone.\\"Cave Access\\", Oregon High Desert Grotto, Bend, Oregon, 5 October 2013. Members of the Oregon High Desert Grotto are always careful to protect wildlife. During the winter, grotto members avoid caves with hibernating bats. Waking a bat from hibernation is extremely stressful, and may cause the bat to expend its fat reserves prematurely which can lead to death later that winter or early spring. The group also avoids caves with bat maternity colonies during the summer months.\\"Bats\\", Living with Wildlife, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Salem, Oregon, December 2000. Over the last few years, the Grotto has been involved in the study and mapping of the Sandy Glacier Caves on Mount Hood in Oregon. Their efforts were recorded by Oregon Field Guide in 2013, and aired on OPB in October of that year. Partnership Award 2008 given to the Oregon High Desert Grotto for their work at the Stevens Land Tract in Bend, Oregon. Art by Linda Pitt.  Conservation  The OHDG is an avid participant in conserving and restoring caves since many of the caves have been damaged from increased recreational activities, including rock climbing. The Grotto often partners with the United States Forest Service (USFS) to help manage the caves of the Deschutes National Forest. Cooperation with private owners of caves has also been done. On National Public Lands Day in September 2000, the Grotto participated in the gating of Stookey Ranch Cave. Cleanup trips to caves in the area are common and are synonymous with the caving motto: \\"Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints, kill nothing but time.\\" In late 2010, Missing lavacicles from Lavacicle Cave were reacquired by Grotto member Eddy Cartaya while working for the USFS. The lavacicles will be used as educational tools at Lava Lands Visitor Center. The Grotto is involved with caving and conservation efforts beyond its local area of central Oregon. Grotto member Brent McGregor produced a video for the Oregon Caves National Monument promoting safe caving to conserve the off-trail parts of the cave. Other efforts have been done with Lava Beds National Monument in northern California, western Idaho, and Nevada. Ken Siegrist, of the Grotto and former employee of the Bureau of Land Management, has worked to protect many caves, including those of eastern and southern Oregon. Members of the Grotto have also worked in conjunction with the Department of State Lands and received a participation award from State leaders for their volunteer work with the state. Additionally, the Grotto along with land management agencies, has helped collect and discover millipedes, campodeans, arachnid, and harvestman invertebrates, including some new to science. Neil Marchington has helped discover the Trogloraptor marchingtoni of southwest Oregon.

Robert Allen Boyer, your average ‚ÄúB‚Äù chemistry student was given an extraordinary opportunity that changed his future and the future of automobile production in the U.S. (Plastic) Boyer, born on 30 September 1909 in Toledo, Ohio was given this chance when Ford hired his father to run the nation's oldest hotel, the Wayside Inn, in South Sudbury, Massachusetts. Ford frequented the inn and that is where Boyer was discovered. Ford claimed that Boyer had a ‚Äúkeen active mind‚Äù. He asked Boyer to enroll in the new Henry Ford Trade School and participate in its unique work-study program instead of following his plans to enter Andover prep school and then Dartmouth College (Shurtleff). Boyer excelled in the Ford Trade School and took to exploring concepts such as how to manufacture synthetic wool from soybeans. These were the types of problems that stumped the experts (Plastic). Boyer graduated the Ford Trade School at the age of 21 with a promising chemistry career in front of him. He started this career as the head of the soybean lab at the Edison Institute (Shurtleff). Here Boyer‚Äôs career took off. He started working to use soybeans in ways they had never been used before. Boyer has done things from extracting lubricating and paint oils from the soybean to creating a synthetic wool made from soybeans and pressing insulating varnish for starters and generators (Plastic). One of Boyer‚Äôs first projects began in 1932 and included building ‚Äúa small solvent extractor to separate the bean into soy oil and protein-rich meal‚Äù (Shurtleff). The soybean oil became the most crucial commercial soy products on Ford cars. In 1934 the five to eight coats of lacquer that cars previously had been finished with was replaced with a synthetic baked enamel paint which contained about 35% soy oil. This new synthetic paint with soy oil saved considerable time and money. In 1937, Boyer developed a curved plastic sheet which he hoped would replace steel in the auto bodies of ford cars. He was so confident in his product that he took an axe to it in the middle of a crowd of reporters and critics. He also jumped up and down on the curved sheet. When there was no bending in the sheet and no shattering due to the axe and the weight of him jumping on the sheet, people were astounded (shurtleff). This soy protein plastic sheet consist of 70% cellulose and 30% resin binder pressed into cloth. ‚ÄúThe new rust-free, dent-proof plastic was reportedly 50% lighter and 50% cheaper to produce than steel‚Äù (Shurtleff). This new plastic body cut the total weight of the car from 3,000 lb. to 2,000 (Dearborn). The sheets look like polished steel and can be bent but just snap back into place, therefore when caught in fender benders, the fender would bounce back like ‚Äúrubber balls‚Äù (Shurtleff). Needless to say, this product was a breakthrough in the world of automobile production. Boyer also used the soy isolates to produce the world's first plant protein fiber in 1938. (Shurtleff.) This fiber resembled a soft wool, it was tan in color, had a medium luster and a soft warm feel. ‚Äúit has 80% the strength of wool, took the same dyes, had good elongation, and did not wet as easily as wool.‚Äù(Shurtleff). Boyer figured this fiber could be used for upholstery in cars, filling in felt hats, or for clothing. Boyer changed the way the soybean was used and created innovative products we use daily.

Background Hamlet of Henfield - a former colliery settlement. Henfield is a small hamlet that has seen considerable land use change over the recent centuries moving from a traditional agricultural landscape to an active coal mining area by the beginning of the nineteenth century. The noise and pollution associated with mining and railway operations would have been constant. Population would have increased at that time supported by the introduction of new miner's cottages by the Coalpit Heath Colliery Company. The closure of New Engine Pit, the remaining mine, before the end of the nineteenth century represented change but with railway sidings and engine shed at New Engine and the movement of labour to the nearby Parkfield and Frog Lane Pits, the industrial nature of the area was maintained to well into the twentieth century. Bitterwell Close - a former railway siding The closure of the Frog Lane Pit at Coalpit Heath in 1949 represented a step change in the area and Henfield reverted to its agricultural roots, a quiet clustered hamlet surrounded by pastoral agricultural land. There were new additions at that time with the introduction of Henfield Village Hall and a little ribbon development along the convergent minor roads. The area was peaceful in the 1950s and early 1960s with little in the way of noise and light pollution. The construction of the M4 Motorway to the south of the hamlet in the late 1960s began to change the character of the area and with the expansion of Bristol and Yate, Henfield has lost its tranquillity and adopted a new role as a commuter satellite to the main urban areas. At the same time the character of the landscape has changed with dairy farming being replaced by new uses in particular \\"horsiculture\\" and the manicured landscape of the Kendleshire Golf Course. However, with a rich heritage and reminders of its links with the past, such as Bitterwell Lake, the hamlet retains an important sense of community. Industrial Archaeology Coal Mines Henfield is situated near the centre of the North Bristol Coal Field, this area at one time having been a prolific coal mining community. Coal had been mined in this area since the fourteenth century and most likely even earlier. However it was Sir Samuel Astry, Lord of the Manor of Westerleigh c1680 who started mining on a grander scale and his descendants, or their business partners, continued to be connected with the Coalpit Heath Colliery Company. Within Henfield itself there were 4 mines operational in the early nineteenth century: A relic from the hamlet's industrial past between the two dwellings. * Serridge Engine Pit - was sunk in 1785 and located near to Serridge House. This mine was linked by an early tramway to the old Ram Hill pit. * Orchard (or Middle Wimsey) Pit - was opened in the late eighteenth century and was active at the time the Dramway was completed in 1832 but was superseded by the New Engine Pit soon afterwards. * No. 11 Pit - little is known of this pit other than its location south of the above pits. * New Engine Pit was sunk around 1824 and was the only one of the Henfield pits that was still operational after 1867. It had a depth of 502 ft 10ins which at that time was recorded as the deepest shaft sunk in the trough of Coalpit Heath. In the mid-nineteenth century New Engine Pit was the main pit for the Coalpit Heath group of mines. Most coal for this area was drawn from this pit, the other shafts being kept open for pumping and ventilation. On the New Engine Pit site today there are the remains of a horse gin and an engine house, while the area itself is called New Engine. In 1930 it was recorded that there was an 1832 Acraman steam engine at the New Engine colliery site that was being used to drive a saw mill. However, there is no trace of this engine today. For the nearby Ram Hill Engine Pit, Ram Hill Colliery, Churchleaze No. 1 Pit and Churchleaze No. 2 Pit see Ram Hill. The underground map of around 1850 shows that the underground roads of the nearby Ram Hill Colliery and Churchleaze pits on Ram Hill joined together with those of the Serridge Engine and New Engine pits. Bristol and Gloucestershire Railway Access track to Bitterwell Lake car park was at one time part of the dramway to Ram Hill Colliery.In the Bristol and Gloucestershire Railway Act of 19 June 1828, parliament authorised the construction of a horse-drawn railway from Ram Hill to the River Avon in Bristol. It was completed and in use by July 1832. At the same time the Avon and Gloucestershire Railway constructed a connecting line from near Mangotsfield to the River Avon at Keynsham. The Ram Hill Colliery was the northern terminus and near of Bitterwell Lake (then known as Bitterwell Pond, a colliery drainage sump, there was also a southern spur to New Engine Pit; technical facilities were provided there and it served as a supply depot to other local pits. When New Engine Pit ceased extraction itself, the support facilities continued in use, and it came to be named New Engine Yard. These early railways provided cheap and easy transport from the mines of Coalpit Heath to the wharves on the Avon at Keynsham and Bristol. They were built as single track railway, built to the gauge of 4 ft 8 in gauge, with passing places along the route. The whole length of the railway was built on a down hill gradient dropping 225 ft along the route.Colin G Maggs, The Bristol and Gloucester Railway and the Avon and Gloucestershire Railway, second edition 1992, Oakwood Press, Headington, Peter Lawson, Walking the Dramway, Tempus Publishing Ltd, Stroud, 2006, South Gloucestershire Mines Research Group, Kingswood Coal, 2009, The railways were colloquially referred to as the dramway and in recent times this has been formalised by usage on signs indicating the footpath facilities, and on Ordnance Survey mapping. Disused railway line near Bitterwell Lake - now heavily overgrown. In 1839 a main line railway, the Bristol and Gloucester Railway obtained its Act of Parliament; this authorised it to take over the Bristol and Gloucestershire line, and to make a main line railway to Gloucester. The railway was to be on the broad gauge (7 ft 0¬º in, 2,140 mm) and this required the colliery lines to be converted too. It opened on 5 June 1844. The Coalpit Heath group of pits had by then declined, and the line to them beyond New Engine Yard was not converted. In around 1860 a northern branch was constructed near Boxhedge Farm that served the new Frog Lane Colliery at Coalpit Heath. Following the closure of the New Engine Pit towards the end of the nineteenth century, railway infrastructure at Henfield remained in the form of railway sidings and engine shed. These served the Frog Lane Colliery until its closure in 1949. Some dilapidated built remnants of the railway remain including the old engine shed at New Engine Yard and weighbridge house near Boxhedge Farm. Community Facilities Bitterwell Lake Fishing at Bitterwell Lake Bitterwell Lake, also referred to as Bitterwell Pond, is situated near the junction of roads leading to Coalpit Heath and Ram Hill. This man-made lake is used as a fishing lake and is owned by Westerleigh Parish Council, and used for bathing, fishing, model yachting and boat hire. It was acquired by the Parish Council in 1930, once owned by the Coalpit Heath Colliery Company.The company used it to soak the pit props for the mine. The lake is over 3 acres in extent and at the time of purchase was surrounded by numerous stone and tiled buildings and two detached cottages with gardens. Bitterwell Lake - a community resource It is difficult to establish when precisely the lake was excavated but it was after 1845 as it does not appear on the Westerleigh Tithe Map 1845 and before 1881 as it is clearly shown on the 1st edition (1881) Ordnance Survey Map. There is also uncertainty about the functions of Bitterwell Lake in relation to the mines at Henfield. It may have supplied reservoir water for the mine engines. Sluices regulated water in the lake and within living memory the overflow went to The Clamp, another reservoir pond that had been constructed near the Serridge Pit. In the 1930s Bitterwell Lake received wide coverage in the newspapers that it was the home of Tarzan who lived in a tree-house and climbed like a monkey. An example is provided by The Mercury, in Hobart, Tasmania, that reported on 10 October 1934 that in the woods around Bitterwell Lake, near Bristol, is a man aged 20, who lives in the tree tops wearing only a leopard skin. His name is Bernard Skuse but he is known to his friends as Tarzan. \\"That's my favourite tree\\" he told the \\"Daily Express\\" Bristol correspondent pointing out the tallest of a number of trees clustering round the lake. He was at the top in ten seconds swinging through the branches of adjacent trees to reach it. He lives in an eyrie among the leaves which he built himself. It has a wooden floor and a thatched roof. His explanation of his predilection for this mode of life is: \\"I like it so I do it.\\" He is bronzed with a perfectly proportioned muscular body. He explained that his feet are rather flat, which makes climbing easy. When not at work he hunts with a spear, a knife and a bow and arrow. When he feels hot he dives into the lake.\\" Nowadays Bitterwell Lake is solely used for fishing but at the same time represents an important local amenity for the surrounding area. A record 8.5 lb eel was caught at Bitterewell Lake in 1922. This held the national record for almost half a century. Village Hall Henfield Village Hall Henfield Village Hall - Parish Council records indicate that deeds were received in 1948 for land next to Bitterwell Lake to be used for a new village hall for the residents of the Henfield and New Engine. By the 1960s the village hall represented an important facility in the small community with Saturday dances, whist drives, youth club meetings, jumble sales as well as being a setting for the annual village shows. The Hall has been modernised and is now known as the Henfield Social Club and is available for hire for a range of activities and private functions. Recreation ground and play facilities Newman Field - This small recreation area is located next to the Village Hall and Bitterwell Lake. The land was donated by Jo Newman to the community in 1974. Village Shop The community no longer has a village shop but in the past in the 1960s a small store was run by Mrs Tovey. Governance Henfield sign Play area at Newman Field The two tiers of local government that are responsible for administering Henfield are: * South Gloucestershire Council * Westerleigh Parish Council Westerleigh Parish Council has 9 elected members. Matters that have been under recent consideration at Henfield include: * condition of the Boat Shed at Bitterwell Lake * play area at Newman Field Planning In the adopted South Gloucestershire Local Plan Henfield does not have a Defined Settlement Boundary on the Proposals Map and there are no sites allocated for new residential development. The hamlet is within an area defined as Green Belt and is located within the Forest of Avon area. There are also Major Recreational Routes in the hamlet. Environment Landscape Fields adjacent to Serridge House Within the South Gloucestershire Landscape Character Assessment SPD the hamlet of Henfield is within an area defined as: Westerleigh Vale and Oldland Ridge - The Study indicates that Ram Hill and Henfield, a colliery settlement, are small dispersed/linear and clustered hamlets respectively, consisting of a mix of, Pennant sandstone with more recent render and brick buildings, focused around a convergence of minor roads and lanes. Around the two settlements are scattered farms. The area of Ram Hill and Henfield comprises a largely strong, irregular rural framework with areas of woodland, mixed overgrown/clipped hedgerows supplemented with wire fences, defining regular shaped fields. The clustered settlement pattern and non-agricultural activities such as storage compounds, are reasonably well integrated as a result of this framework. Horse paddocks are however locally evident where hedgerows have become replaced with fences. Associated ad hoc home-made stables are also evident and atypical of a rural landscape. Large modern agricultural sheds are prominent within older farm complexes within this area. Horsiculture at Henfield The small scale settlement at Ram Hill and Henfield is largely well integrated within the framework of hedgerow trees and woodland. The area has a generally tranquil character, although the presence of stables and fences associated with the increase in land use change to \\"horsiculture\\". modern large farm buildings and storage compounds, can detract from this, visually eroding the rural character and resulting in removal or fragmentation of hedgerows. In places the recreational pressure for \\"horsiculture\\" with the associated infrastructure of stables, access tracks, exercise areas, jumps and floodlighting. can result in a marked change in landscape character. Martin Croft Brake Frome Valley - The Study indicates that the Kendleshire Golf Course retains most of the hedgerows and tree structure amongst fairways and greens. However the Golf Course introduces a different landscape structure compared with the adjacent agricultural landscape. A more open landscape structure of mown fairways, low mounding, remnant hedgerows and hedgerow trees and young planting is evident. The new planting measures will in time provide a new landscape structure and help integrate this land-use change with its surroundings. Biodiversity Two areas of Broadleaved Woodland in Henfield are identified by South Gloucestershire Council as Sites of Nature Conservation Importance: * Martin Croft Brake * Branch Pool Wood There are no Sites of Special Scientific Interest within the hamlet. Sport and Recreation Henfield Youth AFC Former ground of Henfield Youth AFC Henfield Youth AFC was a football club based in the hamlet that was formed in 1960 by a group of local youngsters and their friends. At the outset the club played friendly matches before joining the Bristol Church of England League in 1961. Under the guidance of Percy Bennett (Chairman), Herbert Livall (Secretary) and Alan Parker (Treasurer) the club progressed from Division 4 to Division 1 of the Church of England League before spending their last few seasons in Division 2. A training floodlight - the last remaining relic of Henfield Youth AFC. After initially changing in Henfield Village Hall the club acquired the former Bitterwell Lake Model Yacht Club premises and converted them to changing rooms. The club unfortunately folded in 1972 after losing the use of their ground which was situated on agricultural land adjoining the Village Hall and old Railway Line. The land is now used as horse paddocks and the only reminder of the former football club is an old training floodlight which overlooks the Village Hall car park and the Newman Field amenity area next to Bitterwell Lake that Percy Bennett created so that youngsters could still have an area to play football. For a number of years this area, which was donated to Westerleigh Parish Council by Jo Newman, was used for organised small-sided football matches. Henfield Youth AFC at one time ran two sides and a considerable number of players passed through the club's ranks over the 12-year period. They included: * Gordon Bennett - who was Chief Executive of Bristol Rovers, Norwich City F.C. and Aberdeen F.C. and more recently has been Head of Youth Development at Stoke City and currently holds a similar position at Plymouth Argyle. * Howard Radford - the former Bristol Rovers goalkeeper played occasional matches for Henfield as an outfield player and scored a hat-trick in an evening Berkeley Hospital Cup match. For a short period the club formed a sister club called Bitterwell Rangers AFC that played in the Bristol & District Sunday League. The Kendleshire Golf Club The Kendleshire Golf Club Practice area at the Kendleshire Golf Club This parkland course is located five minutes from the M32, to the north east of Bristol. The Hollows & Ruffet Courses were opened in the summer of 1997 to much acclaim. Designed by Adrian Stiff, the courses were set into the rolling Frome valley with plenty of water and an exciting combination of holes from the forgiving to the challenging. In the summer of 2002 the two courses were joined by the Badminton Course, designed by Peter McEvoy to follow the same lines but with his very own twist. In addition there is the Academy Course which is a six-hole, par three practice course. There are also two putting greens, either side of the clubhouse. Built at the same time, and to the same standards, as the greens on the championship course, the putting greens show the same level of maturity, matching the conditions of the main greens. There is also a practice range, two bars, a restaurant and a function room. Education The hamlet is served by The Manor C of E Primary School, Coalpit Heath, a primary school currently catering for pupils aged 5‚Äì11. Older children attend The Ridings Federation Winterbourne International Academy.

Situated on Front Street one block east of Yonge Street, it was the City of Toronto's official centennial project, commemorating the 1967 Canadian Centennial.About the St. Lawrence Centre It houses two auditoriums, the 868-seat Bluma Appel Theatre and the 499-seat Jane Mallett Theatre. Facility The centre is municipally owned and was operated from 1983 to 1987 by CentreStage Company (named Toronto Arts Foundation 1964-73, then Toronto Arts Productions 1973-83). General managers of the St. Lawrence Centre have included Mavor Moore 1966-70, Leon Major 1970-80, Victor C. Polley 1980-1, Bruce Swerdfager 1981-5, Michael Noon circa 1985-94, David Wallett circa 1996-2007, and James Roe in 2007. The -million St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts was designed by Gordon S. Adamson and Associates. It opened on 2 February 1970 after eight years of planning and construction. The building originally housed the 863-seat \\"Theatre\\" and the 483-seat \\"Town Hall\\". Bluma Appel Theatre The \\"Theatre\\" was initially adaptable for thrust stage, proscenium, and caliper formations, and was used for dramatic presentations until 1982, when it was redesigned by The Thom Partnership (Toronto) and the Theatre Projects Consultants. During the -million renovation, the thrust stage was removed, a balcony and boxes helped increase seating, and an optional orchestra pit was provided. It reopened on 19 March 1983 as the Bluma Appel Theatre, in honour of a major donor, Bluma Appel. Additional restorations to the Centre's theatres and exterior were completed in 2007 by 3rd Uncle Design Inc (Toronto); the -million construction cost was shared by the city and the Centre's patrons. The Bluma Appel Theatre has been the Canadian Stage Company‚Äôs main stage for over 25 years. Jane Mallett Theatre The \\"Town Hall\\" was renamed the Jane Mallett Theatre in November 1984, in memory of Canadian actress Jane Mallett. It is used mainly for recitals, chamber concerts, public debates, stage and film presentations. History Louis Applebaum was music consultant 1968-71. Franz Kraemer was music director 1971-9, succeeded by a team: Costa Pilavachi, music administrator, and Paul Robinson, director of music programming. Robinson resigned in 1980 and Pilavachi continued in sole charge of music until Jane Forner replaced him in 1982. In the 1970s and 1980s, music presentations at the St Lawrence Centre for the Arts included several annual series and a broad spectrum of chamber music performances, in addition to special series and events. Canadian Sound, a festival of music by Canadian composers and performers, was presented in 1976. The Orford String Quartet presented a Beethoven series during the 1982-3 season. In addition to its regular chamber series in 1984-5, CentreStage Music (the concert arm of CentreStage) presented its 17-day Bach 300 festival at the St Lawrence Centre and various venues throughout the city. Among others who used the Centre's facilities, COMUS Music Theatre presented the staged premiere of John Beckwith's The Shivaree in the Town Hall in April 1982, and the Canadian Opera Company Ensemble mounted Cosi fan tutte in the Bluma Appel Theatre in 1985. CentreStage Music ceased its operations on 1 July 1987, and the St. Lawrence Centre became, for musical events, a rental house. The Centre has since hosted a wide variety of performers, including the Gryphon Trio; the St Lawrence and Tokyo string quartets; Marc-Andr√© Hamelin; Jon Kimura Parker; the Chamber Players of Toronto; MegaCity Chorus; Nexus; the ORIANA Women's Choir; Youth and Music Canada; and the Elmer Iseler Singers, who premiered Pimooteewin: The Journey (Melissa Hui, composer; Tomson Highway, librettist) at the Centre in February 2008. Festivals held at the Centre have included the New Wave Composers Festival and the Luminato arts festival.

ISSN 1368-485X Development Designer Chuck Slusarczyk established himself as a hang glider designer in the early 1970s, including producing engine power units for hang gliders. In October 1979, his company, Chuck's Glider Supplies was renamed CGS Aviation. In 1980 Slusarczyk surveyed pilots at Sun 'n Fun and AirVenture to find out what they wanted in a new ultralight aircraft design. The survey revealed pilots were looking for: *an enclosed cockpit with removable doors *three axis controls *flaps and not flaperons *struts in place of cable- bracing *the choice of tricycle gear, with a steerable nose wheel or conventional landing gear, with a steerable tail wheel *pusher configuration When the resulting Hawk first flew in January 1982 it was the first ultralight aircraft with an enclosed cockpit and to use strut bracing. The aircraft was intended to meet the requirements of the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category, including that category's maximum empty weight. The Hawk wing is strut-braced, constructed from aluminum tubing and covered with either pre- sewn Dacron envelopes or doped aircraft fabric. The wing also features flaps. The fuselage is of similar construction and uses a curved boom tube for its main structural member. The curved tube allows the tail to be located higher, out of the wing's downwash, especially when the flaps are extended. Landing gear for all models is optionally tricycle or conventional. The Hawks are available as aircraft kits, quick-build kits, or completed aircraft. Operational history The Hawk was first introduced to the public at Sun N Fun in March 1982 in Lakeland, Florida. The prototype won Best New Design for 1982. At the EAA Convention held in Oshkosh, Wisconsin that same year the Hawk was named Outstanding New Design and also Reserve Grand Champion. At Oshkosh 1983, the Hawk won the Dupont Kevlar Air Recreational Vehicle Design Competition against more than 126 other designs.

Life and career He read music at Charles University in Prague, and received a PhD for his analysis of the music of The Beatles in 1975. Initially a music writer, critic, and radio/club DJ (1968‚Äì73), he moved into songwriting and music production, becoming a staff producer at Supraphon (1976‚Äì79), where he produced a number of pop, rock, and jazz LPs of Czech singers and bands. He pioneered the use of synthesizers in Czechoslovakia and his music was released by Panton Records and Supraphon, used on TV and in films. He moved to London in 1981, recorded two solo albums (Themes for a One-Man-Band Vol. 1 & 2), and in 1983 worked at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop producing his own music for radio, TV, and films. Goldscheider then co-founded a music and computer company Romantic Robot, which initially designed and sold hardware (Multiprint, Videoface, Multifaces 1, 2, 3, 128 and ST) and published software (Music Typewriter, Trans-Express, Genie, Wriggler) for Sinclair Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Atari ST computers. Romantic Robot became a recording label in 1991, when Goldscheider produced and released a 2-CD set of music written and performed in a Czech concentration camp ‚ÄìTerez√≠n: The Music 1941-44. The set included children's opera Brundib√°r by Hans Kr√°sa, which has since been staged, recorded, and filmed all over the world. In addition to producing another CD (An American in Prague ‚Äì Aaron Copland conducts the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra), Goldscheider has since concentrated on writing, performing, and producing his own compositions, recording classical singers, large choruses, and the Romantic Robot Orchestra on CDs such as Stabat Mater and The Song of Songs, with occasional detours into web design. In June 2018, British record company Little Beat Different released his eponymous vinyl LP Alexander Goldscheider. The first part of his memoirs Intended Coincidences was published in Prague in July 2020. Alexander Goldscheider's grandson Ben is also a musician. He won the Brass Category Final of the 2016 BBC Young Musician competition, playing the French horn.

He is currently serving a lengthy prison sentence in the United States. It has been alleged that Headley made periodic trips to Pakistan for Lashkar-e-Taiba training while simultaneously working as an informant for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), but this is disputed. Under the direction of Lashkar chiefs, Headley performed five spying missions in Mumbai to scout targets for the attacks, which killed 168 people. The following year, he performed a similar mission in Copenhagen to help plan an attack against the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, which had published cartoons of Muhammad. He was arrested at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago while on his way to Pakistan in October 2009. U.S. authorities gave Indian investigators direct access to Headley, but some in India have questioned why the U.S. had not shared suspicions about him with Indian authorities before the Mumbai attacks. At the trial of Tahawwur Hussain Rana, an alleged co-conspirator, Headley gave detailed information about the participation of Pakistan's Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in carrying out the attacks. Since his arrest and guilty plea, Headley has cooperated with U.S. and Indian authorities and given information about his associates. On January 24, 2013, a U.S. federal court sentenced Headley to 35 years in prison for his role in the Mumbai attacks. Headley was prosecuted by a Mumbai special court in early February 2016, via a video link from his prison cell in the United States. He was prosecuted by special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam, the same lawyer who represented the state during the Mumbai attack trials. Early life David Coleman Headley was born as Daood Sayed Gilani in Washington, D.C., to Sayed Salim Gilani (?‚Äì2008) and Alice Serrill Headley (1939‚Äì2008). Sayed Gilani was a well-known Pakistani diplomat and broadcaster.\\"Did not attend funeral of Headley's father: Gilani\\", Economic Times Serrill Headley, originally from Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania and a prominent figure in Philadelphia high society, worked as a secretary at the Pakistani embassy in Washington. Daood Gilani has a younger sister, Syedah, and a half- brother, Danyal. As an adult, Danyal Gilani became the spokesman for Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani and presently serves as Pakistan's press attach√© in Beijing. In 1960, shortly after Gilani was born, his family left the United States and settled in Lahore, the capital of the Pakistani province of Punjab. There, Gilani stood out because of his light skin color‚Äîhe was often called a gora, meaning \\"fair\\", predominantly used for Americans and Europeans‚Äîand because of the heterochromic coloration of his eyes. Gilani's mother was unable to adapt to Pakistani culture and returned to the U.S. Because of Pakistani custody rules, she was forced to leave her children with their father in Lahore. After getting a divorce, she went through four more marriages and spent time in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan.Alice Serrill Headley, born on her father's farm in Laurel, Maryland, 29 July 1939, was a daughter of L. Coleman Headley and his wife, the former Frances Ladd Kercher. She was educated at Catholic schools in the Philadelphia area, ran away from home at age 15, and married five times. After her divorce from Sayed Gilani in the mid-1960s, she wed Shahzada \\"Musleh\\" Muslehuddin (married 1966); the Pakistani movie director Aejay \\"AJ\\" Kardar (married 1969, annulled after four months, died 2002); Richard Pothier (married 1980, divorced circa 1991); and a man named Forrester (married 2006). Information on her birth, parents, marriages, and family is posted at ancestry.com, where it was accessed on 16 October 2010. Daood Gilani was raised in a political environment steeped in Pakistani nationalism and Islamic conservatism, both of which were amplified by Pakistani tensions with India. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, stray bombs hit Gilani's elementary school in Karachi and killed two people; this event, along with Pakistan's defeat at the war's conclusion, is thought to have stoked Gilani's animus towards India. Gilani went on to attend the elite Cadet College Hasan Abdal, a boys' military prep school. Gilani remained in contact with classmates, and later engaged in impassioned debates with them about politics and Islam in e-mail correspondence. In 1977, at the age of seventeen, Gilani left a contentious relationship with his Pakistani stepmother and moved to the U.S. with the help of his biological mother, Serrill Headley. Gilani settled with his mother in Philadelphia, where he helped her manage the Khyber Pass Pub and the adjacent Miss Headley's Wine Bar. Employees at the pub nicknamed him \\"The Prince.\\" Gilani enrolled at a military high school, Valley Forge Military Academy, but dropped out after one semester.http://articles.philly.com/2009-12-13/news/25269328_1_heroin-cases- david-coleman-headley-fbi-agents He was a student at the Community College of Philadelphia but dropped out without a degree in the 1990s.http://articles.philly.com/2009-12-08/news/25270373_1_tahawwur-hussain- rana-daood-gilani-david-coleman-headley In 1985, he married a Pennsylvania State University student, but they divorced two years later due to cultural differences.Headley's ex-wife told reporters, \\"when he would go to Pakistan he would get all riled up again\\" and use words like \\"infidels\\" and \\"when he would see an Indian person in the street, he used to spit, spit in the street\\". He eventually moved to New York City and opened a video rental business. Drug convictions and DEA deal During his frequent trips to Pakistan, Gilani hung out with heroin users and started using the drug himself. He became involved in Pakistani drug trafficking. When he was twenty-four, Gilani smuggled half a kilogram of heroin out of Pakistani tribal areas and used Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a Pakistani army doctor who Gilani knew from military school, as an unwitting shield. Several days later, police in Lahore arrested Gilani for drug possession, but he somehow managed to beat the charges. Rana continued to be used by Gilani over the course of his career as a drug trafficker; in the late 1990s, after Rana had emigrated to the U.S., Gilani used Rana's legitimate immigration consulting company in Chicago to smuggle drugs. In 1988, while he was traveling to Philadelphia from Pakistan, Gilani was arrested by police in Frankfurt, West Germany after two kilos of heroin were found hidden in a false bottom in his suitcase. Gilani quickly made a plea deal when his case was handed over to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, agreeing to surrender his partners in Philadelphia in exchange for a lighter sentence. Gilani's cooperation earned him four years in prison while his two associates were sentenced to eight and ten years. At his sentencing hearing, the judge made the following statement: \\"It's up to you, Mr. Gilani, to do what you can with the rest of your life. You are still a young man. You can either take advantage of this opportunity. Your mother, your lawyer, people said some nice things about you, but what you did, not only to yourself, but to perhaps thousands, hundreds of victims, heroin users in this country is a terrible thing.\\"Interactive: David Coleman Headley's Web of Betrayal, PBS.org. Retrieved 26 July 2013 Gilani managed to overcome his addiction to heroin, but was still involved in the drug trade. In early 1997, Gilani was arrested with another man in a DEA sting operation when he tried to smuggle heroin into the country from Pakistan. Gilani quickly offered his services as a confidential informant to the DEA. In January 1998, the agency sent him to Pakistan to dispel suspicions amongst his partners about his prior absence, and to gain intelligence on the country's heroin trafficking networks. According to the DEA, Gilani's participation led to five arrests and the seizure of 2¬Ω kilos of heroin.Headley 1997 sentencing letter, ProPublica, 24 January 2013 The DEA has insisted that Gilani's 1998 trip to Pakistan was the only one paid for by the agency. While the DEA seemingly made great gains from Gilani's intelligence, there is ample evidence that Gilani abused his status as an informant. He allegedly tried to set up heroin dealers with jailhouse phone calls that were not monitored by DEA agents. A mentally impaired Pakistani immigrant, Ikram Haq, was found to have been tricked into making a drug deal by Gilani, and was subsequently acquitted on the grounds of entrapment when brought to trial. Despite this result, Gilani was released from prison and put on probation for his contribution to the case. One anonymous former associate of Gilani later suggested that he was exploiting his rapport with the DEA, saying, \\"The DEA agents liked him. He would brag about it. He was manipulating them. He said he had them in his pocket.\\" Involvement in terrorism In exchange for information about Pakistani drug contacts, Gilani received a considerably lighter sentence than his co- defendant from the 1997 arrest: fifteen months in jail and five years of supervised release. In November 1998, he was delivered to the low-security Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Dix. There, he became an increasingly devout Muslim. In July 1999, only months into Gilani's sentence, his attorney, Howard Leader, requested permission for him to be given a supervised early release from prison so he could travel to Pakistan to be wed in an arranged marriage. Judge Carol Bagley Amon granted the unusual request. Gilani married a Pakistani woman named Shazia and fathered two children with her. While visiting Lahore, Gilani was introduced to Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a terrorist organization. Gilani made further trips to Pakistan without the knowledge of U.S. authorities, immersing himself in LeT ideology. He befriended LeT's spiritual leader, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, and committed himself to the group's struggle against India, which was supported by the Directorate for Inter- Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistan's premier intelligence service. At the same time this was happening, Gilani resumed work as a DEA informant in New York City and participated in an undercover operation that reportedly led to the seizure of one kilo of heroin. Yet despite working for a U.S. government agency, Gilani actively raised money and recruited new members for LeT, a group that swore allegiance with Al-Qaeda. Gilani would later testify that he discussed his views regarding Kashmir‚Äîthe focus of LeT's militant activities ‚Äîwith his DEA handlers. The DEA has insisted that it was unaware of Gilani's political and religious radicalization. Post-9/11 activities One day after the attacks on September 11, 2001, Gilani's DEA handlers tasked him with collecting counter-intelligence on terrorists through his sources in the drug trade. However, a New York City bartender named Terry O'Donnell reported Gilani to an FBI task force after Gilani's ex-girlfriend told him that Gilani had praised the 9/11 hijackers and \\"got off on watching the news over and over again\\" in the weeks following the attacks. Under questioning by two Defense Department agents, in the presence of his DEA handlers, Gilani denied the accusations and cited his work for the DEA as proof of his loyalty to the U.S. Gilani was cleared, and the DEA did not write a report on his interrogation.The American Behind India‚Äôs 9/11‚ÄîAnd How U.S. Botched Chances to Stop Him, ProPublica, 24 January 2013 On November 16, 2001, six weeks after his interrogation, Leader and Assistant U.S. Attorney Loan Hong made a joint application to Judge Amon asking for Gilani's supervised release to be terminated three years early. Amon agreed to their request and discharged Gilani from any further probation. Leader has claimed that the DEA was involved in the drive to end Gilani's probation, which would have kept him from traveling to Pakistan to continue his intelligence work on terrorists. However, the DEA has claimed that Gilani wanted his probation lifted so he could travel to Pakistan for family reasons. DEA officials also claim that the agency officially deactivated Gilani as an informant on March 27, 2002. Headley himself has claimed that he ended his work for the DEA in September 2002; other agencies claim that he remained a DEA operative as late as 2005. In February 2002, Gilani went to a LeT training camp and did a three-week introductory course on LeT ideology and jihad. That summer, Serrill Headley, who by then had moved to the town of Oxford, Pennsylvania with her brother, confided to friends that her son had become a religious fanatic and had been to terrorist training camps. While Gilani was on a catering visit to his mother's house, one of her friends, Phyllis Keith, noticed that he parked his car behind her residence as if he was trying to hide it. Keith reported Gilani to the FBI office in Philadelphia, which apparently did not follow through with an investigation. That August, Gilani returned to Pakistan and began a second stint at the LeT training camp; he spent his spare time with Shazia in Lahore. Despite being already married in Pakistan, Gilani embarked on a series of affairs in the U.S. and had become engaged to a long-time girlfriend in New York City the month before. In December 2002, after landing in New York City, Gilani was briefly detained by border inspectors who had been on the lookout for unusual travel patterns to hubs of terrorism such as Pakistan. However, the border inspectors found nothing amiss and soon released him. Gilani married his fianc√©e at a Jamaican resort a few days later. In the summer of 2005, Gilani's second wife confronted him after learning about his other marriage, and about his trips to the LeT training camps, from his father. On August 25, 2005, Gilani hit his wife during an argument at his New York video store. After having Gilani arrested for assault, his wife called a government hotline and disclosed his terrorist activities. She was subsequently interviewed three times by the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force. The FBI, citing Gilani's work for the DEA, did not consider him a threat despite the accusations leveled against him in 2001 and 2002. The FBI agent investigating the matter speculated that Gilani's wife made her accusations because she had \\"an axe to grind\\" regarding his other marriage. Gilani was never questioned, and the assault charge was eventually dropped. Gilani later closed his video store. In June 2006, Gilani's second wife, originally from Canada, applied for a green card under a U.S. law for abused spouses. In addition to physical abuse, Gilani's wife made reference to his radicalization and terrorist training; his anti-Semitic and anti-Hindu prejudices; and his praise for suicide bombers. U.S. immigration services granted the green card, but did not alert law enforcement about Gilani because of strict privacy laws governing immigration cases which involve spousal abuse. Mumbai plot Name change and ISI recruitment By 2005, Gilani's training had advanced to the point where he wanted to fight in Kashmir. Instead, Gilani was referred to Sajid Mir, LeT's foreign recruiter. Under Mir's direction, Gilani went to Philadelphia and legally changed his name to David Coleman Headley, taking his mother's surname. Even though Pennsylvania law requires a background check for name changes, state officials apparently did not uncover Headley's previous drug convictions. The name change would make it easier for Headley to hide his Pakistani ancestry and pass as a Westerner, leading anyone he encountered to assume he was a tourist. In January 2006, Headley established ties with Adbur Rehman Hashim \\"Pasha\\" Syed, a retired Pakistan Army major and LeT militant, who put him in touch with Major Iqbal, a mysterious figure who is believed to have coordinated LeT activity through his capacity as an ISI officer. Under sworn testimony, Headley recalled meeting Iqbal and his superior, a Pakistani colonel, in a safe house. Iqbal and Mir reportedly became Headley's ISI handlers and oversaw his training in espionage techniques in preparation for a reconnaissance mission to Mumbai; he met with Iqbal and Mir separately so that the ISI could maintain plausible deniability. In February, Headley was again detained by border inspectors at John F. Kennedy International Airport after returning from Pakistan, and was again released. That month, he contacted his former DEA handler for the final time. In 2007, Headley met a Moroccan medical student in Lahore named Faiza Outalha, eventually marrying her as his third wife; unlike his second wife, Outalha reportedly knew that Headley was already married and approved of the potential arrangement. However, their relationship was strained due to Outalha's progressive views and Headley's unflinching religious conservatism. One reported point of contention was Headley's demand that Outalha wear traditional Muslim clothing for women. In December 2007, Outalha filed assault charges against Headley after getting into an altercation with his servant outside of their house in Lahore. After spending eight days in jail, Headley was reportedly released after Iqbal intervened. Trips to Mumbai Over the course of 2007, LeT's plot for the Mumbai attacks started to materialize, and the Western-looking Headley was considered the ideal militant to perform reconnaissance missions. Using $25,000 supplied to him by Iqbal, Headley opened a Mumbai branch office for Tahawwur Rana's immigration business‚Äîwhich Headley had already used to traffic heroin‚Äîas a front company.https://www.propublica.org/article/mumbai-case-offers-rare- picture-of-ties-between-pakistans-intelligence-serv/ Between 2007 and 2008, Headley made five trips to Mumbai, scouting local landmarks where LeT terrorists would carry out the multi-pronged attack. Headley stayed at the Taj Palace Hotel‚Äîidentified by Iqbal and Mir as their main target‚Äîand surveyed the building using his ISI training, shooting hours of video during in-house tours. Iqbal and Mir were emboldened by Headley's intelligence and decided to make their attack more ambitious in scale. As they expanded their list of targets, Headley scouted the Oberoi Trident Hotel, the Leopold Cafe, and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. When LeT decided to target the Nariman House, a Jewish community center, Headley visited the location posing as a Jew. Headley also took boat tours to look for places where the attackers could reach the city through the waterfront; he found a landing location at a fishermen's slum in the Colaba area of southern Mumbai, where he gathered GPS coordinates. For the maritime reconnaissance, Headley received assistance from a frogman in the Pakistan Navy. Headley lived the high life during his time in Mumbai, and developed a rapport with the very people he was planning to help attack. He joined an upscale gym, frequented nightclubs, and befriended Rahul Bhatt, the son of Bollywood director Mahesh Bhatt, who guided him through the city's party scene. During his stay at the Taj Hotel, Headley acquainted himself with the hotel's staff, reportedly praising the building's architecture. In Colaba, he reportedly tried to attract a young caf√© proprietor. For their 2007 honeymoon, Headley took Outalha with him to Mumbai and stayed at both the Taj Hotel and the Oberoi Trident. The trip ended with an argument between the couple and Outalha was sent back to Lahore. Afterwards, Iqbal and Mir pressured Headley to divorce Outalha, believing she endangered his cover. She responded by reporting Headley to the U.S. embassy in Islamabad, and later submitting to interviews with State Department and ICE officials, describing his Mumbai activities at length. However, Outalha later admitted that she embellished some of her accusations against Headley, leading the Americans to not take her claims seriously. The State Department relayed her warnings to the DEA, the FBI, and the CIA, but whether the agencies acted on them is disputed. After leaving Pakistan, Outalha divorced from Headley. As the attacks unfolded in late November 2008, Headley watched the news coverage at home in Lahore after receiving a text message. The ten LeT militants carried out the attacks per the detailed intelligence gathered by Headley during his trips; the attack would lead to the deaths of 168 people, including six Americans. The intelligence he collected on the Nariman House allowed the terrorists to raid the building and execute its staff, in an act personally supervised by Mir from a command post in Karachi. Shazia, who had moved with her children to Chicago earlier in 2008 and knew of Headley's reconnaissance work for LeT, praised him in a coded e-mail: \\"Congrats on your graduation. Graduation ceremony is really great. Watched the movie the whole day.\\" Denmark plot First visit and Kashmiri allegiance In October 2008, one month before the Mumbai attacks, Mir and Iqbal assigned Headley to scout the Jyllands-Posten newspaper in Copenhagen, which they wanted to attack in retribution for its publication of cartoons of Muhammad. Headley visited the editorial offices of Jyllands-Posten in January 2009, claiming to be interested in buying ad space. After meeting with the paper's advertising executive, Headley drove to Jyllands-Posten's newspaper building in Aarhus and met another executive there. Elsewhere during his trip, Headley collected video footage of Copenhagen, including the offices of Jyllands-Posten; looked into leasing an apartment that could be used by LeT's attack team; and inquired about getting a job as a secretary. After being told by his LeT handlers that the plot would be put on hold, Headley became disenchanted with the group. Syed became Headley's new handler and introduced him to Ilyas Kashmiri, a former Pakistani military commando In congressional testimony, a Heritage Foundation analyst said that Ilyas Kashmiri was a former Pakistani SSG commando and is now the leader of the Harakat-ul-Jihad-i-Islami (HUJI). Roggio writes that Kashmiri is a longtime asset of Pakistan's military and intelligence services and was a commando in the SSG. In the early 1990s, Kashmiri was ordered by the military to join the Harkat-ul Jihad-i-Islami, and later the Jaish-e-Mohammed. When he refused, he dropped out of favor with the military. and leader of Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, an Islamist organization active in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. Kashmiri took over sponsorship of the Denmark plot and made changes to the plan, using the Mumbai attacks as inspiration; he wanted terrorists to storm the Jyllands-Posten offices, have its staff be taken hostage and executed, and then have their severed heads thrown out of the windows of the newsroom in an international media spectacle. Second visit Headley planned to return to Copenhagen during the summer of 2009. Kashmiri put him in contact with two Al-Qaeda operatives called Simon and Bash, who were living in Derby, England. However, when Headley visited Derby on July 26, 2009, Simon and Bash informed him that they did not want to participate in the Denmark plot and were unable to supply weapons, instead giving him US$15,000 in financing. Headley then traveled to Stockholm to meet a veteran militant named Farid. Farid, reportedly agitated, was also unable to help Headley as he was under tight surveillance by Swedish police. When Headley arrived in Copenhagen by train on July 31, he shot video of a Royal Danish Army barracks and approached drug dealers about acquiring guns. Arrest and charges Upon flying to Atlanta, Georgia on August 5, 2009, Headley was questioned by airport inspectors. By this point, the FBI had put Headley on a watch list and engaged in a two-month surveillance operation, debriefing Headley's former DEA handler and reviewing records of past inquiries. Eventually, investigators began to suspect Headley of being involved with the Mumbai attacks. On October 9, Headley was arrested at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport while he was attempting to travel to Pakistan to deliver the footage he collected in Denmark. During his interrogation, Headley gave up information on LeT, al-Qaeda, the ISI, and various terror plots and methods. Supervised by federal agents, he helped set up a trap against a militant in Germany and attempted to lure Sajid Mir out of Pakistan. Despite this, Headley, along with Rana, was charged in his involvement with Kashmiri's plot against Jyllands-Posten. Headley was accused of traveling to Denmark to scout the Jyllands-Posten office and a nearby synagogue. The FBI later additionally charged Headley of conspiring to bomb targets in the Mumbai attacks and providing material support to LeT. India's National Investigation Agency (NIA) registered a case against Headley and Rana for allegedly plotting the Mumbai attacks. After questioning Headley in Chicago for a week, the NIA requested a Delhi court to issue non-bailable warrants to arrest Headley and other conspirators. Indian Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram reported that U.S. authorities shared \\"significant information\\" about the case. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert O. Blake, Jr. promised that India would have \\"full access\\" to question Headley, although the possibility of extraditing him to appeared to be precluded by Headley's plea agreement with U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald. Chidambaram said they would continue to try to get the man extradited. India wants to interrogate Headley or be able to ask him questions in a court testimony, Chidambaram said. Headley's admissions, e.g., that he made video recordings of terrorism targets for the LeT, had corroborated other evidence in the trial of Ajmal Amir Kasab in Mumbai. Ajmal Amir Kasab said that the Mumbai attackers were shown a video of targets in Mumbai at a training camp in Pakistan by LeT leaders. Headley has confessed to making those videos and explaining them to his LeT co-conspirators. A classified Indian report, based on Headley's interrogation by Indian investigators in Chicago, concludes that some of Headley's scouting trips to Mumbai were financed and planned by the ISI. When this report was leaked to U.S. media in October 2010, its conclusions were denied by Pakistani authorities. In March 2009, Headley made another trip to India to conduct surveillance of the National Defence College in Delhi, and of Chabad Houses in various cities in India. Passport issues Indian investigators were surprised at how easily Headley had obtained a visa to enter India, a process that is extremely difficult for Pakistani nationals. Headley's U.S. passport, his new Western and English-sounding name, and the fact that the passport and his visa application made no mention of his prior name or his father's nationality, made it easy for him to obtain an Indian visa from the Indian consulate in Chicago. He falsely stated on his visa application that his father's name was William Headley and that his own name at birth was \\"Headley\\", a claim that was difficult to refute since the U.S. passport, unlike the Indian one, does not provide the father's name, and does not require endorsements on name changes by the passport holder. Indian government officials said that if the name change had been noted on his passport, Indian immigration officials would have been alerted during his multiple visits to India. On his visits to India, Headley befriended several people, including Rahul Bhatt, the son of Mahesh Bhatt, a famous movie producer, who said he never suspected Headley of any wrongdoing. Indian suspicion about U.S. relationship with Headley While government officials in India cite full cooperation by U.S. authorities, the opposition parties and others in India have demanded explanations of why Headley was allowed to travel freely for years between India, Pakistan, and the U.S., and why he was working undercover for the DEA. Some Indian analysts have speculated that David Headley was a double agent for the Central Intelligence Agency that had infiltrated LeT, an accusation denied by the CIA.; \\"Any suggestion that Headley was working for the CIA is complete and utter nonsense. It‚Äôs flat-out false,\\" Paul Gimigliano, from the CIA‚Äôs Office of Public Affairs, said. As soon as Headley was arrested in Chicago, the Indian media had a barrage of questions for the government about him, whose answers were slow in coming. Among other questions, Indian investigators wanted the FBI to share its tapes of Headley's communications with his Pakistani handlers to match with the voices taped on cell phones during the 2008 Mumbai attacks. India is interested in finding out the identity of member A that figured in Headley's jihadi mails. The member A is believed to be none other than retired Pakistan army major Sajid Mir, one of the men who allegedly directed the Mumbai terrorists. Following intense coverage and speculation in the Indian press, U.S. ambassador Timothy J. Roemer in April 2010 told reporters in New Delhi that the United States was working at the \\"highest level\\" to provide India access to Headley, even as it was passing along answers to questions in \\"real time\\". Citing the U.S. legal system, ambassador Timothy Roemer said it was extraordinary to provide direct access to Headley. News reports in October 2010 revealed that U.S. authorities had much advance knowledge about Headley's terrorist associations and activities. Headley's American and Moroccan wives had contacted American authorities in 2005 and 2007, respectively, complaining about his terrorist activities. The Moroccan wife told reporters that she had even shown the U.S. embassy in Islamabad photographs of their stay at the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai, warning them that he was doing something on behalf of Lashkar-e-Taiba. While working for Lashkar, which has close ties to the ISI, Mr. Headley was also enlisted by the Pakistani spy agency to recruit Indian agents to monitor Indian troop levels and movements, an American official said. Since Headley's guilty plea, Home Minister P. Chidambaram was repeatedly asked why the U.S. cannot extradite Headley to India. Analysts in some media outlets have speculated that the United States conspired to have Headley work undercover despite knowledge that he was involved in terrorism. A series of provocative questions about the relationship between the U.S. government and Headley. A summary of attitudes in the Indian press toward the U.S. government's relationship with Headley, possible motives, and the players, as of March 2010. NIA interrogation of Headley In June 2010, US National Security Adviser James Jones announced that India's National Investigation Agency (NIA) had been given access to Headley. The investigation has confirmed that Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists carried out the Mumbai attack under the \\"guidance\\" of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Headley stated that the ISI was engaged with the Lashkar commanders responsible for the Mumbai deaths and injuries at each and every stage of the plot. Headley mentioned that Major Sameer Ali, Major Iqbal and Major Haroon Ashique, who are serving officers of the Pakistan Army, collaborated with the LeT. Headley has also spoken of how after the Mumbai attacks, ISI wanted LeT to disown them in order to prevent global attention to the terror group. Pakistan considers it to be an important strategic asset to be used against India. With Ajmal Kasab as the only terrorist captured, ISI wanted to blame the terrorist act on al- Qaida. It prepared a list of 4-5 al-Qaida figures who were to be projected as the conspirators. The plan, however, did not work due to resistance from Lashkar leaders, particularly Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi. Headley said that while he had started off as a Lashkar recruit, he started drifting towards Al Qaida under the influence of Major Abdul Rahman Saeed, who retired in 2002. Headley was respected by the retired major because of the data which he provided for the Mumbai attack. Saeed, with the help of Ilyas Kashmiri, drafted Headley for the plan to attack the Danish newspaper Jylland Posten, which had published cartoons of Muhammad considered controversial by Muslims. Headley's original handler, Sajid Mir, wanted him to focus on Lashkar's anti-India mission. Headley has claimed that Ishrat Jahan, thought to be a case of staged police \\"encounter killing\\", was a trained L-e-T suicide bomber. On May 31, 2011, however, Headley contradicted his previous statements, and testified that the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) leadership was not involved in planning the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Pune attack claims In relation to the 2010 Pune blast at the German bakery that injured at least 53 people and killed 18, of whom 6 were foreigners, Indian Home Secretary, G. K. Pillai and the Hindustan Times referred to Headley. The Hindustan Times stated that Headley had visited Pune in July 2008 and March 2009 and referred to him as a Lashkar-e-Taiba member. The Hindustan Times also reported that the CCTV footage which was accessed by the Investigating agency, could, per The Hindustan Times, help solve the mystery. The Times of India reported similar reports, along with The Telegraph, The Hindu, The Pioneer and also Indian Express. Review of U.S. handling of Headley The United States Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper conducted a review of slip-ups in handling Headley's involvement in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. His report was shared with India's Union Home Ministry. \\"The review finds that while some information relating to Headley was available to U.S. officials prior to the Mumbai attacks, under the policies and procedures that existed at the time, it was not sufficiently established that he was engaged in plotting a terrorist attack in India. Therefore, the U.S. government did not pass on information on Headley to the Indian government prior to the attacks,\\" Clapper said. Sentencing On January 24, 2013, Headley, then 52 years old, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago to 35 years in prison for his part in the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Headley could have been sentenced to life imprisonment, but federal prosecutors recommended a 35-year sentence in view of Headley's extensive cooperation with the government. Headley had provided details on the operations of the Pakistani terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which planned the Mumbai attacks, and information that he provided to the government led to charges against Tahawwur Hussain Rana and six other terrorist figures. Judge Leinenweber stated that the sentence was sufficient to put Headley \\"under lock and key for the rest of his life\\" so that he would \\"never [be] in a position again to commit a terrorist attack.\\" Others, including survivors of the attacks, have been critical of the sentence, saying that the length of the sentence was an \\"appalling dishonor\\" and that Headley has \\"no right to live.\\" Subsequent developments The day after the sentence was imposed, the Indian government announced that it would continue to seek Headley's extradition to India.David Headley: India for US Mumbai attacker's extradition, BBC (January 25, 2013).

He became the 5th Earl of Balcarres on 25 July 1736 on the death of his brother Alexander Lindsay, 4th Earl of Balcarres. Military career He joined the Royal Navy at the age of 13 and served in it for 12 years. On his return to Scotland he was persuaded to join his father in the 1715 Jacobite rising and took part in the inconclusive Battle of Sheriffmuir. After the suppression of the uprising he was forced to hide for some time in a secret chamber at the nearby castle of Newark until his aunt secured him a pardon. He then joined the army of George I and fought in the War of the Austrian Succession, being present at the Battle of Dettingen in 1743, and the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745. After he left the army, his prospects limited by his past allegiances, he concentrated on improving the house and estate farms at Balcarres.

They range from missionaries and politicians to sports pioneers and philosophers. Over time it was expanded to become an area known as the Nuuanu Cemetery. History It was the first public cemetery in Honolulu, founded in November 1844. Due to the growth in the whaling industry, discussion had started in 1836 on the need for a new burial ground that was not associated with a specific church. The site was purchased for $300 and $350 granted for a house. The money was raised by selling subscriptions on 59 plots of $12 each. Later another were purchased from Gerrit P. Judd to expand in 1860. Rev. Samuel C. Damon served on the cemetery association in the early days. The first recorded burial was American sailor H. Wolley, for $2.50. Crematorium built in 1906 In 1906, the first public crematory in the Hawaiian Islands, designed by architect Oliver G. Traphagen opened at the cemetery. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, all paper currency on the islands was withdrawn and replaced with Hawaii overprint notes, in case the Japanese invaded. Faced with the task of quickly destroying $200 million of cash, the crematory at the cemetery was used to burn it, instead of risking transport to the mainland. However, progress was too slow, so the larger furnace at the Aiea sugar mill was also used. Honolulu Fire Department memorial, 1885 An area called the Seamen's Lot contains many unmarked graves for sailors, provided by the Honolulu Sailor's Home. Another plot is dedicated to firefighters, marked by a monument high. Two dozen were killed by strafing in the December 7, 1941 attack. Oahu Cemetery is located at 2162 Nuuanu Avenue, at the base of the Nuuanu Valley at coordinates . In 1863 King Kamehameha IV built the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii across the street for the Hawaiian royal family. In Punchbowl Crater (to the south) the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific was founded in 1948. Just north of the Royal Mausoleum, the \\"Nuuanu Memorial Park\\" was added in 1949, with its own funeral home. In 1958 a Japanese cemetery was added on adjacent land called \\"Honolulu Memorial Park\\". In 1964, two Columbaria (buildings to store cremated remains) called the Kyoto Gardens were constructed. One of the buildings is a replica of a Buddhist temple. They are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Strictly speaking, the original 1844 cemetery is called \\"Oahu Cemetery\\", although the extended area is often called \\"Nuuanu Cemetery\\" after the area. In 1989 a funeral for Ferdinand Marcos was planned at the mortuary, but instead the body was kept refrigerated at the Byodo-In Temple until it was flown back to the Philippines in 1993.

Saint-Henri fire hall. Ludger Lemieux (February 9, 1872-October 27, 1953) was a Quebec architect who designed a number of notable Art deco structures in Montreal's Saint-Henri district. While he often worked in partnership with Joseph-Honor√© MacDuff, his best-known structure, the Atwater Market, was designed not with MacDuff but with his son Paul M. Lemieux. He was born in Farnham, Quebec to parents Mo√Øse Lemieux and Marie Melanie Serre. He studied at McGill University before his architectural practice after 1897. He was married to Marie Louise Pare and had six children including Paul Marie Lemieux. He worked with Macduff from 1897 to 1918, then on his own until 1931 when his son Paul M. Lemieux (1902-1968) joined to work with father.

The system consists of up to 40 dispensers, each containing 6 mines, mounted on the flat bed version of the Alvis Stormer tracked armoured fighting vehicle. The dispensers can launch mines to the sides and rear of the vehicle as it proceeds. Each mine has a programmable life, after which they self-destruct.

It provided a service similar to that of Muzak. alt=Old metal turntable with thick spindle  Phonograph  The Seeburg 1000 phonograph was introduced in 1959 as model BMS1.Installation Manual, Seeburg '1000' Background Music System, Model BMS1 The system replaced the Seeburg Library Unit, which served the same purpose but played standard 45 rpm records. The Seeburg 1000 is enclosed in a metal cabinet 22 inches (55 cm) wide by 14 inches (35 cm) tall by 12 inches (30 cm) deep. A later version (the Seeburg Background Music Compact, model BMC1) is housed in a windowless, blue and grey painted metal box. This version contains only the record-playing mechanism, without any amplifier or timer built in.Engineer's Manual, Seeburg '1000' Background Music Compact, Type BMC1 The player is capable of playing both sides of up to 28 records and repeating the process indefinitely. The records are stacked on the spindle with the first side to be played on the bottom of the stack. A special tone arm, with two needles (one above and one below), is used to play both sides of each record. A rotating base plate below the records prevents damage to the bottom playing surface while re-stacking the records. A similar weight on top of the stack ensures stable playback of the bottom side of the topmost record. The mechanism causes the lower portion of the spindle to rotate clockwise like an ordinary record player, while the top half of the spindle rotates counterclockwise to permit the bottom of the record to be played in the correct direction. The spindle contains three sets of retractable claws which hold the records in the upper and lower playing positions, and permit one record at a time to be dropped from the upper to the lower playing position. A release button in the top of the spindle permits the operator to retract the record-holding claws to remove the record stack. The BMS 1000 was so called because it played both sides of 25 records, each side containing 20 songs (hence 1,000 songs). The phonographs used the old Pickering \\"Red-head\\" stereo cartridge, introduced on Seeburg jukeboxes in late 1958 for the 1959 model year. Although the mono Seeburg jukeboxes used 1 mil styluses and the stereo Seeburgs used .7 mil styluses, the background-music systems used a .5 mil stylus, but played the special mono records. The BMS phonographs were non-selectable and only played these proprietary formatted 9\\" records with 2\\" center holes - sequentially, and at 16rpm. In 1963, Seeburg introduced the next generation BMS, the BMS2.source: Seeburg 1000 Service Manual, May 1963; and The Always Jukin' Color Guide To Collectible Jukeboxes, 2006 This phonograph has been nicknamed \\"the Microwave\\" in recent years due to its resemblance to the kitchen appliance, and was made for the public view. There was a lighted window where one could see the records playing, and the chrome speaker grille and trim made the little phonograph noteworthy. These BMS2s used transistorized amplifiers. BMS phonographs lacking a power amplifier or internal speaker could have an optional preamplifier. Early preamps were tube-(valve-) type and (after 1963) transistorized. In 1963 the Seeburg BMCA1 \\"Companion Audio\\" speaker/4-watt amp unit became available, using both tubes and transistors. If more power or an amp was needed Seeburg had the HFA4-56, 60-watt tube (valve) amp available.  Records  alt=Orange Muzak record label, with large hole A Seeburg Background Music record is a vinyl record of a non-standard 9 inch (23 cm)-diameter size with a 2 inch (5 cm) center hole. The recording is monaural, with a playing speed of 16‚Öî rpm and a density of 420 grooves per inch. A 0.5 mil diamond stylus is used for reproduction. Each side contains approximately 40 minutes of music (typically 20 songs). Records in each series were numbered 1-28 or 101-128; however, these numbers meant nothing other than where a record belonged in the stack. Initially, the records were distributed four times a year, in sets of five records. In 1966 this changed to sets of 7. The operator was supposed to replace records in the system with new records of the same number (e.g. MM-125). Each box was labeled with the library type, date to place in service, and instructions for the operator (including that each record was to be returned to Seeburg after use). Upon return, the records were destroyed. A Basic library box from 1971 states that the records are the property of \\"Seeburg Music Library, Inc., 1510 N. Dayton St, Chicago 22, Ill\\".  Music  alt=Muzak vinyl record, with light-green label and large hole Seeburg provided three different libraries of music for use with the Seeburg 1000 system: Basic, Mood and Industrial. These library names were changed to Lifestyle, Penthouse, and Upbeat in 1979. The Basic library consisted of mid-tempo music selected from top 40 hits, show tunes and standards. The arrangements (created for Seeburg) were nearly all instrumental, featuring horns, strings and keyboards. The Mood library consisted of medium- to slow-tempo songs in lush arrangements (with primarily stringed instruments). The music was derived from standards, show tunes and some pop music; the first song on each side of each record was often a current pop hit. The Industrial library consisted of lively, medium- to quick-tempo music to induce workers to be more productive. This was perhaps the most varied and adventurous of the libraries; it contained polkas, mariachi music, twangy guitar, Hawaiian songs, and occasionally synthesizer. A portion of the records were exchanged every three months: on April 1, July 1, October 1 and December 26. The number of records changed at each three-month interval was five in 1963, and seven according to record boxes issued in 1966 and later. The first sets of Seeburg 16 rpm records issued in 1959 had a five-pointed star in the space later used for the \\"place-in-use\\" dates. This was superseded by a notice which read \\"Replace No. 1\\", \\"Replace No. 5\\" etc. This meant \\"Replacement Records - Set No. 1\\", \\"Set No. 5\\" etc. In 1961 this was again superseded by the \\"place in use\\" dates, which remained in use through the end of 1975. For the April 1, 1976 sets, the \\"place in use\\" dates were replaced by a code: RR-66. This meant \\"replacement records ‚Äì set #66\\" and the number advanced with each subsequent set. Over time, the records were sent out less on a schedule. The last sets were sent out in 1986 and bore the code R-97. The Christmas holiday season required a special set of records. A box of 25 Christmas records was issued to be played during the month of December. This set consisted of Christmas music, interspersed with non-holiday music. It was the job of the machine operators to replace all Christmas music with standard fare on December 26. This was a large undertaking - in New York, \\"the entire service and installation force, and even the office help, are pressed into service to still the sound of Christmas past for another 11 months.\\"  References   External links  * Seeburg 1000 ‚Äì The Official Page * Live MP3 audio stream, from seeburg1000.com * Tony Miller's Seeburg BMS page * Techmoan: RetroTech: Seeburg 1000 BMS1 Background Music System (1959-1986), YouTube, 28 February 2017 Audio players Easy listening music Industrial music services Music mass media ","title":"Seeburg 1000"},{"id":"25093923","text":"Peter Bock (born December 12, 1948) is a Wisconsin politician.'Wisconsin Blue Book 2002-2002, Biographical Sketch of Peter Bock, pg. 27 Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Bock graduated from Marquette University High School and from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

It is at the southern tip of the Lizard peninsula, in the civil parish of Landewednack. The headland was a communications centre, during the Victorian era with the Lloyds Signal Station, opened in 1872 for shore to ship communications and Marconi's experiments with wireless at the Lizard Wireless Station. Geography The National Trust owned headland is to the east of the Lizard Point, the most southerly point on mainland Great Britain. Between the two headlands is the Lizard Lighthouse and Housel Cove and less than a mile to the north is Church Cove. Bass Point can be reached by following the A3083 from Helston to the end of the road at Lizard village and than walking the final mile along Lloyds Road to the coast. The South-west coastal footpath crosses the headland which is part of the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. History Lloyds Signal Station Before the advent of the telegraph ships had no means of communication with their owners and could only send messages by semaphore, when they were close to the shore. The telegraph reached Falmouth in 1857 and G. C. Fox & Company built a signal station at Bass Point with the intention of laying a telegraph cable from Falmouth. The Post Office intervened and the Lloyds Signal Station was opened on 1 April 1872. Initially communications between ship and shore were by flags and the messages were then sent to Helston by post or by horse rider. On 2 June 1872 a cable reached the signal station and the Post Office opened an office at the station. Night signals by coloured lights, gun, rocket and steam whistles began in November 1872 and William Broad & Sons, also of Falmouth opened an office next door. The companies combined their operations in 1875 and by 1877 over one hundred vessels a month were using the station. It has been restored to recreate the original radio room and may be visited.Clegg, David (2005) Cornwall & the Isles of Scilly: the complete guide. Leicester: Matador; p. 188 Marconi constructed two wireless stations on the Lizard; the main, larger station being at Poldhu on the west coast. In 1900 he made the first ever ‚Ä≤over the horizon‚Ä≤ radio signal to the Isle of Wight. The former HM Coastguard station at Bass Point was the first location refurbished by the voluntary National Coastwatch Institution, in 1994, following the deaths of two local fishermen close to the point. Natural history Bass Point is part of the Caerthillian to Kennack Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and since August 2016 is included within The Lizard National Nature Reserve (NNR). In recent years the National Trust has removed Hottentot fig (Carpobrotus edulis), an introduced plant, which forms mats covering the coastal grassland.

The character of Jamie was created as a temporary love interest for Hannah and was intended to feature only in Hollyoaks Later, the spin-off from the Hollyoaks series. In October 2009, it was announced that Jones was to reprise his role of Finn for the departure of Hannah. Of Jamie's return, a Hollyoaks source commented: \\"Hannah's had a terrible time of late and Jamie's sudden arrival in the village next year reopens a wound that's only just started to heal.\\" Hannah goes to a music festival with her brothers Rhys (Andrew Moss) and Josh Ashworth (Sonny Flood) where she meets Jamie.

Jamie tells Hannah that he is no longer dealing drugs, however Hannah asks him to leave. Hannah tells Jamie to leave before Rhys finds him. Rhys tells Jamie to stay away from Hannah. Jamie then calls Hannah and tells her that he loves her. Hannah's friend Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) meets Jamie and takes a dislike to him after becoming concerned for Hannah's safety. Hannah later meets up with Jamie who is in pain, and realises that Rhys beat him up. Jamie asks Hannah to leave with him and kisses her. Hannah responds, but insists that their relationship has to be on her terms. Hannah's husband Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson) asks Jamie for drugs after he and Rhys plan to set Jamie up. Jamie tells Darren that he does not deal drugs. Suzanne attempts to find out how serious Jamie and Hannah's relationship is and shows him Hannah's video diary whilst she was suffering from anorexia nervosa. Jamie is shocked but tells Suzanne that he will take care of Hannah. As Jamie goes to meet Hannah, he is stopped and beaten. He is thrown into the boot of a car and dumped in the woods by Rhys and Darren, where Rhys tells him to stay away from Hannah. Jamie returns to The Dog in the Pond and when Hannah asked him what happened, he points at Rhys and Darren. Jamie is worried when he gets a text from Blue (Kyle Rees) and begins to panic. Jamie then persuades Hannah to leave the following day. At Hannah's leaving party, Jamie receives a call from Blue and quickly begins to pack his bag. Whilst packing, Jamie discovers that the money from his bag is missing. When Blue calls again for the missing money, Jamie begins to panic and sends Hannah out whilst he looks for it. Jamie finds out that Rhys has the money and Rhys gives him an ultimatum, to leave with the money alone, or leave without it with Hannah. When Hannah's family say goodbye to her, Jamie arrives late. Jamie and Hannah stay in a hotel after their flight is delayed and Hannah finds their room trashed. Jamie returns to find Blue with Hannah and admits that he stole the money and explains that he no longer has it. Jamie calls Rhys to prove that he does not have the money, but Rhys denies any involvement. Jamie and Blue fight and as Jamie struggles to defend himself, he reaches for a letter opener and stabs Blue. Hannah begs Jamie to call an ambulance, but he refuses and asks her to leave Blue and go on the run with him. Hannah says she is not leaving until an ambulance is called and Jamie agrees. Jamie then tries to leave and when Hannah refuses, he grabs their bags and drags Hannah to the door. Jamie finds Darren at the door and attempts to leave, but Darren refuses to move. Hannah tells Darren she loves Jamie and they rush down the corridor, but the police confront them. Jamie becomes angry and thinks that Darren called them, but Hannah tells him that she called them. Jamie then pulls the letter opener from his pocket and points it in Hannah's back. He begins to usher her out of the building and warns the police that if they try to stop him, he will kill Hannah.

Set in the US around the turn of the 21st century, it gently pokes fun at life, manners, morals as well as the tensions within the modern LGBT and liberal communities. It stars lesbian actress Cathy DeBuono. Synopsis The story follows the main characters Rose a comfortably out woman who identifies as lesbian and Anthony a decent progressive heterosexual man who serendipitously meet and then unexpectedly find themselves falling for each other. Rose has to navigate the reaction of her friends (they aren't thrilled) and her family (they are) while Anthony too has to deal with his friends who are equally nonplussed. Production The story was written and produced by Kyle Schickner, who is a bisexual rights activist as well as being a film producer, writer, director and actor. It began as a successful Off-Off-Broadway Production in 1996 at New York City's Sanford Meisner Theater which was turned into a well received 1997 Indie film by Schickner's FenceSitter Films. In 2008/2009 FenceSitter Films began working with an American Cable TV Network to spin-off Rose by Any Other Name ... into a weekly TV series. Controversy According to Schickner after production had gotten underway \\"at the 11th hour as they were setting up to shoot the pilot the network expressed concern over how the cutting-edge social theme might play with some of their core viewership and decided to look at more data to see what kind of response the show might get\\". So with the assistance of American Institute of Bisexuality the project was turned into a Web series with each Webisode being posted on the FenceSitter Films YouTube channel. Episodes 7‚Äì9 and 11 are no longer available on said channel due to a successful copyright claim.https://www.youtube.com/user/fencesitterfilms#p/c/1480F27A3206E9FF/9/89qvLFAd64A See also * List of media portrayals of bisexuality * Bisexual community * Chasing Amy * Bob & Rose References External links * 1990s romantic comedy films 1996 plays 1997 films American films American LGBT-related films American LGBT-related television shows American sex comedy films Female bisexuality in film Bisexuality-related television series American comedy web series Films based on Romeo and Juliet Lesbian-related films Lesbian-related television shows LGBT-related plays American LGBT-related web series Modern adaptations of works by William Shakespeare Plays and musicals based on Romeo and Juliet Live action television shows based on films FenceSitter Films films LGBT-related adaptations of works by William Shakespeare 1990s sex comedy films 1997 comedy films LGBT-related romantic comedy films ","title":"Rose by Any Other Name..."},{"id":"25094012","text":"\\"X-Men: Misfits\\" is an original English-language manga version of the X-Men story created by Dave Roman, Raina Telgemeier, and art by Anzu. Published in 2009, it is owned by both Del Rey Manga and Marvel. The book is the story of Kitty Pryde and her time at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. The book appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list for paperback graphic novels for at least five weeks. Plot Kitty Pryde has always been an outcast at school especially when her mutant genes kick in. Shortly after she is visited by a teacher at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. When Kitty arrives at the school she finds she is the first female student at the school, the only other girls being the teachers Jean Grey, and Ororo Munroe (Storm). She is taken in by the HellFire Club, a group of hot headed mutants. Settings The story takes place at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters (X-Mansion). The areas shown are the Danger Room, Cafeteria, Girls Wing, and Class Rooms. Characters ;Kitty Pryde :The main character of X-Men Misfits. Kitty feels like she is an outcast even after she begins attending Xavier's School. She is a mutant who has the power to walk through anything. Her powers kick in during school one day. She is given a scholarship to Xavier's School by Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto). She is the first female student of Xavier's School. On her first day at school she meets Bobby (Iceman) who acts very cold to her, and she is taken in by the members of the HellFire Club. Her family owns the family restaurant Pryde of Chicago. She has two sisters, Sarah and Lindsay, aged 14 and 17. She has two piercings on her right ear. ;Pyro (John Allerdyce) :A student at Xavier's school. He is a member of the HellFire club and Kitty's (ex)boyfriend. He is a mutant with power over fire. He has a snobbish attitude and sees mutants as the superior race. He loves to cause trouble and is extremely protective of Kitty. Pyro is definitely a hot - headed guy who is normally mean to anyone outside the HellFire Club. He goes by Pyro instead of his human name. ;Bobby (Iceman) :The first student Kitty is introduced to when she enters the school, he acts pretty cold around her and most everyone else, save for a few certain people. He is a mutant with the power over ice. He is very different from Pyro; even though he gives off a cold attitude he is nicer than Pyro. He does not see the mutants as a superior race and this is shown because he still uses his real name. He may act cold to Kitty but he does like her a lot, especially after she tries to protect him during the school trip to New York. ;Magneto :A physics teacher at Xavier's school and an alpha mutant who has the power over metal. He is the one who gave the scholarship to Kitty in the beginning. He sees mutants as the superior race and believes that all mutants should go by their mutant name and abandon their mortal ones. He is the main contributor to the HellFire club who agree with his philosophy. He tends to stray from his lessons in physics and more toward his philosophy and politics, especially on Mutant Rights. When Kitty has her first class with him, he tells her to call him Magneto. (She says \\"Magneato?\\") ;Xavier (Professor X) :The founder of Xavier's school. He is an alpha mutant who can read people's minds. In the beginning of the series Xavier can walk, but after a trip to New York loses the ability. He sees the humans and mutants as equals. Most of the mutants at the school see the way he does. He is good friends with Magneto. ;Angel (Warren Kenneth Worthington III) :Another student at Xavier's school who - as his mutant name states - has angel wings. He is the leader of the HellFire club and is very conceited and egotistic. He's also an incredible flirt and hardly knows what \\"no\\" means. As soon as he meets Kitty, he begins flirting with her and asks her to be his girlfriend, but she turns him down. He boasts that 'Countless girls would throw themselves on a cross for me'. ;Havok (Alex Summers) :He is the brother of Scott Summers and another student at Xavier's school. He is a mutant with the power of shooting destructive plasma blasts. He is a member of the HellFire Club and hates his brother Scott. He, like the rest of the members of the HellFire club, hates humans and thinks that mutants are better, thus throwing away his human name and taking his mutant one. He loses control on the trip to New York, causing Xavier to lose his ability to walk. ;Forge :He is yet another member of the HellFire club with the power over mechanics. He seems to be the group's most technical guy and becomes really close with Kitty, which Pyro despises. Kitty views him as the \\"brother she never had\\". ;Longshot :His human name is Vince and he too is a member of the HellFire club. He can shoot anything with perfect aim, as shown when he shoots acorns at human rights protesters. He has the same philosophy as the other members of the club about humans and mutants. ;Quicksilver :Another member of the HellFire club. He is very fast and also shares the club's philosophy, although not much is known about him at this time. ;Kurt (Nightcrawler) :A mutant at the school with the power of transportation. His appearance is blue skin, pointed ears, and a tail, along with markings all over his body. He is Kitty's first training partner in Gym class. He and Kitty become good friends right away. ;Fred (Blob) :A friend of Kitty's. He is really nice to her but can get on some people's nerves when he does not think. They become friends right away. ;Scott Summers (Cyclops) :A student at Xavier's school and Havok's brother. He fires optic blasts out of his eyes, though he does not have the best control yet so he wears special glasses. He and his brother do not exactly see eye to eye. He agrees with Xavier's philosophy, unlike Havok who agrees with Magneto's. He and Kitty are friends and he's strictly vegan. ;Gambit :He is never introduced but shows up several times throughout the first volume. He is a great cook and that is how Kitty first meets him. They meet when she is looking to sneak a snack after hiding from the HellFire club. Gambit was in the kitchen making a dessert and lets her try one. He becomes an acquaintance of Kitty. ;Ms. Munroe (Storm) :She is the environmental teacher at Xavier's school and has the power over weather. She takes on the appearance punk-Storm, sporting a mohawk and wearing very punk-like clothing. She is a good friend of Xavier's. ;Beast :He is never introduced by name but he teaches math at the school. He seems to dislike Pyro a lot due to Pyro's attitude. ;Professor Rasputin (Colossus) :The history teacher at Xavier's School. Not much has been told about him yet. ;Jean Grey :She is only mentioned to be out scouting other mutants for the school in the first volume. She can also be seen on the plaque of teachers, on page 171. ;Sabretooth (Victor Creed) :Shown as a sort of servant to the HellFire club, his only appearance being in the luncheon Kitty is dragged to early in the manga. He retains a beast-like appearance. After acting a bit rude to Kitty, he is scolded by Longshot \\"Come now Sabretooth...is that anyway to behave in front of a lady?\\".

The AOC regulations also allow up to 15 per cent total of Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris as accessory grapes in the red wines,AOC regulations, last updated 2006 but this is not very often practiced. The allowed base yield is 40 hectoliter per hectare of red wine and 45 hectoliter per hectare for white wine. The grapes must reach a maturity of at least 10.5 per cent potential alcohol for village-level red wine, 11.0 per cent for village-level white wine and Premier Cru red wine, and 11.5 per cent for Premier Cru white wine. Premiers Crus There are 22 climats in Savigny-l√®s-Beaune classified as Premier Cru vineyards. The wines of these vineyards are designated Savigny-l√®s-Beaune Premier Cru + vineyard name, or may labelled just Savigny-l√®s-Beaune Premier Cru, in which case it is possible to blend wine from several Premier Cru vineyards within the AOC.

Family and education Kilmartin was born in Albany, New York, and grew up in Topeka, Kansas. He graduated from Washburn University, where he was a member of the Kansas Beta Chapter of Phi Delta Theta. During his junior year there he was recognized as one of the ten most outstanding men on campus with his selection for induction into the school‚Äôs Sagamore Society.See the History of Phi Delta Theta at Washburn University at Family His first wife, Irma Lee Kilmartin, preceded him in death. His second wife, Patti survived him. In all, Kilmartin was the father of four sons and five daughters. At the time of his death, they had 17 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Retail career Following service in the Pacific with the Navy during World War II, Kilmartin began a 40-year career in the retail sector. When Dayton Hudson purchased the 55 Mervyn's Departments Stores in 1978, he took the reins as the company's CEO. Backed by Dayton Hudson's financial resources, Mervyn's embarked on a remarkable course of expansion. By the mid-1980s, the chain was operating 148 stores. In 1984, Mervyn's opened nine stores in Texas ‚Äî its first adventure outside the western United States ‚Äî and posted a $223.3 million profit on sales of more than $2 billion. The following year, Mervyn's contributed 37% of Dayton Hudson's operating profit. Under Kilmartin's leadership, Mervyn's was highly regarded in the retail industry in the mid-1980s, when many of its competitors for the mid-range department store customer were floundering. During this time, many of Mervyn's rivals retooled themselves, adopting many of Mervyn's best ideas. J. C. Penney, for example, abandoned its old identity as a full-line department store, and, like Mervyn's, focused on apparel and soft goods. Moreover, competitors began publishing their own tabloid advertisements, imitating the marketing tactic Mervyn's had used for decades. Perhaps most importantly, several retailers across the retailing spectrum began selling department store-quality goods at discounted prices. Kilmartin took mandatory retirement from the company in 1986. He remained active in his retirement. He served on the boards of several retail companies and founded the Retail Management Institute at Santa Clara University.See the website of the RMI at Community activities and tributes Kilmartin was a devout Roman Catholic and a recipient of the Assumpta Award given by the Archbishop and Regents of Saint Mary‚Äôs Cathedral in San Francisco for his outstanding service and example as a Catholic layman. Kilmartin made the pilgrimage to Lourdes five times. He was a member of the Order of Malta since 1980. He served on the Board of Trustees at Santa Clara University and the Bay Area Council and was an active member of the Capitol Club. He was a past vice-president of United Way of the Bay Area. Between 1988 and 1992, he was a trustee of the San Francisco Foundation. At Washburn University, the John F. Kilmartin Business Leaders Scholarship Fund is named in his honor. The Silicon Valley Community Foundation established the Kilmartin Educational Fund to recognize his contribution to the community.

The company relied on the base of the Krak√≥w‚ÄìUpper Silesia Railway (; ), opened in 1847.

Oliver (1864‚Äì1934), was a prominent Scottish political writer and businessman who advocated tariff reform and imperial union for the British Empire. He played an important role in the Round Table movement, collaborated in the downfall of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith's wartime government and its replacement by David Lloyd George in 1916, and pressed for \\"home rule all round\\" to resolve the political conflict between Britain and Irish nationalists. Education and business career Oliver was born on 20 February 1864 to Catherine McLaren and John Scott Oliver. His grandfather was Duncan McLaren. His father was a merchant and he attended Edinburgh University. He then went to Trinity College at Cambridge University, where he became a lifelong friend of Austen Chamberlain and his imperial- minded father, Joseph Chamberlain. Oliver practiced law for three years, but he abandoned this career because he wanted to marry his first cousin Katharine Augusta McLaren. He joined the linen drapery firm of Debenham & Freebody which enable him to marry. He becoming a partner in 1904.Stephen Gwynn, ed., The Anvil of War: Letters between F.S. Oliver and His Brother 1914‚Äì1918 (London: Macmillan, 1936), 6‚Äì7. The company was extraordinarily successful and he was a rich man by 1914. Major writings and political thought A lifelong Unionist Party (UK) member, Oliver expressed his political leanings in a series of books, pamphlets, and newspaper articles. In one of his first pamphlets, The Statesman and the Bishop, he came out in favour of Imperial Federation, saying that: \\"‚Ä¶ the union of the British race, the firm and effective federation of our people in all quarters of the earth, appears to me to be of such transcendent importance as a matter of both morals and of politics, that if the achievement of it required a sacrifice instead of a gain, I should be prepared to make it. \\"The desire for union, the grand Federal Idea, comes first, and a long way first among my motives.\\"Gwynn, Anvil, 8. In 1906 Oliver published the biography Alexander Hamilton, which used the example set by the federalists of the early United States to argue for a federal arrangement for the British Empire.Gwynn, Anvil, 13. The book came to the attention of Lord Alfred Milner and the members of \\"Milner's Kindergarten,\\" who were then engaged in the reconstruction of South Africa following the Boer War of 1899‚Äì1902. According to Leo Amery, a friend of the kindergarten, \\"Alexander Hamilton became the Bible of the young men of Milner‚Äôs Kindergarten.\\"John E. Kendle, The Round Table Movement and Imperial Union (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1975), 129. In 1934 The Times asserted, \\"The book had probably more influence than any other political book of the decade.\\"Kendle, Round Table, 126. Novelist John Buchan, another friend of the Kindergarten, believed that Oliver had \\"a real and enduring influence on political thought.\\"Kendle, Round Table, 125. Oliver's biography of Hamilton was also influential in the United States.Merrill D. Peterson, The Jefferson Image in the American Mind (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1998), pp. 333‚Äì334. Oliver had interpreted the Hamilton‚ÄìJefferson rivalry as a conflict between two ideologies and types of statesmanship: the one based on reality, the other duped by illusion; the one commanding, the other led by circumstances; the one nationalist, the other individualistic.Peterson, The Jefferson Image in the American Mind, p. 337. Theodore Roosevelt praised the book and sent copies to Henry Cabot Lodge and Whitelaw Reid, and Walter Lippmann hailed it as \\"one of the noblest biographies in our language\\". According to Newton D. Baker, Woodrow Wilson also greatly admired the book.Peterson, The Jefferson Image in the American Mind, p. 343. Oliver also wrote numerous political articles for The Times using the pseudonym \\"Pacificus\\". These articles, which first appeared in May 1910, outlined his federalist ideas, especially his proposal for the establishment of separate parliaments in the United Kingdom to deal with purely local issues, while a supreme parliament would be responsible for national and Imperial concerns.Kendle, Round Table, 183; Gwynn, Anvil, 18‚Äì19. Even while advocating the creation of parliaments for Britain and the Empire as a whole, Oliver was deeply critical of British democracy. He expressed these feelings in private, such as a letter he wrote during World War I that said, \\"‚Ä¶Democracy is not going to win this war or any other ‚Äì if we win, it will be because the spirit of the small remnant who hate and despise democracy and all its works will save the country in spite of its democratic government.\\"A.M. Gollin, Proconsul in Politics: A study of Lord Milner in opposition and in power (New York: Macmillan, 1964), 247. His attitude led him to play a part in the fall of the Asquith government later in the war as a member of the so-called \\"Monday Night Cabal.The term is used by A.M. Gollin in his study of Lord Milner. Another Round Table scholar, J.E. Kendle, uses the term \\"ginger group.\\"\\" \\"Milner‚Äôs Kindergarten\\" and the Round Table movement Oliver‚Äôs book Alexander Hamilton brought him into contact with \\"Milner‚Äôs Kindergarten\\" in 1906, and most of its members returned to England in 1909 when it became clear that British South Africa would be unified. Led by Lord Milner, Lionel Curtis, and Philip Henry Kerr, the Kindergarten held a series of meetings to establish the Round Table movement, having as its immediate goal the federation of the British Empire. Oliver also attended the meetings, most notably at Plas Newydd, where most of the planning was completed, and once the Round Table was established, he maintained a \\"keen\\" interest in its affairs for the rest of his life.Kendle, Round Table, 63. A member of the movement‚Äôs central committee, or \\"Moot,\\" he helped to edit The Round Table Journal during the latter half of World War I, and contributed his own anonymous articles.Gwynn, Anvil, 17‚Äì18. The \\"Monday Night Cabal\\" After World War I broke out in 1914, Oliver and many of his friends in the Round Table felt frustrated by the policies of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. Like Oliver, a number of Round Table members, most notably Lord Milner, also distrusted British democracy, and they began to look for ways to replace Asquith with someone who shared their ideas. They especially pressed for \\"national service,\\" or conscription, to replace Britain‚Äôs volunteer army, a position Oliver had held even before war with Germany broke out.Gwynn, Anvil, 21. Each Monday night a group of these and other men met to discuss strategies for deposing Asquith. The main members included: Oliver, Lord Milner, Lord Carson, Geoffrey Robinson (known from 1917 as Geoffrey Dawson), Waldorf Astor, General Henry Wilson, Philip Kerr, Leander Starr Jameson, and David Lloyd George. In 1916 the Asquith government finally fell and was replaced by Lloyd George, whereupon the new government carried out such measures as conscription in an attempt to make a stronger military effort in the war.Kendle, Round Table, 183. Since not all of these men were Round Table members, some historians argue that the activities of the Monday Night Cabal were not Round Table-related,Kendle, Round Table, 183. while others see them as part of a larger pattern of attempts by the Round Table to influence political events from behind-the-scenes.Carroll Quigley, The Anglo-American Establishment: From Rhodes to Cliveden (New York: Books In Focus, 1981), 140‚Äì41. Later years and death Following World War I, Oliver reduced his political activities, though he remained a member of the Round Table and continued writing books and essays. He was particularly disappointed by the political settlement reached with Ireland, which ran counter to his desire for a federalized system for Britain and Ireland. In 1916 he bought a house at Edgerston near Jedburgh and in 1926 he retired from Debenhams.Gwynn, Anvil, 28. In 1928 he bought Queen Mary's House in Jedburgh which he gave to the town. Katharine Augusta Oliver opened the house in 1930. Oliver died on 3 June 1934 at Edgerston and was buried in the local churchyard.

His works have been translated into 40 languages, making him the most translated Croatian writer, and his books have come out in 200 different editions at home and abroad. His dramas and comedies have had more than 330 theatre first nights around the world and have been seen by more than two million theatre attendants. Career Miro Gavran was born May 3, 1962.IMDb.com He debuted in 1983 with the drama Creon's Antigone, speaking out forcefully about political manipulation. This was followed three years later by the drama Night of the Gods, the theme being the relationship between the artist and the powers-that-be under a totalitarian system. He then wrote a cycle of plays concentrating on male-female relations, in which his heroes were often great historical persons. He has created a series of complex female characters. His heroines are both strong and emotional. He has written some forty plays to date, including Death of an Actor, All About Women, All About Men, George Washington's Loves, Chekhov Says Good-Bye to Tolstoy, How To Kill The President, Greta Garbo's Secret, Parallel Worlds, Nora in Our Time, My Wife's Husband, Dr Freud's Patient... \\"Creon's Antigone\\", \\"Night of the Gods\\" and \\"George Washington's Loves\\" have been listed by the German publisher Anton Hiersemann in their selection of best theatrical works for the period between 2000 and 2003. He is the only living dramatist in Europe to have a theatre festival devoted solely to his plays outside his/her homeland; the Gavranfest has been held in Slovakia since 2003. There have been first nights of his plays throughout the world, in: Rotterdam, Washington, D.C., Moscow, Rio de Janeiro, Paris, Buenos Aires, Waterford, Mumbai, Bratislava, Prague, Ljubljana, Sarajevo, Krakow, Belgrade, Budapest, Athens, Augsburg, Vienna and Sofia. In 2010 he was named one of the nominees for the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award. He managed to get ten of his novels published: Forgotten Son, How We Broke Our Legs, Klara, Margita or A Journey into a Former Life, Judith, John the Baptist, Pontius Pilate and The Only Witness to Beauty, along with a collection of short stories entitled Small Unusual People. Last novel is \\"A Few Birds and One Sky\\". In his early novels, he describes life in the Croatian provinces, featuring everyday folk, anti-heroes of sorts, who retain a positive stance towards life even when they are confronted with injustice and major difficulties. This is perhaps best seen in his novel, Forgotten Son (1989), in which the central personage is a slightly mentally challenged young man of twenty. As a forty-year-old, Gavran started to write psychological- existential novels inspired by biblical characters, bringing them nearer to the sensibilities of contemporary readers. These books have been popular with both believers and non-believers, since their messages are universal. Gavran has received more than twenty literary awards in Croatia and abroad, including the CENTRAL EUROPEAN TIME Award, given annually in Budapest to the best Central European author for overall opus, as well as the EUROPEAN CIRCLE Award given to writers for the confirmation of European values in their texts. With insight and humour, Miro Gavran has written eight books for children and young people: All Sorts of Things in My Head, How Dad Won Mum, Head Over Heels in Love, Happy Days, Farewell Letter, Plays with a Head and a Tail, Try to Forget and The Teacher of My Dreams. These books have also found their way to adult readers. Gavran earned his degree in Dramaturgy at the Academy of Theatre, Film and Television in Zagreb. He first worked as a dramaturge and theatre director at the famous ITD Theatre in Zagreb. Since 1993, he has been living and working as a free-lance, professional writer. His theatre and prose texts have been included in numerous anthologies in Croatia and in countries outside its borders, and his work is studied at universities throughout the world. He has been living in Zagreb, Croatia since he was twenty. He is married to the actress Mladena Gavran, and founded the GAVRAN Theatre with her in 2002. Their son Jakov is an actor.

The project was instigated by John Petrie at the end of the 19th century. The town of Brisbane was expanding and seeking more reliable sources of drinking water than Enoggera Dam and Gold Creek Dam could provide. Location and features The location was selected because it was just above the upstream tidal flow of seawater at Colleges Crossing. The concrete structure was completed in April 1892. The dam wall rises and is in length. The weir has a capacity of , making it one of the largest weirs in the region. Above the weir is a one-lane road which is open to the public. The nearby Mount Crosby Pumping Station is used to transport drinking water that is sourced from the weir as well as Lake Manchester Dam built shortly after the Mount Crosby Weir. Without an ongoing eradication program water hyacinth weed can choke the waters behind the weir, all the way upstream to Fernvale. In 2009 the weir was flushed to remove algai and organic matter that had built up.

The statue, by Edward Clark Potter, was designated as a Michigan Historic Site on June 15, 1992 and soon after listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 9, 1994. Background While Custer was not born in Monroe, he lived much of his early childhood there with relatives and attended the schools in Monroe. During his youth, he met his future wife Elizabeth Bacon, whom he returned to marry in 1864. Custer left Monroe to attend the United States Military Academy and fight in the Civil War. Because of his hard work and success during the war‚Äîas well as the Union's need for officers‚Äîhe was promoted to the rank of Major General and became a very well-known military figure. After the Civil War, he fought in the Indian Wars in the West. His previous accomplishments in the Civil War, however, were overshadowed by his catastrophic defeat and death at the Battle of the Little Big Horn on June 25, 1876. To honor him, a $24,000, 14-foot (4.27 m) bronze equestrian statue, sculpted by Edward Clark Potter, was unveiled in Monroe in June 1910 by President William Howard Taft and the widowed Elizabeth Bacon Custer. The statue commemorates his successful actions during the Civil War and not his more well-known defeat in 1876. Location Taft speaks to a crowd at the unveiling of the statue in 1910. Elizabeth Bacon Custer is pictured just below Taft to his right. In the century since the statue was installed, it has been placed at three different sites. It was originally located in the middle of the brick-paved intersection of First and Washington streets in front of the courthouse; this area is part of the present-day Old Village Historic District. His widow Elizabeth Custer, who spent much of her later life improving Custer's reputation and public image, argued that the statue deserved a better location. Some residents complained that it was a traffic hazard in the middle of an intersection. When the statue was first erected, traffic was sparse in Monroe, but automobile traffic was markedly increasing. On June 20, 1923, the statue was moved to a new location in Soldiers and Sailors Park along the River Raisin. There, the statue stood in relative isolation and was eventually obscured by unkempt scrubs and trees. Because of public protests, the city moved the statue to a better location in August 1955. When movers arrived to take the statue to a new location, they originally could not find it within the overgrown vegetation. The statue was moved to its current location on the southwest corner of Elm Avenue and North Monroe Street along the River Raisin. This is one of the most prominent intersections in the city, and the statue is well-lit at night. The statue is now one of the most recognizable objects in Monroe. The George Armstrong Custer Equestrian Monument is located across Elm Street from the St. Mary's Church Complex Historic District and adjacent to the East Elm-North Macomb Street Historic District. Monument The statue in its original location at Washington and First Street in 1910 The statue in its current location at the corner of Elm Street and North Monroe Street Proponents of the statue argue that it commemorates Custer's spectacular service to the Union during the Civil War and not his failure at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. The statue shows Custer wearing his Civil War uniform. In keeping with sculptural convention, his horse has all four feet on the ground, as Custer did not die during that period of service. The historical marker commemorating the statue reads: Born in New Rumley, Ohio, George A. Custer grew up in Monroe in the home of his half-sister, Mrs. David Reed. On February 9, 1864, in the Presbyterian Church here, he married Libbie Bacon, the only daughter of Judge and Mrs. Daniel S. Bacon. During the Civil War, Custer served with distinction, including at the Battle of Gettysburg. He received six brevets and was made brigadier-general before he was 26 years old, a rare distinction. From 1866 until his death at the Battle of the Little Big Horn, Custer commanded the famous Seventh Cavalry Regiment, leading them in scouting and Indian fighting throughout Kansas and the Dakota Territory. His rank at death was lieutenant colonel, as he reverted back to colonel from brigadier general at the end of the Civil War. (He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1866, at Ft Riley, Kansas.) This statue of General Custer, created by Edward C. Potter, was erected by the State of Michigan, unveiled by Mrs. Elizabeth B. Custer and dedicated by President William Howard Taft on June 4, 1910. The statue was rededicated September 3, 1955, by the members of the First Cavalry Division, of which Custer's Seventh Cavalry Regiment was a part.

It includes the seasonally- and permanently-flooded grasslands and savannas in the basin of Lake Chad in Central Africa, and covers portions of Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria. Geography Lake Chad is a large shallow lake, lying at the center of a large closed drainage basin, with no outlet to the sea. The Lake Chad basin has an area of . The northern portion of the basin is arid or semi-arid, and the southern portion has a seasonally-dry savanna climate. The flooded savannas surround the lake. The Chari and Logone rivers, which drain northwards from the highlands along the basin's southern edge, supply 95% of Lake Chad's freshwater. The Yobe River, which flows eastwards into the lake's northern end, contributes 2.5% of the lake's inflow. Accessed 7 July 2020. Despite having no outlet, Lake Chad has relatively low salinity. The saltier waters sink to the bottom of the lake, and drain northwards via underground conduits. The southern portion of the lake, which receives far more river inflow, is generally less salty than the northern portion. The ecoregion also includes the Hadejia-Nguru wetlands in northern Nigeria. These seasonal wetlands form at the confluence of the Hadejia the Jama'are rivers, part of the Yobe River system lying west of the lake. These wetlands expand to 6,000 km¬≤ during the rivers' late-August peak, with a water surface area of 2,000 km¬≤. The Lake Chad portion of the ecoregion is surrounded by the Sahelian Acacia savanna ecoregion, a belt of dry savanna which runs east and west across Africa south of the Sahara Desert. The Hadejia-Nguru wetlands are bounded by the West Sudanian savanna ecoregion. Climate The climate is tropical and dry, with 320 mm of annual rainfall on the lake. Rainfall is concentrated during the June through October rainy season. March to June is hot and dry, and the November through February winter months are dry and cooler. Evaporation exceeds precipitation during most months. Flora The lake includes areas of open water and shallow-water reed beds. Common reed bed plants in the southern lake include Cyperus papyrus, Phragmites mauritianus, and Vossia cuspidata. Phragmites australis and Typha domingensis are more common in the saltier northern lake. Nile lettuce (Pistia stratiotes) is a floating plant that occasionally forms large beds across open-water areas. Vegetation in seasonally-flooded areas varies with the depth and duration of seasonal flooding. Ya√©r√© grasslands are found in frequently- flooded areas at the southern end of the lake. Characteristic plants include Echinochloa pyramidalis, Vetiveria nigritana, Oryza longistaminata, and Hyparrhenia rufa. Where seasonal flooding is shallower and shorter duration, Trees and shrubs are present, ranging from savannas to woodlands, locally known ‚Äòkaral‚Äô or ‚Äòfirki‚Äô. Acacia seyal is the predominant tree, with Acacia nilotica around depressions. An understory of grasses and shrubs grows 2 to 3 meters high, and includes Caperonia palustris, Echinochloa colona, Hibiscus asper, Hygrophila auriculata, Sorghum purpureosericeum, and Schoenfeldia gracilis. Fauna The flooded grasslands and savannas are important habitat for water birds, including Palearctic migrants that over-winter here. The river prinia (Prinia fluviatilis) and rusty lark (Mirafra rufa) are resident birds which inhabit the Lake Chad flooded savannas and other wetlands in the Sahel. Threats The lake has shrunk considerably in recent decades, becoming much shallower and smaller in extent. Protected areas A 2017 assessment found that 14,732 km¬≤, or 46%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas.

This Adams founded the Greengates Pottery in 1779, producing fine jasperware table sets, plaques, medallions and other products stamped Adams & Co. He is said to have been a friend and confidant of Josiah Wedgwood.William Turner, William Adams, an old English potter, 1904, Chapman & Hall Biography Adams was baptised in Tunstall, Staffordshire, the son of a potter. Born after the death of his father, he was raised by his grandfather, also a potter, who, according to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, placed him as an apprentice with John Brindley (brother of James Brindley, notable as a pioneer of canals). Other sources make him a \\"favourite pupil\\" of Josiah Wedgwood. Some 300 of his works have been identified, but he is nowadays mainly known only to those with an interest in 18th century English ceramics. Adams died in 1805, and his prosperous business was taken over by his younger son Benjamin; the business closed in 1820 in part due to Benjamin's ill health and was sold in 1826 to John Meir, but in 1897 was sold back to another branch of the Adams family, and was finally absorbed into the Wedgwood Group in 1966.

He was selected as a first-team All-Southern player in 1915 and 1916 and a third-team All-American in 1916. In August 1918, while serving as a pilot in the 95th Aero Squadron during World War I, he was killed in aerial combat over France. He was described as \\"the player who has most appealed to the imagination, admiration, and affection of the entire university community through the years.\\" Early years Curry was born on August 4, 1894 in Marlin, Texas to his parents, Oscar E. Curry (1869‚Äì1964) and Emma C. (Fannin) Curry (1872‚Äì1963). He attended Marlin High School, where he was a stand-out athlete. In 1912, he was the Texas state champion in the pole vault as a junior with a then-record 10' 4\\" (3.14 m), and in 1913, he was on the Texas state champion mile-relay team with a then-state record 3:49. Vanderbilt After graduating from high school, Curry enrolled at Vanderbilt University where he became the quarterback for the school's football team from 1914 to 1916. He was nominated though not selected for an Associated Press All-Time Southeast 1869‚Äì1919 era team. Curry weighed only 130 pounds while playing football for Vanderbilt. He was an elusive runner who reportedly \\"only needed the suspicion of an opening to wriggle through, and once into the open ‚Äî zip, flash and a touchdown.\\" Curry also played center field on the baseball team and would pole vault, hurdle, and broad jump for the track team. He was a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity and the Delta Sigma Delta medical fraternity. 1915 football team As a junior in 1915, Curry led Vanderbilt to a record-setting season in which they scored 514 points in 510 minutes of actual playing time, \\"ranking them as a legitimate 'point-a-minute' team.\\" They finished 9‚Äì1‚Äì0. Following an 85-yard touchdown run in Vanderbilt's one loss, The Washington Post wrote that the \\"little Curry\\" was \\"quick as a flash\\" and \\"Vanderbilt's bright star.\\" Curry throwing a forward pass. In Vanderbilt's 1915 game against Mississippi, the team traveled by train from Nashville to Memphis, Tennessee, where the game was to be played. The players complained about the lack of food on the train, and the team's manager picked three or four hatfuls of green apples from an orchard near the tracks. The manager later recalled that Curry ate many of the green apples and proceeded to score six touchdowns and kick eight goals after touchdown against Ole Miss. The final score was 91-0. Vanderbilt's final game of the 1915 season was a Thanksgiving Day game against Sewanee. Vanderbilt won 27‚Äì3, as Curry scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns and kicked three goals from touchdown, leading The Atlanta Constitution to write: > \\"Curry was the star of the game, and proved a marvel at advancing the ball. > Near the end of the last quarter, when Clark punted, Curry received the ball > on his own 20-yard line and ran 80 yards for a touchdown. Another time he > ran 34 yards for a touchdown. Time after time Curry made 10, 15 and 20 yard > gains, and his work was largely responsible for Vanderbilt's victory.\\" 150px Sewanee coach Harris Cope said \\"I think Curry is one of the greatest players I have ever seen.\\" At the end of the 1915 season, Curry was selected as a first-team All-Southern back by all ten Southern sporting writers in a composite poll published by The Atlanta Constitution. 1916 football team In December 1915, Curry's teammates elected him captain of the 1916 Vanderbilt football team. During the 1916 football season, Curry led Vanderbilt to a 7‚Äì1‚Äì1 record. In October 1916, Curry led Vanderbilt to its first-ever victory over Virginia, and the Associated Press reported that \\"Virginia was unable to stop the fleet-footed 'Rabbit' Curry\\", whose \\"spectacular open field running was the feature of the game.\\" Curry had runs of 61, 40 and 11 yards against Virginia, scored a touchdown and kicked three goals from touchdown. At the end of the 1916 season, Curry was selected as an All-Southern quarterback and as a third-team All-American by Walter Camp for Collier's Weekly. Curry was honored as Bachelor of Ugliness. World War I Curry would have graduated with Vanderbilt's Class of 1918, but he enlisted in the military when the United States entered World War I in 1917. Curry joined the 95th Aero Squadron in the village of Saints as a pilot, attaining the rank of First Lieutenant. On August 10, 1918, while on protection patrol, he was killed in an aerial combat over Perles, France. Lieutenant Hunnicutt, who flew with Rabbit, described First Lieutenant Curry's death in a letter to his family: \\"Irby and a classmate from Vanderbilt were in the same aero squadron. At Chateau Thierry their squad engaged Richthofen's circus (Germany's greatest aero squad). Irby was wounded and went into a tight spiral and to land. He never gained strength to come out of the spiral and crashed to the earth. His classmate downed a plane and landed to get the German, but landed on German soil and was captured. Nine out of eighteen of Irby's squad were killed, The Germans suffered greater than the Americans.\\" After learning about the death of Curry, McGugin wired this telegram to The Tennessean: \\"During the four years of my intimate association with Irby Curry, I never heard him utter a word his mother might not hear and approve. A game sportsman and scholar, truly he was gentle as a dove. He had a lion's heart, and now a hero's death. Poor Little Rabbit! How he pulls at the heart-strings of all of us who knew him and therefore honored and loved him tenderly.\\" Curry was survived by his wife, Dimple Jenna Rush. Curry's remains were initially buried at Atz, France, but were subsequently removed to a military cemetery at Ch√¢teau-Thierry. In August 1921, Curry's remains were removed and reburied in a cemetery in his hometown of Marlin, Texas. Floral tributes, telegrams and tributes from hundreds of Vanderbilt alumni, athletes and officials were sent to the funeral. Posthumous honors For many years after Curry's death, Vanderbilt's football coach Dan McGugin had three photographs displayed over his desk. The three pictures were of Abraham Lincoln, Robert E. Lee and Curry. When McGugin took the Vanderbilt team on the road against Texas in 1921, he took the team to Curry's grave in Marlin, Texas before the game. Before the team ran onto the field against Texas, McGugin told them: \\"They are betting Texas will beat you 20 to 0, they say you are a bunch of cowards. 'Rabbit' Curry, whose father is sitting here with you, is looking down on you from his Eternal Home.\\" Vanderbilt won the game 20‚Äì0. In 1930, a newspaper account reported on the special place that Curry maintained in McGugin's memory: > \\"Uncle Dan may have had better players than Curry, but the Rabbit somehow > wound himself more closely into the affections of the old master than any > other Black and Gold athlete. It was one of those reciprocal admirations of > a big man for a little man.

It was designed to be compatible with four different railway electrification systems (different voltages in the overhead lines),Haydock, David (June-July 1996). \\"The Second Demise of the TEE\\".

Like all TEE trains, the RAe TEE II trainsets were equipped with first-class accommodation only. A total of five trainsets were built, numbered 1051‚Äì1055.  Operation  Preserved and restored RAe TEE II trainset number 1053 on a 2003 excursion An RABe EC in Bern, after being taken out of TEE service (in 1988), converted to two-class and repainted grey. Although no longer a TEE, it still has its TEE badge on the front. These trains were originally used on the following services: * TEE Gottardo, Z√ºrich ‚Äì Milano * TEE Cisalpin, Milano ‚Äì Paris * TEE Ticino, Milano ‚Äì Z√ºrich The trains ran in a 4-day circulation: # Gottardo, Z√ºrich ‚Äì Milano, and Cisalpin, Milano ‚Äì Paris # Cisalpin, Paris ‚Äì Milano # Ticino, Milano ‚Äì Z√ºrich ‚Äì Milano, and Gottardo, Milano ‚Äì Z√ºrich # layover in Zurich From 30 May 1965, the southbound Gottardo started from Basel, but nevertheless the northbound train still terminated in Z√ºrich. This led to an empty run (every fourth day for any given trainset) from Z√ºrich to Basel. From 30 September 1979, this section was only served on weekdays, and on 23 May 1982 it was withdrawn entirely. During the summers of 1974‚Äì1979 the Gottardo was extended from Milano to Genova (in both directions). The Cisalpin was converted in 1974 to a locomotive-hauled train and the Ticino was discontinued, freeing up RAe sets for the following two TEE trains:\\"Summer services, 1974\\" (changes due to take effect).

After their use on TEE services ended, the RAe TEE II sets were converted to two-class trains, redesignated type RABe EC, repainted from red-and-cream to two-tone grey, and put into use on EuroCity services from Z√ºrich to Milano (the EC Gottardo), Z√ºrich to Stuttgart, and Lausanne to Milano (the EC Lemano and EC Lutetia). Their new livery earned them the nickname \\"grey mouse\\". They were removed from EuroCity service in 1994 and retired from regular service altogether in late 1999.

Legal career  After graduating law school, Chen served judicial clerkships for United States District Judge Charles Byron Renfrew from June 1979 until April 1980 and United States Circuit Judge James R. Browning from June 1981 until June 1982. From 1982 until 1985, Chen served as an associate at the San Francisco law firm of Coblentz, Cahen, McCabe & Breyer. In September 1985, Chen became a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, specializing in language discrimination cases. He held that post until April 2001, when the judges on the United States District Court for the Northern District of California named Chen to an eight-year term as a United States Magistrate Judge.  Federal judicial service   United States magistrate judge service  Chen served as a United States Magistrate Judge from 2001 until 2011.

He is best known for his work in rehabilitation following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and other forms of acquired neurological impairment. His two major contribution to TBI rehabilitation are the Neurofunctional Approach to brain injury rehabilitation (with J. Clark-Wilson) and non-aversive treatment of persons with neurobehavioral disability and behaviour disorder (sometimes referred to as relational therapy).Giles, G. M., & Manchester, D. (2006). Two approaches to behavior disorder after traumatic brain injury. Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation, 21(2), 168‚Äì178. Education and early career Giles received his undergraduate degree from the University of Warwick, UK and his PhD from the California School of Professional Psychology, USA. He was trained in rehabilitation of persons with TBI in the early 1980s at the Kemsley Unit of St Andrew's Hospital, UK. The Kemsley unit was the first program to use applied behavioural analysis principles to rehabilitation of persons with behaviour disorder after TBI, and his publications from this period are straightforward applications of behavioural methods to TBI.Giles, G. M., & Clark-Wilson, J. (1988). The use of behavioral techniques in functional skills training after severe brain injury. The American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 42, 658‚Äì665.Giles, G. M., & Shore, M. (1989). A rapid method for teaching severely brain-injured adults to wash and dress. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 70, 156‚Äì158. Noteworthy however is the first application of errorless learning principles to this population (though the term errorless learning was not used).Giles, G. M., & Clark-Wilson, J. (1988). The use of behavioral techniques in functional skills training after severe brain injury. The American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 42, 658‚Äì665. Neurofunctional approach A full description of the Neurofunctional approach was published in 1993.Giles, G. M., & Clark-Wilson, J. (Eds.). (1993). Brain injury rehabilitation: A neurofunctional approach. San Diego: Singular. Although highly influenced by applied behavioural analysis, it incorporates social learning principles and considers the social and emotional consequences of the injury in rehabilitation. The Neurofunctional approach is designed for individuals who are unlikely to develop self-care or community independence skills spontaneously. Treatment focuses on \\"learning by doing.\\" In the Neurofunctional approach this \\"doing\\" is structured using an errorless learning approach and repetition to develop \\"internalized performance models\\" intended to automatically guide future performance. Practice of the actual task in a prescribed format is intended to reduce the executive demands of the activity. Practiced tasks are expected to improve, and as the individual develops competencies there may be effects on his or her goal-states and self- esteem that will further enhance performance (i.e., a bottom-up approach).Giles, G. M., Ridley, J., Dill, A., & Frye, S. (1997). A consecutive series of brain injured adults treated with a washing and dressing retraining program.

Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 89, 2227‚Äì2238. indicated that the Neurofunctional approach is as effective as an established form of cognitive rehabilitation when added to standard care in assisting individuals with TBI achieve return to work/school or independent living. Additionally, small scale studies of the Neurofunctional approach have suggested that it is the only approach demonstrated to improve functional skills in persons many years post TBI.Giles, G. M., Ridley, J., Dill, A., & Frye, S. (1997). A consecutive series of brain injured adults treated with a washing and dressing retraining program. American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 51, 256‚Äì266.Parish, L., & Oddy, M. (2007). Efficacy of rehabilitation for functional skills more than 10 years after extremely severe brain injury. Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 17(2), 230‚Äì243. In the professional language of occupational therapists the Neurofunctional Approach is described as a frame of reference, and an occupation based approach. Applied behaviour analysis More recently, Gordon Muir Giles has been reporting on interventions for persons with acquired neurological impairments and behaviour disorder. Beginning in the 1980s applied behaviour analysis principles were introduced for use with persons with TBI. By the late 1990s however it was recognised that up to a third of persons with TBI and behaviour disorder were unable to make use of standard behavioural interventions.Eames, P. (1992). Hysteria following brain injury. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry, 55, 1046‚Äì1053.Eames, P., Cotterill, G., Kneale, T. A., Storrar, A. L., & Yeomans, P. (1995). Outcome of intensive rehabilitation after severe brain injury. Brain Injury, 10(9), 631‚Äì650.Giles & Manchester, 2006 Non-aversive approaches to behaviour disorder after TBI are consistent with concepts in psychiatric rehabilitation and positive behavioural supports in work with persons with mental retardation but were developed independently from them. The interventions stress a philosophy of normalisation, respect, non- confrontation, positive engagement, support, and functional and behavioural skill development. The approach is based on the observation that much of the behavioural disregulation is hostile/irritable aggression and not instrumental in nature. The interventions attempt to reduce environmental stressors and instigations to aggression and to use inclusion and positive engagement to reduce the frequency of aggressive behaviour. Evidence is currently limited to small-scale proof of concept designs and the approaches have not been subjected to randomised controlled investigations.Giles, G. M., Wager, J., Fong, L., & Waraich, B. S. (2005). Twenty-month effectiveness of a non- aversive, long-term, low cost programme for persons with persisting neurobehavioural disability.

It also advocates for social justice of all human beings in Puerto Rico. Since 2003, as executive director of Puerto Rico Para Tod@s, Serrano has maintained an active online presence.  Activism   Speaker  Serrano has given speeches and conferences in Puerto Rico in several campuses of the \\"Universidad de Puerto Rico\\" and the \\"Universidad Interamericana\\", \\"Universidad del Sagrado Coraz√≥n\\" and \\"Pontifica Universidad Cat√≥lica de Puerto Rico\\", as well as \\"Universidad del Turabo and Universidad del Este\\". He has also given conferences at the Universities of Yale, Brown, Syracuse, Swarthmore, UConn, Mount Holyoke College, Hostos Community College and the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College. He has also been the keynote speaker at various conferences such as the 9th LLEGO meeting ‚Äì the National Organization for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Latinos/as, in the Second Educational Day Against Homophobia and the Third Colloquium \\"Del otro la'o?\\"(From the other side): Perspectives on queer sexualities. Serrano has advocated against hate crimes, denouncing and demanding the investigation of possible crimes motivated by prejudice against sexual orientation and/or gender identity. He led a historic visit of elected officials from New York and Illinois who visited Puerto Rico in solidarity with the fight against hate crimes against LGBT people.  Campaigns  Also in 2010, thanks to a campaign initiated and led by Serrano, the #1 Puerto Rican television program, SuperXclusivo, publicly apologized to LGBTT communities and people living with HIV, for using derogatory language against him. As a result, the television station, WAPA TV, also released \\"In WAPA we Respect Diversity\\", a historical public service campaign to educate on the use of offensive language, eliminate discrimination and respect diversity.  LGBT Pride Parade in Boquer√≥n  In mid-2014, with just one month to prepare, Serrano and his organization \\"Puerto Rico Para Tod@s\\" took charge of the LGBTT Pride Parade of Boquer√≥n. Together with his brother H√©ctor and his company M√∫jica Group, he produced the busiest parade in the history of Puerto Rico with more than 40 thousand people in attendance, according to police and media.  Boycott SuperXclusivo (La Comay)  In late 2012 and early 2013, Serrano was one of the leaders and spokespeople of the Boycott to La Comay, a movement of people who managed to bring together more than 80,000 people who managed the cancellation of SuperXclusivo a program of WAPA TV due to its homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, classism, racism and other forms of intolerance, as well as the attack on the individual and collective dignity of the Puerto Rican people. In 2020 Serrano called for another boycott of \\"La Comay\\" after new comments made by the host which where considered racist.  LGBT laws in Puerto Rico  In early 2013, he worked directly with Senator Ram√≥n Luis Nieves in the establishment of the Senate Project 238 to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment. Also, he collaborated with Representative Luis Vega Ramos in the filing of House Bill 488 to include sexual orientation, marital status and gender identity in the protections of Law 54 that regulate domestic violence. These projects became Law 22 and Law 23 of 2013 when Gov. Alejandro Garc√≠a Padilla signed them at a ceremony at La Fortaleza with several guests, which included Serrano. After meeting with the Secretary of Labor, Vance Thomas and Arturo Rios, the advisor of Labor Affairs of Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla, an executive order was issued to give the benefit medical plan to cohabiting couples. Later, two bills gave that right to LGBT couples in the public and private sector. Also, Serrano was instrumental in pushing the administration to issue an executive order to allow transgender people to change their sex markers on driver's licenses. In 2020 he expressed his opposition to changes in the civil code which would create issues related to the sex change in the documents of transgender people.  Marriage equality in Puerto Rico  Under the leadership of Serrano, his organization \\"Puerto Rico Para Tod@s\\" joined as a co-plaintiff in the federal lawsuit filed by Ada Conde and Ivonne Alvarez to achieve the right to marry for LGBT people in Puerto Rico. In an effort led by Lambda Legal, four couples and \\"Puerto Rico Para Tod@s\\" joined the lawsuit in June 2014. Marriage equality became a reality in the United States in June 2015 and in Puerto Rico it was reaffirmed by a decision from the federal appeals court in July of that same year.  Puerto Rican Day Parade and Pulse shooting  Pedro Julio Serrano was announced as one of the key honorees of the Puerto Rican Day Parade in 2016, where he was named \\"Orgullo Puertorrique√±o\\" or Puerto Rican Pride, the same title that Lin-Manuel Miranda received the prior year. His advocacy led the National Puerto Rican Day Parade to dedicate its 2016 parade to the LGBT struggle to celebrate the win of marriage equality and to honor the contributions of LGBT Puerto Ricans. The Pulse nightclub shooting, in which a shooter killed 49 people and wounded 53 more at a gay bar in Orlando, Florida, occurred the same day that Serrano was honored at the National Puerto Rican Day Parade. Serrano travelled the next day to Orlando. There, he met with survivors, with grieving families, and with authorities. He did more than 100 interviews with local, state, national and international outlets. He visited with 14 of the 23 families of the Puerto Ricans that were killed and 11 of the survivors. His advocacy was recognized by the Puerto Rican musician Ricky Martin. He stated in July 2016 that Puerto Rico was still mourning its victims.  Awards and recognitions  Serrano has received numerous awards for his struggle for social justice and for the rights of the Puerto Rican and Latino LGBTT communities. At his high school graduation in 1992, he won the \\"Sister Sheila O'Brien Award\\", the highest honor given at his school, for his outstanding contribution to the community. He also received the Leadership Award from the Rotary Club of Isla Verde. In 2000, he was awarded with the Solidarity Award as Male Activist of the Year from the Healing Christ Church. In 2003, he was recognized as one of the most outstanding LGBTT activists in Puerto Rico by OrgulloBoricua. In 2004, he was recognized as one of Top 10 LGBT activists in Latino community by Ambiente. In 2005, he was recognized as one of five most outstanding LGBT activists by Tentaciones. In 2007, he received the Pride Award by the PRIDE organization in New York City. In 2009, he received the Bronze Star, Silver Star and the Bravo Award by public acclamation at the LGBTT Pride Parade in Boquer√≥n. He was also the grand marshal of the 7th. LGBTT Pride Parade of the West in Boquer√≥n, Puerto Rico. In addition, in the same year was he was chosen by MyLatinoVoice.com as one of the 25 most influential LGBT Latin@s. In 2010, he was named one of the 5 most promising Puerto Ricans in New York by the newspaper AM New York. In 2010, Serrano received the Puerto Rican Pride Award ‚Äì through a video ‚Äì by the Puerto Rican superstar Ricky Martin. This prize is awarded by Comit√© Noviembre, an organization that brings together the most important and recognized boricuas institutions of New York City to extol the identity of the Puerto Ricans in recognition of the immense social, cultural, political and artistic contributions of the Puerto Rican community in the United States. In 2011, he received the annual award of the Queens Lesbian and Gay Pride Committee and dedicated the prize to a young Puerto Rican 13 years old boy who is openly gay and founded a support group at a school for kids. Serrano was also recognized as \\"Outstanding Insurgent\\" during the 9th. Colloquium \\"Ni Una Vida M√°s Para La Toga de la Facultad de Derecho Eugenio Mar√≠a de Hostos\\" at Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. That same year, Pedro Julio and his family, including his parents and his brothers, were awarded the Pride Award for \\"exemplary family\\". In New York City for LGBT Pride Month in 2011, Serrano was recognized by the Bronx Pride Community Center, Boogie Down Pride and BrainPower with the LGBTQ Pride Award and Allies in the Bronx. In addition, the Manhattan Borough President, Scott Stringer, recognized him with a proclamation declaring June 23, 2011 as the \\"Pedro Julio Serrano Day at the Manhattan Borough\\" at the annual celebration of LGBT Pride. Also, El Diario/La Prensa ‚Äì the second largest Spanish-language newspaper largest circulation in the US ‚Äì recognized him with \\"EL\\" Award, which honors the most influential and prominent Latinos in New York. In addition, in 2011, he was recognized as one of the Ten Outstanding Young People of Puerto Rico in 2011 by the Junior Chamber International of Puerto Rico. This recognition is historic because it is the first time they picked a young openly gay man to receive such a distinction. The Latino Queens LGBT community, through Jessenia Marie Rosa, gave a recognition to Serrano as the leading activist at the Paparazzi Awards in New York City. In 2012, he was also recognized as one of the most influential Latino activist by the Huffington Post. He was also named Honorary Trans America by the TransLatinasNYC group for their solidarity with the trans community in New York City. At the end of 2012, he was named one of the main protagonists of 2012 by the magazine Caras in a collector's edition that recognizes the most outstanding figures of the year in Puerto Rico. In early 2013, it was also chosen in the Top Ten LGBT activists in Puerto Rico by Primera Hora and was on top of that list. \\"Pedro Julio is characterized by his elegance and for using simple, clear language. He's the most consistent in their mission\\", read the description of Serrano's activism. In mid-2013, he was awarded the Dennis DeLeon Voice Commitment Award at the Cielo Latino Gala of the Latino Commission on AIDS for his tireless advocacy for the rights of the LGBT community and people living with HIV. In late 2013, Serrano was named as one of the 20 Latin@s Trailblazers of the Year by Being Latino ‚Äì one of the most important social networks of the Latino community in the US. In addition, after eight years in New York City, he returned for a year to his homeland to continue the fight. In early 2014, Serrano was recognized as one of the rising stars by the Hispanic Latino Coalition. This recognition is given to 40 leaders under 40 who have excelled in various areas in the Latino community. Serrano was one of the key honorees of the National Puerto Rican Day Parade, where he was named \\"Orgullo Puertorrique√±o\\" or Puerto Rican Pride. In December, the University Gardens High School dedicated its Puerto Rican celebration to Serrano for his activism in creating a more just society. Also, in late 2016, Serrano was a keynote speaker and the recipient of the special recognition at the Puerto Rican Leadership Summit in Orlando, Florida, and was named as one of the 11 most prominent LGBT Latin@s by NBC Latino.  New York City Council  Serrano served, from 2015 to 2016, as senior advisor to the Speaker of New York City Council, Melissa Mark Viverito. He oversaw the scheduling and advance department, as well as has LGBT rights, Puerto Rico and Latino issues under his portfolio.  Living in Puerto Rico  After 10 years living in New York City, Serrano moved back to his homeland in June 2016. He is the Executive Director of Puerto Rico Para Tod@s.

Turning the Corner has plans set out to reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions by 20% relative to 2006 levels by 2020, and reductions of 60 to 70 percent below 2006 levels by 2050.http://www.ec.gc.ca/doc/virage-corner/2008-03/541_eng.htm#introduction Plan Emissions intensity The plan which mainly starts in 2010 uses intensity based targets for industry, which will start in 2010. All covered industrial sectors will be required to reduce their emissions intensity from 2006 levels by 18% by 2010, with 2% continuous improvement every year after that. Components of the plan The main components of the action plan are as follows * a regulatory framework for industrial emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants; * the development of a mandatory fuel-efficiency standard for automobiles, beginning with the 2011 model year, as well as action to reduce emissions from the rail, marine, and aviation sectors, and from on-road and off-road vehicles and engines; * the implementation of new energy performance standards to strengthen existing energy-efficiency standards for a number of products that consume electricity, including light bulbs, in order to reduce emissions from the use of consumer and commercial products; and * the development of measures to improve indoor air quality. Criticism The Turning the Corner action plan has received a large amount of criticism from many environmental groups and opposition political parties, because it fails to meet Canada's Kyoto Protocol targets. It has also been criticized for having weak goals and some say that the use of Emissions Intensity targets will in the long run allow emissions to increase.http://alberta.pembina.org/op-ed/1661 Provincial plans Despite the fact that the federal government released a national emissions reduction plan most provinces have set out their own goals for 2020. Ontario has a goal of 15% below 1990 levels by 2020, Quebec has a goal of 20% below 1990 levels by 2020, and British Columbia has a plan that will reduce its emissions 33% below 2007 levels by 2020, other provinces have goals however they are similar to the federal goals. Alberta is the only province that has a plan that will let emissions rise until 2020 at which time Alberta's emissions will begin to decrease to 14% below the provinces 2005 levels by 2050. Climate policy changes After the 2008 Federal Election, Jim Prentice took over as Minister of the Environment replacing John Baird. There have not been many new developments in climate change policy since Baird initially released the plan. However in December 2009 Jim Prentice announced that Canada would not be using intensity based targets, and that Canada would use absolute targets, something many critics have wanted, this will ensure that emissions get reduced.

It produced a small library of treatises underscoring the stylistic aspects of writing history as a work of art, but also introducing the contributions of philology and textual criticism in its precepts and evaluations. Background At the summit of his ars oratoria Cicero had celebrated history as the magistra vitae. In his De Oratore he proposed history as the summit of ars rhetorica, the rhetorical culture in which eloquence is at the service of the truth of human experience. Within the context of the rhetorical culture of humanism, the ars historica was an attempt to introduce critical and scholarly criteria into historical literature. Its significance was great during the period of confessional struggle between Protestants and Catholics in the later sixteenth century. In addition to the examples of the classical historians (Herodotus and Thucydides, Livy and Tacitus), the contemporary works of Machiavelli and Guicciardini enhanced the prestige of historical writing. Two further Greek writers were classical sources for the ars historica: Lucian of Samosata and Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Sixteenth century The attempt to raise history to the status of a classical ars derived impetus from the mid-century critical renewal brought about by the Ars Poetica of Aristotle. The text of Aristotle's Poetics was an inspiration in Italy, renewing the critical discourse about literature. Francis Robortello, known as the father of hermeneutics and an Aristotelian exponent, also wrote the first treatise De arte historica in 1548. Francesco Patrizi wrote ten dialogues on history in 1560. In 1566 Jean Bodin published his Methodus ad facilem historiarum cognitionem, a seminal work. Using the critical apparatus of humanist historiography Bodin reviews and evaluates the classical and contemporary bibliography of historical writing. The idea of method was also a leading systematic concept of the era, expanding the scope of the classical ars.Neal W. Gilbert,(1960) Renaissance Concepts of Method, New York, Columbia UP. Bodin's Methodus reflects the search for new historical principles based on intellectual reform of textual criticism. Such an attempt speaks for the elevation of history as a pre- scientific organizing principle for the contemporary encyclopedia and its bibliography. Perna printer's device & motto: Verbum tuum lucerna pedibus meis The vogue of the genre was international, stretching beyond the Italy of Robortello, Patrizi and their followers and the France of Bodin to the Basel humanists (Simon Grynaeus and Theodor Zwinger. Further it reached Protestant historians such David Chytraeus, Flanders (Francois Baudouin), Spain (Sebastian Fox Morcillo) and as far as England (Thomas Blundeville). In Basel Pietro Perna distinguished himself as a promoter of a new cultural and religious model rooted in Erasmian critical standards in religion and medicine but also in historical scholarship. As a historical printer he is best known for his illustrated editions of Paolo Giovio, but also for editions of standard and contemporary works, including Protestant chronicles and histories. Perna brought together all the major authors and works of the ars historica in two compilations. The Methodus historica (1576) featured Bodin followed by another dozen titles. The Artis Historicae Penus (1579) adds another five titles for a total of 18 works. Subsequently, Perna's work served the Jesuit Antonio Possevino for his critique of Bodin [1592] and as the target and textual source for his Apparatus ad omnium gentium historiam (1597). It plagiarizes Bodin, but also updates his bibliography (Lipsius, Baronio, Carolus Sigonius, Tasso) and censures works on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Seventeenth century In the century that followed, interest in the rhetoric of the genre continued, though its intellectual content was exhausted. The literary focus of Agostino Mascardi's Dell‚Äôarte historica reflects the intellectual demotion of the magistra vitae concepts with the advent of Cartesian and scientific rationalism.Girolamo Cotroneo (1971) I trattatisti dell'Ars Historica, Naples, Giannini. Gerardus Vossius published a work in 1623 by this title that had subsequent editions, including the one pictured above from 1653. Degory Wheare's Oxford contribution, De ratione et methodo legendi historias, also appeared in 1623. Notes References *Peter G.

It consists of the single order Wallemiales, containing the single family Wallemiaceae, which in turn contains the single genus Wallemia. The phylogenetic origin of the lineage was placed to various parts of Basidiomycota, but according to the analysis of a larger dataset it is a sister group of Agaricomycotina. The genus contains species of xerophilic molds that are found worldwide. The seven described species (W. sebi, W. ichthyophaga, W. muriae, W. mellicola, W. canadensis, W. tropicalis, and W. hederae) are distinguished by conidial size, xerotolerance, halotolerance, chaotolerance, growth temperature regimes, extracellular enzyme activity profiles, and secondary metabolite patterns. They are typically isolated from low-moisture foods (such as cakes, bread, sugar, peanuts, dried fish), indoor air dust, salterns and soil. W. sebi is thought to be one of the causes of the hypersensitivity pneumonitis known as the farmer's lung disease, but since the other species were recognised and separated from W. sebi only recently, their role in the disease cannot be excluded. Tolerance to low water activity is generally much more frequent among ascomycetous than basidomycetous fungi, and xerotolerant fungi are also able to grow in regular growth media with normal water activity (unlike, for example, halophilic Archaea). However, species from the genus Wallemia are an exception to both of these rules: all species can tolerate high concentrations of sugars and salts (W. ichthyophaga grows even in media saturated with sodium chloride), while W. muriae and W. ichthyophaga cannot be cultivated unless the water activity of the medium is lowered. Studies on Wallemia sebi showed that it produces numerous secondary metabolic compounds, including walleminol, walleminone, wallemia A and C, and azasteroid UCA1064-B. A comprehensive research on other species of the class discovered that secondary metabolites are consistently produced by Wallemiomycetes and their production is ‚Äì contrary to common presumptions ‚Äì increased as a response to increasing NaCl concentration. In particular an increase in NaCl concentration from 5% to 15% in the growth media increased the production of the toxic metabolites wallimidione, walleminol and walleminone. Cell wall and morphological changes of Wallemia species are thought to play a major role in adaptation to low water activity. The whole genome sequences of W. sebi and W. ichthyophaga are available.

Today he is most famous for his ' waltz, which became popular as Sportpalastwalzer in 1920s Berlin.  Biography  Siegfried Translateur was born in Carlsruhe in Upper Silesia,gov.genealogy.net in the Province of Silesia, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire (Pok√≥j in Poland), the natural son of Rosaline Translateurgeni.com (1858 in Lublin, Lublin Governorate, Congress Poland, Russian Empire 1934, Moravsk√Ω Krumlov) and an unknown father, and adopted child of her later husband, the ·∏•azzƒÅn Salomon Lagodzinsky (1857, [?] 1915). He started his music studies in Breslau, Vienna, and Leipzig, and also learned from a French composer of dance music, √âmile Waldteufel. In 1900, he moved to Berlin, where he became an orchestra conductor. Translateur's entertainment music became increasingly popular; his orchestra played on international tours and even in the presence of Emperor Wilhelm II. In 1911, he founded the \\"Lyra\\" music publishing company in Berlin- Wilmersdorf. It mostly published his own works, but also compositions by Jos√© Arm√°ndola, Marc Roland, Franz von Blon and Paul Lincke, among others. Translateur's son Hans Translateurgeni.com, , later joined his father in the business, and the publishing house was renamed to \\"Lyra Translateur & Co\\". After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Translateur, having been deemed a \\"half-Jew\\" (Mischling) by the Nuremberg Laws, was forced to liquidate \\"Lyra\\", and was barred from the Reich Music Chamber which meant a professional ban. He sold his publishing house to the London publisher Bosworth in 1938. Not much is known about what happened to him after that. Translateur, along with his wife, was deported from Berlin to the Theresienstadt concentration camp on 19 April 1943. He died there on March 1, 1944, at the age of sixty-eight.  Works  Author of about 200 works, Translateur's most famous piece remains the Wiener Praterleben waltz (opus 12), which he wrote in 1892 at the age of seventeen while attending the Vienna conservatory. It became widely known as the Sportpalastwalzer (\\"Sports Palace Waltz\\"), because it has been played regularly during the \\"Six-days\\" cycle races at the Berlin Sportpalast from 1923 onwards. Up to today, it is played at the current Velodrom track cycling arena. Many of his works were titled in reference to a current event, such as the German warrior quadrille for piano, opus 45, and Automotive march for orchestra, Op 154.

History The redoubt was built by Confederate forces in 1863. Part of a 13-mile long line of defenses around the city, it originally was unnamed (other than a single letter to differentiate from other positions on the line), but was renamed for Major General William H.T. Walker after he was killed during the Battle of Atlanta. After Grant Park was established in the 1880s, a granite pedestal, a collection of four cannon, and two bronze lions commemorated the site of the fort. After years of vandalism by park visitors, the cannon were removed in the late 1980s, and one was stolen. The pair of bronze lions also went missing. Today, only a state historic marker remains. It reads: > Southeastern salient of Atlanta's inner line of fortifications erected > during the Summer & Fall of 1863. The line consisted of a cordon of redoubts > on hills connected by rifle pits encircling the city, aggregating some 10.5 > miles of earthworks designed & supervised by Col. L. P. Grant, pioneer > citizen, construction engineer & railroad builder of Atlanta. > After 93 years, it is one of a few remnants of a line that withstood the > quartering steel & climbing fire of Federal armies forty-two days -- > evacuated only when the remaining R.R. was cut. In 1938, the Atlanta Ladies Memorial Association dedicated a small monument in commemoration of the Battle of Atlanta and the significance of Fort Walker as the last remaining breastworks in the city. In late 2014, the monument was rededicated with a replacement granite cannon and a new plaque given by the Georgia Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.

Old Book of Tang, vol. 17, part 2.), courtesy name Qingchen (), was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, serving briefly as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Wenzong. He was most known for planning with Emperor Wenzong to eliminate the power of the eunuchs from the court but then being falsely implicated in a plot to overthrow Emperor Wenzong and replace the emperor with Emperor Wenzong's brother Li Cou the Prince of Zhang. As a result, Song was exiled and died in exile.  Background  It is not known when Song Shenxi was born,Old Book of Tang, vol. 167. and, while his family was listed as \\"the Songs of Guangping\\" (Âª£Âπ≥, in modern Handan, Hebei) in the table of the chancellors' family trees in the New Book of Tang, Song's biography in the New Book of Tang indicated that his family's origin had been lost to history.New Book of Tang, vol. 152. It is known that his grandfather was named Song Su () and that his father was named Song Shuye ().  Early career  Song Shenxi was said to have lost his father early in life and was poor, but capable in literature. After he passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi (ÈÄ≤Â£´) class, he was made a copyeditor (Ê†°Êõ∏ÈÉé, Xiaoshu Lang) at the Palace Library. When the chancellor Wei Guanzhi lost the favor of Emperor Xianzong and was sent out of the capital Chang'an to serve as the governor of Hunan Circuit (ÊπñÂçó, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan) in 816 for his opposition to the wars that Emperor Xianzong was waging against warlords,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 239. he invited Song to serve as a secretary, and it was said that thereafter Song successively served under regional governors.  During Emperor Muzong's and Emperor Jingzong's reigns  Early in the Changqing era (821-824) of Emperor Xianzong's son Emperor Muzong, Song Shenxi was made Jiancha Yushi (), a low-level imperial censor. In 822, he was made an imperial chronicler (Ëµ∑Â±ÖËàç‰∫∫, Qiju Sheren). In 826, by which time Emperor Muzong's son Emperor Jingzong was emperor, he was made Libu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®, Libu), and was soon given the additional title as an assistant imperial scholar (Áø∞Êûó‰æçË¨õÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Shijiang Xueshi). It was said that Song was careful and nonpartisan in his actions, contrary to the partisanship that was rampant among the imperial officials at the time, and that it was thought that his promotions would encourage others to follow his example.  During Emperor Wenzong's reign  After Emperor Jingzong was assassinated around the new year 827 and was succeeded by his younger brother Emperor Wenzong,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 243. Song Shenxi was made Hubu Langzhong (), a supervisory official at the ministry of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®, Hubu), and was also put in charge of drafting edicts. In 828, he was made Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng), as well as full imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi). At that time, Emperor Wenzong feared the power the eunuchs held, particularly as he believed them to be responsible for the deaths of his grandfather Emperor Xianzong and brother Emperor Jingzong. At that time, Wang Shoucheng was particularly powerful due to his command of the imperial Shence Army (), and his associate Zheng Zhu was openly accepting bribes in exchange for official commissions, drawing much displeasure from Emperor Wenzong. Emperor Wenzong believed Song to be faithful and careful, and believed he could discuss this matter with Song. On one occasion when Song had a private audience with Emperor Wenzong, Emperor Wenzong discussed the matter of Wang, and told Song to try to form a group of imperial officials who could work together on removing Wang from power, promising to make him chancellor. Soon thereafter in 830, Song was made Shangshu Zuo Cheng (), one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng), and then was made a chancellor de facto with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 244. It was said that because of Song's reputation, there was much public expectation for him as a chancellor, but he was not actually all that capable in his acts. As part of Emperor Wenzong's and Song's plans to eliminate the eunuchs' power, in 831, Song recommended Wang Fan () to be the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, i.e., the Chang'an region) and secretly informed Wang Fan of Emperor Wenzong's plans. However, Wang Fan then leaked it, and Wang Shoucheng and Zheng became aware of it. In response, Zheng had the Shence Army officer Doulu Zhuo () falsely accuse Song and Emperor Wenzong's brother Li Cou the Prince of Zhang of plotting to overthrow Emperor Wenzong and replace him with Li Cou. When Wang Shoucheng then reported Doulu's accusations to Emperor Wenzong, Emperor Wenzong was shocked and believed it to be true, and immediately ordered investigations. Wang Shoucheng wanted to send Shence Army soldiers to immediately slaughter Song's household, but at the urging of the eunuch Ma Cunliang (), this immediate slaughter was not carried out. Rather, Emperor Wenzong ordered that the chancellors immediately be summoned. When the chancellors ‚Äî Song, Lu Sui, Li Zongmin, and Niu Sengru ‚Äî arrived at the palace gate, a eunuch announced, \\"Song Shenxi is not summoned!\\" Song realized that he was being accused of a crime, and, after knocking his writing board on his head, withdrew back to his household to await punishment. When he arrived at his mansion, his wife asked him, \\"You, Lord, are a chancellor, the pinnacle of what a subject can reach. Why do you wrong the Son of Heaven and rebel?\\" He responded, \\"My entire life I have received the emperor's grace, and I was promoted to be chancellor. I could not remove the wicked, and was instead accused by them. You, Lady, should know that I, Song Shenxi, am no rebel.\\" They wept together. Meanwhile, the other chancellors entered Yanying Hall (), where Emperor Wenzong showed them Wang Shoucheng's report. The chancellors, shocked, stood there without words. Meanwhile, Emperor Wenzong ordered Wang Shoucheng to arrest the other alleged plotters listed by Doulu's accusation ‚Äî Li Cou's eunuch Yan Jingze () and Song's attendant Wang Shiwen (), for interrogation inside the palace. Yan was arrested, but Wang Shiwen initially fled. Two days later, Song was demoted to be a staff member of the crown prince.However, as there was no crown prince at the time, the title was entirely honorary. No one dared to openly state that Song was falsely accused, although the mayor of Jingzhao, Cui Guan (), and the chief judge of the supreme court Wang Zhengya () both submitted petitions that the arrested individuals be transferred to the jurisdiction of the proper governmental authorities rather than be held inside the palace ‚Äî and it was said that it was because of this that the situation did not escalate. Meanwhile, under interrogation, Yan stated that Song had sent Wang Shiwen to meet with Li Cou to form the plot. Two days later, Emperor Wenzong summoned the senior officials, including the heads of the various key agencies of the imperial government, to inquire them as to what they opined. A number of advisory officials, including Cui Xuanliang (), Li Guyan, Wang Zhi (), Lu Jun (), Shu Yuanbao (), Jiang Xi (), Pei Xiu (), and Wei Wen (), begged Emperor Wenzong to reopen the discussions with chancellors and move the entire investigations to the proper governmental authorities. Emperor Wenzong told them that he had already discussed with the high level officials and ordered them to withdraw. Cui bowed and wept, stating, \\"One should be careful even when executing a commoner, and even more care should be paid when killing a chancellor.\\" Emperor Wenzong's anger somewhat subsided, and he summoned the chancellors again. Niu then stated, \\"The highest that a subject can reach is chancellor, and Song Shenxi is already a chancellor. If the accusations were true, he could still only be chancellor, and why would he pursue that? Surely that was not what he was planning.\\" Meanwhile, Zheng, fearing that the officials would win out and that a second round of investigations would show the truth, suggested to Wang Shoucheng that no executions be carried out, and instead Song should be exiled. The next day, Li Cou was demoted in title to be the Duke of Chao County, while Song was exiled to be the military advisor to the prefect of Kai Prefecture (ÈñãÂ∑û, in modern Chongqing). It was said that Song, while chancellor, was refusing bribes from all around the empire, and when his mansion was seized and searched, all that were found were documents relating to his receiving and rejecting the bribes that were sent to him, and there was much mourning over his exile. Song would never be allowed to return to Chang'an while alive, and he died in 833 while still serving as Kai Prefecture. Emperor Wenzong ordered that his body be allowed to be returned to Chang'an for burial. In 836 ‚Äî after a plot that Emperor Wenzong had with Zheng Zhu (who had, by that point, turned against the eunuchs) and Li Xun to slaughter the eunuchs (known as the Ganlu Incident) failed, leading to Zheng's and Li Xun's deaths ‚Äî Song's reputation and offices were posthumously restored, and he was given further posthumous honors. His son Song Shenwei () was made a county sheriff.  Family  According to New Book of Tang, volume 75, Song Shenwei was the second son of Shenxi. The eldest son of Shenxi was named Song Qiu () and had a son named Song Xuan () with the courtesy name Taowen ().

MLB 2K10 was available for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Wii and Nintendo DS. The game was released on March 2, 2010. Updates New to the series is the \\"My Player\\" feature, a career mode in which the player shepherds a player's career from the minors to the majors. Other features from the previous game have been improved or tweaked, including hitting and pitching. The game also features \\"MLB Today\\", an online ticker that tracks real-life Major League Baseball news and scores. With the MLB Today feature you can also play the same game that is being played in the real MLB. For example, if the New York Yankees are playing the Boston Red Sox and CC Sabathia is pitching, in the game he will be pitching along with the same lineup that is being used. The commentary has been improved as well, which analyze stats from the current year, the previous year, the previous series, and so forth. The crowd noise has also been reworked and sounds better than any previous version.http://ps3.ign.com/articles/106/1060936p1.html The Franchise Mode has been enhanced as well. Players can choose multiple teams and run their franchise, and can make staff personnel decisions. There are now 40 man rosters for Spring Training and September call ups. Players also have a minor league system that run from Single A through Triple A. Players can draft players from the high school, college, and amateur league level. Teams now receive compensatory draft picks from Type A and B free agents as well. Players can invite friends to play against them within the Franchise Mode, as well as online player updates. Like NBA 2K10, Major League Baseball 2K10 celebrates its 10th anniversary, going back to its Sega Dreamcast origins as World Series Baseball, though the series began in 1994 with the Sega Genesis release of World Series Baseball. Commentators The commentary is delivered by Steve Phillips, Gary Thorne, and John Kruk. For the Wii version, Kruk is not in the commentary booth. Cover athlete Tampa Bay Rays third baseman and Gold Glove Award winner Evan Longoria was announced as the cover athlete for 2K10, replacing two-time NL Cy Young Award winner Tim Lincecum from MLB 2K9. Reception MLB 2K10 received mixed to positive reviews. GameZone's Michael Lafferty gave the game a 7/10, saying \\"In the past, the 2K series was hampered by a lot of little things. The developers obviously put a lot of time in improving the overall gameplay and it shows. The new modes are fun but need some attention to iron out bugs, and there are some areas where the errors are just downright contrary to the game of baseball. On the surface, baseball seems a simple game, but to the baseball fan, the layers of complexity are what create that overall feeling that is Major League Baseball.\\" Promotion In early February, game publisher 2K Sports announced a contest where players had a chance to win $1,000,000 for pitching a perfect game on the Xbox 360 or PS3 versions of the game. The feat was finally achieved by Wade McGilberry of Mobile, Alabama who used the Atlanta Braves pitcher Kenshin Kawakami.

The scheme extended the provision of free bus travel within individual local authorities to allow travel throughout England from 1 April 2008. English residents who have attained the state pension age for women, which is gradually being increased from 60 to 66, as well as eligible disabled people, are provided with free off-peak bus travel on weekdays and all day at weekends and bank holidays. Certain local authorities offer extra benefits for use within their area. Comparable schemes operate within Wales and Scotland. There are two types of concessionary pass. The Senior pass has a blue panel at the right hand side of the pass. A disabled person's pass has an orange panel. A Senior pass is valid between 09:30 and 23:00 on weekdays and at any time at weekends and public holidays. The pass is valid at all times on TfL operated bus services for journeys within Greater London or those that begin or end in Greater London. An accessibility pass has the same statutory validity, but some authorities allow disabled persons to travel at additional times. Both types of pass are valid throughout England only. Additionally some authorities allow qualifying holders of an accessibility pass to be accompanied by a companion who is entitled to free travel when and while accompanying the pass holder. This scheme is not nationwide and consequently the companion can only accompany the disabled person within the administrative area of the pass issuer and the area of any other authority that accepts a companion pass from other areas.

Dardik is notable as being among the first medical doctors to endorse the use of chiropractic in sports, when he recommended in 1979 that the United States Olympic Committee include a Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) as a member of its medical team at all future Olympic Games. As a result, chiropractor George Goodheart attended the XIIIth Winter Olympic Games, in Lake Placid, NY, and the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs instituted a Volunteer Doctor Program for D.C.'s. In 1980, Dardik helped direct the inaugural Olympic Sports Medicine Conference (Feb 26 through 29) in Boston. In the early 1970s, together with his brother Dr. Herbert Dardik, he pioneered the use of umbilical veins as a source of graft tissue for bypass surgeries. \\"Supersonant waveenergy\\" theory Dardik developed a system of treating diseases using wave form technology, which he called \\"supersonant waveenergy\\". His system basically involved exercise techniques that were designed to modulate the cardiac rhythms in order to amplify the body's natural wave frequencies to fight disease. Dardik is co-author (with Denis Waitley) of Quantum Fitness: Breakthrough to Excellence. In this book, Dardik promotes his wave energy techniques as an alternative fitness regimen. Disciplinary history In 1995, Dardik was stripped of his license to practice medicine, following a successful lawsuit filed by a former patient, Ellen Burstein MacFarlane, a former consumer-action reporter who had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1985. Dardik had claimed in a 1991 New York Magazine cover story that he could cure multiple sclerosis with wave energy therapy. Dardik charged MacFarlane and her family $100,000, with the promise that not only could he cure her multiple sclerosis, but also that he would personally be available for the treatment sessions. After receiving his fee, Dardik treated MacFarlane in person at most 10 times during a 10-month period, sending proxies intermittently. MacFarlane's disease progressed, and her condition worsened. MacFarlane wrote a book with her sister, Legwork: An Inspiring Journey Through a Chronic Illness (Lisa Drew/Simon & Schuster 1994), in which she asserted that Dardik robbed her of not only money, but also of her hope for recovery. In July 1995, Dardik was found guilty of defrauding a total of five patients, including MacFarlane, by the State of New York Department of Health Administrative Review Board for Professional Medical Conduct, which revoked his New York medical license and fined him $40,000. MacFarlane died in 2004. Cold fusion In 2004, Dardik put his waveenergy theory to use attempting to produce cold fusion. Working with Israeli company Energetics Technologies, his group claimed \\"startling results.\\" Energetics Technologies is currently set up at the Business Incubator of the University of Missouri Dardik appears in \\"The Believers,\\" a 2012 film about cold fusion, in which he claims to use his theories to both explain cold fusion and to treat cold fusion proponent Martin Fleischmann for his Parkinson's disease.Screen Daily, \\"The Believers\\", Oct. 7, 2012 Legal history In 1996, a New Jersey family court judge ordered that Dardik spend evenings in the Bergen County Jail until he could pay $24,000 towards spousal and child support arrears totaling $850,000. In 2013, Dardik was again jailed by a New Jersey judge for support arrears totaling $1,205,300.03.

Biography Dance was the son of George Dance, architect. During thirty years he was in the office of the late insolvent debtors' court, in which he was successively registrar, taxing officer, and chief clerk, retiring ultimately upon a superannuation allowance. Alone or in collaboration with James Planch√© or others he wrote many pieces, chiefly of the lightest description, which were produced at the Olympic or other theatres. So great was his success in supplying Madame Vestris with extravaganzas that he was spoken of as a founder of a new order of burlesque. His pieces, which are mostly printed in Lacy's ‚ÄòActing Edition of Plays,‚Äô John Duncombe's ‚ÄòBritish Theatre,‚Äô Webster's ‚ÄòActing National Drama,‚Äô and John Miller's ‚ÄòModern Acting Drama,‚Äô cover a period of nearly a quarter of a century. Some of his comediettas or farces, as The Bengal Tiger, Delicate Ground, A Morning Call, Who speaks first, and Naval Engagements, continued to be occasionally revived up to the end of the 19th century, and one of his pieces was translated into German. Among his extravaganzas the best known is Olympic Revels, with which, 3 January 1831, Madame Vestris‚Äîthe first feminine lessee of a theatre, according to the prologue, by John Hamilton Reynolds, spoken on the occasion‚Äîopened the Olympic. Other pieces in which Dance had more or less share are, Alive and Merry, a farce; Lucky Stars, a burletta; Advice Gratis, a farce; A Wonderful Woman, comic drama; Blue Beard, a musical burletta; A Dream of the Future, a comedy; The Victor vanquished, a comedy; Marriage a Lottery, a comedy; The Stock Exchange, a comic drama; The Paphian Bower, an extravaganza; Telemachus, an extravaganza; Pleasant Dreams, a farce; The Country Squire, a comedy; Toquet with the Tuft, a burletta; Puss in Boots, a burletta; Sons and Systems, a burletta; The Burlington Arcade,‚Äô a burletta; Izaak Walton, a drama; The Beulah Spa, a burletta; The Dustman's Belle, a comic drama; A Match in the Dark, a comedietta; and The Water Party, a farce. During his later years Dance was a well-known figure at the Garrick Club. Dance was twice married, and survived both his wives. He lived in Mornington Road, not far from Regent's Park, and died at Lowestoft, whither he had returned for his health, 5 January 1863. His illness was heart disease.

The district encompasses a residential area in southwest Barrington and is roughly bounded by the Chicago and Northwestern Railway tracks to the north, Dundee Avenue to the west, E. Hillside and W. Coolidge Streets to the south, and S. Spring and S. Grove Streets to the east. The large majority of the district is in Cook County, but about one square block is in Lake County, Illinois. History The first settlers to Barrington, Illinois arrived in the 1830s. Barrington and Troy Townships organized in 1850. Barrington is named after Great Barrington, Massachusetts, the origin town of several early settlers. Benjamin Felter owned the original land claim for the south part of the village. Following a connection to the Chicago and North Western in 1854, the land was purchased by A. S. Downs as an investment. Downs sold the land to Robert Campbell, who divided the land for residential and commercial use. The town rapidly expanded and incorporation as Barrington Station followed in 1863. By 1865, the population was approximately 300. The name was changed to Barrington in 1873. The area that became the historic district was designed a typical Midwestern grid. Most of the houses are built from wood, which was locally plentiful. This contributes to the homogeny of the district, despite a variety in architectural motifs. Its development followed a typical pattern of towns that transitioned from rural to suburban. The Barrington Historic District includes the Octagon House, one of the few such houses in the state. The Catlow Theater, which was added later to the NRHP, on West Main St. is just north of the district. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 16, 1986. Architecture House at 224 W. Main St. in Lake County The houses in the district were mainly built between 1860 and 1930 and were designed in a wide variety of architectural styles, including American Craftsman, Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, Italianate, Neoclassical, Queen Anne, and vernacular styles. Despite their differing architectural styles, the houses in the district have many similar characteristics; most of them are built partly or entirely with wood, and nearly all are one-and-one- half to two story buildings set back a similar distance from the street. Almost 80% of the homes in the district are contributing properties to the district's historical significance. The houses represent Barrington's architectural development, and their progression of styles is reflective of prevailing patterns in American architecture from 1860 to 1930.

She was associated with two important artistic movements of the mid-19th century: the Pre-Raphaelite painters of Britain and the Macchiaioli of Italy. Biography Jane Benham was born in London in 1829 to a family of iron and metal workers. She travelled to Munich in 1850 with a friend, Anna Mary Howitt (1824‚Äì1884).Jan Marsh and Pamela Gerrish Nunn, Pre-Raphaelite Women Artists, Manchester City Art Galleries, 1997, p. 109 Together, they hoped to engage in serious study of drawing and painting, but after their arrival in Munich, it became clear that women would not be permitted to study at the Academy in D√ºsseldorf. Undeterred, they approached Wilhelm von Kaulbach, then Director of the Academy, and requested the privilege of private study in his studio. He agreed and permitted them to work there at liberty, although it is unclear how much formal instruction he gave them. Jane stayed in Munich until December 1850, when she was compelled to return to London. Anna Mary remained in Munich for two full years, returning to London in 1852. There she compiled her diary and personal letters into a text, An Art Student in Munich, which was published in 1853 and reissued in 1880. In the text, she uses the pseudonym Clare to refer to Jane Benham.Jan Nunn, ed. Canvassing, 1986, p. 24. Jane married artist William Hay in 1851 and they had a son the following year. However, their marriage did not last long as Jane left London for Florence in the mid-1850s. Around the same time, she met Francesco Saverio Altamura (born 1822 or 1826 ‚Äì died 1897), a painter who had associated with Macchiaioli painters of Tuscany, who are considered the Italian precursors to the Impressionists. Altamura had had a colourful life and gained a predilection for historical and religious paintings. They married and had a son together, Bernardo Hay (1864‚Äì1934). Jane Benham Hay exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1848, 1849, 1859, 1861, and 1862.Clarissa Campbell Orr, Women in the Victorian Art World, Manchester, 1995, p. 120. Her two entries of 1859, England and Italy and Portrait of a Boy in Florentine Costume, established her reputation. Painted just prior to the unification of Italy, England and Italy was a powerful statement in favour of democratic unification, as well as a compelling work of art. John Ruskin noted that both works were \\"masterly complete in effect\\".John Ruskin, Academy Notes, Cook and Wedderburn, eds, Library Edition of the Collected Works of John Ruskin, London, 1903‚Äì1912, vol. 14, pp. 211‚Äì12. although he did not care for the political overtones. England and Italy went missing some time after 1859, and was not rediscovered until the late 1990s. In 1867 Jane Hay achieved her greatest professional success with The Florentine Procession, also known as The Burning of the Vanities, which was exhibited by Henry Wallis at the French Gallery in London.

The fire started at 1:15 p.m. on November 29, 1973; 103 people died. After the fire, regulations pertaining to the construction of buildings were strengthened, one of which mandated external stairs on highrise buildings. The Taiyo Department Store had a basement floor and nine stories. Some areas were under construction. It was the most popular department store in Kumamoto City at that time.Kumamoto Nichinichi Shimbun(newspaper) articles (1973) Concerining various fire stories. Description The fire started on the platform of steps between the second and third floors, on which goods were placed. The cause of the fire was never determined. The fire sprinkler system did not work because of ongoing construction work. The fire was televised live and it was reported that the smoke, which was in various colors and odors, was poisonous. Many people were saved from the rooftop of the store. Some people jumped to the ceiling of a nearby arcade under construction and were injured. There were a total of 100 fatalities. Among the department store employees, 10 men and 36 women died, as well as three part-time female workers and three male construction workers. Among customers, 16 males and 32 females died. Causes of death included 70 deaths by carbon dioxide intoxication and 30 deaths by suffocation. Forty-three males and 77 females were injured. Seventy-one dead bodies were found: two on the third floor, 11 on the fourth floor, one on the fifth floor, 26 on the sixth floor, 30 on the seventh floor, and one on the eighth floor.Suefuji, S.(1985) The realities of department store fires and countermeasures. Ooitaken Igakukai Zasshi (Oita Prefecture Medical Association Journal) 3,1. (in Japanese) The fire was one of the deadliest department store fires in Japan. Analysis The Kumamoto City Physicians' Association later pointed out that every physicians' association should prepare for such disasters and organize rescue teams with medical instruments. Injured persons should be saved and transferred as soon as possible. There should be a unified system which gives directions in such large-scale disasters. Practitioners should work as volunteers. Soon after the fire, a university professor observed the burnt department store and wrote the following comments.Taiyo department fire(1974) Tsukamoto K. (Nihon University) Yobo Jiho Vol. 97 Japan Nonlife Insurance Association, Tokyo * It was reported that smoke issued from a cardboard box; a part-time employee informed Employees A and B, who informed Section Chief D and 4 or 5 people rushed to the scene. A fire hose did not work because of low pressure. An ABC fire extinguisher(s) was there, though they may not have known how to use it; 20 bucketfuls of water were not effective. The fire wall went down after the button was pushed twice; however some Japanese cushions were in the way and caught fire. * The response of the department store was poor. Telephone Operator E received the fire call from A and B, and forwarded the call to Chief F; who said he dialed 119 but it did not go to the fire station. The inside broadcasting system required the permission of a superior who could not be reached. Operator E could view what was happening but escaped on the elevator with other employees. * Additional factors included lack of ambient illumination; many persons stated that the electricity went down and smoke darkened the interior. Without the guidance of employees, it was hard for customers to find employees' elevators to escape. With the guidance of employees, 70 guests who were in the dining room and 60 employees escaped to the rooftop. Aftermath The 1972 Sennichi Department Store Building fire and the 1973 Taiyo Department Store fire, both of which caused many casualties, finally led to amendments of the Construction Standard Law and the Fire Fighting Law. These amendments mandated steps to prevent smoke from hindering escape. References *Shinbun-ni-miru sesou Kumamoto Shouwahen (1993), Kumamoto-Nichi-Nichi Shinbun.

(See Michael Scott, cited below, for a laudatory appraisal of his singing.) The creator of the title role in Umberto Giordano's verismo opera Andrea Ch√©nier, he subsequently earned renown for his performances of the music of Richard Wagner, becoming in 1904 the first Italian tenor to appear at the Bayreuth Festival. He sang a variety of leading roles at La Scala, Milan, from 1896 until 1914, but deteriorating eyesight caused by glaucoma put a premature end to his stage career, after which he turned successfully to teaching. Biography Borgatti was born into a poor rural family from the Province of Ferrara in northern Italy and grew up illiterate, according to the music- performance historian John Rosselli. This handicap did not prevent Borgatti from finding work as a bricklayer/stone-cutter. He was also called up by the authorities to discharge a compulsory period of military service. Luckily, a wealthy patron happened to hear him sing. Struck by the inherent quality of Borgatti's voice, the patron arranged for him to have professional singing lessons and acquire basic educational skills. His voice teachers included Alessandro Busi in Bologna and, later, Carlo d'Ormeville. In 1892 (some sources say 1893), Borgatti made his operatic debut at Castelfranco Veneto, singing the role of Faust in the opera of the same name by Charles Gounod. A string of performances at other Italian opera houses ensued in mainly lyric parts. Eighteen ninety-four saw Borgatti successfully undertake the role of the Chevalier des Grieux in a notable production in Venice of Giacomo Puccini's Manon Lescaut. Later that same year he appeared at another major venue, the Teatro Dal Verme in Milan, as Lohengrin (his first assumption of a Wagnerian part). His career was now gaining real momentum but he would not become a major opera star until 1896 when, at Milan's La Scala, he sang in the premiere performance of Andrea Ch√©nier to great acclaim. Although Borgatti continued to appear in a number of Italian operas after 1896, earning particular renown for his performances in works by Giuseppe Verdi, Puccini and the various verismo composers, he fell strongly under the spell of Wagner's music dramas. He worked closely with La Scala's principal conductor, Arturo Toscanini, from 1898 through into the early 1900s, and proceeded to master all the main tenor parts of the Wagnerian repertoire, namely, Lohengrin, Tannh√§user, Walther, Tristan, Siegmund, Siegfried and, finally, Parsifal. In 1898, he toured South America with a first-class troupe of Italian singers which included his fellow tenor Francesco Tamagno, the soprano Luisa Tetrazzini and the baritones Mario Sammarco and Eugenio Giraldoni. He also visited Spain and Russia. In 1901, he took part in a \\"grand concert\\" at La Scala that had been organised to mark the recent death of Verdi. Toscanini conducted the concert and among the array of soloists participating in it with Borgatti were Tamagno and the rising tenor star Enrico Caruso. Borgatti was accorded the honour of being the first Italian tenor invited to sing at Germany's Bayreuth Festival in 1904. Both Cosima Wagner (the composer's widow and the festival's director) and the important Wagnerian conductor Hans Richter praised Borgatti's voice and artistry. In 1906, he made a different venture into the field of German opera when he sang Herod in the La Scala premiere of Salome by Richard Strauss. Two years later, he was called upon to perform at the new Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires. Good-looking and solidly built‚Äîas photographs attest‚ÄîBorgatti is described in contemporary reviews of his performances as having possessed abundant reserves of stamina and strong histrionic ability in addition to a smooth, well-schooled voice of robust size. Modern-day critics, including Scott, J.B. Steane and John Freestone, have praised him, too, for the clarity of his diction, the limpidity of his tone and the fineness of his phrasing. He took pride in the fact that even after he took on the heavy Wagnerian repertoire, he was still able to put across a bel canto aria like \\"Una furtiva lagrima\\" (from Gaetano Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore) with lyrical ease. Oddly enough, despite his exceptional attainments as a singer and interpretive artist, he never performed in London or New York City. At the height of his career, in 1907, Borgatti began losing his sight due to glaucoma. This affliction grew steadily worse, obliging him to retire from the operatic stage seven years after its onset, even though his voice was still in excellent condition. He kept giving concerts, however, and the theatre in his home town of Cento was named in his honour in 1924. By this juncture, he was blind in both eyes. His last public performance occurred in Bologna in 1928. He taught singing in Milan following the curtailment of his opera house career. His best known pupils were the English lyric tenor Heddle Nash (1894‚Äì1961) and the German lyric baritone Willi Domgraf-Fassbaender (1897‚Äì1978). Borgatti married one of his singing teachers, Elena Cuccoli. They had a daughter, Renata Borgatti (1894‚Äì1964), who became a concert pianist. Borgatti died at a resort town near Italy's Lake Maggiore in 1950, aged 79. Recordings Giuseppe Borgatti's singing is preserved on fewer than 20 acoustic discs that he made in Milan for Fonotipia Records and the Path√© company in 1905 and 1919 respectively. They include extracts from four different operatic works by Wagner, all sung in Italian, and one aria each by Verdi (\\"Niun me tema\\" from Otello) and Puccini (\\"E lucevan le stelle\\" from Tosca; Borgatti had been La Scala's original Cavaradossi in 1900). For some reason, he recorded nothing from his breakthrough opera, Andrea Ch√©nier, or from some of the other Italian operas with which he had become especially associated, such as Mefistofele, Aida, La traviata, La Gioconda, Pagliacci, Manon Lescaut and Fedora. He did, however, commit to wax his interpretations of two short examples of lieder by Robert Schumann. Like the Wagner pieces, they are sung in Italian. Borgatti's acoustic recordings are available on various CD anthologies, including those issued by the Symposium label (catalogue number 1199), EMI's \\"La Scala Edition, Volume One\\" (CHS 7 64860 2) and Nuova Era Records (PH 5110). In 1928, he recorded several rare sides electrically for the Columbia company.

He is best known as the father of James Wolfe, famous for his capture of Quebec in 1759. Early life Edward Wolfe's son James Wolfe, who was to find fame in the Seven Years' War Wolfe was born in 1685 in York, of Irish Catholic descent. The family had been active in Irish nationalist circles, which had forced them to flee the country and settle in England. The family later converted to Protestantism and served in the military. Wolfe acquired a commission as a lieutenant in 1700, rising quickly to captain in 1705 and becoming a brigade major during the Flanders Campaign of the Duke of Marlborough. In 1715 he served with General Wade in the Scottish Highlands, suppressing the Jacobite-supporting clans who had recently risen in rebellion. The Treaty of Utrecht brought a long period of peace to Europe, limiting the opportunities for active service. In 1726 he married Henrietta Thompson, the sister of an MP Edward Thompson. In 1727 she gave birth to James Wolfe. Because of Edward's profession, James was immersed in military matters from a very young age. The family lived at Westerham in Kent, at what is now Quebec House, but moved to Greenwich in 1738 to be closer to London.Brumwell p.7 Cartagena Vernon showing Boca Chica, Cartagena - 2nd from the bottom leftthumbleft In 1739 with war with Spain looming, Wolfe prepared to return to active service. The declaration of the War of Jenkins' Ear triggered an expansion of the British military, with several new regiments of marines being created. Wolfe was promoted to Colonel and appointed to command one of the new regiments.Brumwell p.10 A major expedition was planned to sail for the Caribbean under Lord Cathcart to follow up the British victory at Porto Bello. In 1740 Wolfe and his travelled down to Portsmouth and then on to the Isle of Wight where the expedition was being assembled, bring his son with him as a volunteer. James Wolfe hoped to take part in the expedition, gaining valuable experience of soldiering. However, he fell badly ill and had to return home to Greenwich. Although James had felt humiliated, it had probably saved his life. The British assault Cartagena Edward Wolfe and his regiment took part in the expedition, which soon dissolved into a disaster. The British had decided to seize the port as Cartagena in South America, which was used to ship precious metals. However the British attacked during the rainy season and suffered around 18,000 casualties - almost entirely from disease. Abandoning the attack of Cartagena they then decided to attempt to capture Santiago in Cuba, only to be frustrated there as well. The expedition then returned home. Later career Wolfe had been lucky to survive the Cartagena disaster, in which some many of his comrades had died. He was made Colonel of the 8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot in 1745 and promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General in 1747. He had been too infirm to be considered for active service on the continent, once the War of the Austrian Succession broke out. However when the Jacobite rising broke out in 1745 Wolfe was sent to Berwick to command of a detachment of troops. As the Jacobites advanced into England using a different route he was not called into action. Death Edward Wolfe died on 26 March 1759 at the age of 74, while his son was crossing the Atlantic Ocean to assault French forces in Canada. During the campaign at Quebec, James Wolfe wore a black armband in mourning for his father.McLynn p.201 His own death while leading his troops to victory on the Plains of Abraham meant that father and son had both died in the \\"Year of Victories\\".

In 1832 he was convicted of larceny, and sentenced to seven years transportation. He often absconded and received an extended sentence as well as floggings and other punishments, and was finally sent to the dreaded Port Arthur in Van Diemen's Land.

This institute came into being when the erstwhile Jawahar Lal Nehru Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and other allied institution run by the council for the aid of crippled and handicapped were taken over by the government of India on 22 May 1975 and converted into an autonomous body in 1976. The erstwhile voluntary organisation was taken over by Ministry of Social Welfare in 1975 and converted into a registered society in 1976. Aims and objectives Human resource development in the fields of: * Physiotherapy or Physical Therapy * Occupational Therapy * Prosthetics and orthotics Rehabilitation by the way of Outpatient Services in the fields of Orthopedics, Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, Prosthetics and Orthotics, Speech Therapy and other rehabilitation services as the society may deem fit to orthopaedically disabled persons with associated mental retardation. Research and development: *To undertake, initiate, sponsor or stimulate research aimed at developing more effective techniques for the education and rehabilitation of the disabled persons. *To co-operate with national, regional or local agencies in research or such other activities as may be designed to promote the development of services for the disabled persons. Services The institute aims to serve the physically disabled of all age groups. In this pursuit of alleviating the suffering of disabled people, the institute runs the following programme: *Bachelor of Physical Therapy, Bachelor of Occupational Therapy and Bachelor of Prosthetics & Orthotics, 4-¬Ω years duration course in affiliation with University of Delhi. *Outpatient clinical services in Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy and Speech Therapy. *Workshop for the fabrication of Orthotic and Prosthetic appliances including calipers, splints, artificial limbs, surgical boots and customized wooden furniture for the persons with locomotor impairments. *Out- reach camps for the economically weaker disabled persons, living in far-flung and remote areas, with the help of district administration and locally active non-governmental organizations. *Extend institutional comprehensive rehabilitation services to persons with disabilities by establishing and operationalizing of Southern Regional Rehabilitation Centre (SRC), secunderabad (AP), District Disability Rehabilitation Centres (DDRCs) and facilitating the establishment of Regional Spinal Injury Centre. *Integrated School for orthopaedically disabled children up to Vth standard approved by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. *Social, psychological and vocational counseling services for people with disabilities. *Printing press to cater to the printing needs of the Institute and Ministry for dissemination of information and generation of awareness.

He was born in Tennessee and raised there for part of his childhood, until he was orphaned and adopted by family members in Pennsylvania. Starting in 1880, Carter attended the United States Naval Academy; he struggled academically at the school, only excelling in his art classes. Carter failed his final examinations in his final two years at the academy and was recommended for removal following the second failure. This did not happen, as he was forced to voluntarily resign from the school in 1883 due to permanent injuries received from an accident. Carter's time at the Naval Academy was not without success; in his second year, he singlehandedly managed to restart the school's football program after a two-year hiatus. Carter guided his team as a player-coach for the season, leading them to a victory over students from Johns Hopkins University, the first win in school history. Information about Carter following his resignation from the academy is scarce. One Navy football historian described him as having \\"disappeared from the historical record\\".Clary (1997), p. 11 He attended some classes at Swarthmore College in 1883, but he did not complete a course. During the late 1880s, Carter was an instructor at the Hebrew Technical Institute and also worked as an engineer; he designed a parachute and a model of a plan for the Nicaragua Canal, both of which attracted media attention. During the 1890s, he was an assignee for several corporations in New York City. Carter served as a lieutenant in the New York State Militia from 1902 to 1910. Later, during the 1920s, he lived with his sister on a farm in New York, occasionally writing articles for a magazine she edited. According to census records, Carter died by at least 1930. Biography and career At the United States Naval Academy Vaulx Carter was born in August 14, 1863, in western Tennessee, the sixteenth of seventeen children to Samuel Jefferson Carter. His mother was Anne Vaulx, the elder Carter's second wife.American Genealogical Research Institute (1972), pp. 299‚Äì301 He was raised there for the early part of his life, but was orphaned along with two of his siblings following his father's death in March 1873 and his mother's the next year. The siblings remained without a guardian until February 1875, when they were adopted by a family member and spent the rest of their childhood in Pennsylvania.Nashville Union and American (February 14, 1875), p. 4 In September 1880, Carter passed the entrance examinations for the United States Naval Academy and on the twenty- second of that month, he was admitted into the school, one of four people selected to represent Pennsylvania at the academy in that year's class.The Brooklyn Daily Eagle (September 26, 1880), p. 2Government Printing Office (1880), p. 26 In his second year at the school, Carter excelled in English and drawing, but had poor discipline and received 109 demerits; using a point evaluation system, the Naval Academy gave Carter fifty-three out of a possible seventy-six points for his conduct during the year.Government Printing Office (1881), pp. 20, 48 Between his second and third years, Cater sailed on the U.S.S.

The Clifton team was made up of players from Johns Hopkins University, who were unable to play for their school due to the administrator's negative views towards the sport.Kroll (2002), p. 14 Carter designed a maroon and white uniform for the squad and a strip of leather which was nailed to the bottom of their shoes to prevent slipping. It snowed heavily before the game, to the point where players for both teams had to clear layers of snow off of the field, making large piles of snow along the sides of the playing ground. The first half of the game was scoreless; the Baltimore American reported that \\"the visitors pushed Navy every place but over the goal line in the first half\\".Bealle (1951), p. 9 During play, the ball was kicked over the seawall a number of times, once going so far out it had to be retrieved by boat before play could continue.

It is located on the southwest side of the Antarctic Peninsula between the concave western coastline of Alexander Island and the shores of Charcot Island and Latady Island farther to the west. Its northern portion was first seen and roughly mapped in 1910 by the French Antarctic Expedition under Jean-Baptiste Charcot and was observed from the air in 1929 by Sir Hubert Wilkins. The configuration of the sound was determined in 1940 on exploratory flights by the US Antarctic Service (USAS). It was named by the USAS for Sir Hubert Wilkins, who in 1929 first proved \\"Charcot Land\\" to be an island (see Charcot Island) and thereby indirectly discovered this feature. The existence of Latady Island at the southwest side of the sound was determined in 1960 by D.J.H. Searle of Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) by examination of air photos taken by the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition (RARE), 1947-48\\\\. On 5 April 2009 the thin bridge of ice to the Wilkins Ice Shelf off the coast of Antarctica splintered, and scientists expect it could cause the collapse of the Shelf. There are reports the shelf has exploded into hundreds of small icebergs. David Vaughan of the British Antarctic Survey has attributed these events to global warming. Wilkins Ice Shelf 2008 partial collapse Diagram showing region of ice preventing further collapse The Wilkins Ice Shelf is a rectangular ice shelf about long and wide (). This feature occupies the central part of Wilkins Sound, from which it takes its name. The name was proposed by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) in 1971. Breakup and collapse events In 1993, Professor David Vaughan of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) predicted that the northern part of the Wilkins ice shelf was likely to be lost within 30 years if climate warming on the Peninsula were to continue at the same rate. A study by the National Academy of Sciences in 2002 stated, \\"Because air temperatures are statistically increasing along the Antarctic Peninsula region, the presence of glacial meltwater is likely to become more prevalent in these surface waters and continue to play an ever-increasing role in driving this fragile ecosystem.\\" In 2008 David Vaughan conceded his predictions had been too conservative and that events on the ground were moving quicker than he anticipated. On 25 March 2008 a chunk of the Wilkins ice shelf disintegrated, putting an even larger portion of the glacial ice shelf at risk.Associated Press, \\"Western Antarctic Ice Chunk Collapses\\"Satellite imagery from the United States \\"National Snow and Ice Data Center\\" Scientists at the University of Colorado at Boulder offered the first alert. (Mercopress, \\"Gigantic ice shelf breaking away\\", 2008-03-26). Scientists were surprised when they discovered the rest of the The US state of Connecticut is , the island of Jamaica . ice shelf is beginning to break away from the continent. What is left of the Wilkins ice shelf is now connected by only a narrow beam of ice. At the end of May 2008, another break-off further reduced the width of the connecting ice strip from . This second smaller event, with about of ice separating, was the first documented break-up that occurred in winter. The Wilkins Ice Shelf is not connected to inland glaciers in the same way as the Larsen B Ice Shelf was and will therefore have a negligible effect on sea level rise. On 29 November 2008, the European Space Agency (ESA) announced that the Wilkins Ice Shelf has lost around so far in 2008. A satellite image captured 26 November 2008 shows new rifts on the ice shelf that make it dangerously close to breaking away from the strip of ice‚Äîand the islands to which it is connected, the ESA said. On 20 January 2009, Reuters reported that the ice shelf could collapse into the ocean within \\"weeks or months\\". The shelf was then only held up by a very thin strip of ice (varying from 2 km to 500 meters at the narrowest), which made it very vulnerable to cracks and fissures. If the strip were to break, it would release the ice shelf, which now has the area of the state of Connecticut (about 14,000 km¬≤). Satellite evidence from 2 April 2009 led ESA analysts to conclude that the collapse of the strip (which would result in a partial break-away from the Antarctic Peninsula) was \\"imminent\\". Pursuant to this determination, ESA's Envisat satellite is observing the area on a daily basis. The satellite acquisitions are updated automatically to monitor the developments immediately as they occur. Additionally NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites overfly the area several times a day and some of the images acquired are also available. On 5 April 2009, the ice bridge connecting part of the ice shelf to Charcot Island collapsed. The break occurred at the thinnest point in the bridge and was the first in any of the sections that connect it to the mainland. While only a section has broken away, some scientists predicted that another large section of the Wilkins Ice Shelf was only days away from completely breaking off. The shelf remains connected to Latady Island, although it has been stated that this connection \\"looks set to collapse\\" as well. The breakaway is seen as firm evidence of the ongoing effects of warming. Temperatures in this region of Antarctica have risen by 2.5 degrees Celsius since the 1950s. Some scientists believe that the collapse of the weakened ice was triggered by increased wave action due to the current relative absence of sea ice, however, a prominent glaciologist, Doug MacAyeal, has said the trigger for the original break-up in March 2008 was likely the much longer wavelengths of ocean swells created by distant storms. If the entire shelf, which is approximately the size of Jamaica (10,991 km2, 4,244 sq mi), does completely break away from land it would be the largest one to do so, thus far. In the month of April 2009 alone, approximately 700 square kilometers (about 270.3 square miles) has broken off Wilkins Sound since the collapse of the ice bridge. The disintegration of the fringe of the ice shelf, weakened by previous breakups, has continued in March 2013. Image:Wilkins Ice Bridge Collapse (1).jpgThe Wilkins ice bridge still intact.

It is the site of the former Ledra Street barricade, across the United Nations buffer zone. The barricade symbolised the division of Nicosia between the Greek south and Turkish north. It was removed in April 2008 and Ledra Street became the sixth crossing between the southern and northern parts of Cyprus. Ledra Street runs parallel to Onasagorou Street. The name of the street refers to the ancient city-kingdom of Ledra, established in 1050 BC, that was located in the centre of the island where the capital city is today. Location Ledra street in the afternoon. The street leads off Eleftheria square, runs in a South to North direction and is about 1 km long. Most of it lies within the area effectively controlled by the Republic of Cyprus while a short stretch at the northern end between the UN buffer zone and the intersection with Arasta Street and Girne Caddesi falls within the Turkish part of Nicosia. Traditionally, Ledra Street was the main shopping street of the capital, although in recent years it has been superseded by more accessible streets further out from the centre. Properties on the street are largely for commercial use and command some of the highest real estate prices on the island.  History  During the EOKA attacks that ran from 1955-1959, the street acquired the informal nickname The Murder Mile in reference to the frequent targeting of the British military by nationalist fighters along its course. The sealing of Ledra Street Byway of Ledra Street in 1969 Ledra Street in 1969 In 1963, during the outbreak of hostilities between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities following the announcement of unilateral amendments to the Cypriot Constitution by request of Greek militant organizations, Turkish Cypriots withdrew to North Nicosia which became one of the many Turkish Cypriot enclaves which existed throughout the island. Various streets which ran between the northern and southern part of the city, including Ledra Street, were blockaded. A ceasefire was arranged at the end of 1963 and a neutral zone was established along the ceasefire or Green Line between north and south Nicosia which was patrolled by British personnel. With the formation of the UNFICYP, the task of patrolling the Green Line and protecting Turkish Cypriot enclaves was taken over by UN troops. During Turkish army's invasion in Cyprus in 1974, Turkish troops occupied northern Nicosia (as well as the northern part of Cyprus). A buffer zone was established across the island along the ceasefire line to separate the northern Turkish controlled part of the island, and the Greek controlled south. The buffer zone runs through Nicosia, where it is sometimes just several metres wide, and all roads running through the zone have been effectively sealed. The street south of the blockade was largely pedestrianised in 1998. Earlier attempts at reopening Modern day Ledra Street pedestrianised in 1998. Mandatory placement of flowers between shops and cafes by the Municipality of Nicosia since 2012 In December 2005, as talks between the north and south on the reopening of Ledra Street were on-going, the Turkish Cypriot side demolished the wall between the north and the UN buffer zone and began constructing a footbridge just north of the UN buffer zone. The move attracted protests from both the Greek Cypriot side and UNFICYP. The former expressed concerns over security, saying that the bridge allowed easy access for Turkish armed personnel in the buffer zone, while the latter said although there was no infringement of the buffer zone, it could not support the move to reopen Ledra Street at that time because the actions had not been agreed to by both sides. The Turkish Cypriot side removed the footbridge on 9 January 2007, a move which was welcomed by UNFICYP. Events leading to eventual opening Ledra Street roadblock in 1997. Busy Ledra Street during Christmas On 8 March 2007, the Greek Cypriot government demolished the wall between the southern portion of Ledra Street and the UN buffer zone and replaced it with 2m-high screens. Then Greek Cypriot president Tassos Papadopoulos said the Cyprus government had unilaterally planned for the dismantling of the Ledra Street wall. He added that with demolition of the wall, his government would consent to the passage being opened if Turkish troops which were present in the area were withdrawn, the derelict buildings on either side of Ledra Street strengthened and Turkish troops allowed UNFICYP to check for landmines. He reiterated that the obstacle to the opening was the presence of the Turkish troops and not the barricade. The move was immediately welcomed by the United Nations and several world leaders. Dimitris Christofias was elected president of Cyprus on 24 February 2008 on a platform of solving the Cyprus problem. In his first meeting with Turkish Cypriot president Mehmet Ali Talat on 21 March 2008, the two leaders agreed to reopen Ledra Street \\"as soon as technically possible\\". The United Nations Development Programme \\"Partnership for the Future - Mine Action Centre\\" proceeded to clear the area of mines on 26 March 2008, and work began to shore up the buildings flanking the street to ensure that they will not pose any danger to the users of the crossing.  Roadblock reopening after 34 years  Ledra Street Opening of Ledra Street in April 2008. On 3 April 2008 at 9 a.m. local time (06:00 UTC), the Ledra Street roadblock crossing through the UN buffer zone was reopened after 34 years, in the presence of Greek and Turkish Cypriot officials who cut a ribbon in Kykkou street, the road between Ledra Street and what is known as Lokmaci point in the Turkish controlled part of Nicosia. Addressing the ceremony, Presidential Commissioner George Iacovou said this day is \\"an auspicious occasion\\" as it signals the opening of the fifth crossing point in Cyprus. The International Herald Tribune reported that officials released balloons to mark the event at the end of an opening ceremony.Ledra Street crossing opens in Cyprus, Associated Press article on IHT website, 3 April 2008 Immediately afterwards, citizens from both sides began using the crossing. However, later in the day at 9 p.m. local time (18:00 UTC), the Cypriot police closed off the new Ledra Street checkpoint due to a violation of the agreement by the Turkish forces, whose guards penetrated deep into the UN controlled buffer zone. A Cypriot Police source said that two Turkish Guards had refused to leave the buffer zone which was agreed to remain under full UN control. The Cypriot authorities considered the move a breach of the agreement between the Greek Cypriot President and the Turkish Cypriot President and therefore quickly sealed off the checkpoint.Ledra closed after just 12 hours , Famagusta Gazette, April 3, 2008. After the arrival and mediation of UN officials, Turkish Cypriot forces withdrew back to their ceasefire positions and the crossing was reopened by the Cypriot Police. Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus maintains an immigration checkpoint on its side of the crossing and all pedestrians entering and leaving the North have to go through immigration checks. As with all Green Line crossings, Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus immigration will not place entry and exit stamps on passports but on separate visa slips issued by them. The Republic of Cyprus does not maintain any immigration checkpoint at Ledra Street or any other Green Line crossing. It however conducts identification checks on people entering the South from the North.

The buffer zone between the checkpoints that divide Ledra street was used as a space for activism from the 15th of October 2011 up until June 2012 by the Occupy Buffer Zone movement. On 2 September 2014 Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot citizens of Nicosia formed a human chain that stretched from the south part of Ledra Street to the north part of Ledra Street and through the UN checkpoint as a symbol of peace and unification. Ledra Street has been the starting point of protesters and activists against the austerity imposed by consecutive Cypriot governments such as cuts in civil service salaries and social benefits after the Credit crunch. On 26 April 2011 anti-nuclear protesters formed a bi- communal human chain to express their concern and fear over radiation leaks from a planned nuclear power plant in Akkuyu,Turkey. Protesters were also commemorating the anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident. The human chain was joined by The Progressive Party of the Working People (AKEL), New Cyprus Party (YKP), United Cyprus Party (BKP), Cyprus Green Party, EDON, KT√ñS, KTOE√ñS, KTAMS, DA√ú-BIR-SEN, BES, √áAG-SEN, Turkish Cypriot Association for Democracy (UK), T/C The Chamber of Electrical Engineers (EMO), T/C Chamber of Industrial Engineers (ENMO), T/C Chamber of Mechanical Engineers (MMO), T/C Chamber of Environmental Engineers (√áMO), Friends of Nature, and Green Action Group (Yesil Baris Hareketi). The southern part of Ledra Street is the starting point of Cyprus' annual Gay pride parade initiated in 2014 by the Mayor Constantinos Yiorkadjis. The event was organised by the association \\"Accept-LGBT Cyprus\\" which is open to all regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic, cultural background, religious background, language, health condition or physical condition and supports equal rights for the LGBT community.

Reception Critical response The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther wrote, \\"Another convincing demonstration that crime, while it may not 'pay,' can be turned to profitable uses by the makers of action films is given by Canon City, a tough semi-documentary job about a prison break in Colorado ... Crane Wilbur has held to a realistic line for much of the prison action and in some of the outside episodes. His actors‚Äîespecially Jeff Corey, who plays the leader of the 'break'‚Äîare generally tough, convincing fellows with nothing to recommend in charm. And the movement is swift and dynamic, not unlikely in such affairs.\\"Crowther, Bosley. Ibid. Critic Dennis Schwartz said of the film, \\"An unspectacular true story (it's dated) about a prison break that is told in a semi-documentary style. Its saving grace is that it is well presented ...This minor work has some resemblance to film noir through the characterization of Sherbondy as someone who is not a hardened criminal, but got into trouble both on the outside and then inside of prison because he made the wrong friends.\\"Schwartz, Dennis .

The rebellion, which began on August 18, 1823, and lasted for two days, was led by slaves with the highest status. In part they were reacting to poor treatment and a desire for freedom; in addition, there was a widespread, mistaken belief that Parliament had passed a law for emancipation, but it was being withheld by the colonial rulers. Instigated chiefly by Jack Gladstone, a slave at \\"Success\\" plantation, the rebellion also involved his father, Quamina, and other senior members of their church group. Its English pastor, John Smith, was implicated. The largely non-violent rebellion was brutally crushed by the colonists under governor John Murray. They killed many slaves: estimates of the toll from fighting range from 100 to 250. After the insurrection was put down, the government sentenced another 45 men to death, and 27 were executed. The executed slaves' bodies were displayed in public for months afterwards as a deterrent to others. Jack was deported to the island of Saint Lucia after the rebellion following a clemency plea by Sir John Gladstone, the owner of \\"Success\\" plantation. John Smith, who had been court-martialed and was awaiting news of his appeal against a death sentence, died a martyr for the abolitionist cause. News of Smith's death strengthened the abolitionist movement in Britain. Quamina, who is thought to have been the actual leader of the rebellion, was declared a national hero after Guyana's independence. Streets and monuments have been dedicated to him in the capital of Georgetown, Guyana.  Context  Demerara was first colonised by the Dutch in the 17th century under the auspices of the Dutch West India Company (DWIC). The economy, initially based on trade, began to be superseded in the 18th century by sugar cane cultivation on large plantations. The Demerara region was opened to settlement in 1746, and new opportunities attracted British settlers from nearby Barbados. By 1760, they had become the largest contingent in Demerara; the 1762 business registers showed that 34 of 93 plantations owned by Englishmen. The British were a major external threat to Dutch control over the colonies from 1781 until 1796, when Britain obtained de facto control. Following a raid by privateers in February 1781, British occupation lasted until January 1782, when the island was recaptured by the French, then allied with the Dutch. The British transferred rule of Demerara to the Dutch in 1802 under the terms of the Peace of Amiens, but took back control of it a year later. In 1812, the British merged Demerara and Essequibo into the colony of Demerara-Essequibo. The colonies were ceded to Britain by treaty between the Netherlands and Britain on 13 August 1814. Stabroek, as the colony's capital was known under the Dutch, was renamed as Georgetown in 1812. The colonial powers appointed a governor to rule in their stead, and the local legislation was decided on by a Court of Policy. The mainstay of its economy was sugar, grown on cane plantations worked by slaves. The sale of the crop in Britain enjoyed preferential terms. There were 2,571 declared slaves working on 68 plantations in Essequibo, and 1,648 slaves in Demerara in 1762. These numbers were known to be much understated, as the slave headcount was the basis of taxation. By 1769, there were 3,986 declared slaves for Essequibo's 92 plantations and 5,967 for Demerara's 206 plantations. The slave labour was in short supply and expensive due to the trading monopoly of the DWIC, and smuggling from Barbados was rife. Dutch colonists ensured white dominance over their growing slave population through the collaboration of indigenous natives, who strongly resisted white domination but could also be relied upon to take up arms against any Spanish incursions. When slaves rose up in Berbice in 1763, natives blocked the border to prevent the disruption from spreading into Demerara. Rapid expansion of plantations in the 19th century increased demand for African slaves at a time when supplies were reduced. The supply shortage of labour for production was exacerbated by the British abolition of trade in slaves in the Slave Trade Act 1807. The population consisted of 2,500 whites, 2,500 freed blacks, and 77,000 slaves. Ethnically, there were 34,462 African-born as against 39,956 \\"creole Negroes\\" by 1823 in Demerara and Essequibo. Treatment of slaves were markedly different from owner to owner, and from plantation to plantation. Plantations managed by agents and attorneys for absentee owners were common. Caucasian owners and managers were prevalent, and there were very few mixed-race \\"mulattoes\\" who advanced to become managers and owners. Lower-class whites and coloureds were considered \\"superior\\", giving them access to skilled work. Blacks who performed skilled work, or worked within households and enjoyed greater autonomy, were regarded as having higher-status than other slaves. Slaves who toiled in the fields would work under drivers also slaves, but who had delegated authority of plantation overseers.  The plantations  alt=Map of northern coast of today's Georgetown Guyana in 1823, showing the plantations as neat narrow strips perpendicular to the coastAlthough some plantation owners were enlightened or paternalistic, the slave population was on the whole poorly treated. Churches for whites existed from the inauguration of the colonies, but slaves were barred from worshipping before 1807 as colonists feared education and Christianisation would lead slaves to question their status and lead to dissatisfaction. Indeed, a Wesleyan missionary who arrived in 1805 wanting to set up a church for slaves was immediately repatriated by order of the governor. The London Missionary Society (LMS) entered Guyana shortly after the end of the slave trade at the behest of a plantation owner who believed that slaves ought to have access to religious teachings.McGowan, Winston (30 August 2007). \\"The 1823 Demerara slave rebellion (Part 2)\\" Stabroek News Hermanus Post, a naturalised Englishman of Dutch descent, advocated teaching of religion and literacy. The idea, considered radical at the time, was supported by some who may have thought religion was to be offered as a consolation in place of emancipation. The colonial administration was hostile to the idea. It was written in the official journal, Royal Gazette, in 1808: \\"It is dangerous to make slaves Christians, without giving them their liberty.\\" Others strongly opposed. Other plantation owners, who felt that teaching slaves anything other than their duties to their masters would lead to \\"anarchy, chaos and discontent\\" and precipitate the destruction of the colony. Post ignored these protestations and made facilities available for worship.http://www.guyanatimesinternational.com/?p=27707 The facilities were easily outgrown by popularity of worship within just eight months. The LMS contributed ¬£100; Post gave the land and paid the balance, and a chapel with 600-person capacity was inaugurated on 11 September 1808. He also had a house constructed for the minister at a cost of ¬£1200, of which ¬£200 was subscribed by other \\"respectable inhabitants of the colony\\". The first pastor, Reverend John Wray, arrived in February 1808 and spent five years there; his wife operated a girls' school for white children. After the chapel's construction, the owner wrote of improvements: Post sought to have more missionaries appointed to other places in the colony. However, Post died in 1809, and was lamented by his slaves. Conditions of his slaves markedly deteriorated under new management - they were once again subject to whipping and forced to work on Saturdays and Sundays. Soon after Wray arrived in 1808, he fought for the rights of slaves in the colony to attend church services which would take place nightly. When Governor Henri Guillaume Bentinck declared all meetings after dark illegal, Wray obtained the support of some plantation owners and managers. Armed with their testimonials, he sought to confront Bentinck but was refused audience. Wray went to London to appeal directly to the government. When Wray was transferred to nearby Berbice at the end of his term, the mission was without a pastor for three years. John Smith, his replacement sent to the colony by the LMS, was equally welcomed by the slaves. Writing to the LMS, Smith said that the clergy was explicitly ordered to say nothing that would cause slaves' disenchantment with their masters or dissatisfaction with their status. Many in the colony resented the presence of the preachers, whom they believed were spies to the abolitionist movement in London. They feared that the religious teachings and the liberal attitudes promoted would eventually cause slaves to rebel. Colonists interrupted services, threw stones at the churches, barred ministers' access to certain plantations, refusing permission to build chapels on plantation land; slaves were stopped from attending services at every turn. Smith received a hostile reception from the Governor John Murray and from most colonists. They saw his chapel services as a threat to plantation output, and feared greater unrest. Smith reported to the LMS the Governor had told him that \\"planters will not allow their negroes to be taught to read, on pain of banishment from the colony.\\" Furthermore, religious instruction for slaves was endorsed by British Parliament, thus the plantation owners were obliged to permit slaves to attend despite their opposition. Colonists who attended were perceived by Smith to be disruptive or a distraction. Some overseers attended only to prevent their own slaves from attending. One of owners' complaints was that slaves had too far to walk to attend services. When Smith had requested land to erect a chapel from John Reed, owner of \\"Dochfour\\", the idea was vetoed by Governor Murray, allegedly because of complaints he had received about Smith. Colonists even perverted the intention of a circular from Britain which mandated giving slaves passes to attend services ‚Äì on 16 August 1823, the Governor issued a circular which required slaves to obtain owners' special dispensation to attend church meetings or services, causing a sharp decline in attendance at services. At about the same time, Smith wrote a letter back to George Burder, the Secretary of the LMS, lamenting the conditions of the slaves: Da Costa noted that the slaves who rebelled all had motives which were underpinned by their status as chattels: the families of many were caught in the turbulent changes in ownership of plantations and feared being sold and/or split up (as in the case of the slave Telemachus); Christians frequently complained of being harassed and chastised for their belief or their worshipping (Telemachus, Jacky Reed, Immanuel, Prince, Sandy); female slaves reported being abused or raped by owners or managers (Betsy, Susanna). Slaves were also often punished for frivolous reasons. Many managers/owners (McTurk, Spencer) would insist that slaves work on Sundays, and deny passes to attend church; Pollard, manager of \\"Non Pareil\\" and \\"Bachelor's Adventure\\", was notoriously violent. Quamina complained of frequently being deprived of his legal day off and missing church; unable to take care of his sickly wife, he found her dead one night after coming home.McGowan, Winston (13 September 2007). \\"The 1823 Demerara slave rebellion (Part 3)\\" Stabroek News Jack Gladstone, a slave on \\"Success\\", who did not work under a driver and enjoyed considerable freedom, learned of the debate about slavery in Britain, and had heard rumours of emancipation papers arriving from London. Among the plantation owners, Sir John Gladstone, father of British Prime Minister William, who had built his fortune as a trader, had acquired plantations in Demerara in 1812 through mortgage defaults. This included half share in \\"Success\\", one of the largest and most productive plantations there; he acquired the remaining half four years later. Gladstone switched the crop from coffee to sugar, and expanded his workforce of slaves from 160 to more than 330. Sir John would continue to acquire Demeraran plantations, often at fire sale prices after the rebellion and well into the decade, and his agents would be able to optimise his assets across the different properties. By the time emancipation was enacted in Britain in 1834, he owned four plantations ‚Äì \\"Vreedenhoop\\", \\"Success\\", \\"Wales\\" and \\"Vreedestein\\". John Smith, writing in his journal on 30 August 1817, said that the slaves of \\"Success\\" complained about the work load and very severe treatment. Sir John Gladstone, believing that the slaves on his estates were properly treated, wrote a letter to the Missionary Society on 24 December 1824 to clear his name. He wrote that his intentions have \\"ever been to treat my people with kindness in the attention to their wants of every description, and to grant them every reasonable and practicable indulgence.\\" He stated that the work gangs were doubled from 160 after production shifted to sugar from coffee. Gladstone later maintained that Gladstone, who had never set foot on his plantation, had been deluded by his attorney in Demerara, Frederick Cort, into believing that it was seldom necessary to punish the slaves. He asserted they were generally happy and contented, and were able to make considerable money by selling the surplus produce of their provision grounds. Subsequent to the revolt, the secretary of the London Missionary Society warned Gladstone that Cort had been lying, but Gladstone continued to identify himself with Cort and his other agents. Robertson, his second son, inspected the estates from 22 November 1828 to 3 March 1829, during which he observed that Cort was \\"an idler and a deceiver\\" who had mismanaged one estate after another. Only then was Cort dismissed. In Britain, Lord Howick and others criticised the concept of absentee landlords. Sir Benjamin d'Urban, who took up his office of Lieutenant Governor of Essequibo and Demerara in 1824, wrote to Earl Bathurst, Secretary of State for the Colonies, on 30 September 1824, criticising \\"..the injudicious managers under whom too many of the slaves are placed; half educated men of little discretion, or command over their own caprices; good planters perhaps ‚Äì but quite unfit to have the charge of bodies of men, although they might take very proper care of cattle\\".  The revolt  Slaves with the highest status such as coopers, and some other who were members of Smith's congregation, were implicated in leading the rebellion against the harsh conditions and maltreatment, demanding what they believed to be their right. Quamina and his son Jack Gladstone, both slaves on \\"Success\\" plantation, led their peers to revolt. Quamina, a member of Smith's church, had been one of five chosen to become deacons by the congregation soon after Smith's arrival. In the British House of Commons in May 1823, Thomas Fowell Buxton introduced a resolution condemning the state of slavery as \\"repugnant to the principles of the British constitution and of the Christian religion\\", and called for its gradual abolition \\"throughout the British colonies\\". In fact, the subject of these rumours were Orders in Council (to colonial administrations) drawn up by George Canning under pressure from abolitionists to ameliorate the conditions of slaves following a Commons debate. Its principal provisions were to restrict slaves' daily working hours to nine and to prohibit flogging for female slaves. Provisional Battalion lines up for review Whilst the Governor or Berbice immediately made a proclamation upon receiving his orders from London, and instructed local parson John Wray to explain the provisions to his congregation, John Murray, his counterpart in Demerara, had received the Order from London on 7 July 1823, and these measures proved controversial as they were discussed in the Court of Policy on 21 July and again on 6 August. They were passed as being inevitable, but the administration made no formal declaration as to its passing. The lack of formal declaration led to rumours that masters had received instructions to set the slaves free but were refusing to do so. In the weeks prior to the revolt, he sought confirmation of the veracity of the rumours from other slaves, particularly those who worked for those in a position to know: he thus obtained information from Susanna, housekeeper/mistress of John Hamilton of \\"Le Resouvenir\\"; from Daniel, the Governor's servant; Joe Simpson from \\"Le Reduit\\" and others. Specifically, Simpson had written a letter which said that their freedom was imminent but which warned them to be patient. Jack wrote a letter (signing his father's name) to the members of the chapel informing them of the \\"new law\\". Those on \\"Le Resouvenir\\", where Smith's chapel was situated, also rebelled. Quamina, who was well respected by slaves and freedmen alike, initially tried to stop the slave revolt, and urged instead for peaceful strike; he made the fellow slaves promise not to use violence. As an artisan cooper who did not work under a driver, Jack enjoyed considerable freedom to roam about. He was able to organise the rebellion through his formal and informal networks. Close conspirators who were church 'teachers' included Seaton (at \\"Success\\"), William (at \\"Chateau Margo\\"), David (at \\"Bonne Intention\\"), Jack (at \\"Dochfour\\"), Luke (at \\"Friendship\\"), Joseph (at \\"Bachelor's Adventure\\"), Sandy (at \\"Non Pareil\\"). Together, they finalised planning in the afternoon of Sunday 17 August for thousands of slaves to raise up against their masters the next morning. Joe of \\"Le Reduit\\" had informed his master at approximately 6 am that morning of a coordinated uprising planned the night before at Bethel chapel which would take place that same day. Captain Simpson, the owner, immediately rode to see the Governor, but stopped to alert several estates on the way into town. The governor assembled the cavalry, which Simpson was a part of. Although the rebellion leaders had hoped for mass action by all slaves, the actual unrest involved about 13,000 slaves over some 37 estates located on the east coast, between Georgetown and Mahaica. Slaves entered estates, ransacked the houses for weapons and ammunition, tied up the whites, or put some into stocks. The very low number of white deaths is cited as proof that the uprising was largely free from violence from the slaves. Accounts from witnesses indicate that the rebels exercised restraint, with only a very small number of white men were killed. Some slaves took revenge on their masters or overseers by putting them in stocks, like they themselves had been before. Slaves went in large groups, from plantation to plantation, seizing weapons and ammunition and locking up the whites, promising to release them in three days. However, according to Bryant, not all slaves were compliant with the rebels; some were loyal to their masters and held off against the rebels. alt=Black & white drawing of negroes with cutlasses fighting uniformed troops in an open field, some corpses and abandoned weapons lying on the groundThe Governor immediately declared martial law. The 21st Fusiliers and the 1st West India Regiment, aided by a volunteer battalion, were dispatched to combat the rebels, who were armed mainly with cutlasses and bayonets on poles, and a small number of stands of rifles captured from plantations. By the late afternoon on 20 August, the situation had been brought under control. Most of the slaves had been rounded up, although some of the rebels were shot whilst attempting to flee. On 22 August 1823, Lieutenant Governor Murray issued an account of the battles. He reported major confrontations on Tuesday morning at the Reed estate, \\"Dochfour\\", where ten to fifteen of the 800 rebels were killed; a skirmish at \\"Good Hope\\" felled \\"five or six\\" rebels. On Wednesday morning, six were killed at 'Beehive' plantation, forty rebels died at Elizabeth Hall. At a battle which took place at \\"Bachelor's Adventure\\", \\"a number considerably above 1500\\" were involved. After the slaves' defeat at \\"Bachelor's Adventure\\", Jack fled into the woods. A \\"handsome reward\\" of one thousand guilder was offered for his capture. The Governor also proclaimed a \\"FULL and FREE PARDON to all slaves who surrendered within 48 hours, provided that they shall not have been ringleaders (or guilty of Aggravated Excesses)\\". Jack remained at large until he and his wife were captured by Capt. McTurk at \\"Chateau Margo\\", after a three-hour standoff on 6 September. Trials alt=Map of northern coast of today's Georgetown Guyana in 1823, showing the plantations as neat narrow strips perpendicular to the coast On 25 August, the Governor Murray constituted a general court-martial, presided over by Lt.-Col. Stephen Arthur Goodman. Despite the initial revolt passing largely peacefully with slave masters locked in their homes, those who were considered ringleaders were tried at set up at different estates along the coast and executed by shooting; their heads were cut off and nailed to posts. A variety of sentences were handed out, including solitary confinement, lashing, and death. Bryant (1824) records 72 slaves having been sentenced by court-martial at the time of publication. He noted that 19 of the 45 death sentences had been carried out; a further 18 slaves had been reprieved. Quamina was among those executed; their bodies were hung up in chains by the side of a public road in front of their respective plantations and left to rot for months afterwards. Jack Gladstone was sold and deported to St Lucia; Da Costa suggests that a letter Sir John had sent on his behalf resulted in clemency. John Smith was arraigned in court-martial before Lt. Col. Goodman on 13 October, charged with four offences: \\"promoting discontent and dissatisfaction in the minds of the Negro Slaves towards their Lawful Masters, Overseers and Managers, inciting rebellion; advising, consulting and corresponding with Quamina, and further aiding and abetting Quamina in the revolt; failure to make known the planned rebellion to the proper authorities; did not use his best endeavours to suppress, detain and restrain Quamina once the rebellion was under way.\\" The officers on the court martial judging Smith included a young Captain Colin Campbell, later to become Field Marshal Lord Clyde.Greenwood, ch.4 Smith's trial concluded one month later, on 24 November. Smith was found guilty of the principal charges, and was given the death sentence. Pending an appeal, Smith was transferred from Colony House to prison, where he died of \\"consumption\\" in the early hours of 6 February 1824; To minimise the risk of stirring up slave sentiment, the colonists interred him at 4 am. The grave went without markings to avoid it becoming a rallying point for slaves. The Royal reprieve arrived on 30 March. Smith's death was a major step forward in the campaign to abolish slavery. News of his death was published in British newspapers, provoked enormous outrage and garnered 200 petitions to Parliament.  Aftermath  The rebellion took place a few months after the founding of the Anti-Slavery Society, and had a strong impact on Britain. Although public sentiment initially favoured the colonists, it changed with revelations. The abolitionist debate which had flagged, was galvanised by the deaths of Smith and the 250 slaves. The Martial law in Demerara was lifted on 19 January 1824. In Demerara and Berbice, there was considerable anger towards the missionaries that resulted in their oppression. Demerara's Court of Policy passed an ordinance giving financial assistance to a church that was selected by plantation owners in each district. The Le Resouvenir chapel was seized and taken over by the Anglican Church. Under pressure from London, the Demerara Court of Policy eventually passed an 'Ordinance for the religious instruction of slaves and for meliorating their condition' in 1825 which institutionalised working hours and some civil rights for slaves. The weekend was to be from sunset on Saturday to sunrise on Monday; field work was also defined to be from 6 am to 6 pm, with a mandatory two-hour break. A Protector of Slaves was appointed; whipping was abolished for women as was its use in the field. The rights to marriage and own property was legalised, as was the right to acquire manumission. Amendments and new ordinances continued to flow from London, each progressively establishing more civil rights for the slaves, but they were strongly resisted by the colonial legislature. Many planters refused to comply with their provisions. The confrontation continued as the planters challenged on several occasions the right of British government to pass laws binding on the colony, arguing that the Court of Policy has exclusive legislative power within the colony. Plantation owners who controlled the voting of the taxes disrupted administration by refusing to vote the civil list. In August 1833, the British parliament passed the 'Act for the abolition of slavery throughout the British Colonies, for promoting the industry of manumitted slaves, and for compensating the persons hitherto entitled to the services of such slaves', with effect from 1 August 1834. Plantation owners of British Guiana received ¬£4,297,117 10s. 6¬Ωd. in compensation for the loss of 84,915 slaves.

Insomnia and sleep deprivation are common symptoms of depression and can be an indication of other mental disorders.Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV. American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC: 1994 The consequences of not getting enough sleep could have dire results; not only to the health of the individual, but those around them as sleep deprivation increases the risk of human-error related accidents, especially with vigilance-based tasks involving technology.  Attention   Neural substrates  Parietal lobe The parietal lobes of the brain are largely involved in attention. Lesions to this region of the brain in humans result in difficulty or inability to attend to events that are contralateral to the lesioned hemisphere. Those with lesions to the posterior parietal lobe have little to no difficulty shifting attention to and from stimuli appearing in the space ipsilateral to the lesioned hemisphere. However, they do display a slowed response in shifting their focus of current attention to events and stimuli appearing contralateral to the lesioned hemisphere. Studies involving single-unit recordings from the parietal lobes of monkeys have indicated that there are neurons solely involved in integrating visual spatial information with postural information. Without this apparent combining of spatial information, it would be difficult or impossible to locate objects in external space, as information provided solely by the retina is insufficient. The position of the eyes, head and body must also be taken into consideration. In addition, studies involving transcranial magnetic stimulation application over the parietal lobes as well as positron emission tomography (PET) analysis of the parietal lobes suggest that this region is involved in conjunction searches, but not in single-feature searches.Ward, J. (2006). Space, Attention and the Parietal Lobes. The Student's Guide to Cognitive Neuroscience. New York, NY: Psychology Press (See Visual search for supplementary information.)  Auditory attention  The Primary auditory cortex is highlighted in magenta, and has been known to interact with all areas highlighted on this neural map. Auditory attention has been examined following sleep deprivation. Researchers examined the auditory attention of twelve non-sleep-deprived subjects and twelve sleep-deprived subjects at various time intervals. Subjects were involved in an auditory attention task, which required the reproduction of the spatial relationships between four letters, using a graph composed of six squares, immediately following the presentation of an item from a tape recorder. It was found that auditory attention of sleep-deprived individuals is affected as the total amount of sleep-deprivation increases, possibly due to lowered perceptual vigilance.  Divided attention  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of the brains of subjects exposed to thirty-five hours of sleep deprivation indicate that sleep deprivation is related to increases in prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe activation during tasks that combine verbal learning and arithmetic. This is particularly apparent in the right hemisphere. In non sleep-deprived individuals involved in verbal learning and arithmetic tasks the anterior cingulate cortex and the right prefrontal cortex are active. Following sleep deprivation there is increased activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus and the bilateral parietal lobes. This information suggests that divided attention tasks require more attentional resources than normally required by a non sleep-deprived individual.  Exogenous and endogenous attention  Studies using event-related potential (ERP) recordings have found that twenty- four hours of sleep deprivation decreases ERP response to signal inputs from endogenous, but not exogenous, sources. Therefore, it is suggested that sleep deprivation affects endogenously driven selective attention to a greater extent than exogenously driven selected attention.  Selective attention  Twenty-four hours of sleep deprivation has been found to affect the functional connectivity between the inferior frontal parietal region (IPS) and the parahippocampal place area (PPA). However, sleep deprivation does not affect the attention modulation index of the PPA. With this information, researchers have concluded that the psychophysiological interaction (PPI) is more involved in selective attention than the IPS and PPA.Chee, M. W. L., Tan, J. C., Parimal, S. & Zagoradnov, V. (2009). Sleep deprivation and its effects on object-selective attention. Neuroimage, 1-8 Research has found that together, attention and sleep deprivation modulate the parahippocampal place area (PPA) activation and scene processing. Specifically, sleep deprivation was related to significant decreases in PPA activation while attending to scenes and when ignoring scenes. This is explained by the absence of change in the Attention Modulation Index (AMI). Face recognition is not affected by sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation has been shown to negatively affect picture classification speed and accuracy, as well as recognition memory. It results in an inability to avoid attending to irrelevant information displayed during attention- related tasks. (Norton) It also decreases activation in the ventral visual area and the frontal parietal control regions.  Supervisory attention  Studies involving sleep deprived subjects‚Äô performance on choice reaction time tests, in which response inhibition, task shifting skill and task strategy were involved, have been conducted and analyzed. These three cognitive processes are involved and critical in tasks involving supervisory attention, which is defined as behaviour that arises through the selection and implementation of schemas. Following one night of total sleep deprivation, subjects showed no decline in task shifting or response inhibition performance. However, sleep deprivation does affect the ability to use preparatory bias to increase performance speed. It is suggested that the brain‚Äôs cognitive resources make an active effort to succeed in a challenging task when subjected to sleep deprivation, and that this deficit becomes apparent in tasks involving preparatory bias.  Visuospatial attention  Deficits in cognitive performance due to continuous sleep restriction are not well understood. However, there have been studies looking into physiological arousal of the sleep-deprived brain. Participants, whose total amount of sleep had been restricted by 33% throughout one week, were subjected to reaction time tests. The results of these tests were analyzed using quantitative EEG analysis. The results indicate that the frontal regions of the brain are first to be affected, whereas the parietal regions remain active until the effects of sleep deprivation become more severe, which occurred towards the end of the week. In addition, EEG and ERP analysis reveals that activation deficits are more apparent in the non-dominant hemisphere than in the dominant hemisphere. Thalamus. The effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance have been studied through the use of parametric visual attention tasks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging of participants' brains who were involved in ball- tracking tasks of various difficulty levels were obtained. These images were taken during rested wakefulness and again after one night of sleep deprivation. The thalamus is more highly activated when accompanied by sleep deprivation than when the subject is in a state of rested wakefulness. Contrarily, the thalamus is more highly activated during difficult tasks accompanied by rested wakefulness, but not during a state of sleep deprivation. Researchers propose that the thalamic resources, which are normally activated during difficult tasks, are being activated in an attempt to maintain alertness during states of sleep deprivation. In addition, an increase in thalamic activation is related to a decrease in the parietal, prefrontal and cingulate cortex activation, resulting in the overall impairment of attentional networks, which are necessary for visuospatial attention performance. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies indicate that the posterior cingulate (PCC) and medial prefrontal cortex are involved in the anticipatory allocation of spatial attention. When sleep- deprived, PCC activity decreases, impairing selective attention. Subjects were exposed to an attention-shifting task involving spatially informative, misleading and uninformative cues preceding the stimuli. When sleep-deprived, subjects showed increased activation in the left intraparietal sulcus. This region is activated when exposed to stimuli in unexpected locations. These findings suggest that sleep-deprived individuals may be impaired in their ability to anticipate the locations of upcoming events. In addition, inability to avoid attending to irrelevant events may also be induced by sleep- deprivation. By contrast, other studies have indicated that the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance, specifically, sustained visual attention, are more global and bilateral in nature, as opposed to more lateralized deficit explanations. In a study using the Choice Visual Perception Task, subjects were exposed to stimuli appearing in various locations in visual space. Results indicate that sleep deprivation results in a general decline in visual attention. It is also suggested that the sleep- deprived brain is able to maintain a certain level of cognitive performance during tasks requiring divided attention by recruiting additional cortical regions that are not normally used for such tasks.  Executive function  Executive functioning is \\"the ability to plan and coordinate a willful action in the face of alternatives, to monitor and update action as necessary and suppress distracting material by focusing attention on the task at hand\\". The prefrontal cortex has been identified as the most important region involved in executive functioning. Researchers believe that three of the most 'basic' executive functions are: shifting, updating, and inhibition. Shifting back and forth between different tasks is considered a very important mental behavior involved in executive functioning as it involves active disengagement from the present task and engaging in a new task.Norman, D. A., & Shallice, T. (1986). Attention to action: Willed and automatic control of behavior. In R. J. Davidson, G. E. Schwartz, & D. Shapiro (Eds.), Consciousness and self- regulation: Advances in research and theory (Vol. 4, pp. 1‚Äì18). New York: Plenum. Updating is believed to be involved in working memory (closely associated with the function of the prefrontal cortexJonides, J., & Smith, E. E. (1997). The architecture of working memory. In M. D. Rugg (Ed.), Cognitive neuroscience (pp. 243‚Äì276). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press), where the information that is active needs to be updated by replacing old, now irrelevant information with new, relevant information based on the objective. Inhibition involves controlled and deliberate impedance of automatic, predominant responses. The anterior cingulate cortex has been implemented in the process of inhibiting a habitual response or detecting possible conflicts in responses; this is shown by the Stroop test. Studies have found that as little as 36 hours of sleep deprivation cause a performance reduction in tasks requiring these executive functions. Frontal lobe. The processes above illustrate a model of controlled versus automatic behavior that was hypothesized by Shallice et al. (1989), called the supervisory attentional system. This system is believed to come into play when intervention of habitual response is necessary. Damage to the prefrontal cortex will cause a breakdown in this system, resulting in utilization behaviors. These behaviors would include spontaneous sequences of action on irrelevant objects in the surroundings with no clear goal in mind. This theory has helped to extend the knowledge we now have on executive functions.  Decision making  Decision making involves a range of executive functions that need to be combined and organized in order to respond in the most appropriate manner, i.e. respond with the most advantageous decision. There are many aspects to the process of decision making, including those discussed above. Other processes involved that correlate to executive function will be discussed below.  Complexity  While most important decisions are made over a longer period of time involving more in-depth cognitive analysis, usually we have limited time in which to assimilate a large amount of information into an informed decision. Lack of sleep appears to negatively affect our ability to appreciate and respond to increasing complexity, as was found in performance deficits after 1 night of sleep deprivation on a simulated marketing game. The game involved subjects promoting a fictional product while getting feedback on the financial effects of their decisions. They would continuously have to take into account new variables to succeed which would increase the game's complexity. Other examples of inability to process complex information includes a decrease in ability to assess facial expressions, an increase in resolving to the use of stereotypes and racial biases in evaluations, and an increase in taking the easier solution to solving interpersonal problems.  Innovation  Intuitively, because sleep deprivation had a negative effect on handling the complexity of the simulated marketing game, it also affected innovative processes as subjects failed to adopt a more innovative (and rewarding) style of play. Innovative thinking involves the construction of new behaviors based on the assimilation of continuously changing or novel information. In a study of military personnel who had undergone two nights of sleep deprivation, results showed marked reductions in the ability to generate ideas about a given topic (categories test); this is known as ideational fluency. Approximate Location of the Orbitofrontal cortex.  Risk  Risk versus reward analysis is an important part of decision making. Attempting to create a representation and response to a risky situation highly involves the orbitofrontal cortex. In a study that involved risk taking analysis of drivers who had been driving for 12 hours straight, it was found that they were more willing to make hazardous maneuvers and were reluctant to adopt any form of a cautious driving style. Some studies shed further light on this phenomenon. One study used real life decision making scenarios involving choosing cards from 1 of 4 decks of cards. Different cards were considered as a reward while the others were a penalty. The sleep deprived subjects failed to alter their selection methods, continuing to choose cards from decks that were producing a high amount of penalty cards, whereas the control subjects were able to change their choosing strategy by a cost-benefit analysis based on monitoring the outcomes they were getting as they went along.  Planning  The process of planning would be done congruently with decision making in determining the outcome behavior. As has been shown so far, sleep deprivation has many detrimental effects on executive functions and planning is not spared. One study involved cadets who were required to complete simulated military operations under sleep deprived conditions. Results showed a decrease in the subjects ability to 'plan on the fly' and overall outcomes were less than those for well rested cadets.McCann, C., Pointing, T. (1995) The effect of alerting drugs on planning performance during sustained operations. Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine, North York, Ontario, Canada. Retrieved onon November 19, 2009 from http://cradpdf.drdc.gc.ca/PDFS/zbb55/p506693.pdf/ Another psychological test used to assess planning and decision making is the Tower of London test. This test has been widely used in the testing of executive functions as well as studies of sleep deprived subjects. In a study examining performance on this test after 45‚Äì50 hours of sleep deprivation, it was found that the sleep deprived subjects not only took longer, but required more moves to complete the task than did the controls.  Error correction  Being able to show insight into one's performance on different tasks and correct or modify those behaviors if they are incorrect is an important part of executive functioning. The problems that could be associated with being unable to learn from a mistake or adapt to a mistake could impair many behaviors. A common test used to assess error correction and trouble shooting with regards to the frontal lobe is the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. This test involves a change in the rules which requires a shift in strategy. In the same study discussed above, detriments were also found on this task in the sleep deprived individuals.  Memory  Research evidence suggests that sleep is involved in the acquisition, maintenance and retrieval of memories as well as memory consolidation. Subsequently, sleep deprivation has been shown to affect both working memory and long-term memory processes.  Working memory  Sleep deprivation increases the number of errors made on working memory tasks. In one study, the working memory task involved illuminating a sequence of 3 or 4 coloured lights, then asking both sleep deprived and non-sleep deprived individuals to memorize and repeat back the sequence. The sleep deprived performed the task much faster than those in the control condition (i.e., not sleep deprived), which initially appeared to be a positive effect. However, there was a significant difference in the number of errors made, with the fatigued group performing much worse. Evidence from imaging studies also demonstrates the influence of sleep deprivation on working memory. EEG studies have documented lower accuracy and slower reaction times among sleep deprived participants performing working memory tasks. Decreasing alertness and lack of focus triggered deficits in working memory that are accompanied by significant degradation of event-related potentials. PET scans shows global decrease in glucose metabolism in response to sleep deprivation. As subjects become increasingly impaired on working memory tasks, a more specific decrease of glucose occurs in the thalamus, prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex. fMRI scans following brief sleep deprivation (24 hours or less) show increases in thalamic activation. Verbal working memory tasks normally cause increases in left temporal lobe activity. However, after 35 hours of deprivation, there are noted decreases in temporal lobe activation and increases in parietal lobe activation. Working memory model. The working memory span is also affected by sleep deprivation. When sleep deprived participants in a study were asked to remember a nonsense word and locate it among a number of similar words, the length of time they could hold it in their working memory decreased by 38% compared to rested individuals.  Long-term memory  One way sleep is involved in the creation of long-term memories is through memory consolidation, which is the process by which a new memory is changed into a more permanent form. This is believed to be accomplished by creating connections between the medial temporal lobes and neocortical areas. NREM (non-REM) and REM sleep are both believed to be implicated, with current theories suggesting NREM is most particularly involved in procedural memory and REM with declarative memory. Animal studies have partly validated these claims. For instance, one study conducted with rats showed that REM sleep deprivation after learning a new task disrupted their ability to perform the task again later. This was especially true if the task was complex (i.e., involved using unusual information or developing novel adaptive behaviours). There is similar evidence for the role of sleep in procedural memory in humans. Participants in one study were trained on a procedural memory skill involving perceptual-motor skills. Those who were NREM sleep deprived performed significantly worse on subsequent trials compared to those who were fully rested. Another study using a visuo-motor procedural memory task documented similar results. Participants who were sleep deprived following the initial training showed no improvement on trials the next day, while those who received sleep showed significant positive changes. Studies such as these clearly demonstrate the disruptive influence sleep deprivation has on memory consolidation of procedural and declarative memories. Sleep deprivation also has a documented effect on the ability to acquire new memories for subsequent consolidation. A study done on mice that were sleep deprived before learning a new skill but allowed to rest afterward displayed a similar number of errors on later trials as the mice that were sleep deprived only after the initial learning. In this case, it is hypothesized that rather than preventing the memory from being consolidated, sleep deprivation interfered with the initial acquisition of the memory. Mice with pre-trial sleep deprivation also took significantly longer to learn a task than well- rested mice. Sleep deprivation is also implicated in impaired ability to retrieve stored long-term memories. When an aversive stimulus was included in a trial (i.e., a blowdryer would blast hot air and noise at a mouse), mice that were sleep deprived were less anxious on subsequent trials. This suggests they had not retrieved all of the memory related to the unpleasant experience.  Explanations for the effect of sleep deprivation on memory  Several theories have been put forth to explain the effect sleep deprivation has on memory. One early study into neurochemical influences on sleep and memory was conducted with cats and demonstrated that sleep deprivation increased brain protein synthesis. There is evidence that these altered levels of proteins could increase the excitability of the central nervous system, thus increasing the susceptibility of the brain to other neurochemical agents that can cause amnesia. Further research has revealed that the protein kinase A (PKA) signalling pathway is crucial to long-term memory. If PKA or protein synthesis inhibition occurs at certain moments during sleep, memory consolidation can be disrupted. In addition, mice with genetic inhibition of PKA have been shown to have long-term memory deficits. Thus, sleep deprivation may act through the inhibition of these protein synthesis pathways. Acetylcholine (ACh) may also be involved in the effects of sleep deprivation, particularly with regards to spatial memory. Muscarinic antagonists, or chemicals that block ACh, impair spatial learning when administered prior to a training task among rats. ACh levels are also found to be lower when measured following a period of sleep deprivation. ACh has also been shown to increase the activity of the PKA pathway, which is needed for memory consolidation. Serotonin levels (in the form of 5-HT) have been shown to decrease during REM and NREM sleep, leading some researchers to believe that it is also involved in memory consolidation during sleep. Mice lacking the receptor gene for 5-HT engage in more REM sleep and perform better on spatial memory tasks. Researchers have hypothesized that sleep deprivation interferes with the normal reduction in levels of 5-HT, impairing the process of memory consolidation. Another theory suggests that the stress brought on by sleep deprivation affects memory consolidation by changing the concentration of corticosteroids in the body. This was simulated in one study by elevating the concentration of glucocorticoids during early sleep stages. The observed effects on memory retention the next day were similar to those obtained from individuals who had received no sleep. Sleep deprivation may affect memory by interfering with neuroplasticity as measured by long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. This reduced plasticity may be the root cause of impairments in both working memory among humans and spatial memory among rats. Sleep deprivation may additionally affect memory by reducing the proliferation of cells in the hippocampus. Sleep deprivation has also been associated with decreased overall membrane excitability of neurons in the brain. Activation of these membranes is critical for the formation of memories. Mitochondria play an essential role in modulating neuron excitability, and research has shown that sleep deprivation is involved in inhibiting mitochondrial metabolism. Practical effects Risk of traffic collisions  Reduced duration of sleep, as well as an increase in time spent awake, are factors that highly contribute to the risk of traffic collisions, the severity and fatality rates of which are on the same level as driving under the influence of alcohol, with 19 hours of wakefulness corresponding to a BAC of 0.05%, and 24 hours of wakefulness corresponding to a BAC of 0.10%. Compounding this issue is the proven dissociation between objective performance and subjective alertness; individuals vastly underestimate the effect that sleep deprivation has on their cognitive performance, particularly during the circadian night. Much of the effect of acute sleep deprivation can be countered by napping, with longer naps giving more benefit than shorter naps. Some industries, particularly the Fire Service, have traditionally allowed workers to sleep while on duty, between calls for service. In one study of EMS providers, 24-hour shifts were not associated with a higher frequency of negative safety outcomes when compared to shorter shifts. This is especially relevant for young adults as they require 8‚Äì9 hours of sleep at night to overcome excessive daytime sleepiness and are among the highest risk group for driving while feeling tired and sleep deprivation related crashes.

Two of his victories were over other aces, Guy Wareing and Ernest Charles Hoy.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/germany/raesch.php Biography Josef Raesch was born in Zewen near Trier on 4 June 1897. The start of World War I sparked his enlistment into the German infantry on 4 August 1914. On 1 December 1917, he transferred from this duty to pilot's training at 'Fliegerersatz-Abteilung (Replacement Detachment) 5.Franks et al 1993, p. 184. After training he was assigned to a reconnaissance unit, Flieger-Abteilung (Flier Detachment) 7, as a two-seater pilot. After seasoning there, he attended Jastaschule (Fighter pilot training), with subsequent posting to a fighter squadron. He joined Jagdstaffel 43 on 6 June 1918. In his June diary entries, he mentioned that rookie pilots posted to the squadron were given older Albatros D.IIIs or Albatros D.Vs to fly, but that newer Fokker D.VIIs were filtering into the unit. The eighth D.VII arrival is noted. Raesch inherited Otto Creutzmann's Fokker D.VII when the latter left the JastaFranks, VanWyngarden 2003, pp. 27-30. on 13 June.Franks et al 1993, p. 94. Creutzmann's insignia of a forward-thrusting pitchfork remained on the plane. For his first aerial victory, Raesch shot down a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a north of Hantay at 1100 hours on 27 June 1918. His diary contained a vivid description: > The Englishmen started to circle, and as soon as I had one in my sights I > opened up with a volley from both guns, whereupon the SE 5 went into a > vertical climb and then slipped off into a spin, with me closely on his > tail. I let him have a second burst, and I could see my tracers entering his > cockpit and engine and finally had to pull away to avoid a collision. I > spotted my victim some 300 meters below me....I dived and again opened up > with both guns. The SE 5 went into a climb, and now I could see the machine > was on fire. The machine spun towards the earth in a tower of fire and > finally crashed. On 1 July, he scored again, downing a Sopwith Camel. One week later, he shot down another SE.5a over Nieppe Wood for his third confirmed victory. The Summer weather became so hot that the German phosphorus ammunition for machine guns would sometimes \\"cook off\\"; according to Raesch's diary, Jasta 43 lost a pilot to that catastrophe on 16 July. He also noted such ersatz war materials as iron bullets for brass, and wooden landing gear wheels being supplied. On 25 July, he lost a combat at 1800 hours; Lieutenant Ivan Frank Hind flying SE.5a C5358 shot Raesch down in flames, using Buckingham incendiary ammunition. The bullets narrowly missed Raesch's head, but a burst of flame struck him in the face. Although having had a parachute for only the past fortnight, in one of the pioneering wartime jumps, Raesch baled out and reached ground alive but facially singed. He had to yank his chute from its container in midair to do so. Then a two-meter hole had burned the 'chute. The chute was repaired and reissued to save another pilot's life. Raesch was temporarily relegated to piloting a Pfalz D.XII before regaining a Fokker D.VII. He had become the de facto squadron leader, as he usually led the aerial combat patrols. In August 1918, Jasta 43 was hampered by shortages of fuel and aircraft. Raesch's diary remarks that the squadron could not fly because it had no serviceable aircraft. Raesch would not score again until 1750 hours on 28 September 1918, when he shot down a flight commander from No. 29 Squadron RAF, Ernest Charles Hoy. Flying ace Hoy survived the crash of his Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a east of Ypres, but was captured by German ground troops. Raesch would not score again until 26 October, when he sent down a SE.5a over Velennes, France. The following day at 1030 hours, he shot down another flight commander from 29 Squadron, Captain Guy Wareing. Wareing's body and aircraft wreckage landed east of Tournai. On 30 October 1918, Raesch was credited with his final victory, an unidentified enemy aircraft. Raesch's victory tally had reached six enemy fighter planes, plus the unknown craft. On 2 November 1918, Josef Raesch was awarded the First Class Iron Cross, to join the Second Class one awarded earlier. Nine days later, the fighting ended. Nothing more is known of Josef Raesch, except that as late as 1967, he was known to be working as a machine tool manufacturer. Sources of information References * Norman Franks, Frank W.

Yeung's publications appear in top scientific journals and include topics such as parental investment in children, work and family balance, ethnic disparities in educational attainment, poverty, and family wealth. Her most cited work includes those that address the impact of economic stress on families and the fatherhood issues. She has served on the editorial board for the Journal of Marriage and Family and Child Development and on numerous scientific review committees for the government. Her international experiences also include advising on large-scale longitudinal surveys in Asia, Europe, and Australia and to the United Nations. Major research projects  Panel study of income dynamics  Yeung is a co-principal investigator of the PSID, one of the longest-running nationally representative study of American families that was initiated in 1968. The study has a genealogical design that follows the original family members and their grown children when they establish their independent households. The PSID is one of the richest data archives in the social science history, with its contents including economic, demographic, health, education and child development data about American families. As of 2009, 37 waves of the PSID data, containing more than 50,000 variables, were assembled from more than 8,000 families and nearly 70,000 individuals. China's economic transition and children's well-being This project examines the relationship between industrialization and children's well beings measured by education and child mortality in China. Our analysis is based on micro census data collected in 1982, 1990, and 2000 and various industrial surveys. These data allow us to control for year and county fixed effects. Intergenerational stratification on children's achievement This research investigates factors contributing to the substantial achievement gaps in high school children. Yeung and Persell focus on four important clusters of factors: (1) intergenerational resources, 2) family interactions, 3) racial inequalities in students' school and neighborhoods, and 4) how racial inequalities in various contexts interact with one another to affect children's cognitive abilities. The analysis is based on longitudinal data on family histories from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and its Child Development Supplements conducted in 1997 and 2003 as well as on geographic information from census data and school district data over the last three decades. Childhood consumption and children's education and emotional well- being This research is supported by funding from the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development to support work in American fathers' involvement with children. The goals of this project are (1) to describe how paternal involvement with children, in the form of time, financial and psychological resources, differ by family structure, (2) to test hypotheses about factors that affect paternal involvement behavior, and (3) to investigate how children's psychological and cognitive well-being relates to fathers' attitudes and involvement behavior. The research will be based on data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), which contains annual data collected since 1968 for a nationally representative sample of American households. Using longitudinal history in the PSID and data from the 1997 Child Development Supplement, this project will assess the extent to which social and economic involvement with children varies with fathers' changing life circumstances. Paternal involvement and child well-being This research is supported by funding from the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development to support work in American fathers' involvement with children. The goals of this project are (1) to describe how paternal involvement with children, in the form of time, financial and psychological resources, differ by family structure, (2) to test hypotheses about factors that affect paternal involvement behavior, and (3) to investigate how children's psychological and cognitive well-being relates to fathers' attitudes and involvement behavior. The research will be based on data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), which contains annual data collected since 1968 for a nationally representative sample of American households. Using longitudinal history in the PSID and data from the 1997 Child Development Supplement, this project will assess the extent to which social and economic involvement with children varies with fathers' changing life circumstances. Caring for elderly parents The National Institute of Aging has funded collaboration between Wei-Jun Jean Yeung and Martha Hill in University of Michigan to examine responses of baby-boom children to the health care needs of their elderly parents and how these responses compare to those of earlier cohorts. Intergenerational transfers to ailing parents are central to this investigation, and a primary interest is in gauging the extent to which changes in children's labor market participation are engendered by providing those transfers. Using a national sample of baby-boomers, both leading edge (born 1945-54) and trailing edge (born 1955-64), and prior cohorts with elderly parents, the analysis aims at examining differences across these groups in terms of: level and type of transfers, actual changes in work hours (short-run and long run), extent to which transfers engendered changes in work hours, and how individual histories of social, economic and demographic circumstances and behaviors relate to these outcomes. Long-term trends in U.S. poverty and welfare dependence With funding received from the National Science Foundation, this project examines the long-term trends of poverty and welfare receipts in U.S. Yeung documented the duration and patterns of poverty and welfare receipt for multiple cohorts of individuals in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, by different individual and family characteristics such as ethnicity, marital status, and age of the household head. The project also examines intergenerational correlation between childhood poverty and young adult achievement such as educational attainment and welfare status. Parts of the results from this project were used to support the production of the annual report on the indicators of poverty and welfare dependence by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. Wealth and health: race, assets and child development Yeung and Dalton Conley received a research grant from the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development to examine the link between parental wealth and young children's physical and mental well-being. We intend to investigate how family net worth may mediate or modify the race - child outcome association. The mechanism through which family wealth influences children's health and achievements will be a focus of this study. We will make advantage of data collected in a series of supplemental files to Panel Study of Income Dynamics, including the 1997 Child Development Supplement and family wealth data collected in the years 1984, 1989, 1994, 1999 and 2001. Private life She is married to Bernard Yeung, a professor in Business Administration. They have two children.

After the war, he entered politics as a Conservative, serving as a Member of Parliament (MP) for periods between 1922 and 1945.  Early life  Cunningham-Reid was born in Wayland, Norfolk, the son of the Reverend Arthur Morse Reid and his wife Agnes Celina Flower (1861‚Äì1941), a sister of Archibald Dennis Flower. He joined the Royal Engineers during the First World War and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant, transferring to the Royal Flying Corps. In August 1918, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, the citation reading:  Political career  At the 1922 general election, Cunningham-Reid stood as the conservative candidate in Warrington, a Conservative-held borough constituency in Lancashire where the sitting member Sir Harold Smith was retiring. He won the seat with a comfortable majority in a two-way contest with the Labour Party candidate. However, at the next general election, in 1923, the addition of a Liberal Party candidate saw him lose to Labour's Charles Dukes. The Liberals in Warrington did not field a candidate at the 1924 general election, and Reid was returned to the House of Commons for the next five years. At the 1929 election he did not stand in Warrington, but instead sought election in Southampton. This was a two-seat constituency, where both the sitting members were Conservatives not seeking re-election. Having returned only Conservatives since 1922, this might have been regarded as safer Conservative territory than Warrington, but Labour won both seats.Craig, op. cit. page 243 Cunningham- Reid's next chance to return to the Commons came in 1932, when the Conservative member Sir Rennell Rodd resigned from Parliament. This caused a by-election in his inner London constituency of St Marylebone, where Cunningham-Reid was adopted as the candidate of the St Marylebone Conservative and Constitutional Union, which was the official Conservative and Unionist organisation in the area. However, a number of local Conservatives who opposed his adoption left to form the rival St Marylebone Conservative Association and nominated their own candidate, Sir B. P Blackett. It was customary for the Conservative Party leader (then Stanley Baldwin) to send a letter of support to the party's candidate, but both Blackett and Cunningham-Reid each claimed to be the official Conservative nominee, and Baldwin did not endorse either of them. No other candidates were nominated, so the election became a two-way contest between the rival Conservatives.Craig, op. cit., page 43 In the event, Cunningham-Reid won the seat with a slender majority of 1,013 (4.6% of the votes), and held it for a further thirteen years. At the 1935 general election he was returned as the sole Conservative candidate with a huge majority over his Labour opponent. In 1943 the St Marylebone Conservative and Constitutional Union was disaffiliated from the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations in favour of the rival St Marylebone Conservative Association, which had remained in existence since the 1932 split. At the 1945 general election, Cunningham-Reid retained the support of the Conservative and Constitutional Union, but was opposed by Wavell Wakefield, a former captain of the England national rugby union team, who received the Conservative Association's endorsement. Without official party support, Cunningham-Reid fared poorly, finishing third with only 11% of the votes. Wavell won the seat with a comfortable majority over the second-placed Labour candidate.  In Parliament  On 28 July 1943, Cunningham-Reid was involved in an exchange of blows in the lobby of the House of Commons with fellow Conservative MP Oliver Locker-Lampson. Cunningham-Reid's description of the incident was that after a verbal dispute, The following day, both MPs made a formal apology in the House of Commons. On 30 July Cunningham-Reid made a personal statement in which he explained to the House that the matter had arisen after Locker-Lampson had accused him of leaving London during The Blitz, whereas he claimed to have departed on a 14-week trip before The Blitz started. The incident became front-page news in Britain, and was reported in several major American newspapers ‚Äî including the Los Angeles Times, which ran the story under the headline \\"England Grins as Members of Commons Trade Punches\\".  Personal life  Cunningham-Reid was married twice. His first marriage, on 12 May 1927, was to Hon. Ruth Mary Clarisse Ashley (1906‚Äì1986), daughter of Lt.-Col. Wilfrid William Ashley, 1st and last Baron Mount Temple and Amalia Mary Maud Cassel, a multimillionaire. The couple, described by The Cincinnati Enquirer as \\"England's wealthiest girl and handsomest man\\", had two children: Michael Duncan Alec Cunningham-Reid (1928‚Äì2014)http://peeragenews.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/michael-duncan-alec- cunningham-reid.html and Noel Robert Cunningham-Reid (1930‚Äì2017).https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/peerage-news/-N3IHXP-TYw On their honeymoon, she insisted that they share her wealth because \\"no decent woman likes to have a man live with her in charity\\", but when the couple divorced in 1940, he sued for half of her $400,000 annual income. In 1944 Cunningham-Reid married secondly Angela Williams, and they were divorced about 1949. During the Second World War he conducted an affair with the American heiress Doris Duke.  Death  Cunningham-Reid died in Valbonne, France, on 26 March 1977.

In the game, Aladdin, Abu and Jasmine fight against Jafar's sister Nasira who wants to bring him back to life. Nasira's Revenge received generally average reviews. Gameplay The player assumes control of three characters in the game: Aladdin, Abu, and Jasmine. Aladdin's abilities range from sword fighting to jumping to stomping. Abu can jump, roll, and climb on walls to a certain degree. Jasmine's character is hiding in a pot for her level therefore the player can hide and hop. The player collects gold coins throughout each level and fights a variety of villains. The game's environments vary and allow interaction. There are minigames at the end of each level: pie throwing, surfing, skateboarding, and cloud jumping. Plot Disney's Aladdin in Nasira's Revenge is set after the events of The Return of Jafar, during the television series and before Aladdin and the King of Thieves. Agrabah is in peril again, this time threatened by the evil sorceress Nasira (Jodi Benson). The evil witch Nasira begins her plot by taking over the palace with a spell and kidnapping Jasmine (Linda Larkin) and the Sultan (Val Bettin). She then commands the guard's captain Razoul (Jim Cummings) to bring Aladdin (Scott Weinger) to her dead or alive. Nasira believes that if she collects a set of ancient relics that are spread all over Agrabah she might be able to revive her brother Jafar (Jonathan Freeman) and take over the world, and so she uses her captives to force Aladdin into doing this job for her. The game ends with Nasira resurrecting Jafar in her volcanic lair, but Aladdin manages to smash the artifacts and destroy him once again while Nasira herself flees and apparently survives. Reception David Chen reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"A nicely made game ‚Äì on the easy side, but perfect for kids.\\" Reception of the game was mixed or average, as GameRankings gave the PlayStation version a score of 65% while Metacritic gave it a score of 61 out of 100.

She also starred in Harper Valley PTA as Wanda Reilly Taylor. Early life Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Hanley is the daughter of Leland Hanley, an All-American football player at Northwestern University and United States Marine Corps veteran, and Doris \\"Dorie\\" Hanley (n√©e Nihlroos). She has an older sister Mary Jo and a younger sister Molly. The family moved to Edmonds, Washington, north of Seattle, when Bridget was 4. After graduating from Edmonds High School, Hanley headed to the San Francisco College for Women to study drama for two years then on to University of Washington where she graduated with honors and a B.A. in drama, having appeared in 17 major productions, ranging from Shakespeare to Arthur Miller. Career Early career Hanley began her acting career in San Francisco, where she worked days as a secretary in an advertising agency for $50 a week while auditioning for roles in repertory theater.Durslag, Melvin. (1969, May 10‚Äì16). She plays 'Candy' - with a difference/Bridget Hanley's character in 'Here Come the Brides' projects a wholesome, virtuous image, and she's just the one to fill the bill. TV GUIDE, pp 21-24. When she landed the lead female role of Robin in a touring company production of Under the Yum Yum Tree, her weekly salary doubled. She played Robin for almost four years in theaters in San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles and Hollywood until Screen Gems signed her to a contract in 1966. Screen Gems' publicity materials described Hanley as a \\"young Maureen O'Hara.\\" Hanley's first credited TV role was in the sitcom Hank in 1965. She played Terry in the episode \\"My Fair Co-Ed\\". That was followed by credited appearances on numerous Screen Gems television series, including Gidget, The Farmer's Daughter, Love on a Rooftop, Bewitched, I Dream of Jeannie and The Flying Nun. While working at Screen Gems, Hanley met director/producer E. W. Swackhamer, whom she later married. She also made several pilots for Screen Gems, including her first lead role in the series Here Come the Brides. Here Come the Brides Hanley played the female lead role of Candy Pruitt in the series Here Come the Brides, which premiered on September 25, 1968. According to the show's producers in an interview with L.A. Times TV critic Cecil Smith, it was inspired by the movie Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, and was loosely based upon the transportation of single women from the East Coast to what was then the frontier logging outpost of Seattle. The show's theme song, \\"Seattle,\\" was recorded by Perry Como, who enjoyed some chart success with it. Hanley's character was the love interest of Jeremy Bolt, played by then teen heartthrob Bobby Sherman; Sherman's interpretation of \\"Seattle\\" was not as successful as Como's version had been. Harper Valley PTA Harper Valley PTA was an early 1980s American television sitcom based on the 1978 film Harper Valley PTA, which was in turn based on the 1968 song recorded by country music singer Jeannie C. Riley, written by Tom T. Hall. It's the story of Stella Johnson, a door-to-door saleswoman (Barbara Eden), a single mother living in the fictional town of Harper Valley, Ohio who is trying to make ends meet and raise her daughter Dee, following the loss of her husband. The PTA of Harper Valley Junior High School, egged on by its socialite president, Flora Simpson Reilly (Anne Francine), took a dim view of Mrs. Johnson's flouting of the small town's conventions. Hanley played Wanda Reilly Taylor, a member of the snooty family that tried to rule Harper Valley. Later career Hanley continues to be an active performer at Theatre West, an internationally acclaimed non-profit arts organization in Hollywood, California. Established in 1962, Theatre West is the oldest continually running theatre company in Los Angeles. She appeared in an episode of the TV series Murder, She Wrote as the wife of a serial cheating husband. Middletown Productions has created and produced May Day Sermon, an award-winning one-woman show based on the poem by James Dickey. \\"Bronwen, the Traw and the Shapeshifter\\" is a more recent theatrical offering performed by Hanley, also based on a James Dickey poem Hanley has been a guest lecturer and performer at Radford University. Personal life Hanley married Egbert Warndrink (E. W.) Swackhamer, Jr., a producer and director of Here Come the Brides, on April 26, 1969. Together they had two daughters, Bronwyn and Megan. Swackhamer died in 1994. Along with family and community members, Hanley led a drive to save the Ganahl-Hanley log cabin in Edmonds, Washington, which was moved next to the historical museum in downtown Edmonds.

He was credited with seven confirmed aerial victories flying for Italian aviation during the war; however, his pioneering civil aviation activities both before and immediately following the war were probably even more important than his martial career. Pre-World War I activities He was born in Italy as Cosimo Rennella on 15 February 1890, but in 1892, the toddler accompanied his family when they emigrated to Guayaquil, Ecuador. While there, his name was Latinized into Cosimo Rennella Barbatto by appending his mother's maiden name, though he was usually called \\"Cosme\\". In 1909, he volunteered to serve in the Patria I Battalion in military operations against Peru. In 1911, Rennella persuaded a local sportsman's club, the Club Guayas de Tiro Aviacion (Guayas Shooting and Aviation Club), to sponsor his pilot's training; his aim was to be the first flier in Ecuador. The club underwrote Rennella's journey to Pau, France to learn to fly. There the young tyro became a pilot using French Bl√©riot military aircraft. He finally qualified for his civil pilot's license at Turin's Chiribiri flying school on 24 August 1912. Following that, he accompanied a pair of Nieuportish monoplanes back across the Atlantic to Panama. By the time Rennella and his two traveling companions returned to Central America with an aircraft, the first flight in Ecuador, which was by Chilean Lieutenant Eduardo Molina Lav√≠n, had taken place in their absence. Rennella's new aircraft was a copy of a French Nieuport, built by Navaro and Valgoi of Torino, Italy. On 15 December 1912, having been forbidden to fly across the Isthmus of Panama by U. S. officials, he flew an unauthorized flight in this aircraft over Panama City, leafletting the town with fliers thanking the populace for their support of his flight, in may have been the first aerial pamphlet drop in history. In the middle of January 1913, he was welcomed home in Ecuador. Once there, he accepted the obligation of returning to Italy for more training while he supervised the manufacture of a Chiribiri monoplane for his Club sponsors. He brought this aircraft, dubbed Patria No. I, back to Ecuador. He used his time in Italy to somehow qualify for an Italian military pilot's license, which was granted at Turin on 25 July 1913. Rennella was back in Ecuador by 29 September 1913. On 8 October 1913, at Guayaquil, Cosimo Rennella became the first Ecuadorian citizen to fly in his own nation. A follow-up exhibition scheduled for the 19th dwindled away amid controversy over potential gate receipts. Rennella may have briefly served in the Ecuadorian military before barnstorming in Peru, Chile, and Mexico; he founded a flying school in the latter. Italy's 24 May 1915 entry into World War I sparked his July return to Italy, where he begged the War Ministry to allow him to volunteer to fly for them. World War I Rennella entered aviation training in Pisa on 17 September 1915. He qualified as a Farman student on 1 February 1916. On 6 February, he transferred to training at Busto Aristo. In April, he moved to Turin to qualify on the more advanced Maurice Farman 14. Finally, rated as a Caporal, he was posted to duty with a reconnaissance squadron, 31a Squadriglia on 14 April 1916. He flew his first combat sortie the next day. He transferred twice more to other reconnaissance squadrons--48a Squadriglia on 1 May, 45a Squadriglia on 12 July 1916. He survived an enemy attack on his aircraft on 6 August. On 31 August, he was promoted to Sergente. Rennella served as a pilot flying two-seaters until 23 June 1917, when he passed the physical examination to become a fighter pilot. He reported to Malpensa for training, and qualified on a Nieuport 11 on 7 August. On the 9th, he began gunnery training at Pisa. On 14 August 1917, he reported to 78a Squadriglia. Between 24 September 1917 and 31 August 1918, as he flew with 78a Squadriglia of the Corpo Aeronautico Militare, he scored seven confirmed aerial victories, having 11 other claims go unconfirmed. He began his string of victories flying a Nieuport 17, but re- equipped with a Hanriot HD.1. As his victories mounted, he wrote letters home to the Ecuadorian press describing his experiences. Post World War I The Bongiovanni military intelligence commission released its report on aerial victories on 1 February 1919; seven of Rennella's victory claims were verified. By the time Rennella reportedly left the Corpo Aeronautico Militare in March 1919, he had been honored with two awards of the Silver Medal of Military Valor and the War Merit Cross from Italy, the French Croix de guerre, and the Belgian Croix de guerre. Rennella returned to South America in early 1920. In February 1920, Rennella was involved in a local business enterprise at La Guaira, Venezuela. On February 27, he flew a Hanriot HD.1 fighter at Caracas. The next day, Rennella flew from Caracas to Maracay. Continuing his operations through March, he subsequently pioneered inter-urban flights in Venezuela; he also flew at least one airmail flight. He is sometimes mistakenly credited with the first Venezuelan military flight because he used a war surplus fighter for his flights. However, he is credited with establishing a flying school at Maracay. Rennella returned to his native Ecuador in 1924 to join its fledgling air force as a Capitano. In August 1932, he would fly the Ecuadorian Air Force's first operational missions. In August 1934, he was awarded Ecuador's Order of Abdon Calder√≥n, Second Class. He was subsequently promoted to major. In early 1937, Cosimo Rennella traveled to a convention of World War I aces in Dayton, Ohio. Upon his return, he was admitted to the military hospital in Quito with pneumonia. He died there on 3 May 1937. He was posthumously promoted to lieutenant colonel.

They range from the Canadian Atlantic provinces, excluding Newfoundland and Labrador, to Manitoba and North Dakota south to West Virginia and Ohio. They can often be seen in bogs, meadows and almost anywhere else its host plant occurs. The typical elevations for this species range from 0 to 1,742 feet (531 m). It is listed as a species of special concern and believed extirpated in the US state of Connecticut.\\"Connecticut's Endangered, Threatened and Special Concern Species 2015\\".

She does not discriminate between classes, for she dupes a nobleman, a bourgeois and a clergyman into believing that they are the father of her son, whom she conceived on purpose because she felt that they were no longer paying her enough attention. All three men lavish her and her son with gifts to the point of ruining themselves. Her son, Samson, grows up with all of the privileges that money can buy. Bored by his surroundings, he boasts to his mother that his education is complete for he can easily lead any woman into his bed and, subsequently, into the whorehouse. His mother ridicules him and warns him of the treacherous ways of women. Slighted, Samson claims that no woman will ever make a fool of him and heads out into the world. Along his journeys, he conquers women of all nations and cheats men at dice, even becoming a monk at Clairvaux Abbey for a brief period of time. After twelve years of deflowering, pimping and dicing, he returns to his mother's hometown. Although he does not recognize her, she knows him and sets out to prove wrong his last boast to her. She tricks him into believing that Herselot, her faithful servant, is a young virgin whom he could never convince to go to bed with him. Intent upon proving her incorrect, he sets out to triumph over the unconquerable and believes to have succeeded. During the act however, he discovers that she is no more a virgin than he is. In the meantime, Richeut convinces seven men of her acquaintance to beat her son, but not kill him. Before Samson can leave Herselot's bed, the men beat him with Richeut intervening, pretending to save him from these men. His boast of twelve years earlier has thus been proven wrong.Horton, Ingrid D. Engendering Vice: The Exemplarity of the Old French Fabliaux. Diss. U. of Kansas, 2007. Ann Arbor: UMI, 2008.

During 1918, Risztics formed a strong friendship with fellow pilots Fredrich Hefty and Ferdinand Udvardy. Amongst the airmen of Flik 42J, the trio became known as the Arany Triumviratus (Golden Triumvirate). Risztics marked both sides of his Albatros D.III with the number \\"8\\", Udvardy with the number \\"7\\", and Hefty with the number \\"6\\".http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/austrhun/risztics.php World Record Flights of the W33 In the late 1920s, he was well known for his record flights for the Junkers W 33. On July 5, 1927, Junkers pilots Risztics and Zimmermann achieved a new world record for continuous flight with a W33L of 65hrs and 25 minutes. Risztics and Edzard achieved the next W33 world record on August 3, 1927 with a W33. They flew for a distance of 4660 km a new distance world record, and needed 52hrs and 22 minutes for that flight. First try of the east-west Atlantic crossing On August, 14th 1927, Risztics, Edzard and the American journalist Hubert Renfro Knickerbocker on board the Junkers W 33 \\"Europa\\", and Koehl, Loose and Huenefeld with the W 33 \\"Bremen\\", took off from Germany for the first approach of the crossing. This approach failed due to bad weather and engine troubles of \\"Europa\\". The Challenge 1929-1930 Risztics took part at International Touring Aircraft Contests, the Challenge 1929 and the Challenge 1930. The contest was conceived by the French Aero Club, inspired by the International Light Aircraft Contest in France in 1928. Four Challenges, from 1929 to 1934, were major aviation events in pre-war Europe. The first contest was opened on August 4, 1929 in Paris. It consisted of two parts: technical trials of aircraft and a rally over Europe. Since one of the aims of the Challenge was to generate a progress in aircraft building, it was not only pilots' competition, but technical trials also included a construction evaluation. Fifty-five aircraft entered the Challenge in 1929, from six countries. All planes flew with two-men crews, pilot and passenger or mechanic. Johann Risztics was 8th after the technical trials with his Junkers A50. However, just at the beginning of a rally over Europe, on 7 August 1929, he broke undercarriage and propeller and was disqualified. He continued the rally off the contest, till Milano.

Germany organized the contest, because the German pilot Fritz Morzik won the previous contest in 1929. Sixty aircraft entered the Challenge in 1930, from six countries. The contest was open on July 16, 1930, at Berlin-Staaken airfield. It consisted of two parts: a rally over Europe and technical trials. Risztics finished the rally on the 16th position and all the contest on the 15th position, flying Junkers A50ce.

The 195th overall episode of the series, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 18, 2009. In the episode, the boys visit Pi Pi's Splashtown, the local waterpark, where so many people urinate in the pools to the point that the entire park becomes engulfed in tsunamis of urine. The episode was written and directed by series co- creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. \\"Pee\\" served as a parody of the disaster film genre, particularly the movie 2012 which was released five days before \\"Pee\\" was broadcast. According to Nielsen ratings, the finale episode was seen by 2.87 million households, making it the highest rated cable show of the night. The episode received generally mixed reviews. Plot One summer day, Cartman, and his friends, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Butters and Jimmy arrive at Pi Pi's Splashtown, the local waterpark. Cartman is distraught to discover that most of the park's attendants are people of different races, while Kyle is incredibly repulsed to learn so many people freely urinate in the pools. Based on his observance of more minorities at the park than white people, Cartman calculates there will be no white people left by the year 2012, and interprets this as a sign that Mayans accurately predicted the world would end the same year, and that the new world will be \\"made up of minorities.\\" Annoyed by Cartman's \\"racism\\", Kyle points out that since white people do not make up the majority of the park's attendance, then they are the new minority, but Cartman refuses to believe it, ignorantly thinking that a minority is someone who is \\"black or brown.\\" At the same time, Kyle walks by an elderly man and woman and finds out that the man peed in the pool, which disgusts Kyle. A bespectacled male scientist tests the park's water and discovers it is 98% urine. He urges Pi Pi, the park's Venetian owner, to immediately close and evacuate his park, claiming the high urine content will soon trigger a cataclysmic event. Pi Pi dismisses the warning. But when a little girl relieves herself in a wave pool, the park is overcome and destroyed by tsunamis of yellow urine and volcanic eruptions. Hundreds of people drown in the subsequent flood, including Kenny, but the other boys manage to survive. The destroyed park is quarantined, and the scientist advises against a mission to rescue those trapped inside, fearing their exposure to \\"pee contamination\\" has turned them into dangerous, hate-filled mutants. To prove his theory, the scientist urinates onto a test monkey, which clearly becomes annoyed and enraged. An antidote to this reaction is then tested on other monkeys, but proven unsuccessful when the monkeys still become angered when urinated on. Meanwhile, Cartman clings to debris to stay afloat, while the other boys have reached higher ground. Cartman is rescued by the occupants of an inflatable raft from a water park ride. Noticing he is the only white person in the raft, Cartman assumes he is the \\"last of his species,\\" and that his envisioned 2012 scenario has occurred three years early. He imagines a world in which he must speak in minority slang, is paid lower wages, and eventually forced to live in a concentration camp. The other boys find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the inundation if someone can swim through the pee to reach an emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees to do the job as he said at the start of the episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are (in his opinion) \\"more disgusting\\" than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration. Production Trey Parker wrote and directed the episode \\"Pee\\", the South Park thirteenth season finale, was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated [TV-MA) in the United States. Since the episode takes place in a waterpark, all animation had to be drawn from scratch. The episode was conceived a mere week before its initial broadcast, and the animation was almost completely unfinished two days before airing. Parker and Matt Stone had the idea of a waterpark-themed episode for a long time and reminisced about Water World in Denver, Colorado during the episode's production. Initially, the name of the park in the episode was Pi Pi's Urine World. \\"Pee\\" first aired on November 18, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. The episode marked the third time during the thirteenth season that Kenny was killed, a running gag throughout the series. He also died during the season premiere, \\"The Ring\\" and during \\"W.T.F.\\" During one of the final scenes, an alien holding a banana is visible among the crowd in the background. The alien was placed in the episode as part of a contest offered by the show's official website, in which viewers who could find and identify the alien in the episode could enter a contest, with the winner getting an animated version of himself or herself placed in the South Park opening credits. The episode featured a musical number sung by Cartman in which he despairs over the number of minorities at the waterpark. He also reminisces about the park before the ride instructions were also read in Spanish. The day after \\"Pee\\" was originally broadcast, three different kinds of T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts based on the episode were made available on South Park Studios, the official website of South Park. One featured Butters standing next to a puddle of urine saying, \\"1 in 3 People Admit They Pee in Pools\\". The second included Cartman and his quote from the episode, \\"Your world is cold and void of any humanity\\". The third featured Stan, Cartman, Kyle and Kenny wearing bathing suits and standing in front of a Pi Pi's Splashtown logo. Cultural references The episode is a parody on the disaster film genre, which has been parodied in previous South Park episodes, like \\"Pandemic\\", the twelfth season parody of the film Cloverfield. \\"Pee\\" included a particularly large number of references to 2012, a science fiction film about the end of the world as predicted by the Mayan calendar, which was released only days before \\"Pee\\" was originally broadcast. The episode parodies many common elements of such disaster films, including scientists struggling to figure out the source of the problem. The destruction of rides and park amenities by the tsunami of urine is a reference to the destruction of historical monuments in 2012, and other such disaster films by Roland Emmerich, the director of, White House Down, 2012, Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow. \\"Pee\\" also includes several references to the 2012 phenomenon, the prediction that cataclysmic events would occur in the year 2012, which is said to be the end of the Mayan Long Count calendar. The scene in which Kyle is forced to drink three cups of urine in order to prevent his body from enduring the effects of fluid pressure before swimming down to drain it all out, is a parody of a scene in the 1989 film The Abyss, where the protagonist inhales a liquid breathing medium before venturing into the ocean depths. There is also a reference to the film Alive (1993) when Randy comes to rescue the children on a helicopter. He is holding a red baby shoe, just as Nando Parrado at the end of the movie. Reception In its original American broadcast on November 18, 2009, \\"Pee\\" was watched by 2.87 million overall households, according to the Nielsen ratings, making it the most watched cable show of the night. It beat the second highest-ranked cable show, Bravo's Top Chef, by about 600,000 households. The episode received generally mixed reviews. If Magazine writer Carl Cortez, who was critical of the second half of season thirteen, said \\"Pee\\" ranked as one of the best episodes of the season, and said it included several \\"classic South Park moments\\". Cortez called it a \\"wonderfully twisted spoof\\" of disaster films and called the script \\"pretty biting stuff ... without being wholly offensive\\". Ramsey Isler of IGN said the emergency staff subplot working on a cure was not \\"quite perfect parody\\". But he praised Kyle in the ending scene, as well as the way South Park found a new, literal twist on \\"toilet humor\\" by featuring rivers and tsunamis of pee. Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club said that the episode was overly offensive, rather than an ironic commentary on racism. Although O'Neal said previous South Park episodes like \\"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\\" were effective, \\"Pee\\" and its references to minority park attendees and the Italian waterpark owner \\"came off less like ironic racism and more as good, old-fashioned, butter-your-cornbread-with-it racism\\". An airing on August 4, 2017 featured a muffled version of the song. Home release \\"Pee\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park's thirteenth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on March 16, 2010. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode, a collection of deleted scenes, and a special mini-feature Inside Xbox: A Behind-the-Scenes Tour of South Park Studios, which discussed the process behind animating the show with Inside Xbox host Major Nelson.

They are mainly worn as a fashion statement for the subculture of cybergoth. Mixed with both influences from America and the United Kingdom's versions of techno and other electronic music, cybergoths tend to dress in bright colors, neon lights, lots of plastic, loud, or costume jewelry known as \\"kandi\\" and one of the most essential items is fake hair. Synthetic dreads or falls are most commonly seen in the cybergoth and cyberpunk fashion and are easily accessorized with LED threads of light, yarn, wool, tubed crin, (more commonly known as Cyberlocks), beads and more. Categories of Synthetic Dreads  Dread Extensions  Dread extensions can be braided, sewn, or wrapped into natural hair. With proper maintenance extensions can last up to four months, sometimes longer depending on how fast the hair grows and creates looseness at the scalp. Dread extensions come in single and double ended. Single ended means the synthetic hair is created with the loop on the top so that natural hair can slide through and then be braided or wrapped onto the dread, then tied off with a rubber band or thread. Double ended is twice the length of a single and folded in half to create the look of \\"two dreads in one.\\" Only one half of the dread is braided or wrapped into the hair while the other half hangs loose, giving a more realistic appearance because there is no braid at the top on half of the set.  Dread Falls  Dread Falls are single ended dreads looped onto a piece of lace or elastic. Falls are attached by pony tail or pigtail and range from short to long, and they are easily customizable. They are worn and removed with no damage or strain on natural hair. Many other materials can be used in either dreads or extensions such as tubed crin (cyberlocks), beads, yarn, fiber optic string lights, flat plastic in neon colors, etc. Some sets can be made entirely from wool. Wool dreads give a similar look to real dreads and are very soft. Wool can range in many colors that cannot be recreated in synthetic hair, and therefore they give a certain appeal to cybergoths who tend to coordinate with a variety of colors.  Dread Styles  There are many different styles of dreads. Solid Coloured Dreads are made from a single coloured fibre. Candycane Dreads are made using two or more colours twisted together to give a candycane effect. Blended Dreads are made from a blend of different colours to create a more subtle tone. Transitional Dreads start in one colour and end with the tip being another colour. Natural Style Dreads are made from the same synthetic materials but resemble natural dreadlocks.

He became the Head Chorister of that choir and even had a solo at the wedding of Prince Andrew and Miss Sarah Ferguson. He attended the University of Cambridge where he read Geography and captained the rugby team to an unprecedented 2-12 season on the basis of his significant height advantage. It was at university that he developed a love for the fashion style later coined \\"Athleisure.\\" Career He held the second baritone position in the King's Singers for eight years, from 1996 to 2004, including a Grammy nomination for Best Classical Crossover Album in 2001. He has also performed and recorded with Polyphony, Tenebrae, and The Cambridge Singers, among others.

His father Shashibhushan Bandyopadhyay was a Sheristadar (keeper of records) in the district court in Tripura. He spent his childhood in Dhaka where he studied at Dhaka Collegiate School. When he was in school, he started bodybuilding at the akhara of Adhar Ghosh at Lakshmibazar, Dhaka. Later he wanted to be a soldier, but he was barred from entering into the British Indian Army. After that he was appointed the bodyguard of Maharaja Bir Chandra Manikya Bahadur of Tripura. Later he left the job and joined Barishal Zilla School as a gymnasium trainer. Soon he left that job and started a circus. For 17 years Shyama Kanta entertained audience across Bengal and Bihar with his tiger wrestling acts. In 1899, he left home to become a monk. He was initiated by Nabin Chandra Chakrabarti Tibbetibaba, a Vedantic monk who renamed Shyama Kanta as ‚Ä≥Soham Swami‚Ä≥. Soham Swami set up his hermitage at Bhawali near Nainital in modern- day Uttarakhand, India. He followed the spiritual path of Advaita or non- dualism and was a staunch critic of religious bigotry and superstitions. The last book written by him in Bengali, (published posthumously in 1919) Bhagabat Geetar Shamolochana, was a critical review of Bhagavad Gita. On 6 December 1918, Soham Swami passed away while in deep meditation or Samadhi in his hermitage at Bhawali. His samadhi(tomb) is located at Palitpur, Burdwan, India.There is also a symbolic samadhi at his Nainital ashram. It is due to the fact that after his mahasamadhi or death at his Nainital ashram, his last remains were brought to the Palitpur ashram of Tibbetibaba and a samadhi (tomb) was built at the Palitpur ashram.Brahmachari, Akhandananda, Paramhamsa Tibbati Babar Smriti Katha(Reminiscences of Tibbetibaba),(Bengali edition), India: Tibbati Baba Vedanta Ashram, 76/3, Taantipara Lane, P.O.

Parts of the building date from the Norman period and the chancel arch is 12th century. The church lies in a secluded position off Wessex Lane, near the north-eastern edge of Southampton and is almost hidden in the Southampton University accommodation campus. History South Stoneham parish The original parish of South Stoneham covered over and extended along the eastern side of the River Itchen from the site of the present day Eastleigh in the north to just above Northam Bridge in the south, and from Swaythling to the outskirts of the original town of Southampton on the western side of the river, and included the tithings of Allington, Barton, Pollack, Shamblehurst, and Portswood. Other than the church and a few adjacent houses, there was no village of \\"South Stoneham\\", which is now part of Swaythling, a suburb of Southampton. In the Domesday Book, the church at South Stoneham was the property of Richer the clerk, \\"who held this, with two dependent churches near Southampton, of the bishop of Winchester\\". Richer (\\"Richerius\\") was also the priest and holder of the benefice of St. Mary's Church at Southampton. The parish was listed as \\"Stanham ‚Äì Manebrige Hundred ‚Äì Hantscire\\". By the 16th century, South Stoneham was described as \\"an appropriation of St. Mary's Church, Southampton\\" and both churches were in the gift and under the special jurisdiction of the Bishop of Winchester. The living at South Stoneham then became the gift of the rector of St. Mary's, Southampton, who held the right of presentation until the early 20th century. As a result of the expansion of Southampton, the Local Government Act 1894 caused much of the parish of South Stoneham to be incorporated into newly formed neighbouring civil parishes, with the remaining parish covering approximately around the church and the village of Swaythling. Today, the parish is part of the parish of Swaythling, which also incorporates the \\"Flower Roads\\", Hampton Park and Mansbridge estates as well as part of Townhill Park, with the principal church being St. Alban's Church in Burgess Road, built in 1933. The vicar of the parish (i.e. both churches) is the Revd Peter Dockree. The church There is evidence that part of the present building dates from the Norman period; the earliest remaining part is the chancel, which with the chancel arch of chalk is 12th century, with a 15th- century Perpendicular east window (Victorian glass). The nave is 13th century and the tower late-15th century. The north transept was rebuilt in 1728 to house the early 18th century baroque monument to Edmund Dummer, attributed to Nicholas Hawksmoor, who is also believed to have designed South Stoneham House. The Dummers were Squires of Swaythling and lived at The Grange, a 16th-18th-century house now demolished. The nave monument to Sarah, wife of Hans Sloane, provides another link with South Stoneham House, where the Sloane family lived. The south transept was built as part of the reconstruction carried out in 1854 by G. Guillaume, which also included the present gallery, replacing one built in 1715. The church exterior St. Mary, South Stoneham The church is built of stone with a tiled roof, with a chancel, nave, two aisles, two small transepts and a west tower. The late-15th-century tower has small double uncusped belfry lights, later battlemented parapet and 19th century west doorway. Above the belfry window on the south face of the tower is a sundial, bearing the motto: \\"So Flies Life Away. 1738\\". The tower houses a peal of three bells which were cast in 1880 by Gillett & Bland, although some sources claim that two of the bells originate from 1603 and 1619. Over the west doorway, which is a modern imitation of twelfth-century work is a niche, probably designed for a statue of the Virgin and Child. The churchyard contains examples of 18th century headstones with cherub, skull, heavenly crown, trumpet urn and hourglass and flower motifs and 19th century oval body stones and chest tombs. The boundary wall to the churchyard on the north side, which adjoins South Stoneham House, is a Grade II listed building. On the register of listed buildings, the wall is described: > Early C18 red brick wall, about in height laid in English Bond. Near the > base is a half-diaper pattern formed of vitrified headers. Red brick plinth > and coping. This wall borders on South Stoneham House and was probably built > about the same time circa 1708. The interior The church consists of the chancel and nave with small north and larger south transepts. The chancel is by with south vestry, and the nave by . The chancel arch and walls, and part of the nave walls date from the 12th century. The east window of the chancel dates from the 15th century, with three cinquefoiled lights and tracery over. In the north wall are three single lights; the middle window is higher in the wall than the others, and round- headed and dates from the 12th century; the lancets on either side are 13th century additions. There was originally a similar arrangement on the south side, but the west window of the three has been blocked by the later addition of the vestry. The small pointed doorway opening to the vestry is probably a 13th-century priest's door. The chancel arch has two pointed orders with a roll on the western angles with detached jamb-shafts to the outer order, and keeled engaged shafts to the inner. The latter have hollow-fluted capitals and spurred bases, while the capitals of the outer order are carved with plain foliage. The nave has two windows on the north and one on the south, and is fitted with a west gallery. The north transept has modern two-light windows on east and west, and opens to the nave by a modern arch of 12th century style, but the jambs of the arch are of old stonework, perhaps of 14th century date. The south transept opens to the nave by a tall arch with an imitation of 12th century detail, and is of modern date. The gallery contains a small manual organ built in 1857 by J. W. Walker & Sons; and there is also a \\"dumb organist\\" made at the same time, apparently one of only two or three in existence; when placed across the keyboard, hymn tunes could be played by turning a handle.There is another at All Saints, Easton on the Hill, Northamptonshire and another at St Peter's, Bushey Heath, Hertfordshire. A third may exist at St Andrew's, Fersfield, Norfolk: Font The font at the north-east of the nave, is of Purbeck marble and dates from about 1180; it has a square bowl having four round-headed arches on each face enclosing wedge-shaped objects in relief. The upper surface of the bowl has foliage in the angles, and the bowl is carried on a central and four outer shafts, the latter being modern, while the base stone is old. Monuments Memorial to Edmund Dummer . Over the chancel arch are the royal arms of Charles II, dated 1660. On the south side of the chancel is the tomb of Edmund Clerke who was clerk to His Majesty's Privy Seal and died in 1632, and his wife Anne: their figures are kneeling under a canopy, with those of four sons and eight daughters on the base of the monument. Opposite this is a tomb dated from about 1540. The north wall of the north transept is entirely occupied by the large grey and white marble monument of Edmund Dummer (1663‚Äì1724). The church was the final resting place of several members of the Dummer family; in addition to Edmund, there are monuments to his brother, Thomas (1667‚Äì1749) and Thomas' son, Thomas Lee Dummer (1712‚Äì1765). Thomas Dummer (1739‚Äì1781), the son of Thomas Lee, and his widow Harriet (died 1835) also have a joint memorial in the church. The Dummer family crypt lay beneath the church, but was prone to flooding from the nearby River Itchen. In the 1960s the church members were concerned that whenever the river flooded \\"the Dummers could be heard jostling about beneath their feet\\". It was therefore decided to fill in the crypt. Other artefacts The church has some of the finest silver in Southampton, the earliest a cup of 1630; also a bible of 1572 and a shepherd's crook reputed to be more than 300 years old. The church is also home to the University of Southampton portable campanile ‚Äì this consists of 12 bells cast by Richard Bowditch and Matthew Higby in 1999. Restoration In October 2008, the parish announced plans for a restoration project for the church at a projected cost of ¬£150,000. Launching the project, the then Vicar of Swaythling, the Rev. Gary Philbrick, said: > It's one of the two oldest churches in the area, a little gem, one of > Southampton‚Äôs best kept secrets. It has been maintained by succeeding > generations and now it is our turn to do a major restoration of the building > so it can be preserved for the future. The work is needed to correct > mistakes made during a previous restoration effort 100 years ago, when > Victorian builders repointed the medieval stonework. The use of cement-based > mortar has caused the stonework to crack, causing damp, and must be replaced > with a lime-based equivalent. The restoration will begin with the west > tower, the roof, the boiler room and the damaged stonework. Once the ancient > building has dried out, which could take up to two years, redecoration will > begin, costing up to ¬£20,000. Amongst the work required is: #Replacing the cement-based mortar in the tower with lime-based mortar, both to stop damp getting in and to preserve the exterior stonework surface of the walls. #Replacing lead flashings on the roofs to prevent the ingress of moisture, particularly in the Transepts. Replacement tiles are needed, as are repairs to down-pipes and gutters. #To repair the stonework, especially around the Norman West Door and some of the windows, which has deteriorated badly. #To demolish the ugly mid-20th century boiler house and re-site the boiler in the Clergy Vestry. #Re-decoration of the interior of the Church. The restoration work was undertaken by Fareham- based HGP Architects with Michael Underwood, a Conservation Architect as the Inspecting Architect; Underwood was also a member of the Diocese of Winchester Diocesan Advisory Committee.

The South Stoneham Crematorium was located north of the cemetery but demolished during 1973 to make way for the construction of the M27 motorway. The South Stoneham garden of remembrance is now located at the north end of the cemetery. The cemetery includes the graves of 66 military casualties which are maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, comprising 3 Commonwealth and 2 Belgian war graves of World War I and 61 Commonwealth graves of World War II. The crematorium was opened in 1932 but by the 1960s was becoming inadequate for the growing number of cremations, and its equipment was approaching obsolescence. As a result, the council built a new crematorium in Bassett Green Road, which was opened in October 1973, with the South Stoneham Crematorium closing at the same time. The buildings were demolished during the construction of the new motorway with the garden of rest being re-located on an adjacent strip of allotment land. The complete layer of topsoil containing the cremated remains in the old garden of rest was removed and transferred to the new site by hand with the topsoil being placed in the new garden in the same relative position.

The clan is recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms but does not have a clan chief recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, therefore the clan has no standing under Scots Law.Way, George and Squire, Romily. (1994). Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). pp. 362. Clan Bissett is considered an armigerous clan, meaning that it is considered to have had at one time a chief who possessed the chiefly arms; however, no one at present is in possession of such arms. The surname Bissett is also considered a sept of the Clan Fraser of Lovat. History Origins of the clan The surname Bisset is believed to be of Norman origin and was brought to Scotland when William the Lion returned from captivity in England, accompanied by the Biseys. The Bysets settled in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire in England. They appear with other Norman families to have successfully established themselves and gained land in Morayshire, Scotland. The power of the family spread and persons bearing the surname witnessed several charters in the 13th and 14th centuries. A charter of Alexander III of Scotland to Paisley Abbey was witnessed by Thomas de Bissat. The rising fortunes of the family were eclipsed however by a feud with the Earl of Atholl. In 1242 at a tournament held at Haddington, Walter Byset, Lord of Aboyne was defeated by the youthful Earl of Atholl (possibly Padraig, Earl of Atholl). Allegedly, Byset, in a fit of anger murdered the earl while he slept and then set fire to his house to conceal the crime. Walter Byset and his nephew John then fled to Ireland and then to England. The feud followed the two fugitives as a pardon was later granted to the son of the Earl of Atholl for killing some Bysets in Ireland. Habakkuk Bisset was a lawyer and Writer to the Signet during the reign of James IV of Scotland. 20th and 21st centuries The principal line of the clan is now that of Bisset of Lessendrum, one of the oldest families in Aberdeenshire.

It was later held by the Clan Fraser of Lovat and then the Clan Mackenzie. * Beaufort Castle, Beauly was originally held by the Bissets but passed by marriage to the Frasers of Lovat in the thirteenth century. *Kilravock Castle, six miles west of Nairn was also originally a strong hold of the Clan Bisset but passed by marriage to the Clan Rose in the thirteenth century. *Lessendrum, three and a half miles north east of Huntly was the seat of the longest lasting branch of the clan, the Bissets of Lessendrum. *Upsettlington Castle, near Upsettington (now Ladykirk), Scottish Borders, was the seat of the Bissets of Upsettlington. ;Ireland *Glenarm Castle, Glenarm, Northern Ireland *Red Bay Castle, Glenariff, Northern Ireland *Rathlin Castle, County Antrim, Northern Ireland Peerages * Barony of The Aird * Barony of Lessendrum * Lord Lovat * Lord Aboyne * Lord Beauly * Lord Beaufort * Lord of the Glynns References Further reading *Temple, Rev.

She inherited the Dromana estate in 1664 upon the death of her father. She was married three times; firstly to John Le Poer, 2nd Earl of Tyrone; secondly to Brigadier-General, Hon. Edward FitzGerald-Villiers; and thirdly and lastly to General William Steuart. She was granted the rank of a Viscountess by Royal Warrant on 6 January 1700, and she died insane 25 years later.Charles Mosley, Burke's Peerage, Baronetage, and Knightage, 107th Edition, Volume 2, p. 2096  Family and inheritance  Katherine FitzGerald was born in August 1660 at Dromana House, Villierstown, County Waterford, Ireland, the only child and heiress of Sir John FitzGerald, Lord of Dromana and Decies, and Katherine Le Poer (died 22 August 1660), daughter of John Le Poer, 5th Baron Le Poer and Ruth Pypho. The lords of Dromana had managed to keep their lands intact through the Cromwellian settlements. This was due to their Protestant religion, and the marriage of Katherine's aunt, Lettice to Parliamentarian Major Richard Franklyn, who protected the family's interests. Katherine inherited the entire Dromana estate on 1 March 1664, at the age of three, upon the death of her father, who was the son of Sir Gerald FitzGerald, Lord of Dromana and Decies, and Mabel Digby. Katherine's mother had died shortly after her birth; and her stepmother Helen McCarthy had not produced offspring. Being only a minor, Katherine's guardians were King Charles II of England, and her maternal uncle, Richard Le Poer, 6th Baron Le Poer of Curraghmore (later the 1st Earl of Tyrone) (1630- 14 October 1690).  Marriages and issue  Her ambitious uncle Baron Le Poer, wanting to unite the Curraghmore and Dromana estates, arranged a marriage between Katherine and his own son and heir, John. On 20 May 1673, Katherine and John were married by Gilbert Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury in his chapel at Lambeth Palace.Public Record Office of Northern Ireland: Villiers- Stuart Papers MIC 464, T313, retrieved 16-11-09 She was three months short of her 13th birthday, and John was a boy of eight. That same year, her uncle was created 1st Earl of Tyrone and Viscount Decies by King Charles. Two years later, Katherine, who had not wanted to marry her eight-year-old cousin John Le Poer, appealed to the Archbishop to grant her an annulment on the grounds that she had not freely consented to the marriage. In March 1677, Katherine eloped and married an officer, Brigadier-General, Hon. Edward Villiers, the son of George Villiers, 4th Viscount Grandison and Mary Leigh, and a cousin of Barbara Villiers, the notorious and powerful mistress of King Charles. Following her clandestine marriage to Edward, there ensued a lengthy legal battle, which Katherine eventually won, due to the help from Edward's influential cousin, Barbara. Her marriage to Edward Villiers was thus declared legal and valid, while her uncle was forced to give back her lands and renounce the title of Viscount Decies.Julian Walton Dromana: Lords of Decies and Villiers-Stuart, p.10, retrieved 14-11-09 John Le Poer, her erstwhile husband later succeeded to the title of 2nd Earl of Tyrone in October 1690. An artist, who was a follower of court painter Sir Peter Lely, painted her portrait between 1685 and 1690. The portrait, which is in a private art collection, shows Katherine to have been slender, with auburn hair and fair skin. Together Katherine and Edward had four children: * Mary Villiers (died 24 December 1725), married Brigadier-General Hon. William Steuart (d.1736) M.P., her stepfather's eldest nephew and adopted son; brother of Admiral James Steuart M.P. * Harriet Villiers (died 21 October 1736), married Robert Pitt, by whom she had a son, William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham * John FitzGerald Villiers, 5th Viscount Grandison, and 1st Earl Grandison (1684- 14 May 1766), married Frances Cary, by whom he had issue. * William Villiers Edward died in 1693, and she married her third husband, General William Steuart, Commander- in-Chief of Queen Anne's forces in Ireland, and a Member of the Irish Parliament for County Waterford. This marriage was childless. Shortly after the death of her former father-in-law, Viscount Grandison, Katherine was granted the rank of Viscountess by Royal Warrant issued by King William III of England on 6 January 1700.  Death  She died insane almost 26 years later in London on 26 December 1725, aged 65. She was buried in Westminster Abbey. One month later General William Steuart married Eliza Alston, daughter of Sir Rowland Alston (1654‚Äì1697), 2nd Bart., of Odell Castle, Bedfordshire, by his wife Temperance, daughter and heiress of Thomas Crew, 2nd Baron Crew.

Dormant in winter, when the outer scales and many of the scale tips dry to a paper-like state, the plants burst to growth in late spring or summer, producing one or more very fast-growing stems that needs to be supported by a trellis or stake. The stems are covered with many leafless side-branches that may fall off. The small greenish-white flowers appear in spring.

He generally found the lectures rather mechanical but his curiosity in what was to become the object of a lifelong research interest was stirred where he did course work in his final year, when he read, together with Meyer Reinhold and Moses Finkelstein, the Zenon papyri under the direction of William Linn Westermann. Europe, 1933‚Äì1936 Lewis pursued further postgraduate studies in Europe with a fellowship from the American Field Service.Roger S. Bagnall, 'Naphtali Lewis (1911‚Äì2005),' The Bulletin of the American Society of Papyrologists, Vol. 43, 2006 pp. 5‚Äì8. After receiving a certificate at the University of Strasbourg (1933), he went to Paris where he pursued his studies on papyrology under Paul Collart, and more generally, trained as an historian under Gustave Glotz. His first work, a doctoral thesis in French, was L'industrie du papyrus dans l'√âgypte gr√©co-romaine (Paris,1934), a study of the papyrus plant and how it was manufactured and used for writing.J. David Thomas, 'Naphtali Lewis: 1911‚Äì2005,' in Aegyptus, Vol. 86 (2006), Vita e Pensiero ‚Äì Pubblicazioni dell'Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore pp. 217‚Äì221, p.217. He published an English version of his thesis much later in 1974 under the title Papyrus in Classical Antiquity. He spoke French fluently but with a Bronx accent. He then moved to Rome and furthered his research for 2 years at the American Academy in Rome, working on the Fouad papyri. He also managed to travel widely at this time, visiting the Mediterranean, travelling through the Levant and Palestine and sojourning in Istanbul and Athens. Return to the United States On returning to the United States, where the effects of the Depression made employment difficult, he did odd jobs and filled part-time posts until, in 1928, Casper Kraemer managed to get him a post at New York University on the recommendation that he conduct research on the Karanis papyri. There he made a lifelong friendship with Lionel Casson. When WW2 broke out he became a translator for the Engineer Corps, and later head of war research at Columbia University. Postwar Period From 1947 until 1976 Lewis taught at Brooklyn College (whence he retired as Distinguished Professor) and was also involved in the City University's Graduate School. He served as president of the American Society of Papyrologists (1965‚Äì1969) and as president of the Association Internationale de Papyrologues (1974‚Äì1983). His wife was summoned in 1953 to be interrogated during the McCarthyist witch-hunt to respond to interrogations about possible Communist connections, but refused to answer, pleading the Fifth Amendment. After his wife's death in 1987, Lewis suffered a heart attack, but on regaining his health married Ruth Markel, who was to predecease him, passing away in 2004. In retirement, he continued to conduct research and publish, and also taught papyrology and ancient history as a visiting professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.Alan K.

Here, H is 4. Gray entries are occupied. In part (a), the item x is added with a hash value of 6. A linear probe finds that entry 13 is empty. Because 13 is more than 4 entries away from 6, the algorithm looks for an earlier entry to swap with 13. The first place to look in is H‚àí1 = 3 entries before, at entry 10. That entry's hop information bit-map indicates that d, the item at entry 11, can be displaced to 13. After displacing d, Entry 11 is still too far from entry 6, so the algorithm examines entry 8. The hop information bit-map indicates that item c at entry 9 can be moved to entry 11. Finally, a is moved to entry 9. Part (b) shows the table state just before adding x. Hopscotch hashing is a scheme in computer programming for resolving hash collisions of values of hash functions in a table using open addressing. It is also well suited for implementing a concurrent hash table. Hopscotch hashing was introduced by Maurice Herlihy, Nir Shavit and Moran Tzafrir in 2008. The name is derived from the sequence of hops that characterize the table's insertion algorithm. The algorithm uses a single array of n buckets. For each bucket, its neighborhood is a small collection of H consecutive buckets (i.e. ones with indices close to the original hashed bucket). The desired property of the neighborhood is that the cost of finding an item in the buckets of the neighborhood is close to the cost of finding it in the bucket itself (for example, by having buckets in the neighborhood fall within the same cache line). The size of the neighborhood must be sufficient to accommodate a logarithmic number of items in the worst case (i.e. it must accommodate log(n) items), but only a constant number on average. If some bucket's neighborhood is filled, the table is resized. In hopscotch hashing, as in cuckoo hashing, and unlike in linear probing, a given item will always be inserted-into and found-in the neighborhood of its hashed bucket. In other words, it will always be found either in its original hashed array entry, or in one of the next H‚àí1 neighboring entries. H could, for example, be 32, a common machine word size. The neighborhood is thus a \\"virtual\\" bucket that has fixed size and overlaps with the following H‚àí1 buckets. To speed the search, each bucket (array entry) includes a \\"hop-information\\" word, an H-bit bitmap that indicates which of the next H‚àí1 entries contain items that hashed to the current entry's virtual bucket. In this way, an item can be found quickly by looking at the word to see which entries belong to the bucket, and then scanning through the constant number of entries (most modern processors support special bit manipulation operations that make the lookup in the \\"hop- information\\" bitmap very fast). Here is how to add item x which was hashed to bucket i: # If the hop-information word for bucket i shows there are already H items in this bucket, the table is full; expand the hash table and try again. # Starting at entry i, use a linear probe to find an empty entry at index j. (If no empty slot exists, the table is full.) # While (j‚àíi) mod n ‚â• H, move the empty slot toward i as follows: ## Search the H‚àí1 slots preceding j for an item y whose hash value k is within H‚àí1 of j, i.e. (j‚àík) mod n < H. (This can be done using the hop-information words.) ## If no such item y exists within the range, the table is full. ## Move y to j, creating a new empty slot closer to i. ## Set j to the empty slot vacated by y and repeat. # Store x in slot j and return. The idea is that hopscotch hashing \\"moves the empty slot towards the desired bucket\\". This distinguishes it from linear probing which leaves the empty slot where it was found, possibly far away from the original bucket, or from cuckoo hashing which, in order to create a free bucket, moves an item out of one of the desired buckets in the target arrays, and only then tries to find the displaced item a new place. To remove an item from the table, one simply removes it from the table entry. If the neighborhood buckets are cache aligned, then one could apply a reorganization operation in which items are moved into the now vacant location in order to improve alignment. One advantage of hopscotch hashing is that it provides good performance at very high table load factors, even ones exceeding 0.9. Part of this efficiency is due to using a linear probe only to find an empty slot during insertion, not for every lookup as in the original linear probing hash table algorithm. Another advantage is that one can use any hash function, in particular simple ones that are close to universal.

It is a story of Hana and Emil Vrbata, a couple living in German-occupied Czechoslovakia, in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, during World War II. The general reception by the Czech press and the audience was extremely positive.Users rating at csfd.cz \\".\\" It was selected as the Czech Republic's submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the 82nd Academy Awards. Plot It is 1938 and the Nazis are just one step away from invading and occupying Czechoslovakia. Hana is a young Czech film actress who also happens to be Jewish. She has just appeared in her first feature with her leading man, an older Jewish actor, who warns her that her career is over. He furthermore tells her that their picture will \\"never see the light of day\\" due to the fact that the Nazis will never allow its release. He hands her a forged passport and papers to get out of the country but she throws them in the trash, not believing what he says about the imminent German invasion. As the filming of the 'film within a film' is on the verge of completion, we see the two actors riding stationery bicycles with a moving image in the background. As was the usual practice in creating films in earlier days, the illusion of motion is created when the moving image flickers in the background but the object in the foreground is static. This cyclist becomes a symbol for the man who pedals furiously but is actually going nowhere. That man is the Czech \\"every-man\\" of 1938 who desperately wishes to escape his tragic circumstances but in reality remains motionless, trapped by the forces of tyranny. Throughout the film, we catch glimpses of the film's protagonist, Emil, pedaling furiously, superimposed over the screen's larger canvas. Hana is married to Emil, a journalist, who is conscripted by collaborating Czech officials at the radio station where he works to serve as a radio announcer after a colleague, Franta, who will not keep his opinions about the Germans to himself, is taken away by occupying forces and later executed. Emil cooperates to protect his wife from being deported to the death camps. Emil's boss at the radio station is a Nazi sympathizer who offers him the job with the understanding that no one will bother him about his wife. Soon, Emil has become popular hosting a cultural program in Prague entitled \\"Voices of Our Home\\". Meanwhile Hana becomes bored sitting at home and jeopardizes Emil's position by leaving their apartment, usually to attend the cinema. As Hana is rebellious and exasperated, she refuses to accept how risky her position is as a Jew in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. She is almost arrested leaving the cinema after curfew, rescued by former medical student, now morphine-addicted projectionist, Petr. As tensions arise, Emil begins having an affair with former colleague and former lover of Franta, Vera. Vera is now engaged to his boss, after dumping Franta for not being able to \\"listen.\\" After figuring out Emil is having an affair, Hana begins seeing Petr more and more, as they both begin to take up the dangerous hobby of Petr taking pictures Hana in front of Anti-Jewish shop signs. He wants to go to bed with her but she resists his advances, eventually allowing him, however, to take pictures of her in the nude. At this point in the film, things slow down considerably as Hana is no longer talking to Emil with the conflict between the two principals, grinding to a halt. Hana's former film co-star shows up at their apartment having just escaped from a death-transport (he never made it out of Czechoslovakia). Emil is horrified that Hana allows him to take a bath in the apartment and throws him out on the street. Enraged at Emil for throwing her ex-colleague out, Hana dons her blond wig and adopts the persona of her character from her movie and crashes Emil's boss's wedding. Emil is on the verge of being fired for his 'transgression' when Reich Protector Heydrich is assassinated by Czech partisans. Nazi soldiers do a house-to-house search and discover Hana is in the apartment. When they realize who Emil is, they take no action against Hana, despite the fact that the soldiers know she is Jewish. Later, the Nazis broadcast a description of a bicycle used by one of the partisans who has killed Heydrich. Emil has another affair with a gossip columnist and takes her family's bicycle back to his apartment and attempts to hide it; this leads Hana to believe that Emil has switched sides and is now helping the partisans. Now Emil's boss orders him to prove his loyalty by reading a loyalty oath over the airwaves after the Heydrich assassination places all Czech citizens in jeopardy. Meanwhile, Hana has come down to earth after she escapes arrest during the house-to-house search. However, when Emil's second lover comes to Hana for help after she saw Emil get taken away, Hana realizes where the bike is truly from and believes that Emil was never on her side after all. She packs her belongings to go find Petr, ultimately ripping off her wedding ring. Unfortunately, she finds Petr completely under the influence of morphine and watching her first feature film. The Nazis hear the loud music and arrest him, with Hana barely getting away. After she has realized that there is nothing left to live for, she turns herself into the authorities. Emil decides not to show up at the broadcast to read the loyalty oath to go looking for Hana, riding the bike that is believed to belong to the man who assassinated the Reich Protector. Emil finds her in a crowd of Jews being marched to the death-transports. He stands impassively with the bike blocking the group's path. Nazi soldiers club him in the head and drag him to the side of the road. He runs to meet Hana in the crowd and they gaze at each other. Emil is then attacked for a second time as Hana is marched away. Reception Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a critic score of 63% based on 8 reviews with an average rating of 5.5.

A copy is kept on permanent display in the Hungarian village of Vizsoly. History G√°sp√°r K√°roli, Calvinist pastor in the town of G√∂nc, began working on the translation in 1586 and finished it three years later. Since it would have been impossible for one person to translate the complete Bible in such a short time, others must have worked on it too; examination of the vocabulary and phrases used suggests that at least four people worked on it but the New Testament was translated by K√°roli in its entirety. Printing began on February 28, 1589 by B√°lint Mantskovit who moved his press from Galg√≥c to Vizsoly.Botty√°n J√°nos: Hit√ºnk h≈ësei, 58.old He imported type from the Netherlands and paper from Poland. Mantskovit was of Polish origin, and in a note he asks the reader to overlook the errors he possibly left in the text. When printing began, the full translation was not ready yet, so K√°roli's manuscripts were taken page by page to Mantskovit by students at G√∂nc, among them Albert Szenczi Moln√°r.History of G√∂nc On March 3, 1589 Archduke Ernest and the royal secretary Faustus Verantius accused Manstkovit of printing calendars and other forbidden books, and asked for the press to be confiscated.Magyar Protest√°ns Egyh√°zt√∂rt√©neti Adatt√°r XI. Bp. 1927 On March 26, Sigismund R√°k√≥czi, the future Prince of Transylvania, to whose estate Vizsoly belonged, denied the accusations and asked to be allowed to finish the printing of the Bible. Thanks to R√°k√≥czi and other powerful nobles supporting the cause, the printing was finished on July 20, 1590. Around 700‚Äì800 copies of the book were printed during this time. The book K√°roli names his sources in the foreword: the Vulgata, the Septuaginta, translations and commentaries by Franciscus Vatablus, Sebastian M√ºnster, Santes Pagninus and Immanuel Tremellius; he also used the Hebrew and Greek texts. It is not clear to what extent he utilized earlier, incomplete Hungarian translations; he does refer to those of G√°sp√°r Heltai and P√©ter Melius Juh√°sz, and he used the translation of Psalm 74 by Istv√°n Sz√©kely. The book has 2,412 pages and weighs about 6 kg. It consists of three volumes. The first volume, with the coat of arms of Hungary on its cover, includes the first 28 books of the Old Testament, with a table of contents and a lengthy foreword by K√°roli addressed to ‚Äúthe lords and heroic nobles, God-fearing communities, preachers in Hungary and in Transylvania‚Äù and is dated January 1, 1589. The second volume includes the remaining books of the Old Testament, while the third volume is the ‚ÄúNew Testament of our Lord Jesus Christ‚Äù, including a large folded-in page with Jesus's genealogy. K√°roli also included short summaries and commentaries before each chapter, explaining some of the verses with parallels to situations that were well known in the period.

After traveling to Italy Tlil committed petty crimes to support a drug habit. During a period when he was trying to quit his addiction to drugs Tlil traveled to Afghanistan, and received some military training at an Afghan training camp. Upon his return to Italy Tlil returned to crime, and was caught, convicted and sentenced, for petty drug dealing. After al Qaeda's attacks on the Continental United States, on September 11, 2001, his attendance at the Afghan training camp became of acute interest to American security officials. When Italian prison officials allowed American security officials to interrogate him Tlil was able to identify several other Tunisians who were being held in Guantanamo. Tlil initially agreed to testify against individuals in Guantanamo, either in Italy, or in the United States. Tlil was released in return for his agreement to testify, and was placed in the Italian version of a witness protection program. When Adel Ben Mabrouk and Mohamed Ben Riadh Nasri, two Tunisians who also had a record of committing petty crimes in Italy, who had been captured in Afghanistan, and had spent seven years in extrajudicial detention in Guantanamo, were transferred to Italy, Italian prosecutor Elio Ramondini said it would be \\"impossible\\" to convict them without Tlil's testimony. According to reports from the Associated Press, from November and December 2009, while Lazhar had been willing to serve as a witness against the men, he had recently indicated that he might no longer cooperate, because he is unhappy with how Italy's witness protection program is administered. The Associated Press reported he was also being considered as a possible witness against some of the senior al Qaeda captives who were then expected to face trial in the USA. In 2012 Tlil was profiled in the news again, as a vocal critic of Italy's witness protection program.

The film was produced by Aamir Khan Productions, Reliance Entertainment, and Shree Ashtavinayak Cine Vision Ltd, and stars Prateik Babbar, Monica Dogra, Kriti Malhotra and Aamir Khan in the lead roles. Gustavo Santaolalla was signed to compose the score and soundtrack of the film, which includes a song by Ryuichi Sakamoto. Dhobi Ghat had its world premiere in September 2010 at the Toronto International Film Festival and was released on 21 January 2011 in cinemas. The film being mainly tagged an Art and Parallel cinema was critically successful, as it well received and appreciated by critics, although it was an average performer at the box office. The film was longlisted for the 65th BAFTA Awards in the Best Film Not in the English Language category. Plot Arun (Aamir Khan), a reclusive artist, moves into a run-down flat in the older part of Mumbai. After attending an exhibition of his works, he meets Shai (Monica Dogra), an American banker who has come to Mumbai to devote time to her hobby, photography, and takes her back to his flat, where they have a one-night stand. The next morning, Arun expresses his disinterest in continuing the relationship and Shai angrily storms out. Shortly after, Munna (Prateik Babbar), a dhobi (washerman) who dreams about getting a break in Bollywood, arrives to deliver Arun's laundry. Arun moves into a new apartment the next day. While unpacking, he finds a small container that had been left by the previous tenant of the apartment. In it, he finds a silver chain, a ring, and three video tapes (Pehli chitti, Doosri chitti and Aakhri chitti) by Yasmin Noor. The tapes turn out to be video diaries through which Yasmin communicates with her brother. In the tape, she is generally happy, and shows her apartment, which is the same one Arun is occupying now. The next morning, Arun is informed by his manager that art dealers, impressed with his art, have decided to open a gallery in Sydney featuring his works. Arun is pleased by this, as it would also give him a chance to visit his ex- wife and child, settled in Australia. He begins to work on a new painting. When Munna delivers laundry to Shai's house, they meet and soon become friends. Munna agrees to show Shai around Mumbai and help her gather photographs about the occupations of the poor. In return, Shai agrees to shoot a portfolio of Munna to help him get into the film industry. Arun continues watching Yasmin's tapes and learns more about her life, including that she has recently married a man who seems distant. Shai obtains Arun's new address from Munna. Shai's father's construction company is constructing a building opposite Arun's apartment. Shai starts shooting photos of Arun from the construction site without Arun being aware of it. Munna continues struggling to find work in films. To earn a living, he washes clothes by day and kills rats by night. He disapproves of his brother's criminal activity but they are close, and Munna's brother uses his underworld contacts to try to get Munna a break in the industry. In the meantime, Munna shows Shai the different facets of Mumbai, including the dhobi ghaat, where he works as a launderer. Munna develops feelings for Shai but is unable to express them, mostly because of his working-class status. One day, Arun spots Shai nearby and invites her to his house. He apologises about their first meeting. Munna sees them together and feels betrayed but Shai is able to convince him to keep helping her. One night, while Munna is at his rat-killing job, Shai sees him and takes pictures. Dismayed, Munna flees from her. Arun watches the final video by Yasmin. Her tone has changed considerably since the previous tape, in which she revealed learning that her husband was in an extramarital affair. She strongly indicates that she intends to commit suicide. Shaken by the knowledge that Yasmin might have hanged herself in that very room, Arun flees the apartment and moves into a new one. Munna arrives home to find that his brother has been killed. He and his family relocate to a new flat and Munna visits his brother's contact in the film industry to show him his portfolio. Arun studies the painting he has been working on, which is now complete. Yasmin is prominently featured along with other things she had left behind. Shortly after, Shai finds Munna and Munna again tries to flee her, but she catches up with him. She insists upon their friendship and asks about Arun's whereabouts. Still hurt, Munna lies to her and they exchange an abrupt farewell before Shai leaves. Moments later, Munna changes his mind and runs after Shai's car, weaving through the traffic. The film ends when Munna catches up to the car and gives Shai Arun's new address.

Two other songs included in the movie are \\"Ab Ke Sawaan Ghar Aazaa\\" which is a thumri in Raga Tilak Kamod sung by Begum Akhtar and \\"Dil Tadap Tadap Ke Kah Raha Hai Aa Bhi Ja\\" which is from the film Madhumati and sung by Mukesh and Lata Mangeshkar. Production In an interview, Rao expressed that the film was meant to be a tribute to Mumbai and that she sought to reveal other sides of the city not often portrayed. The film was shot in Mumbai using \\"guerilla\\" techniques. Due to the 2008 Mumbai attacks, shooting was delayed when, citing safety concerns, the government denied Rao permission to shoot scenes at a railway station. According to the director, Mumbai is the \\"fifth character\\" in Dhobi Ghat. The movie was shot at skycrapers under construction, Mohammed Ali markets, sea facing bungalows at Worli, Dhobi Ghat at Mahalaxmi, Chowpatty and Marine Drive. No special sets were constructed to shoot the movie. The movie was released in 2 versions. The original version is around 40% English, while the second version has all dialogue dubbed in Hindi. Rapid Eye Movies, a German distributor bought the rights for the film's theatrical release in Germany. Dhobi Ghat was released without an intermission, becoming the first Indian film to do so. Critical reception Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Bhawana Somaaya, senior editor of Ticket Please gave the film a five out of five stars, stating that \\"Rao portrays the drudgery and the magnificence of the city in unforgettable imageries\\". She also says that \\"There is no doubting that Dhobi Ghat is amongst the most significant films in the history of Indian cinema\\" Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 70%, with an average score of 6.8/10. Blessy Chettiar, film critic of Daily News and Analysis wrote, \\"With Dhobi Ghat, Kiran Rao finally gives Mumbai a film that represents its true hues and tints.\\" Mathures Paul of The Statesman gave the film four stars out of five noting that, \\"Dhobi Ghat is part atmospheric portrait, part video diary that has enough heart- breaking moments you don't want to watch. But neither can you look away\\". Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph compared Dhobi Ghat with Satyajit Ray's Charulata in the way that the five characters, including Mumbai, operate like a string quintet. Mayank Shekhar of the Hindustan Times gave the film three and a half stars stating, \\"Bombay, is the centre of this film's attention. It's probably the only city in the world where so many classes so closely merge into a common river of sorrows, beauty or hope: unaware of how each affects the other every day. This film is first-rate tribute; it's visceral, I realize -- both clich√©s for compliments. Nothing more appropriate comes to mind.\\" Anupama Chopra of NDTV gave the film three stars, stating, \\"If you are willing to have patience, Dhobi Ghat comes together nicely. It has a poetry and melancholy that stays with you.\\" \\"Dhobi Ghat is a Poetry on Canvas!\\" said Swati Deogire of The ILIKE Times giving it a 3.5/5\\" Gaurav Malani of India Times Movies gave the film two stars, stating \\"Dhobi Ghat is a pretentious attempt at producing an arthouse piece\\". Box office In spite of being an art film with dark theme, Dhobi Ghat grossed after its theatrical run in India. Besides, Dhobi Ghat did well in the overseas markets including USA, UK and Dubai collecting after the second weekend. The movie completed its overseas theatrical run with a collection of about $12.6 million. Aamir Khan commented on Dhobi Ghat's success saying, \\"I am very happy with Dhobi Ghat's collection. Films like 'Dhobi Ghat' are really breaking grounds. It's a very unusual film and the kind of business it has done is huge for this kind of film. The kind of budget the film was made at, it's a very successful film. It made double the money it had cost us to make the film.\\". Boxofficeindia.com declared the film as \\"Average\\".

La Guaira was a port of the Royal Gipuzkoan Company of Caracas, whose ships had rendered great assistance to the Spanish navy during War of Jenkins' Ear in carrying troops, arms, stores and ammunition from Spain to her colonies, and its destruction would be a severe blow both to the Company and the Spanish Government. A British expeditionary fleet under Sir Charles Knowles was defeated, and the expedition ended in failure. 600 men were killed, among whom was the captain of , and many of the ships were badly damaged or lost. Knowles was therefore unable to proceed to Puerto Cabello until he had refitted.The Navy In the War of 1739‚Äì48, Cambridge University Press, p. 251 Background The British Admiralty had decided to prosecute the Ear Jenkins war against the Spanish settlements, though on a different scale from that of the great expeditions of 1741 and 1742.The Navy In the War of 1739‚Äì48, Cambridge University Press, p. 244 Sir Chaloner Ogle, who had replaced Admiral Edward Vernon after the defeat at the Battle of Cartagena de Indias in 1741, prepared an invasion of another important commercial port on the Spanish Main. Believing La Guaira to be not well defended, Sir Chaloner Ogle wanted to take advantage and attack. On 22 February 1743, Sir Charles Knowles sailed from the island of Antigua with 19 ships:David Marley, Wars of the Americas; A Chronology of Armed Conflict in the New World, 1492 to the Present, California, 1998, p.263 * 70-gun third rate * 70-gun third rate * 50-gun fourth rate * 50-gun fourth rate * 50-gun fourth rate * 40-gun fifth rate * 24-gun sixth rate * 20-gun sixth rate * 14-gun sloop * 8-gun bomb vessel (flagship) * Two transport ships with 400 militia under Colonel Dalzell * Seven other ships Knowles underestimated the defences of La Guaira, believing it to be less well defended than Cartagena de Indias had been. He arrived at La Tortuga island on 27 February. It is said that the Spaniards had two months warning of the attack recruited extra defenders and obtained gunpowder from the Dutchs. Whether this be true or not cannot definitely be stated.The Navy In the War of 1739‚Äì48, Cambridge University Press, p. 250 Battle Knowles in armour, one hand gestures to fortifications and a burning ship. At first light of the day, Knowles' squadron was east of the port of La Guaira and Otter was sent ahead to reconnoitre the inner harbour. Spanish lookouts lit signal fires at 6:30 A.M., alerting the people at both La Guaira and Caracas and bringing Governor Gabriel de Zuloaga down to the coast with a large body of militia that had been recruited from Colonel Dalzell's regiment in the West Indies. The commander of the Spanish garrison Mateo Gual and Captain Jos√© Iturriaga prepared for an impending assault supplied with gunpowder by the Dutchs. About midday HMS Burford stood into the roadstead, followed by HMS Eltham, Norwich, Suffolk, Advice and Assistance. Despite the hail of rounds from six batteries the English man-of-war anchored in a double line by 1:00 P.M. and began a furious exchange. The Spanish counterfire proved unexpectedly heavy and accurate and this combined with a heavy swell prevented any British disembarkation. The Spanish had been forewarned of Knowles's intentions to capture La Guaira. After three and a half hours, Burford cut the anchor cable and moved out of range; the frigate Eltham had also been damaged. Both accidentally ran afoul of Norwich, and all three ships left the action, reducing Knowles's overall effort. Shooting ceased at sundown, around 8:00 P.M, with the battered HMS Burford seeking shelter to leeward, escorted by HMS Norwich, Otter, and Assistance which could not anchor. The English resumed a rather desultorily bombardment at dawn the following day with the bomb vessel Comet. De Zuloaga was obliged to return to Caracas his capital on 4 March to reassure an uneasy populace that the enemy had not come ashore. At 3:00 A.M on 5 March Knowles sent boat parties into La Guaira's roadstead, they boarded a French merchantman before being discovered and driven off. Aftermath Having suffered 97 killed and 308 wounded over three days, Knowles decided to retire to west before sunrise on 6 March and attack nearby Puerto Cabello. Despite instructing his captains to rendezvous at Borburata Keys‚Äî east of Puerto Cabello‚Äîthe detached Burford, Norwich, Assistance, and Otter proceeded to Cura√ßao, compelling the commodore to angrily follow them in. On 28 March he sent his smaller ships to cruise off Puerto Cabello, and once his main body had been refitted, went to sea again on 31 March, only to then struggle against contrary winds and currents for two weeks before finally diverting to the eastern tip of Santo Domingo by 19 April.

In 1997, he joined Verona, where he spent the first two years as a member of the under-19 youth team. In January 1999 he was loaned out to Serie C1 side Lumezzane; the loan move was then later repeated for two more years, in January 2000 and November 2000. In January 2002 he was loaned out for a fourth time, this time to Sassari Torres, and he finally made his debut in a Verona jersey during the 2002‚Äì03 season in the Serie B league. Cagliari In 2005, he left Verona to join Cagliari, where he had the chance to make his Serie A debut, where he made 22 appearances, mostly as a substitute, and no goals.

He made his third debut for the club, and 247th game overall for Cagliari, in a 2‚Äì1 away defeat to Milan. On 8 August 2018 he played his farewell game in a friendly against Atl√©tico Madrid, was ceremoniously substituted at the 7th minute of the game and officially retired as a player. International career On 28 February 2010 he received his first call-up for the Italian national team for a friendly game versus Cameroon, making him the first Sardinian call-up after local legend Gianfranco Zola. Cossu played the game, held on 3 March 2010, as a starter: the match ended in a 0‚Äì0 draw. He was in Lippi's 28-men provisional 2010 FIFA World Cup squad, but was not included in the 23-men final squad on 1 June. But after the injuries of Mauro Camoranesi and Andrea Pirlo, he was named as an additional 24th standby player and was featured in the starting lineup in the last friendly game before the World Cup kick-off, against Switzerland on 5 June. Style of play Cossu is predominantly known for his ability to consistently create chances and provide assists for teammates, due to his vision, crossing ability, and passing range. Although he was initially deployed as a winger early in his career, he was later deployed as a forward, usually as a second striker, and as an attacking midfield playmaker, where he particularly excelled, finishing as the top assist provider in Serie A during the 2010‚Äì11 season. Despite lacking notable physical and athletic attributes, and having a tendency to be inaccurate in front of goal, he is a quick, mobile, technically gifted and creative player, with good dribbling skills; he is also an accurate set-piece taker.

Background Fisher Tench was the son of Nathaniel Tench (died 1710) and his wife Ann (died 1696), daughter and heir of William Fisher, Esq. Alderman of London.'Leyton: Manors and estates', A History of the County of Essex: Volume 6 (1973), pp. 184-197, accessed: 15 November 2009.'Leyton', The Environs of London: volume 4: Counties of Herts, Essex & Kent (1796), pp. 158-182, accessed: 15 November 2009. Nathaniel Tench bought the Great House estate at Leyton about 1686. The original house was probably Essex Hall, formerly Walnut Tree House, the oldest surviving building in Leyton in 1968. Nathaniel was one of the first directors of the Bank of England, and its Governor from 1699 to 1701. Nathaniel had previously been an Eastland and East India merchant. Fisher was educated at the Inner Temple and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge.Evelyn Cruikshanks and others, History of Parliament: House of Commons 1690-1715: V Members O-Z (Cambridge University Press for History of Parliament Trust, 2002), 619-621. The Great House at Leyton Nathaniel passed property at Leyton (comprising a capital message and 29 acres) to Fisher Tench and his wife Elizabeth in 1697. He inherited the rest of his father's estate in 1710, and probably soon after began to build the Great House at Leyton. It was a large mansion of two storeys, basement, and attics, built in the 'Wren' style of the period. The walls were of dark red brick with dressings of lighter brickwork and stone. The entrance front faced the high road and consisted of a central block flanked by lower and slightly recessed side wings. The main block had full-height Corinthian pilasters and a central pediment, while the wings had rusticated stone quoins. The whole fa√ßade, of thirteen bays, was surmounted by a modillion cornice, a panelled parapet, and hipped roofs with dormer-windows; six large stone vases broke the line of the parapet. The garden front was of similar size and character. The cupola from the house (demolished in 1905) is now on the tower of St. Mary's church. Parliament Fisher Tench first sought to enter Parliament at Shaftesbury in 1708, when he was referred to as an East India merchant. He served a year as High Sheriff of Essex in 1711 and then became a Whig Member of Parliament for Southwark in 1713, when he and his fellow Whig candidate wore wool in their hats to signify their support of cloth manufacturers, in opposition to the concessions made by the Tory government in the commercial clauses of the Treaty of Utrecht (which were never ratified).David Hayton, Eveline Cruickshanks, Stuart Handley, History of Parliament: The House of Commons, 1690-1715 I (Cambridge, 2002), 118. The election was declared void in 1714, but both he and his fellow member were re-elected. He remained an MP until 1722, and was created a Baronet in 1715. His initial election was declared void in 1714, but he and his fellow member John Lade were both re-elected at the subsequent by-election, a keenly fought (and probably expensive) contest, but he was re-elected unopposed in 1715. He withdrew from politics after he defeat at the election of 1722. He served as High Sheriff of Essex in 1711. Commercial activities Company director Fisher Tench became an Assistant of the Royal Africa Company in 1711 and its sub-Governor in 1716. This may have assisted his election to Parliament, as John Lade shared his interest. he also enjoyed the interest of Lord Cowper, one of whose prot√©g√©s he had assisted in that trade. He was a director of the South Sea Company from 1715 to 1718.R. Sedgwick, History of Parliament: House of Commons 1715-54: II Members E-Y (HMSO, London 1970), 465. Later in life, he was at times a director of the Company of Mineral and Battery Works, but sometimes in conflict with Sir John Meres, its governor.Information from Lowther correspondence in Cumbria Record Office, Carlisle. Lighting London In 1716, with Sir Samuel Garrard, he leased the convex lights of the City of London, under the London Lighting Act 1716.Catalogue of the Library of the London Institution IV (1852), 234. When he had difficulty in paying his rent in 1735, he unsuccessfully alleged that his 21-year lease was beyond the powers of the Corporation of London to grant.Thomas Leach, Modern reports, or, Select cases adjudged in the Courts of King's Bench [and other courts] (5th edition), Michaelmas 7 George II, 173. Plantations He owned a plantation in Virginia, run by slaves, whom he converted to Christianity. One of them (George Pompey) was commemorated in a memorial as a good Christian in his death after 20 years service to Sir Fisher Tench in 1735.Anthony S. Parent, Foul means: the formation of a slave society in Virginia, 1660-1740 (University of North Carolina Press for Omohundro Institute of Early American History & Culture, 2003), 253. Charitable Corporation He was elected to the Committee (Board of Directors) of the Charitable Corporation in October 1725, but held office for a little over a year, and was thus not involved in the frauds on that company.Report of Committee of House of Commons on the Charitable Corporation (1733), 35. However, he was present at a committee meeting when the cashier (William Tench ‚Äì his second son) was directed to draw its cash out of the hands of Mr Pepys and pay it to George Robinson. He was also at earlier committee meetings, which had resolved to issue notes to circulate like bank notes.Cobbett's Parliamentary History of England, Commons 5 George II, 1099. Viscount Percy, wondered whether he would be censured, having allowed his son to remain cashier during the frauds, particularly as the son's post was worth ¬£600 per year to him despite the salary being only ¬£150. Robinson was paying ¬£100, evidently to hide his roguery.Diary of Viscount Percival (afterwards 1st Earl of Egmont) I (Historical Manuscripts Commission, 1920), 270. Posterity Fisher Tench died in 1736, having had five sons and four daughters, but several (including his second son William) predeceased him. He was succeeded by his son Nathaniel, who died the following year. The Great House property then passed to Nathaniel's sister Jane. She married Adam Soresby (a widower). On her death in 1752, it passed to her stepson, William Soresby, who sold the property in 1758.

This is guided under Section 17(5) of RBI Act, 1934, and are '..repayable in each case not later than three months from the date of making that advance'. There are two types of WMA ‚Äì normal and special. While Normal WMA are clean advances, Special WMA are secured advances provided against the pledge of government of India‚Äìdated securities. The operative limit for special WMA for a state is subject to its holdings of central government dated securities up to a maximum of limit sanctioned. In addition, the RBI has determined limits for normal and special WMA for each state as multiples of the prescribed minimum balance required to be maintained with the RBI by that state. These limits have been revised periodically. These are temporary advances (overdrafts) extended by RBI to the govt. Section 17(5) of RBI Act allows RBI to make WMA both to the Central and State Govt. Objective ‚Äì to bridge the interval between expenditure and receipts. They are not a sources of finance but are meant to provide support, for purely temporary difficulties that arise on account of mismatch/shortfall in revenue or other receipts for meeting the govt. liabilities. They have to be periodically adjusted to enable use of such financing for future mismatches. On 26 March 1997, Govt. of India and RBI signed an agreement putting the ad hoc T-bills system to end w.e.f 1 April 1997.  Interest rate  The interest rate on WMA is at or around bank rate (with small adjustment for different kinds of WMA for State Govt.) and overdrawing if any carries 2% higher interest. Duration 10 consecutive working days for Central Govt. and 14 days for State Govt. Amount ceiling Limits on WMA are fixed at the beginning of a fiscal year by RBI. For 2018-19, Central Govt. limit is Rs.35000 cr for Oct-Feb and Rs.25000 cr for Mar.  Minimum balances  The minimum balance required to be maintained by Govt. on Fridays and at the close of the Govt.‚Äôs or RBI's financial year shouldn't be less than Rs.100 cr and on any other working day not less than Rs.10 cr. Further when 75% of WMA is utilised, the RBI may consider fresh flotation of market loans depending on the market conditions.

History Knocklong was originally known as Druim Damhghaire, the Ridge of the Oxen, but takes its present title from Cnoc Luinge, the Hill of the Encampment. According to tradition, King Cormac mac Airt set up his camp on this hill when he invaded Munster during the third century. The King of Munster consulted a Druid, Mug Ruith, who used his magical powers to help the Munster men to defeat Cormac's forces in a legendary battle said to have taken place about 250 A.D. Four centuries later, about 650, a more significant fight took place here when Dioma, King of Thomond, stopped the Connaught men from recovering County Clare from North Munster. This historic battle secured Clare for the Dalcassians so Cnoc Luinge may derive its present name from an encampment of the seventh century rather than the third century. Cnoc Luinge has also been translated as the Hill of the Ships, as the tents on the hill resembled ships under sail.Carroll Another version says that there was once a lake from Emly village in County Tipperary to the hill of Knocklong, on which small boats or ships used to sail.The siege of Droim D√°mhgh√°ire Although it is a small village, Knocklong played a role in modern Irish history. It is most famous for the rescue of Se√°n Hogan which took place at the railway station in Knocklong during the War of Independence on 13 May 1919. Hogan's colleagues from the Third Tipperary Brigade -- Se√°n Treacy, Dan Breen and S√©umas Robinson‚Äîwere joined by Ned Foley, JJ O'Brien, Ned O'Brien, Se√°n Lynch, and Jim Scanlon from the East Limerick Brigade, to organise Hogan's rescue. Hogan was being transported by train to Cork, and the men, led by Treacy, boarded the train in Knocklong. A close-range shoot-out followed on the train. Treacy and Breen were seriously wounded in the gun fight, two policemen (Sergeant Peter Wallace and Constable Enright) died, but Hogan was rescued. He was spirited away to Knocklong village, where his handcuffs were cleaved by S√©an Lynch, one of the rescuers, in the local butcher's shop. That train station no longer exists.Creaner The rescue at Knocklong is commemorated in the song \\"The Station of Knocklong\\", which was a popular ballad during the Irish War of Independence. Ned Foley was later arrested and executed for his part in the rescue along with Patrick Maher, a volunteer from Limerick, who had no involvement in the rescue at Knocklong. Gaelic Athletic Association Knocklong is steeped in tradition and the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) plays a major role in the community. The village has seen many of its residents over the years succeed in winning titles with both their club Garryspillane, \\"The Bouncers\\", and with their colleges and county team Limerick. In 2005, the club won their first ever Senior Hurling Title and later went on to win the All-Ireland Kilmacud Crokes mini-7s tournament..

It started as a half page strip but proved popular and was given a full page several weeks later. It was created and drawn by Mike Lacey.http://whackycomics.blogspot.be/2013_03_01_archive.html Concept The strip is about a fictional schoolboy called Whacky who is regularly being whacked (slang for \\"beating\\" or \\"thrashing\\") - later issues used the tag-line \\"He's always getting whacked\\" to emphasise the point. Most of the strips were school based and involved Whacky getting into trouble with his sadistic teacher Mr Thwackery - while these situations would typically involve lateness, talking in class etc., many times his teacher would find any excuse for regularly punishing him (even if Whacky is not at fault), which he often noticeably revelled in. His punishments were mostly the traditional \\"six of the best\\" with the cane - though in its absence other items would be used including an umbrella, slipper, plank, tree branch, walking stick, plimsoll, stick of rock, belt and book! At the time, the cane was still used in many British schools and coincided with the revival of the Jimmy Edwards TV show Whacko so this sort of behaviour was deemed perfectly innocent, as were the regular slipperings that Dennis The Menace received. In one strip Whacky reasons how he got his name: that when he was first born the nurse smacked him on his rear! The character was typically dressed as an old fashioned schoolboy: blazer (when in colour it would either be green, orange or red), matching cap, shirt and tie and school shorts, even in the winter. When not at school he usually wore a sweater; however, he still sported his school uniform shorts. He also carried the obligatory satchel to school. The strip ended in the comic in 1973 with Mr. Thwackery's retirement. A jubilant Whacky races out of school, convinced he will not be punished any more, but on the way home he kicks a football into his new neighbour's garden - who happens to be Mr. Thwackery. He duly chases the lad over fences, cane in hand, with Whacky exclaiming \\"Will it never end...?\\" Continuation The strip continued in the Cor!! summer specials and annuals that were still published into the early 1980s finishing with an appearance in the 1984 annual (published Christmas 1983) where Whacky walks into school to be greeted by a sign on the noticeboard exclaiming \\"No Whackings allowed\\" - mirroring real life as corporal punishment was being banned in England. Mr. Thwackery manages to punish Whacky \\"by accident\\" (opening a door onto him and dropping a desk lid on him as he is bent over) before he manages to whack the headmaster by mistake.

Corbett, Hugh Griffith, Eric Sykes and Ronnie Barker. The screenplay was written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson. Plot Hemel Pike (Harry H. Corbett) and his cousin Ronnie (Ronnie Barker) are two boatmen operating a canal-boat and its butty for British Waterways on the Grand Union Canal. Though the canals are struggling due to declining traffic, Hemel refuses to give up his traditional lifestyle. He also enjoys his reputation as a Don Juan, with girlfriends all across the canal network, something which Ronnie is envious of. Hemel and Ronnie set out from Brentford to Boxmoor, repeatedly encountering an inept mariner (Eric Sykes). At Rickmansworth, Hemel visits one of his lovers, a barmaid called Nellie (Miriam Karlin), but he has to make a quick exit when she accidentally learns about his other girlfriends. Hemel and Ronnie reach Boxmoor where they deliver their cargo before travelling on empty towards Birmingham. En route, Hemel meets up with another girlfriend. Hemel's next call is Leg O'Mutton Lock to meet Christine (Julia Foster), the daughter of lock-keeper Joe Turnbull (Hugh Griffith). Hemel thinks highly of Christine, but knows that Joe loathes the thought of his daughter becoming associated with a canal worker. On arrival, Ronnie takes Joe to the local pub to get him out of the way while Hemel and Christine get together. Christine, who hates the idea of living on a boat, attempts to persuade Hemel to leave the canal and get a job on land, but Hemel refuses, alarmed by her talk of marriage and settling down. Then he narrowly escapes from being caught by Joe who returns home drunk. After Hemel and Ronnie have left for Birmingham, Joe discovers that Christine is pregnant. Dismayed and angry, and having learned from Christine that the father is one of the canal workers, Joe drains the canal pound, padlocks the lock gates, and attaches a home-made bomb, and announces that he will prevent any traffic from passing through until the father comes forward. After various attempts to get him to stop have failed, Hemel and Ronnie arrive and, seeing the commotion and Christine being harassed by the locals, Hemel admits that he is the father. Joe allows Hemel to move in to his house until he and Christine can be married, and Hemel tries to find a job on land, but he misses the lifestyle and independence he enjoyed on the canals. At their wedding reception, Christine tells Hemel that she has a wedding gift for him and takes him to the canal where he sees that his boats have been renamed Hemel and Christine. She tells him that Ronnie has learned that all working-boats are to be withdrawn from the canals in 18 months time, and that she will agree to live on the boats on the canal with him and their baby until they are withdrawn, so that his family, who have been on the canals since the beginning, will be there at the end as well.

The first part of the passante was opened in 1997 and it was completed in 2008.Storia del Passante - sottomilano.it Its main feature is to be open in its extremities, and to be directly interconnected with the railway system of Lombardy. It is only used by suburban trains operated by Trenord. The passante is connected with subway lines at Porta Garibaldi station (Line 2 and Line 5), Repubblica station (Line 3), Rogoredo (Line 3) and Porta Venezia (Line 1). When Line 4 will open, it will connect with the passante at Dateo. The railway runs on the same line of the historic Milanese northern railway, which was removed in 1931 when the Milanese railway system was redesigned along with the opening of the grand new Central Station. \\"Passante\\" is the Italian word for \\"passing\\" and is used to describe a railway built through a major city, connecting suburban lines. This is modelled on S-Bahn underground junctions built in West Germany in the 1970s. History The idea of a suburban railway network for the city of Milan can be traced back to the 1960s, when the increasing population of the city and the surrounding boroughs made clear the need for a faster and more efficient way to complete medium to longer distance journeys. Designs for an underground railway passing through the city centre were completed at the end of the 1970s, and construction began in 1982, with the work expected to be completed in less than 10 years. Actual work proceeded very slowly, taking 15 years just to open the first part of the track from Bovisa to Porta Venezia.Il Passante √® una realt√†. In: ‚Ä≥I Treni‚Ä≥ Nr. 190 (February 1998), p. 5.

Two years later the Certosa branch was opened and was completed in 2002 with the opening of the new Villapizzone station. In the same year the Passante was expanded on the south-east to Dateo. In 2004, in conjunction with the opening of Porta Vittoria station, the new suburban service was activated.Il Passante - msrmilano.com The cost at that time was already ‚Ç¨915 million after 22 years of construction work.

As an astronomer, he is best known for his work in determining the distance from the Sun to the Earth (the astronomical unit) from 1900‚Äì1909: for this achievement, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. His later professional career was in surveying and cartography, an extension of his astronomical interests. Astronomical career Early work Hinks was educated at Whitgift School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1892. Measurement of the solar parallax Although Hinks had originally intended to measure stellar parallax, and produced an ambitious plan to do so in conjunction with Henry Norris Russell,.Hinks & Russell (1905b). an even more fundamental opportunity arose with the discovery in 1898 of 433 Eros. It soon became apparent that Eros was a near-Earth asteroid, and would be passing very close to the Earth in late 1900 ‚Äì early 1901. The closest approach was about 30 million miles (48 million kilometres), or about 125 times the distance from the Earth to the Moon, a stone's-throw in astronomical terms. With Eros passing so close to the Earth, it would be possible to measure its parallax to high precision, and so calculate the solar parallax or, in other terms, the distance from the Sun to the Earth (now known as the astronomical unit, a name that was coined at about this time).. An international effort to obtain accurate observations of Eros was put in place under the co-ordination of Maurice Loewy, then director of the Paris Observatory. Hinks was an enthusiastic, even zealous member of the team from the start,Hinks (1900b). and was responsible for the observations from Cambridge Observatory. In total, no fewer than fifty-eight observatories were involved. Hinks spent three months observing Eros from dusk until dawn in 1900/01 ‚Äì or rather, trying to observe Eros: the weather in Cambridge was unusually wet that winter, and Hinks only had half a dozen cloud-free nights during the whole period.Hinks (1905d).Despite the reputation of the British weather, Cambridge, in the east of the country, has a relatively dry climate: the average rainfall (552 mm, 21.7‚Ä≥ annually) is the same as that in Netanya in Israel, for example‚Ä¶ Source: WorldClimate.com. Fortunately he was using a photographic telescope, and was able to obtain some 500 exposures, as results from more traditional visual methods (meridian line or micrometre measurements) would have been far less conclusive. Hinks published the Cambridge results in November 1901,Hinks (1901b). but this was far from the end of the task. The results from all the participating observatories had to be collated and analysed, a monumental feat which initially fell to Loewy in Paris. An additional problem was that it was not clear how the different measurement uncertainties should be treated, especially as different observatories used different methods to calculate the apparent position of Eros. Hinks also participated in this initial period, publishing a comparison of his Cambridge results with those from the Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton, California, and from the Goodsell Observatory near Minneapolis, Minnesota.Hinks (1902b). However Hinks became increasingly concerned about the systematic errors in several of the results,Hinks (1903b). and published his own provisional result for the solar parallax in 1904, based on photographic observations from nine observatories.Hinks (1904c). Hinks continued to work on the problem as secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society, a post he held from 1903 to 1913 ‚Äì he admitted himself that solar parallax work it took up most of his time at the Cambridge Observatory,Hinks (1909a). although he did publish other papers. When Loewy died suddenly in 1907 (aged 74), Hinks appears to have taken over the final reduction of the data. The final result was published in 1909: the solar parallax was 8.807 ¬± 0.0027 arcseconds, slightly larger than the 8.80 arcseconds that Newcomb had calculated and that had been internationally accepted since 1896. Measurement of the lunar mass A bonus result was that Hinks was also able to calculate the ratio between the mass of the Earth and the mass of the Moon as 81.53 ¬± 0.047.Hinks (1909c). Later work Hinks resigned from the Cambridge Observatory in 1914 when he was passed over for the directorship in favour of the younger Arthur Eddington (1882‚Äì1944), a brilliant mathematician and one of the earliest astrophysicists. Hinks complained > \\"the whole trend in policy in Cambridge & England generally [‚Ä¶] is to take > astronomical posts as sustenance for mathematicians. [‚Ä¶] They must have been > mad to imagine that a man who had the ambition to do what I had been able to > do would be content with an inferior position and no fun all his life.\\"Cited > in . After the First World War Hinks admitted to William Wallace Campbell that he felt out of place in the new astronomy dominated by General Relativity and its consequences: > \\"Now that Peace is in sight, I find my thoughts reverting to astronomy a > little, and I hope eventually to finish off some things I had to leave > incomplete in 1913. [‚Ä¶] The statistical stuff with its integral equations > was bad enough. But relativity is much further beyond the limits of my > comprehension, and I shall find when I start to make up my two years arrears > of reading that I am hopelessly outclassed.\\"Cited in . Geographical career In 1903, Hinks undertook a course in surveying at the School of Military Engineering in Chatham in Kent.. At the time, there was no National Service (conscription) in the United Kingdom, and it is possible that he did the course to gain a profession to support his young family (he had been married for four years, and his son Roger was born in 1903), after eight years in a poorly paid junior post in astronomy. The same year, he was promoted to senior assistant at the Cambridge Observatory and appointed secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society. Hinks gained his first full academic post in 1908, a lectureship in surveying and cartography at the Cambridge School of Geography (part of the University of Cambridge, as was the Observatory) funded by the Royal Geographical Society (RGS).. In 1911, he was elected a fellow of the Society, becoming assistant secretary in 1912/1913 and succeeding John Scott Keltie as secretary in 1915. As secretary of the RGS, he also acted as editor of the Geographical Journal: he held both posts until his death in 1945. During the First World War, Hinks prepared maps and did other geographical work for the General staff. Hicks also provided reports on the boundary treaties put in place after the war, and on the implementation of the Treaty of Versailles, particularly the Upper Silesia plebiscite.Hinks (1920). Hinks was involved in the organisation of the expeditions to observe the total solar eclipse in May 1919 from Pr√≠ncipe off the west coast of Africa and from Sobral in Brazil,Hinks (1917). during which his nemesis from Cambridge, Eddington, would provide one of the first proofs of Einstein's theory of general relativity. Hink's most controversial role was as joint secretary of the Mount Everest Committee, a joint body of the RGS and the Alpine Club dedicated to organising an ascent of the world's highest mountain. The initial 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition suggested a route to the top from the Tibetan side, and a second expedition was sent out in 1922 to try to reach the summit. The 1922 expedition never made it to the summit, despite three attempts and, on the second attempt led by George Mallory, an avalanche killed seven sherpas. However George Finch and Capt. Geoffrey Bruce set a new altitude record, climbing to 8326 metres (27,316 feet) on the second summit attempt. Another expedition was organised for 1924. However Hinks vetoed Finch's inclusion on the expedition, despite his altitude record during the 1922 expedition, ostensibly because he was divorced and had accepted money for lectures. The true reason was that Finch was Australian, and Hinks was determined that the first person to reach the summit should be British. Mallory (who had also given paid lectures about the 1922 expedition) initially refused to return to Everest without Finch, but was eventually persuaded by members of the British royal family, at Hinks' request.. Mallory and Andrew Irvine died during the third attempt on the summit, ending all attempts to climb Mount Everest for several years.. Hinks published two textbooks on cartography and surveying, Map Projections (1912) and Maps and Survey (1913). After the war, he was involved in the development of radio time signalsHinks (1925). Hinks (1929). and in geodesy in general,Hinks (1927). two interests that are very much linked with astronomy.

James Burns succeeded to the title of Baron Inverclyde on the death of his elder brother, George Burns, in 1905. Biography James, Lord Inverclyde, was descended from a long line of prominent Glaswegians. One great-grandfather, Dr. Burns, was minister of the Barony Parish for sixty-nine years, from 1770, while another, Dr. Cleland, was a magistrate of the city, and in 1807 laid the foundation stone of St. George's Church. His grand-uncle, James, and his grandfather, Sir George Burns, Bart., were founders not only of the service of Irish steamers and of the West Highland service, but of the Cunard Line. His father, Sir John Burns, Bart., had the public services of his house recognised with a peerage in 1897 and became the first Lord Inverclyde. James Burns was born at Glasgow in 1864, and educated at Repton. He was the principal Director of the shipping business of Messrs. G. & J. Burns, Limited, and took a strong interest in everything connected with shipping. He was President of the Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom in 1899. In 1900 he became Chairman of the Glasgow Shipowners' Association, and was an Honorary Member of the Advisory Committee on New Lighthouse Works to the Board of Trade. He was a Director of the Cunard Steamship Co., Ltd., and of the Clydesdale Bank Ltd. He was a member of the Glasgow Committee of Lloyd's Register, a representative of Glasgow on the London General Committee of Lloyds' Register, and a Director of the Clyde Steamship Owners' Association. He was an Associate of the Institute of Naval Architects and of the Scottish Institute of Engineers and Shipbuilders. He was also involved in the religious and philanthropic life of the city. He became Prime Warden Shipwright of The Worshipful Company of Shipwrights in 1919, dying in office. In the realm of sport he was an enthusiastic yachtsman. He was Commodore of the Royal Clyde Yacht Club, Vice-Commodore of the Royal Northern Yacht Club and the Royal Highland Yacht Club, and also a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron. He was President of the Scottish Hockey Association, and took a leading part in bringing the game into vogue in Scotland. He also distinguished himself as a cricketer and lawn tennis player, and, as President of the Lorne Curling Club, taking a rink to Carsbreck bonspiel every winter. He owned the estate of Wemyss Bay, and had as his residence there Castle Wemyss. In addition to the ground belonging to his own house of Hartfield at Cove, he leased the shooting on Rosneath moor above from the Duke of Argyll. Lord Inverclyde was Lord Lieutenant of Dunbartonshire, and a Justice of the Peace for the counties of Lanark, Renfrew, and the County of the City of Glasgow. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the Clyde Royal Garrison Artillery of the Territorial Force on 27 March 1909.Army ListBurke's Peerage and Baronetage. He married on 2 April 1891, Charlotte Mary Emily, youngest daughter of Mr. Nugent-Dunbar of Machermore Castle, Newton Stewart, and had two daughters, Emily and Muriel, and a son, John Alan Burns, who succeeded him.

After leaving Repton he went into business with messrs. G. and J. Burns, of Glasgow, and began to acquire that intimate knowledge of shipping affairs which, at a later stage in his career, made him known in the House of Lords as the Representative of Shipping. As a director of the Cunard Steamship Company, Limited, he has shown decided ability, and it is rumoured that reasonably fresh eggs will shortly be procurable on the Company's liners. If Lord Inverclyde could achieve such a reform he would deserve well of us, but we have travelled by the Cunarders for many years, and dare not vouch for the story. :Lord Inverclyde has at no time figured prominently in municipal matters, being doubtless deterred by the displays of hooliganism for which Glasgow municipal gatherings have, of lat years, been notorious. He holds a number of posts, however, in which he serves with quiet distinction, and, as Lord Lieutenant of Dumbarton, has done excellent service towards the preservation of Dumbarton Castle, which surmounts the bald and precipitous dome of rock in the Clyde. :He is of sturdy habit, fond of all outdoor sports, and would like to divide his year into two seasons, one for curling and one for tennis, did not yachts and guns, in their season, shake his constancy. He is a member of the King's Bodyguard for Scotland, has a covered tennis court and a grouse moor, and a delightful residence at Castle Wemyss on the Firth of Clyde. :He is a Unionist Tariff Reformer, because he can't help it, and is incurably modest.\\"  References  *History of the Cunard Steamship Company, 1886 *Who's Who in Glasgow 1909 Barons in the Peerage of the United Kingdom 1864 births 1919 deaths People from Glasgow People associated with Inverclyde Lord-Lieutenants of Dunbartonshire People educated at Repton School Scottish cricketers Scottish male sailors (sport) Scottish male curlers Scottish male field hockey players Scottish businesspeople Scottish bankers Scottish landowners Scottish male tennis players British male tennis players ","title":"James Burns, 3rd Baron Inverclyde"},{"id":"25098687","text":"Adam Gottlob von Krogh (May 16, 1768 ‚Äì January 17, 1839) was a Norwegian- Danish military officer, and the son of Major General Caspar Herman von Krogh (b.

Born to a wealthy family in Stockholm as Inga-Stina Arvidsson, she attended √ñlinska Girls' School before becoming a secretary in the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs' office in London, where she met Lawrence Robson, an accountant, and the two married in 1940. During World War II, she worked as a translator for the British Ministry of Information.Inga- Stina Robson profile by Duncan Sutherland, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography; accessed 20 March 2014. Robson settled at Kiddington Hall near Woodstock, Oxfordshire, and worked on her husband's unsuccessful candidature for the Liberal Party in Banbury at the 1950 general election. Their house was used as a conference centre and was popular for Liberal Party events. In the run-up to the 1955 general election, Lawrence was the Liberals' prospective candidate in Eye, but he was appointed to a government commission and withdrew, leaving Inga-Stina to fight the seat, although she was not successful. Later the same year, she became a magistrate. Robson stood again in Eye at the 1959 general election, then in Gloucester in 1964 and 1966. Although she never came close to election to Westminster, she was elected to Chipping Norton Rural District Council. In 1968, Robson became President of the Women's Liberal Federation, standing down in 1970 when she was elected President of the Liberal Party. As president, she opposed radicalism and, in particular, the policies advocated by the National League of Young Liberals. She was created Baroness Robson of Kiddington, of Kiddington in the County of Oxfordshire on 14 May 1974, becoming the Liberals' spokesperson on agriculture and the environment in the House of Lords. In 1982, she succeeded her husband as Chair of the National Liberal Club, and also as Chair of the Anglo-Swedish Society. She joined the Liberal Democrats, successors of the Liberal Party, and in 1988, she chaired a panel investigating fraud in the European Union. She stood down as a magistrate in 1989, by which time she was the longest- serving magistrate in the country. In 1993, she became the party spokesperson on health.
