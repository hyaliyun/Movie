History During the large-scale migration in the 1920s and 30s from central Travancore, the whole of Malabar was under the Latin diocese of Kozhikode. The administrators of the diocese paid special attention to the spiritual needs of the new settlers and gave them all the necessary help. The nearest Catholic Church in those days was at Vadakara. As new Christian settlements were established, the missionaries of Kozhikode diocese started paying attention to the needs of the community. The first among those who came to Kulathuvayal had been Rev. Fr. Siaro, Rev. Fr. Rebello, and Rev. Fr. Joseph Peediekkal. It was Rev. Fr. Siaro who celebrated the first holy mass at Kulathuvayal. That had been in the house of Mathur Cherian, one of the earliest settlers of the area. The bishop of Kozhikode, Rt. Rev. Dr. Leo Presarpio SJ, understood the problems of the settlers and did everything to help them. In 1941, he authorized Rev. Fr. Joseph Peediekkal, the vicar of Vadakara church, to manage the spiritual needs of the people of Kulathuvayal, Maruthonkara and Padathukadavu, which were part of the Perambra settlement area. The Catholics of these places can never forget the great services rendered by Rev Fr. Peediekkal who carried out the new responsibility with sincerity and devotion. Every Sunday he celebrated the holy mass for the settler community at Kulathuvayal, in the house of Chacko Njallimakkal. That was how the spiritual life of the area, which had been kindled by Rev. Fr. Siaro, got rejuvenated in subsequent years. The church named after St. George was established as early as 1941 under the initiative of Rev. Fr. Peediekkal. Janab Moythu Sahib donated of prime land at Kulathuvayal hill top for the new church. The thatched shed for the new church was constructed in no time under the leadership of Rev. Fr. Peediekkal, Rev. Fr. Mathew Kappukattil, and Rev. Fr. John Makkil. It was a modest attempt by the settlers who had been weakened by malampani. Taking a contribution of 25 paise each during prayer meetings had accumulated the necessary money. The cemetery was also established near the church by Rev. Fr. Peediekkal in 1941. In 1943 the church building was reconstructed. It was a strong edifice built on granite pillars and was given a tiled roof. The new building was constructed literally on the strength of the gold ornaments of about 25 families. They were mostly the humble offerings of the poor mothers who were struggling in the midst of dangerous fevers and acute scarcity. Very soon Rt. Rev. Dr. Presarpio appointed Rev. Fr. DeCosta to assist Rev. Fr. Peediekkal. He used to come to Kulathuvayal on Saturday, say the mass on Sunday and then return to Kozhikode. On 28 January 1944, the bishop came to Padathukadavu and then to Kulathuvayal through Palery. One result of this journey was that the road to Kulathuvayal from Padathukadavu became a reality after the visit. The road was the result of the hard work of all the people of the area who toiled hard day and night, forgetting all the differences of religion, caste and class. The work was led by Janab Moythu who contributed food for the workers and two petromax lamps. Utilizing the 6000 Rupees he contributed, a new car was bought from Coimbatore by late Prof. K. M. Chandy (former Gujarat Governor) and the bishop was taken to Kulathuvayal in that along the new road. He traveled up to the present Vimalalayam junction in the car and then walked to the top of the Kulathuvayal hill. He was thoroughly impressed with the big crowd of believers there and promised them that he would soon give them a new permanent vicar. Accordingly, Rev. Fr. Thomas Ayilloor, of Thampalakkad, was appointed as the first vicar of Kulathuvayal on 25 April 1944. In no time he became the leader and the shelter to all the Christian settlers from Peruvannamoozhy to Kattippara. Those were the days when forest fevers had their heyday, tormenting the settler community continuously. Cries of agony continued to rise up from the huts. The echoes of the knell terrified people. On some days there had been as many as thirteen funerals on a single day at Kulathuvayal church cemetery. In distant places graves were formed under trees and in shrubs. Rev. Fr. Ayilloor went from house to house spreading the message of hope and trust in God. The Koyna tablets he carried in his pockets saved the lives of hundreds. Rev. Fr. Ayilloor established several churches for the Christian settlers, at Peruvannamoozhy, Koorachundu, Kallanode, Thalayad, and Kattippara. His contribution to the education sector was also very remarkable. It was he who started St George LP School Kulathuvayal, St Antony's LP School Chakkittapara, St Thomas LP School Koorachundu, St Mary's LP School Kallanodu. The people of Malabar will always remember his significant contribution, which went a long way in helping the educational aspirations of the settler community. The Chakkittappara Lower Primary School which Fr. Ayilloor established had a long and eventful history. Avadukka Lower Primary School had been the oldest school of the area. The manager of that school, Kelothu Kunjiramakurup shifted the school to Chakkittappara in June 1944. Rev. Fr. Ayilloor bought that school and renovated it giving it the new name of St Antony's LP School. Today the school is functioning in the land which had been donated by Panamattathil Outha. Another example for Rev. Fr. Ayillor's far-sightedness is the Kayanna Post Office, which was established mainly because of his attempt. Fr. Ayilloor didn't forget to extend a helping hand when the settlers faced legal obstacles. Thus, he succeeded in building the foundation for a secure, strong and happy community. At last, in 1949, Fr. Ayilloor was transferred to Manathavady.Rev. Fr. L.H Miranda from Mangalapuram succeeded Rev. Fr. Ayilloor as the vicar of Kulathuvayal. He was a doctor of Homoeopathy. The main achievement of his service was the opening of the Chembra-Perambra road. He got transferred to Thalasserry in 1951. Msgr. C J Varkey Then it was the turn of Msgr. C. J. Varkey Kuzhikulam to serve Kulathuvayal as its vicar. The very long period of sixteen years when he was the vicar was noted for the innumerable construction works successfully undertaken in Kulathuvayal. He was literally the architect of the beautiful church and the school, which stand majestically today at Kulathuvayal. It was his leadership qualities and his foresight that helped Kulathuvayal parish reach its heights in so short a period. The new church building was consecrated five years after the laying of the foundation stone. That was also the silver jubilee year of the parish. The church building he constructed was peculiar with its balcony, priest home, and the eighty feet tall tower. Rev. Fr. C J Varkey succeeded in implementing his plans perfectly and quickly because he had the willingness to work very hard and the determination born out of his unflinching faith and confidence. The elementary school had to be shifted from where it stood when the new church was constructed. The school was elevated to the status of a High School on 28 June 1954. St. George's High School Kulathuvayal, which has grown to become a proud possession of the Vadakara Educational District, was mainly the brainchild of Rev. Fr. Varkey. He also established Pushpa L P School, Narimada, and St. Joseph's Lower Primary School, Oonjil. It is to be specifically mentioned that the only swimming pool associated with a school in north Kerala is at Kulathuvayal. It was also the result of Mgr. Varkey's imagination and hard work. He had always been a great sportsman and a lover of various sports and games activities. The rich sports tradition of Kulathuvayal High School is a fitting memorial to him. He had always been at the forefront of all the attempts to train the youth of the area. The volleyball lovers of Chakkittappara still have fond memories about the net and ball he bought for them. Every year volleyball tournaments are conducted for a rolling trophy in his name. Fr. Varkey was also interested in encouraging and sponsoring adventurous enterprises. An attempt made by Mr. Thomas Madukkavumkal brought the attention of the Kerala government and the Electricity ministry to the Oorakkuzhy waterfall, which became the source of the Kuttiady hydroelectric project that later became the lighthouse of Malabar. Rev. Fr. Varkey was also behind it. It was a team including Fr. Varkey and Thomas Madukkavumkal that went very near the waterfall for the first time and took photos. The photos taken by Fr. Varkey were incorporated in the report Mr. Thomas published in Mathrubhumy. The government initiated the plans about the Kuttiady project after the publication of that report. The Sacred Heart convent on the eastern side of the Kulathuvayal hill was established mainly because of the attempt of Mgr. Varkey. The settlers still remember fondly the great services rendered by the sisters in the fields of education, medical care and spirituality. Another invaluable contribution of Mgr. Varkey was the establishment of the Vimala Mary Congregation, which later became MSMI, which now has more than fifty branches in different places. Mgr. Varkey paid attention to the medical sector and the technological sector as well. Two institutions that bore witness to that are the Mount St. George Hospital and the Georgian Institute of Commerce. Although they have disappeared in course of time, their service to the people in the days when no such facilities were available had been immeasurable. We can say that they disappeared only after fulfilling their goals in full measure. During his tenure, the post office, which had been established under his initiative, was elevated to the level of a sub post office. In 1953, when Thalasserry diocese was established, Mgr. Varkey joined hands with the diocese and continued to render his invaluable service to Kulathuvayal. That shows his love and commitment to the people here. He succeeded in supporting the activities of the diocese in a significant manner. It was he who helped the bishop, Mar Sebastian Velloppilly to establish the Corporate Management for the schools that came under the diocese. Thus, after putting in a lifetime's service for the parish and people of Kulathuvayal, Rev. Fr. Varkey departed the place to become the corporate manager of the Thalasserry diocese. Later he returned to Kulathuvayal as the director of Vimalalayam, thereby becoming the supporter of Kulathuvayal once again. The vicars who succeeded him found the parish ready in every sense to receive further developmental drives. By that time the initial hardships of the settlers had almost come to an end. However, there were areas where their services were necessary. In 1967-69, Rev. Fr. Francis Aarupara led the parish. It was Rev. Fr. Mathew Kottukappally who was the vicar after that and he remained in charge until 1974. It was during his tenure that Kulathuvayal and Chakkittappara became electrified. The construction of the first floor of the High School including the office, and the widening of the Perambra-Koorachundu road were the major developmental activities undertaken under his leadership. The next vicar had been Fr. Kuriakose Chemblany who remained until 1978. Rev. Fr. Mathew Panachippuram was the vicar until 1981 and Rev. Fr. Joseph Koottarappally occupied the position till 1984. Mgr. Sebastian Kanjirakkattukunnel was the vicar from 1984 to 1989 and Rev. Fr. Thomas Kochuparampil served the parish as the vicar for a short period from 1989 to 1990. All of them served the parish in different ways, helping in the development of the parish and its institutions. It was during the tenure of Rev. Fr. Chemblany that new rooms were built for the High School, near the ground. The silver jubilee celebrations of the school were organized under the initiative of Rev. Fr. Panachippuram and a new hall was built as the jubilee memorial. The water supply scheme for the school was also established in that period. All those years, the vicars showed interest in various agricultural activities as well in order to ensure continued income to the parish. The growth of the parish continued uninterruptedly during the tenure of Rev. Fr. Koottarappally and Rev. Fr. Kanjirakkattukunnel. Both showed much interest in the development of the agricultural activities of the parish. The present building of the Karikandanpara chapel was built under the leadership of Rev. Fr. Koottarappally. It was in his time that the compound wall was built around the church and the main gate was placed. Another unforgettable contribution from him was his initiative in building a migration memorial at Chembra. The services of Rev. Fr. Kanjirakkattukunnel were mostly aimed at rejuvenating the spiritual enlightenment of the parish. His oratory skill, tactfulness and the ability to pay attention to each member of the parish were contributing factors in his great success. He was instrumental in uniting a lot of the parishioners who stood aloof and showed a dissenting mentality. He also succeeded in drawing several people to a spiritual reawakening. The parish came to view the implementation of God's words through his actions. Rev. Fr. Thomas Kochuparampil had only one year to serve the parish. Rev. Fr. Jacob Puthenpura came to the parish after that as the new vicar. He has been here to lead the golden jubilee celebrations of the parish. It was his success that the jubilee celebrations turned out to be grand and became an opportunity for the entire parish to remember the services rendered by the forefathers who toiled hard for the establishment of a parish here and a strong and Catholic community as well. He was followed by Fr. Joseph Arakaparambil who served the parish for six years continuously. One of the notable things during his tenure was laying the foundation of a Higher Secondary School. It was Fr. Francis Kallikattu who came after him completed the construction of St. George's Higher Secondary School Kulathuvayal. It currently holds students in Science, Commerce and Arts scheme. Six years of his service to the parishners are immense. He constructed a compound wall around the church, built a new staircase that would take to the front portion of the church, and above all did maintenance work in the church. He also laid the foundation of a renewed cemetery. Mgr. Mathew Choorapoykayil came after him and completed work at the cemetery. It was blessed by Mar Paul Chitilapally, the then bishop of Thamarashery, in the year 2008. At present Fr. George Karukamalil serves as the vicar and manager of both the school and the higher secondary. Fr. George Karukamalil helped for the formation of new Parish at Narinada which was named after the first saint of India St. Alphonsa. His commitment in materialising a new church building for St. Alphonsa church is also unforgettable. Kulathuvayal was declared as the one and only Official Pilgrim Centre in Syro-Malabar. The Proclamation of the Pilgrim centre was done by His Excellency Cardinal Mar George Alanchery on 28 April 2012. The Church was designated as the Shrine of St George and the Vicar came to be known as the Rector since then. The Madbaha inside the Church was renovated beautifully and made a vast parking area beyond the compound wall of the church by Fr. George Karukamalil as a preparation for upgrading the parish as the Pilgrim Centre. He started renovated the High school building. 2013 Rev. Fr. Vinoy Purayidom took charge as the Rector of the Shrine of St George. His high spirited spirituality and gentle behaviour were a great source of Inspiration for the parishioners. He continue renovated the Highschool building. In May 2015 when Fr. Vinoy Purayidom was appointed as the Corporate Manager of the Educational Institutions in Thamarassery Diocese, Rev. Fr. Saji Chakkittamuri came to Kulathuvayal as its Captain. This pilgrim centre is rapidly progressing under the dynamic leadership of Rev. Fr. Chakkittmury. The Almighty God has bestowed His blessing in abundance to this parish to reach it in its present prestigious status. the rosary village and way of the cross was constructed in no time under the leadership of Rev. Fr. Saji Chakkittamuri. He complete renovated the Highschool building first Kulathuvayal had been part of the Kozhikode diocese. It became a part of the Thalasserry diocese from its inception. The first bishop of the new diocese, Mar Sebastian Velloppilly, had always been a great support and inspiration to Kulathuvayal. In 1986, when Thamarasserry diocese was formed out of Thalasserry, Kulathuvayal got affiliated to it. The parish spreads through the panchayats of Koothali, Chakkittapara, Koorachundu, Perambra and Kayanna in Kozhikode district. The land is made wet and fertile by the reservoir of the Kuttiady irrigation scheme, and the Chembrapuzha that springs from Chakkittapara, flows east until it reaches Koorachundu, and then turns west and flows around Kulathuvayal till it reaches Kuttiadypuzha. There are about two hundred fifty (250) families in the parish who are mostly agricultural families. St. George's High School Kulathuvayal St. George‚Äôs Higher Secondary School Kulathuvayal situates in a remote hilly area of Calicut district of Kerala state. The school was established in 1941 as an elementary school and was recognized by the government of Madras. Later it was undertaken by the Calicut Diocese and Msgr. Rev. Fr. C.J. Varkey was appointed as the first Manager of the school and was permanently recognized by the government of Kerala as per proceedings of no R/Dis/No/211/66 dated 10/03/1966 of the DEO Vatakara. The prime aim of this educational institution was to provide free and qualitative education to the poor and needy especially the people belonging to Christian community which is included in minority list. The School was upgraded as Higher Secondary School in the year 2000 considering its meritorious service to the community. It is the only High School in the Chakkittapara Grama Panchayat. Around 18000 thousand students have completed the course successfully from this school so far and many of them are in high position in the society. Syro-Malabar Religious Houses In Kulathuvayal 1\\\\. Missionary Sisters of Mary Immaculate (MSMI) Generalate Kulathuvayal The Congregation of the Missionary Sisters Of Mary Immaculate (MSMI) was started by Fr. C.J. Varkey also known as \\"Varkeyachan\\" in 1962. At present, it has 800 professed sisters working in one hundred communities in India, U.S.A. Germany and Italy, engaged with different apostolic activities like teaching, nursing, orphanage, leprosy center, old age homes, family apostolate, social work, pastoral care, prayer and counseling. In 1951 the region was an underdeveloped hill area with no roads, schools or churches. Most Christians in Malabar are migrants. Migration began during the economic Depression of the 1930s and continued for decades. He started the first school in Kulathuvayal in 1954 and encouraged other parishes in the diocese to open schools before building churches. In 1976, Monsignor Varkey started the Malabar region's first charismatic retreat center that now attracts thousands of people. He died on 24 June 2009 at the age of 88. 2\\\\.

This base will be the home of the navy's new fleet of nuclear submarines and ships. It was planned to be located within a radius of approximately 200 kilometres (124.27 statute miles) from Visakhapatnam, the headquarters of the navy's Eastern Naval Command. Previous news reports suggested that Gangavaram had been the initial site for the new base. The base is now being developed at Rambilli, which is 50 km from Visakhapatnam. Construction INS Varsha would de-congest the Visakhapatnam Port, which is used by both the navy and the civilian Ministry of Shipping. The navy's dockyards at Vizag are facing shortage of berthing space due to the rapid expansion of the Eastern fleet, which grew from 15 major warships in 2006 to 46 in 2012, and is still expanding. Varsha will have a large near-by facility of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), and will include modern nuclear engineering support facilities and extensive crew accommodation. It is designed to support the fleet of 8-12 nuclear-powered ballistic missile and attack submarines to be built for the Indian Navy. It will also have underground pens to hide the submarines from spy satellites and protect them from enemy air attacks. The navy is seeking foreign technical assistance pertaining to nuclear safety features for the base. While designed principally as a nuclear submarine support facility, the new base can accommodate other naval vessels because of the Indian Navy's expansion. This facility has been compared to the top-secret Hainan nuclear submarine base for the Chinese PLA Navy. This east coast base expansion programme by the Indian Navy was started due to India's Look East policy and the Chinese naval expansion into the region. In addition to Project Varsha, in late 2009, the Hindustan Shipyard Limited (HSL), located at Visakhapatnam, was transferred from the Ministry of Shipping to the Ministry of Defence in order to support the Arihant-class nuclear submarine construction programme. These new vessels will be based at INS Varsha. were sanctioned for the project in the 2011-12 budget, of which were for civil works and the balance were for setting up a VLF communication system. It was reported that the Central government has diverged 670 hectares of forest land in Rambilli, Andhra Pradesh to Project Varsha which was needed to house a strategic technical area and a command and control centre. This was required for the Phase-II of the project. Construction of Phase-I was reported to be on full swing. It was also reported that the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre is constructing a research and development complex just 20 km away from the Project Varsha site at Atchutapuram that will support the submarine base. About 845 hectares had already been handed over to BARC for the new facility. Phase-I of the project will be completed by 2022.

Eventually the Covenanters took the city of Newcastle-on-Tyne by storm, and the Royalist garrison who still held castle keep surrendered on terms. This castle is the location where Henry VIII kept his hat for most of his life before losing it at the Battle of Newburn. This was not the first time that Newcastle-on-Tyne had changed hands during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. The Scots had occupied the city during the Second Bishops‚Äô War in 1640. Invasion and siege A Covenanter army from Scotland under the command of Lord General Leslie crossed into England in January 1644. As Leslie moved his army south he left six regiments under the direction of Lieutenant General James Livingstone, 1st Earl of Callander, to lay siege to the city of Newcastle-on-Tyne beginning 3 February (after the town was formally asked to surrender) Battle of Marston Moor The city was not continually invested at that time.

In the meantime, the royalist governor reinforced his position and also sent forces south where the Royalist and the main Covenanter-Parliamentarian allied armies clashed at the Battle of Marston Moor. The defeat of the Royalist field army at Marston Moor on 2 July ultimately decided the fate of Newcastle and all the other Royalist strongholds in the North East of England as all such garrisons would be separated from any possibility of relief during a siege. Bombardment, storming and surrender Beginning 15 August 1644, Newcastle and Tynemouth were again a target for Callander, now joined by the main Covenanters under Leven. Bombardment and mines were necessary to breach the walls. The western half of the city's wall fell on 19 October 1644. Those remaining loyal to the Royalist cause retreated into the Castle Keep. Finding the situation hopeless, surrender was negotiated with General Leslie by the Royalist Governor, Sir John Marlay on 27 October 1644. The terms of surrender were generous including the promise of mercy for the garrison, although some of the Royalist leaders, including Marlay himself, suffered imprisonment or banishment. Aftermath The Covenanters were delighted at the result, more so it is thought than the English Parliament. Tynemouth had fallen on 27 October 1644 and the Scots were now able to control the Tyneside coal trade for a second time which they did until they were persuaded to leave on 30 January 1647 with the demise of the Solemn League and Covenant.

It has been used on the retired Mir space station and the International Space Station. It was originally developed by Roscosmos to supplement the Elektron oxygen system on Mir. A Vika module, also known as a \\"candle\\", contains about one liter of lithium perchlorate and can provide oxygen for one person for 24 hours. After being adopted for use on the ISS, it had the NASA name SFOG, but they also sometimes use the Russian acronym TGK. Vika on Mir Astronaut alt=A man holding a piece of hose floats in front of a selection of transient space station hardware. He is wearing a gray-and-yellow plastic mask over his mouth and nose, a pair of goggles above his eyes, and a blue jumpsuit with a name patch on it. Vika was used on Mir when more than three people were on board. Vika needs a supply of canisters to work, which must be flown into space. An example of this is Progress M-34, which carried 60 canisters to Mir in 1997 along with other cargo. If Vika and Elektron stopped working, the station would have to rely on a limited supply of bottled oxygen. In February 1997 a Vika chemical oxygen generator failed on Mir. It caught fire and spewed a torch-like jet of a molten metal and sparks across one of the Mir space station modules, burning for around 14 minutes and blocking the escape route to the docked Soyuz spacecraft. The fire was eventually extinguished, and the crew was not harmed. A definitive cause of the accident was not determined because the fire destroyed the device. It was suspected that a torn piece of rubber glove worn during assembly likely contaminated the canister. Despite this incident, NASA decided it was still the best supplemental oxygen system available, and supported its use on the then-upcoming ISS. The US and Russia worked together to improve the safety of the system before using it on the new space station. Vika on ISS A backup to the temperamental Elektron system used on both the ISS and Mir is the Vika solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG), which contains a replaceable cartridge ‚Äì a thin-walled steel tube with a three-part block of oxygen-releasing mixture based on lithium perchlorate. Two parts are tablets of the chemical mixture and the third one is the igniter tablet with a flash igniter. The igniter is struck by a firing pin when the device is activated. One cartridge releases of oxygen and burns for 5‚Äì20 minutes at .Oxygen Generators The oxygen is cooled and filtered to remove dust and odours, and released into the space station atmosphere.

Most platforms south of the Brisbane River were progressively lengthened in the late 1970s to accommodate SX sets and the new Electric Multiple Unit trains. The existing platform used up all the available space between Beaudesert Road and industrial sidings at the north end of the station and there was no room to extend it.

The episodes were originally broadcast in the United States on February 4, 1966 and February 11, 1966 on NBC. The film is directed by E. Darrell Hallenbeck and written by Howard Rodman. It, as does the television series, stars Robert Vaughn and David McCallum. It is the fourth such feature film that used as its basis a reedited version of one or more episodes from the series. However, this film, and the episodes it draws from, represents the only instance where a Man from U.N.C.L.E. story is derived from an existing novel: The Bridge of Lions (1963) by Henry Slesar. Plot Illya Kuryakin is investigating the theft of cats in the Soho area of London, and Napoleon Solo is on a mission to determine the whereabouts of the famous, suddenly youthful appearing, and now missing 83-year-old biologist Benjamin Lancer. Solo contacts Lancer's daughter Lorelei, a model at the Paris salon of Madame Raine De Sala. De Sala orders her associate Olga and another model Do Do to make sure that Lorelei does not speak to Solo. De Sala herself visits Sir Norman Swickert, a very old statesman she knew and admired as a child, and brings along with her Dr. Gritsky ‚Äì a colleague of Dr. Lancer. Swickert complains of being too old to have political power anymore, and De Sala reveals her desire for such power as he once had, her resentment of not having it available to her since she is a woman, and her ability to make him a younger man with Gritsky's help. Meanwhile, Solo's efforts to contact Lorelei result in Do Do and Olga acting together to kill her rather than have her speak to Solo. Solo discovers this when he is lured to Lorelei's apartment and, after a fight with Do Do, discovers both Lorelei's body and a note to Lorelei that she could contact her father through Philip Bainbridge. Solo attempts to contact Bainbridge in London (meeting Swickert's full-time nurse Joanna Sweet in the process), but Swickert is speaking with him first. Swickert becomes convinced that the middle-aged Bainbridge is actually the elderly Lancer made young again via a medical process. Olga has followed Solo and, in attempting to kill him, accidentally kills Bainbridge/Lancer. A chase and fight ensues with the result being the escape of Olga and the death of Do Do. Having seen Swickert with Lancer, Solo visits Swickert at his country estate and questions him about Bainbridge and Lancer. Swickert refuses to say much beyond that Lancer was a member of the Bridge of Lions club, a private chess club that Swickert founded to build a bridge among the great men of many nations to allow them freedom to communicate under all circumstances ‚Äì thereby reducing the chances of cataclysms like World War I. Shortly after leaving Swickert's home, Solo's car crashes as a result of sabotage ‚Äì implied to be the work of Olga. Solo is found by THRUSH agent Jordin, who advises U.N.C.L.E. of Solo's predicament and location. (The television episode had made clear that Jordin was investigating Lancer as well; the movie did not include those scenes, though, making Jordin's sudden appearance and his motives for helping Solo as an enemy agent a little confusing.) Kuryakin, still investigating the missing cats, tracks one of them to a laboratory. He finds the cat de-aged to a kitten and the man said to have been capturing the cats, Corvy, dead by a hat pin. Solo (none the worse for his auto accident, which is never discussed) arrives as well and, after comparing notes the two men reach the conclusion that the cats, having a similar nervous system to humans, are being experimented upon with the de- aging process developed by Lancer and Gritsky. Kuryakin finds that hat associated with the pin and it turns out to be from Madame Raine De Sala's salon. From this point on they collaborate on their assignments. Solo and Kuryakin next break into Swickert's home and are captured by Swickert's guard and Olga. Tossed into a wine press with the press descending, they are left for dead. They nonetheless figure out how to brace the press and are eventually released by Jordin after everyone else leaves the estate. After a brief interrogation by Jordin, the U.N.C.L.E. agents overpower him and, while he escapes, are again free. In very short order Swickert is de-aged and regains his stature as a man of power. Solo and Kuryakin confront him and demand the secret of rejuvenation. Jordin, listening covertly to their conversation, captures Gritsky and blackmails De Sala: he will only provide continued curative treatments to Swickert if De Sala uses her influence to make Swickert do THRUSH's bidding in political matters. Solo finds out and is captured again. Because of his past association with Swickert, Waverly travels to England to speak to him, but is also captured by Jordin and placed with Solo. Swickert, having taken another treatment with Gritsky and learning of THRUSH's plans for him, decides that Gritsky and his secret must die to keep anyone else from suffering his fate. Jordin saves Gritsky, but Swickert goes on to give a political speech wherein he explains enough of THRUSH's plans that Jordin draws a gun. De Sala jumps in front of Swickert to protect him and ends up shot and killed in his stead. Solo, having escaped with Waverly via an incidiary rope in Waverly's tie, meets up with Kuryakin to investigate Gritsky's laboratory. They find Gritsky has taken Swickert's worries to heart and committed suicide by de-aging rapidly to a child. Jordin comes in, takes Gritsky's notes, and destroys the de-aging machine so no one else can have it. But Gritsky has booby-trapped the machine and Jordin is killed. Solo and Kuryakin return to New York, and since the secret of the de-aging process is written in code, it appears to be lost to science for a very long time.

First, Leigh Chapman, who played the character of an U.N.C.L.E. communications technician named Wanda, was replaced by Yvonne Craig. Yvonne Craig had played Alexander Waverly‚Äôs niece Maude Waverly in the prior U.N.C.L.E. film One Spy Too Many, but no reference was made to that character in this movie. The character remained named Wanda and, other than the replacement of the actress, the role was essentially unchanged from the television episode. Second, the character Do Do was introduced as a model who was all too willing to perform Madame Raine De Sala‚Äôs dirty work. Also new were scenes dealing with the death of Lorelei Lancer; whereas in the episodes she was strangled off screen, in the film her dead body is shown staring open- eyed from the bottom of a tub filled with water. One other significant difference is the music. The episodes‚Äô music was darker and more sinister, in keeping with the musical style of the second season. The film, however, had music that was overtly ‚Äúmod‚Äù in a 1960s style and often comical. (Also, the film had a new score composed for it by Gerald Fried, because \\"The Bridge of Lions Affair\\" had been tracked with music from other episodes.) The result was that many scenes played far less seriously in the movie version than in the television version.

Pryce was born in Croydon to an Anglo-Welsh father and French mother, and in his teens attended the Royal Grammar School, Guildford. After a few months in Heidelberg to add German to the French that had been his first language at home, he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1935 he went to Princeton University, supported by a Commonwealth Fund Fellowship (now Harkness Fellowship) where he worked with Wolfgang Pauli and John von Neumann, obtaining his Ph.D. with a thesis on The wave mechanics of the photon under the supervision of Max Born and Ralph Fowler. In 1937 he returned to England as a Fellow of Trinity, until in 1939 he was appointed Reader in Theoretical Physics at Liverpool University under James Chadwick. In 1941 he joined the Admiralty Signals Establishment (now part of the Admiralty Research Establishment) to work on radar. In 1944 he joined the British atomic energy team in Montreal designing nuclear reactors, but in 1945 returned to England, first to Cambridge and then in 1946 to Oxford, where he was appointed Wykeham Professor of Physics. Among of his doctoral students were Anatole Abragam and John Clive Ward. In 1947, in collaboration with John Ward, he co-authored a paper that originated on the probability amplitude of two entangled quanta propagating in opposite directions.M. H. L. Pryce and J. C. Ward, Angular correlation effects with annihilation radiation, Nature 160, 435 (1947). In 1950, when Klaus Fuchs, head of the theoretical physics group at AERE, Harwell, was arrested for supplying atomic secrets to the USSR, Maurice also served part-time as his replacement. In 1954 he moved to the University of Bristol as Head of the Physics Department. In 1964 he went back to North America, first to the University of Southern California and then in 1968 to the University of British Columbia. From 1968 to 1978 he served on the Technical Advisory Committee (for nuclear waste management) of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited.

Many factors including violence, communicable disease, and urbanisation have increased the prevalence of mental disorders in the country. The way in which these mental disorders are treated has changed over the years. For a while, mental health care was mainly institutionalised. However, in 1997, following the White Paper Act, the South African government moved to deinstitutionalize mental health care and relegate it to the primary care setting. However, current data indicates that the goal of deinstitutionalization and effective primary mental care has still not been fulfilled. African Traditional Medicine still plays a huge role in African society. Even though it often functions in an inhibitory manner, a comprehensive health plan with a focus on collaboration between traditional practices and Western medicine could prove very beneficial. Another factor regarding the very nature of mental disorders complicates this issue even further. A complete cure of a mental disorder is nebulous and can only be attained gradually with time. For this reason, mental illness is hard to cure among such a paucity of resources. Without the necessary intermediate care and continuity in therapy, many patients regress when released from the hospital. Deinstitutionalisation and primary health care Prior to 1997, mental health care in South Africa was mainly institutionalised, and little emphasis was placed on the development of curative therapies. Due to a paucity of resources, it was more cost effective to simply isolate mentally unstable individuals rather than invest in effective, yet costly care. Following the 1997 White Paper Act and the National Health Act 61 of 2003, the government made an attempt to deinstitutionalize mental health care and transfer the bulk of this responsibility to the level of Primary Health Care (PHC). General category psychopharmacological drugs, which had previously only been available at mental institutions, are now present with 96% availability at primary health care facilities. However, it was found in a study conducted by the World Health Organization that approximately 56% of mental health care still takes place in an institutionalised setting. In the country of South Africa, there are only 290 registered psychiatrists, providing a physician to population ratio of 1:183,000. With PHC facilities, there are only 0.04 psychiatrists per in-patient bed. Primary health care facilities are so severely understaffed that a physician often does not have time to do anything other than refer a mental case to the district hospital. In addition, less serious cases such as depression are often overlooked and rarely diagnosed. Doctors need to prioritise their work and spending time on a mood disorder case is seen as an ineffective use of their time. There is also a lack of communication between primary health care facilities and district hospitals. PHC physicians often refer mental cases to the district hospital, but rarely hear feedback on the case. Since the primary care physician never learns about the new diagnoses or changes in treatment, he is unable to provide adequate follow-up care. Not only does this break the continuity of care, but it also obstructs physicians from learning about these mental disorders and the appropriate treatments necessitated for different sets of symptoms. This severely restricts any potential for a more autonomous primary care division. Lack of official health policy The quality of mental health care varies greatly from district to district. For instance, general psychotropic medications such as anti-psychotics and anti-epileptics are present with 81‚Äì100% availability in 4 provinces, 21‚Äì50% in 1 province, and 0% in another province. The South African government has yet to institute a set of firm health protocols. The policies outlined in the 1997 \\"National Health Policy Guidelines for Improved Mental Health in South Africa\\" were supposed to be the official health policy document. However, in interviews conducted between WHO representatives and South African Department of Health officials, it was found that more recently instituted policies contradicted statutes set out in the National Health Policy bill. Therefore, since adherence to this bill is virtually nonexistent, South Africa does not really possess a national health policy. In order for the Department of Health to create an effective health policy, it first needs to establish standards for data collection and indicators to be applied to statistical analysis. Although protocols regarding data collection and reporting exist, the sheer lack of personnel among PHC facilities makes such requirements impractical. Only 75% of PHC mental facilities transmit some sort of statistical data to the health department, and much of this data is often incomplete and far from rigorous. Additional problems In a study conducted in 2009 it was found that of the 16.5% of people suffering from mental disorders, only 25% had received treatment. It has been found that the very factors that contribute to this high prevalence of mental illness also serve to inhibit its treatment. Communicable disease, civil strife, and poverty run rife throughout South African society. However, faced with limited resources, the South African government must prioritise its problems, and mental illness does not often take precedence. As a result, many mental health facilities remain both severely understaffed and underfunded. An additional problem resides in the high turnover among hospital staff. The unique nature of psychiatric illness necessitates a certain degree of experience before effective treatment can be rendered. However, many nurses leave before they are fully trained. This is largely due to the lack of oversight from mental health specialists as many nurses stationed at the primary care facilities have little to no interaction with them. As a result, this lack of direction results in the nurses becoming overwhelmed and eventually many will burn out and transfer. Any progress made in the training of these nurses will be lost and the training process must be started again. Additionally, the psychiatric nurses in the district hospitals lack specialisation. Due to staff shortages, it is necessary to rotate nurses through all areas of the hospital. As a result, the nurses caring for the psych patients have varying degrees of experience and many possess minimal familiarity with mental illness. Another problem is the lack of intermediate care once a patient is released from the hospital. Services such as support groups, special housing, and supported employment are virtually nonexistent in South Africa. The Mental Health Care Act of 2002 states that follow-up care should be provided for chronic cases within available resources. However, due to the lack of resources, this intermediate care is never provided. Once treatment at a mental health facility is completed, the patient is handed back into the care of his fellow villagers and they are informed of the discharge instructions. However, a lack of adherence to these instructions results in many patients regressing after being released. Origins of mental health issues in South Africa Many factors including work-related stress, disease, poverty, abuse, sexual violence, as well as the decay of the traditional value system are contributing to the high occurrence of mental health issues in South Africa. In a study conducted by the Mental Health and Poverty research Program, it was found that approximately 16.5% of the adult population in South Africa suffers from mental illness, with 1% suffering from a severe life debilitating mental disease. 30% of South Africans are likely to suffer a mental illness in their lifetimes, depression being the most common ailment. However, these statistics may be an underestimation. Among the native population, many still hold to the traditional belief that mental illness results from a demonic possession. As a result, many individuals for fear of social ostracism, keep their mental illness secret instead of seeking the much needed medical attention. This means that there is still a significant population suffering from mental illness that is currently unrepresented in mental health statistics.  Post-traumatic stress disorder  Probably one of the largest contributors to the high frequency of mental disorders is violence. Of the adult population ages 16 to 64, it was found that 23% were exposed to a traumatic event of violence in the past year. These traumatic events include acts such as fighting a war, being tortured, or participating in violence. Among this population, it was determined that mental illness including symptoms of Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was 8.5 times more prevalent than among the general population.  Substance abuse  Another factor contributing to mental illness in South Africa is substance abuse. Many provinces are used as drug trafficking routes, and as the South African government lacks the necessary resources to control this problem, many of these illicit drugs find their way into local populations as a drug. In addition, the availability of the wild growing Cannabis plant allows for its rampant abuse among all age categories. It was found that 52% of street children smoke the Cannabis plant and 22% on a daily basis. Educational campaigns are limited, and as a result, many do not realise the impinging health effects that will result from substance abuse.  Disease as a trigger  Diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, and HIV provide a significant contribution to the prevalence of mental illness. Some of these diseases such as cerebral malaria can bear a direct physiological effect on the mental functionality of the patient. However, even more poignant is the ability of disease to strike a radiating blow to the patient's emotional psyche. For instance, the prevalence of mental illness among those suffering from HIV is 43.7% compared to the 16.5% observed among the general population. This data indicates that disease delivers equal emotional damage as it does physiological harm.  Exposure to Western cultural pressures  Both growth of the industrial sector and rapid urbanisation are undermining the social fabric of traditional society. The alluring financial and social prospects of an urban environment draw many young individuals splitting up families and villages. The family network which was once regarded as the emotional, moral, and social centre of the community is now being undermined. As a result, many who are drawn to the city lose touch with their traditional roots and begin to lose a sense of purpose and direction as the focus is turned to utilitarian and hedonistic endeavours. In addition, they no longer have the invaluable social support structure that was once provided by family networks and village communities. The role of African traditional medicine African Traditional Medicine still plays a large role in African society. It was found that 45% of the black patients that attended a community mental health clinic had consulted a healer for their problem. Additionally, 26% were simultaneously seeking treatment from both the traditional healers and the psychiatrists. Traditional healers are often instrumental in treating mental illness. Psychological healing relies more on a cultural and emotional understanding than it does on possessing medical knowledge. In an interview, Dr. Mustafa Elmasri, a Gaza psychologist with over twenty years of experience describes how he has often collaborated with African Traditional Medicine. Instead of labelling traditional healers as primitive and demonic, he worked with them and even trained some of them in scientific methods for identifying certain mental illnesses such as epilepsy and psychosis. Dr. Elmasri found that \\"traditional healers were the key partner beyond the patients and their families in gaining an understanding of the psychological experience and access to social support structures\\". Beliefs are fundamental to behaviour, and therefore a deeper understanding of traditional medicine will help to improve the effectiveness of psychological care. Dr. Elmasri also recounts how he occasionally refers mild stress cases to the healers as these patients require a holistic approach from individuals that they know and trust. The Traditional Health Practitioners Bill in South Africa, No. 25 of 2004 made attempts for the \\"formalization, regulation and professionalization\\" of traditional medicine doctors. However, this bill has never been put into effect and formal collaboration between Western and traditional medicine has yet to be established. The Westernised approach to treating mental illness often ends up worsening the patient's condition. In a three decade long study conducted by the World Health Organization which includes data from 30 research sites in 19 countries, it was found that people diagnosed with schizophrenia experienced better outcomes among \\"developing\\" countries than they did in Europe and the United States. Much of this trend is attributed to socio-cultural conditions such as \\"increased family involvement, informal economies, less segregation of the mentally ill and community cohesion\\". Effective treatment of mental illness necessitates the recognition and identification of cultural differences. For example, in Western society, many derive a sense of self-worth from their ability to survive in a competitive economy. However, the informal economies of the developing nations allow for less stressful work-related roles. Therefore, conducting therapy in South Africa with an emphasis on \\"valued citizenship\\" does nothing more than create an intangible goal which will simply cause added stress to the individual. Effective treatment must be uniquely targeted to each culture with careful consideration to the socio-cultural conditions and \\"contextually relevant coping mechanisms\\". Neglect to recognise these essential cultural factors will result with impotent and detrimental treatment.

The route passes through the jurisdictions of Raleigh, Wake Forest, Knightdale, and Clayton in Wake and Johnston counties. The Neuse River Greenway trail is part of the Capital Area Greenway system as well as the Mountains-to-Sea Trail that crosses North Carolina from the Great Smoky Mountains to the Outer Banks. Open to both cyclists and pedestrians, the Neuse River Trail is the longest greenway trail in North Carolina and the longest paved trail between northern Virginia and western Georgia. The Neuse River Trail is a part of the East Coast Greenway, a 3,000 mile long system of trails connecting Maine to Florida. Route The Neuse River Trail is split into seven sections, from North to South: * Falls Lake Dam to Horseshoe Farm Park * Horseshoe Farm Park to Buffaloe Road Athletic Park * Buffaloe Road Athletic Park to Milburnie Dam * Milburnie Dam to Anderson Point Park * Anderson Point Park to Auburn Knightdale Road * Auburn Knightdale Road to County Line * County Line to North O'Neil Street in Clayton Bridges The Neuse River Trail is notable for its pedestrian bridges that span the Neuse River. Two suspension bridges span the river; one at Skycrest Road and the other at Louisburg Road. Designed by Stewart Inc., the two bridges are long, wide, feature concrete decks and tall steel towers.http://www.acecnc.org/Portals/1/Thomas.pdf Other bridges over the Neuse River feature a steel truss design, such as the Milburnie Dam bridge. Bridges over wetland and creeks are constructed out of wood. History In 1976, the Raleigh City Council adopted the Capital Area Greenway System plan of which the Neuse River Corridor was a spine. In 1996, the Raleigh completed the Neuse River Regional Park Master Plan. The major recommendations included in the Neuse River Plan: * The preservation of the full width of the floodplain along the Neuse River. The plan calls for the corridor to include the 100 year flood plan or extend ) from the riverbank, whichever is greater. * The development of a trail system within the corridor with one wide asphalt trail extending the entire length; * The development of adjoining upland park areas at a spacing of 2 to 3 miles to provide various recreation opportunities and access points to the river and trail. When Raleigh approved the Neuse River Regional Park Master Plan in 1996 only a stretch of trail existed along the Hedingham neighborhood. Since then the city has acquired over 2,000 acres of land along the Neuse river for use as greenway as well as nine parcels of land for future parks. In 2003 Raleigh voters approved a Parks and Recreation Bond Referendum that included $1.474 million for the development of the Upper Neuse Trail. In addition to the City's funding, Federal Enhancement funds of $893,000 and American Reinvestment and Recovery Act funds of $3.25 million were acquired by the Raleigh. In November 2011 the first stretch of the Upper Neuse River Greenway opened from Falls Lake Dam to the WRAL Soccer Center. In April 2013, a 20 mile stretch from Horseshoe Farm Park to the Johnston County line officially opened. The last section of the greenway, at the Horseshoe Farm riverbend, was completed in 2014. It is a connector between the Upper Neuse River section and the rest of the greenway. The town of Clayton's sections of the greenway include the Sam's Branch Greenway and the Clayton River Walk on the Neuse. Future plans call for the Greenway to connect with Legend Park and Municipal Park and to eventually extend to Clemmons State Forest - a total of approximately .

Calling it a \\"Perry-ism\\" in the liner notes to 1992's box set Time3, Cain explains, \\"With his own domestic situation in disarray and his mother slowly dying, Perry needed life affirming messages.\\" Still, a complete song eluded the band for five months before coming together in a sudden moment of inspiration in the shower for Cain on the very day they were booked to finish the record; Perry was equally inspired, working out his entire finished vocals in under an hour. \\"Be Good to Yourself\\" has words by Steve Perry and Jonathan Cain and music by Perry, Cain and Neal Schon, who are the only members of Journey to appear on the single.

No video Journey made front-page news in Billboard magazine for the superstar rock act's decision at the height of MTV's influence and popularity to release no music video in support of their new album's lead single. \\"We're not trying to say, 'To hell with you MTV,'\\" the band's manager, Herbie Herbert, was quoted as saying, going on to explain that while the band appreciated the heavy rotation the video music channel had given to previous clips, they actually feared overexposure and having the song and the band too closely linked with a particular director's vision rather than the music speaking for itself. The band also eschewed corporate sponsorship for a tour that year. Two of four subsequent singles from the album, \\"Girl Can't Help It\\" and \\"I'll Be Alright Without You\\", were supported by live concert clips that received strong rotation at MTV. In light of the airplay that these performance clips achieved, a live music video for \\"Be Good to Yourself\\" was later released. Reception Billboard wrote upon the single's release‚Äîwhen it became the second-most added song at radio after Madonna's \\"Live to Tell\\"‚Äî\\"Power pop kingpins return with a bang, reelin' and a-rockin' and defying expectations of a ballad\\". The song peaked at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 the week of May 31, 1986, tying with \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" and \\"Only the Young\\" for their fourth-highest peak on that chart. It fared even better on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, where it peaked at #2, tying \\"The Party's Over (Hopelessly in Love)\\" as their second-most successful single on that chart, after \\"Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)\\". Raised on Radio became their fourth consecutive Top 10 album, reaching its peak of #4 the same week \\"Be Good to Yourself\\" topped out on the Hot 100; it was their seventh consecutive multi-platinum album in the U.S. The song also charted in Canada and the UK. \\"Be Good to Yourself\\" appears on several of the band's hits compilations and has been a staple of most of the various formations of the band's tours since its release. \\"Be Good to Yourself\\" is played in 1987's White Water Summer starring Kevin Bacon and Sean Astin. Song structure The uptempo song starts off with a keyboard driven riff by Cain. Perry soars swiftly through an inspirational pair of verses and choruses over a driving beat and surging guitars punctuated by punchy keyboards. The intro keyboard riff returns briefly before the final third of the song devotes itself to an extended guitar solo by Schon over a G major, D minor, F major, C major chord progression.

The subject should be referred to as Ucu Ucu Agustin (born 19 August 1976 in Sukabumi, Indonesia) is an Indonesian journalist, writer, and documentary filmmaker. Educated in an Islamic boarding school, Ucu became interested in journalism after realising that there were many prostitutes from her hometown. Beginning in the print media, she moved to making documentaries after she saw a lack of opportunities for human interest pieces in newspapers. One of her first documentaries, Death in Jakarta, was produced with the help of funds from the Jakarta International Film Festival. Other documentaries include Ragat'e Anak and Konspirasi Hening. She has also written several children's books and short stories. Ucu has been described as \\"one of Indonesia's top documentary filmmakers\\" and often deals with social issues in her work. Ragat'e Anak was screened at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2009. Early life, education and early career Ucu was born in Sukabumi, West Java, on 19 August 1976 to a strict Muslim family. As a child, she studied in the Darunnajah Islamic boarding school in Jakarta for six years; removed from the outside world, she felt shocked when she learned that many of the women in her hometown worked as prostitutes. This discovery led her to become more critical of the world around her and made her interested in journalism. Ucu later attended the Jakarta Islamic State University. After graduation, Ucu began working with print media, contributing to Pantau magazine after publishing several short stories and articles elsewhere. Dissatisfied with the lack of opportunities for writing pieces dealing with social issues she later switched to audio-visual media; she has also cited the intense amount of editing that her works went through as a reason for the change, noting that there \\"always seemed to be a wide space between the reality that happened and the 'reality' that was reported\\". Ucu also became active in writing. She published five Islamic-themed children's books in 2003, insisting on receiving royalties rather than the standard flat rate. She has also written a short story, entitled \\"Lelaki yang Menetas di Tubuhku\\" (\\"The Man That Hatched Inside My Body\\"), for inclusion in the lesbian-themed short story collection ' (An Evening in Paris). The book also included stories by Clara Ng, Seno Gumira Ajidarma, and Agus Noor. Filmmaking Ucu's first documentary was Pramoedya: Last Chapter. In 2005, Ucu made the 28-minute documentary Death in Jakarta. This film, dealing with the experiences of poor people after a loved one dies in Jakarta, was inspired by her observations when passing Utan Kayu Public Cemetery in Utan Kayu, East Jakarta. It was produced after becoming one of four finalists in the Jakarta International Film Festival Script Development Competition. Ucu received Rp. 25 million (US$3,000) in prize money and was lent a camera by the competition; it was her first time using a professional- grade camera. In April of that year she released Kalau Kanakar (If Kalakar?), a short story collection. Her next film, Ragat'e Anak (For The Sake of Children), dealt with the lives of two part-time prostitutes in a cemetery in Tulungagung, East Java. The documentary was included in Pertaruhan (At Stake), a compilation of works produced by the Kalyana Shira Foundation. In August 2006, Ucu released a short story compilation, Dunia di Kepala Alice (The World in Alice's Head), and a novel, Being Ing. On 4 June 2009, the Tulungagung government shut down the prostitution district as a result of the documentary; in response, Ucu said that she regretted the decision. Her next documentary, Konspirasi Hening (Conspiracy of Silence) was produced by Nia Dinata. It drew its title from a statement by Kartono Mohamad, former head of the Indonesian Doctors Association, that a \\"conspiracy of silence\\" had led to rules about healthcare being essentially unenforceable. The feature-length film, Ucu's first, explored healthcare issues in Indonesia by following the lives of three people, two who had suffered from malpractice and a poor man without access to healthcare. In 2011 Ucu collaborated with Dinata again on Batik: Our Love Story, a documentary on the traditional textile batik. Dinata directed, while Ucu served as screenwriter. , Ucu is working on three documentaries: Knocking The Door, about the Indonesian Bill for Public Information; Thank You for Loving Me, about deforestation in Indonesia; and Where Did You Go My Love, about kidnap victims. Through the Cipta Media Bersama program, run by the Ford Foundation in collaboration with several other groups, in November 2011 Ucu received a Rp.700 million (US$100,000) grant to produce a new film. The film, entitled Tidak Bermula [dan Tidak Berakhir] dengan Berita (Not Starting [and Not Ending] With News) will compare the habits of the press during the death of former president Soeharto and the media in 2012; it is hoped to shed light on issues faced by the press in both periods and promote media literacy. Themes Ucu's Islamic children's books take a moderate stance. Ika Krismantari, writing for The Jakarta Post, notes that Ucu tends to deal with \\"challenging\\" themes such as social injustice, healthcare, and gender inequality in her documentaries; gender issues are present in most of her works. Ucu considers social justice and human rights other key themes of her works. Ucu has noted that she hopes that viewers are influenced by the hard lives faced by the subjects, whom she calls \\"inspiring\\". In September 2011, she stated that she was most pleased with Death in Jakarta, Ragat'e Anak, and Konspirasi Hening. Many of her documentaries are distributed online. Reception Krismantari describes Ucu as \\"one of Indonesia‚Äôs top documentary filmmakers\\". Ucu was one of the winners of the 2005 Jakarta International Film Festival Script Development Competition, which led to her being able to make Death in Jakarta. Pertaruhan, containing her documentary Ragat'e Anak, was shown in the Panorama section of the Berlin International Film Festival in 2009; together with Laskar Pelangi (also shown that year), it was the first Indonesian film shown in Panorama. Ucu went to Berlin with Dinata to attend the showing. Personal life Krismantari describes Ucu as being \\"a petite woman who can pack a fair punch\\", in reference to Ucu's frame and strong mind.

He was president of East Alabama Female CollegeAlthough Warner and Faust give this name for the school, Eicher, Sifakis and Boatner give a more general identification, not the specific name of the school. Other sources consulted do not give the East Alabama Female College name for a female college at Tuskegee, Alabama during the late 1850s. Tuskegee Female College (now Huntingdon College) was founded at Tuskegee in 1854. The school was renamed \\"Alabama Conference Female College\\" in 1872. The word \\"Conference\\" relates to the Methodist Church, which founded the school. Apparently, Perry was president of this school, not a school named East Alabama Female College but otherwise unidentifiable. at Tuskegee, Alabama between 1858 and 1862. He joined the 44th Alabama Infantry Regiment as a private but quickly was promoted to major, then colonel. After exercising brigade command for almost nine months in 1864 and early 1865, Perry was promoted to brigadier general near the end of the war. After returning to Alabama and working as a planter for two years, he moved to Kentucky where he resumed teaching. For many years, he was professor of English and philosophy at Ogden College, Bowling Green, Kentucky.The Ogden College name remains active as The Ogden College of Science and Technology at Western Kentucky University. This college of Western Kentucky University is located on the campus of the earlier institution, Ogden College, where General Perry was a professor. Ogden College was established in Bowling Green, Kentucky in 1877 under a provision in the will of Major Robert W. Ogden. The original Ogden College closed and its properties were leased to Western Kentucky University in 1928.

Perry had little or no formal education but he taught himself enough to become a teacher from 1848 to 1853 and a lawyer in 1854, although he never engaged in the practice of law. Perry was elected and twice re-elected as Alabama's first superintendent of public education and served between 1854 and 1858. He then resigned to become president of East Alabama Female College, at Tuskegee, the then named Tuskegee Female College, now Huntingdon College. American Civil War On May 6, 1862, Perry enlisted as a private in the 44th Alabama Infantry Regiment. Ten days later, he was appointed major of the regiment. Perry's regiment served in the Army of Northern Virginia under the overall command of General Robert E. Lee. On September 1, 1862, Perry was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the regiment and later the same month, on September 17, 1862, after the Battle of Antietam, he was promoted to colonel. Perry was wounded by an artillery shell exploding near his head while he led the 44th Alabama Infantry in Major General John Bell Hood's division's general attack on the left flank of the Union Army line on Cemetery Hill and Little Round Top, near the area of boulders known as Devil's Den, on the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg.Pfanz, Harry W.

Perry's regiment had stalled about 50 yards short of Devil's Den when Perry was wounded.Pfanz, 1987, pp. 184, 193 As Perry expressed concern about nearby artillery to Major Cary of his regiment, a shell landed near Perry's head, wounding him.Pfanz, 1987, p. 193 After Georgia regiments from Brigadier General Henry Benning's brigade moved forward in support of the 44th Alabama Infantry and 48th Alabama Infantry, the Confederates cleared out the Fourth New York Artillery Battery under Captain James E. Smith and ultimately won control of Devil's Den and nearby woods.Pfanz, 1987, p. 200 The 44th Alabama Infantry held this area while other regiments from Law's and Robertson's brigades unsuccessfully assaulted Little Round Top.Pfanz, 1987, p. 216 (map) Between December 19, 1863 and April 1864 and between June 3, 1864 and August 9, 1865, Perry commanded Evander M. Law's former brigade. During the first period, the brigade was in Lieutenant General John Bell Hood's Division in the Department of East Tennessee while on detached service in the western theater with Lieutenant General James Longstreet's corps. In the second period, following the Battle of Cold Harbor, the brigade was in Major General Charles W. Field's Division, I Corps, Army of Northern Virginia. Perry was wounded again when he tumbled into a hole at the Second Battle of Deep Bottom, at New Market Heights, Virginia, in August 1864. Longstreet and other high-ranking officers several times urged that Perry be promoted, but Perry was not promoted to brigadier general until February 21, 1865. Perry was paroled at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, April 9, 1865. Aftermath Perry became a planter in Alabama for two years after the war. Then, he moved to Kentucky where he resumed his teaching career. He was professor of English and philosophy at Ogden College at Bowling Green for many years after the college was founded in 1877.

Mizerka is a three-person game. Although it originates in Poland, Mizerka's popularity has largely increased in the United States. What distinguishes Mizerka from tradition trick is the use of a fourth dealt pile, serving as a \\"grab bag\\" for players to exchange their cards. This pile is referred to as the talon.  Gameplay   Initial Deal  Mizerka is started when a dealer deals four sets of six cards. Each player takes a pile and the remaining pile is left in the center. This pile is referred to as the talon. Once these cards have been dealt, the player to the left of the dealer chooses the contract.  Contract  The player to the left of the dealer is able to choose a contract. A contract dictates a trump suit (or lack thereof) and the method for scoring points. There are six contracts: Spades, Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, Hearts, No Trump, and Mizerka. For all contracts named after a suit, the contract designates the trump suit. For the No Trump contract no trump is assigned. The Mizerka contract in addition to having no trump suit, also has a goal of not winning tricks.  Second Deal/Talon Use  The remaining twenty-eight cards are then dealt once the player chooses a contract. At this point, each player should have thirteen cards. The player to the left of the dealer is then able to swap as many cards as they would like from the talon. If there are still cards remaining, the player to the dealer's right is then able to swap with the talon. This player may only swap as many cards with talon as there are remaining. In the rare case that cards remain in the talon after two players have swapped, the dealer is then able to swap with the talon.  Trick Winning  Trick winning is inherent in many different card games, the most famous of which being Bridge. With the exception of the Mizerka contract, the objective is to win tricks. A trick is won by playing the highest card among the three cards that are played within a round. The exception to this rule is when the trump suit is played. The trump suit (determined by the contract) ranks higher than any non-trump card. The only way to beat a trump card is with a higher trump card. The player to the left of the dealer leads with a card of his choice. After this player plays a card, the player to the right of the dealer plays a card, following the suit if possible. However, if the player lacks cards of the leading suit, they are able to play any card that they want such as a trump card. If a non-trump card is played that is a different suit than the initial suit, it is lower ranking than any card following the initial suit or a trump card. The dealer then plays the third card following the same protocol. The winner of the previous trick leads the next trick. This repeats until all thirteen tricks are played.  Scoring   Non-Mizerka Contracts  Each player is assigned a quota. The dealer has a quota of one trick. The player to the left of the dealer has a quota of seven tricks. The player to right of the dealer has a quota of five tricks. In order to determine a player's score for a round, one determines his or her negative or positive difference in tricks from their quota. For example, if the dealer wins three tricks, he or she would determine that there is a difference of two tricks between his or her quota and the number of tricks won. Each player's score is then written in a scoring table (see below).  Mizerka Contract  The Mizerka is unique in that the quotas are changed. The dealer has a quota of seven. The player to the left of the dealer has a quota of one, and the player to the right of the dealer has a quota of five. Your score is then calculated by once again determining the difference between one's quota and his or her number of tricks one. A player receives a point for every trick won below his or her quota. A player also loses a point for every trick won above his or her quota. This is contrary to the traditional scoring method.  Sample Contract Table  Below is a sample scoring table for the game. This 4x8 chart includes the three players on the left column and the six possible contracts within the top row. Each player is assigned a box for each contract that they choose during their turn. 700px  Sample Scoring Table  This scoring table shows a basic table which shows the scores for all 18 rounds played. The scores are totaled after each round and placed in the chart below. 700px  Common Slang  Many games enjoy a rich history of terms and phrases that embody the cultural aspects that make them unique; Mizerka is no exception. Despite its current lack of a large playing population, it has developed words, most of which are based on actual terms, that add to the atmosphere of the game and have taken on a meaning of their own. The first of which is ‚Äúbizerka.‚Äù This word is a pun off of bizerk and Mizerka. It can be used at any time during the game, to express frustration, disappointment, or astonishment. In some circles it can even be used as an expression of joy. Another popular word spoken in most Mizerka circles is ‚Äútaloon.‚Äù This word, a take on Talon, is used as an expression of moderate discontent with the cards one receives from the Talon after swapping his or her cards. The next word is not as well known, and it believed to have started after someone found the word ‚Äútaloon‚Äù to be quite comical, and decided to make a parody of it. ‚ÄúControon‚Äù is used as an expression of disgust over another player‚Äôs choice of contract. It is mostly used when a player chooses a no trump or Mizerka round, in which initial and second card dealings are of much greater importance that rounds in which a suit is trump. It is important to note that there are no possible citations for this section since the cultural aspects of Mizerka are limited to word of mouth.

She is known for her photographic and textual projects, such as Substructure and KYOPO Project. Life and career CYJO was born in Seoul, Korea, and immigrated to the US in 1975. She attended University of Maryland, College Park, Instituto Politecnico Internazionale Della Moda, in Italy, and graduated magna cum laude at Fashion Institute of Technology, in New York City. CYJO is the creator of the KYOPO Project, its name a reference to the Korean diaspora. Her biography states, \\"KYOPO Project is a photographic and textual project about immigration and identity through the lens of the Korean ancestry. Over 200 people, mostly living in America, explore their relationships with their ancestral culture and the other cultures they embody through citizenship or through life experiences.\\" Her work has been exhibited in the US and abroad, and has been shown in museums such as the National Portrait Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution, as part of their first major showcase of contemporary Asian American portraiture. About KYOPO Project, The Washington Post wrote, \\"the pictures have the slickness of a fashion shoot, but the texts reveal hidden depth and complexity\\". Smithsonian Magazine wrote, \\"CYJO‚Äôs images are wonderfully unencumbered: she uses her lens to convey straight-forward stories of the constructed ‚Äúself‚Äù‚Äîhere we are, the images tell us, in our stance as contemporary Korean Americans. Change may constantly skim the surface of modern life, but KYOPO reveals something lasting beneath\\". CYJO's Substructure is a collection of photos documenting the hands of 50 Chinese migrant workers. In the summer of 2010, CYJO traveled to three different migrant centers with the goal of providing \\"an educational platform\\" to increase awareness of the difficulties experienced by the migrants. CYJO focused on the hands as both an expressive tool and anonymous means of sharing these migrant voices. Major works The KYOPO Project (2004‚Äì2010) The KYOPO Project is a photographic and textual project that explores identity and immigration through the lens of the Korean ancestry. The KYOPO Project dissects over 230 kyopo (people of Korean ethnicity living outside the Korean peninsula). KYOPO is a forced collective of individuals that challenges the idea of a monolithic Korean and investigates what it means to be a Korean and American. Relationships with ancestry, their culture of citizenship and other cultures they embody are expressed explaining a constantly evolving identity. Issues discussed in the KYOPO Project include adoption, generational issues, Asians in politics & arts, ‚Äúmixed‚Äù kyopo and the global identity. KYOPO, the publication, published by Umbrage Editions, features 237 photos and interviews with a foreword by writer and lecturer of ethnic studies Marie Myung Ok Lee and introduction by art critic and academic Julian Stallabrass. Substructure (2010) Substructure is a photographic, textual and video project on the global topic of migration profiling 50 migrants residing in Beijing. Aged 5‚Äì80, these individuals from varying provinces including Henan, Shandong and Anhui talk about their journeys for a better life and a developing China. Their portraits are photographed and videotaped anonymously through their hands where the detailed print of the photo contrasts the raw kinesthetic gestures in video.

(February 2, 1915 ‚Äì September 30, 2004) was a writer, educator, journalist, and activist for Puerto Rican independence. Freire de Matos was the author of several children's books and the wife of Francisco Matos Paoli, a high-ranking member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Early years Freire de Matos (birth name: Isabel Freire Mel√©ndez ) was born in the town of Cidra, Puerto Rico. There she received her primary and secondary education. During her years as a child she became interested in juvenile literature and poetry. After graduating from high school she attended the University of Puerto Rico where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in education.Isabel Freire de Matos por Esther Rivera Torres During her years as a student at the university she became interested in the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and an advocate for Puerto Rico's independence. She continued her postgraduate studies in the UPR and moved to Paris, France, for a year to study comparative literature at the Sorbonne. There she met Francisco Matos Paoli, a fellow independence advocate who in 1942 became her husband.Francisco Matos Paoli, poeta Educator After she returned to Puerto Rico, she began to work in the public and private school systems of the island. She co-authored a children's book titled El libro Isla para ni√±os (The island book for children) with her husband. Nationalist revolts of the 1950s On May 21, 1948, a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and nationalist movements on the archipelago. The Senate, which at the time was controlled by the Partido Popular Democr√°tico (PPD) and presided by Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, approved the bill.\\"La obra jur√≠dica del Profesor David M. Helfeld (1948‚Äì2008)'; by: Dr. Carmelo Delgado Cintr√≥n This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, became known as the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law, technically \\"Law 53 of 1948\\") when the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero, signed it into law on June 10, 1948. Under this new law it became a crime to print, publish, sell, or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government; or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. It made it illegal to sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the Flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to US$10,000 (), or both. According to Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa, a non-PPD member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, the law was repressive and was in violation of the First Amendment to the US Constitution which guarantees Freedom of Speech. He pointed out that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico.La Gobernaci√≥n de Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero y la Guerra Fr√≠a In 1949, the Nationalist Party held an assembly in the town of Arecibo and named Paoli Secretary General of the party. Some of his duties as Secretary General of the party included the presentation of patriotic speeches. Due to Law 53, these duties placed her husband on a collision course with the U.S. government. In September 1950, her husband traveled to the towns of Cabo Rojo, Santurce, Gu√°nica and Lares, where he participated in Nationalist activities. On October 30, the Nationalists staged uprisings in the towns of Ponce, Mayag√ºez, Naranjito, Arecibo, Utuado (Utuado Uprising), San Juan (San Juan Nationalist revolt), and Jayuya (Jayuya Uprising). On November 2, 1950, the police arrived at their home in R√≠o Piedras and searched for guns and explosives. The only thing they found was a Puerto Rican flag but, due to Law 53 (the Gag Law), this enabled them to arrest and accuse her husband of treason against the United States. The evidence used against him was the Puerto Rican flag in their home, and four speeches he'd made in favor of Puerto Rican independence. On the basis of this \\"evidence\\" her husband was fired from his professorship at the University of Puerto Rico, and sentenced to a twenty-year prison term, which was later reduced to ten years. In jail, her husband shared his cell with Pedro Albizu Campos. Campos suffered from ulcerations on his legs and body caused by radiation, and her husband tended to his needs. Francisco Matos Paoli Her husband wrote patriotic poems on scraps of paper which were smuggled out of the prison by Freire de Matos. She tried to get them published and even though they were inoffensive, the context of the \\"Gag Law\\" and its intended effect, to silence all opposition made the poems take on a different meaning.Revista Hisp√°nica Moderna; Volume 62, Number 1, June 2009; E- Print Her husband was released on probation on January 16, 1952. However, on March 2, 1954, after the Nationalists attack of the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. government ordered the wholesale arrest of Nationalist Party members including her husband, who was not involved in the incident. In 1954, Freire de Matos founded the \\"Escuela Maternal Hostoniana\\" (Maternal Hostonian School) named after Eugenio Mar√≠a de Hostos\\". On May 26, 1955, after ten months in jail and in poor health, her husband was finally pardoned by Puerto Rican Governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n. Author Freire de Matos continued to teach and write. In her college she established a creative experimental method in which she explored the balance between freedom and nature among individuals. She hoped that with her methods her students would develop positive attitudes and love for education. She hoped that her students had would fully develop their talents.

The publication is used in Puerto Rico's elementary schools. On 1971, she also collaborated with the publication of Fe Acosta de Gonz√°lez's \\"Matem√°ticas modernas en el nivel elementa\\" (Modern Math at the elementary level. Francisco Matos Paoli died on July 10, 2000, in their home in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico. Freire de Matos died four years later on September 30, 2004.

Early life The eldest son of Everett L. Hollis, a prominent Chicago attorney, and Marion Armstrong Jennings, a fiction writer, Hollis grew up outside Washington DC and New York City, attended public schools and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history (with honors) from DePauw University (1966) and a master's degree in international affairs from Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (1968). He also studied international law at the City of London College (1965) and the Bologna Center (1967). Career 1970s After a year of teaching in Washington‚Äôs public schools, Hollis joined the International Group of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In a program largely devoted to bilateral councils, as a junior staffer Hollis was assigned to the export expansion and finance desk. He also researched and authored position papers on trade policy subjects for the Chamber‚Äôs International Committee. He soon conceived a bold project aimed at strengthening U.S. export financing programs, organized a special task force of leading bankers and industrialists and recruited a top Caterpillar Tractor Company executive (V.V. Grant) to chair the campaign. Eighteen months later ‚Äì with multiple meetings, two national surveys and a publication he authored,Competitive Export Financing for the 70s, U.S. Chambers of Commerce,1970 Hollis led the Task Force on Export Finance and Credit to testify before Congress and drafted language which formed the core of a successful legislative initiative called the Export Expansion Finance Act of 1971 (H.R. 8181) sponsored by Thomas ‚ÄúLud‚Äù Ashley (D-OH), which broadened the programming flexibility and competitiveness of the Export Import Bank, spearheading a national drive to expand exports. Hollis went on to staff the highly successful U.S.-European Businessmen‚Äôs Conference held in March 1972 (Paris) which brought him into direct interaction with some of the world‚Äôs top industrialists and formed an ongoing US-EC Business Council. Recruited by rival NAM to organize that association‚Äôs international economic affairs department in 1972, Hollis continued his successful innovation with association management by conceiving and implementing the first industry-wide campaign to quantify non-tariff trade barriers (NTB). Working with a coalition of thirty industrial groups representing a broad array of US manufacturing, his surveys, speeches and publications on NTBs led to the formation of a unique industry-sponsored monitoring program for the multilateral trade negotiations (MTN) in 1975 called the Industry Center for Trade Negotiations (ICTN). Hollis rose to become the youngest vice president in NAM‚Äôs history. In early 1973, Hollis authored another study on trade adjustment assistance based on a six months research campaign which drew acclaim.Trade Adjustment Assistance U.S. International Competitiveness and Implications for Domestic Adjustment Policy, National Association of Manufacturers, 1973 A third report and proposed framework for industry-government preparations had a significant influence on the consultative process adapted by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Office of the Special Trade Representative.A Closer Look at Non-Tariff Barriers: A Report from U.S. Industry, National Association of Manufacturers, 1975 A fourth published report also based on a widespread survey of corporate attorneys focused on U.S. anti-trust law as an impediment to U.S. competitiveness was well received.The International Implications of U.S. Anti Trust Law: An Analysis of Global Economic Reality, National Association of Manufacturers, 1975 Hollis also gained prominence during this period by organizing the first large conferences convening U.S. business leaders with Soviet and Arab industrial and agricultural counterparts which later fostered highly successful trade/industrial follow-up missions to the USSR U.S. Soviet Trade Conference Proceeding, National Association of Manufacturers, September 1973, P66-77. See proposal for Council on American-Soviet Trade CAST. and various countries in the North Africa and Persian Gulf region in 1973‚Äì1974, respectively.U.S. Manufacturing Perspective on the Middle East: A Cornerstone for Cooperation, National Association of Manufacturers, 1975 In mid-1975 Hollis relinquished his NAM position to become chief executive of the newly established ICTN with over 150 corporate sponsors and moved to Switzerland to set up its Geneva office near the MTN. By late fall, however, the entire Tokyo Round had ground to a halt as wary Europeans decided to await the results of the U.S. Presidential elections. Hollis returned to Washington, and later resigned this position after arranging for a freelance journalist to forward Geneva reports to ICTN members ‚Äì and began working for Jimmy Carter‚Äôs election campaign. He also established a private consulting business. After Carter‚Äôs election, Hollis supplied ideas on international economic policy and organization to the Carter Transition Team. Later, with congressional support, he received a presidential appointment as Deputy Coordinator for the Office of Reimbursable Development (RDP) in the Office of AID‚Äôs Administrator John J. Gilligan, a former governor (D-OH). RDP was the forerunner of the U.S. Trade and Development Program (TDP) and focused on technical assistance to energy- surplus developing countries which could afford to purchase training and services. Hollis traveled extensively, particularly in OPEC countries, convincing U.S. ambassadors to install RDP attaches and encourage greater use of USG programs from a wide array of federal agencies (not an easy argument for non-aid countries where hostility to AID was clear). In this capacity, Hollis also represented AID at a series of bilateral meetings, most notably in Nigeria, Trinidad/Tobago, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Iran. Hollis‚Äô private meetings with senior government officials in many countries convinced him of the need to formalize trilateral assistance utilizing U.S. expertise and OPEC petrodollars in African agricultural projects, and he pioneered several efforts in Sudan and Somalia after announcing the initiative at a U.S. commercial counselors‚Äô conference in Nairobi in February 1978. In 1980, after leaving AID over political disagreements in the establishment of a trilateral office, Hollis returned to the Middle East organized a high-level series of programs, and provided consulting services across a wide variety of trilateral projects including the Kenana Sugar scheme of R.W. ‚ÄúTiny‚Äù Rowland (Lonrho PLC) in central Sudan, Saudi-Sudanese Red Sea Commission, Egyptian agricultural aviation training, the U.S.-Saudi Business Council and the US-Arab Business Roundtable. While consulting with the Saudi-Sudanese Red Sea Commission, Hollis became acquainted with its chairman, H.E. Dr. Ahmed Zaki Yamani, Saudi Arabia's famous oil minister. 399px Agri-Energy Roundtable These experiences led Hollis to found the Agri-Energy Roundtable (AER), a multilateral dialogue forum convening food and energy-surplus country officials with business leaders in 1980. After AER‚Äôs first conference in New Orleans, a few weeks after the Carter Administration instituted the Soviet grain embargo, Hollis attracted the support of Dr. Armand Hammer, controversial chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Robert O. Anderson, chairman of Atlantic Richfield and Diamond A Cattle Company, and political patronage via the legendary U.S. Senator Jennings Randolph (D-WV), the ‚ÄúLast of the New Dealers‚Äù‚Äîand quickly propelled AER as a formidable international nongovernmental forum with annual conferences in Geneva, Switzerland. Senator Randolph became the de facto chairman and led the U.S. delegations to seven consecutive annual AER conferences (1981‚Äì1987) in Switzerland, often bringing other senators, senior government leaders, and U.S. industrialists‚Äîwhile Hollis gathered international representatives from his global contact network. The forum soon became recognized on the world stage and received United Nations accreditation as an NGO in 1985 by declaration of the UN secretary-general. This recognition came after a highly successful AER mission/conference series in People's Republic of China and PRC participation on the AER board. By 1987, AER had expanded with a growing corporate sponsor base which included some of the world‚Äôs premier companies in agriculture and energy. In addition to its annual meeting and task force programs on renewable energy, non-conventional finance, environment, new agricultural and food technologies, AER began establishing independent counterpart associations via regional conferences (India, Philippines, Uganda, Nigeria, the Gambia, the Persian Gulf and Egypt). Some of these events were coordinated with the U.N. World Food Council ministerial sessions and UNIDO. Around this same time AER formed an alliance with The Agribusiness Council (ABC) ‚Äì an independent U.S. nonprofit association which later became the de facto U.S. chapter of the AER umbrella.Congressional Record. March 7, 1990The Washington Post. Two Agribusiness Groups Team Up to Increase Clout. November 16, 1987 Both AER, and more recently ABC, have received grants from the World Bank, UNIDO and U.S. government agencies to provide training and expand the network of indigenous counterpart associations. In 1995, ABC successfully assisted the establishment of an independent Polish ABC with a Hollis-led ABC team traveling to more than fifteen cities and towns around the country to present seminars and recruit support in less than two months. A similar campaign in Kenya (1998) and Lithuania (2001‚Äì02) showed promising early results, but fell short due to budget cuts. Other programs with adequate support took root in Sri Lanka, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic. During more recent years Hollis has concentrated ABC efforts on building state agribusiness councils, providing information services to subcommittee projects including heritage and historical recognition (e.g., Jennings Randolph Recognition Project, General Longstreet Recognition Project, William Jennings Bryan Recognition Project and others), lecture tours with universities and historical groups, ethanol transparency and international development designed to enhance more balanced trade and food systems development worldwide. Hollis has become a leading adversary of the ADM-led biofuels/ethanol campaign after delivering a speech at a U.S. Department of Justice-sponsored National White Collar Crime Summit in St. Louis (1998).

The American release of the film is narrated by Tim Allen. The film was produced by Disneynature and directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield. It is the sixth nature documentary released under the Disneynature label, following Earth, The Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos, Oceans, Wings of Life, and African Cats. It was released in theaters on April 20, 2012, just before Earth Day, April 22. Plot Oscar is the nickname of a young chimpanzee in his toddler years. He is part of a close-knit tribe of chimpanzees. They occupy a forest territory which is rich in native fruits, nuts, and figs. The chimps hunt small tree monkeys, and they also eat termites collected with primitive tools made from sticks. They also use rocks as tools to crack nuts. Oscar is tended by his mother, nicknamed Isha, and from her he begins learning many things about how to survive in the jungle. In the chaos of an attack by a rival gang of chimpanzees led by 'Scar', Isha is injured and separated from the group and her son. As told by the narrator, Isha most probably falls victim to a nocturnal leopard. Unaware of his mother's death, Oscar spends much of his time looking for her. He has trouble recalling the things she taught him and loses weight quickly. He attempts to find another mother to take care of him. However, none of the females in the group can afford to help him, already having young of their own to raise. As time goes on, Oscar is rejected by every single chimp in the group, until the only one left to approach is the tough-skinned alpha male, nicknamed Freddy. As Oscar follows Freddy and imitates him, it is soon revealed that this unlikely pairing may work out. The two gradually warm up to each other more and more, until one day Freddy lets Oscar ride on his back, something normally only mother chimps do. As the rivals prepare for attack, Freddy is forced to take time away from Oscar to organize the other members of the group, and this leaves the young chimp confused. Scar leads a vicious attack, but because of the unity of Freddy's group, they are driven away into the jungle. A few months later, it is revealed that the bond between Freddy and Oscar has continued to grow, and that life in the group is slowly returning to normal. Production The film took over four years to create, due to the difficulties of filming in Ta√Ø National Park during the wet season and capturing usable footage of common chimpanzees, a species that is known to act reclusive to human activity. Allegedly \\"Oscar\\" was portrayed by several chimpanzees in the movie. Although studies suggest that chimpanzees are capable of committing acts of altruism, Oscar's adoption is the first instance of such an action by the species to be documented on film. Release Chimpanzee had its world premiere at Walt Disney World's Downtown Disney in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. Among the attendees were directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield, producer Don Hahn, and primatologist Jane Goodall. Similar to past Disneynature releases, a portion of the film's opening week proceeds were donated to the Jane Goodall Institute for the \\"See Chimpanzee, Save Chimpanzees\\" program to help protect chimpanzees and their habitats. Disney donated $0.20 of every ticket sold, with $100,000 being the bare minimum. After the film's successful debut, Disney extended the campaign into the second weekend. The film was released in the UK on 3 May 2013. Single The McClain Sisters wrote and performed the song \\"Rise\\" to be featured as the end credits song for Chimpanzee. The song was released on iTunes on March 23, 2012 and peaked at #4 on Billboard's Kid Digital Songs charts. Its release was in support of Disney's Friends for Change. Critical reception Chimpanzee was met with generally positive critical reception; based on 93 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film currently holds a 74% \\"Certified Fresh\\" approval rating from critics, with an average score of 6.4/10 and the consensus: \\"Chimpanzee often anthropomorphizes its subjects, but it's a beautifully filmed, remarkably intimate look at the lives of a family of primates.\\" CinemaScore audiences gave the film a grade \\"A\\" rating on an A+ to F scale.

Its rulers were the Shatuo warlords Li Keyong and Li Cunxu (Li Keyong's son). Although the Five Dynasties period began only in 907, Li Keyong's territory which centered around modern Shanxi can be referred to as Jin as early as 896, when he was officially created the Prince of Jin by the failing and powerless Tang dynasty court, or even (by extension, anachronistically) as early as 883, when he was created the jiedushi of Hedong Circuit, which controlled more or less the same territory. History The Jin rulers Li Keyong and Li Keyong's son Li Cunxu, of Shatuo extraction, claimed to be the rightful subjects of the defunct Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907), in a struggle against the usurper state of the Later Liang Dynasty. At the time of the Tang Dynasty's fall in 907, the Jin state consisted of most, but not all, of modern Shanxi, and eventually expanded to cover all of the territory north of the Yellow River. Eventually, in 923, Li Cunxu, claiming rightful succession to the Tang throne, declared himself emperor, transitioning his state to the Later Tang Dynasty, which shortly after destroyed the Later Liang Dynasty. * Former countries in Chinese history 10th-century establishments in China 907 establishments 923 disestablishments 10th-century disestablishments in China States and territories established in the 900s States and territories disestablished in the 920s History of Shanxi ","title":"Jin (Later Tang precursor)"},{"id":"34083801","text":"Nantong Museum () is located in Nantong, Jiangsu Province, China, at 19 Qixiu Road in Chongchuan District.

By 1922, they had organized themselves into a military group and began killing informers, government officials, and ex-officials. They also published an illegal newspaper describing British exploitation of India. It was declared an unlawful association by the British in April 1923. They used religious imagery and discussed the loss of Sikh sovereignty in the Anglo-Sikh wars which helped them enjoy popular support. The Babbar Akali movement recruited from World War I veterans dissatisfied with broken land grant promises and former members of the Ghadar Party.

The name reflected a focus on tailored casual wear, predominantly jodhpurs, slacks, pleated skirts and shirts. Innovative marketing under the leadership of Morris Bardas resonated with women in post- war Australia and became a respected and iconic brand. After his death in 1959, his vision was continued by his son David Bardas who succeeded him at the head of the company. Over the following decades the business continued to flourish and grow, expanding into youth-oriented fashion in the 1960s and menswear in the 1970s. By the 1990s the company had grown into a fashion empire that was producing a multimillion-dollar turnover from 200 stores and nineteen women and men's fashion labels. In 1994, David Bardas, lost control of the group when the banks moved to secure the assets that underpinned their outstanding loans. Prime among these was the expensive Sportsgirl Centre in Collins Street, which had put the group under intense financial strain. As a result, a South African company, Truworths, was able to buy 90 per cent of the group. However, by 1999 declining sales and growing losses resulted in Truworths ceasing funding of the business. The company was put into voluntary administration in November that year. The core retail brands, Sportscraft, Sportsgirl and David Lawrence were sold individually in 2000 to respectively, Apparel Group, Sussan Corporation and Webster Holdings.

The Copyright Alliance's institutional members include over fifty trade organizations, associations, unions, companies, and guilds, that represent millions of individual creators. The Copyright Alliance also directly collaborates with and represents thousands of creative individuals and small businesses. The creative industries represented include writers, composers, recording artists, journalists, documentarians, filmmakers, graphic artists, visual artists, photographers, and software developers. History At its launch in May 2007, the Copyright Alliance was founded by four Board members, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, Broadcast Music, Inc., the Motion Picture Association of America and Universal. It was initially created and masterminded by President and CEO of the MPAA Jack Valenti. Music artists Steve Cropper and Lamont Dozier attended the launch, which included a membership of 29 organizations purporting to represent 11 million workers, including the Association of American Publishers, Microsoft, the Recording Industry Association of America, Viacom and Walt Disney. (also available from ) The launch of the Copyright Alliance was supported by U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers (D-MI), ranking Representative Howard Coble (R-NC), and Representative Howard Berman (D-CA), members of the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet. Berman, speaking of his inspiration by the late Jack Valenti, spoke of \\"the constant assaults on copyright law\\" and called the group's launch \\"a tremendous idea\\". Coble said that \\"Digitization and related technologies beg some changes to the copyright laws, and I wish you the best of luck and my support as you roll out the Copyright Alliance\\". The Copyright Alliance was launched in opposition to the Digital Freedom Campaign, formed the preceding October, whose members include the Consumer Electronics Association, Public Knowledge, and the Electronic Freedom Foundation. Patrick Ross served as executive director for four years until succeeded by Sandra Aistars on December 20, 2010. Prior to taking the position Aistars was Vice President and Associate General Counsel at Time Warner. On September 15, 2015, it was announced that Keith Kupferschmid would succeed Sandra Aistars as CEO of the Copyright Alliance. Kupferschmid previously served as General Counsel and Senior Vice President for Intellectual Property at the Software and Information Industry Association (SIIA).

Over the years, the Copyright Alliance has collaborated with various groups. In 2014, it helped the US Copyright Office present its 2014 World IP Day program That same year, it also hosted a briefing on Capitol Hill with the Creative Rights Caucus to \\"discuss the challenges photographers and visual artists face in the internet age.\\" The organization also has worked with groups such as Google, Yahoo, and Public Knowledge to develop voluntary best practices for addressing online copyright infringement. Advocacy The Copyright Alliance filed briefs in Allen v. Cooper, which was decided in 2020: the Supreme Court of the United States abrogated the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act as unconstitutional, the Copyright Alliance had argued the opposite view. Political issues The group supported an IP-PRO bill establishing a \\"copyright czar\\" in June 2008 Senate Judiciary Committee hearings. The PRO-IP bill was introduced in the Senate shortly thereafter and passed into law. Ars Technica called the bill a victory for \\"Big Content\\", though a provision for the Department of Justice to join suits for the benefit of copyright holders was stripped from the bill. On November 16, 2009, the Copyright Alliance was joined by some of its grassroots members in hand-delivering a letter to the White House signed by more than 11,000 artists and creators, calling on President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden to defend the rights of artists and creators. In May 2009, it launched the Creators Across America campaign, which includes videos of artists and creators across the United States speaking about their arts and their rights under copyright law. The Copyright Alliance received $600,000 from the MPAA in 2012, which that year had also donated $475,000 to the Center for Copyright Information and $100,000 each to the Democratic Governors Association and Republican Governors Association as part of an anti-piracy campaign. The Copyright Alliance also supports the Music Modernization Act (MMA), which was entered into law in 2018; and the Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement Act of 2019 (the CASE Act).

On the Boomahnoomoonah Road, approximately 12 km southeast of Yarrawonga it was once a small town having its own school, church and post office. Comprising medium to large farms the area is predominantly agricultural, focusing on dairying as well as sheep and cattle grazing. Some viticulture is also practised. Boomahnoomoonah is the longest single-word place name in Victoria. Early history The Victorian Aborigines are the traditional owners of the land; in particular the Bangerang people, a family group of the Yorta Yorta people who occupied a large area along the Murray river. A former postmistress claimed that the towns name was \\"aboriginal for 'big water'\\".Boomahnoomoonah And Upotipotpon Stay Unchanged. (25 May 1936).

The early exploration of the area was conducted by Hamilton Hume and William Hovell during the first half of the 19th century. Squatters soon moved into the area and vast stations for grazing sheep and cattle were quickly established. During the 1860s the Victorian Land Acts allowed for the subdivision of large holdings and a provision for Selectors to take up small allotments at minimal cost. This saw an increase in the population of the area. The names of some early Selectors include Edward Lewis who took up 272 acres, Daniel Doherty who occupied 191 acres and the Woods family who selected over 500 acres. In March 1881 a post office was opened to service local residents but closed in February 1939. Around the same time the Boomahnoomoonah State School accepted its first students and operated at various times up until the 1950s when it closed permanently.Opinion. Border Mail. 26 February 2009. St Oswald's Church of England began services in May 1890 and continued to serve the community until its closure in 2012 due to poor numbers (a congregation of 6-7) and the dilapidated state of the church itself.The Advocate.

Later history During the early 1900s the provision of irrigation was improved which in turn encouraged the growth of local dairy farms. At this time the town had its own cricket club and was relatively competitive in the local district. The area continued to grow up until the mid 1960s when advances in agricultural methods reduced the need for manual workers and the area gradually reverted to larger holdings. Lack of employment opportunities and an aging local population saw many, if not all, local amenities removed in deference to the larger district towns.Small towns and settlements of the Moira Shire: Draft context report.

BayFiles works by letting users upload files to its servers and share them online. Users are provided with a link to access their files, which can be shared with anyone on the internet so that they can download the files associated with the particular link. A unique aspect of this file hosting service is that it does not provide a search function for its users or any sort of file directory that could be used to navigate its online file base. BayFiles can be used and accessed by people without requiring them to sign up for it.  Legal issues  One of the critical features of the BayFiles hosting service is that its founders have chosen to disallow the uploads of any content that violates third party copyright laws. This has come as a surprise to many people who are familiar with the founder's previous website The Pirate Bay, which was surrounded by legal controversy concerning copyright issues. In the website's terms of service, it asserts that it will disable the accounts of those users who frequently violate its copyright terms. BayFiles co-founder Fredrik Neij has even claimed to have hired DMCA agents who will help ensure that BayFiles is properly complying with current United States copyright law. Despite BayFiles' goal of complying with U.S. digital copyright law, some have speculated that it will still potentially face major lawsuits because of the legal history its founders and their The Pirate Bay have had with record labels and movie studios in the past. But as long as BayFiles never explicitly promotes copyright infringement, it can maintain the legal status of its operation through relying on the precedent established in a 2010 court case won by RapidShare. Bayfiles was shut down in November 2014. The reasons for the site's sudden disappearance are unknown, though some have indicated it was likely linked to the arrest of its sole registrant and former Pirate Bay operator Fredrik Neij.

The system closed in 2013, but reopened in 2016 with one route and a fleet of around 30 modernised ≈†koda 15Tr.Trolleybus Magazine No. 328 (July‚ÄìAugust 2016), pp. 118‚Äì119. National Trolleybus Association (UK). History The system commenced operations on , on a route about in length, between Meydan-e-Emam- Hoseyn (Imam Hossein Square) and Terminal-e-Sharq, running along Damavand Khiyaban (Damavand Street). A fleet of 35 ≈†koda 15Tr articulated trolleybuses opened the system, and 30 more of the same type arrived in 1992 to expand the fleet to 65 vehicles. The still-new system then grew with the opening of several more routes and extensions. Visitors in 2014 found that the system had ceased operation, and by October at least, all of the wiring had been taken down. It was subsequently determined that the closure had apparently taken place sometime in 2013, but the exact date remains unknown. Around 10 trolleybuses were still being stored at the southern depot in October 2014. Although it was reported after the closure that a return of electric buses was planned, there was no indication, at that time, of whether these would be trolleybuses or some other type of electric bus. In 2016, a visitor to the city in May discovered that the system had reopened, and was told that this had occurred on, or shortly after, 21 March 2016. Although around 30 vehicles are reported to have been refurbished for the reopening of the system, only three were observed in service in May 2016, running on a 1.8-km route.  Lines  In the 2000s As of 2005, trolleybuses were operating on five routes, all starting at Meydan-e-Emam-Hoseyn (Imam Hossein Square),Trolleybus Magazine No. 265 (January‚ÄìFebruary 2006), pp. 16‚Äì17. National Trolleybus Association (UK). near Imam Hossein station of the Tehran Metro Line 2. The total route length, not counting shared sections, was . = Northeastern lines = The two routes running northeastwards, lines 1 and 2, operated almost entirely in a segregated busway located in the middle of the wide carriageway (along Damavand Khiyaban), stopping only at purpose-built stops located about every 500 metres, effectively making these routes trolleybus-BRT (but they were not called such). Line 1 was the primary northeastern route, and was long. Line 2 was an express line following the same route, but serving fewer stops. Both lines terminated at Terminal-e-Sharq. Sometime between 2005 and autumn 2010, both of these routes were closed, and their wiring was taken down. = Southern lines = The other three trolleybus routes, lines 3, 4 and 5, ran south from Meydan-e-Emam-Hoseyn along Hefdah-e-Shahrivar (Shahrivar Street) and operated in mixed-traffic. Both route sections were served both by limited-stop services and local (making all stops) services. Line 3 terminated at Meydan-e-Chorasan, and line 4 continued farther south, to Bozorgrah-e- Be'sat. Line 5 branched off Hefdah-e-Shahrivar along Khiaban-e Shush (Shush Street), and terminated initially at Meydan-e-Shush (Shush Square), which is the location of Shush Metro Station on metro line 1. A extension of line 5 from Meydan-e-Shush to Meydan-e-Rah Ahan (Rah Ahan Square) and the railway station there opened in March 2010.Trolleybus Magazine No. 298 (July‚ÄìAugust 2011), pp. 89‚Äì90. National Trolleybus Association (UK). However, at an unknown date thereafter, Meydan-e-Emam-Hoseyn (Imam Hossein Square) was converted into a pedestrian zone, and the trolleybus service was cut back by about 1 km to Meydan-e-Shohada. This deprived the trolleybus system of its main role as a fast surface connection to the metro station at Meydan-e-Emam-Hoseyn, causing a decline in ridership that is believed to have been a factor in the c. 2013 closure decision. In 2016 The system reopened on, or shortly after, 21 March 2016. In May 2016, the only service observed in operation was a 1.8-km route between Meydan-e-Khorasan (Khorasan Square) and Bozorgrah-e-Be'sat. Extensions are planned.  Fleet  ≈†koda 15Tr in Rah Ahan Square (2011). The backbone of the Tehran trolleybus fleet has been 65 ≈†koda 15Tr articulated buses, of which around 30 are believed to be serviceable in 2016. The ≈†kodas were built in the then Czechoslovakia in 1991 (fleet numbers 794‚Äì828) and 1992 (fleet numbers 921‚Äì950). Around 2006, a two-axle prototype vehicle was built; it was based on a Volvo B10M. At an unknown date after the 2013 suspension, refurbishment of some of the 15Tr trolleybuses began, with around 30 being refurbished by 2016, when the system reopened. The work included modernisation of their front and rear ends and the replacement of the side windows with bonded, tinted ones. They had also been repainted in a new livery of overall white, except black around the windows, with a \\"yellow flash\\" along the side and blue shading on some portions. Depots Before the 2013 suspension, Tehran's trolleybuses were based at two depots; the two groups of vehicles could be distinguished by their liveries. The trolleybuses used on lines 1 and 2 wore a green-yellow-white livery (the system's original livery) and were based at the northeastern depot, at Terminal-e-Sharq. These were the 1992 vehicles, carrying fleet numbers mostly in the 900 series. Those operating lines 3, 4 and 5 were liveried blue and white (in some cases with yellow highlights) and were based at the southern depot, near Bozorgrah-e-Be'sat. They carried 800-series fleet numbers (the 1991 vehicles). In the 2016-reopened system, only the southern depot, near Bozorgrah-e-Be'sat, is in use.

Kim Hong-il of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office cleared Lee of any wrongdoing, based on Lee's denial that he had ever been associated with BBK. That would soon prove to be untrue, as it soon came to light that Lee, in public speeches by him, had publicly admitted that he was the owner of BBK: Three days before the election, an October 2000 video surfaced of Lee delivering a speech to an audience of students at Kwangwoon University, in which he can be seen \\"bragging\\" that he had founded and directed BBK activities (\\"BBK? Yup, that's mine!\\"). Two days before the election, the National Assembly appointed a prosecutor and charged him with the task of investigating the matter. Chung Ho-young, as Special Prosecutor in charge of the investigation would soon declare Lee to be innocent of the accusations relating to the alleged fraud and the so-called BBK incident. Critics pointed out that the investigation appeared to have been compromised and that the prosecution may have felt intimidated, seeing as how it chose not to delve any further, likely figuring that Lee would be elected president. Even the fact that Lee was interviewed, rather than interrogated, is identical to the way Clinton was given kid glove treatment. That the particular type of establishment where the Lee interview took place was once known as a kisaeng house did not go well with the public once the news broke, as a kisaeng house refers to a high-end, brothel-like-restaurant establishment where female attendants/entertainers cater to men of power and wealth. In response to public outcry, the special prosecutor's office announced that the initial interview location had been leaked to the media, so was changed at the last minute to a new location‚Äîthe former kisaeng house, nestled in a secluded, remote location, away from the city, safe from prying eyes. They also declared that they had gone in fully prepared and had more than sufficient time to conduct the interview. According to WikiLeaks, Yoo Chong-ha (Ïú†Ï¢ÖÌïò), the former co-chairman of Lee Myung-bak's presidential election campaign, had requested of Alexander Vershbow, the then American ambassador to South Korea, that the US authorities help delay the extradition to Korea asnaoight by the Korean government, in order that presidential hopeful Lee Myung-bak's election campaign might better control and effectively contain the controversy relating to Lee's alleged involvement in the BBK embezzlement scandal, there on the eve of the election season. 2012 Shin Myung, the alleged writer of the fake letter, returned to South Korea from the US and turned himself in to the SPO on April 4, 2012. DAS DAS is a South Korean company involved in the BBK scandal. When allegations of fraud arose as part of the BBK matter, it was originally purported in late December 2011 that the owners of DAS were members of Lee Myung-bak's family, e.g., Lee Sang-Eun (Ïù¥ÏÉÅÏùÄ), one of Lee's older brothers, but not Lee himself. The Korean prosecutors at the time announced that Lee did not appear to be the owner of DAS, a position from which they now appear to be backtracking based on mounds of fresh evidence. As of early March 2018,for instance, it has been alleged that Lee Myung-Bak is, and always has been, the true owner of DAS, which the Korean government itself owns a portion of, received as payment of inheritance taxes owed by Lee's family. To that end, the Korean prosecution has obtained testimony not only from Kim Baek- Joon, Lee Myung-Bak's decades-long confidant, private secretary, de facto butler and putative errand boy now turning state's evidence, but also from Lee Sang-Deuk, another older brother of Lee's who on Friday, 2 March 2018 testified that the seed money that went into the founding of DAS in the guise of proceeds from the sale of property in Seoul's posh Dogok-dong district, was not his own, but in fact that of his brother Lee Myung-Bak's, with the younger Lee being the actual owner of the Dogok-dong property. The legal implications concerning Lee Myung-Bak's alleged ownership of DAS is far-reaching and has thrown the whole of South Korea into turmoil. For irrespective of the corporate ownership structure of DAS on paper, Lee Myung-Bak would be the true beneficial owner of DAS, making the question of DAS' legal ownership less important than the fact that DAS, for all intents and purposes, has been and is the \\"alter ego\\" of Lee Myung-Bak's throughout all relevant periods, especially for the purposes of funneling overseas bribes. This further implicates the FCPA (\\"Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977\\") which allows the U.S. courts to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction if the proscribed act involves US persons natural or juridical. The latest details of allegations involving BBK, DAS, and Lee implicate Samsung's having bankrolled DAS' legal fees by remitting millions of dollars as payment in DAS' behalf to Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer, and Feld, a prominent U.S. law firm representing DAS in a lawsuit brought againat it by Optional Ventures as plaintiff for alleged theft and conversion of funds belonging to Optional Ventures which Kim had embezzled as part of the BBK scandal. Samsung, as widely reported in the Korean press, is alleged to have funneled a substantial amount of money to Lee through said U.S. law firm, Akin Gump, with the aid and involvement of one or more of its overseas U.S. subsidiaries. Under U.S. law, that would constitute a bribery of a foreign official by U.S. persons, natural or juridical, if true. Lee Myung- Bak at the time was not merely a foreign official, but the sitting president of South Korea at the time: Samsung's alleged payment of DAS' legal fees to, and through, Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer, and Feld means that everyone is on the hook, ranging from Lee Myung-Bak himself as the recipient of said bribes; to Akin, Gump, for functioning as the conduit as part, and in furtherance, of the conspiracy to violate the FCPA and the attendant conspiracy to violate United States law, which is a separate crime in and of itself; to Samsung and its subsidiaries through which the alleged payments were channeled; to even Lee Kun-Hee, Samsung's purportedly ailing chairman, for his alleged role in giving the greenlight on the paying of bribes (allegedly at least some of it) to Lee in the form of DAS' legal fees; to Korean-American attorney Suk Han Kim, then a partner with Akin, Gump and now with a different firm, for allegedly setting up the whole deal on behalf of Samsung and for the benefit of Lee Myung-Bak. Such FCPA woes are compounded by Samsung's alleged amounts paid to and through Akin, Gump in excess of the legal fees owed by DAS, suggesting there are likely additional U.S. law violations, e.g., money laundering and wire fraud, which are violations under the Stamp Act as provided in the United States Code. While the investigation by the Korean prosecutors into Lee's ownership of DAS and Samsung's alleged overseas bribery is still on-going, and though the focus by the local Korean prosecutors is on domestic Korean aspects only, it may be that there is now sufficient probable cause to warrant a grand jury hearing and an indictment to trigger a massive FCPA investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice. Reaction from the US Federal Court The Korean language Korean-American newspaper, Sunday Journal, published an article on December 1, 2011, that the U.S. Federal District Court in Los Angeles rescinded the confiscation order entered against DAS on November 17, 2011. Controversy The Supreme Court of South Korea officially decided to indict one of the hosts of Naneun Ggomsuda, Chung Bong-ju, for false reporting of the BBK-related information.

His academic career was mainly at Bologna. He was an influential jurisconsult and teacher in Florence from the 1390s. He spent time also at Siena and Venice. In 1402 he moved to the University of Ferrara, with Antonius de Butrio (who was one of his students) and Johannes de Imola. An elaborator of conciliarism, he participated in the Council of Pisa and Council of Constance on behalf of Antipope John XXIII.R. N. Swanson, Universities, Academics and the Great Schism (2002), p. 209‚Äì10; Google Books.  Views  Peter of Ancarano's commentary on the Decretals of Gregory IX was celebrated. P√©ter Erd≈ë, Storia della scienza del diritto canonico: una introduzione (1999), p. 114; Google Books. On his Tractatus de schismate (written 1405, unpublished but widely circulated as manuscript), his views were fundamentally in favour of papal monarchy; but in terms of the Western Schism as it stood after 1400, the behaviour of both Antipope Benedict XIII and Pope Gregory XII made him shift ground towards a conciliar resolution.Joseph Canning, A History of Medieval Political Thought: 300-1450 (2006), pp. 178‚Äì9; Google Books. Baldassarre Cossa (shortly to be an antipope as John XXIII) persuaded him, perhaps with Butrio, to write in 1405 on the schism.Brian Tierney (editor), Authority and Power: studies on medieval law and government presented to Walter Ullmann on his seventieth birthday (1980), p. 227; Google Books. In line with the Bologna faculty generally, and Francesco Zabarella, he believed Pope Gregory, in particular, should keep to commitments he had made.Philippe Levillain, The Papacy: Gaius-Proxies (2002), p. 635; Google Books. The marriage of Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence and Margaret Holland in 1412 required a papal dispensation, because of the degree of consanguinity as defined in canon law and the Book of Leviticus. The dispensation was granted by John XXIII, against quite recent precedent (the 1392 case of Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac who wished to marry the widow of his late brother John III, Count of Armagnac, and was refused by Pope Clement VII); and proceeded on the basis of an opinion of Peter of Ancarano (influenced by Andrea).

This is where the main plot of the series is set. However, the adventures are not limited to this village. Some of the main characters often travel via the \\"Doors of Time\\". The village is isolated from the rest of the world and it is not shown on maps. The Imaginary Travelers continually try to protect the \\"Doors of Time\\". Doors of Time The story of the first seven books focuses on the Doors of Time and their keys. There are several Doors of Time spread around the village, and each door requires its own unique key to open it. Once opened, it leads to a distant time and space specific to that door and it can only be reopened when all of the travelers who passed through it return. The only exception is the Door of Time inside the Argo Mansion, which can take the traveler to any place he or she wants, as opposed to the fixed locations the other Doors offer. However, four keys are needed to open that one, making it the most difficult door to access. This particular door leads to a cave where there is a lake and a boat called \\"Metis\\" used to take the Travelers to their destinations. Characters * Jason and Julia Covenant live at the Argo Mansion, but are from London.They are twins and are eleven years old in the first book and turn thirteen in the seventh book. Julia is a little taller than Jason. Both are blond and have blue eyes. In the sixth book, Julia starts dating Rick Banner and in the eighth book Anita Bloom becomes Jason's girlfriend. * Rick Banner is one year older than the twins and has always lived in Kilmore Cove. He is a redhead and his father died when he was young. In the sixth book, it is revealed that his father died because he was searching with Leonard Minaxo for the First Key. * Ulysses Moore was married to Penelope Moore and they were the owners of the Argo Mansion. Nestor, the butler of the Argo Mansion, is actually Ulysses Moore, who uses this disguise because the village people bothered him. After the death of his wife, however, Ulysses stayed on as butler at the Argo Mansion * Penelope Moore was Ulysses' wife. They met on a trip to Venice, and fell in love. * Leonard Minaxo is the lighthouse keeper of the village and was a member of The Imaginary Travelers club, as were Ulysses and Penelope Moore. Towards the end of the sixth book it is revealed that Leonard had a secret passion for Calypso, the librarian. * Anita Bloom enters the story in the seventh book. She lives in Venice, Italy, with her mother while her father lives in England. She finds a book from a painter who also belonged to The Imaginary Travelers club and with the help of Ulysses Moore's diaries she goes to Kilmore Cove to find the Covenant twins. * Nestor is the caretaker of Argo Manor *Oblivia Newton is a millionaire, who wants to control all the doors and is the villain in the 1-6 books Adaptation In 2010 it was announced that a movie short was being filmed in Liverpool to gather interest for a potential film adaptation of Ulysses Moore, in the production of which it has been reported that Disney may be involved.

Nagi Reddy, M. G. Ramachandran was considering an entry into politics, so he told Reddy that he wanted to make a film to gauge audience response to seeing him as a politician. Nagi Reddy suggested remaking the Telugu film Kathanayakudu; Ramachandran agreed and remade the film as Nam Naadu. Unlike the Telugu original, Nam Naadu was made with many politically-charged dialogues because, according to film historian Prakash Raman, \\"that was the time when MGR was about to launch his party\\".  Release & reception  Nagi Reddy recalled watching the film with Ramachandran: \\"When it was released, we both went to Mekala Theatre to watch the reaction of the viewers. Except for the manager, no one was aware of our presence. It was a pleasant evening and the doors had been kept wide open. MGR stood leaning on one side of the door and I was leaning on the other. There was a scene in which Jayalalitha, the heroine of the movie, appeared singing the song Vaangaiya Vaathiyaraiah while welcoming MGR after his victory in the elections.\\" Reddy went on to say \\"The audience rose as one man, cheering, clapping, whistling. There were cries: ‚ÄòWe want to see the scene again! Repeat the scene!‚Äô We advised the manager to oblige the audience. The reel was rewound and the sequence was shown again. I turned to MGR. His eyes were filled with tears of joy. He hugged me. ‚ÄòO Reddiar! I have received the people‚Äôs acceptance.‚Äô The Indian Express wrote, \\"That contemporary politics can be made into a successful film is proved by Vijaya International's Nam Nadu\\". The reviewer went on to say, \\"Colour is pleasing. The editing is component. Music by M. S. Viswanathan fails. The film is too long.\\"  Soundtrack  Music is composed by M. S. Viswanathan.

His early football was played at the nearby village of Rhostyllen before joining Wrexham Olympic for a year in 1885.

The kick-off was delayed while a replacement was sought; eventually the match got underway with Pugh in goal, before Gillam arrived some twenty minutes into the match. Neither 'keeper conceded a goal and the match ended 0‚Äì0; this was the first time in 14 matches between the countries that the Scots had failed to defeat the Welsh, and only the second international match in which neither team had managed to score, the first being the very first officially recognised international match, between Scotland and England on 30 November 1872.At this time, the only countries involved in international football were the British \\"home\\" nations; i.e. England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

Publications and Brief Summaries Kallzache Kholayek Thaun is a novel by Epifanio Valadares,a Gulf-based engineer, who took to writing because he had a lot of free time or leisure. Punching the keys on his laptop, Epifanio Valadares says that slowly the pages accumulated into a full- fledged novel. Kallzache Kholayek Thaun is conceived as a tale of a boy from humble origins who goes on to do many great things ‚Äì some nothing short of a miracle. Kudov, the protagonist, is a person whose innovations and inventions take him across the Indian sub-continent as a fugitive on the run from the arms of law. Kudov is the pet name of the protagonist given by his villagers ‚Äì as it happens in many Goan villages ‚Äì after a bird which never stays in one place. Kudov has the immense ability to acquire knowledge and use it to invent technology that could possibly change the face of the world. He invents a cure for a very deadly disease that is poised to wipe out the whole population of his village. Next, he invents a thermo-dynamic engine which can run on water. When he elopes with his lover ‚Äì who later becomes his wife ‚Äì to Bombay and reaches the Taj hotel, it is that fateful day when this hotel is attacked by terrorists. Kudov and his wife were on a run from the police (and also on their honeymoon) and in the crossfire of the security forces and the terrorists, Anushka, his wife meets an untimely death. This moves Kudov to invent a device that would detect the locations of explosives that could potentially pose a threat to national security. Kudov anonymously tips-off the police about the whereabouts of terrorists. Since Kudov is unwilling to share the secrets of his innovations and because such innovations can be deadly in wrong hands, the security forces are constantly on the lookout for him. As a result, Kudov is on the run again and he lands up in Nepal. It is here in Nepal that he finally gets arrested and is brought down to Goa. Sopon by James Fernandes is a collection of ten one-act plays. The author is a high-school teacher by profession. Budd‚Äôtti or flood by Manuel Fernandes is a novel which takes its inspiration from the Biblical tale of Noah and the deluge that God had sent on the earth. Manuel Fernandes has tried to use the symbolism of the Flood and how it inundates everything, in trying to comment about the abysmal and egregious conditions of Goan political life and also (one suspects) the declining moral values of Catholic families. The novel opens with Ronald, a small-time cloth merchant and his wife Ravina who are very devoted to each other. But there is a sudden twist in the story: Ronald starts having an affair with a young widow, Sofia. Ravina is divorced by Ronald and he drives her out of the house ‚Äì and into destitution. In another turn of events, Ronald is shown as leading an agitation against a pollution-causing factory. This agitation snowballs into a popular movement which propels him into politics. In due course of time he also becomes the Chief Minister of Goa. Agitation against big industries is an important theme in the book and I believe it is included in the narrative because in recent times Goa has gone through many such agitations. Ravina is shown as migrating to Bombay, only to make a dramatic and somewhat surreal entry in the end. Meanwhile, due to his power and influence Ronald starts indulging himself in corrupt practices. He starts smuggling arms and precious metals as well as making under-the-table deals to set up pollution-causing industries. Ronald chances upon a hidden vault when constructing his house and he converts it into a cave; a haven for his contraband. This hidden cave is accidentally discovered by Felicio, a journalist who puts his principles and the ethics of the profession first and follows them to the book. After a lot of rather bizarre twists and turns, Ronald receives punishment for his evil deeds. His criminal activities are exposed (though in a way that would never stand a chance in a court of law!) and he has to run away from the long arm of the law as well as the frenzied fury of his voters. Ronald escapes to the surrounding jungle and returns in a state of destitution and injury to a dilapidated house, where he breathes his last. During his funeral, suddenly, the sky becomes overcast and there is a torrent of rain. And since the novel is set on the banks of the Zuari (Cortalim to be precise), the banks of the river overflow and the resulting flood washes the coffin and with it the corpse of Ronald into the sea.

It is assumed that auditory feedback, alongside other feedback mechanisms such as somatosensory feedback and visual feedback, helps to verify whether the current production of a passage of speech or singing is in accord with a person's acoustic-auditory intention. From the viewpoint of movement sciences and neurosciences the acoustic-auditory speech signal can be interpreted as the result of movements (skilled actions) of speech articulators (the lower jaw, lips, tongue, etc.), and thus auditory feedback can be interpreted as a feedback mechanism controlling skilled actions in the same way that visual feedback controls limb movements (e.g. reaching movements).  Speech  Auditory feedback is an important aid during speech acquisition by toddlers, who use it to control the learning of speech items. These are typically produced by a communication partner (e.g. caretaker) and heard by the toddler, who subsequently tries to imitate them. After speech acquisition (i.e. in the case of adults), it is assumed that auditory feedback is not used as intensively. This is also assumed to happen for other feedback mechanisms, such as somatosensory feedback in the case of speech. However, the well-known delayed auditory feedback experiment indicated that auditory feedback becomes important during speech production even for adults, if the auditory perception pathway is altered.. See also and alterations by permanent shift of a formant, . A further well-known effect, which underlines the importance of auditory feedback throughout a person's lifetime, is that the production of sounds such as sibilant fricatives (like /s/) begins to deteriorate in deafened adults. Because auditory feedback needs more than 100 milliseconds before a correction occurs at the production level,See e.g. it is a slow correction mechanism in comparison with the duration (or production time) of speech sounds (vowels or consonants). Thus auditory feedback is too slow to correct the production of a speech sound in real time. It has been shown, however, that auditory feedback is capable of changing speech-sound production over a series of trials (i.e. adaptation by relearning; see e.g. perturbation experiments done with the DIVA model: neurocomputational speech processing). 10 minutes is typically sufficient for a nearly-full adaptation.  Singing  The importance of auditory feedback in the case of human singing is reviewed by Howell.  Bird songs  The role of auditory feedback in the learning and production of bird-song is reviewed by Brainard and Doupe.  Product  A new headphone called Forbrain is based on auditory feedback principles. It uses a bone conductor and a series of dynamic filters to correct the perception of one's own voice, thus helps improving concentration, attention, speech, coordination, and other sensory functions.

These seven female characters, which the poet picked from history to convey his poetic message, have remained cultural icons in the history of Sindh for their bravery, passion, loyalty, commitment, and character strength. Marui's character portrays the love for the land, its people, her commitment with her traditions, her stance before a tyrant king, Umar (ÿπŸÖÿ±) or as some say (Amar‚ÄîÿßŸÖÿ±).Umar Marvi Moomal's character portrays an image of a passionate soul, brimming with love for her beloved, Rano (ÿ±ÿß⁄ªŸà) and suffers at the altar of separation and rejection but does not surrender.Momal Rano Sadia was a very loving soul who met with Sarmad(ÿ≥ÿ±ŸÖÿØ) only once she was very loyal to him they even didn't talk but their feeling of love and respect is countless and their silent love journey started eternally. Sadia-Sarmad's story was not famous as others but in some old books their story of love was written Sadia belongs to the Baluchi tribe and Sarmad was Punjabi Rajput they face the separation due to Norms and Culture. An accidentally he killed two men out of three and the third one killed him he was saving unknown Lady who was shouting nearby the farms for help Sarmad was a kind man. Sadia Sarmad Sasui is a daunting lady, who takes a debilitating journey of mountainous tracks to find her beloved, Punhoon (ŸæŸÜŸáŸàŸÜ).Sassui Punhun Noori is a fisher-woman who enchants the king Tamachi (ÿ™ŸÖÿß⁄ÜŸä) and turns out to be one of the most romantic characters in Sindhi literatureNoori Jam Tamachi like Moomal and Suhni. Sohni is a daring soul, who, in order to meet her beloved Mehar (ŸÖŸäŸáÿßÿ±) overlooks the hyper waves of the Indus River and keeps meeting her beloved on the far bank of the river and one night falls victim to the river waves and dies.Sohni Mehar Lilan loses her king (husband) Chanesar for an obscenely expensive necklace and undergoes travails of an unbearable separation to regain her status and character;Lilan Chanesar while Sorath is a loving soul, full of passion and care about her beloved.Sorath Rai Diyach Shah Abdul Latif had structured his poetry book, Ganj,Shah Jo Risalo commonly known as Shah Jo Risalo, in a form that suggested he intended to convey his message to the world through his verse. Among many of intentions behind his poetry, one of his major inclinations was towards highlighting the marginalized populace of the country, especially women. Accordingly, he chose these Seven women or () or Seven Queens of the Sindhi folktales as protagonists in his stories. These tragic romantic tales are Umar Marvi,Sadia Sarmad,Momal Rano, Sohni Mehar, Lilan Chanesar, Noori Jam Tamachi,Sassui Punhun and Sorath Rai Diyach. These heroic women have a considerable influence on all the literature written in Pakistan (Sindhi, Urdu, Balochi, Pashto, Siraiki, Punjabi) and particularly Sindhi literature in India, Moomal and Suhni being the prominent ones. From the texts of these folktales, and especially Latif's poetry, the role of these very women would appear to dominate the role of men as their counterparts. In Umar-Marvi, if only Latif's poetry is analyzed, less space is dedicated to Umar's role, most of the story/narration refers to difficulties Marvi undergoes as a result of her abduction by the King Umar in the south-eastern part of Sindh. In Moomal-Rano, Moomal's role overwhelms everything else including Rano's character. Sasui-Punhoon is predominantly the story of Sasui's struggle to find her beloved husband who left her, apparently, for good. Only a little chunk is dedicated to Punhoon in this story. Noori-Jam Tamachi is predominantly the romantic tale from Noori's context. Tamachi is just like a source to help substantiate Noori's perspective. Suhni-Mehar is again the story of Suhni's anxiety and trouble she takes to meet Mehar. Mehar is not more than a figment of image. In Lilan-Chanesar, again the supposed protagonist is Lilan. However, in Sorath-Rai Diyach, Sorath, unlike the characters in the aforementioned tales, dominates the story in the spirit, not the material (space given to her in the text). Thus, the story of each of these Eight Heroic Women, little or more, one or the other way, relates to the cultural milieu and substance of the evolutionary process of the peoples living in the regions of old India and current Pakistan.

Deeral was born at Hope Vale Lutheran Mission in Cape York, Queensland and educated at Woorabinda, to which he was evacuated during World War II. Deeral left school at 13 and worked as a labourer and stockman before becoming Chairman of the Hope Vale Mission Community Council in 1957. At a meeting of Guugu Yimithirr clans on Palm Island, Queensland in 1964, elders decided to become more politically involved and nominated Deeral to run for parliament.Stateline (Queensland), \\"Interview with former indigenous MP Eric Deeral\\" (broadcast 18 July 2003), http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/qld/content/2003/s905149.htm, accessed 17 November 2011. Joining the Country Party, Deeral worked with the Queensland Department of Aboriginal Affairs and won pre-selection for the Queensland state seat of Cook (which covered Cape York and the Torres Strait Islands) for the 1974 Queensland state election. Normally a safe Labor seat, Deeral won Cook as part of a landslide win to the National (as the Country Party had been renamed) and Liberal Party coalition.Lunn, p.137. Deeral's victory was considered to be due to the proposal of Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam's plan to realign Australia's Torres Strait border with Papua New Guinea. Deeral became the second Indigenous Australian to be elected to an Australian parliament, after Neville Bonner's election to the Australian Senate in 1971, and the first to a state or territory parliament. While in parliament Deeral advocated for improved roads in his electorate to help develop tourism and other industries, as well as securing improvements to locals schools and medical access. In the lead up to the 1977 state election, Deeral's chances of reelection were hurt when the Queensland Government deferred a national eye health program for Aboriginals currently underway in the electorate of Cook due to allegations of members of the program campaigning for the Labor Party.Lunn, p. 223. At the election, Deeral lost his seat in a swing away from the Nationals, with the deferral of the eye health program given as a factor in the loss.Lunn, p. 224. Following the election loss, Deeral continued to work with local Aboriginal communities, becoming the inaugural chair of the Aboriginal Coordination Council in 1985 and in 1987 was a delegate to the World Heritage Committee session in Paris, as well as appointed as Chairman of the Legislation Review Committee that examined Queensland legislation and its impact on Aboriginal land rights during the early 1990s. From 1998 to 2003, Deeral was a member of the Wet Tropics Management Authority Board and in July 2002 was appointed interim chair of the Yalanji Ang-Narra Yimidihirr Peoples Council, as well as taking an active role as a Guugu Yimithirr elder. In 2012, Queensland's Indigenous Youth Parliament was renamed the Eric Deeral Indigenous Youth Parliament in Deeral's honour. He died later that year.

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia (), also known as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States (ELCROS), is a Lutheran denomination that itself comprises seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. Established in its current form in 1999, ELCROS currently has about 24,050 membersFederation of Evangelical Lutheran Churches in Russia and Other States Lutheran World in more than 400 congregations within its jurisdiction. The constituent dioceses of ELCROS were mostly founded as German Lutheran denominations. However, the church now worships extensively in the Russian language with around 30% of its members being ethnically Russian.Statistics at East West Report. The current archbishop of ELCROS is the Most Rev. Dietrich Brauer. History Lutheranism had established itself in the Teutonic states of the Baltics and Ingria in the early years of the Reformation. Ivan the Terrible invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper. Early history The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in Moscow, St. Michael's Church, was completed in 1576. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons. As a result of the Great Northern War, the former Swedish provinces of Livonia and Estonia, with their large Lutheran populations, were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by Peter the Great. Catherine the Great's policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia. Despite the de facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith, with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only and secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths. Official establishment In 1832, de jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia (ELCR) () was established uniting Lutheran and Reformed congregations in the administrative regions of Russia proper, and the Kingdom of Poland with the Czar as the Supreme Bishop. The ELCR was granted the status of a State Church for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state. In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an Edict of toleration and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the Russian language. By 1914, the Lutheran Church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities. The First World War and the early Soviet era With Russia's joining of the First World War on the side of Triple Entente against the German Empire, a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German-speaking, this severely affected the Lutheran church. The Russian Revolution of 1917 and the end of the First World War in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, with large Lutheran populations, gained independence. In December 1917, schools and seminaries were nationalized; by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned. The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas, bolstered by the participation of whole German- speaking communities on the side of the White Russians against the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War. In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The reorganised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, Artur Malmgren of Leningrad and Theophil Meyer of Moscow. Despite approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran Church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the collectivization policies of Joseph Stalin in 1928 scattered the population, and official anti- religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and, in some cases, their executions. In 1936, Bishop Malmgren left Russia for Germany; by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body. Second World War and the post war period The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of Germans from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurring prior to the German invasion of Russia had the net result of decimating religious life among the German-speaking Lutherans, as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions. The only exception was a Lutheran church in Tselinograd that was established by Eugen Bachmann in 1957 and granted registration the same year. The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing Brethren communities (), in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such Brethren communities, heavily influenced by Pietism, had been in existence since the 19th century but had managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to their fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground Brethren congregations in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches, but they were in most cases unsuccessful The Soviet annexation of the Baltic states in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia registered in 1940 and the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church in 1949, although they, too, were targets of repression and controls. It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register, with the first two being registered in Siberia in 1965. The Rev. Harald Kalnins from the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia (Riga), sponsored by the Lutheran World Federation, was granted permission to visit them periodically from 1969. Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era In 1980, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia appointed Kalnins as superintendent of the German Lutherans in Russia and, with the advent of Perestroika in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union with the blessings of the Lutheran Archbishop of Riga. This allowed the reorganising of congregations and formal seminary training. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the church became known as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States and between 1992 and 1994, synods were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in St. Petersburg, and Georg Kretschmar was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop. Contemporary developments With the passing of Russia's 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran Church in Russia, the demographics had shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities, with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being Russians. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in Novosaratovka near St. Petersburg. Structure St Peter & St Paul Cathedral, Moscow, is the diocesan cathedral of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in European Russia, a constituent diocese of ELCROS. Ecclesiastical authority is vested in the office of the Archbishop, whose nominal seat is the Church of St Peter and St Paul in St Petersburg. The Archbishop and the bishops of the regional Lutheran denominations within ELCROS form an Episcopal Council. The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod, which meets every five years, while executive authority is vested with the Church Synod. The Church Synod is chaired by the General Consistory, headed by the Archbishop, and the Synod further comprises two members from the Episcopal Council and the Presidium of the General Synod. Regional churches The church is further divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. These were formerly independent churches, and still retain their autonomy, but since 1999 they have been united as constituent dioceses of ELCROS. * Evangelical-Lutheran Church in European Russia (European Russia) ** Bishop's seat: St Peter and St Paul Cathedral, Moscow * Evangelical-Lutheran Church of the Urals, Siberia and the Far East (Asian Russia) * German Evangelical- Lutheran Church in the Ukraine * Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Kazakhstan * Evangelical-Lutheran Church in the Kyrgyz Republic (Kyrgyzstan) * Evangelical- Lutheran Church in Uzbekistan * Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Georgia * Union of Evangelical-Lutheran Church Congregations in Belarus * Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Azerbaijan * Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Dushanbe (Tajikistan) Archbishop of ELCROS Archbishop Dietrich Brauer, the primate of ELCROS.

Other terms that are sometimes used are: road profiler, road reclaimer, road miller, road planer and pavement profiler. They are used in the process of full depth recycling. Types of equipment Different countries sometimes use different terminology and it becomes difficult to identify the difference between the machines and the processes involved. Soil stabiliser A soil stabilizer machine. The machine blends existing pavement with lime that has been spread on the surface. Water comes in via the big pipe at the front. A soil stabiliser is a construction vehicle with a powered metal drum that has rows of mixing blades or paddles. It makes soil cement by blending soil, a binder agent (usually Portland cement or lime) and water together with paddles in the mixing chamber instead of a concrete mixer and usually does not cut or mill hard or very thick asphalt or concrete. Modern soil stabilisers are more powerful and often use carbide tips instead of paddles. Some are called single pass soil stabilizers because they can make soil cement in one pass where some of these machines take up to four passes.Scott, John S., \\"single pass soil stabilizer\\", Dictionary of Civil Engineering. 4th ed. New York: Chapman & Hall, 1993. 403. Print. In this way most soil stabilisers have become much more like road recyclers where they can also blend the old road surface in the mixture. Road pavement mill A Wirtgen road pavement profiler (mill) removes the top surface of the road so that a new one can be laid. A road pavement mill is a construction vehicle with a powered metal drum that has rows of tungsten carbide tipped teeth that cut off the top surface of a paved concrete or asphalt road. Usually (since sustainability is now very important) extracts the material for recycling into new asphalt. In some applications the entire road pavement can be removed. The reasons for removal may be that the road surface has become damaged and needs replacing. It is a very high-powered machine, with some using engines above 500 hp. It is usually mounted on four crawler tracks although sometimes on three crawler tracks or on wheels. Road recycler A Bitelli road pavement recycler on wheels. The material is not being recycled here but instead thrown to the side of the road. A road recycler or road reclaimer is an asphalt pavement grinder or a combination grinder and soil stabilizer when it is equipped to blending cement, foamed asphalt and/or lime and water with the existing pavement (usually only very thin asphalt) to create a new, recycled road surface. It usually refers to the process of blending the asphalt road with a binder and base course in a single pass. In the photo below of the milling cutter drums, the front drum with many teeth would be from a pavement mill and would be used to remove very hard asphalt or concrete surfaces. The drums behind with less teeth would be from a road recycler, the teeth are placed in a chevron pattern to reduce the load on the motor. Only a few teeth are cutting at one time and this pattern of teeth placement also serves to auger the material to the centre where it can be picked up easily by a conveyor belt.

He won the Military Cross for bravery at the Butte de Warlencourt where he lost his right hand. He was back at Longueval and Delville Wood in 1919 identifying and burying the dead of his Brigade. After the war he returned to St. John's College and became their headmaster from 1922-1930. He was responsible for the extension of the school's buildings and for the chapel which was dedicated as a war memorial, and contains one of the five crosses made from the remains of the trees at the battle of Delville Wood. Eustace Hill did not approve of contraception and converted to Catholicism in 1938. He became a monk in 1939, taking the name Brother James. He entered a monastery in Hampshire and remained there until his death on 12 February 1953. Early life Eustace St. Clair Hill was born on 15 February 1873 to Agnes Jane Pennell and James Turner Hill, a Major-General of the 4th Bengal Native Infantry. After attending school at Lancing College in Sussex, he went to Christ Church, Oxford where in 1895 he obtained his BA. Thereafter, he studied for the priesthood, being made a deacon in 1896 and being ordained as a priest in 1897. His first posting was as the Curate of Wrexham in North Wales. In 1898, he sailed to South Africa to become the chaplain of St Peter's Home, Grahamstown. Boer War Service In July 1899, after less than a year at St Peter‚Äôs, Eustace Hill volunteered as a chaplain in the event of war breaking out between the Boers and the British. After the Boer War had broken out in September of that year, Hill was attached to Lord Methuen's column. This column was sent to relieve the siege of Kimberley and later Mafeking. During this time, he was involved in ministering to the British soldiers at Modder River and Magersfontein, two of the major battles in this theatre of the war. In April 1900 Hill became sick with fever and returned to England on three months' sick leave. By the time he arrived back in South Africa in July 1900, Mafeking had been relieved and Pretoria had fallen. The Boer War had become a guerilla war. The British forces roamed the countryside trying to pin the Boer forces down by trapping them between two forces and by depriving them of local support through the destruction of their farms and houses, and through the internment of their families. Padre Hill was involved in supporting these roving groups though he was not popular by his insistence on preventing any looting or maltreatment of the Boers. After the Boer War In April 1901, Eustace Hill was appointed Assistant Chaplain to the Railway Mission at Naauwpoort in the Eastern Cape, as well as being responsible for ministering to the soldiers of the nearby military camp. In 1904 he joined the Community of the Resurrection, an Anglican religious order that had been founded in 1892. In 1905 he was appointed to the staff of St John‚Äôs College in Johannesburg. He took a leave of absence from the school in 1906 to support the colonial forces involved in suppressing the Bambata rebellion. Chaplain on the Western Front Again Padre Hill was one of the first to volunteer his services as a military chaplain in 1914. He initially saw action at Luderitz in South West Africa with the SA Expeditionary Force. He was then involved in the Senussi campaign in Egypt the following year. In 1916 he was transferred to Europe where he served on the Western Front. In July 1916 he was intimately involved in the Somme battles of Longueval and Delville Wood. At Butte de Warlencourt, he lost his right arm and was awarded the Military Cross in late 1916. At Marrieres Wood on 24 March 1918, he was captured and served the remainder of the war as a prisoner of war. He was released in November 1918. St John‚Äôs College He returned to St. John's College and became their headmaster from 1922-1930. Though somewhat eccentric as a result of his war experiences, his elevation to the post brought a sense of vigour to the school. He was responsible for the extension of the school's buildings and particularly for the magnificent chapel which was dedicated in 1926. Fittingly, the chapel was dedicated as a war memorial and contains one of the five crosses made from the remains of the trees at the battle of Delville Wood. Later life In 1930 at the Seventh Lambeth Conference, the Anglican Church approved birth control under limited circumstances. Eustace Hill did not approve of contraception and converted to Catholicism in 1938. He became a monk in 1939, taking the name Brother James. He entered a monastery in Hampshire and remained there until his death on 12 February 1953, three days short of his eightieth birthday. Padre Hill never married. Bravery Hill‚Äôs bravery, coupled with an unshakeable belief in the rightness of what he was doing, meant that he had little concern for his own personal safety. He did not hesitate to take his very practical ministry to the front line and consequently became well known for his bravery. At Butte de Warlencourt, he received the third highest award for bravery, the Military Cross. Hill absolutely abhorred any form of cowardice and spent considerable effort exhorting his men to do their Christian duty under fire. He didn‚Äôt question the purpose or shy away from the danger but rather exhorted the soldiers with words such as ‚ÄúMen, they may kill your bodies, but they cannot destroy your souls‚Äù.Uys, p91 One example of his bravery was when, during the Boer War he received a curt note from Lord Methuen that ‚Äúif he was seen in the front line again he would be sent home‚Äù.Gibbs, p3 On the Western Front, he was legendary for standing up and moving around the battlefield dodging artillery shells and machine gun bullets in pursuit of his ministry. Hill the Military Chaplain Though Padre Hill came from a distinguished military family and had a very rigid approach to the business of soldiering, he had a real vocation for the priesthood and particularly for the pastoral side of ministry. One is puzzled by the contrast between his keenness to participate in any military adventure with his very real concern for the suffering of the soldiers. Hill deplored war ‚Äì he saw no glory in it but never questioned the rightness of it. In some respects, his absolute belief in the duty for all soldiers to fight like men and to die if necessary must have been the result of his family‚Äôs military background and also because of the nature of the late Victorian Imperial culture in which he was born. During the Boer War Padre Hill established an effective way for military chaplains to function within the military under conflict situations, and it was this experience that made him so much loved and respected by the troops and a national hero in the First World War. Hill also campaigned for the establishment of an independent chaplaincy corps within the military. Notes References * Gibbs, D.F.

Rob Voerman (born May 6, 1966, Deventer) is a Dutch graphic artist, sculptor and installation artist. His works generally show futuristic architectural constructions in a post-apocalyptic world full of destruction, explosions and the remains of conflict and catastrophe. Biography Voerman studied at the CABK in Kampen which is now ArtEZ Art & Design in Zwolle (1990‚Äì1996). In 2001 Voerman applied to join Worldviews, an art in residence programme in New York City. The programme used studios at the top of one of the World Trade Center towers-studios with a spectacular of the city. The programme though never started because of the attacks of September 11, 2001. In the following year Voerman made the work Worldviews which referred to 9/11 and the idea of this residency that never happened. Work Architecture, instability and deconstruction are central themes in the two- dimensional work and sculptures of Rob Voerman. His works are defined by a dialogue between the forms of old archaic appearances of the farmers-life and the modern technically developed society. The improvised constructions of his works reminds one of the anonymous architecture of sheds as can be seen on small farms and in gardens. Modern architecture was partially transformed and integrated by this archaic way of building. In his own words Voerman tries \\"to create the architecture of fictive communities living in remote areas or occupying existing citylandscapes. The communities will consist of a mixture of utopia , destruction and beauty.\\"robvoerman.nl Voermans three-dimensional works are made of many different materials such as cardboard, glass, plexiglass, and wood. The sculptures recall the memory of a primitive hut but at the same time the technological achievements of the machine age. In Voermans sculptures different typologies of architecture, furniture and machines blend together. An example is Moonshine (2006), which is a table but at the same time a maquette of a ruined flatbuilding. The work also functions as a bar and a smoking area. A bar full of alcoholic drinks is built into the table and there is an ashtray mounted in it too.S. Folie D. van der Leer T. Nolet, 2010, Rob Voerman, Aftermath, Valiz Amsterdam, 153 Exhibitions There have been exhibitions of Voermans work in Amsterdam, London, New York, Los Angeles, Berlin, Bregenz and Newcastle upon Tyne.

It houses a collection of artefacts from the archaeological culture. It is located in Liangzhu, in the northwestern outskirts of Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province, China. Origin of the name The culture was first discovered in a small township called Liangzhu, in Hangzhou, Zhejiang in 1931, and so similar discoveries found near the site are altogether called Liangzhu culture. The Liangzhu culture is also known as the Jade culture and dates from 3000 BC. The Museum is built on the site where many Liangzhu treasures were unearthed. History of the museum The museum was designed by David Chipperfield Architects and completed in 2007. The site was previously a contaminated industrial site, and has been landscaped into a park by Levin Monsigny Landschaftsarchitekten, with hills and manmade streams. The project took five years to design and construct, and was developed in conjunction with ZTUDI, the Architectural Design and Research Institute at Zhejiang University of Technology. Museum Layout The Museum is stone-clad with Iranian travertine stone and is surrounded on three sides by a man-made lake. It is built around an abstract geometrical design, comprising four blocks, all 18 m wide but different heights, and lengths. Five internal courtyards punctuate the space, connecting the galleries and allowing the entry of daylight. Visitors enter the building via a bridge across the lake, echoing the aquaculture and irrigation systems of the Liangzhu people. The site uses more than 40,000 square meters, including 10,000 square meters of gross area, which consist of three conventional and a temporary exhibition and other function rooms. A courtyard at the back gives access across a second bridge to a small island on which outdoor exhibitions can be displayed.

Ely (July 23, 1846 - October 29, 1916) was an executive in charge of steam locomotive power development and purchases on the Pennsylvania Railroad, one of the largest railroad systems and business concerns in the United States. The Pennsylvania's Theodore N. Ely at the time of his retirement in 1911 Upon his retirement in 1911 after forty-three years with the Pennsylvania, the trade periodical Railway Age Gazette recounted Ely's career, his accomplishments and accolades. Perhaps his most recognizable innovation, per Railway Age Gazette, was the relocation of the steam locomotive boiler and fire box. Prior to the 1881-3 design of the Pennsylvania's Class K 4-4-0 American Standard steam locomotives (later reclassified to the Pennsylvania's Class D6 4-4-0 American Standards), most fire boxes were located between the frames of locomotives, restricting their width, and thus, the power of the locomotive. Ely's design moved the fire box and boiler assembly above the drive wheels, creating a design which was more powerful, as well as easier to stoke. The area available to burn coal, and thus power the locomotive, was increased from eighteen to nearly thirty-five square feet. The change, considered radical at the time, created a design which observers believed would run roughly and prove top-heavy and unstable. Railway Age Gazette noted in 1911: \\"It was Mr. Ely that took the first step alone, against the protests of many by whom he was surrounded, that has led to the development of the large locomotives of today. While builders and engineers considered that the end had come, that the locomotive had reached the limit of its power because of the restrictions current construction put upon the size of the firebox, Mr. Ely lifted his whole boiler into the air, set his foundation ring on top of the frames, widened his firebox and gave the machine a new lease of life. Many and dire were the predictions made as to the instability of the new design, but we all know the result. It did not upset, but ran with unexampled smoothness and with construction revolutionized the whole country followed in his wake. This is but a single example of his work.\\" The design proved so revolutionary that \\"Ely's No. 10,\\" one of the class K American Standards, was issued as a U.S. postage stamp in 1977. The U.S. Postal Service wrote of Ely's design: \\"It was among the fastest express locomotives in the United States during the 1880s. No. 10 was a prototype and considered a remarkably advanced design at the time of its introduction.\\" In his retirement tribute, the Gazette included an anecdote from an unnamed co- worker off the Pennsylvania: \\"As one of his associates expressed it, 'He was the balance wheel of the mechanical organization of the road,' and if these same associates are to be believed it is to his influence that the wonderful teamwork of the various departments is largely due.\\" By 1911 Ely was a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Institution of Civil Engineers (Great Britain), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the American Institute of Mining Engineers, the Franklin Institute, the American Philosophical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, other technical and scientific associations, vice-president of the American Academy in Rome and an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects, president of the Eastern Railroad Association, a member of the executive committee of the American Railway Association and of the permanent commission of the International Railway Congress. Ely was also a director of the Pennsylvania Steel Company and the Cambria Steel Company and of the boards of trustees of the Drexel Institute of Art Science and Industry and of the Philadelphia Commercial Museum. Before his retirement, Ely was awarded an honorary Masters of Arts by Yale University in 1897. In 1904 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science by Hamilton College. He died October 28, 1916, at his home Wyndham, at Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. For his contributions to early American railroading Ely is listed by the Smithsonian Institutions' John H. White, Jr., as one of America's most noteworthy railroaders. His daughter Gertrude Sumner Ely was twice awarded the Croix de Guerre for bravery in World War I; another daughter, Katrina Brandes Ely, married Charles L. Tiffany II in 1901, and was president of the New York Collegiate Equal Franchise League.  References  * Busbey, T. Addison, editor.

The ancient name of Hassanabad was Kusting, which means a large storage of water. It is said that in ancient times the lama (Bhudhist spiritual leader), who ruled the area name was Lama Kastiyang. and the name kusting was derived from the lama's name. The language spoken is Balti. The entire population is Muslim of the Sofia Noorbakhshia In the past it was the trade route to Ladakh and Kargil.  Geography  Hassanabad has an average elevation of about , and is situated along the banks of the Shyok River, a tributary of the Indus. Villages near Hassanabad includes Marcha, Dawoo, Piun, Partuk, Siksa and Franu. The mountains and surrounding have generally no forests however there are some shrubs and herbs available which are generally used by the local communities as medicinal herbs and for their cattle, The Shyok River passing nearby the village is one of the important resources for irrigating the whole lands. However the same river sometime creates havoc during summer through its unpredictable floods. Administrartion Hassanabad consists of 7 block. Painkhor, Gabkhor, Thangkhor, Hajipakhor, Goostrang, Komick and Oraitan Climate The climate of Hassanabad during the summer is moderated by its mountain setting and the intense heat of lowland Pakistan does not reach here. The mountains also block out the summer monsoon and summer rainfall is thus quite low. However, these mountains result in very severe winter weather. During the April to October temperatures vary between a maximum of 27 ¬∞C and a minimum (in October) 8 ¬∞C. However, temperatures can drop to below -26 ¬∞C in the December-to-February midwinter period. Resources The natural resources of the village include agriculture, horticultural resources, the Shyok River, mountains and peaks. The agriculture in the village is only summer based due to extreme cold in the winter where temperature goes to -10 C. The crops include some beans, maize, potatoes, and other food crops however communities have experimented less with the agriculture due to the natural limiting factors i.e. extreme cold. Transport Hassanabad is accessible only by the road, The normal route to Hassanabad is via Shyok Valley Road, that connect it to the District Headquarters Khaplu and to Skardu. The climate can have adverse effects on transport in and out of the Hassanabad, as the roads in and out of can be blocked for weeks.

The scene is shown with a combination of direct lighting and ambient occlusion lighting to improve the visibility of pockets and cavities. The VMD axes are shown as an example of rendering of non-molecular geometry.350x350px Intel iPSC/860 32-node parallel computer running a Tachyon performance test. August 22, 1995. Tachyon is a parallel/multiprocessor ray tracing software. It is a parallel ray tracing library for use on distributed memory parallel computers, shared memory computers, and clusters of workstations. Tachyon implements rendering features such as ambient occlusion lighting, depth-of-field focal blur, shadows, reflections, and others. It was originally developed for the Intel iPSC/860 by John Stone for his M.S. thesis at University of Missouri-Rolla. Tachyon subsequently became a more functional and complete ray tracing engine, and it is now incorporated into a number of other open source software packages such as VMD, and SageMath. Tachyon is released under a permissive license (included in the tarball).  Evolution and Features  Tachyon was originally developed for the Intel iPSC/860, a distributed memory parallel computer based on a hypercube interconnect topology based on the Intel i860, an early RISC CPU with VLIW architecture and . Tachyon was originally written using Intel's proprietary NX message passing interface for the iPSC series, but it was ported to the earliest versions of MPI shortly thereafter in 1995. Tachyon was adapted to run on the Intel Paragon platform using the Paragon XP/S 150 MP at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The ORNL XP/S 150 MP was the first platform Tachyon supported that combined both large-scale distributed memory message passing among nodes, and shared memory multithreading within nodes. Adaptation of Tachyon to a variety of conventional Unix-based workstation platforms and early clusters followed, including porting to the IBM SP2. Tachyon was incorporated into the PARAFLOW CFD code to allow in-situ volume visualization of supersonic combustor flows performed on the Paragon XP/S at NASA Langley Research Center, providing a significant performance gain over conventional post-processing visualization approaches that had been used previously. Beginning in 1999, support for Tachyon was incorporated into the molecular graphics program VMD, and this began an ongoing period co-development of Tachyon and VMD where many new Tachyon features were added specifically for molecular graphics. Tachyon was used to render the winning image illustration category for the NSF 2004 Visualization Challenge. In 2007, Tachyon added support for ambient occlusion lighting, which was one of the features that made it increasingly popular for molecular visualization in conjunction with VMD. VMD and Tachyon were gradually adapted to support routine visualization and analysis tasks on clusters, and later for large petascale supercomputers. Tachyon was used to produce figures, movies, and the Nature cover image of the atomic structure of the HIV-1 capsid solved by Zhao et al. in 2013, on the Blue Waters petascale supercomputer at NCSA, U. Illinois.  Use in Parallel Computing Demonstrations, Training, and Benchmarking  Owing in part to its portability to a diverse range of platforms Tachyon has been used as a test case for a variety of parallel computing and compiler research articles. In 1999, John Stone assisted Bill Magro with adaptation of Tachyon to support early versions of the OpenMP directive-based parallel computing standard, using Kuck and Associates' KCC compiler. Tachyon was shown as a demo performing interactive ray tracing on DEC Alpha workstations using KCC and OpenMP. In 2000, Intel acquired Kuck and Associates Inc., and Tachyon continued to be used as an OpenMP demonstration. Intel later used Tachyon to develop a variety of programming examples for its Threading Building Blocks (TBB) parallel programming system, where an old version of the program continues to be incorporated as an example to the present day. In 2006, Tachyon was selected by the SPEC HPG for inclusion in the SPEC MPI 2007 benchmark suite. Beyond Tachyon's typical use as tool for rendering high quality images, likely due to its portability and inclusion in SPEC MPI 2007, it has also been used as a test case and point of comparison for a variety of research projects related to parallel rendering and visualization, cloud computing, and parallel computing, compilers, runtime systems, and computer architecture, performance analysis tools, and energy efficiency of HPC systems.

The first person of African heritage to arrive in Texas was Estevanico, who came to Texas in 1528.  History  The first Africans that lived in Texas were Afro-Mexicans when Texas was still a part of Mexico before the Mexican-American war. African slaves arrived in 1528 in Spanish Texas.https://www.thestoryoftexas.com/discover/campfire- stories/african-americans In 1792, there was 34 blacks and 414 mulattos in Spanish Texas.https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/african-americans Anglo white immigration into Mexican Texas in the 1820s brung an increased numbers of slaves.https://www.thc.texas.gov/public/upload/African-Americans- in-Texas-2016.pdf  Population  Many African Americans in Texas remained in slavery until after the U.S. Civil War ended. There was scarce Union Army activity in Texas, preventing them from joining the Northern lines. Some escaped over the borders to areas where the Union Army was operating. The announcement of emancipation was delayed until June 19, 1865, when officials announced that slavery had been formally abolished. This is celebrated in Texas as Juneteenth. African Americans left Texas by the tens of thousands during the Great Migration in the first half of the 20th century, seeking work and political opportunities elsewhere. As of the 2010 U.S. Census, African Americans were 11.9% of the state's population. The long-term effects of slavery can be seen to the present in the state's demographics. The eastern quarter of the state, where cotton production depended on thousands of slaves, is the westernmost extension of the Deep South and contains a very significant number of Texas' African-American population. Texas has one of the largest African-American populations in the country. African Americans are concentrated in northern, eastern and east-central Texas as well as the Dallas, Houston and San Antonio metropolitan areas. African Americans form 24 percent of both the cities of Dallas and Houston, 19% of Fort Worth, 8.1 percent of Austin, and 7.5 percent of San Antonio. The African American population in Texas is increasing due to the New Great Migration. In addition to the descendants of the state's former slave population, many African American college graduates have come to the state for work recently in the New Great Migration. A 2014 University of Texas at Austin study observed that the state's capital city of Austin was the only U.S. city with a high growth rate that was nevertheless losing African Americans, due to suburbanization and gentrification.Donahue, Emily and David Brown. \\"Austin's the Only Fast-Growing City in the Country Losing African-Americans\\" (Archive). KUT. Moody College of Communication at the University of Texas at Austin, Friday May 16, 2014. Retrieved on May 20, 2014. In 2018, African-Americans had the second highest net growth in population in Texas compared to 2010. Harris County accounted for the largest percentage of that growth.https://www.texastribune.org/2019/06/20/texas-hispanic-population-pace- surpass-white-residents/ Harris County's largest city Houston is now known as a center of African-American political power, education, economic prosperity, and culture, often called the next black mecca.  Historically black colleges and universities in Texas  There are seven historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in Texas. Texas Southern University (largest) and Prairie View A&M; University (second largest) are the two most notable HBCUs in Texas and annually produce a significant portion of college degreed African-American in the state.

L√∂ring, by trade, was an electrician and after his active career started an electrical business. He also dealt in real estate. As a football player, L√∂ring fielded for Preu√üen Dellbr√ºck, later to become Viktoria K√∂ln (1955‚Äì61), and Alemannia Aachen (1961‚Äì62), in the Oberliga West. In 1967, he took over as chairman of Fortuna K√∂ln. Throughout his time in this position, he is estimated to have supported the club with between DM 30 and 40 million, eventually leading to his own insolvency. After having to declare insolvency, L√∂ring was rarely seen in public, as he felt embarrassed about it. His club, Fortuna K√∂ln, was only able to survive in professional football through his financial help, rarely enjoying good support in Cologne and consequently, after his departure, the club itself became insolvent. Fortuna declined as far as the sixth division Verbandsliga but has since made a partial recovery. In the time as chairman of the club, Fortuna's greatest success was reaching the Bundesliga in 1973, where it lasted for only one season, and making a losing appearance in the German Cup final in 1983, against local rival 1. FC K√∂ln. L√∂ring spend his final years mostly alone, accompanied only by his four dogs.L√∂ring verbittert und allein zu Haus: Fortuna K√∂ln war sein Schicksal Die Welt, published: 6 February 2003, accessed: 18 December 2011 Character Jean L√∂ring was one of the most colorful figures in German football. In December 1999, when his club was 0‚Äì2 behind against Waldhof Mannheim he sacked coach Toni Schumacher, the former national team goalkeeper, at half time. Because the assistant coach left with Schumacher he himself coached the team for the rest of the game and promptly lost 1‚Äì5. Throughout his time with Fortuna he took up the double role, serving as chairman and coach, on five occasions. When L√∂ring was banned from the stadium for a game because he verbally attacked a referee he decided to dress up as Santa Claus and watch the game from the stands without being identified. Hans Krankl, who was briefly coach at Fortuna, when joining the club was told how difficult L√∂ring was but found him to be one of the nicest people he ever met in football and described him as a grandfatherly figure. Death L√∂ring, suffering from cancer, died at the Hospiz Dr.-Mildred- Scheel-Haus in Cologne on 6 March 2005. He was buried at the S√ºdfriedhof, located in K√∂ln-Zollstock. After L√∂ring's death it was discussed to rename the home of Fortuna, the S√ºdstadion, after him.

Reception No Way Out scandalized critics of the radical left who discovered that for most of the characters real life prototypes could be found, and its central figure, Beloyartsev, was obviously a caricature of author and social activist Vasily Sleptsov. All this seemed to confirm the view, now rooted in the Russian literary community, that Leskov was a right- wing, 'reactionary' author. In April Dmitry Pisarev wrote in his \\"The Walk In the Russian Literature Garden\\" (Russkoye slovo, 1865, #3) review: \\"Can there be found anywhere in Russia any other magazine, except for The Russian Messenger, that would venture on publishing anything written by and signed as, Stebnitsky? Could there be found one single honest writer in Russia who'd be so careless, so indifferent as to his reputation, so as to contribute to a magazine that adorns itself with novels and novelets by Stebnitsky?\\" The social democrat-controlled press started spreading rumours that No Way Out had been 'commissioned' by the Interior Ministry's 3rd Department. What Leskov condemned as \\"a vicious libel\\" caused great harm to his career: popular journals boycotted him, while Mikhail Katkov of the conservative The Russian Messenger greeted him as a political ally. Presenting the copy of the novel's second edition to historian, publicist and editor Pyotr Schebalsky, Leskov enclosed a short entry, summarizing his view on the novel that made him both famous and infamous. In the early 20th century the attitude in Russia towards this novel started to change. Maxim Gorky wrote: \\"In No Way Out almost every characters is ridiculous or evil, most are ignorant of reality, garrulous, self-important types, who indeed have nowhere to go. But what was more important to Leskov was to show among this pathetic, dishonest mob real heroes whom he could sympathise, like that of Rainer. Rainer calls himself a Socialist, bravely promotes Socialism in Russia and dies as a hero in the Polish uprising in 1865. Leskov surrounded Rainer with a halo of gallantry and saintliness.\\" Leskov himself wrote later: \\"For all the gallery of vile nihilists I've created there were heroes like Rainer, Liza and Pomada ‚Äì kind of characters none of the nihilist sympathizer author would be able to come up with.\\" D.S. Mirsky too expressed bewilderment at how Leskov, after his first novel No Way Out, could have been seriously regarded as 'vile and libelous reactionary', when in reality (according to the critic) \\"the principal Socialist characters in the book were represented as little short of saints.\\" References  External links  * –ù–µ–∫—É–¥–∞.

Rereplication is believed to lead to genomic instability and has been implicated in the pathologies of a variety of human cancers. To prevent rereplication, eukaryotic cells have evolved multiple, overlapping mechanisms to inhibit chromosomal DNA from being partially or fully rereplicated in a given cell cycle. These control mechanisms rely on cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. DNA replication control mechanisms cooperate to prevent the relicensing of replication origins and to activate cell cycle and DNA damage checkpoints. DNA rereplication must be strictly regulated to ensure that genomic information is faithfully transmitted through successive generations. Initiating Replication at Origins Replication of DNA always begins at an origin of replication. In yeast, the origins contain autonomously replicating sequences (ARS), distributed throughout the chromosome about 30 kb from each other. They allow replication of DNA wherever they are placed. Each one is 100-200 bp long, and the A element is one of the most conserved stretches. Along with other conserved B elements, they form the section where the ORCs assemble to begin replication. The repetition of these sequences may be the most important to origin recognition. In animal cells, replication origins may seem to be randomly placed throughout the chromosome, sometimes even acting as ARSs, but local chromatin structure plays a large role in determining where replication will occur. The replication origins are not distributed evenly throughout the chromosome. Replicon clusters, containing 20-80 origins per cluster, are activated at the same time during S phase. Although they are all activated during S phase, heterochromatin tends to be replicated in late S phase, as they are more difficult to access than euchromatin. Epigenetic factors also have a large influence on what gets replicated and when it gets replicated.Morgan, D. O. (2007). The cell cycle: principles of control. New Science Press. Origin licensing All known mechanisms that prevent DNA rereplication in eukaryotic organisms inhibit origin licensing. Origin licensing is the preliminary step for normal replication initiation during late G1 and early S phase and involves the recruitment of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) to the replication origins. Licensing begins with the binding of the multi-subunit ATPase, the origin recognition complex (ORC), to the DNA at the replication origins. Once bound to chromatin the ORC recruits the AAA+ ATPase Cdc6 and the coiled-coil domain protein Cdt1. Cdt1 binding and the ATPase activity of ORC and Cdc6 facilitate the loading of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins 2-7 onto the chromatin. The MCM complex is the DNA helicase that opens the helix at the replication origin and unwinds the two strands as the replication forks travel along the DNA. Elevated CDK activity at the end of G1 triggers the firing of the origins and the dismantling of the pre-RCs. High CDK levels, which are maintained until the end of mitosis, inhibit or destroy pre-RC components and prevent the origin from relicensing. A new MCM complex cannot be loaded onto the origin until the pre-RC subunits are reactivated with the decline of CDK activity at the end of mitosis. Thus, CDKs serve a dual role in the regulation of eukaryotic DNA replication: elevated CDK activity initiates replication at the origins and prevents rereplication by inhibiting origin re-licensing. This ensures that no replication origin fires twice in the same cell cycle. Two-state model for DNA replication regulation S. cerevisiae origin in the prereplicative state. Assembly of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) readies the origin for firing. S. cerevisiae origin in the postreplicative state. CDK-mediated phosphorylation of the pre-RC components prevents origins from re-licensing. Early experimental evidence on the regulation of DNA replication suggests that replication origins exist in one of two states during the cell cycle: a prereplicative state in G1 and a postreplicative state from the moment of initiation until passage through mitosis. Origins of replication alternate between these two distinct states during the cell cycle. A licensing factor which is required for replication initiation binds to origins in the prereplicative state. At the G1/S transition, the factor is inactivated and cannot be restored until the cell cycle has concluded. The identification and characterization of the ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, and the MCM complex proteins as the licensing factor gives credence to this model and suggests a means by which the oscillatory nature of CDKs in the cell cycle can regulate rereplication. Replication regulation Budding yeast Rereplication regulation is best understood in budding yeast. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells prevent rereplication by directly regulating pre-RC assembly through the CDK-mediated phosphorylation of the pre-RC components Cdc6, MCM2-7, and the ORC subunits. The phosphorylation of these components is initiated at the onset of S phase and is maintained throughout the rest of the cell cycle as CDK activity remains high. Phosphorylated Cdc6 is bound by the ubiquitin-protein ligase SCF which leads to its proteolytic degradation. CDK-dependent phosphorylation of the MCM2-7 proteins results in the complex's export from the nucleus. (Cdt1 which associates with the MCM complex is similarly exported from the nucleus). Phosphorylation of the ORC subunits presumably disrupts the ORC's ability to bind other pre-RC components. Thus, multiple mechanisms ensure that the pre-RC cannot be reassembled on postreplicative origins. Note: Since origins fire at different times throughout S phase, it is crucial that the inhibitory mechanisms that prevent new MCM2-7 recruitment do not destabilize existing pre-RCs. Pre-RCs can remain assembled on origins that haven't fired even though rereplication inhibitory mechanisms are inhibiting or destroying pre-RC components. Other organisms Although CDK regulation of pre-RC assembly appears to be highly evolutionarily conserved, some differences across organisms are noted. In multicellular eukaryotes pre-RC assembly is regulated by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) in addition to CDKs. APC, an E3 enzyme, ubiquitinates the protein geminin and targets it for degradation. Geminin normally prevents origin licensing by binding to and inhibiting Cdt1. In G1, APC activity is adequate to suppress the accumulation of geminin, thereby indirectly promoting pre-RC assembly. At the end of G1, APC is inactivated and geminin can accumulate and prevent origin re-licensing. Cdt1 is usually upregulated by E2F-mediated transcriptional activation and by binding of human acetylase to Orc1. Proteolytic degradation of Cdt1 is a conserved mechanism in various higher order eukaryotes as well. Cdt1 is degraded through the Cul4‚ÄìDdb1‚ÄìCdt2 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex so that DNA licensing control is maintained in S and G2. Cdt1 is an important regulatory protein, and evolution has led to different pathways of regulation in different organisms. Overexpression of Cdt1 or incactivation of Geminin can lead to re-replication, as undegraded Cdt1 will induce pre-RC assembly.Lan N. Truong, Xiaohua Wu; Prevention of DNA re-replication in eukaryotic cells, Journal of Molecular Cell Biology, Volume 3, Issue 1, 1 February 2011, Pages 13‚Äì22 Pre-RC regulation in most animals is still not well understood. Consequences of rereplication in eukaryotic cells Rereplication and mitotic failure are generally not programmed events, but rather result spontaneously from defects in the cell cycle machinery. Rereplication appears to give rise to dsDNA breaks which triggers a DNA damage response and arrests cells in G2. The checkpoint effectively causes a permanent cell cycle arrest and eventual apoptosis. Rereplication can be experimentally induced by simultaneously disrupting several of the mechanisms that prevent origin re- licensing. For example, deregulation of the ORC, MCM2-7 and Cdc6 mechanisms can induce rereplication in budding yeast cells. Note: Recent evidence suggests that although overlapping, the multiple replication regulation mechanisms should not be considered as functionally redundant; although a single mechanism may repress rereplication at greater than 99% efficiency, it may not be sufficient to maintain genome stability over many generations. Instead, it is believed that the multiplicative effect of many overlapping mechanisms is what sufficiently prevents rereplication and ensures the faithful transmission of a cell's genome. Preventing Rereplication Cells with replication stress activate replication checkpoints so that S phase is delayed and slows down the transition to G2/M phase. When replicative stress is recognized by U-2-OS cells, human osteosarcoma cell lines with wild-type retinoblastoma (RB) and p53, the ATM/ATR-regulated DNA damage network is activated.Bartkova, J., Ho≈ôej≈°√≠, Z., Koed, K., Kr√§mer, A., Tort, F., Zieger, K., ... & √òrntoft, T. (2005). DNA damage response as a candidate anti-cancer barrier in early human tumorigenesis. Nature, 434(7035), 864. This checkpoint response activates due to overexpression of cyclin E, which has been shown to be important in regulating the licensing system.Blow, J. J., & Dutta, A. (2005). Preventing re-replication of chromosomal DNA. Nature reviews Molecular cell biology, 6(6), 476. When cyclin E is overexpressed in U-2-OS cell lines, the ATM/ATR-regulated DNA damage network results in increases in Ser 15-phosphorylated p53, Œ≥-H2AX, and Ser 966-phosphorylated cohesin SMC1. The DNA re-replication response is different from the response taken when damage is due to oxygen radical generation. Damage from oxygen radical generations leads to a response from the Myc oncogene, which phosphorylates p53 and H2AX. The ATM/ATR DNA damage network will also respond to cases where there is an overexpression of Cdt1. Overexpression of Cdt1 leads to accumulation of ssDNA and DSBs. Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) is activated earlier when it detects ssDNA in the earlier phases of DNA re-replication. ATR phosphorylates downstream replication factors, such as RPA2 and MCM2 or through modulation of Rb or p53. Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activates after a larger amount of DSBs is detected at later stages of DNA re- replication. While ATM plays a role in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence, it is also suspected to play a role in mediating DSB repair, but the exact mechanisms are not understood yet. Rereplication in cancer Rereplication has been implicated in tumorigenesis in model organisms and humans. Replication initiation proteins are overexpressed in tissue samples from several types of human cancers and experimental overexpression of Cdt1 and Cdc6 can cause tumor development in mouse cells. Similarly, Geminin ablation in knockout mice has been reported to enhance tumor formation. Further, these studies indicate that rereplication can result in an increase in aneuploidy, chromosomal fusions, and DNA breaks. A thorough understanding of the regulatory replication mechanisms is important for the development of novel cancer treatments. In yeast, increased activity of G1 CDK activity usually inhibits the assembly of pre-RCs and entry into S phase with less active origins, but in cancer cells, p53 and Rb/E2F pathways are deregulated and allow entry into S phase with a reduced amount of active origins. This leads to double-strand breaks in the DNA, increased recombination, and incorrect chromosomal arrangements. The mechanism by which this damage occurs is still not known. One possibility is that reduced origin activation leads to incomplete DNA replication. Significant re-replication is only observed when all CDK regulatory pathways are inhibited.Hills, S. A., & Diffley, J. F. (2014). DNA replication and oncogene-induced replicative stress. Current biology, 24(10), R435-R444 In mammalian cells, Cdt1 and Cdc6 are much more important to re-replication regulation. Overexpression of Cdt1 and Cdc6 were found in 43/75 cases of non-small cell lung carcinomas. Targeting Cdc6 or ORC in mammalian cells does not cause substantial re-replication. Overexpression of Cdt1, on the other hand, can lead to potentially lethal re-replication levels on its own. This response is seen only in cancer cells. Overexpression of E2F family members contributes to an increase in Cdt1 and Cdc6 expression. Loss of p53 regulation in cells can also be observed frequently in cell lines that overexpress Cdt1 or Cdc6. Endoreduplication For the special case of cell cycle-regulated DNA replication in which DNA synthesis is uncoupled from cell cycle progression refer to endoreduplication. Endoreduplication is an important and widespread mechanism in many cell types. It does not adhere to many of the cell cycle checkpoints and damage controls in regularly dividing cells, but it does not result in uncontrolled re-replication. Endoreduplication is a controlled process and occurs to perform a specific cell function. In some cells, it has been proposed that endoreduplication is used as a way to store nucleotides for embryogenesis and germination. In other cases, endoreduplication may be used in cells that are only used for storage of nutrients. Despite its useful functioning in many cells, endoreduplication has also been observed in cancerous cells, and it is not fully understood whether endoreduplication leads to cancerous behavior or whether other mutations lead to endoreduplication. Other mechanisms may be involved in mediating these changes.Lee, H. O., Davidson, J. M., & Duronio, R. J. (2009). Endoreplication: polyploidy with purpose. Genes & development, 23(21), 2461-2477.

It allows substantial degree of flexibility by specifying parameters on command line, including the ability to invoke a third-party utility to manipulate the resulting screenshot.  Description  Features of the program include the ability to limit the scope of capturing to a specific screen area, to set the delay (if needed to capture some menu or another UI element which is shown only when focused) and to specify the filename template using wildcards (including those of the strftime function from the C standard library). Other features include creating thumbnails of the taken screenshots and specifying the quality of the resulting image if lossy format is required. The scrot utility follows the UNIX philosophy principles formulated by Doug McIlroy: the only thing it does is screen capturing, though it allows one to specify a command for further manipulations of a resulting file. The ability to control scrot from the command line allows the user to run it over the network with tools like OpenSSH to get a screenshot of a remote desktop or execute it as the window manager command binding. In February 2019, Scrot was forked as part of the Resurrecting Open Source Project. This updated fork is being used for the Arch Linux package of scrot.

Ordering and delivery  In the 1920s VR was concerned about the low power and speed of their existing class Vk1-3 class locomotives that were used in local services, especially on the Helsinki commuter rail services. A decision was reached to order a new and powerful, by standards of that time, local traffic locomotive from Hanomag with the intention of licence manufacture of more units by Finnish locomotive works. At the same time a shunting locomotive based on a similar design, Vr3, was also ordered. The classes share many parts such as frames, boiler and space for coal, but wheel arrangement, domes and top speed are very different because of their completely different roles. The locomotive was of tank design with small coal bunker in the rear, which limited operational range. The first batch of six locomotives was delivered in 1924 by Hanomag. Later examples were manufactured in Finland with the last being delivered in 1926.Katajisto (1985), p. 42.  Operational history  Locomotives were placed in Helsinki local services immediately after delivery. They were especially designed for this. Since Helsinki was and is a dead-end terminus with no turntables, Pr1's were designed so that they could be run in both directions without turning the locomotive. Both ends had cowcatchers and normal lights. Also the speed limit was 80 km/h in both directions. Generally Pr1's were run with front / boiler end pointing at Helsinki central railway station. Pr1's pulled mostly local wooden-carriage passenger trains, but they also performed shunting duties at Helsinki harbours and pulled local freight. The Pr1 was considered to have a high tractive effort and it had good acceleration. Pr1's were among the rare locomotive types in Finland which were for some time oil-burning at the end of 1940s. Otherwise these locomotives were both coal and wood-burners.  End of operations and preservation  The era of Pr1's in passenger services came to an end in the 1960s with dieselization. The last passenger service run was in 1968. The locomotives were relegated to secondary freight duties, like gravel trains and some were moved to depots other than from Pasila. All of the locomotives were withdrawn by 1972. All were scrapped except one. Remaining number 776 was repaired for 125th anniversary of VR in 1987. It was used in heritage traffic. The boiler time expired in late 1990s. 776 is now on display at Finnish Railway Museum, but it is not in running condition.

Early life Kresz was born in Pest to Carl Kresz, a son of a fruiterer from Merseburg, who fled to Hungary to avoid impressment, and a daughter of a bookseller. He was the youngest of the six children of the couple. He studied for physician and earned his medical degree in 1871 in the University of Pest. Work Kresz first worked as a general practitioner and later became a health officer in the 5th district of Budapest. In 1876 the law for the organization of ambulance institutions was enacted, by that it became the responsibility of the police, thus the central district police stations were operating as the first ambulance stations. However, this system could not cope with the increasing number of tasks in the period of industrialization, and to be able to carry out the rescue missions, G√©za Kresz founded the Budapest Voluntary Ambulance Society (Budapesti √ñnk√©ntes Ment≈ë Egyes√ºlet, B√ñME) in 1887, utilizing the model that was used in Vienna since a few years. In the coming years he established the organized ambulance system, actively participated in the elimination of cholera and organized the supply of Budapest with breast milk.

In 1890 the Ambulance Palace (Ment≈ëpalota) - designed by Zsigmond Quittner - was erected on the proposal of Kresz. This was the first building in Europe that was built as an ambulance station and it still serves as the headquarters of the National Ambulance. The building process took one and a half years and was financed by the donations of wealthy citizens. In the yard were found the stables with hayloft and the horse-drawn ambulance coaches. Kresz also had his residence in the Ambulance Palace, where he lived with his family on the second floor. The second wing of the building was handed over in the second part of the 1890s. The bedrooms of the residential employees, the storage rooms, and the Ambulance Museum - established by Kresz - were placed here. Kresz collected and systematized the instruments and other memorabilia to create this special museum, which is still unique in Europe. As a devoted fan of ice skating, Kresz played pioneer role in popularizing the sport in Hungary. On his initiation was founded the Pest Skating Club (Pesti Korcsoly√°z√≥ Egylet) in 1869 and he set up the first skating rink, the City Park Ice Rink, on the frozen lake of the City Park. Ice skating quickly became a beloved sport, which is shown that the number of skating club members grew from 35 to 432 in the first year. Later life and legacy During the Millennial Exhibition in 1896, Kresz made an X-ray image of Franz Joseph's right hand.https://tudosnaptar.kfki.hu/k/r/kresz/kreszpant.html On 1 November 1885 he was awarded with the Order of Franz Joseph (Knight Class). For the founding of the Budapest Voluntary Ambulance Society, he earned the title royal councilor on 3 January 1897. In the 1900s a series of ambulance stations were created in Hungarian cities and villages, for them the example to follow was the Budapest Voluntary Ambulance Society. For his merits he was ennobled by Franz Joseph on 24 December 1900 and was given the name de Szeml≈ëhegy (Szeml≈ëhegyi). In his crest is seen a lion that holds the coat of arms of the National Ambulance, while on the shield are three oak leaves, symbolizing his sons, and three lilies, symbolizing his daughters. He died on 10 April 1901 and was buried in the National Graveyard in Budapest. The Ambulance Museum has been renamed in the honor of Kresz, a street in Budapest bears his name and a plaque remembers him by the Ambulance Palace. The minor planet no. 242523, discovered on 5 January 2005 is named after him. Kresz G√©za KreszG√©zau38.jpgHis memorial plaque in the street named after him.

Skinner was a right-handed batsman who bowled left-arm roundarm fast. The son of Richard Skinner, a master tailor, he was born at Steyning, Sussex. Skinner made his first-class debut for Sussex against Kent in 1873. Over the next decade he played infrequently for Sussex, making nine further first-class appearances, the last of which came against Hampshire in 1882. In his ten first-class matches, he scored 41 runs at an average of 2.56, with a high score of 10. With the ball, he took 16 wickets at a bowling average of 29.93, with best figures of 4/95. Outside of cricket he worked as a tailor, but also coached cricket at Marlborough College. At the time of the 1881 census, he was living at the Tailor's Shop in Steyning, with his father Richard, then aged 60 and his mother Jane, then aged 64. His unmarried brothers Ernest and Harry, as well as his unmarried sister Fanny were also living there. He died at the town of his birth on 17 February 1926.

The work is an oil on canvas, painted in 1820. It is held in the Minneapolis Institute of Art, Minnesota. Background In 1792, Goya developed a sudden serious illness which included dizziness, weakness, delirium, sickness, abdominal pain, deafness, and partial blindness.Foy J. L. The Deafness and Madness of Goya: Conscious and Unconscious Expressive Art. Vol 3. Basel: Karger, 1971. (Cited in M.P. Park and R.H.R. Park, \\"The Fine Art of Patient-Doctor Relationships.\\" BMJ 329 (2004): p. 1,475, and notes 1, 2.)Cawthorne, Terrance. \\"Goya's Illness.\\" Proc Roy Soc Med 55 (March 1962): 213‚Äì217. By the time he returned to Madrid, in 1793, Goya was completely deaf. Various diagnoses of this serious illness have been offered: syphilis, lead poisoning, cerebrovascular disease, acute infection of the central nervous system, and the rare condition of Vogt- Koyanagi-Harada syndrome‚Äîtemporary inflammation of the uveal tract associated with permanent deafness.Cawthorne Terrance. \\"Goya's Illness.\\" Proc Roy Soc Med 55 (March 1962): 213-217. In 1819 Goya had a second serious illness. Little information is available either on the nature of the illness or on the treatment provided by Eugenio Garc√≠a Arrieta. The painting is the main source, and an inscription (in the manner of ex-voto pictures) below the figures explains why Goya made the picture: ‚ÄúGoya, in gratitude to his friend Arrieta: for the compassion and care with which he saved his life during the acute and dangerous illness he suffered towards the end of the year 1819 in his seventy- third year.Licht, Fred. Goya--The Origins of the Modern Temper in Art. New York: Harper and Row, 1983. He painted it in 1820‚Äú. Robert Hughes writes that \\"a faint clue to the nature of Goya's malady may lie in the fact that Dr. Arrieta is known to have gone to North Africa in 1820 to study Eastern plague. Epidemics of such plagues, which included yellow fever, happened from time to time in Spain because of contagions brought by Mediterranean shipping. Since Arrieta was considered a plague specialist, Goya may have been stricken by such a virus. But this is highly speculative.\\" The work Goya is seated on his bed obviously weak from his illness. He grasps his bed-sheet as if clinging on to life and is supported from falling backwards by the arm of Arrieta. The doctor gently encourages his patient to take the medicine. Shadowy figures‚Äîperhaps his servants and a priest‚Äîin the background seem to be portents of doom. Goya may have expected to die, but under Arrieta's care, he was nursed back to health and lived another eight years. Self Portrait with Dr Arrieta is an image of hope amidst despair and the colours are correspondingly more delicate and lighter than in other works of this period.McEwan, John. John Bellany. Edinburgh and London: Mainstream Publishing, 1994. History The work was a present for Arrieta. It was painted in gratitude for the gift of life, not as a memento mori. It is uncertain how long the painting remained in Arrieta's possession. In 1820 he traveled to Africa to study bubonic plague, and it is probable that the painting remained in Spain. By 1860, when exhibited in Madrid, it was in the collection of Mr Martinez of Madrid. Later the painting was recorded in various private collections in Paris before being acquired by the Minneapolis Institute of Art. McEwan John. John Bellany.

Unofficial pride flag representing the LGBT community of IndiaIndia has a limited culture for LGBTQIA people due to widespread homophobia, stemming from colonial implementation of European law, in the modern-day populace. However living conditions and media representation have been improving in recent years, especially in terms of representation of transgender people. Sexuality in pre-modern India Throughout Hindu and Vedic texts there are many descriptions of saints, demigods, and even the Supreme Lord transcending gender norms and manifesting multiple combinations of sex and gender.Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex, p. 40 Apart from male and female, there are more than 20 types of genders, such as trans woman, trans men, androgynous, pangender and trigender etc. Transpeople were accepted in ancient India and referred to by terms like \\"tritya prakriti\\", \\"kliba\\" and \\"napunsaka\\".Suneeta Singh, Sangita Dasgupta, Pallav Patankar, Minati Sinha, p. 83 A People Stronger: The Collectivization of MSM and TG groups in India Alka Pande says that alternate sexuality was an integral part of ancient India and homosexuality was considered to be a form of the sacred, drawing upon the examples of the hermaphrodite Shikhandi and Arjuna who became a eunuch. Ruth Vanita argues that ancient India was relatively tolerant and views on it were ambiguous, from acceptance to rejection. Some Hindu texts mention homosexuality and support them. The Kamasutra mentions homosexuality as a type of sexual pleasure. There are also legends of Hindu gods change gender or are hermaphrodites and engage in relations that would be considered homoerotic in the other case.Jeffrey S. Siker, p.10, Homosexuality and Religion: An Encyclopedia Though, it also forbids the educated Brahmins, bureaucrats and wisemen from practicing Auparishtaka or oral sex.FM. Krishna Kumari, p. 151 Sermons from Stones: Contribution of Andhras to Art, Culture, and Thought Homosexuality was also practiced in the royal families especially with servants.Ruth Vanita, p. 27 Same-Sex Love in India: Readings from Literature and History Kamasutra also mentions the \\"svairini\\" who used to live by herself or with another woman.Ruth Vanita, p. 27 Encyclopedia of Love in World Religions, Volume 1 The king Bhagiratha is described as being born of sexual union of two queens of the king Dilip, however there is also a patriarchal background represented as the king left no heir and his younger wife took on the role of a man.Giti Thadani, p. 27 Encyclopedia of Love in World Religions, Volume 1 Ayoni or non-vaginal sex of all types are punishable in the Arthashastra. Homosexual acts are however treated as a smaller offence punishable by a fine while unlawful heterosexual sex have much harsher punishment. The Dharmsastras especially the later ones prescribed against non- vaginal sex like the Vashistha Dharmasutra. The YƒÅj√±avalkya Sm·πõti prescribes fines for such acts including those with other men. Manusmriti prescribes light punishments for such acts.p. 50-51, Sexual Diversity in Asia, c. 600 - 1950, edited by Raquel A.G.

In India, city hubs have helped the community gained visibility since the 1970s. Since the early 2000s, social media and online venues have played a critical role in strengthening LGBTQ+ communities and identities in these cities. The internet has created new spaces for social interaction and community formation. Social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter and Facebook have been used to create pages and posts that increase queer awareness and visibility in India. Some examples are Instagram profiles \\"Gaysifamily\\", \\"nazariyalgbt\\", and \\"lgbthistoryindia\\". The Gaysifamily website describes their mission \\"to provide a voice and a safe space to Desis from the South Asian subcontinent that identify as LGBTQ+\\". They sell and share stickers, artwork, personal stories and zines made by queer Desis. Social media platforms are also important for the development of intimate relationships between queer people in India. For example, virtual platforms such as Grindr and Planet Romeo create private yet public spaces for gay men to be \\"out\\" and find partners for hook ups as well as relationships. Class makes a big difference to who is able to access these spaces, as it seems to be the rising Indian middle class and elite who most commonly use these websites. Even before social media became a platform for queer visibility, the internet created possibilities for communication and community building in the LGBTQ+ community. Khush-list, the first mailing list for LGBT South Asians, predominantly Indians in metropolitan cities and those living abroad, was established in 1993. In 1999, LGBT-India was established on egroups, and later transitioned to yahoogroups. Such mailing lists, established well before the advent of social networking sites, continue to remain the mainstay for discussion among middle-class, English-speaking Indians, and include LGBT- India, GayBombay, Good As You (Bangalore), Pratibimb (Hyderabad), and Movenpick/Orinam (Chennai). GayBombay.org (established in late 1998) and Orinam.net (established in 2006) are among the oldest websites that function as online resources catering to a local (Mumbai and Chennai, respectively) and national readership. Dating websites provide an alternative way for meeting people; online communities also offer a safe and convenient environment for meeting gays in India. Online magazines like Pink Pages and Gaylaxy also publish regular issues.  Radio  Delhi Queer Pride poster On 11 September 2013, India's first Queer Radio channel, Qradio - Out and Proud, completely dedicated to LGBT audience was launched . With variety of talk shows, music, debates etc., the channel now runs 24 hours a day In February 2014, \\"Wonderful Things Happen\\" was founded with the objective to serve the Indian lesbian/bi women community. Film and Television Depictions Though Bollywood has gay and transsexual characters, they have been primarily ridiculed or abused. There are few positive portrayals of late like Onir's My Brother Nikhil, Reema Kagti's Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd., and Parvati Balagopalan's Rules: Pyaar Ka Superhit Formula but they have been sporadic and not mainstream. Shelly Chopra Dhar's Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga was perhaps the first mainstream explicitly lesbian romance in Bollywood history after Fire(1997). There also been a few independent films that deal with homosexuality like Sridhar Rangayan's Gulabi Aaina ‚Äì The Pink Mirror, Girlfriend (2004 film),Yours Emotionally, 68 Pages and Ashish Sawhney's Happy Hookers. The first Indian film to deal openly with homosexual relations was Fire by Indian-Canadian director Deepa Mehta. With its 1997 release in India, it stirred up a heated controversy throughout the country. In 2004 The Journey (2004 film) Malayalam feature film written, directed and produced by Ligy J. Pullappally, inspired both by her short film Uli and a true story of two lesbian lovers in the South Indian state of Kerala. Fire is explicit in stating that the main characters enter their relationship due to the failure of their heterosexual marriages, Sancharram The Journey (2004 film), the Malayalam name for the same movie, The Journey, is clearly a film about two lesbians who fall in love with each other. Recently, Bollywood has portrayed homosexual relationships in a better light, such as in Dostana, Men Not Allowed and Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga. Actors of Indian descent have played homosexual roles in foreign movies. Lisa Ray and Sheetal Sheth played gay roles opposite each other in Shamim Sarif's I Can't Think Straight and The World Unseen. Jimi Mistry played a man trying to come out to his mother in Ian Iqbal Rashid's Touch of Pink. In 2010, a Tamil film Goa, dealt with gay couples, their love and romance. In 2016, Aligarh (2016 film), was released centering on the life of a gay professor who was accused of homosexuality. The release of Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga (2019) was a landmark in LGBT representation in media. The character of Sweety played by actress Sonam Kapoor is a lesbian and is shown to be in a relationship with Kuhu (played by Regina Cassandra). The film mainly focuses on coming out to an Indian conservative family and throws light on the struggles of a young gay teenager and the insecurities they carry well into adulthood. Indian television has also begun to depict gay characters. In 2011, the popular soap opera \\"Maryada: Lekin Kab Tak?\\" (Honour: But at What Cost?) featured a plotline involving a gay couple, and was among a handful of television shows including gay characters.  Portrayal of Homosexuality in Bollywood and Indian Cinema  Bollywood and Indian cinema are not new in portraying homosexual characters on the screen; this is often done in satirical, comical, or stereotypical ways. Many contemporary Bollywood films, such as Kal Ho Naa Ho, Dostana, Kapoor And Sons, Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga and Aligarh, to name a few, either have homosexual characters or portrayals of homosexual relationships. Some scholars argue that same-sex friendship within Bollywood movies is portrayed for a \\"gay viewership\\".The use of terms such as \\"yaar\\" (friend/lover) can be seen as a way to deter from using the language of \\"homosexuality\\" or \\"gayness\\". In recent movies, there has been a move away from the portrayal of homosexuality in a satirical and comedic way, and instead of showing a more sensitive, and empathic representation of the struggles that the community has to face. Aligarh and Kapoor And Sons are two of the more recent blockbuster Bollywood movies, both released in 2016, that have made an impact on the portrayal of homosexual men in Indian media. Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga has shown that there are major strides taken in the positive portrayal of homosexuality in cinema. These movies are turning a new page for the role of homosexuality in Bollywood by challenging the previous stereotypical roles portrayed on screen. This is achieved by portraying homosexuality in a new, more truthful and complex light than has been done previously.  Indian Queer Film Festivals  Other than specific Bollywood films that showcase homosexual characters or relationships, Indian Cinema in general has been branching out; one way is through queer film festivals that are held in India. KASHISH Mumbai International Queer Film Festival is one way through which film is urging for change in the way that the Indian community views homosexuality. The festival includes films from around the world, including Indian queer films. Bangalore Queer Film Festival is another film festival that has been running since 2008. The festival showcases both Indian and international films. The festival also seeks to voice concerns and issues that the LGBT community faces. In 2017, the festival featured 55 films from 21 countries. Chennai International Queer Film Festival, also known as Reel Desires: Chennai International Queer Film Festival, is a three-day event that usually takes places on the last weekend of July. It main organisers are Orinam in partnership with Goethe-Institut, Chennai along with volunteers from various community groups and NGOs, including Nirangal, East-West Center for Counselling, RIOV, and SAATHII. They screen short films as well as Feature-length films from all over the world. The last day is usually performances along with a panel discussion, usually to discuss and bring out the challenges faced by community members. In 2014, the event had a photography exhibition, featuring queer/trans photography Shilpa Raj. Calcutta International LGBT Film & Video Festival, also known as DIALOGUES: Calcutta International LGBT Film & Video Festival, was first launched in 2007. It's a three-day festival that happens in the November each year. This Film Festival was started by 'Sappho For Equality' and 'Pratyay Gender Trust', along with Goethe-Institut /Max Mueller Bhavan, Kolkata. Delhi International Queer Theater and Film Festival is organised in Delhi by Harmless Hugs. There has been three consistent editions of this festival since 2015.  Celebrity Support to Decriminalize Homosexuality  Celebrities, represented in the general Indian media, have voiced their opinions and have advocated for the LGBTQ community in the country. After the 2013 Supreme Court Decision to reinstate S.377, the court agreed to refer the decision to a five- judge constitutional bench based on a curative petition. Many celebrities, have voiced their support for the curative petition and the decriminalization of homosexuality, by repealing S.377. A news article by Akshay Kaushal in the Hindustan Times (3 Feb. 2016), outlines some of these public comments; this includes: Onir, one of the few openly gay film directors who stated, \\"Now hopefully the five-judge constitution bench will take the decision in our favour. And this law should have been scrapped the day the Britishers left India. So hopefully, the 2009 verdict of the Delhi Court, that decriminalized gay sex among consenting adults, will be back soon.\\" Delhi-based fashion designer, who married his partner Rahul Arora stated, \\"I am hopeful and positive that the five-judge constitution bench will scrap section 377 and make this country a better place for us to live\\". National Award-winning filmmaker Apurva Asrani, who wrote the film Aligarh, when referring to the five-judge constitutional bench stated, \\"the Supreme Court has allowed itself a chance to redeem itself from a blemish on its otherwise spotless image.\\" \\"This (homosexuality) has been accepted even in our Hindu scriptures. I stand by my gay friends\\" said Actor Raveena Tandon. \\"Today‚Äôs decision is a great step. However, I think a disparity that can easily be addressed by amending the Indian Penal Code shouldn‚Äôt have to be a 15-year-long struggle\\" said actor and gay rights activist Celina Jaitley. Along with the curative petition, submitted by NGOs, to the Supreme Court of India, leading to the five-judge constitutional bench to re-consider the repeal of section 377, a petition was filed by five gay celebrities. The petition was covered by various news articles, including The Times of India, stating, \\"The petitioners are lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGBT) citizens of India whose rights to sexuality, sexual autonomy, choice of sexual partner, life, privacy, dignity and equality, along with the other fundamental rights guaranteed under Part-III of Constitution, are violated by Section 377.\\" This is the first time those that are directly effected by the 2013 decision have addressed the court in his manner. The petitioners are, NS Johar (dancer), Sunil Mehra (journalist), Ritu Dalmia (chef), Aman Nath (hotelier), and Ayesha Kapoor (business executive).The petition was not reviewed or added by the Supreme Court; stating that there are already petitions of the same nature that the court is reviewing at the moment, and advised the celebrities to wait till the decision is out before further pursuing this issue. In 2019, Nartaki Natraj became the first transperson to receive the prestigious Padma Shri. Events Gay Pride March in Bangalore (2013) While the discussion on homosexuality is happening in India, the below pride parades have been established in various major cities of India: * Bengaluru Pride (2008) *Chennai Queer LitFest (2018) *Chennai Rainbow Pride (2009) * Chennai Rainbow Film Festival (2013) * Bhubaneswar Pride (2009) * Hyderabad Pride (2013) * Chandigarh Pride (2013) * Delhi Queer Pride Parade (2008) * Mumbai Queer Azaadi March (2008) * Kolkata Rainbow Pride Walk (1999) - This is the first pride march to be organised in South Asia, that was organised by members of the support group Counsel Club, and witnessed participants walking down the streets of Kolkata starting from Park Circus Maidan. * Pune Pride (2011, second to be established in Maharashtra) * Ahmedabad Pride Parade (2009) * Kerala Queer Pride (2010) * Asia's first Genderqueer pride parade and Alan Turing Rainbow festival, Madurai (2012) * Bhawanipatna Pride (2012) * Guwahati Queer Pride Parade (2014) * Cochin Queer Pride (2014) * Queer Gulabi Pride Jaipur (2015) *Dehradun Pride Parade (2017) * First Gujarat state LGBT pride parade in Surat (2013) * Baroda (2014) * Kerala Queer Pride 2015 at Thiruvananthapuram * Orange City LGBT Pride March, Nagpur (2016) *Lucknow (9 April 2017)- Awadh Pride was the first such event to take place in the state of Uttar Pradesh *Bhopal Pride (2017) - the first Pride event to take place in the state of Madhya Pradesh *Jamshedpur LGBTQ Pride (2018) *Pride De Goa (2017) * Amritsar Pride Parade (2019) A tradition in Indian pride parades is the wearing of colorful masks for the partial purpose of hiding the wearers' identities from public view and avoiding altercations with family members. This is expected to change as less reprisals are feared from the general public, as shown with the inaugural Pune Pride Parade in December 2011, which required participants to dress professionally and avoid wearing masks or colorful makeup. Participants in the parades hail from various indigenous gender and sexual minority groups and infuse the largely-Western-derived aesthetic of pride with local and national cultural trappings. Western and international tourists also participate in pride celebrations in India. The Free Hugs Campaigning conducted in Kochi (Ernakulam) and TVM in Kerala. In Nagpur, Maharashtra, an annual LGBT Pride Carnival is conducted as a part of Pride Month celebrations, since 2018 Groups and NGOs Groups of various kinds and NGOs (non-governmental organizations also known as non-profit organizations) have long been a bedrock for queer and lgbtqia+ culture in India. Queer/lgbtqia+ groups in India come in many forms and operate under various organizational structures: some are social and/or support groups with several regulars who act as conveners and may help provide structure by, for example, setting conversation topics for each week's meeting; other groups identify specifically as \\"collectives\\" perhaps to reflect certain aspects of their organization or particular socio- political commitments such as to shared work; still other groups are more freewheeling, and, while they congregate under a group name, do not seem to have a designated leader, though there are members who are \\"moderators\\" of the group's Facebook group. The language that groups and individual members use to talk about and label genders and sexualities also varies. Some prefer lgbt, lgbtqia+, or a similar acronym, while others prefer queer, which some see as linked to a politics of intersectionality and/or inclusion, and some use lgbtqia+ and queer interchangeably. To acknowledge each position, this section uses both simultaneously, joined by either \\"and\\" or a slash. When it is clear that a group or individual prefers a specific term, that language will be used. Such groups and NGO spaces provided‚Äîand still provide‚Äîindispensable social spaces for queer/lgbtqia+ people, perhaps because, at least until quite recently, other publicly accessible social or meeting spaces geared towards queer/lgbtqia+ people (such as bars) did not exist. Some bars and cafes are more frequently known to be \\"queer friendly\\" rather than catering specifically‚Äîif not almost exclusively‚Äîto queer/lgbtqia+ people in the way that gay bars are in some other countries; several such examples are Kitty Su, the LaLit hotel chain's swanky night club chain, and Q Caf√© in New Delhi, which recently closed down in 2019. Some queer/lgbtqia+ groups follow a nomadic style, meeting periodically at different coffee shops, restaurants, book shops, and similar public areas. Others have a fixed meeting spot‚Äîoften the offices of an NGO. Public visibility and understanding of queerness and lgbtqia+ experiences is increasing rapidly in India‚Äîparticularly during and after the more recent Delhi High Court (2009) and India Supreme Court rulings (2013 and 2018) that toggled back and forth the legality of IPC (Indian Penal Code) section 377. The Supreme Court's final ruling, in September 2018, read down section 377 to legalize, between consenting adults, what is generally referred to as \\"homosexual sex\\"‚Äîalthough the precise wording of section 377 outlawed \\"anal intercourse against the order of nature.\\" Nonetheless, queer and lgbtqia+ groups remain an indispensable central axis of queer sociality‚Äîalongside several secret and/or private Facebook groups, some of which correspond to social and support groups that periodically meet in the physical world (or IRL‚Äîin real life‚Äîto use internet terminology). The sections below list, and provide information about, queer and lgbtqia+ groups, businesses, and notable figures. These lists are not intended to be comprehensive, and at the end of each section is a list of additional queer and lgbtqia+ groups around India. The section concerning groups includes several that are now defunct but whose contribution to lgbtqia+ culture in India is significant as the groups shaped the lgbtqia+ community while they existed‚Äîand after.  Groups, formal and informal (in alphabetical order)  = Alternative Law Forum = The Alternative Law Forum (ALF) in Bangalore, Karnataka (South India) is an organization that \\"integrates alternative lawyering with critical research, alternative dispute resolution,\\" and additional education and community engagement on a range of issues. Frequently referred to as ALF, the Alternative Law Forum is known across India. ALF's motto, \\"lawyering for change,\\" succinctly captures the organization's philosophy and body of work. A group of lawyers who desired a forum in which to conduct legal work grounded in social justice concerns founded ALF in 2000, ALF is regularly involved in assisting individuals who run afoul of potentially corrupt or discriminatory police, such as transgender and queer people.

Originally known as Women to Women, the group then became Stree Sangam‚Äîmeaning \\"confluence of women\\" ‚Äîa name which would not stand out as particularly queer for those affiliated with the group yet hoping to remain discrete. Stree Sangam later took on a new and more overt name, Lesbian and Bisexuals in Action, or LABIA for short.

Voices Against 377 was an intervenor in the Delhi High Court and India Supreme Court cases against IPC 377‚Äîthat is, they were a party in the case, though not the original plaintiff. In 2006, Voices Against 377 added its name in support of a petition filed by the Naz Foundation against IPC 377 after the India Supreme Court had reinstated the case to be heard by the Delhi High Court following the Delhi High Court's 2004 dismissal of the case on the basis that the issue was speculative rather than practical‚Äîthat is, that there was \\"no cause of action\\" because the plaintiff, the NGO Naz Foundation, failed to demonstrate that prosecutions resulted from IPC 377. A fundamental right to \\"dignity\\" possessed by all, including LGBT people, was central to the filing that Voices contributed to the court case. Mr. Shyam Divan was the council representing Voices Against 377 when the case was heard in the Delhi High Court. Pride Circle Pride Circle is a \\"hiring consultancy firm\\" geared towards LGBTQIA+ people in India based in Bangalore in South India.

The colonial era building is famous as a haunted house, though the Semarang city government has attempted to rebrand it. Etymology The name Lawang Sewu is from Javanese; it means \\"Thousand Doors\\". The name comes from its design, with numerous doors and arcs. The building has about 600 large windows. Layout Blueprints for Building B The complex consists of several buildings, two main ones named A and B and two smaller ones named C and D, on Pemuda Street. The l-shaped A building faces the Tugu Muda roundabout. There are two identical towers on A building, which were originally used to store water, each with a capacity of . The building features large stained-glass windows and a grand staircase in the center. There was also once a tunnel connecting A building to several other sites in the city, including the governor's mansion and the harbour. The B building is located behind A building. It is three stories in height, with the first two floors consisting of offices and the third holding a ballroom. The building, with high, large windows, also has a basement floor that is kept partially flooded to serve to cool the building through evaporation. In front of A building stands a monument to five employees killed during the Indonesian War of Independence. History \\"A Building\\" in the early 1900s A side hall of the building Lawang Sewu was designed by Cosman Citroen, from the firm of J.F. Klinkhamer and B.J. Quendag. It was designed in New Indies Style, an academically-accepted term for Dutch Rationalism in the Indies. Similar with Dutch Rationalism, the style is the result of the attempt to develop new solutions to integrate traditional precedents (classicism) with new technological possibilities. It can be described as a transitional style between Traditionalists and the Modernists, and was strongly influenced by the design of Berlage. Construction began in 1904 with A building, which was completed in 1907. The rest of the complex was finished in 1919. It was initially used by the Nederlandsch-Indische Spoorweg Maatschappij, the first railway company in the Dutch East Indies. After the Japanese invaded Indonesia in 1942, the Japanese army took over Lawang Sewu. The basement of B building was turned into a prison, with several torture and executions taking place there. When Semarang was retaken by the Dutch in the battle of Semarang in October 1945, the Dutch forces used the tunnel leading into A building to sneak into the city. A battle ensued, with numerous Indonesian fighters dying. Five employees working there were also killed. After the war, the Indonesian army took over the complex. It was later returned to the national railway company. In 1992 it was declared a Cultural Property of Indonesia. By 2009 the Lawang Sewu complex was in a state of considerable dilapidation. Simon Marcus Gower, writing in The Jakarta Post, noted it as being \\"dark and evidently sick. Its white walls are faded throughout; blackened by pollution and neglect. Rendered walls are cracked and any wall paper has long since fallen away to reveal the red bricks beneath. Mould and weeds grow over much of the building and mice and rats are the chief residents.\\" The building soon underwent renovations to ensure that it would be profitable as a tourist attraction. Governor of Central Java Bibit Waluyo mobilized several dozen soldiers to assist with the renovations; the soldiers focused on external repairs. Local residents were disappointed in the renovations, opining that it had lost its authenticity. On 5 July 2011 the newly renovated complex was inaugurated by First Lady Ani Yudhoyono. However, at the time only B building was available for tours. It is hoped to be a main attraction in the Central Javan government's tourism program in 2013. Future plans include transforming Building B into office space, a food court, and even a gym. In late 2013 the Semarang city government announced plans to eliminate the building's \\"spooky image\\" in order to attract more visitors. This was to encompass a reimagining of the site as a place for social and cultural activities, supported by renovations of the building. At the time, Lawang Sewu attracted an average of 1,000 visitors daily. Urban legend The basement of B building, said to be haunted by a kuntilanak An access to the underground of Lawang Sewu building in Semarang, Central Java, Indonesia Lawang Sewu is said to be abandoned and supposedly haunted place, where many tourists wander visiting to see the ghosts.. Among the ghosts reported to inhabit the establishment are a singular Dutchwoman A vengeful wraith of lady who committed suicide in the building itself and \\"headless ghouls\\" In 2007, a horror film entitled Lawang Sewu: Dendam Kuntilanak (Lawang Sewu: Kuntilanak's Vengeance) was released plot-based on the legend. It told the story of a group of high school students from Jakarta who were trapped in Lawang Sewu after several had to urinate and featured ghosts of a Dutchwoman, a man with a ball and chain wrapped around his leg, and a kuntilanak. The place is still now a mystery around, circulating the landmark that were never stay in the building.

The line opened in 1856 and was well used in the period down to 1914. Road transport from about 1923 became a serious competitor and the usage of the line declined steeply. Economy measures did little to retrieve the situation and the passenger service was withdrawn in 1951. Goods traffic continued for a period, but in 1964 that too was withdrawn. There is no railway use of the line now. History The Selkirk and Galashiels Railway Over many centuries the towns in the Borders had developed skills in manufacturing high-quality woollen goods, deriving originally from the abundant fellside grassland and equally abundant pure water. The intrinsic disadvantage of their location was the difficulty and expense of transporting the finished products to the market. The North British Railway obtained Parliamentary authorisation for its mainline from Edinburgh to Berwick in 1844 and opened that line in 1846. Already in 1845 with the first line under construction, the North British was planning a long branch line to Hawick, and it obtained an Act for the purpose. The NBR's purpose was to secure as much territory for itself as possible, and to connect beyond to Carlisle, giving access to the emerging West Coast route from London as well as the East Coast. At first, this strategic objective was not advertised, and in any case Hawick as a major wool making town was a valid destination. On 9 February 1846 the North British Railway held a shareholders' meeting at which approval was given for the NBR to construct a branch line to Selkirk, but this was never carried into effect; by October 1847 shareholder discomfort with the extent of financial commitments being taken on, had reached an unbearable level.David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, The Hawick line and its extension to Carlisle became the Waverley Route, and its completion encouraged ideas of connecting other Borders towns by branch lines or otherwise. Hawick was reached on 1 November 1849, and the line passed through Galashiels. Selkirk lay about from Galashiels, and as well as woollen goods it had an important shoemaking industry. The independent Selkirk and Galashiels Railway was incorporated on 31 July 1854, with authorised capital of ¬£24,000.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 The promoters secured agreement with the North British Railway that the NBR would work the line; the terms were for 50% of receipts up to ¬£3,000 a year and 45% above that.Christopher Awdry, The Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Ltd, Sparkford, 1990, John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 1, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, Subscriptions for shares had to be secured, and work on building the line did not start until the following year. Captain Tyler, Inspecting Officer of the Board of Trade, visited the line on 3 April 1856. He approved the line for passenger operation, but he was critical of the poor quality of the line: he reported that, \\"The permanent way is of a light description and the joints of the rails are not fished. The gradients are severe and the curves sharp, and altogether the line is not fitted for heavy traffic or for high speeds.\\" Moreover, the junction on the main line near Galashiels was protected by distant signals only, and they were too close to the junction, giving inadequate stopping distance for approaching trains: there were no stop signals at all. The Company agreed to make urgent changes and Tyler agreed to the line opening on the proviso of one engine in steam operation, and the use of tank engines only, as there was no turntable at the terminus.Alistair Nisbet, Willie Gow and the Selkirk Branch, Backtrack Magazine, September 2010, Pendragon Publishing, Easingwold A local newspaper had a more benevolent view of the inspection: > Selkirk Railway: The Government inspector went over the line on Thursday [3 > April 1856], examining it carefully. He has expressed his entire > satisfaction with the works and given a most favourable report. The line > will be open to passengers on Saturday first. It is a single line of rails, > and its route passes along the banks of the Gala, the Tweed, and the > Ettrick, generally skirting the sides of those beautiful haughs which lie in > its path. The length of the line is .Edinburgh Evening Courant - Tuesday 08 > April 1856 reprinted from the Border Advertiser. The line duly opened on 5 April 1856; it had stations at Abbotsford Ferry, Lindean and Selkirk. The normal train service was four trains a day, six days a week, and the line was worked by the North British Railway.John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, Abbotsford Ferry station was at a location called Boldside (actually a country house of that name) and the station may have been known as Boldside at first. The ferry was a rowing boat, which the company hoped would encourage visitors use the station to come to Abbotsford House, the former home of Walter Scott. An advertisement in 1871 announced a public roup at Fairnalee, which was \\"about from the Boldside station of the Edinburgh and Hawick Railway\\",Selkirkshire: Extensive Sale of Wood in The Berwick Advertiser: 3 February 1871 but this may reflect the advertiser's colloquial usage rather than any official name. Three months after the line opened, the running of trains on Sundays was proposed. This produced a storm of protest: > The directors of the Selkirk and Galashiels Railway having at their last > meeting passed a resolution to open the line [on Sundays] for the conveyance > of mail bags and passengers, a large and enthusiastic meeting was held on > the evening of Tuesday [24 June 1856]... for the purpose of entering their > protest at the proposed violation of the Sabbath.Kelso Chronicle: 27 June > 1856 However the NBR, the driving force in the matter, persisted and the Sunday trains ran. The North British Railway absorbed the Selkirk Company on 1 July 1859.According to Nisbet; Awdry, and also Thomas, say 21 July 1859; the discrepancy may be explained by an authorising Act of Parliament and the practical adoption date being separated by a few weeks. Carter says \\"by Act of 12 July 1859.\\" The light construction of the line had not been confined to the permanent way, and in 1868 the North British Railway found that it needed to reconstruct the timber bridge over the River Tweed with iron girders on stone piers, at a cost of over ¬£6,000. The number of passenger trains on the branch was increased to six by 1863 and to 13 by 1887. The Sunday trains were withdrawn in 1916 due to manpower shortages in World War I, and they were never reinstated. From 1923 the North British Railway formed a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) following the Railways Act 1921, and the Selkitk and Galashiels company, only in existence to receive the NBR's rental charge, was absorbed into the LNER. In this period motor bus services began to erode passenger carryings on the line. Closure of the railway passenger service was contemplated by the LNER in 1930, but was not proceeded with, but Abbotsford Ferry station was closed from 5 January 1931. Seeking economy of working, the LNER introduced a Sentinel steam railcar on the branch from 5 January 1931; the vehicle operated all normal passenger trains. The railcar named Protector was in use from February 1931, and from December 1933 Nettle took over, continuing until August 1945 when the Sentinel railcars were taken out of service, and steam trains took over once again. Goods traffic too was in decline from about 1924 due to the competition from motor lorries. British Railways, Scottish Region, took over the railways in the area at the beginning of 1948, on the nationalisation of the railways. At this time the passenger traffic was in serious decline, with only about 14 tickets being issued daily on the branch. In May 1951, British Railways proposed closure of the passenger service on the line, and with no objection being put forward, it was decided to close the passenger service on 10 September 1951. Some works outing special trains ran from Selkirk after closure until at least 1957. The station remained open for goods traffic, but that too was in decline; a review in November 1958 considered withdrawal, but for the time being the line continued in use, but on 2 November 1964 all public goods facilities were withdrawn; a private siding at Selkirk remained in use for a short time after that date. A short section of the branch at Galashiels was retained to cross the Gala Water to serve the gas works, but that too closed in October 1966, and the line was completely closed. Topography The line left the Galashiels to Hawick line, turning south immediately before the Tweed Bridge, crossing the Gala Water, and following the west bank of the river Tweed, past Abbotsford Ferry station. The line continued south, crossing the Tweed to the east bank immediately north of the confluence of the Ettrick Water, and followed close to the east bank of that river to Lindean station, at Ettrick Bridge.

Since large producers moved into the region in the 1980s and local producer successes at wine competitions in the 2010s spurred further development, Ningxia has become one of the premier wine regions in China. History Wine grapes have been grown in the area since 1982, when large Chinese wine producers such as Changyu and Great Wall established vineyards in the region. At that time, little wine was vinified in the region; rather, the grapes were shipped to more developed regions to be turned into wine. In the late 1990s, the Ningxia Agricultural Reclamation Management Bureau began a concerted effort to turn once arid land between the Yellow River and the Helan Mountain foothills into a potential site for vineyard development. From the mid 2000s onwards, Ningxia saw a steady increase in quality wine production, with international wine brands such as Pernod Ricard and LVMH investing in the area. Several boutique, Chinese-owned wineries also began operations in this period, including Helan Qingxue Winery and Silver Heights Vineyard. In London in September 2011, the Decanter Red Bordeaux Varietal Over ¬£10 International Trophy went to a 2009 Bordeaux blend from Ningxia province called Jiabeilan from Helan Qingxue winery. The same winery also won a silver medal for its Classic Chardonnay 2008 and a bronze for its Premium Collection Riesling.Adam Lechmere, \\"Chinese wine wins top honour at Decanter World Wine Awards\\", Decanter.com, 8 September 2011.

Following Helan Qingxue's surprise win at the Decanter Worldwide Wine Awards in 2011, Ningxia has seen an explosion of winery development. One unique viticultural feature of the region is the use of sand and earth to bury the vines in the winter, a labor-intensive practice necessary to protect the vines against the cold and dry months from November through March. On 14 December 2011 in Beijing, in a competition tagged \\"Bordeaux against Ningxia\\", experts from China and France tasted five wines from each region. Ningxia was the clear winner with four out of five of the top wines.Laurie Burkitt, \\"Ningxia Beats Bordeaux. Or Does It?\\", The Wall Street Journal, 15 December 2011. Retrieved 16 December 2011.

Retrieved 16 December 2011. Plans for expansion In the 21st century, Chinese authorities gave approval to the development of the eastern base of the Helan Mountains in Ningxia Hui autonomous region as an area for wine production. Several large Chinese wine companies including Changyu and Dynasty Wine have begun development in the western region of the province. Together they own 20,000 acres of land for wine plantations, while Dynasty has invested 100 million yuan into Ningxia. In addition, the major oil company China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation has founded a grape plantation near the Helan Mountains. The household appliance company Midea has also begun participating in Ningxia's wine industry.\\"Grape expansion: Chinese wine companies move west\\" , Want China Times, 15 December 2011. Retrieved 17 December 2011. Since the early 2010s, winemaking in Ningxia has grown quickly in size and reputation. The area of land with planted vines in Ningxia increased from 2,660 hectares in 2004 to 39,300 hectares in 2014. As of late 2016, Ningxia has 100 operational wineries with 80 more under construction and 50 further in the planning stages. According to data from British consulting firm International Wine and Spirit Research, China's wine consumption has doubled over the past five years and is currently the world's seventh-largest consumer in terms of volume. It is expected to become the world's top wine consumer within the next 20 years.

The initial construction of the Ontonagon piers was carried out during 1868-1872 The inner 1069 feet of the west pier, constructed of wood pilings filled with stone, dates from this time. Over the next 20 years, another 1770 feet of the east pier and 1398 feet of the west pier was constructed, and a pierhead light was installed on the west pier. In addition, the inner 545 ft of the east pier was reconstructed; all of these pier structures were of rock-filler timber cribs. In the 1920 and 1930s, a stone superstructure was built over sections of both piers, and a concrete cap was constructed on the inner 1,069 feet of the west pier. In 1947, the west pierhead was rebuilt, and in 1883 various structural improvements were made. Description The shipping channel between the piers is 150 feet wide and 15‚Äì17 feet deep.

A., \\"Why gold nanoparticles are more precious than pretty gold: Noble metal surface plasmon resonance and its enhancement of the radiative and nonradiative properties of nanocrystals of different shapes\\", Chemical Society Reviews, vol. 35, pp. 209-217, 2006. --via Semantic Scholar What differentiates these particles from normal surface plasmons is that plasmonic nanoparticles also exhibit interesting scattering, absorbance, and coupling properties based on their geometries and relative positions. These unique properties have made them a focus of research in many applications including solar cells, spectroscopy, signal enhancement for imaging, and cancer treatment. Their high sensitivity also identifies them as good candidates for designing mechano-optical instrumentation. Plasmons are the oscillations of free electrons that are the consequence of the formation of a dipole in the material due to electromagnetic waves. The electrons migrate in the material to restore its initial state; however, the light waves oscillate, leading to a constant shift in the dipole that forces the electrons to oscillate at the same frequency as the light. This coupling only occurs when the frequency of the light is equal to or less than the plasma frequency and is greatest at the plasma frequency that is therefore called the resonant frequency. The scattering and absorbance cross-sections describe the intensity of a given frequency to be scattered or absorbed. Many fabrication processes or chemical synthesis methods exist for preparation of such nanoparticles, depending on the desired size and geometry. The nanoparticles can form clusters (the so- called \\"plasmonic molecules\\") and interact with each other to form cluster states. The symmetry of the nanoparticles and the distribution of the electrons within them can affect a type of bonding or antibonding character between the nanoparticles similarly to molecular orbitals. Since light couples with the electrons, polarized light can be used to control the distribution of the electrons and alter the mulliken term symbol for the irreducible representation. Changing the geometry of the nanoparticles can be used to manipulate the optical activity and properties of the system, but so can the polarized light by lowering the symmetry of the conductive electrons inside the particles and changing the dipole moment of the cluster. These clusters can be used to manipulate light on the nano scale.  Theory  The quasistatic equations that describe the scattering and absorbance cross- sections for very small spherical nanoparticles are: {{\\\\sigma }_{\\\\rm scatt}}=\\\\frac{8\\\\pi }{3}{{k}^{4}}{{R}^{6}}{{\\\\left \\\\frac{{{\\\\varepsilon }_{\\\\rm particle}}-{{\\\\varepsilon }_{\\\\rm medium}}}{{{\\\\varepsilon }_{\\\\rm particle}}+2{{\\\\varepsilon }_{\\\\rm medium}}} \\\\right}^{2}} {{\\\\sigma }_{\\\\rm abs}}=4\\\\pi k{{R}^{3}}\\\\operatorname{Im}\\\\left \\\\frac{{{\\\\varepsilon }_{\\\\rm particle}}-{{\\\\varepsilon }_{\\\\rm medium}}}{{{\\\\varepsilon }_{\\\\rm particle}}+2{{\\\\varepsilon }_{\\\\rm medium}}} \\\\right where k is the wavenumber of the electric field, R is the radius of the particle, {{\\\\varepsilon }_{\\\\rm medium}} is the relative permittivity of the dielectric medium and {{\\\\varepsilon }_{\\\\rm particle}} is the relative permittivity of the nanoparticle defined by {{\\\\varepsilon }_{\\\\rm particle}}=1-\\\\frac{\\\\omega _{\\\\rm p}^{2}}{{{\\\\omega }^{2}} + \\\\mathrm{i}{\\\\omega}{\\\\gamma}} also known as the Drude Model for free electrons where {{\\\\omega }_{\\\\rm p}} is the plasma frequency, {\\\\gamma} is the relaxation frequency of the charge carries, and \\\\omega is the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation. This equation is the result of solving the differential equation for a harmonic oscillator with a driving force proportional to the electric field that the particle is subjected to. For a more thorough derivation, see surface plasmon. It logically follows that the resonance conditions for these equations is reached when the denominator is around zero such that {{\\\\varepsilon }_{\\\\rm particle}}+2{{\\\\varepsilon }_{\\\\rm medium}}\\\\approx 0 When this condition is fulfilled the cross-sections are at their maximum. These cross-sections are for single, spherical particles. The equations change when particles are non-spherical, or are coupled to 1 or more other nanoparticles, such as when their geometry changes. This principle is important for several applications. Rigorous electrodynamic analysis of plasma oscillations in a spherical metal nanoparticle of a finite size was performed in Belyaev B.A. and Tyurnev, V.V. \\"Resonances of Electromagnetic Oscillations in a Spherical Metal Nanoparticle,\\" Microwave and Optical Technology Letters, 2016, Vol. 58, No 8, p. 1883. .  Applications   Plasmonic solar cells  Due to their ability to scatter light back into the photovoltaic structure and low absorption, plasmonic nanoparticles are under investigation as a method for increasing solar cell efficiency. Forcing more light to be absorbed by the dielectric increases efficiency.Ferry, V. E., Munday, J. N., Atwater, H. A. \\" Design Considerations for Plasmonic Photovoltaics,\\" Advanced Materials, vol. 22, Sept 2010. Plasmons can be excited by optical radiation and induce an electric current from hot electrons in materials fabricated from gold particles and light-sensitive molecules of porphin, of precise sizes and specific patterns. The wavelength to which the plasmon responds is a function of the size and spacing of the particles. The material is fabricated using ferroelectric nanolithography. Compared to conventional photoexcitation, the material produced three to 10 times the current.  Spectroscopy  In the past 5 years plasmonic nanoparticles have been explored as a method for high resolution spectroscopy. One group utilized 40 nm gold nanoparticles that had been functionalized such that they would bind specifically to epidermal growth factor receptors to determine the density of those receptors on a cell. This technique relies on the fact that the effective geometry of the particles change when they appear within one particle diameter (40 nm) of each other. Within that range, quantitative information on the EGFR density in the cell membrane can be retrieved based on the shift in resonant frequency of the plasmonic particles.Wang, J., Boriskina, S. V., Wang, H., Reinhard, B. M. \\"Illuminating Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Densities on Filopodia through Plasmon Coupling,\\" ACS Nano, vol. 5, pp. 6619-6628, 2011.  Cancer treatment  Preliminary research indicates that the absorption of gold nanorods functionalized with epidermal growth factor is enough to amplify the effects of low power laser light such that it can be used for targeted radiation treatments.Rejiya, C.S., Kumar, J., Raji, V., Vibin, M., Abraham, A. \\"Laser Immunotherapy with Gold Nanorods Causes Selective Killing of Tumour Cells,\\" Pharmacological Research, 2011.

A Lesbian-Gay Cultural Week has been held annually since 1982 in Mexico City with the support of a cultural museum belonging to the prestigious National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) since 1987.Jim√©nez, De la Garza and Glockner, p. 14. Cinema Exaggeratedly effeminate men representations date as far back as 1938 in the Mexican film La casa del ogro (\\"The Ogre's House\\") and continued to appear solely for comedic relief.\\"El humor en el cine\\" (interview with Ricardo Guzm√°n Wolffer a Rafael Avi√±a) in La Jornada Semanal, 19 February 2006, accessed 2 December 2007. An example is the film Fin de la fiesta (1972), in which Do√±a Beatriz, the mother (played by Sara Garc√≠a), kills her gay son with sticks. The first sympathetic portrayal of a gay character awaited \\"El lugar sin l√≠mites\\" (\\"The Place Without Limits\\"), a 1978 drama directed by Arturo Ripstein and based on the novel by Chilean Jos√© Donoso.\\"El lugar sin l√≠mites\\" , in Cine Club Cine Mexicano, accessed 2 December 2007. Played by Roberto Cobo, the character of La Manuela emerges as a tragic figure who is at once desired and victimized by the typically macho characters in a Mexican village. A few years later, Do√±a Herlinda y su hijo (\\"Do√±a Herlinda and Her Son\\"; 1984)Fabi√°n de la Cruz Polanco (2006): \\"Los hijos homoer√≥ticos de Jaime Humberto Hermosillo ¬´salen del cl√≥set¬ª y se presentan en edici√≥n bibliogr√°fica\\" , in Filmweb, 1 February 2006, accessed 2 December 2007. featured the first same-sex couple in Mexican cinema, who struggled with family pressures to survive. Films like Danz√≥n (1991), by Mar√≠a Novaro; Miroslava (1993), by Alejandro Pelayo; El callej√≥n de los milagros (\\"The Alley of Miracles\\"; 1995), by Jorge Fons; or Y tu mam√° tambi√©n (\\"And Your Mother, Too\\"; 2001), by Alfonso Cuar√≥n, incorporate homoerotic subject matter as a secondary matter in their plots or in a hidden way.The technical specifications of these films can be found in Cine Club Cine Mexicano , a database specialized in Mexican cinema by the Institute of Technology and Higher Education de Monterrey. By the 1990s and early 2000s, \\"El callej√≥n de los milagros\\" and Y tu mam√° tambi√©n dealt with gay issues and were internationally successful. The 2004 film Temporada de patos (\\"Season of Ducks\\") featured a teenage boy who discovers his homosexuality. Jaime Humberto Hermosillo, an openly gay film director, is known for his contributions to Mexican cinema. Hermosillo directed critically acclaimed films Mil nubes de paz cercan el cielo (A Thousand Clouds of Peace; 2003) and El cielo dividido (Broken Sky; 2006) allow viewers to observe relationships through the lens of gay desire. None of the film's characters approached the homosexual stereotypes that appeared in Mexican film for decades.\\"Mil nubes de paz cercan el cielo, amor, jam√°s acabar√°s de ser amor \\", interview with Juli√°n Hern√°ndez, in Golem Producciones, accessed 2 December 2007. In 2006, the same director shot another film with gay characters, Broken Sky, which chronicles the tensions in a young couple because of infidelity. In early 2006, Mexico's first-ever International Gay Film Festival took place in Mexico City and was attended by more than 5,000 movie-goers. According to its director, Alberto Legorreta, the event was born of a desire \\"to create spaces for dialogue, contemplation, and artistic criticism of gay subject matter in Mexico.\\" Television Two private channels compete in providing national coverage, Televisa and TV Azteca. Matters of sexuality are presented occasionally, mainly on talk shows and journalistic programs. Mexican networks have a strong self-censoring attitude, and therefore homosexuality is usually not dealt with unless the program deals with HIV/AIDS.Donald James West and Richard Green. Sociolegal control of homosexuality: a multi-nation comparison. p. 91. Springer, 1997. . Notwithstanding, in recent years it is now relatively common to include gay characters on Mexican sitcoms and soap operas. A lesbian character was the first to be included in a popular 1990s soap opera, Nada personal (\\"Nothing Personal\\"). In this TV Azteca-produced program, the positive image of homosexuality goes along with a major criticism of the Mexican political system.Haggerty, p. 590. In 1999, another TV Azteca production, La vida en el espejo (\\"Life in the Mirror\\"), showed Jos√© Mar√≠a Yazpik playing a gay character, which was recognized by many critics as the first gay character portrayed with dignity in a Mexican soap opera. The same network produced similar gay characters played by actress Margarita Gralia in Mirada de Mujer (1997), actor Juan Pablo Medina in Cuando seas m√≠a (\\"When You Would Be Mine\\"; 2001) and actor Juan Manuel Bernal in La heredera (\\"The Heiress\\"; 2004). In mid-2009, Televisa-produced soap opera Sortilegio softly dealt with bisexuality. A couple months later, Los exitosos P√©rez (\\"The Successful P√©rezes\\"), an adaptation of Argentine comedy-drama soap opera Los exitosos Pells (\\"The Successful Pellses\\"), was launched in Mexico. The TV show revolves around whether homosexuals should come out of the closet or not. Actor and protagonist Jaime Camil criticized Mexican television for censoring his kissing scenes with male co-star Jos√© Ron. Cable television shows tend to be more open when dealing with LGBT issues. Aside from American TV shows, such as sitcom Will & Grace, drama series The L Word, drama series Six Feet Under, reality Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, and several MTV productions, Televisa- affiliated music videos network Telehit has continuously produced TV shows targeting the LGBT community since the early 2000s. Desde Gayola, broadcast from 2001 to 2006, was a Mexican sketch comedy TV series that criticized the reality on the Mexican society, dealing with diverse topics such as politics, religion, sexuality, and show business, among others. Produced by Horacio Villalobos, Desde Gayola featured many LGBT characters, including Manig√ºis (Carlos Rangel), a stereotypical gay male living in the city; Supermana, a transgender superheroine, played by transgender actress Daniel Vives, who deals with women's problems; La Tesorito, played by transgender actress Alejandra Bogue, a parody of TV host and actress Laura Le√≥n; Pita Amor, played by the actor Miguel Romero, and Mama Mela, played by actor Javier Yepez.Desde Gayola, official website. Another prominent Telehit-produced TV show is Guau! (\\"Cool!\\"), currently hosted by Alex Kaffie, Lorena Fern√°ndez, and Sergio T√©llez. Launched in late 2005, Guau! is often considered the only fully gay, Mexican TV show. Literature Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz was a Mexican nun presumed by many to be a lesbian and is considered the greatest lyric poet of the colonial period. The field of literature in Mexico has been particularly propitious to the dissemination of the themes of homosexuality and to the inscriptions of gay and lesbian sensibilities in aesthetic terms.Marina P√©rez de Mendiola. Gender and identity formation in contemporary Mexican literature. p. 107. Routledge, 1998. . El diario de Jos√© Toledo (\\"Jos√© Toledo's Diary\\"; 1964), written by Miguel Barbachano Ponce, earned recognition as the first novel in Mexico to openly inscribe homosexuality in literature.Marina P√©rez de Mendiola. Gender and identity formation in contemporary Mexican literature. p. 108. Routledge, 1998. . Rosamar√≠a Roffiel, an openly lesbian self-taught journalist and writer, wrote the book Amora (1989), which is credited with being the first lesbian novel published in Mexico - that is, the first novel that openly discusses lesbianism and places it in the foreground.Mar√≠a Dolores Costa. Latina lesbian writers and artists. p. 18. Routledge, 2003. . Despite societal prejudices, some LGBT people were able to live fairly open lives and still become successful, especially in the fields of literature and arts. Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz (1648‚Äì1695), considered the greatest lyric poet of the colonial period (1521‚Äì1821), was a Mexican nun presumed by many to be a lesbian because of the passionate love poems she addressed to her benefactress Leonor Carreto, wife of Viceroy Antonio Sebasti√°n de Toledo, and her scathing critique of male abuse of power against women.Mar√≠a Dolores Costa. Latina lesbian writers and artists. p. 10. Routledge, 2003. . Salvador Novo (1904‚Äì1974) was a poet and member of the avant-garde group Los Contempor√°neos, who wrote Nuevo amor (\\"New Love\\"; 1933), considered as one of the best collections of poetry ever written in Spanish.Robert Aldrich, Garry Wotherspoon. Who's who in gay and lesbian history: from antiquity to World War II. p. 391. Second Edition. Routledge, 2003. . His close friend Xavier Villaurrutia (1903‚Äì1950), another prominent member of Los Contempor√°neos, was a poet and playwright, considered as one of Mexico's finest modern writers and major film and art critics. His Nocturno de los √°ngeles (\\"Nocturne of the Angels\\"; 1936) is one of the monuments of gay writing in Latin America.Daniel Balderston, Mike Gonzalez. Encyclopedia of Latin American and Caribbean literature, 1900-2003\\\\. p. 598. Routledge, 2004. . Luis Zapata (b. 1951) has become Mexico's most celebrated gay writer over the past decades, whose first two works helped usher in the 1980s boom of gay literature in Mexico. His literary trajectory is one of increasing personalization and self-exposure, of his own coming out.Haggerty, p. 968. Anthologist and journalist Carlos Monsiv√°is (b. 1938), one of the most highly respected authors in Latin America, is best known as a writer of chronicles and an essayist, mixing both genres in order to describe and explain the complexity of contemporary Mexican society, especially that of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area. Within these parameters, Monsiv√°is acknowledges his gay identity, although it is not the center of his chronicles. In some of his works Monsiv√°is criticizes a patriarchal and homophobic society that tends to ignore, to view with prejudice, and to harass the Mexican gay community and its manifestations.David William Foster, Emmanuel S. Nelson. Latin American writers on gay and lesbian themes: a bio-critical sourcebook. p. 243. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1994. . Like Monsiv√°is, Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Blanco (b. 1951) is primarily known as a journalist and essayist who comments broadly and incisively on the contemporary Mexican scene, particularly that of Mexico City. He includes the gay community in his writings, as in his essay \\"Ojos que da p√°nico so√±ar\\" (\\"Eyes that Could Terrify Dreams\\"; 1979), one of the earliest Mexican texts on homosexual identity, and \\"Las p√∫beres can√©foras\\" (\\"The Pubescent Canephoros\\"; 1983), one of five novels Blanco has published to date.Daniel Balderston, Mike Gonzalez. Encyclopedia of Latin American and Caribbean literature, 1900-2003\\\\. p. 69-70. Routledge, 2004. . Pablo Soler Frost (b. 1965) has published several homoerotic novels, such as Malebolge, which explores the always controversial liaison between homosexual desire and power, and La soldadesca ebria del emperador. Diario de Miguel III (The Emperor's Drunken Soldiery. Journal of Michael III), set in Byzantium. This novel depicts the relationship between the Emperor Michael III and his lover, who afterwards murdered him to ascend the throne as Basil I. The most successful Mexican LGBT author is Luis Zapata Quiroz. He has been criticized for perpetuating the stereotypes of the US pattern of the tragic gay man, even though he never portrays homosexuality as a bad thing. Carlos Monsiv√°is has also considered in his critique the profound homoeroticism of the poets belonging to the group Los Contempor√°neos (\\"The Contemporaries\\") between the late 1920s and mid-1940s. Several of his poets, such as Xavier Villaurrutia, Carlos Pellicer, and Salvador Novo, were gay and \\"let themselves be touched, discreetly, by a theme very dear to the age: the sailors, in the aura of the night port, with their liberty and their beauty\\". The Chicano LGBT community has also created a thriving culture. Thus, Gloria E. Anzald√∫a and Cherr√≠e Moraga are two important authors within the North American LGBT community, and Francisco X. Alarc√≥n, professor at the University of California, has published nine books of poetry. Art Several artists, known as bisexual or homosexual, were reluctant to express their sexual desire in a context of limited tolerance. Agust√≠n Lazo Adalid (1886‚Äì1971), pioneer of surrealism in Mexican art, member of Los Contempor√°neos, and lover of Villaurrutia, abstained from painting male nudity, even though he was known to be homosexual.Bleys, p. 98. Only three paintings by Alfonso Michel (1897‚Äì1957), another member of Los Contempor√°neos, show male nudity in ways that are subtly erotic. Michel was homosexual, and his wealthy family supported his perpetual wanderings around the world in order to avoid a scandal in the conservative state of Colima, where he grew up. Manuel Rodr√≠guez Lozano (1896‚Äì1971), another member of Los Contempor√°neos, never hid his homosexuality and expressed it with great candour in drawings and paintings. His studio attracted younger painters, including Abraham √Ångel (1905‚Äì1924), Julio Castellanos (1905‚Äì1947), and √Ångel Torres Jaramillo (1912‚Äì1937), with whom Lozano maintained relationships.Bleys, p. 101. Frida Kahlo (1901‚Äì1954), is one of the most important artists in modern Mexican art. She has been converted into a gay icon due to her fighter and non-conformist nature. Her work is seen by artists and critics alike as a crucial contribution to the deconstruction of the art world's male prerogatives and to the recognition of gender and sexual diversity as legitimate objects of visual representation.Bleys, p. 106. Rodolfo Morales (1925‚Äì2001) was a famous surrealist painter. Up until his death, Morales was regarded as one of Mexico's greatest living artists.Alberto Blanco. Angel's Kite/La estrella de Angel. p. 32. Children's Book Press, 1998. . Other LGBT painters and visual artists are Roberto Montenegro, Nahum B. Zenil, Julio Gal√°n, Roberto M√°rquez, and Carla Rippey. Mass media and other publications Christian Ch√°vez at a press conference in 2006. Singer, songwriter, and arranger Juan Gabriel (b. 1950) is one of the most popular and respected personalities in contemporary Mexican music. However, for years he was excluded from radio and television on account of being gay.Simon Broughton, Mark Ellingham, Richard Trillo. World Music: Latin and North America, Caribbean, India, Asia and Pacific. p. 465. Second Edition. Rough Guides, 2000. . Mexican singer Chavela Vargas (b. 1919), has one of the most recognizable voices in popular Mexican music. Vargas was faulted for her \\"obscene behavior\\", which included flirting with women in the audience and making spectacular entrances on motorcycles. In her autobiography, Vargas relates that she never intended to make a cause out of lesbianism, but she never chose to hide it either.Mar√≠a Dolores Costa. Latina lesbian writers and artists. p. 20. Routledge, 2003. . Cross-dressing actor Francis Garc√≠a (1958‚Äì2007) made a successful living portraying females in plays and on television shows.Daniel Balderston, Mike Gonz√°lez, Ana M. L√≥pez. Encyclopedia of contemporary Latin American and Caribbean cultures, Volume 1. p. 445. CRC Press, 2000. . Openly bisexual actor Gabriel Romero played one of the first openly gay characters portrayed with dignity on Spanish-language television on 1999 GLAAD Media Award-nominated Telemundo sitcom \\"Los Beltr√°n.\\"Alonso Duralde. The Advocate. 27 March 2001. p. 34. ISSN 0001-8996. Actor, pop star, and former RBD member Christian Ch√°vez (b. 1983) came out in March 2007 after a web site posted pictures of the him kissing another man at a 2005 Canadian civil ceremony. The eventual scandal received massive press coverage. Ch√°vez told BBC News that he did not \\"want to keep on lying\\" and addressed his fans asking them not to judge him for being himself. Ch√°vez is one of the few famous Mexican people who are openly gay. Famous singer-songwriter Gloria Trevi, known as \\"Mexico's Madonna\\", has long supported LGBT people and is considered a gay icon. Trevi was quoted as saying she identified with her gay and lesbian fans because \\"I know what it feels like to be judged, discriminated and rejected.\\" Her 2006 single and gay anthem, \\"Todos me miran\\" (\\"Everybody Is Staring at Me\\") deals with coming out and cross-dressing. Trevi said that she was inspired to write the song after listening to a young friend describe the feelings of hurt and alienation when his conservative family discovered he was gay. Another gay icon is pop singer Paulina Rubio, who has supported same-sex marriage. In late 2008, Rubio criticized actor Eduardo Verastegui for encouraging people to vote \\"yes\\" on Proposition 8 in order to ban same-sex marriage in California. OHM is currently the only Mexican high- profile gay magazine distributed nationwide. Several well-known celebrities have been featured on the cover of the magazine, including actors Gael Garc√≠a and Luis Roberto Guzm√°n; pop singers Belinda, Ari Borovoy and Christian Ch√°vez; and singer-songwriters Miguel Bos√© and Gloria Trevi, among others. Mexico's only lesbian magazine, Les Voz, is sold publicly in Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Tijuana. Elsewhere in Mexico it is only available by subscription, due to the lack of lesbian-friendly outlets outside these centers.David Shuttleton, Richard Phillips, Diane Watt.

According to the First National Poll on Discrimination (2005) in Mexico which was carried out by the CONAPRED, 48% of the Mexican people interviewed indicated that they would not permit a homosexual to live in their house. 95% of the homosexuals interviewed indicated that in Mexico there is discrimination against them; four out of ten declared they were victim of acts of exclusion; more than half said they felt rejected; and six out of ten felt their worst enemy was society. Although overall public displays of homosexual affection or cross-dressing are still taboo in most parts of Mexico, LGBT social life tends to thrive in the country's largest cities and resorts. Population and culture The visible center of the LGBT community is the Zona Rosa, where over 50 gay bars and dance clubs exist. Surrounding the country's capital, there is a sizable amount in the State of Mexico. Some observers claim that gay life is more developed in Mexico's second largest city, Guadalajara.Dynes, Johansson, Percy and Donaldson, p. 807. Other large cities include border city Tijuana, northern city Monterrey, centrist cities Puebla and Le√≥n, and major port city Veracruz. The popularity of gay tourism, especially in Puerto Vallarta, Canc√∫n, and elsewhere, has also brought more national attention to the presence of homosexuality in Mexico.Herrick and Stuart, p. 145. Among some young, urban heterosexuals, it has become popular to attend gay dance clubs and to have openly gay friends. In 1979, the country's first LGBT Pride Parade, also known as LGBT Pride March, was held and attended by over one thousand people in Mexico City.Gonz√°lez, p. 92. Ever since, it has been held every June without interruption under different slogans with the aim of bringing visibility to sexual minorities, encouraging consciousness about AIDS and HIV, denouncing homophobia, and demanding the creation of public policies such as the recognition of same-sex civil unions and same-sex marriages and the legalization of LGBT adoption, among others.Jim√©nez, De la Garza and Glockner, p. 10. According to organizers, in its latest edition, the XXXI LGBT Pride Parade was attended by over 350,000 people, 100,000 more than its predecessor. In 2003, the first Lesbian Pride March occurred in the country's capital.Jim√©nez, De la Garza and Glockner, p. 20. In Guadalajara, well- attended LGBT Pride Parades have been held also every June since 1996. LGBT Pride Parades have continuously occurred in Monterrey,Gonz√°lez, p. 94. Tijuana, Puebla, Veracruz, Xalapa, Cuernavaca, Tuxtla Guti√©rrez,Jim√©nez, De la Garza and Glockner, p. 16. Acapulco, Chilpancingo, and M√©rida.Jim√©nez, De la Garza and Glockner, p. 19. The Mexican gay soccer team, known as El Tri Gay, is the first of its kind in the country. Team member Eduardo Vel√°zquez was quoted saying, In 2007, Mexico participated for the first time in the Gay World Cup, which was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina. However, according to team members, they have been discriminated against by Mexican official soccer organizations, such as the Mexican Football Federation (FMF) and the National Commission for Physical Culture and Sports (CONADE), that have refused to support them because the Gay World Cup is not recognized by FIFA. The team also participated in the 2008 Gay World Cup held in London, UK, and in the 2009 World Outgames held in Copenhagen, Denmark. The team fully participated in the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) \\"LOVE Condoms Campaign\\", all getting publicly tested. One of the gay centers of culture and amusement in Mexico is the Zona Rosa, a series of streets in Colonia Ju√°rez in Mexico City. Since mid-2007, the government of the Federal District and Cuauht√©moc, D.F. ‚Äî in whose territory the Zona Rosa is found ‚Äî have placed operatives in some seedy nightclubs of the Zona Rosa, with the purpose of freeing this tourist zone of problems such as illegal drug trade and prostitution, as well as reducing the incidence of crimes such as theft. Other targets of the program are those sites of cohabitation that lack safety measures for the users ‚Äî mainly emergency exits. LGBT groups have denounced the action as a form of homophobia. Economy The pink peso The pink market (called \\"LGBT market\\", or mercado rosa) in Mexico is calculated at 51,300 million pesos (some US$3,891 million). The group of LGBT consumers, ignored until the present out of homophobia or fear of critics, is being discovered. In 2005 the Gay Expo in Mexico was created, which claimed to know the companies and services of the LGBT community, and the companies of the division have been united into the Union of Companies and Service Providers to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Community (Unegay). A study by the agency De la Riva on the behavior of the LGBT consumer shows that the habits of gay men and lesbians are distinct. While gay men prefer brand names and a riskier lifestyle, lesbians tend to be educated and don't tend to pay attention to brand names. Gays respond to advertisements that make knowing winks to the community but reject advertisements with openly gay themes because they fear being identified through the product. Pink tourism, especially from the US, has one of its favorite destinations in Mexico, and especially Puerto Vallarta, where it is even possible to see men taking a walk hand in hand in the Zona Rom√°ntica. Another favorite destination is Canc√∫n, which has tried to attract the LGBT public with events like the Canc√∫n Mayan Riviera Gay Fall Fiesta and the Canc√∫n International Gay Festival. LGBT tourism focuses not on sun, beaches, and Mayan ruins; it is more diverse. For this public there exist two specialized travel agencies, Opta Tours (since 1991) and Babylon Tours. Tourism Guadalajara and Acapulco were common vacation destinations for gay men and lesbians from Mexico City and, especially, the United States and Canada in the 1980s and 1990s. Since that time, Puerto Vallarta has developed into Mexico's premier resort town as a sort of satellite gay space for its big sister Guadalajara, much as Fire Island is to New York City and Palm Springs is to Los Angeles.Lionel Cant√∫, Nancy A.

Initiated, developed and operated privately by a landholder, the farm has two wind turbines, with a total nameplate capacity of 1.32 MW of renewable electricity which is supplied to the main electricity grid.  Technical information  Wind Corporation Australia, an energy development company, was established in 2000 by founding investor CVC REEF Limited to develop and commission the Hampton Wind Park. Project cost was A$2.4 million, funded by an investment by CVC-REEF and the NSW Sustainable Energy Development Authority (SEDA). Opened in September 2001, the wind farm reduces greenhouse gases by 3,000 tonnes each year over the 20 year life of the project, compared to the equivalent electricity generation from coal. The wind turbines are Vestas V47-660 kW models, with hub height and rotor diameter. The wind farm's output feeds the grid, and creates renewable energy credits which Integral Energy sells to its Green Power subscribers.

He has a memorial in Reading Old Cemetery which is Grade II listed. Life and career Bernard Laurence Hieatt memorial Born in Reading, Berkshire, Hieatt, the son of a Reading butcher, was a member of the Reading and District Motorcycling Club, where he was captain. He was also an air pilot and had his own Moth aeroplane which he used to fly to racing venues. He started in dirt track racing for a while, then went to Brooklands, the famous Surrey racetrack in 1927, to race for various engine manufacturers. Achieving distinction on the road and track, he competed on a Cotton in the 1928 TT Races on the Isle of Man when he finished 9th and in 1929 he started in three races but did not finish in any of these races. He was part of the British Motor Cycle team, touring Europe and Egypt and in 1929 won the ‚ÄòSir Charles Wakefield Cup' at Brooklands. He took several world records, creating two world records in the two hundred miles motorcycle and side car race and won races at Brooklands. He achieved a coveted BMCRC 'Gold Star' in 1929 for lapping the Brooklands track at over 100 mph. Death On 3 May 1930 at Brooklands, Hieatt had broken the 100 miles record and the 2 hours record, covering . This was achieved despite heavy rain and poor visibility. Hieatt's motorcycle had sufficient fuel for the race, but a leaking tank forced him into the pits 8 laps from the finish. During the refuelling pitstop, Hieatt also swapped his goggles for a new pair, as the ones he was wearing were covered in mud. After rejoining the race, Hieatt was leading by a lap and a half when an official went out on to the track with a large red disc, signalling Hieatt to slow down to , although it seemed Hieatt did not see him. With another bike in front of him, Hieatt attempted an overtake on the inside, but steered too close to the grass verge. The side car wheel struck the grass verge at , turning the motorcycle over. F. Mathews, the sidecar passenger, was trapped face downwards, but escaped with severe shock. Hieatt was thrown into the air and hit a concrete post, breaking his leg, shattering his skull and lacerating his brain; he died instantly. Officials and a doctor quickly arrived with an ambulance to the crash site. When Hieatt was found he was not wearing goggles, leading to the assumption that he threw them off while still riding. Hieatt's death was the first motorcycling fatality at Brooklands since the First World War. Death by misadventure was the verdict of the inquest, while an official described Bernard as, \\"one of the finest riders on the track and in every respect an all round man\\".  Legacy  Memorial inscription Bernard Laurence Hieatt's grave in Reading Old Cemetery in Cemetery Junction in Reading is a Grade II listed memorial, with a statue of him in full racing gear. On the memorial it reads, A development of flats on Silver Street, Reading has also been named Hieatt Close in his honour.

The regiment was raised in October 1914, and assigned to the 2nd Light Horse Brigade. The regiment fought against the forces of the Ottoman Empire, in Egypt, at Gallipoli, on the Sinai Peninsula, and in Palestine and Jordan. After the armistice the regiment eventually returned to Australia in March 1919. For its role in the war the regiment was awarded sixteen battle honours. During the inter-war years, the regiment was re-raised as a part-time unit based in New South Wales. It was later converted to a motor regiment during the Second World War but was disbanded in late 1943 without having been deployed overseas. Formation The 7th Light Horse Regiment was raised at Sydney in October 1914. and comprised twenty-five officers and 497 other ranks serving in three squadrons, each of six troops.Gullett 1941, p. 54. Each troop was divided into eight sections, of four men each. In action one man of each section, was nominated as a horse holder reducing the regiments rifle strength by a quarter.Horner and Williams, Chapter: Setting up the Light Horse Its manpower being mostly recruited from residents of New South Wales. Once formed, the regiment was assigned to the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, serving alongside the 5th and 6th Light Horse Regiments. All Australian Light Horse regiments used cavalry unit designations, but were mounted infantry armed with rifles, not swords or lances,Gullett 1941, p. 29. and mounted exclusively on the Australian Waler horse.Gullett 1941, p. 38. Operational history 7th Light Horse at Gallipoli Gallipoli In December 1914, the 7th Light Horse Regiment left Sydney for Egypt, arriving on the 1 February 1915. When the Australian infantry units were dispatched to Gallipoli, it was thought the terrain was unsuitable for mounted troops, and the light horse regiments remained in Egypt. However, heavy casualties amongst the Australian infantry resulted in the deployment of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade as reinforcements in May 1915. On arrival the regiment was attached to the 1st Division, who by this stage of the campaign were fighting a defensive battle around the beachhead around Anzac Cove. The regiment was withdrawn back to Egypt at the end of the campaign in December 1915. Sinai and Palestine Campaign 7th Light Horse Regiment signaller On their arrival back in Egypt, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was assigned to the newly raised ANZAC Mounted Division, at first given responsibility for the defence of the Suez Canal. Their first battles were at Romani and Katia in early August 1916. They were then used to patrol the large open area of Sinai, until the British advance into Palestine, subsequently becoming involved in the unsuccessful first, second battles of Gaza in March and April 1916. They then took part in the successful Battle of Beersheba in the following October. With the Ottoman Empire forces in retreat, the regiment was part of the pursuit into Palestine, resulting in the capture of Jerusalem in 1917, and raid across the River Jordan, at Amman and Es Salt. The war in the Middle East ended shortly afterwards when the armistice of Mudros was signed in October 1918. The regiment returned to Egypt to assist in putting down a revolt, then sailed for Australia in June 1919. The war cost the regiment 165 killed and 655 wounded. Perpetuation In 1921, the decision was made to perpetuate the honours and traditions of the AIF by reorganising the units of the Citizens Force to replicate the numerical designations of their related AIF units.Grey 2008, p. 125. As a result, the 7th Light Horse was re-raised as a part-time unit based in the 2nd Military District, which encompassed the majority of the state of New South Wales; in doing so, it assumed the lineage of several previously existing militia units, including the 11th Light Horse (Australian Horse), which had been formed in 1912, and the 3rd Australian Light Horse Regiment (Australian Horse), which had been formed in 1903 as part of the amalgamation of Australia's colonial forces into the Australian Army after Federation.Festberg 1972, p. 43. In early 1937, the regiment was amalgamated with the 21st Light Horse to form the 7th/21st Light Horse (Australian Horse); however, the two units were split again later the same year. The unit remained on the order of battle throughout the rest of the inter-war years, and upon the outbreak of the Second World War, the 7th Light Horse formed part of the 6th Cavalry Brigade,Finlayson 2012, p. 196. headquartered around Goulburn, New South Wales. On 14 March 1942, the 7th was converted into a motor regiment, adopting the designation of the 7th Motor Regiment (Australian Horse). As the Australian Army undertook a partial demobilisation, the regiment was deemed surplus to requirements and in November 1943 it was disbanded without having seen operational service during the war. During the war years, the regiment was variously assigned to the 4th and 2nd Motor Brigades. In the post-war period, the regiment was re-raised as an amalgamated unit, designated the 7th/21st Australian Horse. Formed in July 1948, this unit was established as a reconnaissance regiment within the 2nd Division, and remained in existence until 15 September 1957 when it was disbanded;Finlayson 2012, p. 322. its personnel were later used to re-raise the 4th Infantry Battalion, which later became part of the Royal New South Wales Regiment.Festberg 1972, pp. 27, 37 & 61.

Noted for her research on colour and movement she became interested, very early on, in the question of how women are represented. She was invited by the Centre Georges Pompidou in June 2019 to take part in a round table on this subject , on the occasion of Dora Maar Exhibition ( https://www.centrepompidou.fr/id/cznb6dK/reEr9a6/fr ). Her photos were exhibited as early as 2002 at the Marion Meyer Gallery during the Month of Photography in Paris, then in numerous solo exhibitions around the world, notably in New York (SLE Gallery in 2009, 2011 and 2016), Tokyo (at Gallery 21 in 2010) and London (Scream Gallery, 2008) and at many international fairs (such as Palm Beach Modern + Contemporary Art Fair, Miami in 2019 and 2020). She collaborates with houses such as Herm√®s, Balenciaga, Courr√®ges, John Galliano or Astier de Villatte and many international press titles (such as Vogue Italia, German Vogue, Vogue Japan, Interview or Another Magazine). In 2011, the photography historian and critic Vicki Goldberg wrote about her work: ‚ÄúSophie Delaporte is a French photographer who is on permanently good terms with fantasy and a cheerfully offbeat approach. She has a distinctive sense of color, a fabulist‚Äôs imagination, an edge of surrealism, and a knack for ambiguous narrative‚Äù.

Additionally, no explicit connection had been made prior between gender and sexual preference. The Japanese adopted the English term gender (jendaa) to describe cultural concepts of feminine and masculine. Previously, sei was used to distinguish the binary biological sexes, female and male, as well as the concept of gender. Many terms describing gender presentation had vastly irregular meanings such as okama, whose definitions included: a gay male, a feminine-behaving male, or a crossdresser. Umbrella terms such as these had a negative sociological impact, generalizing various queer identities into a single concept. Similar to the experience of LGBT persons in other countries, Japanese LGBT people lacked the linguistic space to exist in.  Controversies  Terms such as hentai, having long been used in the pejorative sense, have recently been reclaimed by the LGBT community in Japan. Specialized publications featuring LGBT content have been using the term hentai zasshi or \\"perverted publications.\\" Many Japanese-to-English translators for LGBT content believe that the use of the term hentai roughly equates to that of the English term queer.  Other LGBT terms  Though the Japanese have borrowed a number of foreign terms in the process of globalization, Japan is by no means a passive recipient of Western discourse. Foreign terms have been selectively used to deliver nuanced Japanese understandings of sexual and gender identity. It is important to note that homophones such as the Japanese gei and the English \\"gay\\" do not denote the same meaning or connotation. LGBT figures in popular media A number of personalities who appear on television in Japan daily are gay or transgender, or cultivate such an image as part of their public persona. A number of artists, nearly all male, have begun to speak publicly about their homosexuality, appearing on various talk shows and other programs, their celebrity often focused on their sexuality; twin pop-culture critics Piko and Osugi are an example.Pride vs. prejudice Akihiro Miwa, a drag queen and former lover of author Yukio Mishima, is the television advertisement spokesperson for many Japanese companies ranging from beauty to financial products.On Japanese Tv, The Lady Is A Man Cross-dressing 'onnagata' Are Popular For Being Outspoken Kenichi Mikawa, a former pop idol singer who now blurs the line between male and female costuming and make-up, can also regularly be seen on various programs, as can crossdressing entertainer Peter.From the stage to the clinic: changing transgender identities in post-war Japan Singer-songwriter and actress Ataru Nakamura was one of the first transgender personalities to become highly popular in Japan; in fact, sales of her music rose after she came out as a transgender woman in 2006. Some non-gay entertainers have used stereotypical references to homosexuality to increase their profile. Razor Ramon Sumitani a.k.a. Hard Gay (HG), a comedian, shot to fame after he began to appear in public wearing a leather harness, hot pants and cap. His outfit, name, and trademark pelvis thrusting and squeals earned him the adoration of fans and the scorn of many in the Japanese gay community. Ai Haruna and Ayana Tsubaki, two high-profile transgender celebrities, have gained popularity and have been making the rounds on some very popular Japanese variety shows.Television perpetuates outmoded gender stereotypes , Hiromi, a fashion model, came out as a lesbian.\\"Model Hiromi comes out as a homosexual : 'Love doesn't have any form, color and rule'\\" , 18 February 2011, Yahoo! News - Yahoo! Japan from RBB Today A greater amount of gay and transgender characters have also begun appearing (with positive portrayals) on Japanese television, such as the highly successful Hanazakari no Kimitachi e and Last Friends television series. In anime and manga There is a genre of anime and manga that focuses on gay male romance (and sometimes explicit content) known as yaoi. Yaoi titles are primarily marketed to women, and are commonplace in bookstores (normally found in or near to the sh≈çjo manga section). Various terms are used in Japan to refer to yaoi. The blanket term \\"yaoi\\" is an acronym for the phrase \\"Yama nashi, ochi nashi, imi nashi\\", which means \\"no peak, no point, no meaning\\". (A backronym meant as a joke identifies it as \\"Yamete, oshiri (ga) itai\\" which literally means \\"Stop, my bottom hurts!\\"). \\"June\\" refers to plots containing romance and drama that feature mature, adult male characters. \\"BL\\" (\\"Boys' Love\\") refers to stories that either contain younger characters, or more light-hearted romance (as an alternative to more sexual content). The phrase \\"sh≈çnen-ai\\", translated from Japanese in the past as \\"boy love\\", is used to describe non-sexual homosexuality in either adult male characters or younger male characters. When manga or anime depicts sexual activities between young boys, or young boys with adults (male or female), it is known as \\"shotacon\\", which should not be confused with \\"sh≈çnen-ai\\". Among the large fan demographics in Western countries, this terminology is more or less condensed to \\"yaoi\\" and \\"sh≈çnen- ai\\"; \\"yaoi\\" is used in reference to graphic descriptions of homosexual sex and/or adult drama, and \\"sh≈çnen-ai\\" is used in reference to romantic situations with younger characters. Gei-comi (\\"gay-comics\\") are gay-romance themed comics aimed at gay men. While yaoi comics often assign one partner to a stereotypical heterosexual female role, gei-comi generally depict both partners as masculine and in an equal relationship. Another common term for this genre is bara, stemming from the name of the first publication of this genre to gain popularity in Japan, Barazoku. The former term is more common in Japan, used similarly to yaoi as a blanket term for a wide range of publications, while the latter is more common in the West and more often refers to a general aesthetic rather than specifically the genre of comics. Lesbian-romance themed anime and manga is known as yuri (which means \\"lily\\"). Yuri is used as a catch-all term, much more so than yaoi; it is used to describe female-female relationships in material marketed to straight men, straight women, or lesbians, despite significant stylistic and thematic differences between works aimed at these different audiences. Another word that has recently become popular in Japan as an equivalent of yuri is \\"GL\\" (meaning \\"Girls' Love\\" and obviously inspired by \\"Boys' Love\\"). Unlike yaoi, yuri is aimed at a more widespread audience. There are a variety of yuri titles (or titles that heavily integrate yuri content) aimed at women, such as Revolutionary Girl Utena, Oniisama E, Maria-sama ga Miteru, Sailor Moon (most notably the third season, as well as the fifth season), Strawberry Shake Sweet, Love My Life, etc.; and there are a variety of yuri titles (or titles that heavily integrate yuri content) aimed at men, such as Kannazuki no Miko, Strawberry Panic! (although it was written by Sakurako Kimino, a female author), Simoun, and My-Hime. There are two manga magazines currently running in Japan that focus solely on yuri stories: Comic Yuri Hime (which is primarily aimed at women), and its newer spin-off, Comic Yuri Hime S (which is primarily aimed at men). While more yaoi manga exists, more yuri tends to be animated.  In other media  With the rise of a visible gay community and the attendant rise of media for gay audiences, the Hadaka Matsuri (\\"Naked Festival\\") has become a fantasy scenario for gay videos.Male homosexuality in modern Japan: cultural myths and social realities By Mark J. McLelland, p.122; accessed through Google Books Superstar Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki dedicated a song to celebrate gay rights titled \\"How Beautiful You Are\\". The music video depicted gay couples and lesbian couples kissing and celebrating.

As a result, the same ideas can be represented using a smaller set of words. In most applications, semantic compression is a lossy compression, that is, increased prolixity does not compensate for the lexical compression, and an original document cannot be reconstructed in a reverse process. By generalization Semantic compression is basically achieved in two steps, using frequency dictionaries and semantic network: # determining cumulated term frequencies to identify target lexicon, # replacing less frequent terms with their hypernyms (generalization) from target lexicon.D. Ceglarek, K. Haniewicz, W. Rutkowski, Semantic Compression for Specialised Information Retrieval Systems, Advances in Intelligent Information and Database Systems, vol. 283, p. 111-121, 2010 Step 1 requires assembling word frequencies and information on semantic relationships, specifically hyponymy. Moving upwards in word hierarchy, a cumulative concept frequency is calculating by adding a sum of hyponyms' frequencies to frequency of their hypernym: cum f(k_{i}) = f(k_{i}) + \\\\sum_{j} cum f(k_{j}) where k_{i} is a hypernym of k_{j}. Then, a desired number of words with top cumulated frequencies are chosen to build a targed lexicon. In the second step, compression mapping rules are defined for the remaining words, in order to handle every occurrence of a less frequent hyponym as its hypernym in output text. ;Example The below fragment of text has been processed by the semantic compression. Words in bold have been replaced by their hypernyms. > They are both nest building social insects, but paper wasps and honey bees > organize their colonies in very different ways. In a new study, researchers > report that despite their differences, these insects rely on the same > network of genes to guide their social behavior.The study appears in the > Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. Honey bees and > paper wasps are separated by more than 100 million years of evolution, and > there are striking differences in how they divvy up the work of maintaining > a colony. The procedure outputs the following text: > They are both facility building insect, but insects and honey insects > arrange their biological groups in very different structure.

Implicit semantic compression A natural tendency to keep natural language expressions concise can be perceived as a form of implicit semantic compression, by omitting unmeaningful words or redundant meaningful words (especially to avoid pleonasms).N.

Percova, On the types of semantic compression of text, COLING '82 Proceedings of the 9th Conference on Computational Linguistics, vol. 2, p. 229-231, 1982 Applications and advantages In the vector space model, compacting a lexicon leads to a reduction of dimensionality, which results in less computational complexity and a positive influence on efficiency. Semantic compression is advantageous in information retrieval tasks, improving their effectiveness (in terms of both precision and recall).D. Ceglarek, K. Haniewicz, W.

In 1848 Corbett also hired a partner, Charles Beecroft, and in 1848 the toy store was renamed Beecroft's. In the 20th century, Charles's son John Henry became Beecroft's owner, followed by Thomas and then his son John Hooton Beecroft. The shop moved frequently during these periods, first to the Elizabethan House at 9 High Street, then to \\"Beecroft‚Äôs Corner\\" at the Exchange Building on Market Square. In 1926, the shop moved to 12 Pelham Street, then 42, and finally settled at 16-18 Street. This toy shop is remembered in the memories of local people who were children at the time. In the late 1870s, Beecroft's began issuing brass tokens ‚Äì also known as tickets ‚Äì as advertising. Each ticket is a stock reverse die showing the head of George III, George IV, or Victoria, with the other side listing the address of Beecroft's at the time of issue. These tickets are now very rare and much sought after by numismatists and collectors. Farmers used to advertise for farm workers on market days ‚Äì this led to the famous Beecroft's famous jingle ending \\"When we were boys, we bought our toys at Beecroft's. Now we are men, we go again to Beecroft's\\". Between 1960 and 1972, Beecroft's held a regular stall at the Central Market in Nottingham and at the world famous Goose Fair.

It has been referred to as the last witch trial in Denmark, and the end of the belief in witchcraft among the Danish authorities. The witch trial started with the fits of cramp- and nervous attacks of 27-year-old Maren Christensdatter Spillemand. In January 1696, the local vicar, Ole Bjorn, diagnosed her fits as demonic possession. Soon, several other young women was afflicted by the same attacks. The fits were considered to be possessions caused by sorcery, and several local women were pointed out as responsible. The accused were arrested and put on trial, and a local court sentenced them guilty to be burned at the stake for witchcraft. Some of the allegedly possessed women, however, admitted to Bishop Jens Bircherod that they had lied and not been afflicted by any fits. This led to the death sentences being revoked and the condemned freed from charges at the higher court. The falsely possessed women and the local vicar were tried before a commission's court in √Ölborg and sentenced to death. Their death sentences were revoked by the high court and the monarch to imprisonment for the women, exile for the vicar and warnings to the other people involved in the witch trial. After this, the Danish authorities were reluctant to accept any more charges of witchcraft. When the local court of Schelenburg condemned two women to be burned at the stake for witchcraft in 1708, the sentence was revoked by the high court. In 1722, a soldier was executed for witchcraft in Bremerholm, but he was judged and executed by a military court. In 1733 a student and in 1752 a farmer were sentenced to life imprisonment and forced labour after having been judged guilty of a pact with the Devil, and as late as 1803 two craftsmen were sentenced for the same crime. Long after the legal courts stopped executing witches, however, the belief in witches led to private trials and lynching of alleged witches. In √òster Gr√∏nning in Salling in 1722, the villagers apprehended Dorte Jensdatter, whom they suspected of having caused death by magic, and executed her by burning after a private witch trial by tying her up and burning down her home with her in it. The last case is often said to have been that of Anna Klemens, who was pointed out as a witch in Brigsted at Horsens and beaten to death in 1800.

Visuospatial dysgnosia is often linked with topographical disorientation. Symptoms The syndrome rarely presents itself the same way in every patient. Some symptoms that occur may be: * Constructional apraxia: difficulty in constructing: drawing, copying, designs, copying 3D models * Topographical disorientation: difficulty finding one's way in the environment * Optic ataxia: deficit in visually-guided reaching * Ocular motor apraxia: inability to direct gaze, a breakdown (failure) in starting (initiating) fast eye movements * Dressing apraxia: difficulty in dressing usually related to inability to orient clothing spatially, and to a disrupted awareness of body parts and the position of the body and its parts in relation to themselves and objects in the environment * Right-left confusion: difficulty in distinguishing the difference between the directions left and right Lesion areas Studies have narrowed the area of the brain that, when damaged, causes visuospatial dysgnosia to the border of the occipito-temporoparietal region. Predominantly, lesions (damage, often from stroke) are found in the angular gyrus of the right hemisphere (in people with left-hemisphere language), and are usually unilateral, meaning in one hemisphere of the brain. Bilateral lesions produce more complex dysgnosic signs such as object anomia (inability to name an object), prosopagnosia (inability to recognize faces), alexia (inability to read), dressing apraxia, and memory impairment in conjunction with visuospatial dysgnosia symptoms. Visuospatial dysgnosia has many symptoms in common with B√°lint's syndrome and can present simultaneously. Visuospatial dysgnosia, along with Balint's syndrome, has been connected with Alzheimer's disease as a possible early sign of the disease. Generally, the first symptom of Alzheimer's onset is loss of memory, but visual or visuospatial dysfunction is the presenting symptom in some cases and is common later in the disease course. Case studies David G. Cogan, in 1979, published an extensive work describing 17 cases of visuospatial dysgnosia. Some examples of patients suffering from visuospatial dysgnosia from Cogan's study are: * Case Study 1: A 60-year-old man, while driving his car, became confused and lost his way in a familiar environment. He walked to the garage, located his car without difficulty but climbed into the left rear seat by mistake. He was able to drive out of the garage but found it hard to locate the wheel and ignition. * Case Study 3: A 69-year-old man missed objects when pointing to them and made errors when trying to reach for them. But he could recognize colors and had normal visual acuity. * Case Study 13: A 57-year-old woman with presumed Alzheimer's disease was unable to read. She could see individual letters but could not combine them into meaningful words or sentences. She could recognize objects by touch better with her eyes closed than with them open, which she often did to recognize objects. She also had object agnosia, which she overcame by touching objects to recognize them. It can clearly be seen that visuospatial dysgnosia does not present itself in the same ways, though all of the above cases were diagnosed with the disorder and other accompanying diseases. Therapies For patients with visuospatial dysgnosia, the information input may be strengthened by adding tactile, motor, and verbal perceptual inputs. This comes from the general occupational therapy practice of teaching clients suffering from intellectual dysfunctions to use the most effective combinations of perceptual input modalities, which may enable them to complete a task.

It was remade in 1989 as Three Fugitives, also directed by Veber.  Plot  After serving a five-year sentence for 14 bank robberies, Jean Lucas (Depardieu) is released from prison. He intends to end his criminal lifestyle, but on his release day, when he goes to the bank to open an account, he is taken hostage by Fran√ßois Pignon (Richard), who takes too much time robbing the bank, allowing the police to appear, and accidentally shoots Jean in the leg. However, Lucas' former nemesis, police commissioner Duroc (Maurice Barrier), doesn't believe Jean is a hostage, given their common past. Jean forces Fran√ßois to go to the police and confess to being the robber so that Jean's name would be cleared, but once they arrive at the police station, the police mistake Jean as the robber, forcing him to escape. Fran√ßois follows, and ends up taking him to Dr. Martin (Jean Carmet), a senile veterinarian friend of his late father, to treat his bullet wound. Fran√ßois was a former chief of sales at a textile factory, which went out of business three years ago, leaving him unemployed, and his daughter Jeanne (Ana√Øs Bret) has been catatonic since the death of Fran√ßois' wife around the same time he lost his job. Not wanting to leave his daughter, he asks for Jean's help to get him a new identity so that he can escape the country. Reluctantly, Jean contacts his old friend Labib (Jean Benguigui), asking him to hook Fran√ßois up with a fake ID. However, upon meeting, Labib informs Fran√ßois that his price for a new passport has now changed from 2,500 Francs to 500,000. However, Fran√ßois only made away with 84,000 Francs from the robbery. Upon learning this, Labib calls Jean, threatening to take Fran√ßois to the police if Jean doesn't get him 500,000 Francs in 24 hours. With Jeanne in tow, Jean steals a van and crashes into Labib's bar, rescuing Fran√ßois. Fran√ßois then signs a written confession for Jean to present to the police. Jean suggests to Fran√ßois that he turn himself in, for he could get away with just one year in prison. However, just as he prepares to leave, Jeanne, who has come to care for Jean, asks him to stay, breaking out of her catatonic state. When Jean refuses, Jeanne runs off. Fran√ßois and Jean chase her and see her run into a park, where a stranger takes her to the police. Witnessing the police take away his daughter, Fran√ßois decides to kidnap her and leave the country. Jean suggests that he turn himself in and face the one-year jail time, promising that he'll visit Jeanne in the meantime. Jean meets up with Duroc and presents him the written confession, and is vindicated. He takes a job as a locksmith, and goes to visit Jeanne in the orphanage, where she has relapsed into a catatonic state, now even refusing to eat and speak to him. Later that night, Fran√ßois attempts to get Jeanne out of the orphanage, and is soon joined by Jean. However, at first, Jean takes the wrong girl from the bed, and when she screams, the police officer guarding Jeanne is alerted. However, she trips on toys and drops her revolver, which Fran√ßois uses to force her to lead him to Jeanne. Jean and Fran√ßois escape from the orphanage with Jeanne, who is suffering from lack of food. However, Jean gets a new client in the middle of the night - an intoxicated doctor who, after a night of partying, has lost his keys. After the doctor examines Jeanne, he discovers her very low blood pressure, gives her a pill of tonicardiaque, and advises the men to feed her normally. Jean and Fran√ßois break into a house where Jean changed the locks and the owners are on vacation. However, later that night, when he goes to make preparations for leaving the country, Jean runs into Duroc, who informs him that the police have set up barricades across the country. Realizing that he will not be able to get Fran√ßois and Jeanne across the border, Jean hatches a plan after finding the family's passports in the house. They dress up and pretend to be the vacationing family - Jean being the father, Fran√ßois the mother, and Jeanne, after Jean giving her a haircut, as their son, Jean-Claude - and leave for a cross-country road trip in a stolen Renault 25. To get past a police roadblock, Jean lies to the policeman that his \\"wife\\" is pregnant and about to go in labor. The policeman in charge assigns two motorcycle police to escort them to the hospital, but they don't leave until the orderlies arrive to ferry Fran√ßois inside. However, as soon as they are gone, Fran√ßois jumps up from the stretcher and runs for the car, with Jean covering it up as a \\"nervous pregnancy\\". Eventually, Jean, Fran√ßois and Jeanne arrive at the Franco-Italian border, where Jean points out the way to Italy and promises to visit them one day, intending to stay in France and continue his own life there. When Fran√ßois and Jeanne leave, Jean watches them disappearing from a distance. However, after seeing Fran√ßois nearly trip on the dress he's wearing as a disguise, Jean decides to join them.

The Pangi Valley was described by Dr. J Hutchison (in 1904) as follows: :\\"Pangi is unique in its grandeur and beauty: in this respect far surpassing any other portion of Chamba District. The scenery is sublime and imposing, and nature appears in her wildest and grandest moods. Everything is on a stupendous scale. The great river rolls along In a deep and narrow gorge, lashing itself into fury against the adamantine cliffs that confine it. Precipices spring from the brink, in places almost perpendicular, to a height of one or two thousand feet: on the lower ranges are grassy slopes of rich pasture with dense forests of pine and cedar, while high over all, the stern and majestic mountains, piled on one another, attain in altitude of 18,000 to 21,000 feet rising far beyond the line of eternal snow. But all is not sublimity and grandeur. Every few miles the traveller reaches fairly open nooks of surpassing beauties, which may have been small lakes in some bygone age, while the river was cutting its way through a rocky barrier in front. There the villages are chiefly to be found. These are few in number, and of small size, for the region is sparsely inhabited.\\"Quoted in: Appendix III (pages 83-6) is Extract from the Punjab States Gazetteer, Vol XXII A, Chamba State, 1904 (pps. 261‚Äì266) by Dr. Hutchinson Appendix IV (pages 87-8) is Extract taken from Guide to Dalhousie, The Chamba state and the neighbouring Hills compiled by Captain J.

Early life Orlando was educated at De La Salle College, Malta and the University of Malta. He graduated as a dental surgeon in 1987. He lives in ≈ªebbuƒ°, Malta. Orlando was very active, politically, as a student. He organised his first demonstration at the age of sixteen against the educational policies of the Socialist regime at the time. He was elected to represent his fellow students on the Faculty Board of the Faculty of Dental Surgery (UOM). He was also very active in the Nationalist Party youth movement (M≈ªPN). Political Life He was the first councillor elected to represent the Nationalist Party on the ≈ªebbuƒ° Local Council in 1992. He subsequently contested the 1996, 1998, 2003 and 2008 General Elections successfully. He was elected from two districts in the 2008 elections, being the first MP elected from one of them and the Nationalist Party MP to get the greatest number of votes from the other. His total number of first count votes was 5131. A controversy surrounding land he owned at Mistra became a major issue in the run-up to these elections. Joseph Muscat, the leader of the Labour Party and Prime Minister, has revealed that this was a mise en sc√®ne concocted by the Nationalist Party to discredit his predecessor, Alfred Sant (). The ruse was instrumental in the PN victory in those elections (). He is reported to have been encouraged by 5 successive leaders of the two main political parties in Malta, PN (Nationalist Party) and PL (Labour Party), to contest on their ticket. Pullicino Orlando accepted to contest the 2017 general elections with the Labour Party on the insistence of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat. Notwithstanding a very short 10 day campaign, he managed to get a good result but failed to get re-elected. His clinic in Zebbug was targeted by arsonists a few days after these elections in what was clearly a politically motivated attack. His candidature with the Labour Party had been met with fierce criticism from die-hard Nationalists. He has held the posts of Shadow Minister for Telecommunications, Head of Delegation of the Maltese Parliamentary Delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Vice-President of the Assembly and is currently Executive Chairman of the Malta Council for Science and Technology (MCST). Malta Council for Science and Technology He was appointed Chairman of the Council in March 2010 by Nationalist Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi. His term was extended twice by the Labour administration led by Joseph Muscat. His reappointment as Executive Chairman was confirmed by the administration led by Prime Minister Robert Abela in 2020, immediately after he took over as Prime Minister. Under his stewardship, the MCST has grown considerably. The number of employees has increased from less than 10 in 2010 to over 130 at present. Its remit has expanded to include areas such as Space and PRIMA (Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area) and there has been an exponential increase in international collaborative initiatives in Research and Innovation (R and I). He has overseen the development of Malta‚Äôs National Interactive Science Centre (Esplora), a state of the art facility which has become one of Malta‚Äôs foremost visitor attractions. The development of Esplora involved the rehabilitation of the former Bighi Naval Hospital, which was in a state of imminent collapse, into a 22,000 square metre complex which includes a unique Planetarium and well over 200 interactive exhibits. This complicated project, which was partly financed by EU Structural Funding, was completed in two and a half years. Esplora was inaugurated by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat on 28 October 2016. The Centre was selected by the European Commission as one of the Emblematic Projects for the 30th Anniversary of the Cohesion Policy in April 2018.The Centre was selected by the European Commission as one of the Emblematic Projects for the 30th Anniversary of the Cohesion Policy in April 2018. He is now in the process of developing a new visitor centre, EsploraNatura, which will be focused on Natural History. The project will see the old Natural History Museum in Vilhena Palace being closed and the palace restored to its original glory. The exhibits will be transferred to a new centre on the east side of the Bighi peninsula and the experience will be ameliorated with the addition of several new exhibits and the use of cutting- edge technology. Notable campaigns Pullicino Orlando has been involved in a number of notable campaigns. He successfully campaigned against the establishment of a cement plant in the central part of the island which could have had a detrimental impact on his constituents‚Äô health, a waste landfill next to the prehistoric temples of Mnajdra and an underground museum which could have potentially damaged St John's Co-Cathedral in Valletta. He had the wide support of civil society on these issues. These campaigns often brought him at odds with big business concerns. He militated against abortion in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.[1] He campaigned for the introduction of divorce in Malta in 2011 (2011 Maltese divorce referendum). He set up what was probably the only political movement in Maltese history to include individuals hailing from all parts of the political spectrum - Moviment IVA ghad-Divorzju, IVA ghaz-zwieg (The pro-divorce movement). This movement successfully campaigned against the joint might of the Nationalist Party in Government and the Church. He also campaigned for gay rights and was instrumental in the introduction of legislation regulating In Vitro Fertilisation in Malta. Militating in favour of such controversial issues in predominantly Catholic Malta has made him the target of conservative journalists and columnists. Threats to his family have also been reported. He set up the Anti-Cyberharassment Alliance in August 2013, together with a number of prominent individuals such as the former Chairperson of the pro- divorce movement, Parliamentary Secretary Dr Deborah Schembri, and former minister Jesmond Mugliett. The Alliance successfully put the issues of Cyberharassment and Cyberbullying on the national agenda. Independent MP He resigned from the Nationalist Party on 20 July 2012, hence making him an Independent MP. He cited serious differences with high ranking Party officials as the reason for doing so. He did not contest the following elections in 2013.

It is a nocturne depicting the home of Florence Griswold, now the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme, Connecticut. It was the first contemporary painting purchased by the Corcoran Gallery of Art, and is Metcalf's \\"most celebrated work.\\"Gerdts, et al, 62 Background Metcalf arrived at the Old Lyme Art Colony at the invitation of his friend Childe Hassam, and summered there from 1905 to 1907. During the spring, summer and autumn of 1906 Metcalf enjoyed what was to that point his most productive year, finishing twenty-six paintings.Chambers, et al, 52 With greater productivity as a landscape painter came an increased exploration of different themes, seasons, and times of day. One of the themes that Metcalf attempted was the nocturne, a subject which had become popular in the Old Lyme colony of artists. The subject's romantic associations and subtle color harmonies reconciled the opposing tendencies of Tonalism and Impressionism within the colony.Chambers, et al, 116 By 1903 Frank DuMond had begun teaching the painting of moonlight subjects to his students in Old Lyme, and the theme was popular as a studio alternative to painting outdoors in poor weather.Chambers, et al, 46 In July 1906 Hassam wrote about Metcalf to J. Alden Weir: \\"Metty is working hard at a moonlight. We are all doing moonlights. The weather has been so bad that we have been forced to it.\\"Chambers, et al, 46 Metcalf began painting May Night in the spring of 1906, and finished it in early September.Chambers, et al, 53 The subject is the front lawn and facade of the Griswold House, its Ionic columns seen in an atmospheric moonlight. In the foreground, shadows are cast on the lawn by trees. Touches of warmth are provided by the light emanating from within the house. Two figures are present: One woman walks across the lawn toward the house while another sits on the front porch, each of them clad in long pale dresses, which, for Metcalf biographer Bruce W. Chambers, heighten \\"the feeling of elegant tranquility.\\"Chambers, et al, 53 Impact May Night romanticized the condition of the property, which at the time suffered from peeling paint and uncut shrubbery.Chambers, et al, 53 It also acknowledged the centrality of Florence Griswold to the creative community. According to Arthur Heming, whom Metcalf invited to view the painting soon after it was completed, the figure walking toward the house was intended to be Florence Griswold.Chambers, et al, 13 As he admired the painting in Metcalf's studio, Miss Florence entered. Metcalf attempted to give her the painting in return for room and board, and she refused, saying \\"It's the best thing you've ever done. When you show it in New York, they'll snap it up at once, and everything will be lovely.\\"Chambers, et al, 13KainScanlan The painting soon had a profound impact on Metcalf's career, and on the Old Lyme colony.Gerdts, 196ScanlanChambers, et al, 14 It was exhibited in November at the St. Botolph Club in Boston, and in January 1907 at the Corcoran Gallery's inaugural exhibition of contemporary art. There it was awarded the Clark Gold Medal and $1,000, and was bought by the Corcoran for $3,000, thus becoming the gallery's first purchase of a contemporary American painting.Chambers, et al, 14Scanlan As a result of the publicity from the exhibitions and sale of May Night, Metcalf's reputation, already well established, benefited both financially and critically: \\"From this time he was an acclaimed master of the Impressionist landscape.\\"Gerdts, 196 After seeing the painting in Boston in November 1906, artist and critic Philip Leslie Hale wrote \\"One could hardly get a stronger sense of the beauty and mystery of night and springtime ... all changed to something new and strange by the magic of dim reflected light of the moon.\\"Chambers, et al, 116 A critic in the Art Annual wrote \\"It is a little weird, and like a dream, but immensely interesting.\\"Chambers, et al, 116 The effect of Metcalf's new-found prosperity on the Old Lyme colony was chronicled the following year, when Lillian Baynes Griffin, wife of painter Walter Griffin, wrote in the Hartford Daily Courant, \\"The art colony has steadily grown since the first few painters chose it as a sketching ground, but never before has there been such a sudden demand for every inch of available space as there is this year ... Lyme cows are so busy posing for the Art classes that they have hardly time to be milked ... One explanation of the remarkable jump Lyme has taken is that Willard Metcalf sold in three days $3,000 worth of Lyme landscapes in the St. Botolph Club last winter. This made Lyme landscapes sound like Standard Oil, and with no less enthusiasm than the gold hunters of '49, the picture makers have chosen Lyme as a place in which to swarm.\\"Chambers, et al, 14Scanlan The influence of May Night was particularly strong: \\"Suddenly everyone wanted to paint his own May Night.\\"Chambers, et al, 59 Among the artists painting versions of the theme in 1907 were Will Howe Foote and Metcalf's former student Robert Nisbet,Chambers, et al, 59 who eloped with Metcalf's wife Marguerite in July of that year.KainChambers, et al, 63 May Night was the centerpiece of a 2005 exhibition of Metcalf's works at the Florence Griswold Museum.Kain Concurrently, an eponymously titled song was featured in a musical inspired by Florence Griswold.Kain Notes References * Chambers, Bruce W., et al.

It premiered on Showtime on December 18, 2011. In this episode, Dexter finally confronts the Doomsday Killer, Travis Marshall. Plot Dexter spends the night floating in the waters off Miami and is rescued by a passing migrant boat. Homicide is called to a double murder scene that turns out to be Travis' hideout. Inside, Dexter sees a depiction of the last tableau with his face painted in as the face of The Beast, and defaces the face with a hammer before anyone else can see it. Batista informs Quinn that he has put in for a transfer for Quinn due to his increasing irresponsibility, to which Quinn objects and storms out. Louis asks Masuka if he can have a full-time position at Metro once his internship ends. When Masuka asks him, \\"What about your video game?\\" Louis replies that it \\"just doesn't seem important any more\\" while looking past Masuka at Dexter. Debra tells Dexter he must return to the abandoned church to wrap up forensics. Travis sees that the police have found his hideout, so he retreats to Dexter's apartment. Travis hears Jamie in the home with Harrison. Realizing that Harrison is Dexter's son, Travis decides to use the boy as his sacrificial lamb in his final act to bring about the end of the world. Debra dispatches officers to skyscrapers in downtown Miami on a hunch that this is where the final tableau will be executed. Dexter attends Harrison's Noah's Ark play, after which Travis abducts Harrison. Dexter knows which skyscraper Travis has chosen, and arrives moments before Travis can sacrifice Harrison. Travis releases Harrison when Dexter feigns injecting himself with his tranquilizers. Dexter surprises Travis and beats him unconscious. Homicide arrives after the officer on guard fails to respond via radio and they find him dead with no sign of Travis. Debra rushes into her therapist's office and recounts that Dexter actually said, \\"I love you\\" to her, and decides she wants to tell him she is in love with him. Travis awakens on Dexter's table at the abandoned church and proclaims that he was doing God's work. Deb goes to the church unannounced and sees Dexter kill Travis. Dexter hears someone gasp, looks up and sees his sister, and says \\"Oh God.\\" Reception The season six finale garnered 2.23 million viewers at 9 p.m. and 2.71 million viewers for the night, the series best telecast of the year and highest-rated night. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Out of 15 reviews of the episode indexed by Metacritic, five were negative, six were mixed, and four were positive. Some critics did, however, point out the final scene of the episode for particular praise. IGN reviewer Matt Fowler claimed \\"The Season 6 finale just might give the show a new beginning\\", and praised the episode for the shocking final scene, awarding the episode an 8.5/10 (the second-highest score of the sixth season by IGN reviewers).

It was erected before 1400 to commemorate the Battle of Otterburn, which took place in 1388, and takes its name from Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland whose two sons took part in the battle. The memorial was restored and re-erected in 1777, and again in modern day, to include signage. The Percy Cross is a sandstone memorial which includes a square stepped base, approximately in height and in diameter. The entire battlefield area is designated an Area of High Landscape Value and parts of it are contained within the Northumberland National Park. On 7 January 1988, Percy Cross became a Grade II listed building. History In Armstrong's 1769 map of Northumberland, he marks the spot with a cross, called \\"Battle Stone\\". Another monument, now called Percy's Cross, was erected by Henry Ellison upon the spot where James Douglas, 2nd Earl of Douglas is said to have fallen. ;Battle Stone The original stone measured in length and, by the later 18th century, rather than standing up, it lay in an oblique direction as it was too small for the socket or base in which it was placed. The top of the socket was exposed with stones around it. The spot where it stood was east from the present cross. ;Percy Cross In 1777, Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland wanted to build on the spot some memorial of the battle that was associated with his family. But the proprietor of the land, Henry Ellison, fearing that Percy might attach some claim either to what was put up, or the ground on which it was to stand, declined the proposal, and resolved to erect one himself. Instead of re-building in the spot consecrated by the original stone, Ellison chose another site within view of the highway, so that what he built might be viewable by those who passed by the newly created turnpike road up Redesdale. It is said to have been raised at a \\"trifling expense\\". Architecture The monument is a circular pedestal of rough masonry, about in diameter at the bottom, and more than in height. It tapers to the top. The centre of it includes the old socket which belonged to the previous stone. An old architrave from the kitchen fireplace at Otterburn Hall was inserted into it. The cross section of this stone is . It has a beveled corner along its length, and two small pieces of iron project from a side. On its top is another stone, tapering to a point. The socket is a worn, weather- beaten sandstone, about square and has the appearance of having been in use much longer than any of the other stones.

The game is a crossover between the Pok√©mon and Nobunaga's Ambition video game series. The game was released in Japan on March 17, 2012, in North America on June 18, 2012, and in Europe on July 27, 2012. Gameplay The player, accompanied by an Eevee, travels throughout the befriending Pok√©mon and battling and to conquer and unite the region; Warriors and Warlord Leaders can join the player's party once defeated, allowing the player access to more Pok√©mon. The gameplay is turn-based strategy and is a tactical RPG unlike the main-series Pok√©mon games, with different Pok√©mon capable of using different attacks and means of movement. Warriors and Warlords also have unique battle-changing powers that boost their Pok√©mon's abilities but may only be used once per battle. These effects range from increased attacking power, health restoration, or even temporary invincibility. Battle gameplay of Pok√©mon Conquest, with touch screen on bottom Unlike in the main-series Pok√©mon games, each Pok√©mon is capable of using only one move. This move is determined by the Pok√©mon's species and is usually picked to represent that species; for example, Excadrill uses its trademark move Drill Run. Additionally, only a select fraction of the 649 Pok√©mon that existed at that time of release are available in the game. The main-series capture system is replaced by a minigame where a Warrior attempts to form a link with a wild Pok√©mon by coordinating button presses with a display, reminiscent of Dance Dance Revolution. The main-series leveling system is replaced by a concept called \\"link\\", a percentage which increases to a certain maximum, and reflects that Pok√©mon's battling statistics. Each Warrior has a natural affinity to certain types, which grants an increased maximum link with Pok√©mon of those types. In addition, every Warrior and Warlord has one evolutionary family of Pok√©mon with which they may form a 100%, or perfect, link. In addition certain Warlords can form links with legendary Pok√©mon. A Warlord's costume almost always resembles the appearance of at least one of their \\"perfect link\\" species. Additionally, the main-series evolution system is changed to reflect the removal of Pok√©mon levels. Instead of a Pok√©mon reaching a specific level, they evolve by reaching certain conditions such as reaching a specific link or winning a battle in a specific kingdom. Warlords are also able to evolve by reaching certain conditions, such as achieving a certain link percent with a Pok√©mon. Warlords, other than the player, cannot evolve until after completing the main story. The various Warriors and Warlords in the game are named after figures in Japanese history, with the game's antagonist being a take on the real historical figure Oda Nobunaga. After defeating Nobunaga and completing the main story line, players are able to take on 36 special episodes, each featuring one of the other warlords and having different objectives (such as taking over a portion of Ransei rather than the whole region). They feature smarter AI (with the opposing nations attacking your countries more often), the ability to upgrade the locations within the regions through a bank to find more Pok√©mon or get better items, and to evolve the rest of the Warlords. The episodes often reference real historical events, such as Mitsuhide's betrayal of Nobunaga and Hideyoshi's unification of most of Japan. After the episodes of the 16 senior warlords are completed, a final episode will be unlocked, which is essentially a new game with the main playable character, but including the added features of the post-game episodes. Plot A legend is foretold that the one who unifies all the 17 kingdoms of the will have a chance to encounter the Legendary Pok√©mon who created the Ransei Region. Warriors and Warlords all over the region sought to fulfill the foretold legend, resulting in battles and an end to Ransei's peaceful era. The game initiates off with the player just becoming the Warlord of the kingdom and is met by Oichi. Hideyoshi of the nearby kingdom of sends his warriors to ambush Aurora, only for them to be defeated by player and Oichi. Oichi explains to the player that all of the other kingdoms of Ransei had become aggressive and hostile towards one another, in their own hopes of fulfilling the Ransei Legend. This initiates the player's harrowing journey of unifying other nations, starting with Ignis, hoping to restore peace upon Ransei. After conquering the kingdoms of , and , Oichi explains that Nobunaga, who dwells at the northern part of Ransei, is the main threat of the Ransei Region. After conquering the kingdoms of , , and , Oichi explains that Nobunaga's ambition is to fulfill the Ransei Legend and use Arceus's power to demolish Ransei. After conquering the two kingdoms of and , Oichi hosts a celebration of Shingen and Kenshin's recruitment to the player's army. During the celebration, the player is confronted by Nobunaga, who holds the kingdoms of , , , , , , and under his command. Nobunaga informs the player and Oichi of their foolishness of opposing him and returns to his own kingdom of . Though his servant Ranmaru pleads with Oichi not to oppose him, Nobunaga states he will annihilate anyone who gets in his way. With Nobunaga and his Zekrom defeated, the player had united Ransei, and the Infinity Tower is revealed. Inside, the player's party finds the Mythical Pok√©mon Arceus. After linking with Arceus, the player is confronted again with Nobunaga, now partnered with a shiny Rayquaza, along with Mitsuhide, , Ieyasu, Ranmaru, and Hideyoshi for a final battle. After being defeated, Nobunaga reveals his true intentions to bring peace to Ransei by destroying Arceus as it is the cause of the conflict. However, seeing the player unaffected by being linked to Arceus, and as the Pok√©mon takes its leave, Nobunaga relents as Ransei's kingdoms are restored to their proper owners and a system in the region is established. Development Pok√©mon + Nobunaga's Ambition was first revealed at the Shueisha's \\"Jump Festa\\" anime and manga event on December 17, 2011. Nintendo and Tecmo Koei announced the game during the event and announced its 2012 release. The Pok√©mon Company announced a live streaming event that would be used to reveal information to consumers in Japan, and it took place on January 19, 2012.

Asymmetrical distribution of continents The ITCZ would be expected to overlie the geographic equator according to symmetric solar radiation. However, the ITCZ is mostly perennial in the northern hemisphere and in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. It was originally explained by the asymmetrical distribution of continents. However, the distribution of land and ocean is severely asymmetric in the Indian Ocean, yet the ITCZ moves back and forth there between the southern and northern hemispheres. Continents surround the Indian Ocean and monsoons prevail. Where the thermocline is deeper indicates that there is a weaker interaction between atmosphere and ocean. Due to the relatively small scale and deep thermocline in the Indian Ocean, there will be less asymmetric effects. In the middle latitude Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, because of the large scale easterly wind system and the western continents boundaries, the thermocline is definitely shallower in eastern part. Thus, the asymmetry is obvious in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Ocean. There are two factors that are acknowledged by oceanographers and meteorologists: the interactions between ocean and atmosphere and the geometries of the continents. Asymmetric SST Distribution According to observations, the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) of ITCZ in the Northern Hemisphere is higher than the same latitude in the Southern Hemisphere. The asymmetry of ITCZ is triggered by the asymmetric SST distribution, which has been verified by General Circulation Model (GCM).Philander, S.G.H., et al.,1996,The role of low-level stratus clouds in keeping the ITCZ mostly north of the equator. J. Clim., 9, 2958-2972. Wind-evaporation-SST mechanism What is more, because the Cross Equator SST Gradient (CESG) is southward, the cross equator northward wind, which decelerates trade winds north of the equator and accelerates those south of the equator due to Coriolis force, is originated. Thus the evaporation of the northern tropics is weakened, thereby cooling down the northern tropicalSST slightly. Vice versa, SST of southern part to the equator is much reduced. Therefore, SST of northern tropical is much higher, and higher than southern tropical, by which increases the CESG. As a result, this positive feedback, which is defined as Wind-Evaporation-SST (WES) will intensify this process. Explanation of Asymmetric SST Distribution In this way, the WES keeps the ITCZ north of the equator. And the precondition of WES is the asymmetric distribution of SST, and WES also strengthens this process. According to the observation of equatorial upwelling and obvious asymmetry of the ITCZ in the Pacific and Atlantic, it is inferred that it is the equatorial upwelling that prevents the ITCZ being created at the equator. To explain this simply, upwelling brings cold water to the surface, which will cool the above atmosphere and make it stable because of relative high air density due to low temperature. Thus, this area of the equator is different compared to the strong vertical convection and abundant precipitation of the ITCZ. As a result, the SST is latitudinally asymmetric.

It was broadcast over KTTV, which at the time was the Los Angeles affiliate of CBS (the network would start KNXT in 1951). In 1949, comedian Ed Wynn invited Keaton to appear on his CBS Television comedy-variety show, The Ed Wynn Show, which was televised live on the West Coast. Kinescopes were made for distribution of the programs to other parts of the country, since there was no transcontinental coaxial cable until September 1951. Reaction was strong enough for a local Los Angeles station to offer Keaton his own show, also broadcast live, in 1950. The Buster Keaton Comedy Show was Keaton's second foray into the new medium of television. It followed the 1949 one-off. Broadcast live, no record of that first program remains and it was not seen by viewers outside California, as it was not filmed in kinescope nor was there a coaxial cable linking the coasts at that time. Life with Buster Keaton (Date unknown, probably 1950 or 1951) was an attempt to recreate the first series on film, allowing the program to be broadcast nationwide. The series benefited from a company of veteran actors, including Marcia Mae Jones as the ingenue, Iris Adrian, Dick Wessel, Fuzzy Knight, Dub Taylor, Philip Van Zandt, and his silent-era contemporaries Harold Goodwin, Hank Mann, and stuntman Harvey Parry. Buster Keaton's wife Eleanor also was seen in the series (notably as Juliet to Buster's Romeo in a little-theater vignette). Keaton said that he canceled the filmed series himself, because he was unable to create enough fresh material to produce a new show each week. Several episodes from the show were assembled into a feature-length film that was released theatrically in the United Kingdom as The Misadventures of Buster Keaton. Lack of Information Unfortunately, there's an absurd lack of info on this show or shows. It's unknown how many tv shows Buster Keaton starred in, how many episodes were released, what those episodes were called, what episode number they were, what year episodes were released in, etc. The most info we have is that there's a handful of available episodes from probably more than one show and a movie made which compiles footage from at least three episodes. These episodes have had several different titles attributed to them. It's entirely possible that information on The Buster Keaton Show, The Buster Keaton Comedy Show, and Life with Buster Keaton is falsely attributed to one show when it correctly is about another. The Buster Keaton Comedy Show especially lacks knowledge. Some sources have listed Life with Buster Keaton as having started airing in 1951, however, The Misadventures of Buster Keaton is known to have been released in 1950. It's possible that the footage was derived from then unaired episodes, but this is unconfirmed.

At least 14 protestors were killed by police in the oil town of Zhanaozen as they clashed with police on the country's Independence Day, with unrest spreading to other towns in the oil- rich oblys, or region. The massacre was a stark illustration of the country's poor human rights record under President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Zhanaozen San Francisco, USA protesting against the government's response to the riots on 18 December 2011. Zhanaozen has been described as \\"a one-industry town...centered on the ageing oilfield of Ozen\\". In May 2011, workers from the Ozenmunaigas oil field went on strike for unpaid danger money, higher wages and better working conditions. The strike was declared illegal by local courts and the state oil company fired nearly 1000 employees. Some of the sacked workers then started a round-the-clock occupation of the town square in protest, demanding better union representation and recognition of workers' rights. The strike continued for months without official interference. According to Radio Free Europe, the protest expanded, \\"with demonstrators furious over what they saw as a stranglehold on collective bargaining and labor rights by the government.\\" In mid-December, some workers in the square began calling for the right to form independent political parties free of the government's influence. 16 December 2011 On 16 December, there were clashes between protesters and police who were attempting to evict them from the square in preparation for an Independence Day celebration. Activists claimed security officers opened fire on unarmed demonstrators. Authorities claimed that \\"bandits\\" infiltrated the protesters and began the riots first, producing video to support their version of events. Eleven were killed, according to government officials, though opposition sources put the death toll in the dozens. General Prosecutor Askhat Daulbayev claimed that \\"civilians, who had gathered in the main square to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the country's independence, were attacked by a group of hooligans\\". The Kazakh opposition TV channel K-Plus showed the beginning of the unrest, as men purported to be oil workers ran on the stage, tipped over the speakers and pushed around civilians before police arrived. In the disturbances which followed, local government offices, a hotel and an office of the state oil company were set on fire, according to Daulbayev. Eighty-six people were injured in the clashes, according to officials. Due to a shortage of hospital beds in Zhanaozen, many were taken to be treated in Aktau, around 150 km away. Testimony of victims and witnesses Observers described people \\"running and falling, running and falling\\" and police \\"showering the people with bullets.\\" One witness said: \\"Usually it's only in the movies that you see lines of soldiers with their weapons at the ready....When you see them firsthand, it's a completely different experience. Especially when what you're seeing are OMON riot police, dressed all in black, building a barricade and rapping their clubs against their shields.\\" Response On the night of 16 December, police in Almaty took opposition activists protesting against the deaths in Zhanaozen into custody. Workers on the Kalamkas and Karazhanbas oilfields went on strike in response to the events at Zhanaozen. On 17 December, a group of men in the village of Shetpe near Aktau blocked and damaged a railway line. Unrest was also reported in other cities and towns in the oblast. President Nazarbayev visited Mangystau Region several days after the initial eruption of unrest. He said on December 22, while in Aktau, that he would fire his son-in-law, Timur Kulibayev, over his handling of the crisis. Kulibayev was head of Kazakhstan's sovereign-wealth fund, Samruk- Kazyna, which manages many state assets, including the energy company KazMunaiGas. Nazarbayev fired several local officials to punish them for their roles in the massacre. Also, police officers charged with firing at protesters were arrested. In addition, the regional governor resigned, and Nazarbayev replaced him with a former minister of the interior. Nazarbayev also fired the heads of the national oil company, Kazmunaigaz (KMG) and its production unit. On December 26, he carried out his promise to dismiss his son-in-law, who had been widely viewed as his likely successor. Nazarbayev also subjected Zhanaozen to a 20-day curfew and state of emergency. Investigations On 9 January 2012, it was reported that six Kazakh government bodies, \\"including the public commission, the government's body composed of civilian volunteers and officials, and several others set up by the authorities,\\" were conducting investigations of the Zhanaozen massacre. Kazakh authorities claimed that they had asked the UN to participate in the investigations, but a spokesman for the office of the secretary-general said that the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights had not \\"been invited or requested to help investigate.\\" A trial of protesters began in Aktau in May 2012. Many defendants complained that they had been physically abused, and some even tortured, while in police custody and during interrogation. Some witnesses also claimed they had been threatened by police into giving false testimony. Several opposition figures were arrested in connection with the protests, including journalist Janbolat Mamai, politician Serik Sapargali, Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan leader Vladimir Kozlov, and theater director Bolat Atabaev. Human Rights Watch protested the arrests, stating that \\"If the Kazakh authorities can prove these political activists were involved in the violence in Zhanaozen, they shouldn't need to resort to using vague and undefined criminal allegations to imprison them ... The 'inciting social discord' charge should be dropped immediately and those against whom there is no evidence of any violent activity should be released from custody.\\" Anti-censorship group ARTICLE 19 described the charges as \\"spurious\\" and \\"alarming\\", warning that the arrests of Atabaev and others would have \\"a chilling effect on freedom of expression in Kazakhstan\\". Amnesty International described the charge against Atabaev as \\"trumped-up\\", designating him a prisoner of conscience, \\"detained solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression\\". Two further trials of security officials are currently taking place. In one, 5 police officers are accused of shooting demonstrators. In the other, the former chief of a police detention centre in Zhanaozen is being prosecuted in relation to the death of a suspect who was allegedly beaten to death. In the media Tony Blair gave damage- limitation advice to Nazarbayev and helped him craft a response which was later delivered before Western media. On July 2015 Kazakh-Russian band Nazarbayev Terror Machine released their first album \\"Zhanaozen\\" dedicated to the massacre.

Zangeja by caste, Muslim by religion and a Sufi by practice, he was considered to be the great saint poet Kabir reborn in Sindh. Rohal was the progenitor of the famous kandri sharif tribes of the poets and man of piety. He reached the heights of Sufism through blessings of Sufi-sage Shah Inayat, the famous martyr. In his poetry he expresses his message of giving up egoism and hatred and following the cult of love. Sufi Rohal was first person to fuse vedantic elements with Muslim Sufi concepts. Now his shrine at Kandri Sharif Taluka Rohri District Sukkur.  Birth  Sufi Rohal Faqir, son of Shahu Faqir Zangejo is believed to have been born in 1734 A.D. at \\"Padma Bhit\\" near Umerkot, Sindh. According to another tradition, he was born in 1124 (Hijri) at the village which was later called \\"Rohal Wai\\". This village no longer exists. He had two brothers, Sultan and Mayvo.  Attachment with court  Sufi Rohal's father Shaho Faqir was attached with the court of Kalhora dynasty ruler Miyan Din Muhammad (Died 1111 Hijri). He was among the advisor of Miyan Din Muhammad. Recognizing the services of his father, he was entered in official service. With the passage of time, he managed to reach close to royal court of Kalhora ruler, Miyan Ghulam Shah Kalhoro and he was made the minister of royal treasury in 1762 which continued till 1782 Hijri. Sufi Rohal Faqir instead of indulging himself into the pleasures of official service, he would ponder and desire for the ultimate truth that he was missing very dearly from his life. His service tenure was full of honesty and trust that may be the reason of winning the trust of court. He never left side of sincerity and dedication to his official job. In 1772 A.D. when Miyan Ghulam Ali Shah Kalhoro died and his son Miyan Sarfraz Kalhoro took up the office. Sufi Rohal, very soon, realised the reality of transitory world and gave resignation from his job. Though he was insisted by Miyan Sarfraz to stay in his service because of unmatched and dedicated service, this time Sufi Rohal made up his mind to seek the truth and move in the journey towards Beloved.  Spiritual journey  From then on, he started searching for spiritual guide. He quest took him to Jhok Sharif (Miranpur) in District Thatta at the moment, where he found his spiritual guru in form of Sufi Izatullah Shah Sufi-ul- Qadri. He was entered into the discipleship and he quenched his spiritual thirst. It is said that during his stay at Jhok Sharif, he performed secluded meditative worship. After his return, there was a sea change in his life. Now he had turned into a pure practising Sufi.  Marriage  Sufi Rohal married twice in his life. From first marriage, he had two sons: (1) Shahu Faqir (2) Ghulam Ali Faqir. In second marriage, Sufi Murad Faqir, a close relative of Rohal Faqir gave him the hand of his sister. From this marriage, (1) Sufi Khuda Bux and (2) Sufi Darya Khan were born.  Travels  Sufi Rohal Faqir travelled most of his time in life. It is said that after freeing himself from service of finance minister, he was appointed as ambassador. In this position, he travelled to Jaisalmir, Jodhpur, Baikanir and some other far off places of current India. Though his mother tongue was Seraiki, while travelling to the desert of Thar, he learnt and mastered himself in Dhatki, Marwari and Hindi.  Meeting Maharaja Bijai Singh  During his travels as ambassador, he preached the divine message of mysticism to Hindu rajas and people. Sufi Rohal Faqir met Mahraja Bijay Singh at Jodhpur where he wrote Hindi books of poetry in form of conversation between Guru and disciple. Sufi Rohal faqir stayed at Jodhpur for one month and seven days. During his stays, he had lengthy discussion with pandits (Hindu holy priests), black magicians, sages of Jodhpur in the presence of Maharaja. Maharaja wanted to test and measure the stature and spiritual power of Sufi Rohal Faqir. Maharaja was amazed at the wealth of knowledge Sufi Rohal possessed. So much so that, he became disciple of Sufi Rohal and asked him to stay at palace as royal as long as he wanted. Sufi Rohal turned down this generous offer and came back to Sindh.  Renunciation of World  Very soon he bid farewell to ambassador duties and initiated the search of Lord. His renunciation from the materialistic world was due to immense love for his creator. Because of this, a salik (traveler of Sufi path) recognised his self to achieve the ultimate aim of his life. According to Dr. Nabi Bux Baloch, \\"Rohal was the first poet in Sindh who raised the slogan of \\"I am the One\\" after being influenced by the philosophy of Hum-o-oost (All is He)\\".  Companionship with Murad Faqir  A very close relative of Sufi Rohal Faqir, Sufi Murad Faqir happened to be the first person who was influenced by his spiritual teaching. Murad Faqir also took the same path and name of his own. Murad Faqir was ten years younger than Rohal faqir. After the end of Kalhora rule, they both along with their family members migrated to Kotli in District Khairpur. It is a rugged, hilly region where they step up their houses. Sufi Murad faqir died in 1796 in Kotli District Khairpur due to some illness.  Arrival at Kandiri  After his life long companion death, Sufi Rohal did not feel like living at Kotli. Very soon, he migrated from there and travelled west ward. While travelling he was stopped by a thorny bush in which his clothes got stuck. It was a deserted place surrounded by wild thorny bushes. At that time remembered the words of his spiritual guide Sufi Izatullah Shah \\"Keep moving until you are stopped by something and that will be your place of residence\\". Sufi Rohal told his family to start making arrangements for setting up permanent residence. From then on, that area started to be called \\"Kandiri\\". Sufi Rohal lived his remaining years of his life in Kandiri.  Death  Sufi Rohal Faqir died at the age of 70 in the year 1804 A.D. He was buried in Kandiri, District Khairpur.  Urs (Annual Fair)  His annual Urs (fair) is celebrated by thousands of disciples from Thar, Rahim Yar Khan, Bahawalpur and surrounding areas. During the celebrations, people come to pay homage and distribute their offer in the honour and respect of this great Sufi poet and saint. Moreover, his poetry is sung by the devotees with love and affection. Presently the Gadi Nasheen (Heir of Sufi throne) is Sufi Gulam Rasool Faqeer, sixth person from the progeny of Sufi Rohal Faqir.  Poetry  Sufi Rohal Faqir was Hindu, Sindhi, Persian and Seraiki poet. Today, after Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, his name is taken as one of the great Sufi poet of Sindh. He authored many songs that are very much popular among people especially among the Hindus. Sufi Rohal has four books to his credit. * Man Parbodh () * Udhbhit Granth () * Surab Giyan () * Agham Warta () References Sindhi-language poets Sufi poets Sindhi people Sindhi Sufi saints Sufism in Sindh People from Sukkur District 1734 births 1804 deaths ","title":"Rohal Faqir"},{"id":"34088764","text":"David Plummer may refer to: * David Plummer (musician), English musician and author of children's books and music * David Plummer (swimmer) (born 1985), American backstroke swimmer * David Plummer (programmer), (born 1968), American/Canadian entrepreneur and programmer, author of Task Manager in Windows, Space Cadet pinball Windows NT port, and more.

The 190 acre plantation grew to encompass 650 acres located just south of the Dill's Gap on the northern end of the South Mountain range between what is Cumberland County and York County.Dill, Rosalie Jones.

Matthew Dill's son James Dill inherited the property after his father's death in 1742 and expanded on his father's business. James Dill's son, John Dill, was transferred 393 acres of the 650 acre plantation in 1784. John Dill later constructed the stone Tavern in 1794 to replace the old tavern that was probably made of wood. John Dill expanded production on the plantation to have a stable for herders and drovers moving livestock, two log barns, a granary, bakehouse, and spring house including improved lodging accommodations for travelers. The property was deeded to Leonard Eichelberger in 1800 that later expanded and tripled the size of the original stone Tavern built by John Dill and continued to run the distillery and tavern as well as his wagon building and wheelwright business on the plantation.Deed Transfer: Dill, John to Eichelberger, Leonard, p. 130, Feb. 16 1801.

Had the neighborhood actually been established in 1884-5, Peters Park would have been Atlanta's first garden suburb, preceding Inman Park, the first to feature winding roads, a lake and a planted boulevard. Organizers The land was owned by Atlanta founder and railroad man Richard Peters, and the \\"model suburban town\\", as it was called then, was planned by Hannibal Kimball, who was behind the once-iconic Kimball House hotel and the 1881 International Cotton Exposition. Nathan Franklin Barrett was the nationally renowned landscape architect. Planned features At one point the project was described as encompassing , out of which 142 would be lots, 48 would streets and , parks. (Other sources describe the project as . Peters Park would be accessible via the Peachtree or Marietta Street horsecar lines of the Atlanta Street Railway Company. Lots were improved by the land development company, a novelty for Atlanta at the time. By May 1885, $50,000 had been spent improving the neighborhood in anticipation of lot sales. Failure The project failed ‚Äî few lots were sold. Reasons attributed were the walking distance from the horsecar lines, high prices, and the onerous restrictions as to what could be built on the lots. Destination of land In 1887 Peters offered to donate fronting on North Avenue and Cherry Street as the site of the Technological School, which would become Georgia Tech, as an alternative to Boulevard and Grant Park, the two other sites being considered for the school. The offer was accepted, and Peters was able to sell an additional adjacent of prime land for use by the school. The remainder of the Peters Park land would become the Hemphill Avenue neighborhood, which would be razed in the late 1960s and become part of the Georgia Tech campus.

TAV can be discussed in different time scales: seasonal (annual cycle) and interannual. tav can be discussed in different time scales: seasonal (annual cycle) and interannual.and external effects. Annual Cycle Seasonal variability is the dominant time scale of TAV, which is due to the seasonal march of the sun. This seasonal variability is related to the movement of intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ),which is the convergent zone of trade winds from south and north near the equator. It has strong vertical convection resulting to a redundant participation band and weak winds. The mean location of the ITCZ over the Atlantic Ocean is 5~10 degrees north of the geographical equator. All this asymmetric of ITCZ is the ultimate cause of the annual cycle in equatorial sea surface temperature (SST) in Atlantic by maintaining southerly cross-equatorial winds that intensify in boreal summer/fall and relax in boreal spring. From March to April, during which the temperature of the equator reaches maximum, winds are weakest and the sun shines directly over the equator. So, SST is uniformly warm near the equator, which makes the ITCZ really sensitive to even small disturbance of SST and explains the relaxation of cross-equator winds in spring. From July to September, during which the temperature of the equator reaches its minimum, ITCZ reaches its northernmost location, which explains the intensification of cross-equator winds. It can be seen that the process of cooling takes 3 months while that of warming takes 7 months, which are asymmetric. This seasonal asymmetry is due to influence of seasonal continental monsoon. Because of the narrow width of Atlantic, continental monsoon has a much more important influence on its variation compared to the wide Pacific Ocean, whose leading factor is air-sea interaction. Interannual Cycle For interannual, there is one mode called Atlantic Ni√±o, of which periodicity varies. During the Atlantic Nino event, eastern area of Atlantic will appear warm SST anomalies accompanying a relaxation of trade winds.Merle, J. Annual and interannual variability of temperature in the eastern equatorial Atlantic Ocean ‚Äì hypothesis of an Atlantic El Nino.Oceanol. Acta, 3, 209-220,1980 This mechanism, which is known as Bjerknes Feedback, is similar to El Ni√±o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ‚ÄúOn interannual and longer timescales, no single mode seems to dominate. Instead, several mechanisms are responsible for tropical Atlantic variability. On the equator, both observational and modeling studies indicate that there is a Bjerknes-type air-sea coupled mode arising from the interaction of the equatorial zonal SST gradient, ITCZ convection, zonal wind, and thermocline depth.‚Äù  References  Atlantic Ocean Tropical meteorology ","title":"Tropical Atlantic Variability"},{"id":"34088968","text":"or is an uninhabited island in Kv√¶nangen Municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway.

The regiment was raised in September 1914, and assigned to the 3rd Light Horse Brigade. The regiment fought against the forces of the Ottoman Empire, in Egypt, at Gallipoli, on the Sinai Peninsula, and in Palestine and Jordan. After the armistice the regiment eventually returned to Australia in March 1919. For its role in the war the regiment was awarded fifteen battle honours. During the inter-war years, the 8th Light Horse was re-raised as a part-time unit based in the Indi region of northern Victoria. It was later converted to a divisional cavalry regiment during the Second World War but was disbanded in 1944 without having been deployed overseas. Formation C Squadron 8th Light Horse Regiment Broadmeadows Camp 1915 State Library Victoria Accession no: H82.32 The 8th Light Horse Regiment was raised at Victoria in September 1914, originally as the 6th Light Horse Regiment, but following a reorganisation in October was renumbered the 8th Regiment, and comprised twenty-five officers and 497 other ranks serving in three squadrons, each of six troops.Gullet 1941, p. 54. Each troop was divided into eight sections, of four men each. In action one man of each section, was nominated as a horse holder reducing the regiments rifle strength by a quarter.Horner and Williams, Chapter: Setting up the Light Horse Once formed the regiment was assigned to the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, serving alongside the 9th and 10th Light Horse Regiments. All Australian Light Horse regiments used cavalry unit designations, but were mounted rifles armed with rifles, not swords or lances,Gullett 1941, p. 29. and mounted exclusively on the Australian Waler horse.Gullett 1941, p. 38. Operational history Lieutenant Carthew 8th Light Horse Regiment, Egypt Gallipoli In December 1914, the 8th Light Horse Regiment left Sydney for Egypt, arriving on the 1 February 1915. When the Australian infantry units were dispatched to Gallipoli, it was thought the terrain was unsuitable for mounted troops, and the light horse regiments remained in Egypt. However, heavy casualties amongst the Australian infantry battalions resulted in the deployment of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade as reinforcements in May 1915. On arrival, the regiment was attached to the New Zealand and Australian Division. The regiment was heavily involved in the Battle of the Nek, suffering severe casualties including its commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander White, who was killed leading the first wave. The regiment were mostly used in a defensive role, until being withdrawn back to Egypt in December 1915. Sinai and Palestine Campaign 8th Light Horse at Romani On their arrival back in Egypt, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was assigned to the newly raised ANZAC Mounted Division, and at first given responsibility for the defence of the Suez Canal. Following their minor role in The Jifjafa Raid, the regiment did not take part in any of the early battles in the Sinai, but were instead used to patrol the large open area of the region, until the British advance into Palestine. In December 1916, they took part in the Battle of Maghdaba. The regiment and brigade were then transferred to the Imperial Mounted Division, later renamed the Australian Mounted Division. Their next battles were the unsuccessful First and Second Battles of Gaza, then the successful Battle of Beersheba in October 1917. With the Ottoman Empire forces in retreat, the regiment was part of the pursuit into Palestine, resulting in the capture of Jerusalem in 1917, and raid across the River Jordan in 1918, at Amman and Es Salt. The regiment then took part in the capture of Tiberius and Sa'sa' in September, and entered Damascus on 1 October. The war in the Middle East ended shortly afterwards when the armistice of Mudros was signed in October 1918. Afterwards, the regiment returned to Egypt to assist in putting down a revolt, before sailing for Australia in July 1919. The war cost the regiment almost 200 per cent casualties, 302 killed and 675 wounded. Perpetuation In 1921, the decision was made to perpetuate the honours and traditions of the AIF by reorganising the units of the Citizens Force to replicate the numerical designations of their related AIF units.Grey 2008, p. 125. As a result, the 8th Light Horse was re-raised as a part-time unit based in the Indi region of northern Victoria within the 3rd Military District; in doing so, it assumed a complicated lineage. This included the 8th (Indi) Light Horse that had been formed in 1918 by the re-designation of the 16th (Indi) Light Horse. The 16th traced its existence back to the 8th Australian Light Horse Regiment (Victorian Mounted Rifles), which had been formed in 1903 as part of the amalgamation of Australia's colonial forces into the Australian Army after Federation.Festberg 1972, p. 44. The unit remained on the order of battle throughout the inter-war years, and upon the outbreak of the Second World War, the regiment formed part of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, within the 2nd Cavalry Division. On 1 December 1941, the regiment was re-designated the 8th Reconnaissance Battalion (Indi Light Horse). It was again re-designated in July 1942, assuming the title of the 8th Divisional Cavalry Regiment. A unit had previously been raised with this designation when the 8th Division had been formed; however, the decision to deploy the 8th to Malaya and the islands to Australia's north in early to mid-1941 had resulted in that unit being deemed unnecessary for the 8th Division's establishment and it had subsequently been re-designated the 9th Divisional Cavalry Regiment and reassigned to the 9th Division.Handel 2003, p. 148. The regiment was mobilised for war service and deployed to the Northern Territory to bolster the garrison there. It was eventually gazetted as an AIF unit in 1943, meaning that it could serve in an operational capacity outside of Australian territory if required,Finlayson 2012, p. 199. but was eventually deemed surplus to requirements as the Australian Army was partially demobilised in the later war years, and was disbanded in March 1944 at Watsonia, Victoria. In the post war period, the regiment was re-raised as an amalgamated unit, designated the 8th/13th Victorian Mounted Rifles, which remained in existence until 1991-92.Finlayson 2012, p. 323.

Traditionally the Maroons made their own clothing, using cotton as the raw material, which they either grew themselves or stole from plantation cotton fields. They most likely spun threads in the same way as the Amerindians, using a spindle at foot height, then wove the threads into cloth on a simple loom. A woman would traditionally wear a panga but no top, and this is still customary in some villages. However, in villages that are frequented by tourists the women now generally wear a top.

The train derailed and crushed three people to death.The Times; 14 December 1836. Description of the accident Background The Newcastle & Carlisle Railway opened in sections from March 1835, with the whole line opening to passengers on 18 June 1838. Lord Carlisle owned extensive coal- mining interests in Cumberland and had built and operated the Brampton Railway connecting his coal mines from the late 1700s. The new Newcastle and Carlisle Railway crossed and connected with the Brampton Railway at Brampton Junction. The site Six or eight miles westwards along the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway from Brampton Junction is the village of Wetheral and a few hundred yards before Wetheral railway station is the hamlet of Great Corby. At Great Corby there was a siding owned by Lord Carlisle that led to coal staithes (where the track was supported above ground level to allow easy transfer of coal from rail wagons into road wagons). The siding was entered from the Brampton Junction (i.e. Newcastle) direction and when travelling from that direction there is quite a steep gradient down to the siding. The operation of the point for the siding was the responsibility of an employee of Lord Carlisle (and not the railway company), and part of the responsibility was to make sure the point was left set for the main line, not the siding, once trains had passed onto and away from the siding.In the very early days of railways the enormity of the risk of potentially catastrophic accidents was not fully appreciated. At the time, the task of operating a point on the main- line giving access onto a siding was broadly considered equivalent to opening a field gate to allow a horse and cart to pass through ‚Äì a task that could quite properly be given to an unsupervised and relatively junior person. Approach of the train At about 4pm on Saturday 3 December 1836, a train was travelling westwards towards Carlisle, drawn by the locomotive SAMSON, with 26 passengers aboard plus a heavy load of goods. About half a mile before the siding the driver shut the locomotive regulator and the train descended the gradient. On reaching a bridge just before the siding, the train driver saw a man upon the line and signalled to him to get out of the way. The driver then saw that the points were set for the siding rather than the main line. He set the locomotive into reverse and he and the fireman leaped off. Because of the downward gradient the train carried on its way unchecked. Collision The train ran onto the siding and onto the staithes. Six empty coal wagons, which were standing there, were struck and driven off the track. The stone pillars of the staithes that supported the track gave way, and the engine fell about eight feet, destroying the whole framework of the staithes. The tender followed. Next to the locomotive was an open horse wagon laden with corn that fell but landed upright. The horse wagon was followed by a laden freight wagon that fell upon the horse wagon. Casualties Although one of the passenger carriages was badly damaged, all the carriages stopped just before falling and stayed upon the tracks. All the passengers escaped without injury except one, who had his hand jammed between broken timbers. Unfortunately, a man named Henry Johnston, a dyer from Warwick on Eden, was on the staithes, and did not have time to get out of the way. He was fatally injured and died the next morning. Two boys, named Matthew Potts and John Kelsay, aged 14 and 16, had apparently stowed away in the horse wagon and were found crushed to death underneath the wagon that had fallen upon it. It was reported that the head of John Kelsay, \\"...was crushed quite flat, and presented a frightful spectacle\\". Coroner's Inquest An inquest was held on Monday 12 December 1836.

With over 200,000 visitors per year it is the most popular castle or schloss in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.Ostsee-Zeitung, 12 April 2008, p. 6  Location  The lodge lies in the middle of the forested Granitz ridge, which covers an area of about and has been part of the Southeast R√ºgen Biosphere Reserve since 1991. The name Tempelberg given to the highest hill in the Granitz comes from the 18th century, when a small hexagonal belvedere stood on the site of the present schloss. The quickest way to get there is from the Baltic seaside resort of Binz on the R√ºgen Light Railway or the Hunting Lodge Express (Jagdschlossexpress).  History  The hunting lodge (Jagdschloss) was built on the highest hill in East R√ºgen, the high Tempelberg, in the years 1838 to 1846 by order of Prince Wilhelm Malte I of Putbus, based on a design by Berlin architect, Johann Gottfried Steinmeyer in the style of the North Italian Renaissance castellos. It was once a popular holiday destination for European nobility and prominent people; for example, Frederick William IV, Christian VIII, Otto von Bismarck, Elizabeth von Arnim, and Johann Jacob Gr√ºmbke numbered amongst its visitors. The lodge was owned by the von Putbus family until 1944 and passed into Nazi hands on the imprisonment of Malte von Putbus. The family was finally dispossessed as part of the East German land reforms and the castle remains today in state hands. After the end of the Second World War many of the furnishings were lost or stolen, several works of art were taken to the Berlin Art Depot, the agency for the administration of Soviet assets in Germany, and transferred in 1953 to the state museums in Berlin. Attempts by the grandson of Malte zu Putbus, Franz zu Putbus, to get the family seat returned failed in court. The building is used today as a museum. The castle was renovated at the beginning of the 21st century at a cost of 7.9 million euros.  Design  The two-storey, plastered, brick edifice has a rectangular ground plan and four small corner towers. In the centre of the building in the old courtroom there is a 38-metre-high central tower, erected later based on plans by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. Inside is a cantilevered circular staircase with 154 cast-iron steps. The static forces of the heavy iron staircase are entirely absorbed by the side walls; because it virtually clamped to the tower. From the observation platform, 145 metres above sea level (NN), on the roof of the tower, there is a panoramic view in all directions, especially over the south and east of R√ºgen. In clear visibility the island of Usedom may be seen.  Exhibitions  Old hunting rifles are displayed in the \\"Stags of the World\\" (Hirsche der Welt) exhibition as well as furniture from the 19th century. In addition there are temporary exhibitions, for example of paintings. Under the direction of experts from the Pomeranian State Museum at Greifswald a permanent exhibition about Prince Malte I zu Putbus and his castle-building project has been created.

The aircraft is made from bolted-together aluminum tubing. Its span wing is supported by cables attached to an inverted \\"V\\" kingpost. The control system is three-axis, with roll controlled by spoilers, using a side stick and pitch and yaw controlled by ruddervators. The pilot is accommodated on an open seat without a windshield. The landing gear features a steerable nose wheel and suspension on all three wheels. The Cuyuna 430 engine of is mounted under the wing and drives the pusher propeller through an extension shaft. Construction time from the factory-supplied assembly kit was estimated at 30 hours. The aircraft can be disassembled and stored in a bag suitable for car-top ground transportation. Operational history A number of Sunbursts suffered structural failures that resulted in fatal accidents. The cause was traced to cable attachment brackets that were made with rough holes that over time in service sawed through the cable thimbles and caused the flight cables to break. This was addressed by replacing the brackets. In service the propeller extension shaft suffered from vibration issues that caused failures of the engine output shaft. This was addressed by the use of a vibration dampening shaft coupler made from rubber.

It contains a symbiont, the cyanobacterium Nostoc commune. It reproduces when pieces of the thallus break off, or when isidia, soredia, and apothecia are produced. It is tolerant of desiccation, shrinking when dry and swelling up when water is present. This lichen is terricolous, growing on the soil surface. It is an indicator of basic soils, and is often found on gypsum-rich and other calcareous soils. It is a common component of cryptobiotic soil crusts, for example, in the dry regions of the western United States. It fixes nitrogen, increasing the nitrogen levels in the soil.

Since 1958 he had held teaching positions at the University of Florida, Cooper Union, Pratt Institute, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College. At Dartmouth, Boghosian was a member of the art faculty from 1968 to 1995. He was awarded an endowed position as the George Frederick Jewett Professor of Art in 1982. Boghosian retired from Dartmouth in 1995 and had since continued his work as a practicing artist up until his death. Early life The son of Armenian immigrants, Boghosian was born and raised in New Britain, Connecticut. His father was a cobbler who later worked for Stanley Tools (now Stanley Black & Decker). Boghosian's early schooling was traditional although he benefited from classes taught by the poet Constance Carrier, who introduced him to the world of literature. Boghosian served in the U.S. Navy, during World War II. Returning to the U.S in 1946 he was able to attend college on the G.I. Bill. Boghosian was then invited by Josef Albers to attend Yale University (1956‚Äì59), along with Irving Petlin, Boghosian had already received a number of accolades as well as a Fulbright Grant for Painting in Italy (1953) and in 1966, he was artist in residence at the American Academy in Rome.http://www.aarome.org/search/node/Varujan%20Boghosian He was a 1985 Guggenheim fellow.http://www.gf.org/fellows/1480-varujan-yegan- boghosian He has taught at The Cooper Union (1959‚Äì64), Yale University (1962‚Äì64), Brown and Dartmouth College (1968‚Äì96). Art and influences Varujan Boghosian \\"Studies for Orpheus\\" at the Stable Gallery, 1963. Boghosian showed with the legendary Stable Gallery, founded by Eleanor Ward, consistently between 1963 and 1966. At this time, the Stable Gallery showcased various young and emerging artists including: Joseph Cornell, Alex Katz, Marisol Escobar, Joan Mitchell, Isamu Noguchi, Cy Twombly, Robert Rauschenberg, and Larry Rivers as well as Andy Warhol's first one-man show. The unorthodox and experimental spirit of this time has remained with Boghosian and informed his developing relationship with the appropriation of everyday objects and their subsequent plastic manipulations. In 1968, Boghosian began to exhibit with the historic Cordier & Ekstrom Gallery, Duchamp's dealer in America. It was an ideal fit for Boghosian, as Arne Ekstrom's distinctive style favored the union of art and literature. Cordier & Ekstrom put on far-reaching shows that gave the same attention to world- renowned artists as it did to those who were just emerging. Morris Louis and Isamu Noguchi were some of the artists who frequented the gallery and it was where Romare Bearden honed his style. The gallery's circulating exhibition roster included such prominent names as Dubuffet, Matisse, Saul Steinberg, and Magritte. Boghosian developed a long-standing relationship with Arne Ekstrom and exhibited with the gallery well into the late 1980s. Boghosian's art draws inspiration from a variety of sources including literature, art, history and music. Allusions to myth and poetry pervade his work. Explorations of the myths of Orpheus and Eurydice, for instance, have been a central and continuous theme throughout his career. Closely linked to this fascination with classical myth is Boghosian's recurring use of symbols such as swans and serpents, both of which are rooted in a strong tradition of cross-cultural mythology. Building upon the traditions of Surrealism and Dada Boghosian's assemblages and collages playfully contemplate the boundaries between dream and reality. In creating his art, Boghosian draws heavily on his extensive personal archive of found objects, gathered together in his home and studio. The images and objects that he utilizes often bear the mark of time and his creations frequently juxtapose groups of seemingly unrelated objects together. In describing his artistic process, Boghosian is quoted as saying \\"I don't make anything. I find everything.‚Äù Career development and recognition Boghosian's work began to be included in the thematic exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Art Institute of Chicago as early as 1954. He has also received numerous grants including a Fulbright, a Guggenheim Fellowship (1985), and residency at the American Academy in Rome with Philip Guston, and he has been an active member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters since 1968, and a National Academician of The National Academy of Design. Beginning with the Swetzoff Gallery, Boston (1950‚Äì65), Boghosian has been actively exhibiting with over 75 one-man exhibitions including the Arts Club of Chicago (1970), The American Academy in Rome (1986), the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art (1988), the Norton Gallery of Art (1992), the Hood Art Museum, Dartmouth (1989), the Toledo Museum of Art (2013), and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (2018). His work is in the public collections of Brooklyn Museum; University Art Museum of the University of California Berkeley; Indianapolis Museum of Art; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art; New York Public Library; Whitney Museum of American Art; and the Provincetown Art Association and Museum, among many others.

He personally managed his Nelson Brothers freezing works at Tomoana for nearly 40 years.Obituary, Meat Trade Founder. New Zealand Herald. 17 November 1932. Page 14. Emigration He arrived in Auckland in February 1863 with his elder brother Frederick Nelson. They settled in Hawkes Bay but their farming ventures were unsuccessful and William returned to his father's business in Warwick, England in the early 1870s leaving Fred in New Zealand. Gathering management experience in Warwick he meanwhile learnt all he could about meat preservation to export the meat otherwise wasted in New Zealand for want of consumers. Meat exports Fred and William, now back in New Zealand, established in 1880 a boiling down and canned-meat plant at Tomoana just north of Hastings in Hawke's Bay. The buildings were carefully planned for use as a refrigeration plant and laid out accordingly but the brothers waited for others to prove the best maritime refrigeration process. The first frozen meat shipment went to London from Otago in 1882. In London Frederick and brother Montague, manager of their father's Warwick gelatine factory, floated a company, Nelson Brothers Limited in May 1883 to raise capital for refrigeration machinery at Tomoana.The Times, Thursday, May 17, 1883; pg. 13; Issue 30822 In March 1884 Nelson Brothers arranged the first shipment, 9,000 sheep and six bullocks, on the sailing ship Turakina. By the middle of the 1890s Nelson Brothers Limited had the largest share of New Zealand's frozen meat export trade. In 1914 232,560 sheep, 217,908 lambs and 5,250 bullocks were slaughtered and frozen for export. Nelson Brothers Limited opened new freezing works at Waipukurau, Gisborne, Woodville and Spring Creek. Pastoral Prospering he and his brother bought pastoral land to supply stock for the works. He established one of the country's best Southdown flocks, trained young men in farm work and farm management, milled timber from his own property and supplied firewood to his freezing works' furnaces. He controlled 5,000 acres on the Heretaunga plain's flats and 30, 000 acres of hill country. He had the confidence of his workmen and his freezing works at Tomoana at this period were exceptional in having little trouble from employees' unions. His first wife died young after giving him five sons and four daughter and he remarried a daughter of Bishop William Williams who bore him another son and another daughter. Following her death he married a third time aged 79. A strong proponent of education he with others established what became Hereworth boys' preparatory school and Woodford House secondary school for girls both eventually in Havelock North. There is a Nelson Park in each of Hastings and Napier. A life-size bronze statue of William Nelson and his terrier was unveiled in Hastings in 2013 following the redevelopment of the old William Nelson park for retail use. A large part of the funds realised were used to improve local sports facilities and create William Nelson Skatepark.

Origins  In 2005, the civil initiative \\"Chas\\" ceased functioning and, in the summer of 2006, the members of the Chas movement reassembled under the new name \\"¬´Zabej!¬ª\\"; nearly all of the original membership continued under the new community formation. The launch of ¬´Zabej!¬ª was marked with a yard football tournament; this was later followed by a magazine named Zabej!Info and a number of projects: \\"Poshuk\\", \\"Hapun\\", \\"Kinobunker\\" and \\"We - to children\\".Yard football: to learn how to win Yard football tournament, Vilejka, 2009 Nomenclature According to the community's participants, the name reflects the degree of civil and political activity of young people in Belarus. \\"Zabit\\" is a slang word that means to \\"brush aside\\", \\"to shut one's eyes\\", ‚Äúto stop thinking about an issue‚Äù or \\"to neglect everything, when everything has already been neglected\\"‚Äîthe name represents the ironic attitude of the participants to a societal indifference that they perceive. It is possible to \\"zabit‚Äù on something that is old, senile and cannot be repaired; however, it is also possible to \\"zabit\\" a significant historical event. Purpose and principles The community's main aim is the creation of new rules, new values and the realisation of a new type of society, while a significant goal is the formation of a new country. The community's tasks involve the destruction of an old societal structure that is perceived as incapable and defined by a clan nature and favouritism, in addition to facilitating a new type of social and political development. Zabej has retained the main principles of Chas: activity, solidarity, criticality, alternative culture, persistence and direct action. Religion is not influential in the community, and Zabej endeavours to appraise itself and others by actions. Zabej's banner Slogans *\\"Zabej at all!\\": this slogan reflects a condition of a modern Belarusian society, whereby the passivity of social surroundings is mocked‚Äîespecially in relation to the response of the country youth to events. *\\"DIY! Football! Order!\\" (or, \\"DIY!Football! Self-organization!\\"): the slogan expresses the positive actions of the community that aim to create a new societal order through activity, such as independent publication, football and film viewings. *\\"Look! Think! Act!\\": the slogan of \\"Kinobunker\\" reflects an active approach to the viewing of video material, such as films and reports. *\\"We will return football to the streets!\\": emphasises the importance of the \\"streets\\" (public space) to the community, where it is possible to participate simply in a free form of football that is without bureaucratic and financial barriers. The principal areas of activity Football Zabej \\\\passionaries tournament 2010 Yard football (17 June 2006 is considered to be a birthday of the community)‚Äîin 2007, the location of the tournament remains the same as previous years, but the quantity of teams increases. In 2008, the tournament extends into the country's regional areas, and selections take place in Grodno and Gomel.The tournament of the yard tournament in Grodno The typical participants of the Zabej yard tournament are young people, from 16 to 23 years of age. Information about the tournament is available from publicly displayed posters, a website and social networks. The tournament's games are held over one to two days and 100 to 150 teams participate during the season; nearly 1500 matches are typically played. In 2007, a female yard football tournament commenced and a yard tournament was held in eight Belarus cities in 2009. = Zabej Passionaries‚Äô Tournament 2010 = In 2010, the community's tournament was renamed the \\"Passionaries‚Äô Tournament\\" and was held in four cities of Belarus‚Äîthe name originates from the concept of \\"passionarity\\" (the theory of Soviet historian, ethnologist and anthropologist Lev Gumilev). The main aim of the event is \\"active leisure\\", and the message that is conveyed to each participant is that any history consists of heroes and their acts. Each round of the tournament was devoted to historical characters, such as Konstanty Kalinowski, Grandfather Talash, Emilia Plater, Felix Dzerzhinsky, Konstanty Ostrogski and Vitovt. Thus, an intellectual component is incorporated into yard football, and connection is made between sport and history.Football tournament in honour of Belarusian heroes (Belarusian Radio Ratsia, on April 18th 2011 The Zabej Passionaries‚Äô Tournament of 2011 covered eight cities of the Republic: Minsk, Mogilev, Bobruisk, Baranovichi, Borisov, Molodechno, Brest, Vitebsk. = Neformals' tournament = In 2010, a new yard football project was started: the \\"Tournament of Neformals\\". The purpose of the new project was to popularise street football and informal movements through an integration of various independent bodies, amateur championships, tournaments and leagues into a one-day competition. To achieve its purpose, the project brought together ten teams from five various Minsk championships.Neformals will held a football tournament In 2011, the number of teams increased to 29 and these were taken from ten tournaments located in 12 regions of the country. The tournament also provides an opportunity for organisers and amateur teams to socialise, as well as to share the experiences gained from the organisation of local actions. The tournament is not influenced by any age restrictions or capital investments, and aims to reveal the basic needs of participants and the issue of informal sport in Belarus.Neformals' match Since inception, the community not only organises the tournament, but also participates in other open sporting events.The tournament‚Äôs favourites of \\"Malady Front\\" and \\"Zabej.info\\" (Malady Front, mfront.net) The Cover of 11th issue of Zabej!nfo  Magazine  In mid-2007, Zabej commenced a new direction with its media activity with the launch of the magazine Zabej!Info. The magazine is published bi-monthly in paper, Portable Document Format (PDF), audio and video versions. Initially, the magazine was a source of information for yard tournament participants and also covered other community projects. The range of topics that the magazine covers has extended over time, with the cultural, historical, political and economic matters of Belarus and other countries included. The magazine's target audience is passionate, socially and politically active young people.‚ÄúNew Mass Media‚Äù as the form of youth rebellion (The Magazine arche.by, on November 13th 2008) At the beginning of 2010, 11 editions had been produced, with the twelfth edition of Zabej!Info published in May 2011 (the edition is devoted to the Passionaries' Tournament). Moreover, the magazine provided a forum for Belarus' most significant musical acts.  Cinema-bunker  In January 2009, the community started to work on another educational community project called \\"Cinema- bunker\\". The main goal of the project is the examination of historical and political processes through cinema and media. Between 2009 and 2011, 24 film lectures were delivered on topics that ranged from modern art and social problems, to political and economic organisation in society. The typical structure of a Cinema-bunker lecture consists of an initial report on a problem, followed by a video viewing and then a discussion of the viewing.  Other activity  Other projects of the community Zabej include \\"Zine- meeting\\" (2008), \\"Cultural Cocktail\\" (2009) and \\"Zabej-studio\\", the latter of which is a constant work-in-progress. Another main direction is the development of local communities. = Zine-meeting = On 14 September 2008, the community Zabej held its first Zine-meeting; the meeting brought together editors from different magazines, samizdat magazines (zines) and newspapers to discuss problems and ways to develop the local mass media in Belarus.Zlot wydawc√≥w niezaleznych w Mi≈Ñsku Samizdats‚Äô makers want to make ‚Äúa new alternative public platform‚Äù (Belarusian journalists‚Äô association, on September 9th 2008) The editorial staff of Zabej!

She lived and worked in the San Francisco Bay Area and was renowned for her larger-than-life, colorfully glazed clay sculptures of men and women, which expanded the traditional boundaries of ceramic sculpture. Early life and education Born in 1933, Viola Frey grew up on her family's vineyard in Lodi, California. She received a BFA in 1956 from California College of Arts and Crafts (now California College of the Arts), where she studied painting with Richard Diebenkorn and ceramics with Vernon \\"Corky\\" Coykendall and Charles Fiske. Her fellow students included Robert Arneson, Manuel Neri and Nathan Oliveira. After receiving her bachelor's degree, she attended graduate school at Tulane University and studied with Mark Rothko and George Rickey. She left Tulane in 1957 without receiving her master's degree and moved to New York to work with ceramicist Katherine Choy at the Clay Art Center in Port Chester, New York. The Clay Art Center was one of the earliest venues on the East Coast geared toward artists exploring ceramics as a fine art medium without the functional constraints of craft. Career Frey returned to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1960 where she became an internationally respected artist and leading figure in contemporary ceramics. She was well known for her monumental, brightly colored ceramic sculptures, which explored issues of gender, cultural iconography and art history. Along with Robert Arneson and Peter Voulkos, Frey reshaped and defined the use of ceramics as a fine art medium through her robust sculptures. \\"Frey was one of a number of California artists working in clay in the 1950s and 60s who turned away from that medium's conventions to produce works with robust sculptural qualities associated with Abstract Expressionist painting, Pop art and what would come to be known as California Funk.\\" \\"Viola has had a profound impact on the visual arts. She was able to take the culture surrounding her and reform those elements into a totally original form of sculpture that defined one of the great contributions to modern art,\\" commented Michael S. Roth, former President of the California College of the Arts. In the 1970s, after moving to a larger studio in Oakland, Frey started creating her signature larger-than-life ceramic figures. Standing up to twelve feet high and constructed of separate pieces, the massive men appear in generic suits and ties, while the large female figures are often depicted in heavily patterned, 1950s-style dresses. In 1979, Viola was included in \\"A Century of Ceramics in the United States 1878-1978\\", which Garth Clark co-organized with Margie Hughto for the Everson Museum of Art. In 1981, the Minneapolis Institute of Art acquired Double Grandmother. This led to her solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1984, curated by Patterson Sims. As expressed in an essay by art critic Donald Kuspit, \\"Frey has certainly tested‚Äîaggressively stretched‚Äîthe limits of freestanding sculpture in her giant, brash, richly colored figures, but her plate pieces‚Äîessentially pictorial reliefs‚Äîare more subdued, indeed much more introverted.\\" Frey's tondo plates, ranging in size from 26 inches to 36 inches in diameter, are described by Kuspit as \\"a remarkable, innovative, contribution to ceramic sculpture, for she shows that it can be formally exciting as well as iconographically trenchant without losing its intimate touch...\\" Frey was an avid collector of ceramic figurines and other knick-knacks found in flea markets, and her vast collection of tchotchkes inspired a body of her ceramic works, which she called bricolage sculptures, based on the term used by the French anthropologist Claude L√©vi-Strauss in his book The Savage Mind. As explained by Garth Clark in his essay for Frey's 1981 retrospective exhibition, bricolage translates from French as \\"an object made by the bricoleur, a junk man or handy man... The bricoleur picks up odds and ends from his time... and makes unique projects out of unknown things.\\" Identifying with L√©vi-Strauss's description of the bricoleur, Frey made molds and slipcasts of her flea market findings to create unique ceramic assemblage works composed of a cornucopia of cascading figures and objects. Although most renowned for her ceramic sculptures, Frey also created a significant body of two-dimensional works that have been widely exhibited. Her paintings and pastel drawings reflect her love of the human figure, her colorful palette, and iconography similar to that used in her sculptures. Frey lived surrounded by art and a collection of approximately 4,000 art books. Committed to her art, she continued working almost until the end of her life. She died in Oakland, California, in 2004. Teaching career Frey joined the faculty at the California College of Arts and Crafts in 1965, and continued a relationship with the college through 1999 as full professor and chair of the Ceramics Program. During her tenure, Frey guided the design of the Noni Eccles Treadwell Ceramic Arts Center on the college's Oakland campus.

Life The daughter of a Swedish mother and a Danish father, Viola Hansen Patterson was a graduate of Lincoln High School in Seattle and completed a master program in librarianship at the University of Washington in 1921. Despite her early interest in art making, it was not until the summer after completing her B.A. that she took her first drawing class with Ambrose Patterson, a well-established painter and art professor at the University of Washington whom she eventually married in 1922. Together, they worked in Ambrose Patterson's studio in Seneca Street, where they received visits from local and international artists, and traveled extensively though Europe and Mexico to study and paint. The first woman born in Seattle to study art in Paris, Viola Hansen Patterson met and studied with some of the most prominent modernist artists of her time, including Mexican muralists Pablo O'Higgins and Diego Rivera, French purists Amedee Ozenfant and Paul Bonifas, Russian constructivist Alexander Archipenko, cubists Lyonel Feininger and Andre L'Hote, and American Expressionist Mark Tobey. She taught children's classes at the University of Washington and in conjunction with the Seattle Art Museum from 1947 to 1966. She showed her work in numerous exhibitions in Washington (including at the Seattle Art Museum and the Zo√´ Dusanne Galleryhttp://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file;_id=3863 ), Oregon, and New York.

She is the former owner and executive director of Dwan Gallery, Los Angeles (1959-1967) and Dwan Gallery New York (1965-1971), a contemporary art gallery closely identified with the American movements of Minimalism, Conceptual Art, and Earthworks. Early life and education Virginia Dwan, heiress to the Minnesota-based conglomerate 3M, was born in Minneapolis. She attended the University of California at Los Angeles to study art, but then dropped out and married a medical student in Los Angeles.Michael Kimmelman (May 11, 2003), The Forgotten Godmother Of Dia's Artists New York Times. Career Dwan leased a tiny storefront in a Spanish Mission-style building at 1091 Broxton Avenue in the Westwood section of Los Angeles in 1959.Dawson (2007), 38 The artists she presented there included Robert Rauschenberg, Yves Klein, Ad Reinhardt, Joan Mitchell, Franz Kline, Matsumi Kanemitsu and Philip Guston. In contrast to Ferus Gallery, Dwan was well funded.Scott Timberg (January 1, 2012), Galleries fostered the L.A. art scene Los Angeles Times. Dwan found a bigger space in 1962, hiring art dealer John Weber, who brought in a few of his own artists and organized some shows. In June 1962, Dwan moved to the new location at 10846 Lindbrook Drive,Dawson (2007), 43 which was twice as large as her first space. The building's renovation, which was designed by Morris Verger, a student of architect Frank Lloyd Wright, was inspired by the V.C. Morris store in San Francisco designed by the latter. Dwan organized several influential exhibitions in her new space, including \\"My Country 'Tis of Thee\\", an exhibition of Pop Art held in November 1962. This show belongs to a substantial group of exhibitions in Los Angeles between 1962 and 1963 that heralded the arrival of Pop as a major artistic style in the early 1960s.Dawson, Jessica. \\"Whatever Happened to Virginia Dwan?\\" X-TRA Contemporary Arts Quarterly.

By 1969 she closed her Westwood space, which reopened as Doug Christmas' ACE Gallery. Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty was financed in part by a $9,000 USD grant from the Virginia Dwan Gallery in 1970. A 20-year lease for the site was granted for $100 annually. Dwan then began to focus on earthworks such as the 35-Pole Lightning Field by Walter De Maria (the precursor to his Lightning Field) and Star Axis, a naked eye observatory in New Mexico. She also purchased the land for Michael Heizer's Double Negative. Legacy In 1965, the Virginia Dwan Collection, featuring artists like Willem de Kooning (Untitled, 1961), Franz Kline, Robert Rauschenberg, Claes Oldenburg, and Lee Bontecou, was exhibited at the University of California, Los Angeles.
